NOTES

The reports “Wide Partisan Gaps in U.S. Over How Far the Country Has Come on Gender Equality” and “On Gender Differences, No Consensus on Nature vs. Nurture” and some related 
Fact Tank posts used questions from both Wave 28 and Wave 29 and used only the respondents who responded to both waves. In order to replicate the analysis found in these 
publications, the weight WEIGHT_W28W29 must be applied and the data must be filtered on the variable W28W29_FLAG=1 to identify respondents to both Wave 28 and Wave 29. 
The datasets for W28 and W29 may also be combined.


There are two toplines included in this release. The topline labeled "ATP W29 topline" is weighted for the entire sample (N=4,867). This topline can be reproduced using
weighting variable WEIGHT_W29 that is described below. The second topline is labeled "ATP W28W29 topline" is based on respondents to both W28 and W29 (N=4,573). This topline
can be reproduced using weighting variable WEIGHT_W28W29 that is described below.


Responses for question TRANSGEND2A have been removed from the dataset to protect panelist confidentiality due to the very low incidence rate. Topline numbers are still available
in the published topline. 


The following variables are included in the dataset as coded open end responses. Responses to the first three mentions have been included.
DISCRHOW_W29_m1
DISCRHOW_W29_m2
DISCRHOW_W29_m3

WEIGHTS 

There are two datasets that contain different weighting variables. 

WEIGHT_W29 is the weight for the standalone W29 sample. Data for any reports using the Politics questions (PARTY, PARTYLN, GOPDIRCT, DEMDIRCT) or methods' benchmark questions
are analyzed using this weight. This weight and dataset can be found here: S:\Methodology\Panel\Panel Waves\W29\Data and Analysis\ATP W29.sav

WEIGHT_W28W29 is a longitudinal weight for N=4,573 respondents to both W28 and W29.
