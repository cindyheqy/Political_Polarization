IN HONOR OF THE UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA’S BIOSPHERE 2 RE-SEARCH FACILITY 
HON. PAUL A. GOSAR 
OF ARIZONA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, July 1, 2016 Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the faculty and students of the Univer-sity of Arizona for the work they do at Bio-sphere 2. Biosphere 2 was built in 1991. Its original purpose was to simulate different climates and biomes from around Earth and to see if it was possible to recreate the natural cycles of the earth inside a contained space. Their goal was to see if this type of habitat was sustainable and to ultimately use this technology for space colonization. Although the original experiments were un-successful, the investment in infrastructure continues to provide scientific value to this day. The University of Arizona has turned this science experiment of the 1990s into a first- class research facility with a myriad of uses. The fact that Biosphere 2 is completely sepa-rated from the rest of the environment has made it the perfect area to study some of the great challenges society faces today as they relate to the environment, water, and energy management. The work completed there has advanced mankind’s understanding of environ-ments, both natural and manmade, allowing the next generation of scientists to be better educated and trained in this field of study. The advancements in horticulture, water usage and environmental science as a result of their work are commendable. I urge them to continue pursuing their commitment to sci-entific excellence.

COMMEMORATING THE 52ND ANNI-VERSARY OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF 1964 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, July 1, 2016 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to commemorate the 52nd anniversary of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits dis-crimination in public accommodations and education institutions, and banned discrimina-tion in the workplace on the grounds of race, religion, sex, and national origin. On July 2, 1964, President Lyndon B. John-son signed the legislation that set in motion the social and economic revolution that trans-formed our country for the better and would bring about the greatest reduction in economic and social inequality among Americans in his-tory. Mr. Speaker, today it is difficult to imagine there once was a time in our country when it was illegal for African Americans and whites to eat in the same public restaurants or to use the same public restrooms. It was not so long ago, just 52 years, that it was legal to deny African Americans accom-modation at hotels, amusement parks, thea-ters, libraries, and swimming pools because they were black. But the Civil Rights Act of 1964 changed that. This change did not happen overnight or by accident. It took hard work, courage, patience, deter-mination, and most of all, an unwavering faith that America could live up to the true meaning of its creed. With American leaders embodying faith and courage the Civil Rights Act signifies battles fought over many years that our champions fi-nally won. Leaders like the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Whitney Young, Rosa Parks, and JOHN L
EWIS are just a few of the many champions who took a stand for freedom and risked their lives to make real the promise of America for all Americans. Mr. Speaker, our nation is a growing melting pot, and we must continue to make sure all American citizens, regardless of their religion, race, or gender, enjoy the freedoms, opportu-nities, and equality of treatment and oppor-tunity that makes this country the most excep-tional and indispensable nation in the history of the world. But our work is not done. Regrettably, Mr. Speaker, in too many places and areas of American life, inequalities and unfairness persist. For example, women still receive unequal pay. The majority of women do not receive paid maternity leave, women only make 79 cents per dollar earned by white men. The pay gap for women of color is even worse because African American women make 64 cents per dollar earned by white men and Latina women make 54 cents per dollar earned by white men. Our LGBT brothers and sisters still do not yet enjoy the privileges as all Americans. Victories such as the Supreme Court deci-sion on marriage equality do not overshadow the fact that those who identify as LGBT can get married on Monday, be fired by Friday, and be kicked out of their apartment by Sun-day. The fight is not over. Mr. Speaker, we still have members of mi-nority communities being killed based on the basis of the ethnicity, race, gender, religion, or sexual orientation. The fight is not over; our work is not done. Members of the LGBTQ community in too many places are treated as second class citi-zens facing workplace discrimination and sub-jected to bullying, poor mental health, and coping with disparities in access to affordable, quality health care. Recidivism rates still remain too high in part because formerly incarcerated persons find it difficult to obtain the treatment, support, and care needed to successfully reintegrate into society. Mr. Speaker, although we still have more work to do to ensure that equality of oppor-tunity and equal treatment under law is a re-ality for all Americans, we should not let that deter us from taking considerable pride in the progress we have made as a nation in the 52 years since the passage of the Civil Rights Act, which now includes marriage equality and the Supreme Court’s decision in Whole Wom-an’s Health v. Hellerstedt affirming the right of women to make their own reproductive health decisions. Social progress and justice does not always come easy or overnight but with commitment, determination, and perseverance, progress can be made and barriers broken. f 
RETIREMENT OF ASSISTANT CHIEF EARL C. PAYSINGER FROM THE LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT 
HON. KAREN BASS 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, July 1, 2016 Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, I would like to make note of the retirement of Assistant Chief Earl C. Paysinger, who has served in the Los Angeles Police Department for over four dec-ades. Appointed in 2006 as Director, Office of Op-erations, he oversaw the daily activities of over 7,000 sworn members of the Department, and previously served as Deputy Chief and Commanding Officer in Charge of Operations South Bureau. Assistant Chief Paysinger’s career has in-cluded a focus on serving children and youth. He authored the Department’s Youth First campaign and developed the LAPD Cadet Leadership Program, which has provided over 8,000 children with mentorship, resources and opportunities, and increased high school grad-uation rates for program participants. He also headed the ‘‘Project Elementoring’’ initiative that allowed newly appointed police officers to adopt and mentor a local elementary school. He enhanced the role of leadership teams in the twenty-one Area Community Relations Of-fices, including Senior Lead Officers, in engag-ing community residents and businesses. He received a Bachelor of Science degree in Criminal Justice from California State Uni-versity, Long Beach, graduated from the Fed-eral Bureau of Investigation Command Col-lege, and completed the West Point Leader-ship Command Development Program. For forty-one years, Assistant Chief Paysinger has worked to serve the people of the City and County of Los Angeles. I would like to salute him, and thank him for his serv-ice.

IN HONOR OF THE OSBOURN PARK GIRLS’ SOFTBALL TEAM 
HON. BARBARA COMSTOCK 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, July 1, 2016 Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the girls’ softball team from Osbourn Park High School in my District who recently won the 2016 6A Virginia State Championship. They practiced long hours as a team, and this achievement shows how far dedication, hard work, and commitment to teamwork can take a group as they played against some of the best competition in the nation. The Osbourn Park girls’ softball team has made Virginia’s 10th Congressional District proud and they have represented us well. Winning a state championship attests to their impressive athletic ability, unselfish mentality, and determination to succeed. I commend them for their tireless dedication to both their school and their teammates, without neither of which this could have been possible. It takes a delicate combination of superior skill and many hours of practice to win a state title. The Osbourn Park girls’ team has certainly earned this honor and the lessons learned over the years will valuably serve them as they con-tinue on in their lives. This year, Osbourn Park broke a 12 year dry spell for Prince William County softball teams by winning the county’s first statewide softball title since 2004. They played to the team’s 20th straight win this season, jumping out to a two run lead early in the game, ulti-mately dominating their opponent 4–0. This senior-less team is sure to be successful in the years to come as they practice and grow together as a hard-working team of young women. Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in honoring the Osbourn Park girls’ softball team for their achievement and representing Virginia’s 10th Congressional District with such distinction. I wish them all the best in their fu-ture endeavors.

IN HONOR OF THE 50TH ANNIVER-SARY OF THE TOWN OF JEROME, ARIZONA 
HON. PAUL A. GOSAR 
OF ARIZONA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, July 1, 2016 Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a town from my district, Jerome, Ari-zona. The Town of Jerome recently celebrated its 50th anniversary as a National Historic Land-mark. Jerome was founded in the late 1800’s on a hill near rich supplies of minerals. The town was named after one of the founders of the United Verde Copper Company that mined those very hills, and it eventually hosted the largest copper producing mine in the Arizona Territory. When it was designated a National Historic Landmark, it was proclaimed that ‘‘this site possesses national significance in commemo-rating the history of the United States of Amer-ica.’’ The Town of Jerome has been beneficial to the growth of our nation in so many ways. It has provided the copper in the wiring that spread electricity across the country as well as the materials that aided our troops in both World Wars. The Town of Jerome should be recognized not only for its historical contributions, but also for its ability to adapt and survive. During the Great Depression, many mining jobs were cut. In response, the town invested in tourism and retail sales. To increase tourism, Jerome hosts music festivals, historic-home tours, and a va-riety of businesses, such as craft stores, art galleries, coffee houses, wineries, and res-taurants. The Town of Jerome is the type of commu-nity that perseveres in difficult times and flour-ishes in prosperity. This is a model community that should inspire the rest of society to work hard in order to succeed. I would like to con-gratulate the citizens of Jerome on 50 years of preserving such a unique National Historical Landmark, and wish them years of richness and success in the future. f 
EXPRESSING CONDOLENCES TO THE VICTIMS OF THE ISTANBUL ATATURK AIRPORT ATTACK 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, July 1, 2016 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in sorrow over the loss of so many inno-cent lives cut short by the outrageous and hei-nous acts of terrorism that shocked and rocked the visitors and people in Turkey. Right now, our prayers are with the victims and their families at this terrible time. And we stand in unyielding solidarity with the visitors and people of Turkey, which like the United States, welcomes people from across the globe. Mr. Speaker, Turkey is a nation that opens its doors for tourists to see all of its beautiful attractions. Airports are a place of connection; con-necting loved ones to and from their homes. Those who think that they can terrorize the people of Turkey or the values cherished by them underestimate a nation that has faced and prevailed against far more sinister and le-thal adversaries. And they will again, but they will not con-front these adversaries alone. They will be joined by the United States and the other countries of the civilized world. The people of Turkey are justly proud of their national motto, ‘‘Egemenlik, kay(ts(z s¸arts(z milletindir,’’ (Sovereignty uncondition-ally belongs to the Nation!) and no act of ter-rorism by cowardly perpetrators will succeed in leading them to renounce their heritage of freedom or justice. It is a heritage that we here in the United States share. And that is why the civilized world must and will rededicate itself to combating and defeat-ing the source of influence of these terrorists. We will continue to face and overcome threats to our way of life together. We will not bow and will never break; we will not falter or fail. We will respond. We will endure. We will overcome. The terrorist attack in the International Istanbul Atatu¨rk Airport, is an attack on the whole world. This horrific attack on the innocent visitors and civilians perpetrated by depraved individ-uals who are yet to be named, misuse teach-ings for their own misguided purposes. Their horrible and heinous acts are their re-sponsibility, and theirs alone, and for which they can be assured that they alone will be held accountable. But that will come another day; today I ask for a moment of silence and remembrance for the victims killed and injured in the terrorist at-tack in Turkey. f 
IN HONOR OF THE CHANTILLY BOYS’ TENNIS TEAM 
HON. BARBARA COMSTOCK 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, July 1, 2016 Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the boys’ tennis team from Chantilly High School in my District who recently won the 2016 6A Virginia State Championship. They practiced long hours as a team, and this achievement shows how far dedication, hard work, and commitment to teamwork can take a group as they played against some of the best competition in the nation. The Chantilly boys’ tennis team has made Virginia’s 10th Congressional District proud and they have represented us well. Winning a state championship attests to their impressive athletic ability, unselfish mentality, and deter-mination to succeed. I commend them for their tireless dedication to both their school and their teammates, without neither of which this could have been possible. It takes a delicate combination of superior skill and many hours of practice to win a state title. The Chantilly boys’ tennis team has certainly earned this honor and the lessons learned over the years will valuably serve them as they continue on in their lives. Chantilly came into the state championship as just the three seed in the 6A North region tournament and had to beat the three higher seeded teams than them simply to qualify for the tournament. They finished the season with a record of 7–3, but came into the state tour-nament hungry for a state title and beat Cosby 5–3 to become Chantilly’s most successful boys’ tennis team. Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in honoring the Chantilly boys’ tennis team for their achievement and representing Vir-ginia’s 10th Congressional District with such distinction. I wish them all the best in their fu-ture endeavors.

U.S. C ONGRESS , C
ONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE , Washington, DC, June 24, 2016. Hon. M
ICHAEL MCCAUL, Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. D
EAR MR. CHAIRMAN : The Congressional Budget Office has prepared the enclosed cost estimate for H.R. 5389, the Leveraging Emerging Technologies Act of 2016. If you wish further details on this esti-mate, we will be pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is Mark Grabowicz. Sincerely, K
EITH HALL, Director. Enclosure. H.R. 5389—Leveraging Emerging Technologies Act of 2016 H.R. 5389 would direct the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), within six months of the bill’s enactment, to develop a strategy to work with emerging technology firms to improve DHS programs. Based on informa-tion from DHS, CBO estimates that devising the strategy would cost less than $500,000; such spending would be subject to the avail-ability of appropriated funds. Enacting the legislation would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay- as-you-go procedures do not apply. CBO esti-mates that enacting H.R. 5389 would not in-crease net direct spending or on-budget defi-cits in any of the four consecutive 10-year periods beginning in 2027. H.R. 5389 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and would not affect the budgets of state, local, or trib-al governments.

REMEMBERING BARBARA CHAR-LINE JORDAN, FIRST WOMAN AND AFRICAN AMERICAN TO DE-LIVER KEYNOTE ADDRESS AT DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CON-VENTION 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, July 1, 2016 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to commemorate an historic event. Forty years ago this month, on July 12, 1976, the legendary Barbara Charline Jordan, who held the seat I now hold made history when she became the first woman and the first African American to deliver the Keynote Address at the Democratic National Conven-tion, that nominated Jimmy Carter in New York City. Barbara Jordan indeed was a friend to many, a mentor, and an icon. Barbara Jordan was one of the first two Afri-can-Americans from the South to be elected to this body since reconstruction; the other was Andrew Young of Georgia. Barbara Jordan was a renaissance woman, eloquent, fearless, and peerless in her pursuit of justice and equality. Barbara Jordan was the first black woman elected to the Texas Senate. Ms. Jordan graduated from Texas Southern University, where she majored in government and history. While at Texas Southern University, Barbara Jordan was an active student and an es-teemed member of the prestigious debate team for 4 years, as well as a member of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority. After graduating magna cum laude from Texas Southern University in 1956, she went on to receive her law degree from Boston Uni-versity in 1959. She exhorted all of us to strive for excel-lence, stand fast for justice and fairness, and yield to no one in the matter of defending the Constitution and upholding the most sacred principles of a democratic government. Barbara Jordan retired from Congress in 1978 after serving 3 terms and was appointed a distinguished professor at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at the Univer-sity of Texas at Austin. Barbara Jordan was a lawyer, legislator, scholar, author, and presidential adviser. Barbara made history again in 1976, when she became the first African American woman to deliver keynote speeches at a Democratic National Convention. She was immensely gifted, and used every bit of her talent and skill to address, improve, and dignify the conditions of human life. In the tradition of Frederick Douglass, Martin Luther King, and Thurgood Marshall, Barbara Jordan challenged the Federal Government and the American people to uphold the prin-ciples set forth in the United States Constitu-tion and the fabric of our social mores. Barbara Jordan made a difference and be-cause of her contributions, America is a better place. f 
GARRISON KEILLOR’S FINAL ‘‘PRAIRIE HOME’’ BROADCAST 
HON. BETTY McCOLLUM 
OF MINNESOTA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, July 1, 2016 Ms. M
CCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share the news from St. Paul, Minnesota, my hometown. Garrison Keillor, one of our great storytellers in Minnesota and the nation, will be hosting ‘‘A Prairie Home Companion’’ for the final time this Saturday. As one of the most iconic shows on public radio, ‘‘Prairie Home’’ was created by Mr. Keillor more than 40 years ago. Its characters and tales sprung from his imagination, and from his wry observation of the comedies and tragedies of everyday life in the Midwest. This will be his last official appearance on stage hosting musical guests, sharing the sto-ries of Guy Noir and the Lives of the Cow-boys, and bringing us ‘‘the news from Lake Wobegon, where all the women are strong, all the men are good looking, and all the children are above average’’. Mr. Keillor created a space where families could gather around and ‘‘hear that old piano from down the Avenue’’, not to mention some of America’s most talented folk and gospel musicians. His serial skits are as much beloved for their witty wordplay as the campy characters. The gentle satire in his weekly monologues allowed us to laugh at ourselves and see America’s flaws and wisdom echoed back to us in the stories of that small town on the edge of the prairie. To many in St. Paul, however, Mr. Keillor isn’t just the soothing voice that poured out from our radios every Saturday night. He’s a treasured member of our community and my neighbor. f 
IN HONOR OF THE HANDLEY BOYS’ TENNIS TEAM 
HON. BARBARA COMSTOCK 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, July 1, 2016 Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the boys’ tennis team from Handley High School in my District who recently won the 2016 4A Virginia State Championship. They practiced long hours as a team, and this achievement shows how far dedication, hard work, and commitment to teamwork can take a group as they played against some of the best competition in the nation. The Handley boys’ tennis team has made Virginia’s 10th Congressional District proud and they have represented us well. Winning a state championship attests to their impressive athletic ability, unselfish mentality, and deter-mination to succeed. I commend them for their tireless dedication to both their school and their teammates, without neither of which this could have been possible. It takes a delicate combination of superior skill and many hours of practice to win a state title. The Handley boys’ tennis team has certainly earned this honor and the lessons learned over the years will valuably serve them as they continue on in their lives. Handley boys’ tennis team won this year’s 4A state championship to cap off an amazing 22–0 undefeated season. This state tennis title is Handley’s first in over ten years and these boys could not deserve it more. The only team to even get a point on this team after the reg-ular season was a three-time defending state champion and that was just a single point. Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in honoring the Handley boys’ tennis team for their achievement and representing Vir-ginia’s 10th Congressional District with such distinction. I wish them all the best in their fu-ture endeavors.

CELEBRATION OF EID-AL-FITR MARKING THE END OF THE HOLY MONTH OF RAMADAN 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, July 1, 2016 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in the celebration of Eid-ul-Fitr, formally marking the end of the Holy month of Rama-dan. Ramadan is a month where over 1.6 billion Muslims across the globe come together and fast for a spiritual cleanse. The fast begins daily at the rising of the sun and is completed as the sun sets—nearly 17 hours of no food or water for a month. Our fellow Muslim community is brought re-membrance of the less fortunate, who are forced to fast out of compulsion and unfortu-nate circumstances.

During this beautiful month of spiritual im-provement, our neighboring Muslims across the nation come together to build stronger re-lationships with each one of us and worship as a community. As the festivities of Eid are celebrated, I hope each one of us will continue to remem-ber those less fortunate and continue on the path of strengthening communities and build-ing bridges. I extend my warmest wishes to my Muslim constituents in Texas and here in Washington, and thank each and every one of them for their continued efforts to serve our community. This dedication is a testament to the beau-tiful faith of Islam. Eid Mubarak, or Happy Eid; I wish to you peace and prosperity in the years to come.

ONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE , Washington, DC, June 30, 2016. Hon. M
ICHAEL MCCAUL, Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. D
EAR MR. CHAIRMAN : The Congressional Budget Office has prepared the enclosed cost estimate for H.R. 5388, the Support for Rapid Innovation Act of 2016. If you wish further details on this esti-mate, we will be pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is Mark Grabowicz. Sincerely, K
EITH HALL. Enclosure. H.R. 5388—Support for Rapid Innovation Act of 2016 Current law permits the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to waive the re-quirements of the Federal Acquisition Regu-lation (procedures that guide federal pro-curement actions) for certain research and development projects. That authority (known as ‘‘other transaction authority’’) enables the department to increase its use of small contractors for research and develop-ment activities and is scheduled to expire on September 30, 2016. H.R. 5388 would extend it for four years. Based on information from DHS about the department’s research and development plans, CBO estimates that implementing H.R. 5388 would not significantly affect DHS spending for those activities. In recent years DHS has spent around $0.7 billion annually on research and development activities. En-acting the legislation would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you- go procedures do not apply. CBO estimates that enacting H.R. 5388 would not increase net direct spending or on- budget deficits in any of the four consecutive 10-year periods beginning in 2027. H.R. 5388 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and would not affect the budgets of state, local, or trib-al governments. The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Mark Grabowicz. The estimate was approved by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy Assistant Director for Budget Analysis. IN HONOR OF THE CHANTILLY BOYS’ BASEBALL TEAM 
HON. BARBARA COMSTOCK

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, July 1, 2016 Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the boys’ baseball team from Chan-tilly High School in my District who recently won the 2016 6A Virginia State Championship. They practiced long hours as a team, and this achievement shows how far dedication, hard work, and commitment to teamwork can take a group as they played against some of the best competition in the nation. The Chantilly boys’ baseball team has made Virginia’s 10th Congressional District proud and they have represented us well. Winning a state championship attests to their impressive athletic ability, unselfish mentality, and deter-mination to succeed. I commend them for their tireless dedication to both their school and their teammates, without neither of which this could have been possible. It takes a delicate combination of superior skill and many hours of practice to win a state title. The Chantilly boys’ baseball team has certainly earned this honor and the lessons learned over the years will valuably serve them as they continue on in their lives. This team unfortunately had come up short the previous two years, and came into this year’s final determined to be victorious. Seven innings into the state championship final, they found themselves down two scores to their zero. Thinking back to the previous two years of disappointment, they dug deep and rallied to score three quick runs to win the state title by just one run in an exhilarating fashion. Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in honoring the Chantilly boys’ baseball team for their achievement and representing Virginia’s 10th Congressional District with such distinction. I wish them all the best in their fu-ture endeavors.

TRIBUTE TO LT. COL. EILEEN MARIE COLLINS, TRAILBLAZING FIRST WOMAN NASA SPACE SHUTTLE FLIGHT COMMANDER 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, July 1, 2016 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as the representative of the 18th Congressional Dis-trict of Texas, and on behalf of its constituents within the City of Houston, which is home to the Johnson Space Center, I rise to pay trib-ute to Lt. Colonel Eileen Marie Collins, the first woman to command a Space Shuttle mission in the long and storied history of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Lt. Colonel Eileen Marie Collins was born in Elmira, New York on November 19, 1956. As a child, Eileen Collins dreamed about space and of becoming an astronaut. The Collins family wanted the young Eileen to attend college but did not have the money to send her. So after graduating from high school, Eileen Collins attended Corning Community College where her hard work and superior academic performance enabled her to win a scholarship to Syracuse University, from which she grad-uated in 1978 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in mathematics and economics. Not stopping there, Eileen Collins went on to earn a Master of Science degree in oper-ations research from Stanford University and a Master of Arts degree in space systems man-agement from Webster University. In 1979, Eileen Collins graduated from Air Force Undergraduate Pilot Training at Vance Air Force Base and was commissioned as an officer, where her excellent performance earned her several promotions, up to and in-cluding her current rank of Lieutenant Colonel. In 1990, while attending the Air Force Test Pilot School, Eileen Collins was selected for the astronaut program and realized her child-hood dream of becoming an astronaut when she completed her training and earned her ap-pointment as a NASA astronaut. Just four short years later, Eileen Collins made history when she became the first woman to pilot a Space Shuttle mission (STS– 9) on February 2, 1995. Lt. Col. Collins made history once again on July 23, 1999, when she became the first woman to command a Space Shuttle mission. Lt. Colonel Collins is also a wife and moth-er, but on top of all these titles and distinctions she is an inspiration for many women through-out the world. Mr. Speaker, the extraordinary achieve-ments of Lt. Colonel Eileen Marie Collins are a tribute to her hard work and perseverance, but they also reflect favorably upon the nation that made it possible for her to take advantage of opportunities that enabled her to realize her dreams. In the end, this is what really makes Amer-ica great. From Sally Ride to Mae Jemison, women pioneers in the space program have made great strides in opening doors and opportuni-ties for women and because of them no dream is impossible for American women, whether it is commanding a NASA space shut-tle or becoming President of the United States. f

children do not have to wait longer for these important reforms. Voice for Adoption (VFA) is a national advocacy organization with a mission to speak in a single voice with policy-makers, representing the inter-ests of more than 100,000 foster children awaiting adoption and the families who adopt them. The Family First Prevention Services Act would allow adoptive families to receive needed post-adoption services by allowing states to use Title IV–E funds to pay for up to 12 months of family services that can pre-vent children from reentering foster care, and help keep the children safely in their adoptive families. While the Families First Prevention Serv-ices Act would delay final implementation of additional federal adoption assistance reim-bursement for the adoptions of infants and toddlers, VFA is willing to support this delay as a way to extend needed services. VFA was pleased to see a Government Ac-countability Office (GAO) study that will ex-amine compliance with the Fostering Con-nections to Success and Increasing Adop-tions Act of 2008 (P.L. 110–135) requirement that states reinvest the state funds freed up by providing additional federal reimburse-ment. Beyond the important post-adoption sup-port this Act will provide, the Family First Prevention Services Act takes important steps to ensure children who need care will be placed in the least-restrictive, most fam-ily-like setting appropriate to their needs. VFA will offer our continued support in the implementation of the Families First Prevention Services Act to ensure that the voice of the adoption community is heard— specifically to assure that the Act does pro-vide critical post-adoption services that as-sist in keeping children with their adoptive families and helps children to avoid reen-tering the foster care system and in crafting the GAO report. VFA looks forward to working with all of you to make the proposed improvements for children in the Family First Prevention Services Act (H.R. 5456) a reality. Thank you for your continuing leadership on behalf of the most vulnerable children and their fami-lies. Sincerely yours, S

IN REMEMBRANCE OF CAPITOL HILL POLICE OFFICERS JOHN GIBSON AND JACOB CHESTNUT 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, July 1, 2016 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, 18 years ago, the world tragically lost two Capitol police officers when a gunman shot his way into the Capitol and, in a barrage of violent chaos, took the lives of Officers John Gibson and Jacob J. Chestnut. I rise today to commemorate the tragic deaths of these two courageous officers, in the hopes of remembering that the safety we often take for granted here on Capitol Hill is both delicate and precious. On July 24, 1998, at a time when the Cap-itol was packed with tourists and staff alike, a gunman sparked mass panic and chaos when he shot his way through a security checkpoint, killing two Capitol police officers. The shooting was the first in the Capitol in nearly fifty years, and the worst since Con-gress first met in the Capitol in 1800. In just a moment, the tranquility of the Cap-itol was transformed into a scene of chaos and pandemonium, as staffers and tourists alike ran for their lives. After the shooter failed to bypass a security checkpoint’s metal detector, he immediately shot and killed Officer Chestnut, and later ex-changed gunfire with Officer Gibson before fa-tally shooting him as well. Having been wounded by Officer Gibson be-fore he managed to fatally hit the Officer, the gunman was overwhelmed by Capitol officers soon thereafter. I rise today to remember and honor the lives of these fallen officers, who tragically died in true service of public safety, democracy, and the United States of America. While our beloved Capitol has fortunately not seen such a violent disregard for life since, it is important to remember that we are all united in the fragility and beauty of human life, and that it is easy to take for granted our basic safety in our day-to-day lives. As President John F. Kennedy once said, ‘‘A man does what he must in spite of per-sonal consequences, in spite of obstacles and dangers and pressures, and that is the basis of all human mortality.’’ The lives of officers Chestnut and Gibson exemplified and embodied this idea in the most sincere way possible. They gave their lives in protection of ours, so that we may continue to effect positive change on our country. In the immediate aftermath of the shooting, the reaction of the Capitol was one of sad-ness, shock, and outrage. As we have said here before, however, ‘‘The worst thing we can do is cower in fear. We will not shut down the Capitol.’’ It is this attitude of remembrance and re-spect without any trace of fear or cowardice that we must take from the tragic deaths of these officers. As members of Congress, we must continue to remember the lives of the men who gave theirs for ours. But we must also learn from them. We must take with us the importance of continuing to stand for our country without fear or cowardice, as Officers Gibson and Chestnut once did for us. Today, we pause to commemorate and re-member the brave officers who passed away eighteen years ago. Tomorrow, we take up the mantle that they once did for us. IN RECOGNITION OF THE STER-LING VOLUNTEER FIRE COM-PANY’S 50TH ANNIVERSARY HON. BARBARA COMSTOCK 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, July 1, 2016 Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to ac-knowledge the Sterling Volunteer Fire Com-pany, which is celebrating its 50th year of service to the good citizens of the Sterling community this year. I would like to personally commend the courageous men and women who so selflessly volunteer themselves and put themselves in danger on behalf of neigh-bors, friends, and strangers, without asking anything in return. These brave citizens em-body the very best of this nation’s values through their service to our community and their exemplary performance in the line of duty. The Sterling Volunteer Fire Company has grown exponentially since its inception in 1966, which at the time was little more than an old barn on Holly Avenue housing a single tanker and two used pumpers. Within a short two years, this small institution had flourished, now settled into two larger locations: Station 11, which it shares with the Sterling Volunteer Rescue Squad, as well as Station 18, also known as SVRS 25. Even more recently, the company expanded into Station 24 in 2013. This is a clear testament to the outstanding work which is conducted by these everyday heroes and they are deserving of recognition. Mr. Speaker, it brings me immense pride to recognize such a fine group, and I sincerely hope that we all can live up to their tremen-dous example. I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the Sterling Volunteers. I wish them good luck and hope that they re-main safe in the fulfillment of their future du-ties.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Brent Offenberger, Luke Offenberger, and Chris Atwell for their heroic efforts in rescuing three U.S. Navy helicopter crew members who crashed into the James River during a routine training mission on June 14, 2016. All three men should be recognized for their selfless attitude and willingness to help those in need. Brent Offenberger was fishing with his son, Luke, and father-in-law, Chris, when they saw a U.S. Navy MH–60S helicopter flying at low altitude near their boat. While it is not uncom-mon to see helicopters in the area, the men noticed the helicopter was having issues as it began to hover a mere ten feet above the sur-face, throwing water into the air. Soon after, the propeller hit a metal buoy and shattered into pieces. Immediately after the propeller hit

the buoy, the men sprang into action to lend assistance to the crew. Approximately 30 seconds after the heli-copter went down, the family was at the crash site and began assisting the crew members who were in the water. Because of the swift actions of these men, the entire crew was pulled to safety without any serious injuries. While the Navy is still investigating the inci-dent to find out what went wrong, I am thank-ful these good Samaritans were there to lend a hand. It is an honor to celebrate their ac-tions today. Mr. Speaker, please join me today in recog-nizing these fine men for exhibiting bravery and fortitude in helping rescue the crew of the downed U.S. Navy helicopter.

COMMEMORATING THE 99TH ANNI-VERSARY OF THE PASSAGE OF THE NATIONAL PARK SERVICE ACT 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, July 1, 2016 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the centennial anniver-sary of the passage of the ‘‘National Park Service Act’’. Because of the ‘‘National Park Service Act,’’ the history and heritage of America is being preserved to teach and inspire future genera-tions. Since the mid-19th century, the National Park Service is responsible for carrying out the Historic Sites, Buildings, and Antiquities Act, the National Historic Preservation Act, and other laws relating to protecting and pre-serving sites that illustrate America’s history. The Centennial is about celebrating the achievements of the past 100 years, but today is about the future. Today is the start of a second century of stewardship. As many as 407 national parks inspire com-munity-based recreation, conservation, and history preservation programs that positively impact their own communities. According to the National Park Service, the economic contributions brought to the United States economy was $32 billion dollars in eco-nomic output and provided 295,000 jobs na-tionwide. Texas is a proud home to 14 National Parks, 20 National Natural Landmarks, and 46 National Historic Landmarks. In areas surrounding Houston, Texas, there are wonderful national parks including the Brazos Bend State Park, Galveston Island State Park, Huntsville State Park, Stephen F. Austin State Park and Lake Livingston State Park. Tourists also enjoy educational sites and centers in the Houston Area as well, including the Sheldon Lake State Park and Environ-mental Learning Center, the Fanthorp Inn State Historic Site, and the San Jacinto Battle-ground State Historic Site. It’s no wonder that in 2015, 5,044,926 peo-ple visited national parks in Texas. National Park Service estimates tourism in Texas contributed $372.6 million in economic output and supplied 4,100 jobs statewide. The Centennial of the National Park Service is a day we acknowledge and celebrate the fruits of our investment, for every dollar in-vested in the National Park Service generates $10 in economic activity. Investing in protecting America’s National Parks is the right thing to do for our environ-ment, for our people, and for our economy. On the birthday of our nation’s National Park Service, let us continue robust invest-ment in protecting our environment and also improving the lives of millions of people. I also want to commemorate the bipartisan efforts made leading to this day through pass-ing H.R. 1068, ‘‘Title 54, United States Code, National Park System,’’ becoming a law in De-cember of 2014. As we recall the great efforts made by Con-gress in the past century, let us also bear in mind the importance of continued bipartisan support as we embark upon this next century of protecting our beloved national parks. f 
IN HONOR OF ANDREW SHAPIRO’S SIGNIFICANT ACCOMPLISHMENT TO RAISE MONEY TO FIGHT CAN-CER 
HON. BARBARA COMSTOCK 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, July 1, 2016 Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, please allow me to take a moment to recognize the significant accomplishments of Andrew Sha-piro, a remarkable individual from my district. A junior at Langley High School in McLean, Virginia, Andrew has dedicated his time to breaking three world records in the name of cancer research. Andrew’s passion for combating cancer is laudable. Inspired by his father’s battle against colon cancer, over the past year Andrew dedi-cated his time and energy towards training for the Relay For Life event held in Fairfax Coun-ty, Virginia. Preparing for several months, Andrew broke the world records for the most pullups over 6- hour, 12-hour, and 24-hour periods on Satur-day, May 14th, as part of the annual fund-raiser. Andrew completed 7,306 pullups over the course of 18 hours, raising over $7,000 dollars for the American Cancer Society. It is estimated that there will be 43,190 new cancer diagnoses in Virginia alone, resulting in an es-timated 14,910 deaths. The money that An-drew raised will go towards giving cancer pa-tients and caregivers free lodging for a year at an American Cancer Society Hope Lodge. This enables patients to concentrate less on how they will afford to stay near their treat-ment centers, and more on staying strong in their fight against cancer. In the future, An-drew hopes to qualify for American Ninja War-rior, a sports entertainment competition in which athletes compete in a series of obstacle courses that increase in difficulty at each stage. In closing, Mr. Speaker, I ask that my col-leagues join me in sending our most sincere congratulations to Andrew Shapiro for his ath-letic accomplishments and fundraising efforts for the American Cancer Society. His actions will have an incredible impact on others who have also been affected by cancer. f 
HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, July 1, 2016 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak today on the importance of Hispanic Heritage Month (HHM.) American society today embraces a remark-able breadth of cultures, and Hispanics are an integral part of this diversity. The Hispanic American community is a beautiful array of distinct groups, including people with roots in Central and South Amer-ica, Mexico, the Caribbean, and Spain. In 1968 President Lyndon Johnson des-ignated a National Hispanic Heritage Week because of the growing impact of the Latin American culture in shaping the nation and so-ciety. The week was expanded in 1988 to a 31– day period to provide all Americans the oppor-tunity to participate and commemorate the contributions of the Hispanic culture to main-stream America. Today in communities across the nation mil-lions of American families come together to celebrate in this facet of American culture and participate in traditional comidas and fiestas. There are over 54 million Hispanics living in the U.S. and Hispanics continue to be the fastest growing ethnic group. Harris County has the second largest His-panic population in the United States. In 2010, 43.8 percent of the Houston popu-lation identified as Hispanic or Latino in the Census. On behalf of my constituents and in my du-ties as a U.S. Representative, I am committed to speaking up for the rights of Hispanics and confronting the issues that affect them. From lowering the uninsured rates and fight-ing to make higher education more affordable, to championing an increase in the minimum wage and addressing the economic chal-lenges facing working women and families, my colleagues and I will continue working for the Latino community’s top priorities. Devoted to family, faith, country, and hard work, Hispanic Americans bring unique and bountiful perspectives and experiences to our national community and character. The vibrant Hispanic influence can be seen in all aspects of American life and culture, from distinctive cuisine to colorful festivals, and from the rhythms and melodies of tradi-tional music to the contagious beat of today’s most popular songs. The Hispanic community has persevered in the face of discrimination and hardships. While significant barriers still stand in our way, I will continue fighting with a strong com-mitment, to achieve comprehensive immigra-tion reform and to support an inclusive and unified country.
