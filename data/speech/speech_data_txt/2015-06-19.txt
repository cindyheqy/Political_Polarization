CELEBRATING THE LIFE, LEGACY 
AND WORK OF HARLEM ACTIV-IST MINNIE MOORE 
HON. CHARLES B. RANGEL 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, June 19, 2015 
Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
celebrate the life, legacy, and work of Harlem Activist Minnie Moore was a dear friend, a dy-namic political activist and an excellent com-munity service provider. She was a devout Christian that lived her life with an indomitable spirit of love and giving. She was a compas-sionate, hard working, and socially responsible individual that gave several decades of service that strengthen the entire community. On June 20, at Harlem’s historic Abyssinian Baptist Church, the Africana community gathers to memorialize Minnie Moore’s contributions to the Harlem community. Minnie Moore was born on June 28, 1921 to the late Claudia and Joseph Gassaway. She married her childhood sweetheart, Cleveland Moore (now deceased) and came with him to Harlem, New York from Dothan Alabama during the Great Migration north. 
As a life-long resident of Harlem, New York 
for more than 70 years, the impact of her mer-itorious service spanned many decades. In the early sixties Minnie was instrumental in incor-porating the New York City Housing Authority Saint Nicholas Houses first tenants’ associa-tion. Over a 10-year period she served in var-ious offices including treasurer, vice-president and president. For many years Minnie was also a faithful member of the Mt. Nebo Baptist Church under the spiritual direction of the late Rev. William D. Gardner. 
Minnie was a ‘fireball’ and worked tirelessly 
to support many outstanding political figures during their burgeoning years. In the 1970’s and 1980’s during the ‘War on Poverty’, Min-nie Moore worked diligently and side-by-side with me, and my brothers Percy Ellis Sutton, David N. Dinkins and Basil Paterson. Other Harlem elites include The Hon. George Miller, The Hon. H. Carl McCall, The Hon. Fred Sam-uels, The Hon. Hilton Clark and The Hon. Keith L.T. Wright. 
She was ecstatic at the election of President 
Obama and held great appreciation in knowing her years of community service and political activism must have contributed in some meas-ure to this monumental, historical occurrence. 
Though she was the granddaughter of 
slaves and did not complete her college edu-cation, Minnie Moore touched the hearts of the entire Harlem community. Minnie established the Harriet Tubman Block Association, which provided an array of programmatic activities including educational and social services to children and families through summer youth programs; recreational activities; annual block parties; support to struggling artists; after- school homework assistance; on-going work-shops on critical social and health-related issues; pantries, flea markets; and donations of holiday baskets for Thanksgiving and 
Christmas. 
In addition to serving as Executive Director 
of the Harriet Tubman Block Association, Min-nie held many positions of service and leader-ship within the New York area including Past- Worthy Matron of the Eastern Star, Universal Chapter #7; Captain of the 127th Street Block Association, Member Officer of HARYOU; Secretary for Community Board #10: Execu-tive President of the Park Avenue North Color Guard; Executive President of the St. Nicholas Cavaliers Junior, Senior & All-Girls Softball Teams; Democratic County Committee Mem-ber and an Alternate Delegate to the Demo-cratic National Convention in 1984. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my distin-
guished colleagues join me in recognizing our beloved Mother Minnie Moore and her con-tributions that has positively impacted the Har-lem community and countless citizens across this Nation. Her dedication, commitment, and spiritual guidance is worthy of our Nation’s highest esteem. Minnie was a family treasure and community icon. Her kindness, generosity and wisdom will truly be missed.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE TWEN-
TIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE COALITION FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE 
HON. WILLIAM R. KEATING 
OF MASSACHUSETTS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, June 19, 2015 
Mr. KEATING. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the twentieth anniversary of the Co-alition for Social Justice (CSJ) based in South-eastern Massachusetts. 
For twenty years, the CSJ has been dedi-
cated to the praiseworthy goal of building a grassroots movement for progressive social change, rooted in low-income communities and communities of color that have been ex-cluded from the economic benefits of the cur-rent system. 
The CSJ has a dual focus: to recruit and 
develop its own leaders from low income backgrounds; and to organize effective cam-paigns to address the economic survival issues that low-income communities and com-munities of color face. CSJ’s agenda includes: funding essential community services through progressive taxes, worker’s rights, housing, health care, education, welfare, criminal justice reform, immigrant rights, and environmental justice. 
CSJ has actively participated in advocating 
for the needs of working-class families. For example, in 2014 CSJ helped increase min-imum wage in Massachusetts, and also helped earn sick time for all workers in Massa-chusetts. In 2011, CSJ helped to restore the children’s clothing allowance of $150 per year per child so children were able to start the school year with suitable clothing. These ex-amples represent only a small fraction of CSJ’s commendable work. Mr. Speaker, please join me in congratu-
lating the CSJ on its twentieth year anniver-sary. It gives me great pride to recognize them for all of the admirable work they do for those in need.

ON THE TRADE FACILITATION 
AND TRADE ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2015 
HON. JOHN CONYERS, JR. 
OF MICHIGAN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, June 19, 2015 
Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, although I op-
pose H.R. 644, the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015, I rise in sup-port of Section 302 of the bill because it wisely allows Customs and Border Protection (CBP) the flexibility to determine when there is a sus-picion that goods are counterfeit. The section clarifies that CBP shall consult with Intellectual Property (IP) owners and preserves the flexi-bility of customs to first consult as appropriate with the importer. However, it does not direct CBP to modify in any particular way its proce-dures regarding notice to importers prior to de-termining whether there is a suspicion that their detained goods are possibly counterfeit. This should result in earlier and more accurate decisions by CBP and preserve the ability of lawful importers to protect their confidential in-formation from disclosure. 
I am aware of cases where importers of 
genuine material have suffered significant and real costs because of CBP suspicions that the material was counterfeit. These losses oc-curred because shipments that were detained or seized were ultimately determined to be genuine and released long after their arrival and expected delivery dates. For example, in one case, a company suffered delays and in-creased costs for over 17 shipments that were seized or intensively examined by CBP over a three-month period after which all of the goods were ultimately determined to be genuine and 
were released long after their arrival and ex-pected delivery dates. In another case, a com-pany reported one shipment was seized and another one was detained for more than 30 days before both of these shipments were found to be genuine and were released. As a result of these long delays, the importers in each of these cases suffered significant costs for storage, brokerage, legal fees, product damage, and losses in customer good will. 
I thank Chairman R
YANas well as the other 
Ways & Means Committee members who re-main as committed as I am to preventing counterfeit merchandise from crossing our bor-ders. I look forward to working with them to ensure smooth implementation of this new pol-icy.

CELEBRATING THE LIFE, LEGACY 
AND WORK OF REVEREND DR. JAMES E. GUNTHER 
HON. CHARLES B. RANGEL 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, June 19, 2015 
Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, today I rise 
today to recognize and honor the life of Rev-erend Dr. James E. Gunther, the well re-spected Pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, ecumenist and an elder among African American Lutheran Pastors. I am honored to acknowledge the life and con-tributions of one of Harlem’s forward thinking religious leaders of the 21st century. 
On June 20th, at Harlem’s historic Trans-
figuration Lutheran Church, the Harlem com-munity gathers to memorialize Dr. Gunther. He devoted his life to enlightening African Ameri-cans and is noted for illuminating our spiritual enlargement to embrace a global unification and cultural learning. 
Reverend Dr. James E. Gunther served the 
Harlem community and was a man of pur-pose, passion and true conviction in service to others. Known as a ‘‘Poor, Humble, Parish priest, he served for a brief time at Nativity Lu-theran Church and Tabernacle Lutheran Church, Philadelphia, as part of the Center City Lutheran Parish, before moving on to Transfiguration Lutheran Church in Harlem where he served for 38 years, retiring in 1998. A year later he was named Pastor Emeritus. 
A life-long teacher, leader and visionary, he 
led a large parish with many Caribbean roots at the Transfiguration Lutheran Church. He was a member of the Governing Board of the National Council of Churches of Christ in the USA (NCC) representing the Lutheran Church of America (LCA). A Humanitarian, he served as a Board member of the National Committee of Black Churchmen. Focusing on Economic Justice Working Group, the Division of Over-seas Ministry and the Committee on Research and Planning, he served as a Board member of the National Committee of Black Church-men. 
Through Reverend Gunther, illustrious lead-
ership, he founded and chaired the Harlem College Assistance Project from 1964–1977 sending more than 5,000 young black and Hispanic students to college. An inspiriting thought leader, he served on the Harlem Urban Development Corporation, the Board of the Roosevelt Island Corporation, the New York Urban Coalition and the Ministerial Inter-faith Association. 
A man way ahead of his time, Dr. Gunther, 
was born on May 5, 1932 in Philadelphia, PA. Educated in Philadelphia Public Schools, he 
continued his collegiate journey attending the University of Pennsylvania. He holds degrees from Philadelphia College of the Bible, Hough-ton College, the Lutheran Theological Semi-nary at Philadelphia, and Harvard University with studies in Psychology, Religion, Theology and Church and Society. 
A worldwide global vanguard, Dr. Gunther 
served on the Executive council of the LCA and represented the church at the 1977 Sixth Assembly of the Lutheran World Federation in Dar es Salaam, East Africa, working on the Statement Human Rights and the Statement on South Africa. Dr. Gunther encouraged all that he met ‘‘To Think Globally While Acting Locally’’. In addition, Dr. Gunther served as Trustee 
of Susquehanna University, Selinsgrove, PA; Wagner College, Staten Island, NY and Muh-lenberg University, Allentown, PA. He subse-quently served as a Board Member of Augs-burg Fortress Publishers, an Adjunct Professor at Christ Bible College, Malcolm King College (associated with Fordham University and Marymount-Manhattan College, and the Lu-theran Theological Seminary at Philadelphia. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my distin-
guished colleagues join me in recognizing Reverend Dr. James E. Gunther, and his con-tributions and innovations that have positively impacted the quality of life for countless citi-zens across this Nation. His unwavering dedi-cation, commitment, and spiritual guidance is worthy of our Nation’s highest esteem.

INTRODUCTION OF THE ‘‘KEEP 
OUR PENSION PROMISES ACT’’ 
HON. MARCY KAPTUR 
OF OHIO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, June 19, 2015 
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
introduce the ‘‘Keep Our Pension Promises Act.’’ 
Pensions are one of the surest means to af-
ford millions of middle class families an oppor-tunity for security in retirement, to enjoy their golden years without being afraid that they haven’t saved enough money or what they have saved could run out. Pensions guarantee our senior citizens will know they have a check arriving every month for as long as they live. This is true retirement security. 
For forty years the federal pension law has 
ensured that retirees are given the highest level of protection. For forty years, the Em-ployee Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA, controlled that pension benefits in mul-tiemployer plans should be cut only when a plan runs out of money—and even then, the benefits of retirees should be the last to be cut. This has held tried and true because it was the right thing to do. Retirees worked their entire life to earn the promise and benefit of a guaranteed pension. 
This was all uprooted by Congress’ Decem-
ber vote on the Omnibus funding bill. A provi-sion that was stuck into the 1,600 page Omni-bus bill, at the last minute, forced a decision between shutting down the government and cutting retiree’s pension benefits for the first time ever. 
An estimated 1 million participants, including 
retirees, are in multi-employer pension plans that federal officials say are in danger of run-ning out of money in the near future. The pro-vision Congress passed allowed for the first time for the benefits of current retirees to be cut as part of a deal to address the fiscal dis-tress confronting some of the nation’s multi- employer pension plans, having a direct im-pact on 1.5 million American retirees. 
This was wrong and today I introduce the 
‘‘Keep Our Pension Promises Act’’ with Sen-ator B
ERNIE SANDERS of Vermont, to correct 
this short sighted effort. 
This Act corrects the injustices bestowed 
upon our most vulnerable retirees by restoring anti-cutback rules so that retirees in financially troubled multi-employer pension plans are pro-tected from having their earned benefits cut. It will allow plans to partition off ‘‘orphaned’’ 
participants into a separate plan, giving partici-pating employers relief from having to shoul-der the full financial burden and risk of under-funded ‘‘orphaned’’ participants—ensuring the ability for plans to become financially secure once more. 
Recognizing that funding is the ultimate con-
cern, the act shores up the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp and creates a legacy fund to ensure participants in partitioned plans will continue to receive the benefits they depend upon. The costs to create this fund are cov-ered by closing tax loopholes the very wealthy use to accumulate expensive artwork and avoid estate and gift taxes. 
Further the bill ensures pension obligations 
are prioritized during bankruptcies, which will help the remaining employers in the plan by making it less likely they become responsible for underfunded orphan plans. 
Our pension system has allowed our senior 
citizens the opportunity to enjoy their years of hard work in retirement and receive the pay-outs they spent a life time to earn. This effort recognizes that shared sacrifices are the ap-propriate course of action to address weak-ness in pension plans. I encourage my col-leagues to support this measure and correct the misguided action passed in last year’s Omnibus funding bill.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 250TH AN-
NIVERSARY OF SHARON, MASSA-CHUSETTS 
HON. WILLIAM R. KEATING 
OF MASSACHUSETTS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, June 19, 2015 
Mr. KEATING. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
celebrate the 250th anniversary of the found-ing of Sharon, Massachusetts, a town whose slogan ‘‘A Better Place to Live Because It’s Naturally Beautiful’’ is uncontroverted. Sharon’s landscape represents a classic New England destination with its tree-lined streets, pristine white church spires encasing bells manufactured by Paul Revere, its forested high plains and the peacefulness of Lake Massapoag. 
First settled in 1637 as part of the Massa-
chusetts Bay Colony, Sharon was established as the 2nd precinct of its neighboring town Stoughton in 1740. On June 21, 1765, an act passed by the Council and the House of Rep-resentatives and signed by Governor Bernard incorporated the second precinct of Stoughton into the district named Stoughtonham. It was subsequently named after the Sharon plains in Israel due to its plentiful forests and greenery. Engrained in the history of Sharon is the strength of its townspeople who manufactured weapons for the Continental Army during the American Revolution. The heroism of the colo-nial townspeople of Sharon is exemplified by the historical figure Deborah Sampson, a woman who disguised herself as a man in order to display her patriotism by fighting for her country in the Revolutionary War. 
Present day Sharon has become a beacon 
for its thriving culture. Local artists and busi-nesses have contributed to the unique char-acter of this charming Massachusetts town. 
A boisterous population of 18,000 individ-
uals inhabit Sharon, providing the town with

diversity of race, religion, and personalities. 
But one thing is a constant in Sharon: the friendliness of its townspeople. As my home-town, where I resided for over half a century, I had the pleasure of a place that valued the meaning of friendship. The people of Sharon are kind, tolerant, spirited and it is due to their love of neighborliness that Sharon has been able to remain a steadfast community, truly representing the very best that our Common-wealth and our country has to offer. 
Mr. Speaker, please join me in celebrating 
the 250th anniversary of Sharon, Massachu-setts. May this beautiful Massachusetts town flourish for many years to come.

TRIBUTE TO COL. PETE 
HILGARTNER 
HON. BARBARA COMSTOCK 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, June 19, 2015 
Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to re-
member a truly selfless resident of Great Falls, Virginia, Col. Pete Hilgartner. 
Not long after graduating high school Col. 
Hilgartner began his service to our nation by enlisting in the U.S. Marine Corps. He re-ceived a fleet appointment to the U.S. Naval Academy and upon graduation in 1951 was commissioned a 2nd Lieutenant in the U.S. Marine Corps. 
During the Korean War, he served as an ar-
tillery forward observer and received the Bronze Star with Combat ‘‘V’’ for meritorious conduct against the enemy in these actions. 
In Vietnam, he commanded the 1st Bat-
talion, Fifth Marine Regiment, the most deco-rated combat battalion in the U.S. Marine Corp. His tour as Battalion Commander of a frontline Marine Infantry Battalion was one of the longest of any during the war and his bat-talion fought in numerous actions, including every major action that occurred in the 1st Marine Division sector from November 1966 to September 1967. His six and a half foot stat-ure earned him the name ‘‘Highpockets’’ by his Marines, who loved him for his com-petency and his concern for his men’s welfare. Under his command, his unit received two 
Presidential Unit Citations, for Operations Union, Union II, and Swift. Col. Hilgartner him-self was awarded twice the Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry with Palm, the Legion of Merit, and the Silver Star medal, for gallantry in com-bat during Operation Swift. 
Upon completion of his first tour, Col. 
Hilgartner completed a Master’s degree only to return for an additional tour as a staff officer in Saigon eventually achieving the rank of Colonel by the time of his retirement from ac-tive duty in 1972. From there he would transi-tion into a successful career in the brokerage investment business, author of two books and serve as an active member of the community; holding multiple roles as a Virginia Hunter Education Instructor, President of both the McLean Rotary Club and Northern Virginia Brittany Club, and in the aftermath of Sep-tember 11th led the Great Falls Memorial Committee helping create the Great Falls Me-morial in the remembrance of those lost in the September 11th attacks. 
Col. Hilgartner is survived by his wife, Sara 
Hilgartner, his five children by his first wife, Frances Haynes Hilgartner: Linda Bassett, Diana Boyd, Dale Cirillo, David Hilgartner, and Paul Hilgartner, 10 grandchildren, five great- grandchildren, his stepson Greg Fernlund and his step-grandchildren. ‘‘Uncle Pete’’ was also a loving uncle and grandfather to his de-ceased brother Fielding’s 5 children and 11 grandchildren. 
Col. Hilgartner will always be remembered 
for his heroic service to his nation and will truly be missed by all of the many lives that he touched and enriched.

CELEBRATING THE LIFE, LEGACY, 
AND WORK OF CLEMENTE PUGH 
HON. CHARLES B. RANGEL 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, June 19, 2015 
Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to 
celebrate the life, legacy, and work of my dear distinguished friend, Clemente Pugh who was affectionately known to all of as ‘‘Clem’’. As a strong believer in the power of knowledge, she 
demonstrated the importance of learning and expanding educational opportunities to women and African Americans throughout our great Nation. On June 20th, at Harlem’s historic, The Riverside Church, family and community gathers to memorialize Clem’s life and con-tributions to opening our minds to the impor-tance of culture, honesty, and knowledge. 
On April 11, 1925, Clemente was born to Al-
berta and Otho High in Raleigh, North Caro-lina. She attended Shaw University where she earned a Bachelor of Arts degree. She began her career as a psychiatric social worker, mov-ing on to becoming a public school teacher and eventually, a professor at Hunter and Leh-man Colleges of the City University of New York. After 20 years of service at Lehman Col-lege, she was awarded the title of Professor Emeritus Education. She went on to earn a Master of Social Work degree in 1949 from New York’s Columbia University and a Doc-torate in Education from the University of Mas-sachusetts at Amherst in 1982 where she was awarded the prestigious title of Professor Emeritus of Education for her teachings. 
Clem vividly strived for honesty and under-
standing. She made it her duty to present oth-ers with the awareness she obtained. Her tire-less effort to engage, enjoy, and educate peo-ple touched the hearts of every person she met. A woman ahead of her time, Clemente Pugh tackled the many realms of ‘‘isms’’ in-
cluding, racism, sexism and classism. Her life was devoted to acknowledging and improving how these infected opinions affect African American people. With her remarkable resil-ience, I am proud to have called Clemente and her husband, Douglas Pugh, my dear and very special friends. I know that her legacy will live on for many years to come. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my distin-
guished colleagues join me as we pay tribute to such a treasure to our community. I pledge to continue to carry out her tradition of pro-voking thought and feeling for all who have lost their way, or simply need to be reminded of who we are, what we come from, and how we can overcome any obstacle presented be-fore us.
