IN HONOR OF 115TH CONGRESS HOUSE COMMITTEE ON APPRO-PRIATIONS 
HON. RODNEY P. FRELINGHUYSEN 
OF NEW JERSEY  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, December 27, 2018 Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, for the past two years, it has been my immense honor to serve as Chairman of the House Committee on Appropriations. This esteemed committee is charged with the ‘‘power of the purse’’ under the Constitu-tion, and I did not take this responsibility light-ly. In leading this committee, I had a singular focus on ‘‘getting our work done.’’ I am proud to say that in Fiscal Year 2019, we achieved something that hasn’t been done in over two decades—passing five Appropria-tions bills ahead of the end of the fiscal year. This is not a remarkable feat nor one that deserves applause. But it is historic, and it sig-nifies that we were able to do what the Amer-ican people sent us here to do: govern re-sponsibly. This was a critical step in returning to the regular federal funding process. These bills, which fund 75 percent of the federal government, included full funding for the Department of Defense and critical na-tional security programs. My deepest devotion has always been to our men and women in uniform, all volun-teers—to ensure they have the resources they need to fight and succeed in our missions. For their service and sacrifice, they must know they have the full support of the government behind them. I am proud to say we achieved that, providing stability and predictability where there had been none for many years. And we were able to provide historic levels of funding for the care of our veterans who have served our nation. Prior to this year, we laid the groundwork for this relative success. In Fiscal Year 2018, we passed all 12 bills in record time through ‘‘reg-ular order,’’ and three Disaster Supplemental Appropriations bills, historic in scope, to help our fellow citizens in their times of need. It is the duty of Congress to help commu-nities and families recover in times of great tragedy and emergencies, and the Appropria-tions Committee was consistently able to re-spond quickly and get resources into the hands of many communities, states, and re-gions of our nation. We achieved this all through an open and transparent process. Over the past two years, we held 160 oversight and budget hearings, received and considered tens of thousands of requests from members, and brought many bills to the floor under an open amendment process. Of this, the committee should be very proud. One of the hallmarks of the committee is the collegiality and bipartisan spirit in which our members work. Although we did not agree on everything, we all have great respect for the committee and our Constitutional duty to fund the government. Working in this manner best serves our districts, our states, and our coun-try. I owe a debt of gratitude to my colleagues on the Committee, especially the Sub-committee Chairs and Ranking Members, for their work over the past two years. They have fought ferociously for their priorities, and their intentions have always been to make this na-tion a better place to live and work: The Ranking Member of the full committee and the State and Foreign Operations Sub-committee, and incoming Chairwoman, Mrs. L
OWEY of New York. The Chairwoman of the Defense Sub-committee and incoming full committee Rank-ing Member, Ms. G

IAZ-BALART of Florida, and The Ranking Member of the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Sub-committee, Mr. P
RICE of North Carolina. And the 27 other members who served the House Appropriations Committee in the 115th Congress with honor and dedication. The committee would not have achieved all we did without the work of our faithful staff. These men and women spent countless hours—sacrificing time with their families, in-cluding holidays—preparing for many public hearings and shepherding our legislation to the House floor and to passage. I cannot thank them enough for their time, energy, and professional expertise: FROM OUR FRONT OFFICE

I thank my col-leagues for placing their confidence in me as Chairman of the Appropriations Committee. I thank my personal office staff in Morristown, NJ, and Washington, D.C., and most impor-tantly, I thank my constituents and my home state for the honor of a lifetime serving as the Representative from New Jersey’s 11th Con-gressional District.
