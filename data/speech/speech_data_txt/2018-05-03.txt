HONORING JULIE M CCLURE 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 3, 2018 Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Julie McClure’s advocacy for community and after-school programs, in particular her leadership at CalSERVES, and I join CaliforniaVolunteers in recognizing the im-portant work she has done. Ms. McClure is currently the Associate Su-perintendent at the Napa County Office of Education. For more than two decades, she has been a champion for the values AmeriCorps and national service can bring to a community. Ms. McClure has been essential to the success of AmeriCorps in California as a mentor to new programs and as a board member of Voices for California. In 1998 Ms. McClure started the CalSERVES tutoring program, in partnership with CaliforniaVolunteers and the Corporation for National and Community Service. She launched CalSERVES so students at Napa County Office of Education schools would have tutoring support. CalSERVES has been a model for community and after school pro-gramming and is known for its innovative use of AmeriCorps resources. More than 4,600 members have served 6.7 million hours in the community due in no small part to Ms. McClure’s efforts. In 2009 Ms. McClure started the CalSERVES Volunteer Infrastructure Pro-gram in order to expand CalSERVES’ out-reach and services. Currently, 60 AmeriCorps members provide programming in Napa and Sonoma County schools and 140 Corps mem-bers work on building volunteer capacity at other organizations throughout California. In addition to her work with CalSERVES and AmeriCorps, Ms. McClure’s advocacy work has included leading the California After School Demonstration Program and Healthy Behavior Learning Center. Mr. Speaker, Julie McClure has been a key contributor to the AmeriCorps experience in California for the last two decades and a tire-less advocate for public service. Therefore, it is fitting and proper that we honor her here today.

CONGRATULATING DR. PAUL OLSEN ON HIS RETIREMENT 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 3, 2018 Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Dr. Paul Olsen, who is retiring from Augustana College. Dr. Olsen has become a pillar in the Rock Island community, and he will be greatly missed. Dr. Olsen has spent 50 plus years coaching cross country and track and field at Augustana College. He has coached a total of 234 NCAA Division III All-American runners and, 26 times, these athletes have been crowned na-tional champions. Dr. Olsen was inducted into the Illinois Track and Field Coaches Associa-tion ‘‘Hall of Fame’’ in 2004 and went into the Augustana ‘‘Tribe of Vikings Hall of Fame’’ in 2006. Dr. Olsen is a professor in the English Department at Augustana, and is one of the most popular teachers in the entire school. It is because of dedicated and selfless lead-ers such as Dr. Paul Olsen that I am espe-cially proud to serve Illinois’ 17th Congres-sional District. Mr. Speaker, I would like to again formally congratulate Dr. Paul Olsen on his well-earned retirement, and thank him for all of his contributions and service to our com-munity. f 
IN HONOR OF LUPUS AWARENESS MONTH 2018 
HON. ANN M. KUSTER 
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 3, 2018 Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Lupus Awareness Month. An autoimmune disease, Lupus impacts more than one million Ameri-cans and many in communities across our Granite State. Those living with Lupus often experience significant symptoms such as fa-tigue, cognitive issues and physical chal-lenges. While Lupus affects millions of individuals worldwide and there are 16,000 new diag-noses each year, two-thirds of Americans are unaware of it. Through Lupus Awareness Month each May, advocates will ‘‘Go purple for Lupus’’ with local and national events to encourage understanding, research and sup-port of the disease. I will continue to champion and support public health efforts in Congress. I encourage my colleagues to honor individ-uals living with Lupus through annual aware-ness programming each May and throughout the year.

CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF SISTER KATHLEEN HEALY 
HON. NANCY PELOSI 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 3, 2018 Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Sister Kathleen Healy, who passed away on April 21, 2018 at the Sisters of the Presentation Motherhouse in San Fran-cisco. Sister Kathleen was a woman of great faith, and lived her faith by performing works of loving service to all of those in need. She was a great source of spiritual inspiration for me, my family and our community. A native San Franciscan, Sister Kathleen was born into a loving Irish family who instilled in her their strong Catholic Faith and commit-ment to social justice. As a Sister of the Pres-entation for seventy-five years, Sister Kathleen was a compassionate champion for immigrant rights, and a voice of conscience for alle-viating poverty and suffering in our immigrant communities, particularly among those who are elderly and disabled. Sister Kathleen was a founding member of The Lantern, a ministry project serving the im-migrant community of San Francisco through hospitality, education and advocacy. In 1974, she began her ministry with Saint Teresa of Avila Catholic Church in San Francisco where she served for over 30 years. In 2006, working with Saint Anthony Foundation, she visited the poor in residential hotels in the Tenderloin and provided social services in the Dining Room, where my family and I volunteer every year during Thanksgiving. In 1946, Sister Kathleen began 28 years as a Catholic school teacher in San Francisco, San Jose and Los Angeles, and served as principal at Saint Agnes School in San Fran-cisco from 1962–1968. Sister Kathleen served with Father Peter Sammon, Director of Family Life for the Arch-diocese of San Francisco, from 1979 to 1983. During this time, she became one of the origi-nal organizers of the Sanctuary Movement, founding the San Francisco Organizing Project and joining several delegations to El Salvador and Guatemala to support their peoples’ strug-gle for justice. Sister Kathleen prepared for her ministry by earning a Bachelor’s and a Master’s Degree in Education through the University of San Fran-cisco, a Master’s Degree in Theology through Immaculate Heart College in Los Angeles, and a Doctorate in Ministry from the Jesuit School of Theology in Berkeley. Sister Kathleen’s life was a blessing. She was predeceased by her parents, William and Hanna Healy, and her devoted sisters, Sister Nancy Healy, Sister Doreen Healy, Sister Maryann Healy, and Mrs. Honora Lowe. She is survived her beloved nieces, nephews, and cousins along with their families. May it be a comfort to her family and her loving Presen-tation Sisters that so many share in their grief at the loss of this remarkable saintly woman. f 
REMEMBERING JANICE CORBETT 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 3, 2018 Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of Janice Corbett, a fix-ture of the UC Davis community who will truly be missed. Janice was the living embodiment of Aggie Pride. She graduated from UC Davis in 1994, having been an active member of the campus community from the moment she arrived as a freshman. From serving on the Picnic Day Board and the Dean’s Student Advisory Com-mittee to working for the student government,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD —Extensions of RemarksE582 May 3, 2018 
ASUCD, she was truly committed to her fellow students. Janice’s commitment did not end there, however. In 2003, she began working for the Cal Aggie Alumni Association, helping to con-nect alumni of her beloved alma mater across the country and the world. In 2013, she got her dream job: ASUCD Business Officer. It was a role that she saw as the center of ev-erything UC Davis, and she was a champion for students in that role, bringing her incredible passion for mentoring students to the heart of her work. Across campus and the entire Davis com-munity, she was seen as a great colleague, but an even better friend, affectionately known as ‘‘Mama Warrior’’ during her battle with can-cer. Her Aggie spirit was always evident, but perhaps more important was the example she set, inspiring countless others to live a life in service others. Janice loved her family, including her hus-band, Larry, and sons, Anthony and Dominic, as well as her many dear friends. I know that they, along with the entire UC Davis commu-nity, join me in celebrating her memory.

HONORING BINLEY FLORIST AND GARDEN CENTER ON ITS 125TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 3, 2018 Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and recognize Binley Florist and Garden Center on its 125th anniversary. In 1893, an English immigrant named Arthur Binley bought a small piece of land on Grant Avenue in Glens Falls, New York. He opened up one greenhouse with a retail shop inside that sold flowers and vegetables to the com-munity. In 1930, Binley’s son, also named Ar-thur Binley, took over the company and was soon after joined by Alexander Hirsch, an im-migrant from Hungary. Hirsch attended horti-culture college in Budapest and was eager to put his talents to use in the United States. To-gether, they turned Binley’s into a thriving business. After an impressive 125 years in business, Binley Florist and Garden Center remains a staple in the local community, providing flow-ers for everything from proms to weddings. After so many years, Binley’s is still owned by the Hirsch family. Alexander’s son Wally Hirsch, continues his father’s legacy with the help of his wife, Kate, and their son, Jeff. On behalf of New York’s 21st District, I want to congratulate Binley Florist and Garden Cen-ter on its 125th anniversary. Binley’s has played an important role in Warren County community life, and I look forward to watching Binley’s continue to thrive in the years to come. IN RECOGNITION OF LUKE BEACH ON HIS OFFER OF APPOINTMENT TO ATTEND THE UNITED STATES MILITARY ACADEMY HON. ROBERT E. LATTA 
OF OHIO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 3, 2018 Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, it is my great pleasure to pay special tribute to an out-standing student from Ohio’s Fifth Congres-sional District. I am pleased to announce that Luke Beach of Haskins, Ohio has been of-fered an appointment to the United States Mili-tary Academy in West Point, New York. Luke’s offer of appointment permits him to attend the United States Military Academy this fall with the incoming Class of 2022. Attending one of our nation’s military academies not only offers the opportunity to serve our country, but also guarantees a world-class education while undertaking one of the most challenging and rewarding experiences of their lives. Luke brings a tremendous amount of leader-ship, service, and dedication to the incoming Class of 2022. While attending Otsego High School in Tontogany, Ohio, Luke was a mem-ber of the National Honor Society, Future Farmers of America, and the high school de-bate team. Throughout high school, Luke served as captain of both the varsity basketball and var-sity golf teams. Luke also ran his own busi-ness, Beach Lawn Care, volunteered with Honor Flight of Northwest Ohio and volun-teered at Otsego youth sports camp. I am confident that Luke will carry the lessons of his student and athletic leadership to the Mili-tary Academy. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Luke Beach on his offer of appointment to the United States Military Academy. Our service academies offer the fin-est military training and education available. I am positive that Luke will excel during his ca-reer at West Point, and I ask my colleagues to join me in extending their best wishes to him as he begins his service to our Nation.

RECOGNIZING ALLYSON MALLORY 
HON. MIKE COFFMAN 
OF COLORADO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 3, 2018 Mr. COFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the significant accomplishments of Allyson Mallory who is being honored at the First Annual Women Who Soar Awards by the Chamber of Commerce in Highlands Ranch, Colorado. Ms. Mallory has worked in elemen-tary, education for many years, but her ac-complishments and inspiration for people ex-tend well beyond the classroom. Allyson Mallory, who is currently the prin-cipal of Ralph Moody Elementary in Littleton, Colorado, was paralyzed from the waist down in a snowboarding accident this past Decem-ber. Five months later, she has just returned to work as principal, and is determined to someday walk again. The amount of strength, determination, and courage that Allyson has shown is truly in an inspiration to us all. She is an amazing role model to the children at her school and our entire community. It is truly an honor to rise today to recognize Allyson Mallory, and I am proud to congratu-late her on her recovery. Allyson has the for-titude and resilience to accomplish any goal she sets for herself, and I look forward to see-ing her work and spirit grow in the future. f 
IN RECOGNITION OF DEPUTY CHIEF OF POLICE BETTY MILLER STOCKS RECEIVING THE ROBERT JACKSON EURY MEMORIAL AWARD 
HON. RICHARD HUDSON 
OF NORTH CAROLINA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 3, 2018 Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Concord Deputy Chief of Police Betty Miller Stocks for receiving the Robert Jackson Eury Memorial Award. Deputy Chief Stocks has now become the first African American re-cipient of this award. A native of Concord, North Carolina, Deputy Chief Stocks has served with the Concord Po-lice Department in North Carolina’s 8th Con-gressional District for 27 years. Education was of the utmost importance to Deputy Chief Stocks, graduating from Concord High School before earning an Associate’s Degree in Criminal Justice from Rowan-Cabarrus Com-munity College, a Bachelor’s Degree in Crimi-nal Justice from Barber-Scotia College and a Master’s Degree in Public Administration from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. Throughout her career, Deputy Chief Stocks has served as a Patrol Officer, Sergeant, Cap-tain, and now Deputy Chief of Police. Deputy Chief Stock’s outstanding leadership and com-mitment in these roles for the Concord Police Department made her stand out in our com-munity. The Robert Jackson Eury Memorial Award is presented in memory of Robert Jackson Eury, a man who lost his life in the line of duty while serving as a Cabarrus County law en-forcement officer. This award keeps Mr. Eury’s legacy alive through officers who share his same admirable and commendable spirit in Cabarrus County. Based on her career of service, I would say Deputy Chief Stocks fits the mold of esteemed law enforcement offi-cers in our community set by Robert Eury. There is no doubt in my mind that Deputy Chief Stocks will continue her outstanding leadership and maintain her unwavering val-ues while protecting the people of Cabarrus County; I am excited to see what the future holds for such a dedicated law enforcement professional. Mr. Speaker, please join me today in con-gratulating Deputy Chief of Police Betty Miller Stocks for receiving the Robert Jackson Eury Memorial Award. We all wish her well as she continues to make a positive impact on our community.

HONORING AND RECOGNIZING THE MAINE STATE ELKS ASSOCIA-TION IN CELEBRATION OF THE ELKS 150 YEARS OF SERVICE 
HON. BRUCE POLIQUIN 
OF MAINE  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 3, 2018 Mr. POLIQUIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 150th Anniversary of the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks of the United States of America. The Maine Elks Association is a strong, community-minded, and patriotic organization that supports our veterans and local commu-nities in various ways. Since the Elks incorporation in 1868, it has become one of America’s oldest and largest fraternal organizations in the country. Its mem-bers have proved to be strong Americans, leaving a legacy of youth-oriented, charitable, and community service programs that are all encompassing. Today, the legacy of the BPO Elks and other honorable citizens thrives in Maine under current Maine State President, David Anderson. The Maine State Elks Association is celebrating their fundraising efforts for the Maine State Elks project, Maine Children’s Cancer Program, and the fact that they have raised over $4 million to date for the children of Maine. We are so proud to have Elk members in the heart of our Great State of Maine, and I am honored to serve in the United States Congress on behalf of its members. As we celebrate the Elks, we look forward to many more years of tradition and community projects. Mr. Speaker and distinguished colleagues, please join me in recognizing the 150th Anni-versary of the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks, and wishing its members the very best in the years to come.

HONORING DARIOUSH AND SHAHPAR KHALEDI 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 3, 2018 Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Darioush and Shahpar Khaledi for their leadership in raising the role of arts and culture in California’s Napa Valley. Mr. and Ms. Khaledi have made many con-tributions to our community, particularly through their steadfast commitment to the arts. Mr. Khaledi was born and raised in Iran, where his fascination with wine began at an early age, due to his father’s winemaking and the cultural history of winemaking of Shiraz, Iran. After building what was at one point the largest family-owned grocery business in Cali-fornia, Mr. and Ms. Khaledi founded Darioush Winery in 1997. Mr. Khaledi considers Darioush Winery to be the realization of his American Dream. His goal was to produce wines that celebrate both individualism and craftsmanship. For Ms. Khaledi it was essen-tial that clients and guests be treated as fam-ily, which she considers to be more than a cul-tural tradition, but a way of life. Her welcoming philosophy has defined the Darioush experi-ence and is derived from Tarof, the Persian art of social etiquette—in essence how to make your guests feel more at home ‘‘than home itself.’’ In addition to running their world-class win-ery, Mr. and Ms. Khaledi are active patrons of the arts and engaged community members. Mr. Khaledi is the Founding Chair on the Board of Directors for Festival Napa Valley, an organization that puts on an annual performing arts festival and also offers year-round pro-gramming. Mr. Khaledi is also a Board Mem-ber for organizations including Napa Valley Vintners, the Los Angeles Philharmonic, Food Marketing Institute, Unified Grocers and the St. Helena Hospital Foundation. Mr. Speaker, Mr. and Ms. Khaledi are the kind of community members we should all strive to emulate. Their dedication to the arts in the Napa Valley has been crucial for the growth of our arts community. It is therefore fitting and proper that we honor Darioush and Shahpar Khaledi here today. f 
HONORING THE LIFE AND MEM-ORY OF COLIN HAYWARD TOLAND 
HON. TOM REED 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 3, 2018 Mr. REED. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of a courageous young man, Colin Hayward Toland, who lost his bat-tle with brain cancer on Saturday, March 17, 2018 at the age of ten. Officer Colin had served as an honorary member of the Ithaca Police Department since September 12, 2016, becoming the youngest member of the police force. On March 8, 2018, Officer Colin was promoted from Ser-geant to Lieutenant and assigned to the tac-tical unit by the Memphis Police Department. During his time on the force, Lieutenant Colin showed resilience and determination to keep his community safe, making him the per-fect candidate to investigate and arrest The Grinch who was trying to steal Christmas from his community in December 2016. Lieutenant Colin’s courage in the arrest set forth an ex-ample to his brothers on the police force. I ask my colleagues to join me in remem-bering Lieutenant Colin Hayward Toland and his exemplary service to the Ithaca Police De-partment and ensuring his family and commu-nity that he leaves behind that our thoughts and prayers are with them.

RECOGNIZING THE 113TH ANNIVER-SARY OF THE PENNSYLVANIA STATE POLICE 
HON. LOU BARLETTA 
OF PENNSYLVANIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 3, 2018 Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, it is a great honor for me to join the brave men and women of Troop N, headquartered in my hometown of Hazleton, Pennsylvania, in rec-ognizing the 113th anniversary of the Pennsyl-vania State Police. Created by an act of legislation signed into law by Governor Samuel Pennypacker on May 2, 1905, the Pennsylvania State Police was the first uniformed police organization of its kind in the country. During the Great Anthra-cite Strike of 1902, violence disrupted the peace and safety of seven counties, causing a nationwide coal shortage that forced President Teddy Roosevelt to intervene. In the aftermath of strike, it was decided that peace and order should be maintained by responsible officers employed by the public. The State Police quickly became vital in Pennsylvania, controlling mob violence, patrol-ling farms, protecting wildlife, and tracking down criminals, and later served as a model for other police forces across the country. Originally limited to 228 men, the Pennsyl-vania State Police Department now includes nearly 5,000 sworn officers and 2,000 civilian members, and is dedicated to criminal inves-tigations, traffic enforcement, and other public safety services across the Commonwealth. These brave men and women put their lives on the line each and every day to keep our families and communities safe. This risk is not without sacrifice. Since its founding, 98 offi-cers have died in the line of duty while serving the Pennsylvania State Police. Let us take a moment to honor them, and to thank them for their sacrifice to maintain the safety of our communities. As we reflect on the past 113 years of this police force, and honor those who made the ultimate sacrifice in its service, I also want to thank the selfless and courageous officers who are currently serving. With National Police Week fast approaching, it is only right that we recognize all that our nation’s law enforcement officers do to keep us safe. The protection they provide is something no one should take for granted, and I am forever grateful for their service. Mr. Speaker, please join me in recognizing the 113th anniversary of the Pennsylvania State Police. f

RECOGNIZING MR. THOMAS ANDERS, MISS REBEKAH STEELMAN AND MR. BLAKE REEVES 
HON. STEVE STIVERS 
OF OHIO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 3, 2018 Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the people of Ohio’s 15th Congres-sional District to recognize the hard work and success of Mr. Thomas Anders, Miss Rebekah Steelman, and Mr. Blake Reeves. These three young people recently represented Lancaster High School and our community in a statewide competition hosted by the Family, Career and Community Leaders of America (FCCLA). Their dedication and skill earned them first place in Entrepreneurship and the opportunity to compete in the national competition this June. Mr. Anders, Miss Steelman, and Mr. Reeves displayed impressive planning and design ca-pabilities in their project: developing a new restaurant. From the floor plan and the menu, to licensing and local laws, no detail was over-looked. Couple their meticulous planning with their vision and creativity, and it is easy to see how they surpassed their competitors. The success of these students showcases the importance of ensuring all students have access to enriching educational experiences that maximize individual achievement and po-tential. I want to thank Mr. Anders, Miss Steelman, and Mr. Reeves, as well as all those involved in FCCLA, for demonstrating the value in bridging the gap between school and the workforce. In addition to their prize and the opportunity to compete against students from across the nation, Mr. Anders, Miss Steelman, and Mr. Reeves have each been awarded a scholar-ship towards their studies at Sullivan Univer-sity in the fall. I am confident that their entre-preneurial skills will be put to good use in all future endeavors, and I look forward to seeing all that they accomplish. I am honored to represent such young, hardworking, and zealous students in the U.S. House of Representatives. I ask my col-leagues to join me in congratulating Mr. Thom-as Anders, Miss Rebekah Steelman, and Mr. Blake Reeves, and wishing them the best of luck in their upcoming competition. RECOGNIZING THE 100TH BIRTH-DAY OF TRESSIE ELIZABETH BUTT HUMPHREY HON. JASON SMITH 
OF MISSOURI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 3, 2018 Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the remarkable 100th birthday of Tressie Elizabeth Butt Humphrey.

A 1936 graduate of Steelville High School, she married the late Luther Theodore Hum-phrey with whom she shares two children, Lo-retta Mae and Selma Jean, as well as six grandchildren, eighteen great-grandchildren, and nineteen great-great-grandchildren. Tressie is a former teacher of the Slowensky one-room school house, a lifetime member of the Order of the Eastern Star of Missouri, and the owner of a Missouri Century Farm. Tressie has achieved a great milestone in her life by celebrating her 100th birthday. She is a woman of character and is greatly be-loved by all who know her. She has displayed exceptional leadership, contributing greatly to our society throughout her years. For all of these reasons and many more, it is my pleas-ure to recognize Tressie before the United States House of Representatives.

HON. ILEANA ROS-LEHTINEN 
OF FLORIDA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 3, 2018 Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate Director Kern Carpenter of the Miami-Dade County Farm Bureau, on his induction to the Farm Bureau Hall of Honor. A third generation farmer with a rich history in tomato production; Mr. Carpenter and his family have dedicated their lives to preserving the beauty and prestige of Florida’s agri-culture. At a young age, Kern lost his father to can-cer and not long after; the farm he loved. However, Kern never lost sight of his family’s heritage and worked hard to one day run his very own farm. In 1983, Kern successfully renewed his fam-ily’s farming legacy and opened Kern Car-penter Farms. Today, that passion and drive Kern pos-sessed at such a young age, continues to im-pact so many farmers and serves as an inspi-ration throughout our South Florida commu-nity. Mr. Speaker, it is individuals like Kern that encompass the American spirit we all hold so dear. I wish him the very best in his future en-deavors, and congratulate him on this much deserved honor.
