PRESIDENTIAL ALLOWANCE MOD-ERNIZATION ACT OF 2016—VETO MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (H. DOC. NO. 114–155) The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-fore the House the following veto mes-sage from the President of the United States: To the House of Representatives: I am returning herewith without my approval H.R. 1777, the ‘‘Presidential Allowance Modernization Act of 2016,’’ which would amend the Former Presi-dents Act of 1958. I agree with H.R. 1777’s goal of re-forming the pensions and allowances provided to former Presidents so as to reduce unnecessary costs to taxpayers. But if implemented as drafted, the bill would have unintended consequences. It would impose onerous and unreason-able burdens on the offices of former Presidents, including by requiring the General Services Administration to immediately terminate salaries and benefits of office employees and to re-move furnishings and equipment from offices. It would withdraw the General Services Administration’s ability to administer leases and negatively im-pact operations, with unanticipated implications for the protection and se-curity of former Presidents. My Administration will work with the authors of the bill and other lead-ers in the Congress, in consultation with the offices of former Presidents, to explore the best ways to achieve these goals going forward. If the Con-gress returns the bill having appro-priately addressed these concerns, I will sign it. For now, I must veto the bill. B
ARACK OBAMA .T
HEWHITE HOUSE , July 22, 2016. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The ob-jections of the President will be spread at large upon the Journal, and the veto message and the bill will be printed as a House document. Without objection, further consider-ation of the veto message and the bill, H.R. 1777, is postponed until the legis-lative day of September 23, 2016. There was no objection.

HONORING THE SISTERS OF THE HOLY FAMILY 
HON. CEDRIC L. RICHMOND 
OF LOUISIANA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, July 25, 2016 Mr. RICHMOND. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Sisters of the Holy Family, the only religious order founded in New Orleans that still exists today. The Sisters of the Holy Family were found-ed in 1842 by Henriette Delille, a free woman of color. Sisters of the Holy Family defied the norms of the time and chose to live a chaste life dedicated to God. In a time where white communities were not accepting of black com-munities and laws forbade blacks from living with white; there was much need for a set of church and civil authorities to give the people a place to call home in the midst of so much racial aggression. In memory of Henriette, the fearless and gracious leader of the Sisters of the Holy Family, St. Mary’s Academy the first sec-ondary school for free girls of color was found-ed in New Orleans. Today the school edu-cates co-ed students from grades pre-kinder-garten to fifth grade while only girls are edu-cated from sixth through twelfth grade. St. Mary’s Academy graduates have become prominent professionals across the U.S. For over 174 years, The Sisters of the Holy Family have continued their mission of edu-cating the youth, caring for the sick and elder-ly, amongst many other dutiful deeds. The sis-ters have been recognized by civil and church authorities for their dedicated services to the people of God. By staying connected to God’s transformational love as well as ensuring the continued growth of St. Mary’s Academy. The Sisters will live in the hearts of hundreds for years to come. Mr. Speaker, I celebrate the courage, com-mitment and sacrifice that the Sisters of the Holy Family have shown for over 174 years.

IN RECOGNITION OF LOUDOUN INTERFAITH RELIEFS 25TH ANNI-VERSARY 
HON. BARBARA COMSTOCK 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, July 25, 2016 Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to ac-knowledge the 25th anniversary of Loudoun Interfaith Relief and their steadfast service to the good citizens of the Loudoun community. I would like to personally commend the volun-teers who so selflessly dedicate themselves to providing support to those less fortunate with-out asking anything in return. These notable citizens truly embody the very best of our na-tion’s values through their service to the com-munity and commitment to the betterment of others’ lives. Loudoun Interfaith Relief has increased their service exponentially since forming in 1991, growing into the largest food pantry in Loudoun County. From 2013 to 2014 alone, the total assistance rose from 40,959 to 52,955 and continues to grow regularly. The pantry is open six days a week and has over 320 volunteers working daily to help provide services to those in need. This growth is a clear testament to the outstanding dedication to service conducted by the staff and volun-teers at Loudoun Interfaith Relief. Mr. Speaker, it brings me immense pride to recognize such a fine group, and I sincerely hope that we all can live up to their tremen-dous example. I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Loudoun Interfaith Relief. I wish them all the best and hope that they con-tinue to be a positive example of service to the community. f 
HONORING WILLIAM PATTERSON 
HON. BARBARA LEE 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, July 25, 2016 Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the extraordinary career and lifetime of leader-ship of Mr. William Patterson as he receives a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Boys Scouts of America—San Francisco Bay Area Council. Mr. Patterson’s dedication and con-tributions to the San Francisco Bay Area have aided in the success and advancement of thousands of people and he is widely recog-nized as one of Oakland’s civic champions due to his involvement in many political cam-paigns and community organizations in the last four decades. Mr. Patterson first learned to help others at all times when he became a Boy Scout in 1948. As a Scout, Mr. Patterson learned the values of Scout Law that would ultimately guide his life of service. Further, Mr. Patterson received both his Bachelor’s and Master’s de-grees from San Francisco State University. Mr. Patterson went on to serve as the Presi-dent of The East Bay Municipal Utility District’s (EBMUD) Board of Directors and left a lasting impact. Mr. Patterson was able to significantly expand the retirement fund assets. He is also a retired Oakland Parks and Recreation Man-ager, who has been credited widely by many established athletes who have gone on to gain Hall of Fame Recognition, including the likes of basketball’s Bill Russell an baseball’s Joe Morgan. In addition, Mr. Patterson was a close confidant and advisor to the late Oakland Mayor Lionel Wilson and worked for the Oak-land Parks and Recreation Commission for thirty seven years until his retirement. He is the only former employee to serve as a mem-ber of the Oakland Parks and Recreation Commission, displaying his exceptional dedi-cation to the greater Oakland community. Mr. Patterson has an extensive and impres-sive background of involvement in the commu-nity. Mr. Patterson was a three-term president of the Oakland chapter of the National Asso-ciation for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), a seven-year past chair for the NAACP Life Membership Committee and eight year member of the NAACP National Life Membership Committee. He served as Chair of The Alameda County Juvenile Delinquency Prevention Committee and Chair of its Public Ethics and Parks and Recreation Commission, the Workforce Investment Board, and Pardee Museum Board. In addition to his impressive and extensive career, he has received countless awards in recognition of his accomplishments from gov-ernment, community and political organiza-tions. Some of the most honorable awards in-cludes: California Attorney General’s Award of Excellence in Civil Rights, City of Oakland Liv-ing Legends Award, the naming of Bill Patter-son Park, African American Water Leadership Coalition (AAWLC) Legacy Award, Paul Law-rence Dunbar High School Legacy Award, McClymonds High School Legacy Award, and Shiloh Church of Oakland Living Legacy Award. Mr. Patterson currently lives in Oakland, California with his wife and son; he remains active in numerous community activities. Cur-rently, he serves as a Board Member of The Joe Morgan Youth, Oakland Urban Strategies Council, Oakland NAACP Executive Com-mittee, the Oakland East Bay Black Elected Officials Council and as an advisor to Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf. Mr. Patterson is a mem-ber of Oakland’s Rotary Club #3, Golden Her-itage Life Member of NAACP, and a member of Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity. On a personal note, Bill has been a sup-porter and colleague for many years. I value his expertise, his brilliance, and most impor-tantly, his friendship. Today, California’s 13th Congressional Dis-trict salutes and honors a great friend of the Bay Area and a true champion of civil service, Mr. William Patterson. His work with the NAACP, EBMUD, Oakland’s Parks and Recre-ation and embodiment of Scout Law has had a tremendously positive impact on California’s 13th District, and we are lucky to have him re-main active in our community in all of his fu-ture endeavors.

OF COLORADO

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, July 25, 2016 Mrs. COMSTOCK.

This is a clear testament to the outstanding work which is conducted by this caring family and they are deserving of recognition. Mr. Speaker, it brings me immense pride to recognize such a fine group, and I sincerely hope that we all can live up to their tremen-dous example. I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the Mars family and their business. I wish them continued success and hope that they remain a strong positive pres-ence in our community for years to come.

HONORING MRS. IMOGENE BURRIS 
HON. BARBARA LEE 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, July 25, 2016 Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the extraordinary life of Mrs. Imogene Burris. With her passing May 27, 2016, we honor her brilliant social justice work. Much of Mrs. Burris’ life was spent improv-ing the lives of those less fortunate both in her personal and professional life. Mrs. Burris, for many years, was a business woman where she operated Summerside Homes, Vallejo, fa-cilities for the developmentally disabled. She treated the clients as her own children and in-sisted that all employees treat the clients in the same manner. In addition to her impressive and important career with Summerside Homes, she was ac-tive in many community and business organi-zations including the National Council of Negro Women, Delta Sigma Theta, the Con-tinentals of Omega Boys and Girls Club of Vallejo. In her personal life, she had a tremendous wit and enjoyed dialogue on all kinds of sub-jects especially those involving current events and the status of the African American com-munity. She instilled in everyone around her the desire to lead a life that makes a dif-ference by improving the lives of those less fortunate than you. Mrs. Burris loved to travel to learn more about the world and interact with all sorts of experiences. Mrs. Burris is well remembered by her fam-ily and community as a stylish dresser and a hallmark was her grand and colorful hats. For many years she got a new hat for every Christmas, Easter, Mother’s Day and her birth-day. She had a hat for all occasions with matching purse, gloves and shoes. Mrs. Burris’ community will also miss the delectable soul food she cooked, especially her well re-garded peach cobbler. Mrs. Burris was married for 67 years to the late DeWitt Burris and they had 6 children, two of whom preceded her in death. She is sur-vived by a daughter Faye Anderson, a retired Middle School principal with San Francisco Unified School District, and two sons: Rev. Dr. Ronald Burris, an Associate Professor of church history at the American Baptist Semi-nary of the West and Pastor of Temple Baptist Church in Richmond, and John Burris, a law professor at North Carolina Central University School of Law. Mrs. Burris has a host of grandchildren, great grandchildren, great-great grandchildren, and several generations of nieces and nephews all whom adored her and are mourning her passing. She was the ‘‘grand dame’’ and Matriarch who took great pride in family, friends and the community at large. All who met her could feel her kindness and sincerity. Her motto was ‘‘If I can be help-ful, I will’’. Today, California’s 13th Congressional Dis-trict salutes the legacy of Mrs. Imogene Burris. Her contributions have truly impacted count-less lives through the Bay Area. I join all of Mrs. Burris’ loved ones in celebrating her in-credible life and offer my most sincere condo-lences. f 
IN RECOGNITION OF THE BANK OF CLARKE COUNTY 
HON. BARBARA COMSTOCK 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, July 25, 2016 Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I am hon-ored to recognize the Bank of Clarke County during its 135th anniversary year, and to con-gratulate all who have been affiliated with the bank and its holding company, Eagle Financial Services, Inc., for 135 years of successful op-eration of a nationally recognized community banking business that has provided excellent banking services for my constituents in the northern Shenandoah Valley and western Loudoun County. The Bank of Clarke County is steeped in a rich history. It was founded in 1881, fifteen years after the end of the Civil War, as the Bank of Berryville. Thereafter, through the tur-bulence and uncertainty of two world wars, a depression and several recessions, not to mention strong competition from larger banks, the challenges of the global economy, cyber- security threats and excessive government regulation, the able leadership of the Bank of Clarke County has guided the institution to steady growth and prosperity. The bank’s business has been so consistent that, since 1986, it has increased its dividend each year, and, for the fourth year in a row, American Banker magazine has named it one of the Top 200 Community Banks in the na-tion. The Bank of Clarke County has been an ex-traordinarily constructive member of the com-munities that it has served. In addition to help-ing countless Virginians buy homes, start busi-nesses, and invest in the future, it has gener-ously contributed to a variety of worthy causes, including the Independence Day Fire-works at the Clarke County Fairgrounds and the classic car show in Leesburg, called Cruise-In, whose proceeds benefit the Tree of Life Ministries in western Loudoun County. Over the years, the bank has also made a huge difference to the quality of education of Clarke County students, making generous an-nual contributions to the Clarke County Edu-cation Foundation, including for the Jack Hardesty Memorial Scholarship which is named after a beloved former leader of Clarke County who was also a Director of the bank. It also funds the Bank of Clarke County En-dowed Scholarship, which is presented annu-ally to a Clarke County High School senior who will be attending Lord Fairfax Community College and majoring in business or a related field. In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, during its 135th anniversary, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Chairman of the Board Tom Gilpin, President and CEO Johnny Milleson and all the hard working employees of the Bank of Clarke County and Eagle Financial Services, Inc., for claiming a special place in the history of Clarke County and the Common-wealth of Virginia as one of the top community banks in the nation. f

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the tenure and accomplishments of a community leader, a recognized advocate for affordable housing, and a dedicated public servant. Tempe City Councilmember Corey Woods served the neighborhoods and families of Tempe with honor for eight years and stepped down last month to pursue new op-portunities. During his eight-year tenure on the Tempe City Council Mr. Woods focused on increasing affordable housing in Tempe, a growing and vibrant community in my district that encom-passes Arizona State University. Thanks in large part to Mr. Woods’ efforts Tempe has re-ceived over $2.3 million in funding specifically

for new and expanded affordable housing projects. I was proud to work with Mr. Woods and the entire Tempe City Council on other projects to increase the quality of life for Tempe resi-dents, such as the new Tempe Streetcar project and the Valley Metro Light Rail. I be-lieve Tempe will be better off for generations to come thanks to Mr. Woods’ leadership and vision. I look forward to many more great accom-plishments from Mr. Woods through his role as the Chief Operating Officer at the Greater Phoenix Urban League and through his work in the community. I thank him for his extraor-dinary service to Tempe and look forward to working with him in the future.

HONORING MR. JUNIOUS WILLIAMS 
HON. BARBARA LEE 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, July 25, 2016 Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the extraordinary career of Mr. Junious Wil-liams, who is retiring from the position of Chief Executive Officer of the Urban Strategies Council after more than twenty years of serv-ice. Mr. Williams has an impressive education background, holding a Juris Doctorate in Law, and a Bachelor’s degree in Sociology, from the University of Michigan. He began his legal career primarily as a champion of equal educational opportunity for minorities and inner city youth. In addition to private law practice, he has been an expert consultant in numerous school desegregation cases around the country. He founded the Saginaw (Michigan) Student Rights Center and was cofounder of the Ann Arbor Student Advocacy Center. Mr. Williams worked closely with a number of metropolitan school districts and parent groups on school desegregation issues, education equity and the administra-tion of fair student discipline for minority and underprivileged students. Most notably, Mr. Williams served as Associate Director of the Programs for Educational Opportunity at the University of Michigan’s School of Education. After moving to California, he served as an ally to resident-led base-building organizations on issues from developing small schools, to increasing site-based decision-making in Oak-land Unified School District (OUSD), to nego-tiation and implementation of community bene-fits agreements so that benefits of develop-ment are equitably distributed. Further, Mr. Williams played a key role in transforming Oakland’s public schools into hubs that ad-dress the needs of students and their families, beginning with his leadership of the movement for Village Centers and culminating in his ef-forts to help OUSD become one of the first Full-Service Community School districts in the nation. Mr. Williams has worked on numerous com-munity building and community development efforts in Oakland, the Bay Area and other cit-ies across the country. He currently serves as a founder and Board Chair for the Oakland Community Land Trust, which is working to acquire and rehabilitate vacant, foreclosed properties in Oakland and make these housing units available to low income buyers. He also serves as Co-Chair of the Steering Committee for the Oakland Emerald Cities Collaborative, a national nonprofit network of organizations working together to advance a sustainable environment while creating a high- road, clean-energy economy with opportunities for all. Other current board service includes the Union Bank Community Advisory Board, the Center for Law and Education, and the National Trust for the Development of African American Men. Furthermore, Mr. Williams joined the Urban Strategies Council in 1992 and was appointed CEO in 1998. He led the Council’s creation of, and participation in, many cross-sector col-laborations, making positive impact in areas from afterschool programs to violence preven-tion, from asset building to reentry. He also oversaw multiple Urban Strategies Council re-ports on African American male students that played a key role in Oakland Unified School District’s Voluntary Resolution Plan with the U.S. Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights. Today, California’s 13th Congressional Dis-trict salutes and honors a great friend of the Bay Area and a true champion for equity, Mr. Junious Williams. His work with the Urban Strategies Council has had a tremendously positive impact on California’s 13th District, and we are lucky to have him remain active in our community in all of his future endeavors.

IN HONOR OF THE LIFE OF MANUEL G. SEMPELES 
HON. BARBARA COMSTOCK 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, July 25, 2016 Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to ac-knowledge and remember the life of Manuel ‘‘Manny’’ Sempeles, a notable member of the Winchester community who sadly passed away in May of 2015. I knew Manny person-ally and can attest to his humor, his selfless nature, and his ability to light up every room into which he walked. Manny was born in 1931 in Winchester and following his edu-cation at Handley High School, he selflessly decided to serve his country and enlisted in the United States Military where he was post-ed to Germany between 1952 and 1954. It was during this time that he proved both his courage and his valor during the Korean War and was promoted to the rank of Private First Class as part of the 101st Airborne Division. Upon his return, he decided to complete his education at Virginia University and the Uni-versity of Richmond where he continued to nurture his passion for football. It was at this point Manny decided to shift from serving his country to serving his community. Mr. Sempeles led a distinguished career through his membership and eventual presi-dency of the local parish council. He further acted as a member for the Virgin Mary Greek Orthodox Church as well as serving on the Winchester Star Leadership Committee. Manny volunteered as a coach at James Wood and Handley High School so as to pass his passion for football onto others. His self-lessness is only too apparent through his ex-emplary contributions and participation in com-munity matters and I know his compassion will be sorely missed by all who knew him. Beyond his civil duties, Manny was a loving husband to his wife Florine with whom he shared a restaurant business, beginning with their first establishment ‘‘The Open Hearth’’. They celebrated over 57 years of loving mar-riage together. In addition to Florine, Manny leaves behind three daughters: Tina, Andrea and Stephanie, as well as two sons George and Michael, all of whom are now married with children of their own, and even grandchildren. Through them, I’m sure, his values and legacy will be assured. Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in honoring the life of Manuel Sempeles. f 
RECOGNIZING K–9 OFFICER ARON AND DEPUTY MATTHEW SLOAN 
HON. JOHN KATKO 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, July 25, 2016 Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize K–9 Officer Aron and his handler, Deputy Matthew Sloan, of the Cayuga County Sheriffs Department, for their valiant actions in quickly apprehending and securing a high risk suspect who fled police on June 9, 2016. The fleeing suspect had attempted to evade police, but thanks to K–9 Officer Aron’s fear-less and efficient actions, Deputy Sloan was able to apprehend the suspect, and no officers were hurt while working to stop the suspect. K–9 Officer Aron and Deputy Sloan deserve to be properly recognized for their heroic ac-tions and I am honored to pay tribute to them for their brave efforts that led to a safe ending of situation that could have quickly escalated. Each and every day K–9 Officer Aron and Deputy Sloan work tirelessly together to pro-tect our community and I am honored to rec-ognize their work. I would also like to recognize all K–9 Offi-cers and their handlers for the extraordinary work they do across the 24th District. K–9 Of-ficers approach every situation, no matter how dangerous with complete and total confidence and fearlessness to protect their human part-ners. K–9 Officers are an asset to all law en-forcement and I am proud to recognize them for their service.

HONORING JOHN ARTHUR IVEY 
HON. BARBARA LEE 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, July 25, 2016 Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the extraordinary life of an outstanding mem-ber of the East Bay community Mr. John Ar-thur Ivey. With his passing on June 21, 2016, we recognize his dedication and celebrate his commitment to our community. Mr. Ivey’s life is an example of a journey well traveled and a life well lived. He was born on March 10, 1950, in the heart of my con-gressional district, at Highland Hospital in Oakland. Mr. Ivey used his education as a gateway to the world. During his formative years he at-tended Skyline High School where his love of literature and art began to emerge. He began his journey in higher education at The Univer-sity of San Francisco where he pursued his in-terest in English and served as president of

the Black Student Union. He later transferred to Rutgers University, where he refined his writing skills under the guide of renowned playwrights and authors Nikki Giovanni and Sonya Sanchez. After earning his Bachelor of Arts in English from Rutgers University in 1972, he pursued a Master’s Degree in Fine Arts at the University of California, Los Ange-les. After graduation, his talent as a writer led him to compose two critically acclaimed plays ‘‘Homer’s Redemption’’ and ‘‘Resurgence,’’ which ran at the Harding Theater in San Fran-cisco for six months before touring college campuses. The University of San Francisco Black Alumni Association later awarded him an honorary degree in English and Theater Arts for his outstanding contributions. While his literary success is noteworthy, Mr. Ivey continued to evolve and use his talents to contribute to his community in new capacities. In 1976, he opened Ivey’s Ribs and Spirits in Jack London Square with brothers Fred and James ‘‘Jay’’ Ivey. Ivey’s was one of the first African American operated venues located in Jack London Square, and was the frequent gathering place for elected officials, commu-nity leaders, as well as local and national ce-lebrities. Mr. Ivey’s love of community, passion for art, and the amazing food he served gave way to the development of another Ivey’s in Atlanta, Georgia. Those two restaurants soon grew to nine restaurants and lounges including Bluesville, Cherie’s, Du Soleil’s, and Clancy’s. The environment he created welcomed artists from all mediums including the Commodores, Prince, Eartha Kitt, Jane Fonda, Phyllis Hyman, Stan Getz, Coretta Scott King, and James Baldwin. When Mr. Ivey retired from the restaurant business he began to partake in a new adven-ture. Mr. Ivey could be found cooking delicious meals, reading (and sharing his findings) vora-ciously, running Lake Merritt or traveling the globe. He combined passion for food, family, and writing, when he worked with his mother to publish Rosia Lee Ivey’s Recipes For Life in 2008. In this book, he wittily incorporated her words of wisdom with her phenomenal cul-inary knowledge. He also worked with numerous community organizations to mentor inner-city youth. His goal was to support and inspire the leaders of tomorrow. At the time of his passing, Mr. Ivey was actively working with Oakland Youth First, a nonprofit organization committed to pro-viding wraparound, career and educational services to at-risk youth. Mr. Ivey was also an avid traveler. He vis-ited Fiji as one of fifteen Bay Area Black Com-munity and Business Delegates, China as part of a trade mission, and Tunisia, Morocco, Ca-sablanca and Malaga among countless other destinations. No matter where his journey took him he always came back to the place where it all began, always ready to serve the com-munity he called home. On a personal note, to know John was to love John. His smile was infectious, his en-couragement was inspiring and his creativity was magical. John was a renaissance man, a man ahead of his time. As a role model for young African American men and boys, he gave them hope and pride. We will miss this magnificent human being, but his legacy will live forever. Today, California’s 13th Congressional Dis-trict salutes the legacy of Mr. John Arthur Ivey. His contributions have truly impacted count-less lives throughout the Bay Area and the country. I join all of Mr. Ivey’s loved ones in celebrating his incredible life and offer my most sincere condolences.

HONORING THE LIFE OF RICHARD ROTH 
HON. TED LIEU 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, July 25, 2016 Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr. Speaker, Richard Roth was a remarkable, kind and lov-ing man. He passed away peacefully with his son David, daughter-in-law Anita, and their girls at his side. Richard was a gentle and generous soul who loved politics, discussions, and laughter. But most of all, he loved his son, David. Richard strived throughout his very long life to encourage David to be the very best in everything he did. Richard was energetic and active well into his 80s; making frequent trips from California to the Fiji Islands to visit with David and Anita. He told fascinating, colorful tales of joining David, Anita and the King of Tonga at the Sydney Opera House for a special gala in honor of the King. In later years, Richard fol-lowed David and Anita to Florida, where he lived peacefully in a condo overlooking the At-lantic Ocean. David’s love for his father was unsurpassed. Last year, during Richard’s 95th year, David took his father on a private, personal trip to-gether to Israel. That trip had been one of Richard’s lifelong dreams, and he got to make the trip with his beloved son. Always bright, inquisitive and cheerful, Rich-ard enjoyed life to the fullest. His kindness to so many will not be forgotten by any who knew him.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, July 25, 2016 Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to ac-knowledge the Children’s Emergency Room at Inova Loudoun Hospital for serving my con-stituents so meticulously every day. The work done by the doctors and nurses at this facility has led to them being recognized by the Emergency Nurses Association with the pres-entation of the prestigious Lantern Award. Named in honor of Florence Nightingale, a pioneer of modern nursing practices, this award recognizes top quality emergency de-partments and staff for their extraordinary per-formance and innovative procedures, as well as their outstanding roles of leadership, advo-cacy, and research. The Children’s Emer-gency Room at Inova Loudoun Hospital is only one of eleven emergency rooms nationwide to have received this award, and I could not be more proud of them for receiving this high honor. This award serves as proof of Inova Loudoun Hospital’s commitment to providing the best care possible, while also fostering a healthy work environment for their staff. The Children’s Emergency Room opened in 2006 to meet the needs of the growing population in this part of my district. The facility treats nearly 20,000 patients annually, and remains the only emergency room in the county dedicated to the care of children. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the doctors, nurses, and ad-ministrators at the Children’s Emergency Room at Inova Loudoun Hospital for receiving the Lantern Award from the Emergency Nurses Association. I wish them all continued success, and thank them for diligently serving my constituents. f 
IN HONOR OF U.S. ARMY COR-PORAL AND WARRIOR GAMES TEAM ARMY MEMBER MATHEW MUELLER 
HON. KYRSTEN SINEMA 
OF ARIZONA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, July 25, 2016 Ms. SINEMA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor retired U.S. Army Corporal and Warrior Games Team Army member Mathew Mueller. Corporal Mueller was born and raised in Fort Morgan, Colorado. After graduating from high school, Corporal Mueller found his pas-sion in emergency medicine and used this calling to serve our country in the United States Army as a Combat Medic. On January 1, 2014, while preparing for his second combat deployment, Corporal Mueller was driving to his home town when his vehicle lost control on black ice. Corporal Mueller broke his neck and all the bones on the right side of his face leaving him visually impaired due to double vison and residual damage to his face. Corporal Mueller spent 10 months in intense physical therapy and rehabilitation. One year after the accident, he was transferred to a Warrior Transition Unit, designed to help wounded, ill, and injured soldiers transition to civilian life. It was there that he was intro-duced to adaptive sports. Through adaptive sports, Mueller competed in two Department of Defense Warrior Games. He participates in track, field, swimming and cycling. In the 2015 Warrior Games Mueller took home 9 gold, and 5 silver medals, and at the 2016 Warrior Games Mathew took home 10 gold, 1 silver, and 1 bronze medals. Mueller retired from the Army in December 2015, after nearly 6 years of service. He now resides in Phoenix, Arizona with his wife and family. Corporal Mueller’s unwavering commit-ment to greatness inspires all who know him. We honor his achievements, and thank him for his incredible service and sacrifice.

HONORING THE LIFE OF JONA GOLDRICH 
HON. TED LIEU 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, July 25, 2016 Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the life of Jona Goldrich—fa-ther, husband, grandfather, Holocaust sur-vivor, real estate developer, and philan-thropist—who passed away on June 26, 2016, at the age of 88. Born September 11, 1927 in Lviv, Poland, Jona escaped the Nazi occupation by fleeing with his brother Avraham to Hungary in 1942, eventually reaching Israel. The rest of their family died in concentration camps. Jona left Israel after 11 years for the United States where he hoped to attend Massachu-setts Institute of Technology. But after being denied admission because of his limited English skills, Jona decided to go across the country to southern California, where he ar-rived on a bus with only $50 in his pocket. Jona began working as a window and screen installer and a year later, he started a subcontracting cleaning business, setting his foot into the world of real estate. In 1956, at the age of 29, he built his first apartment building, and in 1959 he met a construction la-borer and a fellow Holocaust survivor named Sol Kest with whom he founded the Goldrich & Kest Industries. Jona was a visionary. In the 1960s when there were only offices and governmental buildings in downtown Los Angeles, he de-cided to construct residential buildings in downtown LA despite skepticism about wheth-er the area could attract residents. Jona also built one of Marina del Rey’s first apartment complexes in 1968 seeing an opportunity to transform it into an attractive beach city. Jona was also a philanthropist who contrib-uted to the American society in many ways. His firm constructed 72 apartment buildings that accommodate low-income families. He founded the Goldrich Family Foundation which supports Jewish and Israeli charities as well as educational causes. Jona is also remem-bered for his lifelong work on raising public awareness of the Holocaust, and he played an important role in the founding of the Los Ange-les Museum of the Holocaust, located in my district. He is survived by his wife of 56 years, Doretta; brother Avraham; daughters Melinda and Andrea Goldrich Cayton; and grand-children Garrett, Lindsay and Derek. I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the life of Jona Goldrich.

HONORING L IUNA LOCAL 304 
HON. BARBARA LEE 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, July 25, 2016 Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to LiUNA Local 304—Alameda County as they celebrate 100 years of solidarity and a commitment to a safe work environment for their members. On April 13, 1916, LiUNA Local 304—Ala-meda County was signed into existence with the founding mission of ‘‘We, the undersigned wage workers, believing it to be well cal-culated to improve our intellectual and social condition, and to promote our industrial well- being and advancement, respectfully petition the International Hod Carriers’, Building and Common Laborers’ Union of North America to grant us a Charter as representatives of said International Union.’’ LiUNA Local 304—Alameda County was born out of a petition to the International Hod Carriers’, Building and Common Laborers’ Union of North America to grant us a Charter as representatives of said International Union. They chartered by President Anderson, Vice President Walker, Recording Secretary Burke, Financial Secretary Hawley, Correspondence Secretary Van Deventer, Treasurer Cottingham, Sergeant-at-Arms Wilcox, Guard Norris and Executive Board members Evans, Canady, Jones, Cayne and Falk, LiUNA Local 304—Alameda County (as it is known today) was chartered on April 13, 1916 in Oakland, California, with a fierce commitment to those words and born out of the necessity and con-stant struggle of the disenfranchised commu-nity, knowing that tangible sacrifices would soon follow to ensure the working men and women of the East Bay would be protected by this promise. This chartering occurred during a time when the City of Oakland was growing by leaps and bounds due in part by the industrial explosion in the San Francisco Bay Area, LiUNA Local 304—Alameda County served the commu-nities of not just Oakland, but the surrounding cities that make up Alameda County. Further, the San Francisco earthquake of 1906 helped double Alameda County’s popu-lation and industry overnight. During this time, Oakland became host to over 50 assembly and component plants with close to 300,000 residents many of whom became lifelong members of LiUNA Local 304—Alameda County. With construction of marvels such as Kai-ser’s Bay Bridge and Bechtel’s Golden Gate Bridge, the Laborers served a real need to the construction industry not just as a work force but as a melting pot of sorts, bringing the ma-jority of white male unionized workers together with both the immigrant Mexican and African American workers at the time. The early years of organizing were especially difficult due to the anti-union climate in Oakland and the Ala-meda County government. Throughout the decades in the face of ad-versity and antagonism, LiUNA Local 304—Al-ameda County has never forgotten that they exist because of loyalty to their members. Re-gardless of their successes and failures, their members, families and community will always be at the heart of their work and their commit-ment to the mission. Today, with more than 30,000 brothers and sisters in Northern Cali-fornia, of which 5,000 reside in Alameda County, they continue to do outstanding work. On behalf of the residents of California’s 13th Congressional District, I extend my sin-cerest congratulations to LiUNA Local 304— Alameda County on the special occasion of its Centennial Anniversary. I thank LiUNA Local 304—Alameda County for providing critical unionization and protection for labor workers and their families in my district, and wish them many more years of success.

Mr. Holtz, a Loudoun County resident since 1985, and a Leesburg resident since 1995, has been the program coordinator since 2012. With more than 28 years of service to our na-tion as a retired United States Marine Corps Gunnery Sergeant Reservist, as well as the former Police Supervisor of the United States Capitol Police, Mr. Holtz embodies the very best of this nation’s values through his service to our community. I would also like to person-ally commend his continued dedication to the Loudoun County Crime Commission, of which he is the Vice-Chairman, as well as his exem-plary role in service on the Loudoun County Transportation Commission as the Leesburg representative. Through Mr. Holtz’s outstanding leadership, Toys for Tots in Loudoun County has distrib-uted more than 23,000 toys to less fortunate children. I would like to personally commend the men and women of Toys for Tots who so generously commit both time and supplies to the program, without asking anything in return. Although the campaign begins in October, many tasks begin as early as August to en-sure the success of the program each year. Frank Holtz and every volunteer at Toys for Tots deserve immense praise. The continued success of the program is a clear testament to the outstanding work which is conducted by these exemplary individuals and they are de-serving of recognition.

Jimmy then joined the New York Police Department in No-vember of 1979 where he rose to the rank of Sergeant Supervisor as a member of Mayor Rudy Giuliani’s personal protective detail be-fore retiring in 2000. But retirement did not slow Jimmy down. After the devastation of 9/11 he sought to

bring personal remembrance to his adopted home in Carmel, NY. Jimmy and his band of brothers in Carmel erected a memorial to the members of Putnam County who lost their lives that day. Each year since, he has coordi-nated the memorial remembrance faithfully at-tended each year by so many. He renamed the Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 704 to the Stephen P. Driscoll Memorial Lodge. And al-though Jimmy left the Bronx, his heart never did. He was a founding member of the New York Shields, an organization that coined the motto, ‘‘Cops for Cops.’’ Every year at the Ma-rina del Ray in The Bronx a service was held to remember those who gave their lives in service to the community. He was passionate that their names would be remembered and their memories protected and respected. Of course for all of his accomplishments, Jimmy’s greatest legacy is his family. He is survived by his wife, Kathy, his son, James Jr., two brothers, four sisters, and seven nieces and nephews. Jimmy O’Neill was an icon in every commu-nity he was ever involved with. His empathy, compassion, and selflessness will forever stand as a shining example of what it means to be a member of one’s community. I want to offer my deepest condolences to his entire family, and say that although we have lost a great man, his memory and the incredible work he did in life will surely stand the test of time and live forever.

HONORING MILLS GROVE CHRIS-TIAN CHURCH (DISCIPLES OF CHRIST) 
HON. BARBARA LEE 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, July 25, 2016 Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mills Grove Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) located in Oakland, California upon its 41st Anniversary as a strong religious pillar in the East Bay community. Mills Grove Christian Church (Disciples of Christ ) is a product of a merger between two Bay Area Disciples of Christ Congregations: Mills Terrace Christian Church in Oakland, a predominantly Angelo-American congregation and Grove Street Christian Church in Berke-ley, whose membership was largely African- American. Mills Terrace Christian Church was formed in the home of Mr. and Mrs. F.E. Wixon in 1926. The congregation soon outgrew the home, and with 26 Sunday school students and four teachers, the church moved into a tent on MacArthur Boulevard. The tent was later moved to Kingsland & Madera Streets and with 34 members, the church was offi-cially organized. In 1927, the church pur-chased a building on Brann & Morcom Streets for $8,000.00. In the 1940’s the building was moved on rollers to the current location at 5410 Fleming Avenue. Grove Street Christian Church, under the leadership of Rev. Willie D. Elder and Mr. Nor-man Harper, was started in 1947 to serve per-sons of color and others who desired to wor-ship in the Disciples of Christ denomination. Initially, the group organized as Second Chris-tian Church, which quickly gained momentum. In September of 1949, the congregation in-vited Reverend Dr. Peter C. Washington, former President of Jarvis Christian College in Hawkins, Texas, to serve as their minister. The church quickly grew to 103 active mem-bers and the search began for a more perma-nent church home. On May 2, 1954 the church moved to a new location on Grove & Parker Streets in Berkeley, thus renaming the church, Grove Street Christian Church. In 1970, Mills Terrace was becoming an aging Congregation, with the median age of the 22 members hovering at 60. After con-versations about a creative solution to this di-lemma, Mills Terrace reached out to its sister congregation, Grove Street Christian Church, to being discussions of merging. Ultimately, the DOC congregations became one within the Body of Christ and on Pentecost Sunday, May 18, 1975, the merger was completed as the new name, Mills Grove Christian Church (Disciples of Christ). Since 2007, the church has been pastored by its committed, brilliant and spirit filled pastor, Rev. Clarence Johnson, who leads with humility and love. Mills Grove Christian Church continues to serve the community today with four major ministry goals: Evangelism & Outreach, Youth Emphasis, Stewardship & Finance, and Wor-ship & Praise. The congregation worships under the motto ‘‘Live Rejoicing . . . Every-day!’’ based on Psalm 118:24; St. John 10:10b; and, Philippians 4:4. On behalf of the residents of California’s 13th Congressional District, I extend my sin-cerest congratulations to Mills Grove Christian Church (DOC) on the special occasion of its 41st anniversary. I wish Mills Grove Christian Church many more years of faithful, compas-sionate, and visionary service. f 
IN MEMORIAM OF HAROLD STAHL, JULY 23, 1938–MARCH 8, 2016 
HON. KYRSTEN SINEMA 
OF ARIZONA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, July 25, 2016 Ms. SINEMA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember Mr. Harold Stahl (Hal) who passed away at the age of 78 on March 8, 2016 in Phoenix, AZ. Born in the Bronx, Hal was the son of Russian immigrants Fannie Weisberg and Benjamin Stahl. After the loss of his sister Selma when Hal was only two years old, his mother doted on her little ‘‘Boo Boo’’. He lost his parents while he was still very young, so his older siblings Joseph, Gertrude and Marilyn (Mickey) became like parents to him and he grew very close to his nieces and nephews Barbara, Bill, Neil, Eileen, Robin and Shoshana. After earning his undergraduate degree in Physics from Columbia, he went on to earn a Master’s in Physics at Brooklyn Polytechnic. He attributed the teaching assistant job he got there to a recommendation letter that was sent on his behalf by Nobel Prize winner, Polycarp Kusch. While wolking on the PhD that he was unable to complete due to equipment failure, he met his future wife Toby Schleifer who was a Chemist at NYU. They were introduced in the young adult group at Brooklyn Heights Synagogue in May of 1965 and were married in December of that year. Together they started their family in Flush-ing, Queens where they welcomed their son Barry and daughter Fran. After relocating to Ridgefield, Connecticut they were joined by their third child Carrie. Hal earned his MBA from the University of New Haven before the family relocated to Phoenix, Arizona to live near Toby’s family. While working as a software engineer on the Apache helicopters, he earned his third Master’s degree in Aerospace Engineering in the same year that Fran got her Bachelor’s and Canie graduated from high school. The family grew to include a daughter-in-law, Pat-tie, son-in-law, Lewis and four amazing grandsons. Hal adored Jonas, Kai, Rei and Ari and helped their parents foster their individual personalities and interests. In their retirement years, Hal and Toby were dedicated to their grandsons and to volunteering for non-profit organizations that supported healthcare, the environment, protecting Arizona’s natural his-tory and progressive politics. Hal was a proud lifelong Democrat. He was a Precinct Com-mitteeman as well as a member of the Arizona state Democratic committee and a proud vol-unteer for Democracy for America Maricopa County. Most importantly, the best way to honor Hal and what he would have requested is that you make sure that you and everyone you know gets out to vote. f 
HONORING THE 125TH ANNIVER-SARY OF MARTHA AND MARY 
HON. DEREK KILMER 
OF WASHINGTON  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, July 25, 2016 Mr. KILMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Martha & Mary, a not-for-profit organiza-tion that has provided quality and compas-sionate care for children, seniors, and families in the western Puget Sound region of Wash-ington state since 1891. From its inception, Martha & Mary has been a champion for our region’s most vulnerable. What started as a small home for orphaned youth has blossomed into a regional organiza-tion that provides services for more than 1,000 children at ten different sites throughout the Kitsap peninsula. Martha & Mary’s nationally recognized pro-grams emphasize a commitment to ‘‘bridging generations and emiching lives’’ by encour-aging children to spend time with senior care residents through singing songs, sharing meals, and completing projects. As a testa-ment to the success of this innovative ap-proach, in 2015, Martha & Mary received the prestigious Quality of Excellence rating from Washington state’s premier child care rating system. Martha & Mary continues to serve our re-gion by growing to meet the evolving needs of our community. Each year, Martha & Mary provides nearly $2.1 million in underfunded care and has expanded services to include long term care, rehabilitation facilities, assisted living, home care, and geriatric care manage-ment. Martha & Mary is an example of an organi-zation that, from its core, strives to create meaningful experiences for children, adults, and the elderly to grow in understanding and appreciation of the gifts that both young and old have to offer. For 125 years, their quality

and compassionate care has provided a crit-ical safety net and has helped to strengthen the fabric of our community.

Our community is stronger thanks to Martha & Mary’s leadership and I am honored to recognize them today in the United States Congress.

HONORING THE OAKLAND WOMEN’S ROWING CLUB 
HON. BARBARA LEE 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, July 25, 2016 Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the oldest recreational club in Oakland, Cali-fornia, the Oakland Women’s Rowing Club, upon its 100th Anniversary as an outstanding athletic and recreational club in the East Bay Community. Oakland Women’s Rowing Club, the mem-bers of which are known as the ‘‘Ladies of the Lake,’’ was founded on February 2, 1916 when volleyball players from Bushrod Recre-ation Center, Lockwood School, and Mosswood School sought a greater athletic challenge. Five boats were donated to the Club by the United States Navy. All of these boats, and those since acquired, have been deeded to the City of Oakland, so they may be enjoyed by the public. From the beginning, the ‘‘Ladies of the Lake’’ have been rowing on Lake Merritt in Oakland, the first designated Wildlife Refuge in the United States. The members row week-ly on Wednesday mornings all year round, no matter the weather. They come from many re-gions of the United States and from across the world. There are many active members, rang-ing in age from their fifties to their nineties. The women come from a variety of back-grounds and work an array of professions. The ‘‘Ladies of the Lake’’ value their time on the lake, and many locals wave at the women rowing in their old fashioned white and blue uniforms, with orange coats in the winter. Throughout the Oakland Women’s Rowing Club’s tenure as the longest scheduled activity on Lake Merritt and the oldest women’s row-ing club in the nation, the ‘‘Ladies of the Lake’’ have participated in civic activities for the City of Oakland, often representing the city in film appearances, photographs, parades, and press features. The Club also acts as a good-will ambassador for the City of Oakland. Since 1916, the Club has held many suc-cessful fundraisers to purchase or commission more fiberglass whale boats, all of which are available for public use in Oakland. Beyond obtaining and caring for their boats, the women work hard to maintain the Club and add to Lake Merritt’s unique ambience. For in-stance, the club was the first to donate toward the original lamps in the Necklace of Lights that encircles Lake Merritt, and has supported Lake Merritt beautification projects ever since. The Oakland Women’s Rowing Club meets monthly for luncheons with all of the members and benefactors. The waitlist for membership is always long. This organization has certainly inspired commitment and athleticism in its members. On behalf of the residents of California’s 13th Congressional District, I extend my sin-cerest congratulations to Oakland Women’s Rowing Club on the special occasion of its 100th Anniversary. I wish Oakland Women’s Rowing Club many more years of success. f 
HONOLRING NORMAN BRODY, CANTOR OF TEMPLE BETH EL 
HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS 
OF FLORIDA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, July 25, 2016 Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Norman Brody, who is the Cantor of Temple Beth El in West Palm Beach, Florida. He has served this congregation since 1986 and is one of Palm Beach County’s most fa-mous and popular cantors. Cantor Brody was educated at the B’Nai Zion and College of Jewish Studies in Chicago, Illinois. He later at-tended the University of Michigan, where he received both his Bachelor’s and Master’s de-grees. Cantor Brody sang with the Chicago Lyric Opera and the New York Opera Company, ap-pearing with another famous tenor, Placido Domingo. He was also the featured soloist and musical arranger for the Winged Victory Singers and, from 1965 to 1980, he appeared in top hotels and on concert stages, as well as on radio and television. Before coming to Temple Beth El, he was the cantor at Temple Emanuel in Andover, Massachusetts, Temple Emeth in Brookline, Massachusetts and at Beth Israel Mikra Kodesh in Baltimore, Maryland. Besides hav-ing an award winning voice, Norman Brody has received the City of Peace Award and the Community Achievement Award from Amer-ican ORT. His annual concert is a highlight of every year, regularly drawing huge crowds to hear ‘‘the man with the golden voice’’ perform reli-gious music, show tunes and popular stand-ards. An accomplished pianist, he accom-panies himself at Sabbath services to the de-light of congregants, who have remarked that it’s always a special occasion when they hear him sing. Cantor Brody also devotes time to con-ducting Temple Beth El’s Youth and Adult Choirs and is a dedicated and committed member of our community. He is active in many organizations, including B’Nai B’rith, the Palm Beach County Clergy Cantor’s Associa-tion and Ambassadors Society of Trustees of Israel Bonds. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to honor this fine man, who is not only a tremendous treasure for Temple Beth El, but an enormous credit to his community and our nation.

HONORING MR. ROBERT L. HARRIS 
HON. BARBARA LEE 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, July 25, 2016 Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the extraordinary life and work of Robert L. Harris, on the occasion of his induction into the California Association of Black Lawyers’ Hall of Fame. Mr. Harris’s contribution to Pa-cific Gas and Electric (PG&E) and to the body of law is testament to his service and dedica-tion. A proud Oakland native, Mr. Harris grad-uated from Merritt College in 1963, and later pursued his law degree from the Boalt School of Law at the University of California, Berke-ley. Mr. Harris was admitted to the California State Bar on December 13, 1973, and com-pleted numerous education advancement pro-grams throughout the remainder of his career, including the Advanced Management Program at the Harvard School of Business, and the Management Development Program at Duke University’s School of Business. Mr. Harris began his career with PG&E in 1989, managing one of the major operating di-visions in the East Bay Region. As the first lawyer appointed to such a position, Mr. Harris proved his excellent leadership and refined acumen for business as he faced the after-math of the Loma Prieta Earthquake in 1989. Shortly afterwards, the Oakland Hills Firestorm tested PG&E’s ability to react, and under Mr. Harris’s leadership, they were able to restore service in record time to Bay Area homes, earning PG&E numerous accolades for their impeccable work. Within law, Mr. Harris has distinguished himself amongst his peers. He served in nu-merous leadership positions within influential organizations such as the American Associa-tion of Blacks in Energy, the U.S. EPA’s Na-tional Advisory Council on Environmental Jus-tice, the National Energy Policy Commission, and the California League of Conservation Voters. He has timelessly shown his dedica-tion to furthering societal advancement and improving the lives of the Bay Area residents. In addition to his contributions to law, Mr. Harris has served the public interest over the length of his career. The NAACP honored Mr. Harris with the William Robert Ming Award, the highest legal honor they bestow, for his dedication to issues that plague the African- American community. He currently chairs the United Negro College Fund’s Bay Area Advi-sor Board, helping to provide scholarship and financial assistance to African-American stu-dents in need, and has earned the Fredrick D. Patterson Award for his commitment to the mission of this organization. Mr. Harris’s retirement from PG&E in 2007 left behind an outstanding company that serves the interests of the Bay Area, providing our constituents with access to affordable and reliable energy services. PG&E has prospered under the legacy of leadership that Mr. Harris instilled, and these contributions to our com-munity do not go unnoticed. On a personal note, on behalf of the resi-dents of California’s 13th Congressional Dis-trict, Robert L. Harris, I salute you. I thank you for your service to your nation and your com-munity, and echo the praise you receive from the California Black Lawyers’ Association through your esteemed induction into the Hall of Fame.

HON. DAVID G. VALADAO 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, July 25, 2016 Mr. VALADAO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and service of Sanger Police Of-ficer, Mr. Rodney Jones who tragically passed away on June 17, 2016. Mr. Jones was born in Lompoc, California to Lela and Richard Ira Jones. After attending local schools in Clovis, California, Mr. Jones completed his education in 1978. After being introduced to the law enforce-ment profession by his brother-in-law, Mr. Jones went on to receive his Peace Officer Basic Training (POST) certification from the College of the Sequoias in 1996. That same year, he began his career with the Sanger Po-lice Department as a patrolman. Mr. Jones would go on to serve the department diligently in many roles, including Detective, Drug Rec-ognition Expert, and Field Training Officer. The Sanger Police Department is left better off because of his service. In his personal time, Mr. Jones enjoyed spending time with his children and grand-children. As an outdoor enthusiast, Mr. Jones was passionate about off-road vehicles, hunt-ing, fishing, and camping, and he loved to share those experiences with family and friends. Additionally, Mr. Jones was a founder and Vice-President of the Sanger Badlands Posse Jeep Club, comprised of fellow police officers, the group would organize rock crawl-ing trips. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the United States House of Representatives to join me in honoring the life and achievements of Mr. Rodney Jones. My thoughts and pray-ers are with his family and friends during this difficult time.

WOMEN LEADERS URGE ACTION ON GUN VIOLENCE 
HON. KATHERINE M. CLARK 
OF MASSACHUSETTS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, July 25, 2016 Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I submit the following letter from prominent women leaders from around the country, which urges Congress to take action on gun violence by implementing universal back-ground checks. 
WOMEN ’SCOALITION FORCOMMON SENSE  J
ULY14, 2016. M
EMBERS OF CONGRESS : We are a coalition of women leaders from business, law enforce-ment, government, domestic violence pre-vention, women’s advocacy, journalism, en-tertainment and public health. Like Ameri-cans all across our country, we are outraged by the mass killing in Orlando and other re-cent tragic events. Our thoughts and prayers remain with the victims and their families. But sadly, these recent tragedies are only the latest horrific events in our national gun violence crisis that claimed 33,000 lives last year. This crisis is destroying families and our communities. That’s why we have come together to de-mand that you do more to keep guns out of the wrong hands, protect the Second Amend-ment rights of law-abiding Americans, and save lives. We are not alone. Americans— Democrats, Republicans, and Independents— agree that we need stronger laws to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people. It is time for lawmakers like you to listen to your constituents, the very people you were elected to serve. You can start to address our gun violence crisis by acting to close the loopholes in our laws that allow domestic abusers and felons to buy a gun without a criminal background check. Unlike federally licensed gun dealers, unlicensed sellers are not required to con-duct background checks on gun purchases, often with devastating consequences for women and families. Strengthening our laws and closing these dangerous loopholes would save lives. In states with background checks on all hand-gun sales, 46% fewer women are murdered with a gun by their intimate partners. As we continue to mourn the losses from gun violence everywhere, we urge you to give voice to the concerns of your constituents and honor the memory of the 33,000 Ameri-cans killed by gun violence every year and enact real, meaningful, and responsible solu-tions that can help prevent gun tragedies, and make our communities safer places to live.

HONORING WILLIAM BYRON RUMFORD 
HON. BARBARA LEE 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, July 25, 2016 Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the extraordinary life of an outstanding mem-ber of the East Bay community the Honorable William Byron Rumford. He was born in Courtland, Arizona in 1915. As a child, he shined shoes, sold newspapers, and graduated from George Washington Carver High School in Phoenix in 1926. After finishing his studies at Sacramento Junior Col-lege in 1931, he earned his pharmacy degree at the University of California, San Francisco. After he graduated, he took a number of exams for employment and was discriminated against at every turn. He fought his way through by appealing his oral examination, ulti-mately becoming a member of the California Board of Pharmacy. Mr. Rumford worked in the Bay Area as an assistant pharmacist and as a venereal dis-ease investigator for the state. In 1942, he co- invested in a pharmacy on Sacramento Street in Berkeley, which he later purchased and re-named Rumford’s Pharmacy (now known as the Rumford Clinic). Later, served as the di-rector of the Oakland chapter of the Red Cross, president of the East Bay Health Asso-ciation, and was on the region’s Democratic Central Committee. Mr. Rumford went on to lead an impactful and significant political career, and ultimately became the first African American legislator from Northern California. Inspired by the dis-parities he witnessed in his pharmaceutical ca-reer, he joined the Berkeley Emergency Hous-ing Committee in 1942 and the Berkeley Rent Board in 1944. In addition, he worked with the unofficial Berkeley Interracial Committee which was intended to ease tensions between the Black community of Berkeley and White south-erners who were moving in. He was also a member of the Appomattox Club, which was one of the first African American political orga-nizations in the country; there was little hope for an African American candidate at that time, so the organization supported White can-didates who they believed were right on polit-ical issues affecting the African American community. Mr. Rumford did not seek to become a pro-fessional politician; instead, he was a neigh-borhood pharmacist who was passionate about addressing the biggest issues impacting his community. Eventually, Mr. Rumford ran for election in the California Assembly and won in 1949. At first he represented mostly Af-rican American areas of Oakland and a por-tion of South Berkeley. In 1960, however, the district was enlarged to include more of Berke-ley and Albany. As an Assembly member, Mr. Rumford produced several effective pieces of legislation. In 1949, he worked tirelessly to pass The Bill to End Discrimination in the Na-tional Guard, which lessoned racial discrimina-tion in the National Guard. He also introduced legislation early in his Assembly tenure per-taining to fair trade, small businesses, child polio immunizations, atomic energy conver-sion, and environmental pollution. Today, Mr. Rumford is best remembered for three pieces of legislation: the California Fair Employment Practices Act of 1959, which lessoned the impact of race on hiring deci-sions; the Good Samaritan Act of 1959, which garnered national attention as the first law in the country to protect professionals in emer-gency situations; and the law that bore his name: the Rumford Fair Housing Act of 1963, which failed to survive a referendum chal-lenge, but was upheld by the Supreme Court of the United States. This act served as Cali-fornia’s main enforcement authority against race-based housing discrimination, by way of housing covenants, until the passage of the Federal Civil Rights Act of 1968. His tremendous legacy paved the way for civil rights legislation nationally, and has been beautifully honored by the William Byron Rumford Memorial Project. This project is led by a diverse group of community members who see the rapid changing of South Berke-ley’s demographics as a ripe time to honor his leadership, activism, and community, while preserving the neighborhood’s history. On a personal note, William was a trail-blazer. Had it not been for him, I never would have been elected to the CA legislature. I owe him a debt of gratitude and I will be forever grateful. Today, California’s 13th Congressional Dis-trict salutes the legacy of the Honorable Wil-liam Byron Rumford. His contributions have truly impacted countless lives through the East Bay area and the country. I join all of Mr. Rumford’s loved ones and the community members involved in the William Byron Rumford Memorial Project in celebrating his incredible life and legacy. HONORING THE NATIONAL ASSO-CIATION OF BLACK MILITARY WOMEN HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, July 25, 2016 Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor an organization that has served our vet-eran community with great distinction for 40 years, the National Association of Black Mili-tary Women. The NABMW is an association of women lo-cated throughout the country who are veterans or current members of the United States Armed Forces. The group was founded in July of 1976, when a group of 21 women who served in the Women’s Army Auxiliary Corps (WAAC) and Women’s Army Corps (WAC) during World War II, Korean and Vietnam wars got together at Lucille Brown’s house in Hampton, Virginia. At this chartered meeting, the group decided to locate and invite other former service women to a first reunion that was held in 1978 in Dallas, Texas. Ever since, Biennial Reunions have contin-ued to be held all through the country, where members discuss many of the issues facing the veteran community of black military women. The NABMW mission, ‘‘To seek out, record, maintain and tell the history and herit-age of African-American Military Women who served and are serving in the United States Armed Forces’’ is as strong and power today on the organization’s 40th anniversary as it was on the very first. This year, NABMW is holding their biennial conference from August 10–14. I want to con-gratulate the entire organization on the occa-sion and thank them for their service.

IN RECOGNITION OF TYLER WEGMEYER BEING NAMED VIR-GINIA’S 2016 FARMER OF THE YEAR 
HON. BARBARA COMSTOCK 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, July 25, 2016 Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Tyler Wegmeyer of Wegmeyer Farms in Loudoun County for being named the 2016 Farmer of the Year by the Virginia Cooperative Extension. This important mile-stone highlights the diversity and success of the agriculture industry in both Loudoun Coun-ty and the Commonwealth as a whole. Mr. Wegmeyer has lived in Loudoun with his wife, Harriet, for nearly 17 years. Their farm spans over 250 acres at four separate loca-tions and employs over 80 people. Mr. Wegmeyer has a long career in agriculture both firsthand as a farmer and additionally as a policymaker. The Wegmeyer family strongly believes in being good stewards of the land and caring for the environment. Their involvement in the community has been important to the growth of agro tourism and educating more people about how food is grown. It is the leaders like Mr. and Mrs. Wegmeyer who through their ac-tive engagement will continue to shape the ag-ricultural sector of the United States as well as

the economy of our Commonwealth and our country. The success of Mr. Wegmeyer is a tremendous accomplishment that should make him and his family proud.

HONORING DON JELINEK 
HON. BARBARA LEE 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, July 25, 2016 Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the extraordinary life of an outstanding mem-ber of the Bay Area community, Mr. Don Jelinek. With his passing on March 23, 2016, we honor his commitment and service to our community. Mr. Don Jelinek was born Feb. 17, 1934 in Bronx, New York, the proud son of two Jewish immigrants. His heritage, culture, education, and experience played key roles in the man he became. He attended the Bronx High School of Science and later New York University where he received both his Bachelor of Arts and Juris Doctorate. In 1955, he moved to a tene-ment in Greenwich Village where he worked as a janitor in exchange for rent. He was often seen returning the building’s garbage cans be-fore walking to his law classes. In the Village, Mr. Jelinek was exposed to the beauty of di-versity. He met people from different races, classes, creeds, cultures, religions, and sexual orientations. Their stories, experiences, and life lessons fueled his passion for politics, reading, and theatre until the day he died. After receiving his J.D., Mr. Jelinek took a job as an attorney on Wall Street. In 1965, he traveled to Mississippi to work with the Amer-ican Civil Liberties Union for a three-week stint. At the end of that visit, he decided to stay behind and work with the Student Non-violent Coordinating Committee. Mr. Jelinek remained in the South for three years and focused on ending the overtly racist practices of the U.S. Department of Agri-culture. In the process he shined a light on the shameful realities of rural malnutrition and starvation in America. Over the years he pro-vided legal representation for individuals and organizations involved in civil rights including Martin Luther King, Jr., Stokely Carmichael, H. ‘‘Rap’’ Brown, black sharecroppers, SNCC, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and the NAACP. He later defended 61 in-mates who had been indicted for 1,400 felo-nies in connection with the Attica Prison upris-ing. Mr. Jelinek moved to Berkeley in 1969 and continued his civil rights efforts throughout the Bay Area. When a group of Native Americans seized Alcatraz in 1969 and lived there for 19 months, claiming the land under a 100-year- old treaty, Jelinek moved to the island to as-sist them. He later defended hundreds of flea market vendors, free of charge, after they were ousted from the Ashby BART parking lot. The vendors were later reinstated. Soon after his successful advocacy, Mr. Jelinek decided to run for Berkeley City Coun-cil where he proudly served from 1984 to 1990. After his tenure, he became a trusted advisor to the council. In addition to his legal and political career, Mr. Jelinek authored three books, ‘‘Survivor of the Alamo,’’ ‘‘Attica Justice,’’ and ‘‘White Law-yer, Black Power.’’ Both his life and legacy are testaments to what our country stands for and our continued fight for true and lasting equal-ity. Mr. Jelinek is survived by his brother Roger, his wife Jane Scherr, his children Dove and Apollinaire, and his grandchildren Hanelle and Pascal. Today, California’s 13th Congressional Dis-trict salutes the legacy of Mr. Don Jelinek. His contributions have truly impacted countless lives. I join all of Mr. Don Jelinek’s loved ones in celebrating his incredible life and offer my most sincere condolences.
