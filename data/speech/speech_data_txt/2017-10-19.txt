ATCH ).

PRAYER The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-fered the following prayer: Let us pray. Eternal Savior, we thank You for the fellowship of Your Spirit and Your con-solations of love. May our lawmakers remember that You are their rock and refuge. Lord, speak peace to their hearts in these turbulent times, guid-ing them along the path of Your wis-dom. Reward their efforts with a joyful harvest, as they strive to build up and not tear down. Raise them above dis-cord and division, helping them to work together to keep America strong. We are grateful for the favor You have given this Nation and for sur-rounding us with the shield of Your compassion, mercy, and love. Strong Deliverer, accept our grateful praise. We pray in Your mighty Name. Amen. 
f

I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Repub-lic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. H
ELLER ). The majority leader is recog-nized. 
f 
THE BUDGET AND TAX REFORM Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, the Senate is taking the next critical step in passing the comprehensive, fiscally responsible budget before us. It is pret-ty obvious that this is a good budget, and that is true whether you are look-ing at it from a fiscal perspective or an economic one. Take the fiscal side first. It reins in government spending. It protects So-cial Security. It complies fully with the previous spending caps, while also providing for an increase for defense re-sources if a bipartisan agreement can be reached. In short, it is a fiscally re-sponsible budget that will help put the Federal Government on a path to bal-ance. On the economic side, this budget can help our country realize better and more sustained economic growth, which is critical, given the last decade of missed opportunities for the middle class. One way this budget can help our economy is by providing legislative tools to advance tax reform. As I have said many times before, tax reform represents the most important thing we can do today to get our econ-omy reaching for its true potential. Tax reform is all about getting Amer-ica going again and growing again. It aims to take more money out of Wash-ington’s pockets and put more money in middle-class pockets, and it rep-resents a once-in-a-generation oppor-tunity to replace a failing tax bill that holds Americans back with one that works for them. Passing this budget is critical to getting tax reform done so we can strengthen our economy, after years of stagnation under the previous administration. I know Members are eager to con-tinue proposing amendments to this budget. We already adopted some good ideas yesterday. For instance, the Sen-ate adopted an amendment offered by Senator HELLER to provide tax relief to American families with children so they can have more money to make ends meet. We also adopted an amendment from Senator C
OLLINS to provide relief to small businesses, which have been re-sponsible for the creation of about two- thirds of the net jobs in recent years. That is according to statistics from the Small Business Administration. Both of these amendments reinforce the goals of the tax reform framework de-veloped by the President, his team, and the tax-writing committees in Con-gress. Today we will consider more ideas from colleagues on both sides of the aisle. I want to thank, particularly, Chairman ENZIand the members of the Senate Budget Committee for their good work in getting us to this point. The budget they produced is important to our fiscal and our economic future. I look forward to passing it soon. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. S
TRANGE ). Without objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the leadership time is reserved.

CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS The PRESIDING OFFICER. Morning business is closed.

CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET, FISCAL YEAR 2018 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will re-sume consideration of H. Con. Res. 71, which the clerk will report. The legislative clerk read as follows: 
A concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 71) establishing the congressional budget for the United States Government for fiscal year 2018 and setting forth the appropriate budg-etary levels for fiscal years 2019 through 2027.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES6594 October 19, 2017 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 11:45 a.m. will be equally divided between the managers or their designees. The Senator from Oregon. 
AMENDMENT NO . 1302 TO AMENDMENT NO . 1116 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1302 as provided for under the previous order. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report. The legislative clerk read as follows: 
The Senator from Oregon [Mr. W YDEN ] pro- poses an amendment numbered 1302 to amendment No. 1116. 
The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To strike the reconciliation instructions relating to tax reform) After section 2002, insert the following: 
SEC. 2003. MODIFICATION TO RECONCILIATION INSTRUCTIONS. 
Section 2001(a) and 2002(a) are null and void. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President and col-leagues, later this morning, the Senate will be voting on the amendment I am offering to strike what are known as reconciliation instructions from the budget proposal. The reason I will be focused this morning on that is that it is absolutely key that we pass this amendment in order to get bipartisan tax reform. The fact is that reconciliation is an on- ramp to the most partisan process around, and the history of successful tax reform is in our working in a bipar-tisan way. For example, that is what the late President Reagan worked to do in 1986 with a whole host of Democrats, and they came up with a lot of very im-portant, bold, progressive ideas. They chose to actually treat income from a wage in the same way as one would treat income from investments so as to send, in one fell swoop, a message that working-class people would get a fair shake, that the tax law was not about the 1 percent back then but that it was about working-class people. The middle class drives 70 percent of the American economy. They were not talking about massive tax handouts to big corpora-tions and the wealthy; they were talk-ing about the fact that, in our country, economic success is built around a thriving middle class—a middle class that can buy homes and cars and edu-cate kids and pay for essentials. What troubles me so much about these reconciliation instructions that would allow for a $1.5 trillion net tax cut is that it is just the opposite of the kind of approach that Ronald Reagan and the Democrats used in 1986. It is going to polarize us rather than bring us together. I think that is particularly impor-tant right now, given the meeting that was held at the White House yesterday that I attended along with a number of Democratic colleagues on the Finance Committee, because at that meeting Democrats made it very clear to the President of the United States that we think that the Tax Code is broken, that it is a broken, dysfunctional mess. We described the letter we sent that lays out our principles that tax reform should focus not on the 1 percent but on the middle class and not savage Medicare and Medicaid and Social Se-curity, which are our essential retire-ment programs. What was striking about the discus-sion was that the President said: I agree with you on all of those things. He said: Tax cuts should not go for peo-ple like me. I want help for the middle class, and I don’t want to cut Medicare and Social Security. I made the point— I hope respectfully, Mr. President. I said: Unfortunately, there is a big gap between the administration’s rhetoric on this and the reality of what is really on paper. That is why it is so impor-tant that we strike these reconcili-ation instructions and make it clear from the get-go that we are going to get tax reform right, that we are not just going to kind of utter these sort of sound bites and rhetorical plights and speeches, as the discussions go out from various administration officials, and we actually focus on what it is going to take to do bipartisan tax re-form. The President agreed with the prin-ciples that Democrats talked about yesterday. It is very different when you see it on paper, and I want to talk a lit-tle bit about what is actually on paper. First, the Trump tax plan creates a massive new loophole, the Grand Can-yon of all loopholes, by twisting and abusing what is known as tax passthroughs. It used to be that the tax passthrough was for a store or a res-taurant or a garage. You see them all over Oregon. You see them all over America. Those are the people for whom we ought to be working together to give a boost to. That is not what is on paper. What is on paper is very dif-ferent, and it is very different than what the President said yesterday he wanted. For example, on paper is a new loop-hole that would allow tax cheats to self-declare as passthroughs, rake in income, and pay a much lower rate. It is a tax change that is deeply slanted toward what I call the top of the top— not just the 1 percent but the top of the top. Eighty-eight percent of the bene-fits of this kind of passthrough rate cut would go to those at the very top, ac-cording to recent analyses, the top 1 percent and those even more affluent. It opens the door for tax cheats to dodge paying into Social Security and Medicare like every hard-working wage earner in America. This would leave a lot of those programs that are lifelines for working families a lot worse off than they are today and that, too, is something the President said he didn’t want. Next, apropos again of the most af-fluent the President said he didn’t want to help, is the estate tax. Here, there is a proposal in the administra-tion’s plan to abolish the estate tax. Let’s make sure everybody understands who is affected by that. The tax today touches estates worth more than $11 million, $5.5 million for a single indi-vidual—a tiny fraction of all the es-tates in the country. Eliminating the estate tax isn’t a policy change that has anything to do with helping the middle class. It is entirely about help-ing the megawealthy—exactly the peo-ple the President told us yesterday he didn’t want to help. The Finance Committee Democratic staff put out a report last week that looked at some of the worst schemes and dodges that are used by the megawealthy to avoid paying estate tax. There is a cottage industry of crafty lawyers and accountants who have made careers out of gutting the estate tax by engineering billion-dollar tax shelters for the 1 percent. So the estate tax is already full of loopholes, but this administration isn’t interested in closing them even after the Treas-ury Secretary, Mr. Mnuchin, admitted just the other day that it goes mostly to the people at the very top. So there is a common thread in these proposals. There is a common thread in this debate that is driven by partisan-ship and reconciliation, which is why I want to strike those instructions. What is actually on paper—not what is said in the speeches or in sound bites and the like—is that the Republican plan doesn’t close the most egregious loopholes. It enshrines them as perma-nent features in our tax law. That is contrary to what the President said he wanted to do, and it certainly isn’t a tax recipe focused on the middle class. One of the individuals who has been most out in front of the cameras sell-ing the Trump tax plan to the public is the Treasury Secretary. A few weeks ago, the Secretary doubled down on the failed experiment that tax cuts pay for themselves. Forget the history that shows that isn’t true. Secretary Mnuchin said the Trump tax cuts will not just pay for themselves, they will raise an additional trillion dollars in revenue on top of their own costs. The fact is, there is no magical growth fairy, no unicorns, no kind of growth fairies that are going to somehow spring to life if this tax cut plan be-comes law, but Secretary Mnuchin, our Treasury Secretary, keeps going back to the unicorns, keeps going back to rainbow economics. What is striking is, I asked the Re-publican economist—the economist chosen by our friend and distinguished chairman O
RRIN HATCH —who came be-fore the Finance Committee the other day about whether tax cuts pay for themselves, and the Republican econo-mist chosen by the Republicans on the Finance Committee, those Repub-licans’ economist acknowledged that tax cuts don’t pay for themselves. There have been some other whop-pers about the Republican plan, at least what is again written down on paper. Secretary Mnuchin said it is very hard not to give tax cuts to the wealthy with tax cuts to the middle class. That is one stunner of a state-ment: It is very hard not to give tax

cuts to the wealthy. In the same inter-view, he delivered what sounded like a real ultimatum; that if the Congress doesn’t pass this plan so tilted to the megawealthy, oh, boy, it is going to be tough times on Wall Street. You have to appreciate the eye-popping honesty, but the ideas behind what the Treasury Secretary is talking about on tax re-form pretty much leave your jaw on the floor. If that is where the adminis-tration has trained its focus, as far as tax reform is concerned, the middle class is in tough straits. In my judgment, this is yet another reason the Senate should reject using reconciliation for taxes and support my amendment. The fact is, the Congress has never used reconciliation to write a comprehensive tax reform bill. There is a template for comprehensive tax re-form that has been proven to work, and I have mentioned it already. It is the one initiated by President Reagan, a big group of Democrats, a culmination of years of bipartisan work. What we saw was real bipartisanship, which I define as not taking each other’s bad ideas but taking each other’s good ideas. The bill was considered under regular order, it was debated in the Fi-nance Committee and on the Senate floor for months, and it was open to unlimited amendments and passed the Senate by a vote of 97 to 3. That is the kind of bipartisan process we would like to see. Democrats have made it clear, and we made it clear again yesterday, that we think the Tax Code is broken, that we have heard the President’s com-ments about how he wants to help the middle class and not the wealthy, that he understands how strongly we feel about protecting Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, but the fact is—and this is the heart of the chal-lenge—there is a big gap right now be-tween what the President says his pri-orities are and what is actually written down on paper. That is the challenge, and we are not going to be able to ad-dress that challenge, in my view, by signing up for more partisanship, for taking the most partisan route on tax reform. What we ought to be doing is saying that we all agree the Tax Code is bro-ken; we all understand the key is help-ing the middle class, not more hand-outs for the top of the top, the 1 per-cent; that we are sensitive to long- term costs because we don’t want to pass those off to our children. Doing that is best going to be accomplished by saying that as we move now to the actual consideration of tax reform, we reject partisan approaches like rec-onciliation, and we come together. I know we can do it. The fact is, what the President says when he speaks about this subject is in line with the principles in the Demo-crats’ letter. What we have talked about doesn’t even go as far as what President Reagan did in 1986. What is in the Democrats’ letter tracks a bipar-tisan piece of legislation that several colleagues here have been part of, in-cluding one in the President’s Cabinet now. We can do bipartisan tax reform that is good for our country. We shouldn’t make it a lot harder to accomplish that goal by including these partisan reconciliation instructions in the budg-et proposal. That is why I urge my col-leagues to support my amendment to strip these reconciliation instructions when we vote on my amendment later in the morning. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER  
The Democratic leader is recognized. Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to use leader time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. 
HEALTHCARE  
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first, on healthcare, my two good friends Senators A
LEXANDER and M URRAY have constructed a good, fair, bipartisan agreement that gives us a way forward on healthcare. It will offer stability in the markets, and it will help lower pre-miums. We have seen President Trump’s near-constant equivocation on the agreement. We shouldn’t let it impede the progress of this very important bi-partisan compromise. He is for the bill one day, against it the next. That is not uncommon; the President some-times is for and against something in the same sentence. We can only hope he comes around again once he grasps what is in the bill. The Alexander-Murray deal is not a bailout to the insurance companies at all; it is the opposite. We have taken pains to ensure that insurance compa-nies do not reap any benefits from this program. That is what A
LEXANDER and M
URRAY have done. They have explicit provisions in the bill to ensure that the cost-sharing program does what it is intended to do: Lower premiums, deductibles, and out-of-pocket costs for Americans who can least afford it. I was reading an article this morning where they interviewed a retired manu-facturing worker in Pennsylvania who was upset by the President’s decision. The man said: 
It seems like he is trying to hurt the mid-dle class. . . . He [President Trump] says he’s going to make it better for everyone. How does a (premium) increase make it better? 
That is the question the President should ask himself. Ending cost-shar-ing hurts people, not insurance compa-nies. Restoring cost sharing will help people, not insurance companies. Sen-ators A
LEXANDER and M URRAY have made sure of it. I have talked to them about their language. It is good lan-guage, well intended. Maybe we can make it better. If the President has a suggestion, we welcome it, but as it is, it is pretty strong. Well-intentioned Members on both sides should continue to sign their names onto this bill. I believe it has significant support within my caucus, and if Leader MCCONNELL puts it on the floor of the Senate, I am pretty certain it would pass. I urge my Republican colleagues to take a good, hard look at the bill and to cosponsor it. So many of my Repub-lican friends have said: Why can’t we be more bipartisan? This is a bipar-tisan agreement. It wasn’t one party coming up with something and telling the other to be for it, as too often hap-pens in this Chamber. It was done to-gether by the chair of the HELP Com-mittee and the ranking Democrat of the HELP Committee. It is truly bipar-tisan, and it is a good way for us to go forward and set a metaphor for future bipartisanship. Mr. President, now on the budget, today the Senate will vote on more amendments to the GOP budget resolu-tion, which increases deficits by $1.5 trillion, slashes Medicare and Medicaid by $1.5 trillion, and sets up this awful, partisan process—the same one our Re-publican friends used in healthcare. The Democrats could have offered an unlimited number of amendments on the bill, but this bill is so bad that we didn’t want to be all over the lot. We wanted to focus on a few issues where we know the American people are over-whelmingly with us, not with the lan-guage in the bill. Here is some of what we are doing. We are going to make our colleagues say that they want to vote to increase the deficit by $1.5 trillion. After 8 years of crowing about debts and deficits under a Democratic President, the Re-publican deficit hawks seem to have flown the coop. This budget is going to increase the deficit by $1.5 trillion. Our amendment would say: No, it should be deficit neutral. We have heard that for the last 8 years. Whenever a spending program comes about, I know our side says that spending programs grow the economy; their side says that tax cuts grow the economy. But if there is going to be an actual deficit, we should vote for it. Put your convictions where your votes are. We are also going to make our Re-publican colleagues vote on whether they want to raise taxes on the middle class. The President claims that his tax plan will cut taxes, but it actually will raise them on millions of hard- working families. Today our Repub-lican colleagues will decide whether they want to support those tax in-creases or protect the middle class from paying more taxes. We are going to make our Republican colleagues vote on their specific pro-posal to eliminate the State and local deduction. Nearly one-third of all tax-payers take the deduction—red States,

blue States, everyone in between. As the chairman of the Finance Com-mittee knows, 35 percent of Utahns take the State and local deduction. It goes right to the heart of the middle class and upper middle class, giving families tens of thousands of dollars in deductions so taxes are lower. The elimination of State and local deduct-ibility is a sure sign that the Repub-lican tax plan does not favor the mid-dle class. In fact, AP reported yesterday that, according to experts, the GOP tax plan may still allow corporations to claim State and local deductibility but not individuals. Did you hear that? Cor-porations can claim it, but individuals can’t. Isn’t that backward? It shouldn’t be taken away from either one. What the GOP plan takes away from individ-uals and families, it makes sure re-mains for big corporations. So today Democrats will ask our Re-publican friends to vote on our amend-ment, led by Senators C
ANTWELL and V
ANHOLLEN , to protect State and local deductibility for middle-class families. Senator C
APITO has an alternative amendment that is incredibly vague and leaves the door open to eliminating State and local. It doesn’t say it will, but it leaves it open. That is why a co-alition of groups, including the Na-tional Governors Association, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, and organiza-tions representing firefighters, teach-ers, and sheriffs have just come out against Senator C
APITO ’s amendment. Senator C
ANTWELL and V ANHOLLEN ’s amendment, by contrast, is crystal clear: no elimination of State and local. I hope my Republican friends won’t vote to raise taxes on so many of their middle-class residents. Mr. President, finally, every morning I hear my friends the majority leader and the chairman of the Finance Com-mittee talk about the need for tax re-form because the middle class is stuck in a rut and the economy isn’t working the way it should for American fami-lies. I agree with that assessment. We need to do more to grow the economy, create jobs, raise wages, and put money in the pockets of average Americans, but when you hear the details of the plan they have to solve those problems, your head spins. Lower the tax rate on big corporations and the top 1 percent, repeal the estate tax, which goes only to estates of over $5 million, and elimi-nate critical middle-class tax breaks like State and local deductibility. In what world does that deliver middle- class tax relief or solve the problems we are talking about? It is the same game they played with healthcare: Complain about high pre-miums, deductibles, counties without enough insurers, and then each Repub-lican bill exacerbates the problem. The Republicans slide in their favor-ite solution—tax cuts for the rich—as the answer to every ill. If the economy is doing well, Republicans push tax cuts for the rich. If the economy is doing poorly, Republicans push for tax cuts for the rich. If our healthcare sys-tem needs to be improved, tax cuts for the rich. It is entirely divorced from the real problems in the economy and our society. Our economy suffers from massive in-equality, which is growing, with a con-centration of wealth at the very apex of our country’s elite. The rich are doing well in America. God bless them; I am glad they are. American corpora-tions are recording record-high profits. Look at the stock market, which re-flects that. God bless them too. We hope they do well. But looking at the GOP tax plan, the American people have to wonder, is now the time to tilt the scales even further in favor of big corporations and the very rich? I be-lieve the American people will reject that approach soundly and roundly, and after the amendment votes today, the American people will have a much clearer picture of what the Republican budget and tax plan is about. There is still a chance to turn back from this budget and the one-party leg-islating that has stymied this Con-gress. I urge my colleagues on the Re-publican side to reject this budget. Come work with Democrats, and we can produce real, successful, bipartisan tax reform. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. If no one yields time, the time will be charged equally to both sides. The Senator from Alaska. Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I know the Presiding Officer and all of our colleagues and those watching today know that we have been focused on the budget resolution. It is a very important document for the country, for the Senate, and for the Congress. There are a lot of big issues that we are all focused on, but there is one I wish to talk about this morning that relates to the budget document. Actually, to be perfectly frank, it relates to a num-ber of the speeches made by my col-leagues on the other side of the aisle. They have been coming down to the floor and talking about issues related to energy, which is really important for America, the environment, which is also very important to America, and— a little bit to my surprise, from all of these experts coming to the floor— Alaska, which is my State. I am going to say a little bit more about what some of my colleagues have been talking about—my State. There seems to be a few experts on Alaska from States like Massachusetts and Or-egon. I just want to put things in per-spective from a Senator who is actu-ally from the State and not these other Senators who, to be honest, don’t know much about what they are talking about. The one thing you are seeing is that it is for sure that you know there is kind of an issue in the debate on the floor when you see talking points that are just stale—talking points that, if you took a speech from 30 or 40 years ago, are the same talking points. They are stale talking points from the other side of the aisle that have been used for decades, that haven’t been updated or that don’t reflect what has really been happening in the country in terms of technological advances, environmental standards, and one of the most impor-tant things that has happened in Amer-ica over the last decade, and that is the American energy renaissance—the American energy renaissance. I know some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle don’t even like to talk about it. They don’t like to ac-knowledge it: As to energy, we don’t produce that in America. Yes, we do. Yes, we do. We are doing it really, real-ly well, and it is benefiting millions and millions and millions of Americans in every State in the country. The budget resolution that we are de-bating has a provision in it that is real-ly simple. I bet if you polled it with every American—Democrat, Repub-lican, people watching on TV—it prob-ably has a 90-percent approval. There is a simple instruction in the budget resolution that says that Con-gress needs to look at ways to increase Federal revenues by increasing Amer-ican energy production. What could be wrong with increasing American en-ergy production? That provision that we are actually debating right now should be very bi-partisan. Who is against that? Who could be against that? Why is this so important? Why is the American en-ergy renaissance so important? Well, as the Presiding Officer knows, because his State is certainly involved in it, the energy renaissance that is happening in the United States right now is a win, win, win, win, win on al-most every category you can imagine. What do I mean by the energy renais-sance? Right now in our great Nation with our resources, we are producing more oil, more natural gas, and more renewables than any other place in the world. That is really good for the coun-try. That is the renaissance. That is really a revolution in energy produc-tion. It is something that you would think on the Senate floor should be completely bipartisan. Unfortunately, it isn’t. Let me talk a little bit about how this energy renaissance and what is in the budget resolution will produce more energy for America by Ameri-cans, which is good for the country. Let’s count the ways. When I said win, win, win, win, win, I wasn’t joking. The wins are all on the board. First, there is energy security. For our Nation, it is lower cost energy. With the increase in natural gas, we are seeing the drop in the prices of nat-ural gas for homes and manufacturers and increasing manufacturing. These are enormously important for our Na-tion. There is economic growth and jobs. In the energy sector, these are good jobs. The Presiding Officer has a lot of these jobs in his State. I have a lot of these jobs in my State. These are real-ly important jobs. When you look at

the weak economic growth in the United States over the last 10 years, the one sector that is actually driving growth has been the energy sector. How about the trade deficit? It is a big problem. Everybody has talked about it. The President is very focused on it. We are now starting to export oil and export natural gas. My State has been exporting natural gas for over four decades. That helps our trade def-icit. Then, when you look at the Federal budget deficit, energy is a huge posi-tive impact on the Federal budget def-icit. That is what the budget resolution asks Congress to do in terms of policy: Let’s produce more energy so we can produce more revenue for the Federal Government. That is a good idea. No-body should be opposed to that. Mr. President, as you know, when we are the world’s energy superpower, as we are, that really helps our national security. It really helps our foreign policy. A lot of Americans have been concerned for decades that we have troops in the Middle East, that we have troops in areas where energy is really important. Well, let’s produce it here. I was in a meeting last year at the Munich Security Conference with the great Senator from Arizona and many of my colleagues. It was bipartisan. Senator M
CCAINled that codel to the Munich Security Conference in Ger-many. We met with a very prominent Russian dissident who has been fight-ing and battling with Vladimir Putin. At the very end of the meeting, we asked a simple question: What more can we do in the United States to help somebody like you, who is battling against a dictator who doesn’t have our interest at heart? Do you know what this very smart Russian official, a cou-rageous man, said? He said: America needs to produce more energy. That is how you take down the leadership in the Kremlin—more energy. This is national security. Let me say one more thing that doesn’t get talked about a lot. It is not just helpful in all of these areas. When the United States of America is pro-ducing energy, it helps the global envi-ronment. Some people say: Well, wait a minute. A lot of the colleagues on the other side of the aisle come to the floor and kind of insinuate that when our country produces energy, it actually hurts the environment. That is not the case. When the United States produces energy, it actually helps the global en-vironment. Why is that the case? Let me just pause for a minute because, like I said, a lot of my colleagues are coming to the floor and talking about Alaska, en-ergy, and the environment. Again, it is not with a lot of knowledge. They are stale talking points, yes. They have been using them for 40 years. Literally, I think one of my colleagues has been in the Congress plus or minus 40 years and has been using the same talking points on this. As somebody who came to the Senate previously from a job as attorney gen-eral and a commissioner of natural re-sources and energy in Alaska, I know a little bit about this topic. I can tell you two important points. My colleagues talk a little bit about Alaska, the environment, and energy. First, Senator MURKOWSKI and I care a lot more about the environment, the wildlife, the pristine wilderness in our great, amazing State than any other Member in this body. I don’t need Sen-ators coming down from places like Massachusetts, Oregon, Washington, Vermont, and Rhode Island talking about Alaska’s environment. OK? Thanks. I don’t need it. I care way more than any of them. With all due respect, I know a heck of a lot more about it than any of them. I also know this. In my State—and, I believe, in most of the country, but particularly in Alaska—Democrats, Re-publicans, Alaskan Natives, and non- Natives certainly support the highest standards on the environment, but we also support responsible resource de-velopment. Here is the key issue: We know we can do both. You can protect the pristine, amazing Alaskan environ-ment, and you can responsibly develop our resources. Let’s talk about how we do this. Let’s talk about how this applies to Alaska and how this applies to the rest of the country in general. As I mentioned, this is a really im-portant point. We have the highest standards on developing our resources and our energy than anywhere in the world, and we have some of the most technologically advanced and sustain-able ways to develop resources in the energy sector. That allows us to do what I just mentioned, which is to pro-tect the environment and to develop our resources. Here is a really important point that a lot of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle miss. They come down here, and this is what they talk about—by the way, they were in alli-ance with the last administration: How do we shut down energy development? How do we make it harder? How do we delay it? As I mentioned, I was attorney gen-eral and the DNR commissioner in Alaska for almost 6 years of the Obama administration. It was all about how to shut it down in Alaska, how to delay it in Alaska, and how to shut it down in America. This is not what the country wants. This is not what the country needs, and, certainly, it is one issue that is often overlooked. This doesn’t help the global environment, as they claim. It doesn’t. Why is that? Because when you chase away investment in places like Alaska, with the highest standards on the environment in the world, what does that do? That drives capital and that drives investment to places like Russia, Iran, and Brazil, whose standards are so much lower than ours. Russians on the tundra in the Arctic don’t care anything about their envi-ronment. In my State and in the rest of America, we do. I don’t need to remind people that Russia and Iran right now are certainly our adversaries. Yet the policies that some of my colleagues like to promote, and certainly the last administration promoted, are to drive away invest-ment, drive away energy production in America, with the highest standards in the world, so the Russians and the Ira-nians can take the capital and produce energy. They do not have high stand-ards on the environment, and they are our adversaries. It makes no sense—no sense. So how do we do this in Alaska? What are the environmental standards that almost no other place in the world—maybe Norway, maybe, to some degree, Canada—uses? What is the technology that enables us to produce American energy, with American jobs, with the American people, with the highest standards in the world? Let me provide a few examples. First, what I want everybody here to be aware of is, do not believe these doomsday sce-narios. Don’t believe the misinformed commentary. When my Democratic colleagues come to the floor, with very little knowledge about what is really happening in this sector, don’t believe it. When they come to the floor and talk about a State like mine—Alaska— about which they know next to noth-ing, don’t believe it. Let me give one infamous example. In the 1970s, we were debating in the Senate—and I think one of my col-leagues was maybe here then, probably using the same talking points—the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, one of the greatest energy infrastructure projects in the history of the world: 800 miles, 16 billion barrels of oil; at one point, 2 million barrels a day, from Americans, in America. The people who were against it came to the floor and said: Oh, no. The Cen-tral Arctic caribou herd is going to be decimated if you do this—these beau-tiful animals that we care so much about in Alaska. Those were the argu-ments right on this floor. So what hap-pened to the Central Arctic caribou? Again, we care about these animals way more than anybody else does in this body. In 1975, we had about 5,000 caribou; today, 66,000. I don’t think the herd was decimated. We haven’t heard that from anybody because they don’t know, but that is the kind of doomsday scenario we heard from people with no knowledge, and then, when it doesn’t happen, we don’t hear them on the Sen-ate floor saying: Oh, we were wrong about that. Let me talk just briefly about some of what we do to make sure we do this in the most responsible way in the world. First, in the energy business, one thing we do is we explore. Again, in Alaska we have the highest standards in the world. A lot of other places in the United States have these stand-ards. In the Arctic, we have what is called no impact exploration. What does that mean? It means we literally do everything to make sure there is no

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES6598 October 19, 2017 
impact on these great species like the polar bear. Again, we care a lot more about our animals than my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. What does no impact exploration mean? Well, we undertake exploration required by State standards—these are not Federal standards—where we essen-tially have what are called ice roads and ice pads. Let me show my col-leagues what that means. We only allow for exploration in the winter on the tundra. When an exploration crew comes out, they have to build an ice road—it is a road made of ice—over the tundra. This photograph is an example of an ice road. Then they do explo-ration on an ice pad. They have drills, and they do all this work on the ice, on the tundra. They have about 4 months to do it and then they are done and then they leave. What does the tundra look like after that exploration on ice? Right here. This is just one capped exploration well. It is as though nobody was even there—literally zero impact. These are Alaska standards, the highest in the world. They are expensive, yes, but we do it because we care so much about the environment. That is the explo-ration phase. How about the production phase? What has happened in the production phase? The innovations in technology, many of which have occurred in my State, have made it so the surface foot-print—when we actually put together a production pad—has shrunk dramati-cally. When we look at this chart, we see Prudhoe Bay in the 1970s. The other developments in Alaska include Kuparuk, Alpine, and Liberty. What happens is, the surface footprint has shrunk dramatically to 11, 12 acres now. Yet the ability to horizontally drill extends the reach of these wells underneath the ground, where we can reach resources in an incredibly vast manner without impacting the envi-ronment at all. If a rig was placed right here on the Capitol Building, in terms of horizontal drilling, it could extend out to Andrews Air Force Base in Southeast, Silver Spring, MD, to the north, and well into Fairfax County—miles and miles and miles. Yet the surface footprint—the impact on the environment—is mini-mal. That is what we do. We don’t hear about it from the other side of the aisle, but it is really important, as we debate these issues, that all Americans know this. More energy for the country is really positive. In conclusion, tonight the budget res-olution is not just going to be a vehicle for tax reform, but there is also, as I mentioned, going to be an instruction for increased revenues for the country for more American energy production. It is a simple instruction. As I mentioned, this should be very noncontroversial. What could be wrong with more energy production, particu-larly in a State like mine, where the standards are the highest in the world, and the technology is the most ad-vanced in the world. What could be controversial about more energy pro-duction? More energy production means more American jobs, more American economic growth, more American national security, more American energy security, decreased Federal budgets and trade deficits, and a more sustainable global environment because no one in the world produces energy more responsibly than Ameri-cans, especially Alaskans. Nevertheless, some of my Democratic colleagues will be putting forth an amendment that does just the opposite. Think about that, an amendment that says let’s kill energy production, there-by undermining American job growth, good jobs, American economic growth, American national security and energy security, while increasing our budget and trade deficits and harming the global environment. That is a lose- lose-lose scenario to me, but that is what is at stake tonight. Later this afternoon, when we debate that amendment—and I certainly ask all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to reject any attempts to not take advantage of this incredible op-portunity in America—the American energy renaissance that we need to continue—and this afternoon we are going to have an opportunity to do that. Thank you. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Virginia. 
NUCLEAR AGREEMENT WITH IRAN  
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the President’s action last week stepping away from certifying Iran’s compliance with the nuclear deal that was negotiated between the U.S. allies and the nation of Iran. National security is about military power, but there is more to it than that. America’s strength also comes from the power to use diplomacy. In October 1945, President Harry Tru-man, my favorite President, changed the seal of the Office of the President to have the eagle face the olive branches of diplomacy instead of the arrows of war, signifying that America would also prefer that we use diplo-macy first. In modern times, our judg-ments to go to war rather than use di-plomacy have been flawed. Under this administration, diplomacy, in my view, is under assault, and that is why I rise today. We see a decimated State in the USAID budget. We see bellicose rhet-oric from the President. We see efforts to undermine, publicly, American dip-lomats engaged in negotiations. We see the refusal to even nominate key State Department diplomatic appointees. As of last week, the administration has not put forward a nominee for ap-proximately 52 percent of high-level positions at the State Department that require approval by the Senate. Thirty- two countries do not yet have Ambas-sadors in place, and that includes no nomination from the White House for Ambassadors to key countries like South Korea, Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar. No one has been nominated for Assistant Secretary for Arms Control, for Assistant Secretary for International Security and Non-proliferation, for Assistant Secretary for Near Eastern Affairs, Assistant Secretary for South and Central Asian Affairs, or for East Asian and Pacific Affairs. How serious can the administration be about nuclear threats with no Am-bassador to South Korea or no ambas-sadorial nomination for the key State Department official around non-proliferation? And the President has repeatedly undercut his Secretary of State’s diplomatic efforts with North Korea. President Trump’s most recent ac-tion—his recent attack on diplomacy— is the decision to decertify the Iran deal, and I think this could be the most dangerous yet. By stepping back from a diplomatic deal that the United States made with the global community that is clearly working, the President is publicly undercutting diplomatic nego-tiations, and he is setting us on a road where military options become increas-ingly more likely. I will state it blunt-ly. If you weaken diplomacy, you raise the risk of unnecessary war, and that is what this President is doing. First, President Trump’s refusal to make the Iran certification and his threat to abandon the nuclear deal with Iran recalls the disastrous U.S. entrance into the Iraq war in 2003, where intelligence was politicized, and the administration repeatedly made false claims to justify going to war—a war of choice—to overthrow Saddam Hussein. The Bush administration insisted that regime change in Iraq was nec-essary, and it insisted on that because of the claim of Iraq’s continuing pro-ductions of weapons of mass destruc-tion. In March of 2003, the IAEA came out and said there was no credible evidence that Iraq had a program of weapons of mass destruction and that there was no evidence they had revived the nuclear program they shelved in the 1990s, but the Bush administration would not ac-cept that claim. It did not fit with the narrative they were selling to the American people about Saddam Hus-sein so they said the IAEA was wrong. They said we needed to initiate war— one that has proven so costly to Vir-ginians and to Americans in treasure and in regional stability but especially in American lives—to prevent Iraq from obtaining weapons of mass de-struction. We went to war. It turned out the sci-entists and the technicians and the IAEA were right. Iraq didn’t have a program of weapons of mass destruc-tion. The politicians who tried to un-dermine the credibility of the inter-national agencies were wrong. Of course, the consequences of that deci-sion are significant. Ironically, you

could claim—I believe there is strong evidence—that decision in 2003 has today led to greater Iranian influence in Iraq and the region and a prolifera-tion of extremist groups that didn’t exist before. We are now hearing the Trump ad-ministration make similar claims about Iran; that Iran will soon enough have a nuclear weapons program, that the IAEA cannot be trusted, that Iran supports al-Qaida, and from a Repub-lican colleague: ‘‘The policy of the United States should be regime change in Iran,’’ and from Secretary of State Tillerson, we need a ‘‘peaceful transi-tion’’ of the Iranian Government. We should stop to think, Is this real-ly about the nuclear deal or is it about beginning a drumbeat from the admin-istration to march the United States toward another preventable war in the Middle East? Second, while threatening to unilat-erally terminate the nuclear deal at any time, President Trump also wants to revisit the terms of the deal to ad-dress what he sees as its flaws. This isn’t new. Since the day the deal was announced, some critics have ar-gued that we could get a better deal or push for an alternative. I wasn’t then, nor am I now, interested in the world of hypotheticals. I am interested in the world of facts. The fact is, the deal is working, and it is dramatically better than the alternative for at least 15 years or possibly longer. Additionally, if we want to renego-tiate the deal, Iran will seek to do the same. If we take a step back from the deal, Iran will take a step back, and what will they ask for—that they get to now increase centrifuges or get some of their enriched uranium back? I don’t want to give Iran one thing back from this deal, but if we step back from a deal that is working and say we want to renegotiate, they will, too, and I don’t think we should tolerate that. Most wars start because of mis-calculations. The notion that we can renegotiate the deal just on our side and the other side wouldn’t think of re-negotiation is magical thinking. The U.S. entrance in World War I 100 years ago started with miscalculations— most nations do. A miscommunication, a misunderstanding, another step, an-other step, and you are at war. We should be very, very wary. I and all of us are very willing to go after Iran on the nonnuclear front. It was just 2 months ago that we passed— I think unanimously; maybe there was one ‘‘no’’ vote in this body—a set of stiff sanctions against Iran, North Korea, and Russia. We have given the power to the President to impose more sanctions on Iran for bellicose behav-ior, for activities in other countries, for violations of human rights, and for violating U.N. Security Council resolu-tions on their missile program. The President should use the sanctions power we just gave him to go after Iran’s activities that violate inter-national norms and make America less safe. But when the IAEA, our allies, the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Secretary of Defense, and the Sec-retary of State all say that with re-spect to the nuclear deal, Iran is com-plying, we should avoid stepping back on that deal, lest we suggest that the United States cannot be trusted in good faith to follow a deal. Third, I worry about the timing of this effort to step away from the Iran deal with respect to the imminent threat. I hear concerns about the Iran deal and what Iran might be able to do in year 8 or year 10 or year 15. Let me tell you about something I am wor-rying about this month, and that is the North Korean nuclear program. We have been in briefings, and we hear the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of State say to us and say to the world: The United States will al-ways push for a diplomatic solution. We are never out of diplomatic solu-tions. But let’s be candid. What are the chances of a diplomatic solution with North Korea that would end or dra-matically limit their nuclear weapons ambitions? I don’t think the chances are high. I would say they are 20 per-cent at best. They are not zero, but they are not high, either. But if there is any chance of a diplomatic negotia-tion and a diplomatic end to this pro-gram, don’t we owe it to the American public and don’t we owe it to our troops to seek to exhaust and explore it? Of course we do. Yet every time Secretary of State Tillerson talks about trying to have some diplomatic outcome to pressure the Chinese to use leverage against North Korea, the President pours cold water on him. I would argue that stepping back from the Iran deal sends an unmistak-able signal to North Korea if I am right, and there is even a small chance of a diplomatic resolution. But the message we send to North Korea is that the United States will back out of a nuclear deal even when it is being com-plied with. I think we drive the chances of a diplomatic resolution with North Korea down to zero, and we should not do that. There is significant evidence that while Iran’s nonnuclear behavior is worthy of additional sanctions and pressure, the deal on the nuclear pro-gram is working. Our closest European allies, U.S. intelligence services, the IAEA, the P5—when I visit Israel and speak to national security and intel-ligence leaders, such as Gadi Eisenkot, who is essentially the equivalent of the head of our Joint Chiefs of Staff, they say Iran is complying with the deal, and it is making the world safer in the near and medium term. Secretary Dunford and General Mattis have said the same thing. The deal gives us more intelligence because we have inspections that we didn’t have before. We have more in-spections, and we know more about their program. In the first paragraph of the deal, on the first page of the deal, Iran pledges to never purchase, ac-quire, or develop military weapons. That promise, which is in perpetuity, gives us a legal justification, if they ever break it, to take action, including military action, to punish them for violating what they have signed. Do we want to give Iran the ability to step back from that promise they have made by stepping back ourselves when the deal is working? Finally, the deal gives us a coalition. Our partners around the world who have signed on to the deal, who have been witness to the Iranian pledge, who know that Iran will have to perma-nently comply with the additional pro-tocol of inspections under the deal—if we move away from the deal and Iran moves away from the deal, could we count on the coalition partners being with us to try to put a deal back to-gether when it is we alone among the partners who have walked away from the table? What coalition could we ex-pect if we are the ones who walk away from the table, if we say we are not in-terested in diplomacy? Then, later, if we need to take military action against Iran after we walked away from a deal, could we expect a coali-tion to support us in that? I would like to conclude in this way: I think the President’s decision to step back from this diplomatic deal poses a real challenge for this Congress. The President has done some things I agree with. He has done a number of things I disagree with. He has done only one thing that scares me, and it is this. I think that, together with defunding the State Department and pouring cold water on diplomacy and not filling key posts, this leads us closer to an unnec-essary war. When you reject diplomacy or weaken it, you run the risk of an un-necessary war. I have had to cast two war votes in the Senate, both as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. I have been a city councilman, a mayor, a Lieutenant Governor, and a Gov-ernor, and casting a war vote is dif-ferent from any vote you ever have to cast—any vote you ever have to cast. I have a son in the military, and that makes that vote different from any vote I have cast in 23 years in public life. As a Member of Congress, I may have to cast other votes to go to war against other nations, whether against nonstate terrorist groups or against a nation like North Korea or even Iran if they break for nuclear weapons. If I have to cast that vote, if I have to con-template putting Congress on record that we should go to war, I want to be able to look American troops in the face and say: I exhausted every diplo-matic option before I cast this vote. I think that is an obligation we owe to the public and to our troops. We have to exhaust diplomacy. There may come a time when that eagle just cannot face the olive branches of diplomacy, but we have to insist on military strength to keep order in the world and protect Ameri-cans. But if we turn to those arrows of

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES6600 October 19, 2017 
war, we should be able to look at our public and look at our troops and say we exhausted diplomacy. Stepping away from a diplomatic deal that is working is exactly the wrong thing for us to do at this time. It is my hope that Congress will not dignify what the President is doing in this regard and that we will insist, yes, upon strict compliance and also insist upon sanctions against Iran for non-nuclear behavior. But let’s not be a na-tion that refuses to keep its diplomatic commitments. The stakes are just too high. Mr. President I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. S
UL-
LIVAN ). The Senator from South Caro-lina. Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I wish to take a few minutes to support the effort to pass the fiscal year 2018 budg-et resolution. I am on the Budget Com-mittee, and I am pretty familiar with the document. It provides a pathway to balance. It actually has a $197 billion surplus in 2027, and it allows for tax cuts. To Republicans—and Democrats too; you are welcome to join—the only way we are ever going to meaningfully get a tax cut is to pass a budget reconcili-ation instruction. This budget allows us to cut taxes. I hope some Democrats will join us, but if they choose not to, we can do it with a simple majority. If we don’t pass this budget, we can’t cut taxes unless we get 60 votes. With our friends on the other side—I think it is going to be hard to get any Democrats for a meaningful tax cut. They are not bad people; they just see things dif-ferently. When they spend money, they think that is good. They don’t worry about the deficit. When we cut taxes, the deficit is the most important thing. My belief is that not only will we not have a deficit, we will actually have a surplus because this budget does two things: It restrains spending by $5.1 trillion over the next decade, and it ac-tually creates a system for tax cuts to spur economic growth. If we could grow the GDP number by just 1 percent, that would be trillions of dollars of revenue. To those who are interested in this, we have been grow-ing at about 1.9 percent GDP per year over the last 8 years—right around 2, sometimes under, sometimes a bit over. The historical average since World War II has been 3.2. If we could get back to 3.2 percent GDP growth, there would be trillions of dollars com-ing in to the Treasury, and I believe we can. President Trump is trying to deregu-late America after 8 years of heavy reg-ulation, but he can only do so much through Executive order. Senator S
ULLIVAN , the Presiding Offi-cer, talked about the opportunities in Alaska. I have learned a lot about Alaska. There are 750,000 people living in a State twice the size of Texas. It is beautiful as it can be. Environ-mentally, you are very sensitive. That is one of the qualities of Alaska you want to preserve. God has blessed Alas-ka with a lot of natural resources, and it would be good for the people of Alas-ka and the United States as a whole. Every liter of gas and barrel of oil we can extract from Alaska in an environ-mentally sound way is less to buy from people who hate our guts. We are going to be using oil and gas for a long time to come. I want to move to a lower car-bon economy. I think that would be good for the environment and good for our economy. Alaska has been blessed with natural resources, and I think Senator SULLIVAN explained how sen-sitive they are in the extraction proc-ess. But it would be insane to take Alaska oil and gas off the table for America because in that area, Russia is all over the place, and, trust me, they don’t care about the environment. One thing this budget doesn’t do is it doesn’t change the Budget Control Act caps. There is one member of our cau-cus who claims that this budget is somehow fiscally irresponsible. It is not. It actually leads to a surplus. There is nothing in this budget that allows for more defense spending. The overseas contingency operations ac-count is money set aside for our mili-tary and State Department to deal with the wars we are fighting that are not part of the Budget Control Act. We have been doing that for years. So for anybody to suggest that this author-izes an explosion of spending on the de-fense side—you literally don’t know what you are talking about. If you looked at the details of the budget, you would find that it cuts spending by $5.1 trillion and actually has a $197 billion surplus 10 years from now. But I want to let the body know—and the Presiding Officer will be right in that fight—that I, along with Senator M
CCAIN, President Trump, General Mattis, Senator S
ULLIVAN , Senator B
LUNT , and many others, am going to do everything I can to give the mili-tary more resources to fight wars we can’t afford to lose. I look forward to this debate with some of my colleagues on the other side and a few on this side. Really, is it smart to have the small-est Navy since 1950? Is it really smart to have an Army 1940s-size given what is going on in the world, having fighter squadrons grounded not because the enemy shot us down but because the Congress shot us down? We are spending about 3.2 percent of GDP on defense. Historically, since World War II, it has been about 5. Tell me how you justify spending that much less today given the world we have to deal with. Where is the peace dividend? Since 2011, when sequestration was passed, the world has deteriorated. President Trump is promising to re-build the military, give them the capa-bility they need to keep the enemies at bay and not fight wars with one hand tied behind their back. So I will be working with Senator M
CCAIN and many others to make sure that our military is replenished; that we do have a 350-ship Navy, not 278; that we have an Army consistent with the threats—about 520,000 versus 420,000. The No. 1 job of the Congress and the Federal Government is to defend the Nation. That is a different debate. That is not part of the budget. The budget resolution doesn’t change defense spending caps. Hopefully, we can do that later, working with our Demo-cratic friends. This is the last best chance we will have to cut taxes. If this budget resolu-tion fails, the ability to cut taxes on President Trump’s watch goes away. To those of you on the Republican side who have been claiming that we need tax cuts and a simpler tax code, this is your chance. If we don’t succeed now, we are going to fail for the entire term of President Trump. That will be the end of us as a party, because if you are a Republican and you don’t want to simplify the Tax Code and cut taxes, what good are you to anybody? Our friends on the other side have really invested in ‘‘the government.’’ Somebody needs to be involved in American politics who would actually like to send more money to you and less money to the government in a re-sponsible way. So I hope we are going to cut the cor-porate tax rate to make us competi-tive. We are going to double the stand-ard exemptions so working people will have more money in their pockets. We are going to clean up some of the de-ductions and exemptions for the few at the expense of the many. But we can only do that if we pass a budget resolu-tion. A final thought. From the Repub-lican Party point of view, we have the House, the Senate, and the Presidency. We have nobody to blame in this exer-cise but ourselves. If you are a Repub-lican and you are frustrated with the lack of progress, count me in. The President is a willing partner to help us repeal and replace ObamaCare and to get a healthy tax cut to grow an economy that is dying to grow. But we have to help ourselves. If we can’t muster the votes nec-essary to pass this budget resolution to cut your taxes, then everybody who supported us for all these years should feel let down, and we will have let you down. I hope that doesn’t happen. I am confident it won’t. But to those Repub-licans who believe that a ‘‘no’’ vote is good for the future of conservatism and the future of the economic well-being of the country, I could not disagree with you more. You will never balance the budget by dealing with discre-tionary spending alone. We are at 2008 levels of discretionary spending. What balances the budget is entitlement re-form. If you want to balance the budg-et, vote for Graham-Cassidy because it finally puts Medicaid on a sustainable path. We have to deal with our entitlement problem, but that is not in this budget reconciliation instruction. This in-struction allows us to cut taxes with a

majority-only vote and gets to balance or a surplus in 2027. From a Republican point of view, this is the most important vote we are going to cast in 2017. If we fail, that is the end of this party’s ability to grow. All of those who worked hard to get us here are going to be disappointed, and they should be. We are not going to disappoint you. We are going to pass this budget reso-lution. We are going to cut your taxes, and we are eventually going to rebuild and replace ObamaCare, which is fail-ing, with a block grant that gets the money and power closer to where you live, in the hands of the people you can vote for. We are going to succeed. With that, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Missouri. Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, let me first agree with the point that the Sen-ator from South Carolina just made about the importance of passing a tax bill this year. He made the point—and if he didn’t, I will make it—that if we don’t pass a tax bill this year or at least get most of the way there—I hope we get done with this tax process this year. If we don’t get that done, I think we won’t have another opportunity to pass a tax bill in the next 4 years. On the other hand, if we do pass a tax bill this year, we will have the incen-tive to take a second look in 2019, maybe 2020, but probably in 2019. The point I am making is, we don’t have to do everything that could possibly be done to improve the Tax Code this year to take an important step. But if we don’t take that important step, my be-lief is we are likely not going to have the kind of tax relief that working families need in the next 4 years. So not only is the pressure on the Repub-lican Senate, the Republican House, and a White House that wants to work with us to get this done, but the pres-sure should be on everyone who cares about hard-working families. And the pressure should be on everyone who wants to see tax relief for those fami-lies happen. We need to understand that it needs to happen now. Fights that can’t be won in the next few weeks can be won in this Presi-dential term but only if we take this step successfully right now. As the Senator from South Carolina and oth-ers have pointed out, this is an impor-tant two-step process. The first step is a budget that allows us to move forward so that we can do this under the budget rules and allow 51 Senators to pass a bill on tax re-form. By the way, they don’t have to be 51 Republicans. I suspect that is what will happen, but once we get to 51 Re-publicans, I would love to see Demo-crats join us. I would love to see them join us before that. This is the kind of help that hard- working families need—families who, for 9 years, were stuck in a situation where their buying power wasn’t in-creasing, their job opportunities weren’t increasing. They generally were not seeing that better job out there that was largely available to those very same hard-working families in the past because we aren’t as com-petitive as we need to be. There ought to be a couple of things we focus on. One is, how do you create tax relief for working families right now so that, as soon as possible, they begin to see a check that has more take-home pay? The other way to in-crease take-home pay is to increase starting pay, to make those jobs bet-ter. That is where we need to be look-ing on the other end of the spectrum. On the end that creates jobs, what do we need to do to make ourselves more competitive? What do we need to do to constantly have the kind of pressure on the working job market that allows people who are working hard for a liv-ing to have better opportunities than they would have otherwise because we are more competitive than we would be otherwise? I think the entire focus of this dis-cussion should be, what do we do that improves the opportunities and im-proves the future for hard-working families? You can do that with a tax cut right now, which we should do. You can do that with policies that make more sense as we try to compete with the people we compete with around the world. You can’t have the highest corporate tax in the entire world and assume you are going to be the most competitive country in the entire world. You can’t have a tax system that is uniquely dif-ferent as it relates to products you sell overseas and expect to be more com-petitive than the countries who don’t have that unique system, which penal-izes rather than encourages American products to be sold in other places. The Senate will vote later today on a budget resolution that reduces Federal spending by $5 trillion over 10 years, provides a stronger foundation for eco-nomic growth, and allows us to move forward in the first, necessary legisla-tive step in the Senate so that we can then move immediately to tax policy. This is a budget that will allow us to reduce taxes by $1.5 trillion over 10 years, a budget that would put more money in the pockets of hard-working families, a budget that would add some opportunity to that struggle where, for almost a decade now, things haven’t seemed to be getting better or easier. They seemed to be getting more dif-ficult because we were less competitive and there was less pressure to find the workforce to do the jobs that need to be done. And then this is a tax code that will make it simpler and fairer and more uniformly impactful on ev-eryone who pays taxes. Most people don’t mind paying taxes on the income they have until they find out that their neighbor next door with the same income has figured out how not to pay taxes. There is a reason American families and American busi-nesses can’t get through April without a bottle of aspirin. There is a reason this Tax Code creates headache after headache. There is one estimate that individ-uals and businesses complying with the complicated tax system we have costs $267 billion a year. That is half of the defense budget. If people are spending half of the defense budget just to com-ply with the Tax Code, there has to be something wrong with that, and we can do better. I think the proposals we are talking about will do a better job. Right now, the individual Tax Code has seven different brackets—seven rates—and you have to figure out how they apply to whatever income you have had. It has 100 different credits, deductions, exclusions, and other pro-visions that make it extremely dif-ficult to know what you owe or when you are going to owe what you owe. According to the American Action Forum, the IRS currently imposes 8.1 billion hours of paperwork on Ameri-cans, which amounts to about 54 hours per taxpayer who is paying taxes. It is more for some, less for some, but a week’s worth of work—54 hours of work—for taxpayers who pay their taxes. Every taxpayer gives that week to the Federal Government. We are streamlining the Tax Code, increasing the basic deduction that families can have. If they don’t want to go through the complicated Tax Code— here is how many of us there are who live at our house. Here is the basic de-duction we get for each of those people living at our house. Here is how much we subtract from the money we make. Here is how much we need to pay. There is no reason that one of the compliance options can’t be a postcard or a piece of paper. In fact, when the current income tax was imposed on the American people, the entire set of in-structions were on one page—the entire set of instructions for everyone who had to fill out the income tax form— with the assurance that only the rich-est people would ever pay any income tax, so most Americans would never have had to read that instruction sheet at all. Now most Americans find it almost impossible to read the 100 pages of in-structions that just get them to the Tax Code itself. Streamlining the Tax Code, helping families keep more of their money, figuring out a way we can be more competitive so there is oppor-tunity for better jobs in the future, all should be important priorities for this Congress. Passing a budget today will allow us to take the first step, which then al-lows us to take the next step in tax re-lief that matters and makes sense to the American people. We will take that step today. We should take that step today. We should then follow up as quickly as possible to win the fights that can be won this year so Americans can start next year understanding that their Tax Code is simpler, the Tax Code is fairer, and their opportunities are

likely to be greater. But for hard-work-ing families, their take-home pay will definitely be higher than it is today. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Oregon. Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democrats have 4 minutes remaining. 
AMENDMENT NO . 1302 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, yester-day I was at a meeting with the Presi-dent at the White House, along with several members from both sides of the Senate Finance Committee. I said to the President flatout that Democrats agree that the Tax Code is a broken, dysfunctional mess. Finance Demo-crats yesterday laid out to the Presi-dent our principles for reform, focusing on the middle class—not 1 percent—and being fiscally responsible so that Con-gress doesn’t turn around and look at gutting safety-net programs such as Medicare and Medicaid or Social Secu-rity. I think it would be fair to say that a whole lot of ears in that room perked up when the President said: Hey, I am for those kinds of things. The Presi-dent talked to us about wanting help for the middle class. He said that this is not supposed to be about people like him, and he said that he doesn’t want to shred the safety net. Unfortunately, as I have indicated, there are gaps as wide as Crater Lake among all of the administration’s statements, the rhetoric about taxes, and the reality of what is actually written down on paper about its tax cut plan. The Republican plan—this ad-ministration’s plan, which actually is written down on paper, doesn’t resem-ble what the late President Reagan ac-complished in partnership with Demo-crats in 1986. Back then, the two sides brought their best ideas forward and passed major tax reform built around the idea that America is strongest when the middle class is prospering. What is on paper today is just an enor-mous gift to the top of the top—the most fortunate special interests. I hope the Senate, in a few minutes, will vote for my amendment to strike the reconciliation instructions from the budget because budget reconcili-ation is exactly the kind of partisan process, at least for taxes—especially for taxes, given the importance of taxes in this particular budget—budget reconciliation is exactly the kind of approach that President Reagan re-jected in 1986. I hope my colleagues will support my amendment, striking the reconcili-ation instructions from the budget. Senate Democrats have outlined our principles for reform. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator’s time has expired. Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional 30 seconds. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, very quickly, the principles that the Senate Democrats have laid out in our letter are very much in line with what the President says he wants. Now what we have to do is to have a bipartisan proc-ess to advance it. You do not get that with reconciliation. I hope the Senate supports my amendment. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Pennsylvania. Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 2 minutes of debate equally divided prior to each vote in the 11:45 a.m. vote se-ries this morning. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered.

YDEN . The Senator from Oregon. Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I think I have made the case. To my colleagues, what the Amer-ican people have told us—and they cer-tainly said this during this last work period—is that they understand that the big challenges in this country re-quire bipartisan approaches. That is what President Reagan understood when he brought together Democrats and Republicans for comprehensive tax reform. We need to pass this amendment to strike the reconciliation instructions from the budget because they send all of the wrong signals with respect to tax reform. The American people understand what it takes to tackle big issues. They understand that tax reform should be about the middle class. It should not be about the 1 percent, and it should not be about causing a huge, new sea of red ink. I urge my colleagues to support my amendment to strike the reconcili-ation instructions from the budget. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time in opposition? The Senator from Pennsylvania. Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, we have an opportunity today to give ourselves the tool to pass a tax reform bill that will absolutely mean tax relief for mid-dle-income and working-class families and will promote the kind of economic growth that we have been waiting for, but to do it, we are going to have to de-feat this amendment and pass the un-derlying budget. What my friend from Oregon is sug-gesting is that we give a minority in the Senate the opportunity to defeat tax reform by filibuster. That is what would happen if we were to pass this amendment. I have to disagree strongly with the notion that somehow this is not a bi-partisan exercise. There is nothing about reconciliation that in any way discourages or prevents full Demo-cratic participation. We are going to have a markup in the Senate Finance Committee, and there will be unlimited amendment opportunities. If we are able to report something out, then there will be unlimited amendment op-portunities on the floor. There is noth-ing that we could do to stop it if we wanted to because those are the rules of reconciliation. Every Democrat in this body will have an unlimited oppor-tunity to weigh in on this, to influence this, and to amend this, and it will be a fully bipartisan exercise. I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on the amend-ment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amend-ments. Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6603 October 19, 2017 
The Senator from West Virginia. Mrs. CAPITO. Madam President, I call up amendment No. 1393. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report. 
The Senator from West Virginia [Mrs. C AP-
ITO] proposes an amendment numbered 1393 to amendment No. 1116. 
Mrs. CAPITO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the read-ing of the amendment be dispensed with. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To help provide tax relief to mid-dle-class Americans by reducing deduct-ibility, for Federal tax purposes, of federal deductions, such as the state and local tax deduction which disproportionally favors high-income individuals) At the end of title III, add the following: 
SEC. 3 lll. DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND RELATING TO TAX RELIEF FOR HARD-WORKING MIDDLE-CLASS AMERICANS. 
The Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate may revise the alloca-tions of a committee or committees, aggre-gates, and other appropriate levels in this resolution, and make adjustments to the pay-as-you-go ledger, for one or more bills, joint resolutions, amendments, amendments between the Houses, motions, or conference reports relating to changes in Federal tax laws, which may include reducing federal de-ductions, such as the state and local tax de-duction which disproportionally favors high- income individuals, to ensure relief for mid-dle-income taxpayers, by the amounts pro-vided in such legislation for those purposes, provided that such legislation would not in-crease the deficit over either the period of the total of fiscal years 2018 through 2027. 
Mrs. CAPITO. Thank you, Madam President. I would like to speak, for my 1 minute, about this amendment, which prioritizes tax relief for the middle class over the State and local tax de-duction, which disproportionately ben-efits the wealthy and high earners. Only 1 percent of the State and local deduction benefits go to taxpayers who earn less than $50,000 annually. Tax re-form means higher wages, lower taxes for middle-class workers. To unlock these benefits, we must reduce expen-sive deductions that do little to benefit everyday Americans. Keeping the State and local tax deduction without modi-fication would cost more than $1 tril-lion over 10 years. That money would be better spent on relief for the middle class. Middle-class workers will benefit from the enhanced 0-percent bracket, enhanced child tax credit, and lower rates that will be part of this reform. We cannot let an unwillingness to re-duce deductions for the wealthy stand in the way of relief for the middle-class working folks of this great country. I hope my colleagues will join me in prioritizing middle-class families by supporting this amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Oregon. Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I rise in strong opposition to the Capito amendment. More than half the tax-payers claiming the State and local de-duction make less than $100,000. These hard-working, middle-class folks are not going to appreciate Congress dou-ble-taxing them. The fact is, the Capito amendment is Washington lingo that would produce a Republican tax plan that hits the mid-dle class, yet again, with more taxes. Under Capito, you could again have one hand giveth and the other hand taketh away. You might have the Republicans say let’s double the standard deduc-tion, but then when those middle-class folks lose their deduction for State and local taxes and their personal exemp-tions, they are in a big hole. Reject this amendment, reject sleight-of-hand tax policy and those ap-proaches like this that hurt hard-work-ing, middle-class families. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amend-ment. Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient sec-ond. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk called the roll. Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. MENEN -

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 minutes of debate, equally divided, prior to a vote in relation to amend-ment No. 1141, offered by the Senator from Washington, Ms. CANTWELL . Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I call up amendment No. 1141, as pro-vided under the previous order. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report. The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: 
The Senator from Washington [Ms. C ANT-
WELL ] proposes an amendment numbered 1141 to amendment No. 1116. 
Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the read-ing of the amendment be dispensed with. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To create a point of order against legislation that would raise taxes on mid-dle class families by double-taxing income already taxed at the state or local level) At the end of title IV, add the following: 
SEC. 4ll. POINT OF ORDER AGAINST ANY TAX BILL THAT RAISES TAXES ON MID-DLE-CLASS FAMILIES BY ELIMI-NATING OR LIMITING THE STATE AND LOCAL TAX DEDUCTION. 
(a) P OINT OF ORDER .—It shall not be in order in the Senate to consider any bill, joint resolution, motion, amendment, amendment between the Houses, or con-ference report that repeals or limits the State and Local Tax Deduction. (b) W
AIVER AND APPEAL .—Subsection (a) may be waived or suspended in the Senate only by an affirmative vote of three-fifths of the Members, duly chosen and sworn. An af-firmative vote of three-fifths of the Members of the Senate, duly chosen and sworn, shall be required to sustain an appeal of the ruling of the Chair on a point of order raised under subsection (a). 
Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, this amendment simply raises a point of order on any legislation that modi-fies or eliminates State and local tax deductions. I know there are many States that have tax deductions from their Federal obligations on property, but I am specifically talking about States like Washington, Wyoming, Ne-vada, South Dakota, Alaska, Florida, Texas, and Tennessee. We have had the ability to itemize and deduct our sales tax from our Fed-eral income tax. That has resulted in a savings to the taxpayers. Under the President’s proposal of increasing the standard deduction, even for house-holds between $50,000 and $70,000, if you repeal their ability to continue to itemize, even with the standard deduc-tion, you are raising taxes on them. It will not be covered. The standard de-duction is only $12,000. For that brack-et in my State, they are deducting up to $23,000. Please do not raise taxes on our con-stituents without a due process and a budget point of order that says that we are all going to be a part of this proc-ess and discussion before you take away a way for our citizens to save money. I ask my colleagues to support this amendment.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES6604 October 19, 2017 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Wyoming. Mr. ENZI. Madam President, this amendment is corrosive to the budget resolution’s privilege. So it falls out-side the scope of what is appropriate for inclusion. Adoption of corrosive amendments could be fatal to the reso-lution’s privilege, and loss of privilege could compromise our ability to pass tax reform and enforce the budget spending limits. Further, this amend-ment is also nongermane. The Congres-sional Budget Act requires that amend-ments to a budget resolution be ger-mane, which is a statutory require-ment we can’t ignore. So I raise a point of order against this amendment under the Budget Act, section 305(b)(2). The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Washington. Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, pursuant to section 904 of the Congres-sional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive section 305(b)(2) of that act for the purposes of the pending amend-ment, and I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient sec-ond. The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant bill clerk called the roll. Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. M

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. 
HEALTHCARE  
Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, a week ago Saturday night, I was having dinner with my wife. It was about 8:30 in the evening, and the telephone rang, my cell phone, sitting in my pocket. I pulled it out, and it was the White House operator. The President was calling. So I walked out of the res-taurant, sat on a curb outside in the dark, and had about a 15-minute con-versation with the President of the United States while my dinner got cold. President Trump said: I am calling about the cost-sharing reduction pay-ments. I have cut them off as of Octo-ber 1. The court says they are illegal. I don’t want insurance companies to be bailed out. I think I can get block grants to replace ObamaCare, but I don’t want people to suffer in the meantime. So he said to me: I think I might want to get a bipartisan interim deal, a short-term deal. I have called C
HUCK  S
CHUMER and told him that. The President put that out in a tweet that day. So the President said to me: Why don’t you negotiate with Senator M
UR-
RAY and try to get one; meaning a short-term, bipartisan deal. I said: Well, what about the CSR pay-ments? He said: I can put them back, and you can use that as a negotiating tool to get a better deal with the Demo-crats. I responded that I was already work-ing on an agreement with Senator M
URRAY . He said: Finish it, and let me know. He called me again last Saturday. We talked about it again, and we talked twice yesterday. I reported to the President that we finished our negotiations and that we are here today to present to the Senate the agreement we recommend. The bill has 22 sponsors, half Demo-cratic and half Republican—very few bills come to the floor with that many cosponsors originally—and there are a number of others on the Republican side and I understand from Senator M
URRAY a number on the Democratic side who support the idea. I ask unanimous consent that a list of the cosponsors I am about to read be printed in the R
ECORD following my re-marks. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-sent that the text of the agreement that Senator MURRAY and I would like to present to the Senate for its consid-eration and the President’s consider-ation and the consideration of the House of Representatives be printed in the R
ECORD following my remarks. The Republican Senators who are co-sponsoring the Alexander-Murray pro-posal, in addition to me, are Senator R
OUNDS , Senator G RAHAM , Senator M
CCAIN, Senator C ASSIDY , Senator C OL-
LINS, Senator E RNST , Senator M UR-
KOWSKI , Senator B URR, and Senator C
ORKER . I thank them all for doing that. Senator M
URRAY will talk about the equal number of Democratic co-sponsors that we have. We hope Senator M
CCONNELL and Senator S
CHUMER , the President of the United States, and the House of Rep-resentatives will consider our proposal. This is a first step—improve it and pass it, sooner rather than later. Our pur-pose is to stabilize and then lower the cost of premiums in the individual in-surance market for the years 2018 and 2019. In plain English, most Americans get their insurance from the government or on the job. About 6 percent of in-sured Americans, or 18 million Ameri-cans, go into the individual market to buy it. They are the ones we are wor-ried about. They are the ones we are seeking to help. There are 350,000 such people in Tennessee—songwriters, farmers, small business women—they are the ones who are terrified by the prospect of skyrocketing premiums and even the possibility that they might not be able to buy insurance at all. Our agreement tries to help in two ways. No. 1, it permanently amends the Affordable Care Act to give new flexi-bility for States to create insurance policies that have a larger variety and lower costs. No. 2, it continues the cost-sharing reduction payments dur-ing 2018 and 2019. Now, first, about cost-sharing. Cost- sharing reduction payments are sub-sidies that pay for co-pays and deductibles for low-income Americans. That is what they are. Every Democrat wants them to continue, so do many Republicans, including every Repub-lican in the majority in the House who voted for their repeal-and-replace bill this year because it continued the cost- sharing payments for two years. Let me say that again. Every Repub-lican in the House of Representatives who voted to repeal and replace ObamaCare this year voted for a provi-sion that continued the cost-sharing payments for 2 years. Our bill does the same thing. The only difference is, we eliminate any question about whether paying them is legal. Now, why would so many Repub-licans and so many Democrats support these payments for 2 years and why would the President of the United States be interested in them? It is be-cause the Congressional Budget Office has told us that if we don’t do it—if we let them expire—premiums in 2018 will go up an average of 20 percent. They

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6605 October 19, 2017 
are already set, in most cases. The Fed-eral debt will increase by $194 billion because of the extra cost of subsidies to pay the higher premiums, and up to 16 million Americans may live in counties where they are not able to buy any in-surance in the individual market. So unless the cost-sharing payments, which the President says are illegal— and I agree with him. The Federal Court in Washington, DC, has told him they are illegal, not properly author-ized by Congress. Unless they are re-placed by something else temporarily, there will be chaos in this country, and millions of Americans will be hurt. The President says there should be no bailout of insurance companies—no bailout of insurance companies. I agree 100 percent and so does Senator M
UR-
RAY. She can speak for herself. I have said to the President in our telephone calls—as I mentioned, 4 of them in the last 10 days—that if there is a way to improve the language in our bill, we would like to do that. We have a page and a half to make it clear that the benefits go to consumers, not insur-ance companies. That can always be improved. Some conservatives object to the idea of paying them at all, but I would ask this: What is conservative about unaffordable premiums? What is con-servative about $194 billion of new Fed-eral debt? What is conservative about creating chaos so millions can’t buy in-surance or at least failing to deal with the chaos that has been created? What is conservative about a four-lane high-way that would be the chaos that leads to a single-payer solution for insurance in this country? Do we really think that if 50 counties in Tennessee or Iowa or Kansas or any State are in a situa-tion where no one can buy insurance on the individual market, that govern-ment-sponsored insurance is not far be-hind? Of course it is. That is why Sen-ator G
RAHAM and Senator C ASSIDY have cosponsored our bill, because our bill would have been part of the Senate Re-publican repeal-and-replace bills if budget rules had allowed it. Senator G
RAHAM and Senator C AS-
SIDY know that if we repeal and replace ObamaCare in 1 year or 2 years or 3 years, it takes 2 or 3 years for it to take effect. We still need the cost-shar-ing payments for the interim, and you can’t pass those in the Senate with 51 votes. It takes 60. Democrats are for it. The Republican House majority has voted for it. The sponsor of the Senate repeal-and-replace bills are cosponsors of this agreement. It sounds like some-thing that might actually become law before the end of the year. Second, flexibility. The biggest dif-ference between the Senate Repub-licans and the Senate Democrats with regard to health insurance and the in-dividual market is whether Washington should write more of the rules or States should write more of the rules. Our position has been that States should write more of the rules. We have had about 50 votes—maybe more—and we have lost them all. We have made thousands of speeches, and we have lost them all. In the last 7 years, we haven’t moved an inch toward our ob-jectives of giving States more flexi-bility in creating insurance policies in the individual market. This agreement does. It provides and authorizes States to offer an insurance policy called cata-strophic insurance for people of all ages that would keep a medical catas-trophe from turning into a financial catastrophe. It encourages interstate agreements among States in health in-surance. It streamlines the innovation waiver—section 1332, we call it—for States that want to do what Alaska did, which is to create a fund to pay for the very sick and then reduce pre-miums for everybody else by 20 percent and use no new Federal dollars. Most important, it changes the law to make it easier for States like Iowa, Okla-homa, New Hampshire, Minnesota, Massachusetts, Tennessee, Alaska, and many others to use their creativity to write policies that offer more choices and lower costs. Some have said: Well, that is not enough. Well, that is more than we have gotten for 8 years, and it is the first step. I welcome anyone who wants to nego-tiate further with Senator MURRAY or Senator S
CHUMER . That is what the legislative process is about. Now, because I forgot to do it when I listed the sponsors, I would like to add Senator I
SAKSON and Senator G RASS -
LEYto the sponsor list, which would be two additional Republican sponsors, I would say to Senator M
URRAY . That gives us a total of 12. I thank Senator G
RASSLEY for his support. The only thing I would say to those who want to negotiate further to get more flexibility is to keep in mind that with the cost-sharing payments, you can’t get most of those changes with-out 60 votes in the Senate. I thank Senator M
URRAY for being an able and effective negotiating partner. We have worked on many pieces of leg-islation together. She is tough and re-spected in her caucus. She does what she says she will do, and she is inter-ested in getting a result. I respect that and I thank her. I thank President Trump for his en-couragement. He called me 10 days ago, he called me last Saturday, and he called me again yesterday. I thank him for his encouragement—to encourage someone to come up with a bipartisan agreement to cover these 2 years so people wouldn’t be harmed—and his willingness to consider what we are of-fering today. I thank Senator M
CCONNELL and Sen-ator S
CHUMER because they have cre-ated an environment in which Senator M
URRAY and I could make this pro-posal. I hope they and our other col-leagues will seriously consider it. The President was right to suggest that we need a short-term agreement so people will not be hurt. Now, some people are still objecting to the idea of continuing these temporary cost-shar-ing payments for 2 years and the other provisions that would have as the ob-jective to keep premiums from going up in 2018 and for premiums to begin to go down in 2019. They are listening to groups around Washington, DC. I would suggest they listen to some other people. Listen to the waitress, listen to the songwriter, listen to the bricklayer, listen to the small businesswoman, and the people of America—and there are 350,000 in Tennessee—who may be terrified by the prospect of increasing premiums or even by the prospect of not being able to buy insurance at all. These are peo-ple who don’t get insurance from the government. They don’t get it on the job. They might never know when they are going to lose their job and they will be in this individual market. We have a solution here. Senator MURRAY and I—24 total Senators—are offering it today. We are certain it can be improved. We look forward to work-ing with those who would improve it, but I do not believe Congress would want to fail to deal with a problem that will hurt millions of Americans if we allow it to continue. I predict this agreement that we 24 Senators are suggesting today will be-come law in some fashion before the end of the year. I think most Senators and most House Members will be look-ing around for a solution when they consider the consequences of a failure to act. When they look for a solution, I believe this solution supported by 24 Senators—half Democrats, half Repub-licans—will be the easiest solution to adopt. I believe all the Democrats want it. Almost all of the House Republicans have already voted for it this year, and the Senate Republican leaders who would prefer to repeal and replace ObamaCare would put it in their bill if they could get it in there, but they can’t because the budget rules will not allow it.

Mr. ALEXANDER. I yield the floor to Senator M
URRAY . The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Washington. Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, first I thank Chairman A
LEXANDER for his leadership in launching a bipartisan process, as well as his dedication to seeing it through and getting a result, as he said. I have to say that, after 7 years of in-tense partisanship on these issues, which would lead everyone to believe that there was no hope for Republicans and Democrats to come together and work to strengthen our healthcare, I am really pleased with this common ground we have been able to find, pro-viding multiple years of certainty when it comes to payments to reduce out-of-pocket costs that affect the peo-ple Senator ALEXANDER just talked about—the waitress, the songwriter, and people who care and need this—re-storing critical investments, making sure people know about enrollment and can get coverage, and offering States more flexibility to innovate, as the Af-fordable Care Act intended, while maintaining those essential health benefits, like maternity care, pro-tecting people with preexisting condi-tions, and the elderly. It does all this while making sure that costs do go down for our families and preventing insurers from double-dipping and get-ting the benefit of both cost reduction and higher premiums. If there are ways to do this even more, to make sure pa-tients come first and insurers can’t pad their profits, I, as I know Senator A
LEXANDER is, as well, am open to that. Chairman A
LEXANDER just took some time to lay out the policies we are put-ting forward in this legislation. So I will not go into those details. But I do want to take a few minutes to focus on what this legislation would mean for the people we are all here to serve be-cause what is really at stake is that patients and families across the coun-try are now looking ahead to next year, and they are realizing they are about to pay the price for the uncer-tainty and partisanship we have seen, especially from this administration, on healthcare over the last 9 months. To many of those families, that out- of-pocket cost-reduction payment we are debating in Congress has nothing to do with politics and has everything to do with whether they will be able to make ends meet at the end of the month. Now the law is very clear that these payments are required, but with the President’s decision to stop them, families are looking to this Congress and the administration and asking what we plan to do. So I am very glad that Democrats and Republicans agreed that we need to act. We could do much better working together under regular order rather than doubling down on partisanship and dysfunction. As a result of the hard work of Chairman A
LEXANDER and members of our HELP Committee and with input from half of the Senate, we were able to put forward an answer—a bipartisan solution that prevents fami-lies from paying the price of sabotage and uncertainty and one that Members on both sides of the aisle can be proud to support, starting with the list of original cosponsors we are revealing today. Senator ALEXANDER listed the 12 Republicans. The 12 Democrats are Senators M
URRAY , K ING, S HAHEEN , D
ONNELLY , K LOBUCHAR , H EITKAMP , F
RANKEN , MANCHIN , CARPER , BALDWIN , M
CCASKILL and H ASSAN . We are doing this today not only be-cause it will help protect our families from premium spikes that are set to kick off in the next year but because it sends a powerful message that, when Members of Congress decide to get past our talking points and take a few steps out of our partisan corners, there is a lot we can agree on and a lot we can get done. Chairman A
LEXANDER and I are going to continue to make the case for this agreement. We are already getting a promising response from many Mem-bers on both sides of the aisle. I am very appreciative of Senator S
CHUMER  for his strong support and I am opti-mistic that, with Chairman A
LEXANDER  working on this, we will continue to build momentum and, as he said, we will get this done. At the end of the day, this isn’t about Republicans or Democrats. It is about doing the right thing for the people we serve. That means having an answer to the premium spikes that are going to set in and burden our families next year. We have been able to find one. It is bipartisan. We both gave on this. I really hope all of our colleagues will work with us to get this signed into law and show the American public that we can get the job done for them and we understand the priorities of this country. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Tennessee. Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, if I could ask a question, through the Chair, to the Senator from Wash-ington. In my conversations with President Trump, he has made it clear—and sev-eral of my colleagues have made it clear on the Republican side—that they don’t want to bail out insurance com-panies. What I responded is that I 100- percent agree. I have already said this to the Presi-dent, but I think it is important for our colleagues to know that probably the most heated debate Senator M
URRAY  and I had was not over whether we agreed with that but on how to actu-ally do it in the most effective, strong-est, toughest way possible. So I wish to emphasize the point that these payments are designed to help low-income Americans pay their copays and deductibles. We have in our agreement about a page and a half of language that requires every State to make sure the benefits of those pay-ments go to the consumers in 2018 and not to the insurance companies. I wish to ask Senator M
URRAY if she sees any disagreement at all between her and me, and most of our colleagues on that side of the aisle and over here, about whether we want to bail out in-surance companies or whether we

would be willing to consider any effec-tive language that would improve our own language. Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I would respond to my colleague, through the Chair, that negotiations are always tough. There are things you disagree on, and you have to work your way to an answer. The one issue we did not disagree on but we worked the hardest on and had the most discussion on was how we make sure we have the language in place on this—that con-sumers benefit and it is not a bailout for insurers. We absolutely share that point, and I know we both heard from Members on both sides of the aisle that they share that point. We have strong language in here, but we are still open together to make it stronger under anybody’s suggestion because our intent is to make sure our constituents get the result of this. We are together on that and working on that. I, absolutely, disregard anyone who says this is a bailout for insurers because they haven’t read the bill, if they have seen it. I thank Senator A
LEXANDER for his attention, discussions, and hard work to reach this point. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Alaska. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, be-fore I speak on an amendment that is expected to be voted on later this after-noon, I wish to take just a brief mo-ment and thank my colleagues, the Chairman of the HELP Committee and his ranking member, Senator M
URRAY . The work they have done to knit to-gether this compromise—and we all recognize it is a compromise—is such an important one, and it comes at such an important time. It is not only good from a policy per-spective to ensure that we don’t pull out the underpinnings on the indi-vidual market here, but it is good, from the perspective of the health of our institution, to be able to dem-onstrate that, at a time when things are a little tense, let’s just say, on issues that are highly emotional, high-ly personal, and highly, highly com-plex, we can come together and we can demonstrate the ability to govern. It doesn’t come without great patience and persistence, and these two individ-uals, these two leaders, have really helped guide us here in the Senate to find a better path, not only when it comes to how we deal with access to healthcare, reducing costs, reducing premiums, and providing for better lev-els of care but also a better path for the Senate. So I want to acknowledge and show my genuine appreciation for their lead-ership. Mr. President, as chairman of the En-ergy Committee, I come to the floor today to urge every Member here to vote against amendment No. 1301, which will be voted on later on this afternoon. The fiscal year 2018 budget resolution instructs the Energy Committee to raise $1 billion over the next decade. That is all that it does. It just says: Go out and find $1 billion over the next decade. I appreciate Chairman ENZI’s willing-ness to include this instruction, and I have every confidence that our com-mittee will be able to meet the instruc-tion. There are good reasons why we should be able to meet it, and, really, very good reasons why we should op-pose an amendment that would pre-emptively strike it. I think it is fair to say that we have opportunities within the energy sector to help advance this country when it comes to our energy security, our na-tional security, and our economic secu-rity. But we need to be able to move forward with that. So what we are able to do within this instruction, which is pretty wide open, is to focus on those areas where we might be able to see increased energy production that could bring us new wealth—that could create new wealth in this country. I am going to be the first to agree that some of our options within this open instruction are better than oth-ers. Some will create jobs. Some may end jobs. Some will reduce energy costs as opposed to raising them. Some will increase our energy and mineral secu-rity as opposed to sacrifice or selling it off. What I hope Members will do is look at this instruction as an opportunity to do something constructive for the country. The best example of that is to expand energy development in our Fed-eral areas where we have seen decline in recent years. I think we recognize that responsible development not only will reduce our immediate deficits, but it is about jobs and job creation. It is about wealth and wealth creation, about allowing us to build new wealth and create prosperity. It will help energy affordability for our families and businesses. That is some-thing I hear about all the time. It will strengthen our national security and our competitiveness. This is a point that needs to be em-phasized over and over again. It is not only energy security, but it is national security. When we are dependent on other nations for our energy resources, there is an energy insecurity and vul-nerability. We also realize energy pro-duction will ensure the type of growth we need to finally begin reducing the Federal debt, which is now over $20 trillion. In short, what we will be able to do with this energy instruction is allow us to create new wealth. Why wouldn’t that be something we would all em-brace? I think the instruction will allow us to see some enduring benefits that will be felt all across our country. I think it is important to recognize and to state that this does not come at the expense of our environment. This is not an either/or proposition. Anyone famil-iar with modern development can rec-ognize that as the scare tactic it is. Senator SULLIVAN , my colleague from the State of Alaska, was on the floor earlier this morning, and he spoke to the outdated, stale arguments we have heard repeated on the floor and why we must reject them. The amendment we have in front of us, 1301, simply strikes the section in the resolution that would provide for the Energy Committee instruction. The purpose perhaps takes it a little bit further in mentioning and bringing out the Arctic National Wildlife Ref-uge, ANWR. There has been a lot of dis-cussion on the floor about ANWR al-ready. Senator S
ULLIVAN , when he spoke earlier, spoke to the broader opportuni-ties we have seen in the Arctic with Arctic development in general. I want to raise a few facts about ANWR more specifically, since it clearly has been put out there for discussion. As an Alaskan, and one who has been part of these debates for many years now, not only on the Senate floor but in Alaska, we know what we are talk-ing about when we discuss the issue of Arctic development. We know and un-derstand what ANWR is, where the wil-derness area is, and what the 1002 area is. I think it is important to put it into context. ANWR is an area of 19.3 mil-lion acres. It is about the size of the State of South Carolina. Included in this ANWR area are 8 million acres of Federal wilderness. You have wilder-ness area, you have refuge area, but you have nonwilderness area des-ignated as the 1002 area. That is this area on the coastal plain. This is an area of 1.5 million acres. Delaware is about 1.3 million acres. The 1002 area is what was specifically set aside under ANILCA that would allow for consider-ation for its oil and gas potential. When ANWR was established, it was recognized that there were areas that were appropriate for wilderness, and there were areas that were appropriate to be reviewed and considered for their exploration and production potential. That is what we are talking about within the 1002 area. Even within this area that was specifically set aside, we are not asking to develop all of the 1002. We are asking to develop just 2,000 Federal acres within it, effectively one ten-thousandths of the refuge area. You can’t see it, but that little red dot is basically what we are talking about. We can say this. We can say we don’t need to do more than 2,000 acres, in this 19.3 million-acre area that has been set aside specifically for oil and gas production, because of what has happened over the decades with regard to our technologies, how we have worked to reduce the footprint since Prudhoe Bay opened over 40 years ago. Well pads on the North Slope have shrunk by over 80 percent in these in-tervening years. We are talking now about pad areas that are 12 acres in size—10, 11, 12 acres in size. We have reduced the footprint dra-matically, but what we have expanded

dramatically is the subsurface reach. The new technologies have allowed us to increase the ability to reach out under the surface to an area 125 square miles—125 miles. We have increased it by 4,000 percent, in the years we have been producing, exploring, and inno-vating up north, due to the tech-nologies we use for exploration. Sen-ator S
ULLIVAN showed the ice roads we use that reduce the impact on the sur-face and avoid the need for permanent roads. We use forward looking infrared cam-eras to survey for polar bear dens so we can avoid them. There was actually a story just this spring about a polar bear that was denning. We found where she was by using the technologies that we know and literally working around where that polar bear was until she emerged from her den with her cub in the spring. It is working with the tech-nologies we have to allow for the activ-ity but with minimal disturbance to not only the land but to the wildlife there. Caribou. We all know about the car-ibou in the North Slope area. What we have learned is that over the years, the caribou that occupy these areas have not suffered. In fact, they have thrived. When oil development first began, we were looking at herds in the numbers of about 5,000. Just this last year, the caribou herd is numbering about 22,000, and it has maintained steady and sub-stantial levels. When you understand what the 1002 area really is and what development would actually look like, it is not hard to understand why you have Alaskans’ support. Over 70 percent of Alaskans support responsible development there. I want to give you one of the best ex-amples. Matthew Rexford is the presi-dent of Kaktovik Inupiat Corporation, KIC, which is a member of the Voice of the Arctic Inupiat. This is a group of community leaders from our North Slope. He wrote a great opinion piece not too long ago, explaining why he supports responsible development in the 1002 area. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the R
ECORD Matthew Rexford’s op-ed. There being no objection, the mate-rial was ordered to be printed in the R
ECORD , as follows: 
[From the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner, Oct. 2, 2017] A
LASKANS SAYYES TO DRILLING IN ANWR (By Matthew Rexford) The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is the largest wildlife refuge in America. Spanning more than 19 million acres, it’s an area larg-er than 10 U.S. states. This vast expanse is home to caribou, fox, bears and other spe-cies. Much of that land is also home to the Native In˜upiat, and our people have used the resources it has blessed us with for more than 10,000 years. One of those natural re-sources lies beneath this great land—oil and gas, and lots of it. The debate over opening ANWR to drilling gained headway nationally in 1980, when President Jimmy Carter set aside less than 8 percent of the refuge for potential oil and gas development. This section of ANWR be-came known as the 1002 area, after a section of the Alaska National Interest Lands Con-servation Act. Since then, Alaskans and the oil and gas industry have fought unsuccessfully to open the 1002 area to drilling, which literally re-quires an act of Congress. At the same time, Lower 48 lawmakers, special interest groups across the country, folks and organizations around the world have waged war on the idea, citing the disruption of wildlife and the pristine Arctic environment. As ANWR debates occur, the views of the In˜upiat who call the area home are often-times left out. The wishes of the people who live in and around the refuge’s coastal plain frequently are drowned out by people who live hundreds—even thousands—of miles away, many of whom have never bothered to set foot anywhere near the Arctic. Well, today is a new day. Voice of the Arctic In˜upiat, an organiza-tion with 21 members from across the Arctic Slope region, including members from Kaktovik located inside ANWR, have voted unanimously to pass a resolution supporting oil and gas development in the 1002 area. This is an unprecedented show of unity by community leaders of the North Slope— those who live in and around the coastal plain of the refuge—and should send a clear message to America that we support develop-ment of a portion of the coastal plain. My fellow In˜upiat and I firmly believe in a social license to operate, and perhaps no other potential project in the history of America has called for such a blessing from local indigenous peoples more than this one. When oil was first discovered on our land in 1969, the In˜upiat were worried of industry activities and fought hard for self-deter-mination to protect our subsistence re-sources. So we fully understand the trepi-dation from outsiders: the fear that the pres-ence of industry on the coastal plain of ANWR could disrupt wildlife and affect America’s manufactured perspective of our land and culture. However, we also have the benefit of dec-ades of experience working with the oil and gas industry to implement stringent regula-tions to protect our lands, and the industry consistently has lived up to our standards. Prudhoe Bay, the largest oil field on the con-tinent, located 60 miles west of the coastal plain of ANWR, has demonstrated for four decades that resource development and eco-logical preservation can coexist in the Arc-tic. The oil and gas industry supports our com-munities by providing jobs, business oppor-tunities and infrastructure investments, has built our schools and hospitals, and has pro-vided other basic services most Americans may take for granted. Our region recognizes its importance to our local and state econ-omy, and we believe that development can be done responsibly in a portion of the 1002 area. We are not alone. During the past 35 years, the Alaska Legis-lature has consistently passed resolution after resolution supporting the opening of ANWR to drilling. During that same time, each Alaska member of Congress and every Alaska governor has supported responsible development of the 1002 area. More recently, in January, U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski introduced Senate Bill 49—the Alaska Oil and Gas Production Act—to allow development of 2,000 surface acres in the ref-uge’s coastal plain. This legislation served as the catalyst for the In˜upiat people coming together to make an informed, united deci-sion on whether or not to support drilling in ANWR. As In˜upiat, we stand to be unarguably the most affected by oil and gas activity in the Arctic. Therefore, we have the greatest stake in seeing that any and all development keeps our land and subsistence resources safe. We know it can be done, because it’s being done. Now is the time to open ANWR to drilling. Ms. MURKOWSKI. In part, Matthew states: 
As ANWR debates occur, the views of the Inupiat who call the area home are often-times left out. The wishes of the people who live in and around the refuge’s coastal plain frequently are drowned out by people who live hundreds—even thousands—of miles away, many of whom have never bothered to set foot anywhere near the Arctic. Well, today is a new day. 
He goes on to speak to the Voice of the Arctic Inupiat, which has members from across the Arctic Slope who have voted unanimously to pass a resolution supporting oil and gas development in the 1002 area. He goes on further to state: 
When oil was first discovered on our land in 1969, the Inupiat were worried of industry activities and fought hard for self-deter-mination to protect our subsistence re-sources. So we fully understand the trepi-dation from outsiders: the fear that the pres-ence of industry on the coastal plain of ANWR could disrupt wildlife and affect America’s manufactured perspective of our land and culture. However, we also have the benefit of dec-ades of experience working with the oil and gas industry to implement stringent regula-tions to protect our lands, and the industry consistently has lived up to our standards. Prudhoe Bay, the largest oil field on the con-tinent, located 60 miles west of the coastal plain of ANWR, has demonstrated for four decades that resource development and eco-logical preservation can co-exist in the Arc-tic. The oil and gas industry supports our com-munities by providing jobs, business oppor-tunities and infrastructure investments, has built our schools and hospitals, and has pro-vided other basic services most Americans may take for granted. Our region recognizes its importance to our local and state econ-omy, and we believe that development can be done responsibly in a portion of the 1002 area. We are not alone. 
I am with Matthew and a strong ma-jority of Alaskans are. These are the voices we need to be listening to. My answer on this discussion is yes. Open-ing the nonwilderness 1002 area to de-velopment is an option to meet the in-structions to the Energy Committee, but it is not the only option. I will tell you, it is the best option, and it is on the table. We should be clear, amendment No. 1301 is not a vote to open the 1002 area or to keep it closed. It is about whether this instruction should stay in the budget resolution, and it is about whether we are going to recognize the substantial benefits that await us or whether we are going to ignore our fu-ture energy needs and once again wind up in a situation where we see prices rising, families hurting, and everyone is wondering: Why didn’t you act when you had a chance? I think we all recognize that we are enjoying some benefits of lower energy prices, and some have suggested here: Hey, we are all fine. We don’t need to do anything. A few have even said that

because we are exporting oil now, we don’t need to do more for ourselves here. It is truly an open invitation to ignore the supply side. That is just a bad idea. Quite honestly, we have been down that road before, and we know enough not to be in that place again. The EIA, the Energy Information Ad-ministration, projects that in 2040, the world will be using more oil, not less. They project that our country will still be importing about 7 million barrels a day on a net basis. They project prices will be back above $100 a barrel. There are other experts who are already pointing to other signs. The Inter-national Energy Agency recently found that ‘‘global oil supply could struggle to keep pace with demand after 2020, risking a sharp increase in prices, un-less new projects are approved soon.’’ My point here is we have an oppor-tunity. We have an opportunity not only to help America create jobs, to allow for opportunities not only in my home State but around the country, we have an opportunity to ensure a level of energy security while at the same time broadening this to enhance our national security. So what I am asking my colleagues today is to not preempt this very im-portant conversation. Give us a chance to consider this instruction within our committee. We will have an oppor-tunity for hearings, and we will be able to put these options out on the table and understand more fully how we can do more when it comes to energy pro-duction in this country. Let the En-ergy and Natural Resources Committee do its part in helping. Let’s not pull the plug even before we get going. Given everything that we have heard here on the floor about strengthening our economy and protecting the middle class and making life better for people whom we serve, I think we really have to ask the very legitimate question: Why? Why would one leave energy out of this debate? Why would we limit our opportunity to create new wealth in this country? I would again urge the Senate to re-ject this amendment. It would deprive us of a substantial opportunity to ben-efit our country and ensure that we have great prospects and possibilities in front of us. The Energy and Natural Resources Committee wanted to see this instruc-tion in the budget resolution. I have every confidence that we can meet it, so I would urge Members to vote no on the motion to strike when that comes up later today. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Delaware. 
AMENDMENT NO . 1138 TO AMENDMENT NO . 1116 
Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I join my colleague from the State of Virginia, Senator W
ARNER , in offering an amend-ment that will prevent tax reform from ballooning our deficits. The Republican budget, which we are currently considering, includes a trou-bling provision that would exempt a $1.5 trillion tax reform bill from the important requirement that legislation that adds costs to the U.S. Government must be paid for rather than merely added to our deficit. This rule, well known to our colleagues, is one by which I am troubled to see a number of my longtime friends choose to ignore this time around—a rule long known in the Senate as the pay-as-you-go rule, or pay-go. It is an important rule that forces Congress to be responsible stew-ards of taxpayer dollars. It forces Con-gress to find ways to actually pay for new programs or find offsets for reduc-tions in revenue rather than to add to our national debt. It is the right pol-icy, and it has been in place for years. So it is, frankly, jarring that this budget document would include a pro-vision that explicitly exempts a $1.5 trillion tax reform bill from the pay-go rule. Look, I agree that we need to work together toward a bipartisan tax re-form bill, one that reduces taxes on the middle class and simplifies our overly complicated Tax Code, but we cannot simply pass a budget that allows Con-gress to put $1.5 trillion more on the government’s credit card, on our credit card. I thank Senator WARNER for his long leadership on the need for fiscally re-sponsible governing. Senator W
ARNER  is a former Governor and a successful business leader, and he understands the importance of sound fiscal manage-ment and the danger that our national debt poses to our long-term economic prosperity. I am proud to work with him and to remind our colleagues of the Senate’s longstanding support of pay-go. I encourage all Members, espe-cially my Republican colleagues, to support this amendment. Now, with the forbearance of my col-league, I will speak to one other amendment for a moment. There is an amendment that I have introduced that I know may well not get a vote but that I wanted to speak to. It would ensure that, as we consider tax reform, we do not forget those who are the most in need of our assistance right now and in the future. The United States was hit very hard by three hurricanes and many wildfires this year. In particular, Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory of 3.4 million people, was devastated by Hurricane Maria, which was wider than the entire island. It caused massive damage and is now re-sulting in a humanitarian crisis. Puer-to Rico’s 3.4 million people is several times more than live in my State of Delaware. It is about the size of Con-necticut. Once we get past this initial crisis and restore power, provide clean drink-ing water, get hospitals functioning, and ensure people have housing, then Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, the areas of Houston, TX, and Miami, FL, as well as areas affected by wildfires in all of these other parts of our country will have significant re-building needs. We have representatives of the Gov-ernor of Puerto Rico and the Governor himself here on the Hill this week to clarify just how much more will be needed for the Marshall Plan-style in-vestment to rebuild Puerto Rico. I am going to be advocating that we provide further support for folks from the Cor-poration for National and Community Service, AmeriCorps volunteers, and NCCC volunteers. Thousands of them have served in response to these emer-gencies. We are going to need invest-ments in CDBGs for parks and for in-frastructure. Before I hand it over to my colleague from Virginia, I want to reference a second amendment that would prevent us from moving forward with tax re-form until we first provide for the needs of Americans who have been af-fected by these disasters and emer-gencies. I wish we would take that up. Let me close by thanking my col-league from Virginia for his long lead-ership on the issue of responsible fiscal management for our country. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Virginia. Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, let me thank my friend, the Senator from Delaware, for his kind comments. More importantly, I thank him for his good work that he brings to the issue of fis-cal responsibility. Before he served here in the Senate, he served as the head of one of the largest counties in Delaware. Whether you serve as a county chairman or as a Governor, you are used to the notion that you have to pay your bills. I very much appreciate his support for this amendment, that of keeping pay-go in place. Let me also echo that I absolutely support his notion that the American citizens in Puerto Rico deserve not to be forgotten and deserve to receive the same attention we have bestowed upon Americans in Texas or in Florida or in Louisiana or elsewhere around our great country when they were victims of national disasters. I hope the Sen-ator from Delaware gets a chance to submit his amendment. While Puerto Rico is not receiving sufficient attention, there is another American territory nearby, the U.S. Virgin Islands, that also has those same kinds of challenges. If the Sen-ator gets a chance to submit that amendment, I hope he will include the U.S. Virgin Islands in there as well. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1138, which I filed at the desk.

(Purpose: To strike the Senate pay-as-you-go exemption for tax cut reconciliation legis-lation and the exception to rules pre-venting any legislation from increasing the deficit over the short-term) On page 50, line 8, strike ‘‘, and’’ and all that follows through ‘‘ledger,’’ on line 9. Beginning on page 50, strike line 23 and all that follows through page 51, line 3. 
Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of my amendment to strike language in this budget resolu-tion that would exempt the $1.5 trillion tax reconciliation instructions from Senate rules that are meant to prevent this body from dramatically increasing our debts and deficits. I know that everybody is coming back from lunch, and they probably feel pretty good and do not want to get indigestion, but remember, our country is sitting on top of a $20 trillion debt at this point, an accumulation in which both parties have unclean hands. In the years that I have been in this institution, I have worked with my Re-publican colleagues on issues that try to address debts and deficits, but there is the notion that we are about to take on a budget resolution this afternoon and start with the premise that the rules that are there to try to protect us from being fiscally irresponsible are going to be blown off at the outset. To say that we are going to start with $1.5 trillion in the hole before we start counting is beyond irresponsible. I thank my friend, the Senator from Delaware, for joining me in offering this amendment. Mr. CORNYN. Will the Senator from Virginia yield for a question? Mr. WARNER. I am pleased to yield to my friend, the Senator from Texas, for a question as long as I still get a chance to finish my comments. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I appre-ciate that. And the Senator from Vir-ginia is my friend. We work together closely on the Intelligence Committee on a number of matters. I just want to ask a pretty basic question, which is whether the Senator from Virginia believes that it is pos-sible to improve economic growth as a result of tax reform in such a way as it will close that $1.5 trillion gap that he is so concerned about. Some econo-mists—ones who I believe are people we can depend on—have suggested that as much as a four-tenths of 1 percent in-crease in our GDP will essentially im-prove our economy to the point at which that gap will close to zero, and we will actually see true deficit reduc-tion. Does the Senator agree with that or disagree? Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas for his com-ment. Let me say where I might agree with some of Senator C
ORNYN ’s principles. I believe that we need a more simplified Tax Code. I believe that a goal of our Tax Code ought to put American busi-ness on a competitive basis with those of other countries around the world. I believe, as well, that to do that, one of the goals of tax reform ought to be to lower corporate rates. I will point out, though, three quick things so that I may get back to finishing my com-ments. One, let’s actually look at where America’s tax burden stands versus those of other nations that actually have lower corporate tax rates, for ex-ample. Out of the 34 OECD nations—35 now—if you were to listen to some folks on this floor, you would think that America must rank at the top of that list, but we are 31 out of 35. The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. Mr. CORNYN. Thank you, Mr. Presi-dent. We will continue our conversa-tion. Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, since I had a few moments and I was trying to give cour-tesy to answer my colleague, for an ad-ditional 5 minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Mr. CORNYN. Just to clarify, is the request for an additional 5 minutes of debate? Mr. WARNER. Five minutes to an-swer the Senator’s question and to make my very short statement. Mr. CORNYN. I object to any addi-tional time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-tion is heard. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. All time has expired. The time was until 2 p.m. Mr. WARNER. I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient sec-ond. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk called the roll. Mr. CORNYN. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator from Mississippi (Mr. COCHRAN ). Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. M

The amendment (No. 1138) was re-jected. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Arizona. Mr. M
CCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the Sen-ate as in morning business. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. M
CCAIN. Mr. President, I came to the floor today in support of the budget resolution for one reason. It is because it provides the Senate a path forward on tax reform. I strongly sup-port this effort to fix America’s bur-densome tax system. It is my hope that reform will lead to simplifying the Tax Code, strengthening the middle class, and ultimately boosting our economy. Unfortunately, I cannot offer my sup-port without reservation, so I have come to the floor today to explain my concerns and remind my colleagues of the important work ahead of us. Even as we support this resolution as a means to achieve meaningful tax re-form, we must acknowledge the fact that the underlying budget contains an insufficient level of funding for na-tional defense. As chairman of the Sen-ate Armed Services Committee, my highest priority is to ensure that our men and women serving in uniform have the training, equipment, and re-sources they need to keep our Nation safe. The Senate budget resolution will set fiscal year 2018 defense spending at the levels dictated by the Budget Control Act cap. This budget is $54 billion less than the President’s request and $86 billion less than this body authorized just last month in the National De-fense Authorization Act. We passed the National Defense Authorization Act by a vote of 89 to 9, a demonstration of the overwhelming bipartisan belief that the Budget Control Act level of defense spending is inadequate and unaccept-able. Let be me clear. There is no BCA- level defense budget that would be suf-ficient to provide our military with what they need to fulfill current mis-sions and prepare for future threats. For those of us who have been paying attention, we heard the warnings of the steady decline of our military. Time and again our senior military and civil-ian defense leaders have sounded the alarm about the dangers of the Budget

Control Act spending caps. The Chair-man of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, our highest uniformed military officer, General Dunford, has warned that if we continue on the current path, he as-sesses that ‘‘within 5 years, we will lose our ability to project power; the basis of how we defend the homeland, and advance U.S. interests, and meet our alliance commitments.’’ Make no mistake about what that means. America’s military advantage is degrading. Without the ability to project power, the United States will no longer be a global power. That means that we put at risk not only our ability to secure our interests and pro-tect our Nation but also the unprece-dented era of security and prosperity that American global leadership has provided the world. I might add for the benefit of my col-leagues that former President George W. Bush today gave a very strong statement emphasizing this problem and the challenge we face. This is the strategic reality we are facing in the next 5 years. It should not be a sur-prise. We have seen the steady degrada-tion of the military. The strain of con-stant operational tempo, combined with inadequate and unstable funding has, over the past 16 years, worn down the greatest military in the world. Just this week, Secretary of Defense Mattis sent a letter to the Armed Serv-ices Committee expressing his concerns with regard to the National Defense Authorization Act that we are cur-rently negotiating with the House. The very first thing he said before address-ing any of the policy changes and re-forms in the bill is that his primary concern is the Budget Control Act, and we know why—because the defense spending caps are doing such immense harms to our military. Secretary Mattis wrote: 
As I have testified before your committee, no enemy has done more to harm the warfighting readiness of our military than sequestration. 
I will repeat that for the benefit of my colleagues. 
. . . no enemy has done more to harm the warfighting readiness of our military than sequestration. Current caps continue to un-necessarily defer critical maintenance, limit aviation availability, delay modernization, and strain our men and women in uniform. 
We have seen the evidence of this harm. Over the last few months there have been a rash of training accidents, collisions, and crashes. We are seeing the tragic accidents in the news far too often. Seven sailors were killed when the USS Fitzgerald collided with a contain-ership off the coast of Japan. A Marine KC–130 crash in Mississippi killed all 16 troops on board. An Osprey helicopter crashed off the coast of Australia and that resulted in the deaths of three marines. An Army helicopter crashed off the coast of Hawaii, with five soldiers pre-sumed dead. Ten sailors perished when the USS McCain collided with a tanker near Singapore. An Army Black Hawk helicopter went down during a training mission off the coast of Yemen, and one soldier died. One soldier died during helicopter training at Fort Hood. An amphibious vehicle explosion at Camp Pendleton injured 15 Americans. A demolition accident in Fort Bragg killed one soldier and injured seven others. Two Navy pilots died in a T–45 crash in Tennessee. My friends, we are now losing more of our men and women in uniform in totally avoidable training accidents than we are in combat. There is plenty of blame to go around for all of these incidents, but we cannot ignore the fact that Congress’s inability to pro-vide adequate, stable, and predictable budgeting has contributed to the trou-bling state of affairs. While increased funding is not the only answer, there is no scenario where our military can get healthy and ready to meet the chal-lenges of an increasingly unstable world without additional resources. There is broad, bipartisan agreement about that from Members of the House of Representatives, here in the Senate, and the President. Yet we are about to vote for a budget resolution that se-verely underfunds the military because the reality is that we all know that it would not impact the actual appropria-tions. To solve these problems and to fulfill our duty to the men and women in uniform we must negotiate a bipar-tisan budget agreement that will lift the caps on defense spending. Only then can we rebuild the military, re-verse the disturbing readiness crisis, and retain our ability to project power and secure our interests around the world. I remind my colleagues that the fis-cal year started 3 weeks ago and that the Defense Department is currently operating under a continuing resolu-tion. We know the harmful effects it will have on the military. That is why getting to work on a budget deal is so urgent. We must delay no longer. The budget resolution is not meant to provide that broader budget agree-ment. This budget resolution is simply a means to get us to tax reform. How-ever, this budget resolution does rep-resent something extremely troubling. The Republican Party used to be uni-fied in its support for a strong national defense. If our leaders in Congress and the White House don’t immediately get to work negotiating a deal to lift the defense caps and fund the military at a higher level than in this budget resolu-tion, I am not sure we will be able to claim that mantle any longer. I just want to sum up by saying that we have a problem in the military today, and that is, whenever there are cuts in defense spending, the first thing that goes are the easy ones—the train-ing, readiness, the spare parts, the fly-ing hours. Those are the ones that get cut first because they are the easiest. Cutting a major weapons system or program is extremely difficult. So now we have this list, as I just read off, of men and women serving in the military and we are responsible, at least partially, for their death and in-jury. Why? Because they are not able to be trained. They are not able to be equipped. They are not able to be main-tained, and 60 percent of the F–18s are not able to fly. We have sailors and air-men who are working 100-hour work-weeks. We have gigantic problems with the ability to simply operate. Meanwhile, our adversaries are step-ping up their capabilities. Obviously, every time we turn around there is an-other crisis of some kind. Look at the world 8 years ago and look at the world today. You will find an incredible dete-rioration of America’s position and in-fluence in the world. The front page of the Economist magazine this week has a picture of the dictator of China and the title is ‘‘The world’s most powerful man,’’ and it is true. So here we are with a budget resolu-tion that basically has cut our mili-tary—that is basically not funding what we need. My friends, I do not mean to get emotional, but why should we send these young men and women in uniform in harm’s way without all they need in order to fight and defend this Nation? Right now, they are not ready. Right now, their planes can’t fly. Right now, they are not able to op-erate and train. They are not ready, and that is not just MCCAIN’s word. That is our military leaders’ words and those of some of the most respected people in America and in the world. General Mattis, General McMaster, and General Kelly will all tell you the same thing. We are sending our young men and women into hazardous situations with-out their being completely equipped and capable of defending themselves. That is wrong. What greater responsi-bility do we have than to the men and women who are serving us in uniform today? Four just died in Niger. How many of the 100 Members of this body knew that we even had an operation in Niger? I will not go into the details, in deference to the family, but this is wrong, what we are doing. We saw it in the 1970s, and now we are seeing it again. It was Mark Twain who said: ‘‘History doesn’t repeat itself, but it often rhymes.’’ It is beginning to rhyme, and if we don’t, with this reso-lution that we are going through, in-crease our spending to the level as au-thorized by the National Defense Au-thorization Act, then we will bear some responsibility for what happens. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. R
OUNDS ). The Senator from Michigan. Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, later today the majority is going to attempt to pass a budget for 2018. Passing a budget has come to mean all sorts of things in Congress these days. Last year’s budget was an attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act. This budget is supposedly all about tax reform. How-ever, a budget, first and foremost,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES6614 October 19, 2017 
should be a statement about priorities for the coming year and for the coming decade. Let’s take a moment and examine what this budget says about the major-ity’s priorities. With any budget, I think you need to look at the end re-sult and ask a couple of very simple questions. First, does this budget help reduce Federal deficits and debt with a respon-sible, sensible approach? Second, does this budget, ultimately, put us on a sustainable fiscal path? The answer to these questions is a clear no. Instead, this budget is pri-marily intended to allow the majority to use an expedited procedure to move tax breaks that would increase the def-icit by $1.5 trillion over the next dec-ade. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle will say that this lost revenue is offset by spending cuts and promises of new revenues from economic growth far beyond what almost every single mainstream economist predicts. Let’s look at the trillions in cuts that the majority is proposing. Where the budget is specific, it is bad. Med-icaid is cut by $1 trillion. Medicare, which provides essential healthcare services to our seniors, is cut by $470 billion. On top of that, the budget in-cludes over $3 trillion in unspecified cuts. You don’t have to be an expert in the Federal budget to know that $3 trillion in unspecified cuts means one of two things. They are either, No. 1, cuts to programs that families and commu-nities rely on, like Head Start, Pell grants, and transportation funding, or, No. 2, they are unspecified because they are simply never going to happen. That is what we are voting on today. There is nearly $1.5 trillion in cuts to Medicare and Medicaid, and then there are trillions in cuts that are either so unpopular that no one dares name what they are or trillions more in defi-cits because there is not a plan. The Federal budget is about choices. You can learn a lot about which choices a budget puts in black and white and which are left deliberately unspecified. When it comes to the ma-jority’s tax plan, we know only a few details, but we know enough to see where there will be winners and where there will be losers. The winners will be the wealthiest Americans in our country and global corporations. We also need to look at what it means for Michigan families and small businesses, but there is a deliberate lack of detail that makes figuring out what the bottom line is for working families impossible. We don’t know where the tax brackets will start and where they will stop. We don’t know what personal exemptions families will be able to take. We don’t know the size and the scope of the child tax credit. We don’t know if important incentives for charitable contributions will be kept. The majority is even keeping open the possibility of raising taxes on Americans who are trying to save for their retirement. This budget should be straight-forward. We should reduce the tax bur-den on middle class families. We should make it simpler for Americans to file and understand their taxes. We should make it easier for them to save for re-tirement. We should increase take- home pay for Americans that work hard each and every day to make a liv-ing. Unfortunately, none of these details that are important for middle-class folks were important enough to include in this budget. That is why I will vote against it. I urge my colleagues to do the same. We cannot add another $1.5 trillion to the deficit. We cannot slash Medicare and Medicaid. This is simply the wrong direction for our country. So why are we moving forward with this budget at all? Well, on this issue, I think the administration has been clear. Passing this budget is all about passing a so-called tax reform bill. However, passing this budget is not a requirement for passing tax reform. Passing this budget is only a require-ment to pass a tax bill with as few votes as possible—without input or buy-in from Members of the minority. This is not the way we should pass real tax reform. If tax reform is going to be successful, it must have broad bipar-tisan input. I stand ready to work with my colleagues on real tax reform. Modernizing and streamlining our Tax Code can boost Michigan busi-nesses, raise take-home pay for work-ers across sectors, and help create the type of 21st century economy we need. We can make it easier for small busi-nesses, including manufacturers and family farms, to invest in themselves, and we can make the code fair across sectors. We can establish incentives for smart investment in our communities. We can implement strong, enforceable rules to prevent companies from gam-ing our tax system and moving profits and jobs overseas. For families, we can meaningfully boost take-home pay. We can expand the child tax credit and earned-income tax credit, and we can work together to find real ways to help alleviate the cost of child care. We can lessen the burden of student debt, and we can help people save for retirement. Tax reform can help create more good jobs right here at home, fix some of the issues in the code that drive jobs and companies overseas, and put more money in the pockets of working fami-lies. In 1986, Congress passed the most dra-matic reform of the Federal Tax Code in modern history. How many votes did this sweeping overhaul of the tax sys-tem get? When tax reform ultimately passed the Senate in 1986, it received 97 votes. If we want to repeat that accomplish-ment and truly overhaul our code to make it work better for American fam-ilies and American businesses, that level of bipartisanship should be our goal, not 50 or 51. I know we can do these things in a truly bipartisan manner if we are just given the chance. Let’s work together to pass real tax reform with broad sup-port from both sides of the aisle. The American people deserve nothing less. I stand ready to work with the ma-jority, and so do my colleagues. I urge the majority to abandon this effort and start over. Make the decision not to add trillions more to the deficit. Make the decision not to cut Medicare and Medicaid for Americans in need. Start over. Let’s find a path forward to find real, lasting, bipartisan solutions. I yield the floor. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, budget resolutions set general spending prior-ities for the Federal Government. The budget resolution before us today, how-ever, sets a path for so-called tax re-form that will benefit the wealthiest among us on the backs of hard-working Americans. For all their talk of reining in spending and reducing the debt, the majority is promoting a budget that will explode the debt by $1.5 trillion. They propose increasing the debt not to invest in our infrastructure or in educating the next generation. They propose increasing the debt not to ex-pand access to healthcare or promote medical research. No—they propose ex-ploding the debt to give corporations and the top one percent a tax cut. Once again, they majority is turning away from the bipartisan traditions of this Senate and toward the hyperpartisan tactics that do not result in progress for the American people. This budget invests in millionaires and billionaires like the Trump family, the Koch brothers, wealthy corpora-tions, and the top 1 percent. It turns its back on millions of hard-working American families. While the resolu-tion authorizes a $1.5 trillion increase in the debt, independent experts cal-culate that the real cost of the Trump tax plan will far exceed that amount. How will the majority pay for the dif-ference? It will slash Medicaid, a pro-posal already rejected by the Senate this year. It will slash Medicare. It will slash programs for veterans and infra-structure. It will be middle-class Americans who bear the brunt of these cuts. Ac-cording to independent analysts, mid-dle-class Americans will see their home values drop and will experience a tax increase as a result of the Trump tax plan. This shameful budget sends the message that the Senate supports put-ting tax cuts for the wealthy and big-gest corporations on our Nation’s cred-it card and, to the extent we pay for any of it, that we do so on the backs of the middle class and seniors and at the expense of protecting the environment. This budget proposes invading the Arc-tic National Wildlife Refuge. These are not Vermont values. These are not American values. This is not how our Nation became the greatest country on Earth.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6615 October 19, 2017 
After years of claiming that the def-icit is one of the greatest threats to our country, the majority today will waive away any concern about the long-term impact of increasing it. They argue that the economic growth spurred by these tax cuts will outpace the foregone revenue, but as we saw with the Bush tax cuts, this claim is simply not based in reality. This argu-ment is based on a pyramid scheme of assumptions on top of assumptions, and while we should be taking a close look at the Congressional Budget Of-fice’s projections—a range of both dy-namic and conventional scores—this budget resolution eliminates the only existing mechanism that requires the Senate to have a CBO estimate in ad-vance of a vote. Why might the major-ity want to rush a vote before exam-ining the long-term economic impacts of these proposed tax cuts? Our Tax Code is complex—very much, overly complex—and I share the view that it is in need of improvement and simplification. We can and should have a meaningful debate about tax reform, but any reforms must be certain to benefit middle-class Americans, not just the top 1 percent. We need to strengthen tax credits that promote community development and the con-struction of affordable housing. We should extend and make permanent tax credits that help those who are strug-gling to make ends meet. I am in favor of bipartisan tax reform that brings both parties together and results in balanced changes to the current sys-tem. That is in the best tradition of the Senate, and it is the path to enact-ing truly meaningful reforms that will benefit every single American. The Senate should reject this par-tisan effort, just as it rejected last month the unsuccessful partisan ef-forts to roll back health coverage for millions of Americans. We should—and can—work together to craft a balanced and sustainable budget and tax reform package. No package will be perfect, but it should be bipartisan. It should be fair. The budget before us today fails to meet that test, which is why I will op-pose it. Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, last week, people across this country cele-brated National Wildlife Refuge Week—and rightfully so. National Wildlife Refuges are one of the crown jewels of our Federal public lands net-work. These refuges provide essential habitat for some of our most imperiled species, including many impacted by climate change. Millions of refuge visi-tors also fuel local and regional econo-mies by generating billions of dollars in sales. This week, the Senate is considering a budget resolution that would open one of our refuges, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, to oil and gas drilling. Despite tremendous public support for our refuge system and the economic benefits that the refuges bring to our local economies, efforts to develop these special wild areas are ongoing and have been championed by the cur-rent administration. The budget reso-lution is another such effort to pro-mote development in a refuge, an effort that should be rejected. In some cases, refuges are compatible with develop-ment and increased human activity. In others, development decisions, such as the siting of oil and gas drilling, could negatively impact the future of both human and animal inhabitants. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, one of the largest remaining intact ecosystems in the world, is an example of the latter. The Refuge has been home to the Gwich’in people for more than 20,000 years. These Native people subsist primarily on caribou. Research shows that oil and gas development in the Refuge, even with a small foot-print, could significantly alter Porcu-pine Caribou migration patterns and calving behavior. These changes would threaten the Gwich’in people’s way of life. The U.S. 30-year-old treaty with Canada to conserve the Porcupine Car-ibou Herd could also be at risk. According to the U.S. Fish and Wild-life Service, the Arctic Refuge is the only national conservation area where polar bears regularly den. It is the most consistently used polar bear land denning area in Alaska. These iconic bears are increasingly vulnerable due to climate change, so the undisturbed Refuge land denning area is especially critical for their survival. The Refuge also hosts nearly 200 species of migra-tory birds, musk oxen, and wolves. As the Senate contemplates the fu-ture of this spectacular natural area, I want to remind my colleagues that this body has said no to opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge dozens of times. With oil prices significantly lower than they were earlier this dec-ade and oil supplies at historic highs, it is hard to understand why we would change course now. The risks far out-weigh any benefits, and the American public has consistently opposed drilling in the Arctic Refuge. I also want to express my strong con-cerns with possible pending adminis-trative action in the Santa Ana Na-tional Wildlife Refuge, another na-tional treasure. This Refuge is located on the U.S.-Mexico border, along the southernmost stretch of the Rio Grande River at the confluence of the Central and Mississippi flyways. It is home to more than 400 bird species, more than 300 species of butterflies, and more than 450 varieties of plants. The Santa Ana Refuge supports rare wildlife species, some found only deep in south Texas. The Refuge also pro-vides habitat for at least eight species protected under the Endangered Spe-cies Act, including the ocelot. There are less than 50 ocelots left in the United States, so this Refuge is essen-tial to the species’ recovery. The Santa Ana Refuge is also a pop-ular destination for birders and hosts more than 165,000 visitors each year. The booming ecotourism industry in the area is critical for local economies, which is another key reason why we need to ensure this Refuge and its in-habitants can thrive. U.S Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers planning actions earlier this year sug-gest that the Trump administration may shift existing Federal Homeland Security funds to construct a segment of-border wall through the Santa Ana Refuge. As I have said before, we already have 650 miles of fencing along our southern border with Mexico in the areas where it is most effective. I am not unequivocally opposed to physical barriers where they are needed and where they can be shown to be the most effective method of border secu-rity, but the Santa Ana Refuge is not a known problem area for border cross-ing. Furthermore, a wall through the Refuge would permanently damage critical habitat, block wildlife migra-tion routes, and would likely trap wild-life during floods. Again, a wall through the refuge would not yield intended outcomes and would harm both wildlife and commu-nities. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to question and op-pose construction of this wall segment. From Alaska to Texas to Delaware, our National Wildlife Refuge System is well worth protecting and preserving for future generations. I look forward to continued work with my colleagues and constituents to this end. Thank you. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Wyoming.

Mr. ENZI. For the information of all Senators, these are the first seven amendments we will consider during vote-arama, and we will work to get an agreement on a final list of amend-ments during these votes. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Georgia. Mr. PERDUE. Mr. President, I think I am the only one standing between this body and a vote on something that 2 years ago I didn’t know existed, and that is a ‘‘vote-arama’’ in local Senate terms. Being an outsider to the polit-ical process, I find a lot of this very strange. I came to Washington, and now I have a new vocabulary. It includes things like ‘‘scoring,’’ which doesn’t have anything to do with sports, ‘‘vote- arama,’’ which doesn’t have anything to do with the carnival down the road, or ‘‘deficit-neutral reserve fund.’’ I am still trying to figure out what that is; I see the Presiding Officer is smiling up there. Then there are ‘‘points of order.’’ There is a vocabulary centered around what we are going to be doing this afternoon, but I want to speak to the budget process itself. First of all, I want to be very clear with my colleagues on both sides. I support this budget that we are going to vote on today for one very strong reason. It is a vehicle to get to tax re-form in the United States. I will not speak on taxes today in the few min-utes that I have, but I do want to speak about the process. What we are doing in America right now in the Senate and the Congress— and what we have been doing over the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6617 October 19, 2017 
last 43 years—is losing the right to do the right thing. Let me say that again. We are losing the right to do the right thing. Just a few weeks ago, we voted with-out batting an eye for $15 billion of al-located funds for the victims of two hurricanes in Florida, Texas, and other southern States, with every dime of that money in borrowed money. We have to go to China and other places and borrow that money so we can spend and do the right thing. That is not an embellishment or an exaggeration. What about research for the rising, spiraling cost of our healthcare, driven by Alzheimer’s, cancer, and diabetes? We spend about the same amount of money on that as we spend on all for-eign aid. Yet, if we were to do more, we could cure those heinous diseases and lower our medical costs. We can invest in our infrastructure. We can abso-lutely take care of victims of wildfires, and now we have Puerto Rico. Tonight we are going to be asked to vote up or down on a supplemental bill for some $30 billion-plus for the needs of these catastrophes. We have lost the right to do the right thing, which is, of course, to meet those needs. Here is the biggest one. You just heard my great colleague, Senator M
CCAINfrom Arizona. He is the chair-man of the Armed Services Committee, of which I am a member. He talked about how decimated our military is from a funding standpoint. He talked about readiness. He talked about cap-italization. But today, we are bor-rowing every dime we spend on our military, on our veterans, and on every domestic discretionary program in the United States. That is a fact. Where do we get the money when we run out of our own money? We spend every dime of our own. By the way, we collected over $3.5 trillion of Federal tax revenue last year. It is the largest amount America has ever collected in income taxes and total taxes for the Federal Government—the most we have ever collected—but all of that money goes to mandatory expenses. As a matter of fact, since 2000, under one Republican President and one Democratic President, our government has grown from $2.4 trillion to $4 tril-lion. That is not the worst of it. The worst is yet to come. We have added in two Presidencies $14 trillion to our Federal debt. Of our $20 trillion, $14 trillion of it was added under these two Presidents. In the next 10 years, the current budget under which we are working will add another $11 trillion to our debt. Here is the problem. The blue line here is what you heard Senator M
CCAIN talk about earlier. That is our discre-tionary spending. It is flat. As a matter of fact, between 2009 and today, we have lowered discretionary spending by over one-third, by $400 billion. But what has happened is that our manda-tory expenses have exploded. On this chart, this line here, are our mandatory expenses; that is, Social Se-curity, Medicare, pension and benefits for Federal employees, and the interest on our debt. This is a formula for fi-nancial disaster. At this point, we already have $20 trillion of debt. Over the next 30 years, some estimates say that we will have over $130 trillion of future commit-ments, liabilities coming at us like a freight train. We are hamstrung because we have a budget process that doesn’t work. One thing that contributes to this is a proc-ess that over the last 43 years, since the 1974 Budget Act was put in place, which created this budget process, the budget has worked only four times in 43 years. It has funded the Federal Gov-ernment only four times. That is not a partisan comment; that is an indict-ment on this body and on the body across the hall. In any other environment—sports, medicine, business, military—imagine if you had a process that worked only four times. Imagine if you had a tank in World War II, and you are over there, and every 43 times you fired it, it worked only four times. Imagine what result would be. What we have here is a system that doesn’t work. I am going to try to ex-plain that very quickly. First, we have committees in the U.S. Senate that involve themselves in appropriations and the funding of the Federal Government. Some are called authorizing committees. These are committees like the Foreign Relations Committee; we have Appropriations. We have all of these authorizing com-mittees over here on the left. On the right here are Appropriations Commit-tees. Today, these committees have to pass 12 bills in order to fund the Fed-eral Government. Over the last 43 years, out of the 12 bills we have to appropriate to fund the government, we have averaged only 21⁄2 bills. In any other world, that can’t work. It doesn’t work here. So we end up with 179 continuing resolutions to get us past the end of our fiscal year to continue spending at last year’s rate, and then we go to an ‘‘omnibus’’—an-other new term that I had never heard of—at the end of the calendar year. Ba-sically, most times, six or eight people will get in a room and decide how to spend $1 trillion. This current budget deals with, primarily, issues that are not on the mandatory side. There is a way forward. There are Members on the other side—and I am going to call out one—my good friend from the State of Rhode Island. Sen-ator W
HITEHOUSE and I and others have been working on this for quite some time. He has a great idea: Let’s pick a point in the future, make the debt a percentage of our GDP, and work back-ward from there with guardrails on what we can do every year. There is a budget process we have been working on that creates a politi-cally neutral platform that allows both sides, in a bipartisan way, to argue and fight over what we think the budget should include, because we believe the budget should be a law. Today, the budget is only a resolu-tion, which means it is nothing but a political statement by the majority party. We then go to an authorizing process where the minority party, because they weren’t asked to play in the budget process—we have an authorizing proc-ess in which, today, we have over $300 billion of Federal expenditures a year that are not authorized, over $300 bil-lion. Then we are supposed to go to an ap-propriations process. As I have just said, we have appropriated, on average, over those 43 years, only 21⁄2bills a year instead of 12. We can fix this. It is not a partisan issue. We will absolutely fix this budg-et process in a bipartisan way. I am going to vote for this. I hope my col-leagues will vote for this budget bill so we can go on and debate taxes. The debt crisis is the No. 1 crisis we face in our country. It keeps us from doing the right thing—funding our na-tional defense and taking care of our needs. I will support this budget today, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. 
HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES  
LIEUTENANT PATRICK L . RUTH  
Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, this is not about the budget, but it is about something that all of us can, unfortu-nately, understand the importance of. On Sunday, October 1, U.S. naval aviation instructor, LT Patrick L. Ruth, and student naval aviator, LTJG Wallace Burch, were both killed when their Goshawk training jet crashed in Tellico Plains, TN. Lieutenant Ruth was a native of Louisiana, growing up in Metairie. Lieutenant Ruth served in the Navy for 9 years, beginning his ca-reer in the Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps at Tulane University. He was commissioned in May of 2008. After flight training, he joined Carrier Airborne Early Warning Squadron 126, based in Norfolk, VA, in 2012. Lieutenant Ruth flew the E–2C Hawkeye as part of the tactical air forces of the U.S. Navy. His primary mission was early warning defense of the carrier battle group, as well as air strike control, ocean surveillance, and search and rescue coordination. In April 2015, he moved to Naval Training Squadron 7, based in Merid-ian, MS. As an instructor, Lieutenant Ruth trained the next generation of naval aviators in strike aviation, basic air-craft maneuvering, and landing skills.

Lieutenant Ruth was a dedicated naval aviator. As evidence, he earned two Navy and Marine Corps Achieve-ment Medals during his distinguished career. Our brave men and women in uniform take extreme risks every day to defend our Nation. The risks are necessary, made to ensure that our military is fully prepared to face any threat. We are forever grateful for Lieutenant Ruth and those who answer the call of duty to keep us safe. We must also think of the incredible sacrifices of Lieutenant Ruth’s family and all military families. They may not be wearing uniforms, but they, too, serve our country. I had the privilege of speaking with Lieutenant Ruth’s family. I learned that his younger brother Shane is Ac-tive Duty Navy. His older brother is re-tired Navy. His sisters were, and are, so supportive. Lieutenant Ruth’s parents, David and Mary Ann Ruth, still grieve. How could any parent not? But to borrow from President Lin-coln’s letter to a grieving mother: 
I pray that our Heavenly Father may as-suage the anguish of your bereavement, and leave you only the cherished memory of the loved and lost, and the solemn pride that must be yours to have laid so costly a sac-rifice upon the alter of freedom. 
Lieutenant Ruth is survived by his parents, David and Mary; his fiance, Jessica; and his four siblings. We grieve with you. You are in our prayers. Lieutenant Patrick Ruth will not be forgotten. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, all time on the res-olution is yielded back. 
AMENDMENT NO . 1178 
There will now be 2 minutes of de-bate, equally divided, prior to a vote in relation to Flake amendment No. 1178. The Senator from Arizona. Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, this amendment would set up a deficit-neu-tral reserve fund relating to making the American tax system simpler and fairer for all Americans. Not only do we need to do tax reform, but we need to do it urgently. It has been more than 30 years since we have reformed the Tax Code in any signifi-cant way. We have more preferences and loopholes and deductions out there than we know what to do with. In fact, if we total all of them together, there are more expenditures in the Tax Code, or money avoiding coming to Wash-ington—tax avoidance—than we spend on our entire discretionary budget. It is about $1.26 trillion annually. So we have to have a code where we lower the rates and broaden the base. Broadening the base means going after some of these popular loopholes and de-ductions and preferences that make the Tax Code a lot bigger and scarier and more complicated than it should be. With that, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. C
AS-
SIDY). Who yields time in opposition? Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, we yield back the time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 1178. Mr. FLAKE.

AMENDMENT NO . 1139 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 2 minutes of debate, equal-ly divided, prior to a vote in relation to Baldwin amendment No. 1139. The Senator from Wisconsin. Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak to Baldwin amendment No. 1139. Wisconsin families need a tax break, and that is what I am working for. This budget will fast-track enor-mous tax breaks for the wealthiest few. It increases the deficit and puts Medi-care and Medicaid on the chopping block to pay for it. I don’t think it is right to ask the middle class to pay for tax breaks for the top 1 percent with cuts to Medicare and Medicaid and rising deficits—defi-cits that will surely be used by my Re-publican colleagues to continue to jus-tify an unwillingness to invest in the essential pillars of economic security for families. The entire reason reconciliation was created was for deficit reduction, which the majority claims to care so much about. My amendment is very simple. It would reinstate a point of order, known as the Conrad rule, against rec-onciliation legislation that increases the deficit. Let’s not use reconciliation to add to our deficit. I urge my colleagues to support my commonsense amendment that has been cosponsored by Senators WARNER , W
HITEHOUSE , K AINE, C OONS , K ING, W
YDEN , and V ANHOLLEN . The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Wyoming. Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, which would create an uneven playing field for the upcoming congressional reconciliation. If adopted, this amend-ment would reinstate a point of order from the fiscal year 2008 budget resolu-tion, which Congress repealed 2 years ago. It was repealed to ensure equal treatment of all reconciliation bills by restoring the level playing field that had existed prior to the adoption of the point of order in 2008. That was used under the Byrd rule. The Byrd rule specifically does not require such budget neutrality inside the budget window. Why? Because rec-onciliation was designed to be neutral in its orientation. The Budget Act states that reconciliation instructions must enumerate changes in spending and revenue amounts. It does not stip-ulate those changes must be increases or decreases. The fiscal year 2016 budget resolution restored the longstanding neutrality principle of the Byrd rule. It was the right thing to do then, and we should reaffirm that position today. I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator’s time has expired. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. Mr. ENZI. I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient sec-ond.

The amendment (No. 1139) was re-jected. 
AMENDMENT NO . 1205 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 2 minutes of debate, equal-ly divided, prior to a vote in relation to Rubio amendment No. 1205. The Senator from Florida. Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, this amendment relates to the child tax credit. It is abundantly clear that per-haps one of the most effective ways to deliver tax relief—tax cuts—to working families is through the expansion of this credit, as it is our hope to achieve during tax reform. I think it is important to point out that the U.S. Department of Agri-culture compiles data on how much it costs to raise children in the 21st cen-tury. Today, it is expected that middle- income families are going to spend $230,000 to raise their children. By the way, that does not include the cost of their going to college. Being able to deliver relief to hard- working families through the expan-sion of the child tax credit, which is applicable not just against income tax but payroll tax, is perhaps the single most effective way to do that given the framework under which we will be working. That is what this amendment intends to reserve the opportunity to do. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Maine. Mr. KING. Mr. President, I rise not in opposition to the amendment but to compliment the Senator for bringing this issue forward. I intend to support the amendment, but I just want to make the point that this is a broader issue in that we are going to have to address the child and dependent tax credit. One of issues is making it refundable so the tax credit is available and useful to lower income families, who are the hardest hit by high child care costs, and also making it available to those families who use these funds to care for perhaps an aged relative or an injured relative. I agree with the amendment, and I support it, but I think we need to make the point that there is more work to be done. I have introduced a bill with Sen-ator HELLER , Senator B URR, and Sen-ator C
OLLINS on this subject, and I look forward to bringing that forward for consideration at an appropriate mo-ment. I urge support for Senator R
UBIO’s amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Utah. Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unani-mous consent to extend debate by 30 seconds. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I rise in sup-port of this amendment. This would correct a great defect in our Tax Code—the parent tax penalty. We have been punishing parents for decades because of the way our Federal tax system and our senior entitlement programs—Social Security and Medi-care—interact. We have to end this tyr-anny and end this now. This amend-ment does that, and I urge my col-leagues to support it. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there any further debate on the amendment? If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment. The amendment (No. 1205) was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 1228 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 2 minutes of debate, equal-ly divided, prior to a vote in relation to Heitkamp amendment No. 1228. The Senator from North Dakota. Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, as we move forward on tax reform, I think the one great potential for absolute agreement is that we should lower the burden for middle-income taxpayers, and as we move forward, the one thing we absolutely should not do is in any way increase the tax burden for mid-dle-income taxpayers. This amendment is about guaranteeing that no one who makes under $250,000 sees his taxes in-crease in any kind of legislation, in-cluding in any tax reform proposal. I have heard from teachers, nurses, and veterans. They all want to know what this means for them. To guar-antee people an absolute bright line that their taxes will not go up is abso-lutely essential as we move forward. I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on this amend-ment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Wyoming. Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, again, this is another attempt to do the Finance Committee’s work as part of the budg-et. I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. The amendment would in-appropriately bind the Finance Com-mittee’s work on any tax legislation it writes. This point of order is meant to be a poison pill in the process and would set a 60-vote threshold on tax reform, ef-fectively killing its efforts through reconciliation. This resolution’s in-structions to Finance do not specify the policy or the provisions that are going to be reported out of the com-mittee, but the framework, as stated, will be just as progressive as the cur-rent Tax Code. The chairman of the Fi-nance Committee and members can as-sure you of that result. This amendment is unnecessary, and I urge my colleagues to oppose it. I raise a point of order against this amendment under the Budget Act, sec-tion 305(b)(2). The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from North Dakota. Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, pur-suant to section 904 of the Congres-sional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive section 305(b)(2) of that act for purposes of the pending amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient sec-ond. The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. CORNYN. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator from Mississippi (Mr. COCHRAN ). Mr. DURBIN.

AMENDMENT NO . 1234, AS MODIFIED  
Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unani-mous consent that the Donnelly amendment be modified with the text of his amendment No. 1423, which is at the desk. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendment (No. 1234), as modi-fied, is as follows: 
(Purpose: To establish a deficit-neutral re-serve fund relating to eliminating tax breaks for companies that ship jobs to for-eign countries) At the end of title III, add the following: 
SEC. 3lll. DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND RELATING TO ELIMINATING TAX BREAKS FOR COMPANIES THAT SHIP JOBS TO FOREIGN COUNTRIES. 
The Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate may revise the alloca-tions of a committee or committees, aggre-gates, and other appropriate levels in this resolution, and make adjustments to the pay-as-you-go ledger, for one or more bills, joint resolutions, amendments, amendments between the Houses, motions, or conference reports relating to eliminating tax breaks for companies that outsource jobs to foreign countries, by the amounts provided in such legislation for those purposes, provided that such legislation would not increase the def-icit over either the period of the total of fis-cal years 2018 through 2022 or the period of the total of fiscal years 2018 through 2027. 
Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I further ask that the pending Kaine amendment be temporarily laid aside and that the Brown amendment No. 1378 be made pending and be the next vote in the se-ries, with 2 minutes of debate prior to the vote. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. 
AMENDMENT NO . 1422 
There will now be 2 minutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in rela-tion to Portman amendment No. 1422. The Senator from Ohio. Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak on amendment No. 1422, which is a commonsense and, up to now, bi-partisan approach to international tax reform. It simply says that under this budget we would do international tax reform. It would create incentives to have more jobs here in this country. Those are incentives for both U.S. com-panies and foreign companies to create jobs here in America. This is not a partisan issue; it has been bipartisan. In fact, it was part of the Simpson-Bowles provisions with re-gard to tax reform. Only a couple of years ago, I cochaired a working group on this issue with the now minority leader, Senator S
CHUMER , where we came up with a proposal which said that the international system is bro-ken and that we need to move to one like the one we are talking about in this amendment that brings back jobs. One of the problems is that the cur-rent Tax Code actually encourages companies to keep their money off-shore. We think we could bring back a lot of that money. There is probably $2.5 to $3 trillion locked out offshore. But it is worse than that. It also leads to American companies being taken over by foreign companies and these in-versions we have heard so much about. In the last 24 hours, we had another major inversion. Companies that have household names are picking up and leaving our country and taking their jobs and investment with them. This amendment is common sense, Mr. President. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support it. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Indiana. Mr. DONNELLY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Portman amendment. We can all agree that tax reform should help create more good jobs and protect the good jobs we already have. I support the Portman amendment, and I look forward to colleagues supporting my amendment that ensures that com-panies that ship American jobs to for-eign countries are not eligible for tax breaks. I want to work with my col-leagues to make sure any tax reform package is good for American workers. Thank you, Mr. President. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? If no one yields time, the question is on agreeing to the amendment. The amendment (No. 1422) was agreed to. AMENDMENT NO . 1234, AS MODIFIED  
The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 2 minutes of debate, equal-ly divided, prior to a vote in relation to Donnelly amendment No. 1234, as modi-fied. The Senator from Indiana. Mr. DONNELLY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the amendment I offered to address the outsourcing of American jobs. Currently, American companies that ship jobs to foreign countries can still claim massive tax breaks. That is wrong, and we should claw back incentives and prohibit com-panies from receiving tax breaks for outsourcing jobs. My end outsourcing amendment is common sense for taxpayers, sup-porting companies that invest in Amer-ican workers, not those shipping jobs to foreign countries. I urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment. Mr. President, I yield back. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? If no one yields time, the question is on agreeing to the amendment, as modified. The amendment (No. 1234), as modi-fied, was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 1378 TO AMENDMENT NO . 1116

Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment be dispensed with. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To establish a deficit-neutral re-serve fund relating to providing tax bene-fits to patriot employers that invest in American jobs and provide fair pay and benefits to workers) At the end of title III, add the following: 
SEC. 3lll. DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND RELATING TO PROVIDING TAX BENE-FITS TO PATRIOT EMPLOYERS THAT INVEST IN AMERICAN JOBS AND PROVIDE FAIR PAY AND BENEFITS TO WORKERS. 
The Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate may revise the alloca-tions of a committee or committees, aggre-gates, and other appropriate levels in this resolution, and make adjustments to the pay-as-you-go ledger, for one or more bills, joint resolutions, amendments, amendments between the Houses, motions, or conference reports relating to income taxes paid by businesses, which may include measures pro-viding tax breaks for companies that have not moved overseas to avoid paying their fair share of taxes, have maintained or ex-panded their United States workforce, or have provided fair wages and quality health insurance, prepared workers for retirement, hired veterans and workers with disabilities, and provided paid family medical leave, by the amounts provided in such legislation for those purposes, provided that such legisla-tion would not increase the deficit over ei-ther the period of the total of fiscal years 2018 through 2022 or the period of the total of fiscal years 2018 through 2027. 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask for support of the Patriot Corporation Act amendment. It is all pretty simple. Over the years, we have seen compa-nies shut down production in Mans-field, OH, or Dayton, OH, and move to Tijuana, Mexico, or Hunan, China, and then sell their production back in the United States. Under this simple idea, the Patriot Corporation Act, companies that do the right thing—companies that pay their workers decent wages; companies that do the right thing by their work-ers in terms of benefits, healthcare, and pensions; companies that make their products and keep their produc-tion in the United States—will get a tax break. They will pay a lower tax rate. Yesterday at the White House, about 15 Senators met with President Trump. I talked to him about the Patriot Cor-poration Act. He said he likes the idea. It is about time that U.S. companies that do the right thing should be re-warded instead of those companies that shut down production and move over-seas and sell their products back. It is the right thing to do. It is a simple idea. Its time has come, Mr. President. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Wyoming.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6621 October 19, 2017 
Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. The budget resolution’s reconciliation instruction to the Finance Committee does not and should not specify the policies or provisions that are being re-ported out of the Budget Committee resolution. The Finance framework in-cludes international tax reform that will incentivize companies to invest domestically and create jobs in the United States. But this amendment de-fines ‘‘patriot employers’’ with a long list of criteria and pinpoints tax breaks for these companies. ‘‘Patriot employ-ers’’ should not be defined by the budg-et process or by politics but by those that allow our constituents to join and remain in the workforce so as to par-ticipate in the American dream. American companies will be able to create additional jobs based on tax re-lief envisioned by the Finance Com-mittee. As such, we should pass the resolution and reconciliation in a time-ly manner, and we should oppose this amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amend-ment. Mr. BROWN. I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient sec-ond. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk called the roll.

AMENDMENT NO . 1296 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 2 minutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to Paul amendment No. 1296. The Senator from Kentucky. Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, this amendment is about whether or not we are serious about the debt. In the cur-rent budget, there are instructions to reduce the debt by $96 billion in man-datory spending. I applaud that, but we need budget reconciliation instructions to allow it to happen. This amendment will allow instructions so we can really do what we say we are going to do, which is to cut spending. I think, in light of the fact that we are for tax cuts, we ought to also be for reducing spending so we don’t explode the debt. I recommend a ‘‘yes’’ vote on rec-onciliation instructions to allow for mandatory savings and spending. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Vermont. Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the Paul amendment. This amendment includes reconciliation instructions to cut near-ly $100 billion in programs that are vital to working families in this coun-try, including education, healthcare, nutrition, affordable housing, and many, many other programs. This amendment paves the way to make it easier to cut Medicare by over

AMENDMENT NO . 1375 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 2 minutes of debate, equal-ly divided, prior to a vote in relation to Cardin amendment No. 1375. The Senator from Maryland. Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, this amendment is very simple. It allows a point of order to be raised if the tax re-form reported back to the floor by the committee increases the deficit. It is as simple as that. Do you believe we should act on tax reform that increases the deficit? If you agree with me that we should not be increasing the deficit with the tax reform reported back from the committee, then vote for this amendment or, if necessary, vote for waiving the point of order that may be raised. I urge my colleagues, if you are seri-ous about the deficit, we shouldn’t be passing legislation that increases it. Mr. President, I reserve the remain-der of my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Wyoming. Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. Budget rules don’t accommodate cur-rent tax policy. This means at least $460 billion of scored revenue loss can be attributed to the difference between a current law baseline and a current policy baseline. Many of the tax ex-tenders covered by this amount are popular and are supported on a bipar-tisan basis. This amendment is corrosive to the budget resolution’s privilege. It falls outside the scope of what is appro-priate for inclusion. Adoption of corro-sive amendments could be fatal to the resolution’s privilege, and loss of privi-lege could compromise our ability to pass tax reform and to enforce the budget spending limits. Further, this amendment is also non-germane. The Congressional Budget Act requires that amendments to a budget resolution be germane—a statu-tory regulation we can’t ignore. So I raise a point of order against this amendment under the Budget Act’s section 305(b)(2). The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Maryland. Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, what the chairman is saying is, basically, the process will be used in order to add to the deficit. Therefore, pursuant to sec-tion 904 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive section 305(b) of that act for purposes of the pending amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient sec-ond. The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk called the roll. Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. MENEN -

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Virginia. 
AMENDMENT NO . 1249 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1249. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending. Mr. KAINE. The amendment is a sim-ple amendment, folks. It is about transparency. Two years ago, the Sen-ate passed a budget that added a lauda-tory requirement to have a Congres-sional Budget Office score for reconcili-ation legislation 28 hours in advance of voting on the legislation. There are ob-vious benefits to the Members who are voting and obvious benefits to the American public. The budget resolution before us from committee repeals that requirement. The majority has argued that it is un-necessary because the requirement has never been triggered. But I remember that just a couple of months ago, the Senate was debating healthcare legis-lation that hadn’t seen the light of day and didn’t have a CBO score. Do we really believe the answer to our problem is to make it easier to pass legislation without knowing the cost? I think the 28-hour requirement is worthy, it should be continued, and I think it should be extended to include amendments in the nature of a sub-stitute. I ask all my colleagues to support transparency and not embarrass the in-stitution by enabling us to more easily pass important legislation without the public knowing the score. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator’s time has expired. The Senator from Wyoming. Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. The congressional budget clearly em-powers the Budget Committee chair as scorekeeper. Since becoming chairman in 2015, I am pleased to say that the Budget Committee has always dis-charged its responsibilities with scores in hand, proving our important work and function without this amendment. In fact, the 28-hour rule is a recent cre-ation, and its repeal shows no devi-ation from Senate practice. It would require 28 hours on every amendment. It is also important to note that a budget resolution is not a law. Because it is not a law, it cannot supersede or replace any statutory provisions. The Congressional Budget Act is a law and sets forth the rules that the congres-sional budget must follow. The proposed amendment attempts to make a significant change to section 402 of the Congressional Budget Act, which should be accomplished through regular order legislation which the President signs. I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amend-ment. Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient sec-ond. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk called the roll. Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. M

AMENDMENT NO . 1298 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 2 minutes of debate, equal-ly divided, prior to a vote in relation to Paul amendment No. 1298. The Senator from Kentucky. Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, this amendment is about the debt. We have a $20 trillion debt. It is about whether we are serious about tackling that debt. The budget before us exceeds our own spending caps by $43 billion. You will be told that technically that is not so because we hide the money by sticking it in an account we call the Overseas Contingency Operations. Over the past 3 years, we have spent more than $1.7 trillion in this account, but we don’t account for it, and we don’t budget for it. What I am asking us to do is to be responsible, budget for this, stay within our self-imposed caps, and actually act as though we really be-lieve in what we say—that the debt is a problem. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Wyoming. Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. The amendment seeks to reduce discre-tionary appropriations this fiscal year by $43 billion. As Members are aware, the resolution’s discretionary figures for this fiscal year are fully consistent with the Budget Control Act spending limits. If they weren’t, then the resolu-tion would be subject to a 60-vote point of order. This year’s resolution also includes Overseas Contingency Operations fund-ing at $77 billion. This amount is equal to the President’s request and is allow-able under the Budget Control Act. The

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES6624 October 19, 2017 
members of the Budget Committee worked hard to craft a resolution with levels that would put us on a better fis-cal path, with $5.1 trillion in spending reductions over the next 10 years. The resolution already contains ample re-straint to both discretionary and man-datory spending. As the Appropriations Committee has reported many of its bills already, this amendment could be detrimental to the appropriations process as it stands today and the allocation this resolution will provide. I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 minute. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I agree with my colleague that there are no recommendations on where these cuts are coming from. Do they come from the programs that support our Nation’s veterans, from the National Institutes of Health—the cutting-edge cancer re-search it conducts? You can’t turn re-search on and off. Scientists don’t hit pause. Does it come from our transportation and infrastructure? If we really want to make these cuts—and this, of course, would take us well below the postsequester budget caps that are al-ready $43 billion. If we want to make cuts, have the courage to stand up and say ‘‘This is the program I want to cut’’—not do something like this, where we don’t know if the cut will be for veterans, education, cancer re-search, or anything else. I oppose the amendment. To reiterate, I oppose the Paul amendment and urge others to do the same. The Paul amendment appears to mandate a cut of $43 billion from non-defense discretionary programs in fis-cal year 2018. This is an 8-percent cut to the fiscal year 2018 postsequester budget caps, which are already $3 bil-lion below last year’s levels. It could impact defense as well. Of course, Senator P
AULprovides no recommendations on who he wants to hurt. Should it come from programs that support our Nation’s veterans? Should it come from the National In-stitutes of Health and the cutting-edge cancer research it conducts? You can-not just turn research on and off. Sci-entists do not hit pause. What if we take it from transportation and infra-structure programs that help repair our Nation’s failing roads and bridges? If those are unacceptable, perhaps we should cut or eliminate programs that assist our Nation’s farmers or help pro-mote economic growth in rural com-munities. I think we can all agree that is not going to happen. It should not happen. We should be investing in our communities to make sure they have the tools they need to grow and flour-ish, not deserting them. Members on both sides of the aisle have been calling for months for a bi-partisan budget deal. In speech after speech we have heard about the dev-astating consequences that sequester has on both defense and nondefense programs. If we are going to finish this year’s appropriations process, we need a bipartisan budget deal based on par-ity that provides us relief from seques-ter. This amendment takes us in the opposite direction. I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time has expired. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. Mr. PAUL. I ask for the yeas and nays.

Mr. President, I am offering amendment No. 1430 to repeal ObamaCare regulations that are wreak-ing havoc on our health insurance mar-ket. Healthcare costs are rising dra-matically, unsustainably, and unaffordably. Healthcare costs are rising as a re-sult of ObamaCare’s despotic regime of aggressive healthcare regulations. Countless working families are tread-ing water just to try to stay afloat. A good chunk of these costs also can be pinned directly on the burdensome ObamaCare regulations. According to one HHS study, ObamaCare regulations caused pre-miums in the individual market to spike an astounding 105 percent, and a study by Milliman showed that the guaranteed issue regulation alone caused health insurance premiums to rise by an average of 45 percent. This amounts to $106 per month. That is thousands of dollars per year for work-ing families. That is money that they could be spending on groceries, on housing, on braces, or on their child’s education. Congress has done very little in the last few years to alleviate the burdens faced by these working class families. I urge my colleagues to act now by sup-porting this amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Washington. Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, Re-publicans have now put forward pro-posal after proposal to rip protections away from Americans with preexisting conditions. This amendment is yet an-other example of Republican efforts to increase costs for people who need healthcare the most. It would put in-surance companies back in charge. It would allow them to deny coverage to people with preexisting conditions or discriminate against them by charging higher premiums. This repeals the essential health ben-efits, rips away access to critical serv-ices like maternity care, mental health, and substance use disorder treatment, and repeals the requirement that coverage be available to depend-ents under the age of 26. Americans have rejected this crass partisan proposal. It is long past time to focus on bipartisan proposals like the one that Senator ALEXANDER and I announced today that actually pro-tects people with preexisting condi-tions while bringing down premiums for patients and family. I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote. Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unani-mous consent to speak for 10 seconds. Mrs. MURRAY. I object. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-tion is heard. Mr. LEE. I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient sec-ond. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant bill clerk called the roll. Mr. CORNYN. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator from Mississippi (Mr. C

AMENDMENT NO . 1277 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 2 minutes of debate, equal-ly divided, prior to a vote in relation to Paul amendment No. 1277. The Senator from Kentucky. Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, across the country, Republicans promised to re-peal ObamaCare. They promised to re-peal all of ObamaCare, root and branch. Not one Republican promised to keep and block grant ObamaCare. They promised to repeal ObamaCare. Tonight I present another chance. My amendment will provide budget reconciliation instructions so Repub-lican Senators can fulfill their prom-ise; so they can actually repeal ObamaCare, root and branch, as they promised. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Oregon. Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, this amendment provides reconciliation in-structions to three Senate committees for the purpose of repealing and replac-ing the Affordable Care Act; in effect, rerunning the same bad movie the Sen-ate has now seen three times. By now, Americans understand what these par-tisan Republican healthcare bills have in store for the middle class: higher premiums, worse healthcare, and a safety net in tatters. I will close by saying that there is now a desire on both sides of the aisle to set aside this my-way-or-the-high-way approach to governing. Bipartisan-ship is about taking each other’s good ideas, and I believe the Senate can work together to lower people’s pre-miums. This amendment is a vote to look for more partisan ideological trophies when the Senate ought to be working together to find common ground. I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amend-ment. Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient sec-ond. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant bill clerk called the roll. Mr. CORNYN.

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, for the in-formation of Senators, we expect to have this series of votes and then move to passage of the resolution. That means there are hopefully approxi-mately eight votes left. Some of them may be voice votes. Mr. President, I yield to the leader. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-jority leader. Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, I say to colleagues, the consent agree-ment that was just entered allows us to see the light at the end of the tunnel. If Senators will stay in the Chamber, we will do these 10-minute rollcall votes and wrap it up. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader. Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader. We com-pletely agree on this issue. We hope Members on both sides will stay in their seats so we can finish quickly, without going through the ridiculous vote-arama that we have done in pre-vious years. I yield the floor. AMENDMENT NO . 1553 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 2 minutes of debate, equal-ly divided, prior to a vote in relation to Udall amendment No. 1553. The Senator from New Mexico. Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, this amendment calls for legislation to fully and permanently fund the Pay-ment in Lieu of Taxes Program. Sen-ator H
EINRICH and I have long called for this solution. Rural counties in New Mexico and other States across the West and across the country have large amounts of Federal lands within their boundaries. These counties rely on funding from the PILT Program to provide better schools, maintain roads and bridges, and support thousands of local jobs. We currently fund PILT year by year. I have fought for this funding as a member of the Appropriations Com-mittee, but we need to do more. We need to pass permanent funding to en-sure that local communities can count on our resources being there every year to provide basic services. I urge sup-port for the Udall-Heinrich amendment and yield back. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? The Senator from Wyoming. Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, reluctantly. I have always fought to make sure the rural communities can keep the lights on. Approximately half of the land in my home State of Wyo-ming is under Federal control, and counties, therefore, are unable to ob-tain property tax revenue from a large part of the State. Payment in lieu of taxes isn’t a give-away to these counties. It is compensa-tion for the money they lose because they are unable to tax Federal lands within their borders, even though they are required to provide services on those lands. However, this resolution already has the reserved funds for the Payment in Lieu of Taxes Program. I find this amendment to be duplicative and unnecessary. Furthermore, the vote-arama isn’t the correct forum to contemplate making any program per-manent and mandatory, even one I have long supported. I look forward to working with my colleague from New Mexico and with other interested Members from West-ern States on fiscally responsible legis-lation to provide fairness and equity for America’s rural counties and their communities. I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amend-ment. Mr. UDALL. I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6627 October 19, 2017 
The Senator from Utah. Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I am offering this amendment to pay back western communities for the loss that occurs to them as a result of the widespread own-ership of Federal public land. As I have long stressed, Federal land is often a bad bargain for State and local governments, like those in Utah, where almost two-thirds of the land is owned and controlled by the Federal Government, thus prohibiting local governments from taxing that land. Not only does Federal ownership re-duce economic opportunity on that land, not only does it rob local resi-dents of local control, but it also shrinks the property tax base that Utahns rely on to fund essential com-munity services. The Payments in Lieu of Taxes Pro-gram, or PILT, was designed to address this very inequity by paying States for the property tax revenue they lost as a result of Federal land ownership, but the current formula for PILT does not adequately compensate local govern-ments for this loss. In fact, it doesn’t even come close. My amendment offers these predominantly rural commu-nities a revisited, revised, and im-proved PILT formula to compensate them for these very losses. I encourage my colleagues to support it, and I request a voice vote. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Washington. Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, there is wide support for PILT from both Democrats and Republicans, as witnessed by this last vote. What we need to do now is to make sure that it works fairly for counties and is not done arbitrarily. The CRS found that taking the ap-proach in Senator L
EE’s amendment would break the PILT Program. Not only would calculating each county’s payments be nearly impossible, the program would not be fair. In fact, the CRS cited a 2010 study that found that the approach in Senator L
EE’s amend-ment would result in two-thirds of all of the counties that receive PILT fund-ing receiving lower payments than they do now. I urge my colleagues to vote no. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amend-ment. Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient sec-ond.

AMENDMENT NO . 1404 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. K EN-
NEDY ). There will now be 2 minutes of debate, equally divided, prior to a vote in relation to Paul amendment No. 1404. The Senator from Kentucky. Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, rather than bicker over raising taxes on some people and lowering taxes on other peo-ple, we should cut everyone’s taxes to make sure we get a middle-class tax cut across the board. The best way to do that is to give the tax committee a mandate that is larger, a mandate for a bigger tax cut. My amendment provides budget rec-onciliation instructions to increase the tax cut to $2.5 trillion. If we were to be-lieve this budget, it claims to save over $6 trillion over 10 years—more than enough to go bigger, better, and bolder on cutting taxes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Vermont. Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the Paul amendment. In the budget we are de-bating today, my Republican col-leagues have required the Finance Committee to increase the deficit by $1.5 trillion over the next decade. This budget would pave the way for massive cuts to Medicare and Medicaid in order to provide the wealthiest people in this country with incredibly large tax breaks. Senator P
AULthinks that doesn’t go far enough. His amendment would allow the Senate to increase the deficit by $2.5 trillion, allowing for even great-er cuts to Medicare, to Medicaid, and even bigger tax breaks for the Koch brothers and their friends. I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on this amend-ment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amend-ment. Mr. PAUL. I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

AMENDMENT NO . 1429 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 minutes of debate, equally divided, prior to a vote in relation to Lee amendment No. 1429. The Senator from Utah. Mr. LEE. Mr. President, our con-stitutional structure puts in place a Federal Government with powers that James Madison described as ‘‘few and defined’’ and those reserved to the States as ‘‘numerous and indefinite.’’ Among other things, the Constitution gives powers to the Congress to regu-late interstate commerce, trade or commerce between the States, with foreign nations, and with Indian Tribes. It does not give the Congress the power to regulate any and every activity occurring intrastate. Yet, for the last few decades, under the Endan-gered Species Act, this very power has been abused to regulate species that exists only in one place, only within one State, never crossing State lines, never forming any part of any channel or instrumentality of interstate com-merce. This is wrong, it is unconstitu-tional, and it eviscerates and cir-cumvents the meaning of the 10th Amendment. We need to liberate this country from the dictates of a few bu-reaucrats in Washington, DC, who have overextended their authority under the Endangered Species Act. My amend-ment fixes that, and I urge my col-leagues to support amendment No. 1429.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 minutes of debate, equally divided, prior to a vote in relation to Cantwell amendment No. 1301. The Senator from Washington. Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is one of the most pristine areas of the United States, and we have been protecting it for decades for a reason. The notion that tonight, after 60-plus years, we would give up what is a biologically important area, that is a critical habi-tat for polar bears, a breeding ground for caribou, migratory birds, and over 200 species—for what? For oil that we don’t need. We have had record oil production in the last 10 years—a 77-percent increase. The oil that we would get, we wouldn’t get until 10 years from now, and it would supply oil for only 1 year in the United States. It is not worth it. As Representative Mo Udall said in 1980: ‘‘If we have to drill at the White House or Arlington Cemetery or the Capitol grounds for oil, we might have to drill in the Arctic Refuge. But let us go there last.’’ We don’t need this oil. We have plen-ty of supply. The Interior Secretary is trying to open a billion acres, includ-ing on-shore and outer continental shelf waters. Vote no and protect a unique special place that has been pro-tected for 60 years. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Alaska. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to soundly reject this amendment. Those who support this amendment will deny us the op-portunity to do something constructive in this country when it comes to our opportunities to produce energy, to produce wealth. We need to be expanding our energy development in our Federal areas. This helps us reduce our deficit, build new wealth in this country, strengthen our national security and our competitive-ness. We can and we must do more as a nation to responsibly develop our re-sources, our energy resources providing economic security, energy security, and national security. The Energy Committee is prepared to meet this in-struction to raise a billion dollars over the next decade. I urge Senators to reject this amend-ment, which would deprive us of a sub-stantial opportunity to benefit our country at the same time that we care for our environment. Thank you.

AMENDMENT NO . 1561 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 minutes of debate, equally divided, prior to a vote in relation to Enzi amendment No. 1561. The Senator from Wyoming. Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, first of all, I want to thank everybody who has gotten us to this point. There is this vote, and I hope there will be one voice vote after it and then final passage. I am urging my colleagues to support this amendment. This amendment of-fers technical and conforming changes that are needed for the House of Rep-resentatives to be able to enforce the budget resolution. This amendment will help maintain fiscal discipline in the House so both Chambers can con-tinue to work and put America on a more sustainable footing. What is also important for my colleagues to know is that these provisions apply to the House only. The Senate enforcement remains unchanged. I hope you will support me on this amendment. I yield the floor and reserve the re-mainder of my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Vermont. Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, Chair-man E

amendment paves the way for a $91 bil-lion increase in defense spending in fis-cal year 2018. This amendment would renew the Re-publican effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act and throw up to 32 million Americans off of the health insurance they currently have, increase pre-miums for older workers, and make even more harmful cuts to Medicaid. This amendment includes a provision requiring the use of so-called dynamic scoring, or what President George H.W. Bush appropriately referred to as voo-doo economics, allowing the Repub-licans to claim that their massive tax breaks for the rich will pay for them-selves. At a time when the cost of college education is skyrocketing, this amend-ment calls for dramatic cuts to student financial aid. I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

AMENDMENT NO . 1167 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 minutes of debate, equally divided, prior to a vote in relation to the Perdue-Whitehouse amendment No. 1167. The Senator from Georgia. Mr. PERDUE. Mr. President, I have great news. This is the last amendment and the only bipartisan amendment to-night, and after this we will vote on the entire bill. The purpose of this amendment is to declare this process—the vote-arama— utter nonsense. It is part of a budget process that both parties have per-petrated and persisted with for 43 years. It has only worked four times; to fund the Federal Government, ac-cording to the Budget Act of 1974, four times in our history. We are supposed to appropriate 12 bills a year to fund the Government. We have averaged 21⁄2. I urge all of my colleagues to make clear to the American people that we recognize this budgeting process is bro-ken and we are committed to fix it. Thank you. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Rhode Island. Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am pleased to urge all of my colleagues to give a strong bipartisan voice vote in support of the amendment by the Senator from Georgia. The current budget process does not produce a meaningful budget, does not control the debt or the deficit, and does not contribute to bipartisanship or com-promise. What it does produce is a meaningless, partisan vote-arama. If you believe we can do better than a vote-arama, if you believe we can have an improved and meaningful budget process, voice vote aye. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amend-ment. The amendment (No. 1167) was agreed to. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Wyoming. Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I know of no further amendments to the resolu-tion. 
AMENDMENT NO . 1116, AS AMENDED  
The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 2 minutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 1116, as amended. Mr. ENZI. That is the substitute. I yield back time on that. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Vermont. Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, this is not a bad budget bill. It is a horrific budget bill, an extremely cruel bill, and the most unfair budget ever pre-sented in the modern history of our country. At a time of massive income and wealth inequality, this budget provides $1.9 trillion in tax breaks for the top 1 percent. At a time when millions of working families are struggling to keep their heads above water, this budget cuts Medicaid by $1 trillion. Fifteen million Americans could lose their health insurance. This is a budget that poll after poll shows the American people do not want. Let us defeat it. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Wyoming. Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I am tempt-ed to debate that, but we will get to do that as we do the provisions of this after it is all voted on. I hope everybody will adopt the sub-stitute by voice, and then vote on adoption of the resolution. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any further amendments? Seeing none, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 1116, as amended. The amendment (No. 1116) in the na-ture of a substitute, as amended, was agreed to. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

THANKING SENATOR ENZI AND THE BUDGET  
COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND STAFF  
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes following the re-marks of the majority leader to thank Chairman E
NZI, the bill manager, and the whole Budget Committee for the tremendous work that has been done on this budget resolution. I also want to express my gratitude and our collective gratitude to the Budget Committee staff, who has done such heroic work to get us this far. This might well be the best and most well-run budget consideration process during my time in the Senate. Cer-tainly, for the fact that Senator E
NZI has gotten us to this point at this time of night, when typically this ends in the wee hours of the morning, I think he is to be commended. The resolution has gone through reg-ular order from the start, working its way through the Budget Committee where amendments were considered and adopted from both sides. Chairman E
NZIhas been a very effective floor manager as we have been considering the budget resolution, obtaining con-sensus from both sides of the aisle to ensure that the Senate has considered a number of amendments in a timely fashion. That is something that is not always so common around here. I want to take a moment to note the great job the chairman has done in get-ting us to this point. As we all know, without a budget resolution, there will be no tax reform. This is the first step to getting us to pro-growth tax reform, which will unshackle the sleeping giant of the American economy, something from which all Americans will benefit. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from New Jersey. 
THE BUDGET  
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, hav-ing been away for a while from the Senate, I am pretty amazed to come back today and see a budget that is passed that throws away years of rhet-oric about fiscal conservatism. The Senate just passed a budget that adds $1.5 trillion to our national debt, a budget that slashes seniors’ healthcare by $473 billion. It decimates the Med-icaid Program for parents and grand-parents in nursing homes, those who are disabled, and those who are among the poorest, with cuts of over $1 tril-lion over the next decade. In total, the Republican budget would cut more than $5 trillion over the next decade from education, healthcare, affordable housing, childcare, nutrition assistance, trans-portation, and other programs that all Americans rely on. The question many New Jerseyans will be asking me is, Why? Why do Re-publicans in Congress add $1.5 trillion

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6631 October 19, 2017 
to our national debt while slashing the Medicare Program? The answer is sim-ple. We are on a pathway to provide massive tax breaks to corporate inter-ests, special interests, and the wealthi-est 1 percent. This has been a Repub-lican agenda for as long as I can re-member. What I find most galling is that this budget plan is meant to set up a special process that we know here as reconcili-ation to pass the Trump tax plan—a plan, which, by which their own admis-sion, will raise taxes on middle-class families. Think about that. The Repub-lican Party is adding $1.5 billion to the debt to pay for massive tax breaks for the wealthiest among us—I should say trillion, $1.5 trillion to the debt to pay for massive tax breaks for the wealthi-est among us. They aren’t even guaran-teeing that middle-class taxes will not go up. What the Republican budget fails to realize is that budgets are not just about numbers. Budgets are about peo-ple, their hopes, their dreams, their ex-pectations for a better life for them-selves and their children. My view is that this budget sells America short. It is not what the American people believe our collective values would be. Hard-working families want us to work together and pass a budget that addresses their concerns. They want safe communities, not a budget that threatens to cut the fire-fighter grants and stretches local budg-ets even thinner. They want peace of mind when they reach their golden years, not a budget that raises their healthcare costs. They want a tax pro-posal that cuts taxes for the middle class and working people, not more tax breaks for the folks that have been rig-ging the system against us. People are willing to do their part if everyone is sharing in the sacrifice. But this budget fails that test. It fails to recognize that we are all in this to-gether and should benefit together and sacrifice together—each of us working for the betterment of all of us. Mr. President, another area where it is critical that we come together, not as 50 separate States but as the United States of America, is to help the 3.5 million American citizens living in Puerto Rico. I have serious concerns that the current disaster relief package currently being considered by Congress falls far short of that. Tomorrow will mark 1 month since Hurricane Maria devastated the island of Puerto Rico, leaving in its wake a trail of destruction, despair, and suf-fering. It is 1 month later, and still 88 percent of our fellow Americans in Puerto Rico don’t have power. It is 1 month later, and still one-third of the island lacks access to clean, safe drink-ing water. Outside of the city of San Juan, the situation is even worse, as nearly two- thirds of people still remain without water. Let me just pause for a moment to think about that. Think about it: an entire month without clean water, without water to bathe, to cook with, or simply to drink. How many of us can even imagine such an existence? More than half of the island’s cell towers are down, which is not just an inconven-ience. It is a threat to safety. Imagine the sense of isolation and desperation when your power is out, when you have run out of potable water, with none on the way, and you can’t even call for help. As bad as it looks on TV, the situa-tion on the ground, as I saw it, is trag-ically worse. I am concerned that the package we are considering now is both inadequate in scope and unfair in treat-ment—inadequate because it is just a fraction of what Puerto Rico needs to recover, unfair because it treats the people of Puerto Rico different than Florida and Texas, even though they are U.S. citizens. While all three areas have been dev-astated by natural disasters, only Puerto Rico is being required to pay back natural disaster assistance. That is right. Unlike Florida and Texas, the majority of Puerto Rico’s assistance is coming in the form of a loan. While there are a lot of things that the people of Puerto Rico need from their Federal Government, one thing they absolutely do not need and simply cannot afford is billions of dollars of more debt. This is not a normal disaster loan. No. Just like everything else with Puerto Rico, this loan comes with a major stipulation. While disaster loans are normally forgiven according to a standard formula under the Stafford Act, this package overrules long-standing law and leaves the decision entirely in the hands of the Secretaries of the Treasury and Homeland Secu-rity. While disaster loans are normally used to help people be safe and start the recovery process, this legislation gives the Secretaries of the Treasury and Homeland Security the authority to control how Puerto Rico spends the money. If Secretary Mnuchin decides that some, most, or even all of the loan should be used to pay off his friends on Wall Street, there is nothing Puerto Rico can do to stop him. If he decides that debt bondholders are more impor-tant than those who are suffering in darkness, there is nothing they can do to stop him. Instead of being treated like the rest of the country, Puerto Rico is left at the mercy of Treasury Secretary Mnuchin. They are at the mercy of someone who made his for-tune off the backs of seniors and hard- working families who lost their homes in the foreclosure crisis. Do we really think that someone who callously rejected the pleas of strug-gling families to save their homes and instead put them on the fast track to foreclosure is going to suddenly change now for the 3.5 million American citi-zens in Puerto Rico? Does anyone real-ly believe he is going to put the people of Puerto Rico first? What a tragedy it would be if, instead of helping our most vulnerable citizens, this loan was used to pay off, in whole or in part, vulture funds. We need people saved, not bond-holders. We need a response that answers Puerto Rico’s call. Instead of con-tinuing to treat Puerto Rico like a for-eign country and make them start a tab at the U.S. Treasury while they are vulnerable and pleading for help, we need to treat them just like their fel-low American citizens in Florida and Texas. We need to provide uncondi-tional assistance—real dollars to re-build roads, the electrical grid, and to put people back in their homes and businesses. We need to address the massive Medicaid cliff that is forcing even more doctors and nurses off the island and threatening the health of the people of Puerto Rico. We need strong protections to make sure that the disaster relief stays with the people of Puerto Rico, where it is needed the most. Let me close by saying that I grew up believing the United States was the greatest country the world had ever seen. I still believe that today as strongly as ever. Ultimately, our re-sponse as it relates to the people of Puerto Rico is not just about the peo-ple of Puerto Rico but about all of us. It is about our values—who we are as a people, who we are as a nation. How we respond to this crisis will test the col-lective conscience of our Nation, and it will define us. As I have said many times, I have never shied away from voting for as-sistance for flooding in Mississippi, for wildfires in the West, for hurricanes like Katrina, and any other natural disaster that has faced our country with our fellow Americans. I was amazed when I had to struggle and fight here on the Senate floor for the first time—I don’t know—in my life-time to get assistance in the New York-New Jersey area after Superstorm Sandy. It took a major fight, with people voting no, even though I had always voted yes. The people of Puerto Rico do not have a U.S. Senator to cast their vote for them or to raise their voices for them. Yet, as long as I am a Member of this Chamber, I am going to continue to prick the conscience of the Senate to understand that when we walk to the Vietnam wall and see those names, a disproportionate number of them are Americans of Puerto Rican descent, who wore the uniform, gave their lives, and made the ultimate sacrifice. They did not leave the conflict early; they gave it their all. We cannot leave them early, nor should we leave them short. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Wyoming.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES6632 October 19, 2017 
does outline a plan for what we can do over 10 years. That is a long time. I don’t know that we ever make it past the first year. In fact, some budgets do not last more than 40 days before we waive the budget, but we need to have a blueprint. This is a blueprint that covers 10 years in spite of some of the rhetoric that this bill will not do any of the things that have been claimed. The reason that it will not do any of the things that have been claimed is that everything in the budget requires action by another committee before it can be done. Maybe they will take what we have in the budget and do that. Usually, they do not. If they were to, we could balance it, in this case, over a 10-year period. That is too long. Interest is going to eat us alive before that time. We are going to have to do something else. I remember, when President Obama came into office, he had an idea. He said that the economy was too slug-gish, so he was going to do a stimulus bill. Here, they are complaining about this $1.5 trillion that, perhaps, might be part of the flexibility for doing tax reform. We did more than that in the stimulus, and it did not work and went into the hands of a few people. Some of it never did get used. Some of it went to very few people. It was supposed to go to shovel-ready projects. Some of those projects have not been done yet, so that did not work. We have had a slow economy. In fact, it seemed to have been slowing down, not speeding up, until last November. Last November, people showed a sign of hope, and the economy started going the other way. It is reflected in the stock market and some of the com-modity prices because they felt that those could be produced again. We decided that we had to try a dif-ferent approach, and the different ap-proach was to try to put the money in the hands of hard-working Americans. That is the middle class that some of the people talk about, and it is the poor that some of the people talk about. It is everybody. When we do tax reform, it will affect everybody. In fact, there are even some studies that show that when you do the corporate tax, it increases money for individuals who are working because there will be more competition for people, and that will drive up wages. Some economists have pointed that out. Yet, rather than argue with the Congressional Budget Office about how much the change is going to be, we said: No. Go ahead. Do your static one just as though no change had been made at all. We are willing to bet that there will be a very slight increase that will cover what we are talking about as a possible deficit and that that deficit will not develop if we increase just a very small amount in productivity. Just about every economist asked: How come you are picking such a low number? Well, we try to be conserv-ative and hope that the number goes 4 or 5 or 6 points higher than that. If it does, we will have money to start pay-ing back some of the debt. If it just stays at my estimated, conservative amount, at the end of 10 years, we will have a surplus of $197 billion. We have a chance to put America on a different route, one that will increase jobs, one that will get the money into the hands of the people, realizing that they probably know better what to do for themselves and their families than we do. I do hear a lot when I go home about different government programs that are not working. In my studies, I have found that we not only have programs that are not working but that we have programs that nobody ever takes a look at. We have programs that have a lot of duplication. We have 160 housing programs. There are really only 5 things that those 160 programs do, so shouldn’t we have just 5 of them and maybe have them specifically and all under one agency and set some goals and see if they meet those goals? I was visiting with a lady from Africa who happens to be in charge of finance in her country. She said: You know, we have performance contracts in our country, and a performance contract means that everybody, including the towns, does a list of what they are going to get done during the year. Because they are smaller than the United States, once a year they get ev-erybody together who has a perform-ance contract, and everybody reviews his performance contract. If you do not meet your performance contract, there is a little bit of public embarrassment; whereas we do not even check to see if they did anything. We do not even check to see if they have plans. We have to change that, and some of the things in this budget will allow that to happen. I appreciate the way that we finished up in committee. I allowed the other side to see the budget early. Normally, they get to see it after opening state-ments are done. Imagine that—do the opening statement about what you think is going to be in the budget. Al-though some of the speakers I have heard around here act like they are still thinking that something might be in the budget that is not, they got to see it 5 days early in exchange for sub-mitting their amendments, which is what every other committee does. Sub-mit the amendments early, and then we can look through them and see how much duplication there is and some that can be accepted from both sides. As a result, we started with over 150 amendments, and we voted on 25. We took five from the other side, making it a bipartisan budget. Nevertheless, after the committee process, we brought it to the floor, and we had an open amendment process today. In fact, as for the way the rules are on this, after we voted on the last amendment—of course, before we voted on final passage—somebody could have said: Wait a minute, I have one more, and he could have gone on all night. Again, we had to think of a civil proc-ess today that would result in our being able to finish at what would be considered an extremely early hour. There was a little different tone to the amendments than what I had seen before—I think people will agree with that—which was that they were fo-cused on the actual items in the budg-et, not on ‘‘gotcha’’ amendments. Usu-ally, they say: Well, that person is up, and he has this little soft spot, so if I throw in this amendment, he will be on record, probably, having to vote against it, or he will vote for it, and that can be used against him. Either way, they would be able to use it. I didn’t see those amendments this time, and I appreciate that. I appreciate my colleagues for their consideration, their cooperation, and a lot of patience that has gotten us to this point. I thank Leader M
ITCH MCCONNELL for allowing the Senators to do their jobs, to do them in committee, and to do them here on the Senate floor. This commitment to an open, honest, and transparent legislative process is cru-cial to helping Congress restore the trust of the American people. I also owe thanks to the outstanding members of the Senate Budget Com-mittee, who fought so hard and so te-naciously to outline a plan that could balance the budget over the next 10 years while providing the tools needed to reform our Tax Code and boost the economy. The Presiding Officer was a part of that committee, and the Sen-ator who just finished presiding was a part of that committee. I appreciate the careful and calculated way they looked at it, provided suggestions, then asked good questions at hearings and helped to come up with that budget. Thanks are due, as well, to the many Members on this side who came and spoke on the budget’s behalf, who of-fered amendments to make it better— well, almost always to make it better— and who worked with each of us and each other to move through the resolu-tion’s debate and the vote process to-gether. I would also like to focus for a mo-ment on some of the staff who helped to lead us here. I want to thank the Re-publican staff of the Senate Budget Committee. That is Betsy McDonnell, my staff director, who is relatively new to the position, but you would never know that in the way she took ahold with her knowledge and friendship among people, again, on both sides of the aisle. She has been able to work some wonders to where we had the least votes in a vote-arama that, I think, we have ever had. That came from her being able to combine some of them but also in helping them redraft so that they were covering a different area than somebody else might be cov-ering, which eliminated some of the repetition. I want to thank my deputy staff di-rector, Matt Giroux, and Paul Vinovich, Becky Cole, Thomas Fuller,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6633 October 19, 2017 
Elizabeth Keys, Joe Brenckle, Jim Neill, Steve Robinson, Greg D’Angelo, Tom Borck, Richard Berger, Jeremy Dalrymple, David Ditch, Susan Eckerly, Alison McGuire, Will Morris, Steve Townsend, Kelsie Wendelberger, and our interns Catherine Konieczny, Jake Whitaker, and Matt Pfeiffer. They are quite a team that has been doing a lot of work, both daytime and night and while the Senate has been out of session. So I would also like to offer a special thank-you to Eric Ueland, who pre-viously served as my staff director. He has been nominated for a post within the administration, and he is still wait-ing for his vote here, which is being de-layed a lot—not just on his but appar-ently on all of them. Eric has played an important role on this committee and throughout his time in the Senate. Two years ago, Eric was instrumental in helping Con-gress approve its first balanced 10-year budget since 2001, which represented an important step toward putting our country on not just another course but a better course. He is careful, precise, and dogged in his work. He has a tre-mendous knowledge of the history of the Senate and particularly the budget process. I especially appreciate his un-derstanding of the complex Senate rules and precedents, along with the Budget Act. I wish him Godspeed in his next position in service to our great Nation. As well, thanks are due to my per-sonal office staff who have to carry a load because I am not there when I am working on the budget stuff, but they keep me well informed so we are pro-gressing on some of the State stuff at the same time. I particularly have to thank my chief of staff, Tara Shaw, who, because a new administration came in and liked the employees I had working for me, hired many of them away and we had to find replacements and she did an outstanding job with that. She has helped to kind of hold me together during this whole process and gives me outstanding advice so that I know not only what I am doing but why I am doing it, and, again, she has a tremendous history of what I have done before, which helps me as a good reminder. She is an outstanding chief of staff. I also want to include my legislative director, Landon Stropko. When you are the budget chairman and you are worried about some of the numbers, you can give the legislative director a heart attack because as budget direc-tor you have to vote against some things that have some unusual num-bers to it, but it might be something people in Wyoming are interested in. We were able to resolve some of those conflicts. I always support Wyoming, as I mentioned. For anything that hap-pens in the budget process, there is an-other process that will actually require some votes to finish up anything that is in there, and we will see that every-thing in there comes out in Wyoming’s favor as well as for the rest of the Na-tion. I am not trying to do anything partial just to our part of the country, although a lot of things I work on have to do with very rural places. We are the least populated State in the Nation, but we are also the biggest State in the Nation so we have a lot of open space to invite people to. I also want to thank Bart Massey, Liz Schwartz, Natalia Riggin, Aniela Butler, Charlie Carroll, Shawna Newsome, Garnett Decosimo, Chris Lydon, Aron Wehr, and Dylan Mitchell. I want to thank my Communications Director, Coy Knobel, our press team, Max D’Onofrio and Rachel Vliem, and the rest of the Wyoming team. I have a bunch of people in Wyoming who primarily work on casework and do an outstanding job doing that. I also want to thank the Budget Committee’s bipartisan staff: Kim Proctor, Katie Smith, George Woodall, Grace Bruno, and Kevin Walsh, as well as Celina Inman, who has been on loan to us from the Government Publishing Office. You can tell around here it takes a lot of government printing. We have also been supported by the great work of our leadership, the floor and cloak room staff. I thank them for their continued good work and dedica-tion to this institution and the country as a whole. In particular, I want to thank Sharon Soderstrom, Hazen Marshall, Jane Lee, and Brendan Dunn in the leader’s of-fice; Monica Popp, John Chapuis, and Emily Kirlin in the whip’s office; and very especially Laura Dove, who really runs this place. She has a history from when her dad was the Parliamentarian, and I am sure there was dinner table talk that has led her to know a lot of the precedents. I have seen when some-body disagreed with her, she was able to just go over and pull out a manual and turn almost instantly to the page and say: Here it is. She does an out-standing job of helping us stay on the right track. I also thank Robert Dun-can, Chris Tuck, Megan Mercer, Tony Hanagan, Mike Smith, Katherine Kil-roy, and Chloe Barz in the cloakroom. I would really be remiss if I didn’t thank the Senate Parliamentarian, Elizabeth MacDonough, and her team, along with our bill and amendment clerks who kept us on the straight and narrow, but I particularly want to point out our Senate Parliamentarian who has to go through the technical details of every sentence of everything we do. When you talk about a filing cabinet of ideas all contained in one place, she does it. She knows prece-dent. She has been working at it for a long time. To be Parliamentarian, you have to be somebody who really likes detail work and pressure because when somebody comes in, they don’t say: Take a look at this, and maybe I will see what you think next week. No, they want to know right now what you think, and fortunately she is able to, with a very great personality, say: Not yet, and then she does her research and comes up with some great expla-nations—not ones we always agree with—but great explanations for any decision she makes, and we really ap-preciate that. So you can see that it takes a whole lot of people, and I haven’t had a chance to get the list of the people from the other side of the aisle who have been working on, in some cases countering what we are doing and keeping their people informed, but that is the Senate; that is, there are all these people behind the scenes who are helping to make it work and to do it right. That is important. We want to do it right. Now, I think we could work together a lot better if we were able to work in smaller bites. I get a little upset when we do comprehensive stuff around here. I have watched so many times when we take a comprehensive bill and soundly defeat it or maybe narrowly defeat it, but we defeat it. I figured out, when we do something that ought to be in sepa-rate bites, that this piece loses 5 votes and this piece loses 10 votes and this piece loses 12 votes, and pretty quickly you don’t have a majority anymore, but if you do it in smaller bites, you may lose 5 votes, lose 12 votes, and it isn’t a big deal. Getting it done would be the big deal. So if people would set-tle for working one issue and sticking to that issue and not say: No, I have this amendment that I know nobody will like, but this is such an important bill, if I could get it in there, it will make it through and hardly anybody will know—that is not legislating, and we shouldn’t be operating that way. We should be doing an item at a time, in bite sizes, so the American people can understand it, and we get it done. I think a lot of people have done a great job here, including the pages. It is late, so rather than go on—I made it to after 10 p.m. so you don’t have to have class tomorrow morning. With that, I will close. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. P
ERDUE ). The Senator from Ohio. 
TAX REFORM  
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, as we have just seen, there is no more decent or honest Senator in the U.S. Senate than the Senator from Wyoming who just spoke, and that is why we were able to expedite the process tonight. It may seem like we are here late, but, frankly, we all expected to be here until 2 or 3 or 4 in the morning, and in-stead we worked things out. He is an example of why we did, both in com-mittee and on the floor. Senator E
NZI was able to work with people, be fair, honest, and that pays off. It gave ev-erybody a fair shot. I will also say he has produced a budget that does balance, which I think most Americans agree with. As he said so well, the budget is a frame-work. So the budget itself does not have the specific policies in it. In fact, those have to go to other committees to be passed and then will be passed by

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES6634 October 19, 2017 
the full Senate and the House and signed into law by the President. What it does do is it prepares this body to do something really important and really exciting, and that is the op-portunity to reform our broken Tax Code. It is so important because it will give us a shot in the arm, in terms of our economy. It will get this economy moving again, and it is going to help people who have been left behind in this economy. Really, when we look over the past 15 years, so many people whom I represent and who are rep-resented by the other Members in this Chamber have not seen their wages go up. In fact, they have been flat, and what has gone up are expenses— healthcare expenses more than any, frankly. It is the biggest single in-crease people see in their family budg-et but also food, medicine, and tuition. We have seen flat wages, not more take-home pay, and higher expenses. What we have an opportunity to do in this tax reform bill—that is a frame-work, not a mandate—that was made possible by the budget that was passed tonight is we have set the stage for commonsense tax reform that is essen-tial to this effort to grow our economy and create more and better jobs and in-creased wages for middle-class Ameri-cans. We heard a lot of discussion about it adding to the deficit. I will just add to what has been said already. If we do this tax reform right, it will not add to the deficit. In fact, I strongly believe it will reduce the deficit over the next 10 years. Why do I say that? I am going to talk for a second about some of the things that are in good pro-growth tax reform that we are planning to implement that will actu-ally grow the economy that will result in more economic activity and more revenue coming into the Treasury. If you assume, as the Congressional Budget Office does, that we are only going to grow this economy 1.9 percent, which is a pretty paltry amount over the next 10 years—way below what the average has been for the past 30 years— then let’s say all this tax reform we are doing only grows the economy by a lit-tle bit more. Let’s say .4 percent. So instead of 1.9 percent, let’s grow the economy at 2.3 percent. That is a con-servative estimate, I believe, based on the kinds of things we are talking about. That will mean we actually not only have a revenue-neutral tax pro-posal, but we begin paying back some of the national debt by having the def-icit, once again, as it was in the years 2000 and 2001, be on a unified basis at a zero deficit. This is an exciting opportunity to help people be able to seek their goals in life but also to actually help with re-gard to the budget deficit. I agree with the chairman on that. I think we have an opportunity, if we do the right tax relief, to really help to get the budget deficit down. How does this comprehensive tax re-form help the middle class? We talked a little bit about this today. Some of-fered amendments. I offered one with regard to the business tax side of things, but I think it does it in three ways. First, it immediately helps the family budget by cutting middle-class taxes. So everything that has been laid out in terms of the proposals tonight on the tax side, we can talk about the fact that for families who are working families in this country who are mak-ing $30, $40, $50, $60,000 a year, those folks will see a reduction in their taxes which will help the family budget. The Tax Code, of course, is very com-plicated, too burdensome. One thing we are proposing is to double the standard deduction. That means for people who take the deduction now—and about two-thirds of the people I represent do—they will be able to have a dou-bling of that, from $12,000 for a family to up to $24,000 for a family. That is a 0 tax bracket for the first $24,000 in in-come. That is significant middle-class tax relief. Second, we are going to expand the child tax credit. That is really impor-tant, not just to provide relief but to help families with kids be able to af-ford childcare. Finally, we will adjust the bracket so people who are beyond the standard de-duction, double or nothing, and who don’t take advantage of the child tax credit also get tax relief. So these are ways in which folks are going to see immediate help for the family budget, but it is more than that. It is more than that. I think, frankly, the most significant part of this reform is going to be giving the economy that shot in the arm and helping to increase jobs and improve wages. That is going to happen, I think, through the business tax relief that we have talked about. First, with regard to smaller companies, the so- called passthrough companies, about three-quarters of the companies in America pay their taxes as individuals. This is the corner drugstore; this is the small manufacturing business in your town. Those folks are going to see a re-duction in their taxes on their business income so they can invest more in that business and create more jobs, and a lot of the growth is going to come from these smaller businesses. That is the 25-percent rate people are talking about as compared to, say, a 35-percent or higher rate for individuals. That is something that is fair, in part because we are also going to lower the rates for people who are in the larger businesses. These are the C corporations that are being talked about. That rate has to come down. If it does not, America will continue to lose jobs and investment overseas, and that is what is happening right now. Just in the last 24 hours, another major American company announced that they are inverting; in other words, they are going overseas. Why? Because of the Tax Code. It is amazing that the Tax Code that this Congress is respon-sible for improving is so bad that peo-ple are actually voting with their feet and leaving the country and taking jobs and investment with them. We have done research on this, we have had investigations on this, and we know what is happening. We know, as an example, that because of our Tax Code, there are almost 5,000—4,700 com-panies just in the last 13 years that have become foreign companies that otherwise would be American compa-nies. Think about that. That is the Ernst & Young study we recently saw. This is amazing. We know for a fact that it is not just about these compa-nies leaving America and going to other countries and doing these so- called inversions—becoming a foreign company—but it is also foreign compa-nies coming here and taking over U.S. companies, and, again, what is hap-pening here is that jobs and investment are going overseas. Why is this? Well, it is for a couple of reasons. One is that American compa-nies now have the highest tax rate in all of the industrialized world. So the 35-percent tax rate you hear about, that is a high rate compared to every other country in the world that we do business with. That is a negative, but it is also how we tax. We tax in a way that discourages us from bringing prof-its back to America to the point that, unbelievably, there is between $2.5 tril-lion and $3 trillion—and some say more—of earnings stuck overseas, locked out of America, which could come back here to expand plants, equipment, and jobs, to actually get this economy moving. This is a huge opportunity for us. We don’t want to see these companies go offshore. We want to see them come back. Trade policy is important. Regula-tions are important. Worker retraining programs are important. Healthcare cost containment is important. But nothing is more important than fixing this broken Tax Code if we are going to see the kind of economic growth and improvement in wages that we all hope for. There have been a lot of studies done on this, and they say that we haven’t changed our code since the mid-1980s, but every other one of our competitors have. They have all lowered their rates, and they have all gone to a sys-tem of taxation that is more efficient to get this money back to their coun-tries. In 1986, Ronald Reagan was Presi-dent. He made some great changes. That was 31 years ago. Things have changed a lot since then. By the way, back then Pete Rose was still playing for my Cincinnati Reds. That is how long ago it was. It is time for us to update this Tax Code, to modernize it, and to bring back those jobs and that investment. We can do it. We can do it because of what happened tonight. This creates the framework for us to able to do this. In a recent business roundtable sur-vey of 150 American companies—these are the CEOs—82 percent said that tax

reform that we are talking about will prompt them to increase capital spend-ing. Three-quarters of them—76 per-cent—said that it is going to increase hiring. And with this reduced tax bur-den, businesses are going to have the money to invest in their workers. I will tell you, with the tighter job market that is out there now as the economy has begun to improve, this will increase competition for workers, and this will increase wages. We know that is going to happen. Every economist agrees that this kind of tax reform is going to change behavior. Some might think it doesn’t improve the economy as much as oth-ers do, but everyone believes this will incentivize us to create more jobs and improve wages here in the United States of America. There is a group called the Congres-sional Budget Office, a nonpartisan group up here that we work with. They have a study that says that as much as 70 percent of the benefit from that lower corporate rate is going to go to the workers in terms of higher wages, better benefits. That is the way we are going to help the middle class also— not just with regard to the tax relief directly but with regard to helping to improve job creation and increase wages. So I am excited about this. I think it can happen. I think it is some-thing that is long overdue. I think it is something, frankly, that should be bipartisan. This was what the Simpson-Bowles proposal, which was a totally bipartisan proposal, said we ought to do. In fact, they took the top rate down to 28 percent—lower than anybody is talking about here. But they said that we should go to this kind of taxation we are talking about in terms of international businesses, in terms of corporations, in terms of cre-ating jobs. Two years ago, I worked with C
HUCK  S
CHUMER , who is now the Democratic leader here in the U.S. Senate, and we were asked to cochair a working group on taxation—particularly folks on the international side—and we came up with a consensus, which said that we have to fix this broken Tax Code. It is not working, and we need to bring this money back. We need to bring these jobs back by going through this kind of system we are talking about, a so- called territorial system. In the past, this has been bipartisan, and my hope is it can be again. Yes, the budget provides the frame-work for us to get this done, not on a 60-vote basis but a 50-vote basis. But we should do it with more than 60 votes. We welcome input from our Democratic colleagues. I believe, in the end, this will be bipartisan because I do believe that the vast majority of Amer-icans out there, as they understand this tax reform proposal will say: Yes, I think middle-class tax relief makes sense, and, yes, I think we should be bringing back the jobs and the invest-ment to this country. I think that is going to be something that Members will hear across this country and across this aisle. When they do, I be-lieve we will have the opportunity to have the kind of commonsense, bipar-tisan tax reform we need in this coun-try. We need to do it to be able to have a thriving American middle class, and we need to do it to have a stronger America. I am excited about this opportunity. I look forward to working with my col-leagues on both sides of the aisle. Mr. President, I yield back my time on that, but I have another matter that I need to do, the closing business.

REMEMBERING WADE NELSON Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, Wade Nelson was a friend who began his pro-fessional life as a journalist and served at many levels in public service. He was regarded as an honest profes-sional in all of his life’s work, a father and husband truly dedicated to his family, and a joy to count as a friend. His colleague and friend, Bob Secter, wrote a remembrance, which I include with this statement. It was given to those of us in attendance at Wade’s me-morial service at the Unity Temple in Oak Park, IL, on October 7, 2017. The speakers at the service included his wife, Ellen Warren, a respected jour-nalist in her own right, and his sons, Ted and Emmett. They each shared touching stories of Wade as a husband and father. Rick Kogan emceed the celebration with his own signature style and Wade’s friends Bern Colleran, Terry Kelleher, Hanke Gratteau, and musician Jon Webber each added great memories to the service. As Bob Secter wrote: 
Back in the rambunctious days of Chicago newspapers, Wade Nelson worked for the leg-endary columnist Mike Royko who sent his ‘‘legman’’ to check out a tip that Cook Coun-ty judges were issued cushier toilet paper than that stocked in public restrooms. The easy part for Nelson was grabbing samples from public toilets in the Loop courthouse, now known as the Daley Center. Obtaining tissue from a judge’s inner sanc-tum was trickier. So, Nelson made up a pretense to interview Chief Judge John Boyle, then excused him-self mid-talk to use the toilet attached to the judge’s chambers. He emerged to con-front the startled judge with the incrimi-nating evidence, and a great column was born. Charmin-gate was hardly the highlight of Nelson’s days as a reporter. Yet it dem-onstrated the resourcefulness, spunk, and droll whimsy that propelled him on a rich career path involving being press secretary for the late U.S. Senator Alan Dixon of Illi-nois, communications director for the fed-eral military base closure commission, polit-ical consultant, and chief speech writer for former Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley. That resume hardly defines the sum of Nel-son, however. Friends remember him as someone with boundless curiosity and a walking encyclopedia of knowledge about in-terests as varied as Midwestern architecture, jazz, the Cubs, anything Chicago related, the minutia of the small Southern Michigan town of Sturgis where his ancestors were early settlers in the 1800s, and the secret to the perfect martini. Edward Wade Nelson Jr. grew up in west suburban River Forest, attended Fenwick High School in Oak Park and the University of Missouri where he graduated with a degree in journalism. As a young adult and beyond, his greatest devotion was reserved for performers at Chi-cago’s varied night club, cabaret and piano bar scene where men and women who played and sang there came to embrace Nelson as an honored guest and friend. He became an au-dience fixture at venues, most now long gone, like The Acorn on Oak, Toulouse, The London House, the Green Mill, and Yvette. Nelson even came to name his family pets after 20th Century jazz legends. As Nelson climbed the rungs of journalism jobs, from City News to the suburban Wilmette Life and then the Chicago Daily News, his career tracked closely with an-other young reporter, Ellen Warren, who later became a White House correspondent for the old Knight-Ridder news service and then a columnist for the Chicago Tribune. They eventually married and had two sons. Nelson moved back to River Forest, but he rejoined Dixon in the mid-1990s when the former senator chaired a politically sensitive federal commission charged with recom-mending the closure of surplus military bases across the country. In subsequent years, Nelson served as a spokesman for then-Cook County Circuit Court Clerk Aurelia Pucinski, now an appel-late court judge, and the Illinois State Board of Education and became a program officer and grant manager at the W.K. Kellogg Foundation, a Michigan-based non-profit specializing in education grants. Wedged in between these jobs was a multiyear stint as the chief speechwriter for Richard Daley, a difficult task making Chicago’s notoriously ineloquent mayor sound eloquent. Wade is survived by his wife and sons, Ted—and his wife, Sarah—and Emmett of Chicago; a sister, Karen Nelson of Chicago; and a brother, Ted— and his wife, Terry—of Spicewood, TX.

TRIBUTE TO ELAINE NEKRITZ Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, earlier this month, Elaine Nekritz retired after more than 14 years of service rep-resenting the 57th District in the Illi-nois House of Representatives. Along with being a good friend and dedicated public servant, Elaine was a real leader for her constituents in Northbrook, Ar-lington Heights, Wheeling, Buffalo Grove, and across her district. Elaine’s legacy in Illinois will always be visible as people travel on high- speed rail from Chicago to St. Louis and throughout the State. As the chair of the Illinois House Railroad Industry Committee, Elaine was a leader in ad-vocating for high-speed rail before it was popular. During her service in the State House, Elaine championed women’s

rights, the environment, and criminal justice reform as well. Because of Elaine’s efforts, kids who have had run- ins with the law have a better shot at staying out of adult courts and avoid-ing getting caught in an endless crimi-nal cycle. Elaine was always willing to listen to colleagues and friends on both sides of the aisle, even when partnership was challenging. She helped craft bold leg-islation to rescue Illinois from its dire economic circumstances. As house as-sistant majority leader, she was a lead-er in working to reform pensions in our State. Fiscal responsibility was always her core value. The people of the 57th District were lucky to have such a strong advocate. Her energy, creativity, and thoughtful-ness will be missed. I thank her for her service to Illinois and her friendship. I wish her the best of luck in her next adventures and sa-lute her husband, Barry, for his strong partnership with his talented spouse.

U.S. G OVERNMENT  A
CCOUNTABILITY OFFICE , Washington, DC, October 19, 2017. Subject: Office of the Comptroller of the Cur-rency, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insur-ance Corporation—Applicability of the Congressional Review Act to Interagency Guidance on Leveraged Lending Hon. P
ATTOOMEY , U.S. Senate. D
EARSENATOR TOOMEY : You asked whether the final Interagency Guidance on Leveraged Lending (Interagency Guidance or Guid-ance), issued jointly on March 22, 2013, by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Board), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), is a rule for purposes of the Congressional Re-view Act (CRA). CRA establishes a process for congressional review of agency rules and establishes special expedited procedures under which Congress may pass a joint reso-lution of disapproval that, if enacted into law, overturns the rule. Congressional review is assisted by CRA’s requirement that all federal agencies, including independent regu-latory agencies, submit each rule to both Houses of Congress and to the Government Accountability Office (GAO) before it can take effect. For the reasons discussed below, we conclude that the Interagency Guidance is a general statement of policy and is a rule under the CRA. 
BACKGROUND  Congressional Review Act CRA, enacted in 1996 to strengthen con-gressional oversight of agency rulemaking, requires all federal agencies, including inde-pendent regulatory agencies, to submit a re-port on each new rule to both Houses of Con-gress and to the Comptroller General before it can take effect. The report must contain a copy of the rule, ‘‘a concise general state-ment relating to the rule,’’ and the rule’s proposed effective date. In addition, the agency must submit to the Comptroller Gen-eral a complete copy of the cost-benefit anal-ysis of the rule, if any, and information con-cerning the agency’s actions relevant to spe-cific procedural rulemaking requirements set forth in various statutes and executive orders governing the regulatory process. CRA adopts the definition of rule under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), which states in relevant part that a rule is ‘‘the whole or a part of an agency statement of general or particular applicability and fu-ture effect designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy or describing the organization, procedure, or practice require-ments of an agency.’’ CRA excludes three categories of rules from coverage: (1) rules of particular applicability; (2) rules relating to agency management or personnel; and (3) rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice that do not substantially affect the rights or obligations of non-agency parties. The Agencies did not send a report on the Interagency Guidance to Congress or the Comptroller General because, as they stated in their letters to our Office, in their opinion the Guidance is not a rule under the CRA. Interagency Guidance on Leveraged Lending On March 22, 2013, OCC, the Board, and FDIC (referred to collectively as the Agen-cies) issued the Interagency Guidance, which forms the basis of the Agencies’ review of the leveraged lending activities of supervised fi-nancial institutions. Leveraged lending gen-erally encompasses large loans to corporate borrowers for the purposes of ‘‘mergers and acquisitions, business recapitalization and financing, equity buyouts, and business . . . expansions.’’ Leveraged loans raise risk con-cerns because of the size of the loans relative to the borrower’s cash flow, and are gen-erally used to finance one-time business transactions rather than a company’s ordi-nary course of business activities. The Guid-ance outlines the Agencies’ minimum expec-tations on a wide range of topics related to leveraged lending, including underwriting standards, valuation standards, the risk rat-ing of leveraged loans, and problem credit management. The Interagency Guidance is ‘‘designed to assist financial institutions in providing le-veraged lending to creditworthy borrowers in a safe-and-sound manner.’’ It does so by de-scribing expectations for the sound risk management of leveraged lending activities and lists a number of considerations for fi-nancial institutions: (1) the ratio of a bor-rower’s debt to the company’s earnings be-fore interest, taxes, amortization and depre-ciation; (2) the ability of the borrower to am-ortize its secured debt, and (3) the level of due diligence performed in evaluating the loan. The Guidance explains the types of ac-tions that concern the Agencies and that might motivate them to initiate a super-visory action that would require an inde-pendent finding that an unsafe or unsound action has occurred. ANALYSIS  As an initial matter, one argument raised by the Agencies is that since the Guidance explicitly states that it is not a rule or a rulemaking action, it should not be consid-ered a rule under CRA. However, although an agency’s characterization should be consid-ered in deciding whether its action is a rule under APA (and whether, for example, it is subject to notice and comment rulemaking requirements), ‘‘an agency’s own label . . . is not dispositive.’’ Similarly, an agency’s characterization is not determinative of whether it is a rule under CRA. The focus of the arguments made by the Agencies is that the Interagency Guidance is a general statement of policy and is not sub-ject to the CRA. They assert that the Guid-ance is a statement that explains how they will exercise their broad enforcement discre-tion. They maintain that it does not estab-lish legally binding standards, is not certain or final, and does not substantially affect the rights or obligations of third parties. As a re-sult, they claim, the Interagency Guidance is not a rule under CRA. The Supreme Court has described ‘‘general statements of policy’’ as ‘‘statements issued by an agency to advise the public prospec-tively of the manner in which the agency proposes to exercise a discretionary power.’’ In other words, a statement of policy an-nounces the agency’s tentative intentions for the future: ‘‘A general statement of policy . . . does not establish a ’binding norm.’ It is not fi-nally determinative of the issues or rights to which it is addressed. The agency cannot apply or rely upon a general statement of policy as law because a general statement of policy only announces what the agency seeks to establish as policy.’’ The Interagency Guidance provides infor-mation on the manner in which the Agencies

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6637 October 19, 2017 
will exercise their enforcement authority re-garding leveraged lending activities, does not establish a ‘‘binding norm,’’ and does not determine the outcome of any Agency exam-ination of a financial institution. Rather, the Guidance expresses the regulators’ ex-pectations regarding the sound risk manage-ment of leveraged lending activities. We agree with the Agencies that the Guidance is a general statement of policy. However, the issue presented here is whether this general statement of policy is a rule under CRA. GAO has previously held that general statements of policy are rules under CRA. For example, in B–287557, May 14, 2001, we de-cided whether a ‘‘record of decision’’ (ROD) issued by the Fish and Wildlife Service in connection with a federal irrigation project was a rule under CRA. We found that the ROD was a general statement of policy re-garding water flow and ecosystems issues in both the Trinity and Sacramento Rivers. The ROD modified prior policy in an at-tempt, in part, to restore fish habitat. We cited to the APA definition of ‘‘rule,’’ which includes ‘‘the whole or a part of an agency statement of general or particular applicability and future effect designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy or describing the organization, proce-dure, or practice requirements of an agen-cy.’’ This definition includes three key com-ponents: (1) an agency statement, (2) of fu-ture effect, and (3) designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy. We stat-ed that this definition is broad, and includes both rules requiring notice and comment rulemaking and those that do not, such as general statements of policy. We noted that, since CRA adopts the defi-nition of ‘‘rule’’ from APA, it too covers both those requiring notice and comment and general statements of policy, which do not. We decided that the ROD fell squarely within CRA as an agency action that con-stituted a ‘‘statement of general . . . appli-cability and future effect designed to imple-ment, interpret or prescribe law or policy.’’ We also noted that Congress intended CRA to cover, not only formal rulemaking, but also rules requiring notice and comment under 5 U.S.C. 553(c), rules that are not sub-ject to notice and comment requirements, including rules that must be published in the Federal Register before taking effect (5 U S C. 552(a)(1) and (2)), and other guidance docu-ments. Since a general statement of policy is specifically included among the types of agency actions subject to the requirements of Sections 552(a)(1) (D) and (a)(2)(B), it is clear that CRA covers general statements of policy. Additionally, in B–316048, April 17, 2008, we considered whether a letter issued by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to state health officials concerning the State Children’s Health Insurance Pro-gram (SCHIP) was a rule under CRA. We con-cluded that the letter was subject to CRA be-cause it was, in fact, a rule subject to notice and comment rulemaking requirements. However, in that decision we also discussed general statements of policy under CRA. CMS had argued that the letter was a gen-eral statement of policy ‘‘announcing the course which the agency intends to follow’’ in future adjudications, i.e., what the agency seeks to establish as policy. We explained that the definition of ‘‘rule’’ under both APA and CRA includes ‘‘a statement of general or particular applicability and future effect de-signed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy.’’ As a device that provides in-formation on the manner in which an agency will exercise its authority or what the agen-cy will seek to propose as policy, we noted that a general statement of policy would ap-pear to fit squarely within this definition of a rule subject to CRA. In deciding that a general statement of policy is a rule for CRA purposes, our prior decisions cite to the legislative history of CRA, which confirms that rules subject to CRA requirements include general state-ments of policy. A principal sponsor of the legislation that became CRA made clear that general statements of policy are covered by CRA, stating that ‘‘[t]he committees intend [CRA] to be interpreted broadly with regard to the type and scope of rules that are sub-ject to congressional review.’’ The sponsor added that documents covered by CRA in-clude ‘‘statements of general policy, inter-pretations of general applicability, and ad-ministrative staff manuals and instructions to staff that affect a member of the public.’’ Additionally, in a floor statement during final consideration of the bill that became CRA, another principal sponsor of the legis-lation pointed out that rules subject to CRA include agency general statements of policy. ‘‘Although agency interpretive rules, gen-eral statements of policy, guideline docu-ments, and agency policy and procedure manuals may not be subject to the notice and comment provisions of section 553(c) of title 5, United States Code, these types of documents are covered under the congres-sional review provisions of the new chapter 8 of title 5. ‘‘Under section 801(a) [CRA], covered rules, with very few exceptions, may not go into ef-fect until the relevant agency submits a copy of the rule and an accompanying report to both Houses of Congress. Interpretive rules, general statements of policy, and anal-ogous agency policy guidelines are covered without qualification because they meet the definition of a ’rule’ borrowed from section 551 of title 5, and are not excluded from the definition of a rule.’’ We note that legal commentators also sup-port the conclusion that CRA’s requirements are applicable to general statements of pol-icy. They have pointed out that federal agen-cy actions fitting CRA’s definition of a rule include ‘‘such items as . . . general state-ments of policy,’’ and that ‘‘the legislative history of the Act . . . makes clear that this scope was understood and intended.’’ Nonetheless, the Agencies assert that be-cause the Guidance does not establish legally binding standards, is not certain or final, and does not substantially affect the rights or obligations of third parties, it is not a rule under CRA. They cite to our decisions in which we found that agency actions that im-posed binding requirements that were ‘‘both certain and final’’ were rules for CRA pur-poses. However, while our decisions recog-nize those characteristics as indicative of certain types of rules subject to CRA re-quirements, they do not suggest that the ab-sence of those characteristics requires a de-termination that an agency action is not a rule under CRA. Moreover, when GAO has ex-amined the issue whether an agency’s action substantially affects the rights or obliga-tions of third parties, it has been in the con-text of analyzing whether the action falls within the CRA exception for agency rules of practice or procedure, not in deciding wheth-er it meets the definition of rule. The Agencies also cite to language in cer-tain court decisions to suggest that policy statements are not rules under APA. How-ever, those decisions do not support such a conclusion. Indeed, the Supreme Court has recognized that rules under the APA include ‘‘’substantive [legislative] rules’ on the one hand’’ as well as ‘‘general statements of pol-icy’’ and other non-legislative rules on the other. We can readily conclude that the Guidance does not fall within any of the three excep-tions in CRA. We note here that the Inter-agency Guidance is of general and not par-ticular applicability, does not relate to agen-cy management or personnel, and is not a rule of agency organization, procedure, or practice. 
CONCLUSION  The Interagency Guidance is a general statement of policy designed to assist finan-cial institutions in providing leveraged lend-ing to creditworthy borrowers in a sound manner. As such, it is a rule subject to the requirements of CRA. Sincerely yours, S
USAN A. P OLING , General Counsel. f 
CHRISTENING OF THE USNS ‘‘HERSHEL ‘WOODY’ WILLIAMS’’ Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, today I wish to celebrate the christening of the United States Navy’s T-ESB 4 Expedi-tionary Sea Base, USNS Hershel ‘‘Woody’’ Williams taking place on Octo-ber 21, 2017. This vessel is named after the proud West Virginian and last sur-viving Medal of Honor recipient from the Pacific theater during World War II. This ship will serve as a flexible platform to support Special Forces hel-icopters and aircraft, as well as counterpiracy and mine counter-measures. This ship could not have a better namesake than Woody Williams. Woody’s life is the embodiment of what it means to serve this country, both in his military service during World War II, and his service to veterans and Gold Star families in his civilian life. Cor-poral Williams’ actions on Iwo Jima are the definition of heroism. He went forward alone, facing deadly machine-gun fire from entrenched Japanese po-sitions and fought bravely for 4 hours, taking out enemy positions one by one. His actions were crucial to his regi-ment’s success on Iwo Jima, wiping out a heavily defended Japanese position. In addition to Woody’s wartime her-oism, for which he received the Con-gressional Medal of Honor, he also has devoted his life to servicemembers, veterans, and their families. Through the Hershel Woody Williams Medal of Honor Foundation, he honors Gold Star families who have lost loved ones that bravely sacrificed their lives in defense of our freedom by seeking to establish Gold Star Families Memorial Monu-ments in all 50 States. His foundation also offers scholarships to Gold Star children and sponsors outreach pro-grams that educate communities about Gold Star families and the sacrifice that they have made. To date, the foundation has established 26 Gold Star Families Memorial Monuments across the country, with 50 other monuments underway in 38 States. Woody also served our Nation’s veterans for 33 years as a veterans service representa-tive in the Department of Veterans Af-fairs. At 94 years old, Woody continues to be an energetic, unyielding force for good. I have had the privilege of know-ing Woody Williams for many years, and the christening of this mobile sea base vessel is a testament to Woody’s

200TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE BIRTH OF BAHA’U’LLAH, THE FOUNDER OF THE BAHA’I FAITH Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I am very pleased to draw attention today to the 200th anniversary of the birth of Baha’u’llah, the founder of the Baha’i Faith. The Baha’i Faith has over 5 million followers around the world, including over 2,000 in Tennessee. Baha’is come from virtually every racial, ethnic, na-tional, tribal, and linguistic back-ground on the planet. On October 22, 2017, Baha’i commu-nities across the United States and around the world will commemorate the 200th anniversary of the birth of Baha’u’llah—the founder of the Baha’i Faith—and celebrate his life and his teachings. Baha’u’llah was born to a noble fam-ily in 1817 in Persia, modern-day Iran. As a young man, he was known for his charity and service to others and was called the father of the poor. In 1844, he founded the Baha’i Faith, a new and independent religion with its own scriptures, laws, teachings, and prac-tices. Baha’u’llah proclaimed a message of justice, unity, and peace. This message called for, among other things, the equality of women and men, an end to racial prejudice, universal education, interfaith harmony, and international cooperation. As a result of his teach-ings, Baha’u’llah was imprisoned and exiled for over 40 years by the Persian and Ottoman empires. Despite the injustice and oppression he faced throughout his life, Baha’u’llah continued to promote a message of peace and unity based upon harmony within the human race. In every place to which he was banished, he touched the lives of all those around him. Even some of his opponents, after meeting him, became his friends and admirers. Today Baha’is in Iran are still per-secuted for their faith, and human rights experts have called their situa-tion one of the clearest and most se-vere cases of religious persecution in the world. The Baha’i Faith first arrived in the U.S. over 120 years ago. Baha’is now live in every State of the Union, in-cluding Tennessee, where the commu-nity has grown to over 2,000 members. Wherever they live, Baha’is cham-pion the principles that Baha’u’llah proclaimed. They strive to build a bet-ter world by being good citizens, serv-ing their communities, and working side by side with others to promote the common good. On this important occasion, I con-gratulate the Baha’i community of Tennessee and across the United States on the bicentennial of the birth of Baha’u’llah. f 
REMEMBERING EVELYNE J. VILLINES Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the passing of disability rights pioneer and my long-time friend, Ms. Evelyne Villines. Ever since I first met Evelyne during my early years in the Iowa House of Rep-resentatives, I knew her to be a fierce advocate on behalf of those with dis-abilities. She had an outstanding work ethic and never stopped campaigning for those with disabilities to be recog-nized for their abilities and not by what others saw as their limitations. Thanks to people like Evelyne, our society has made a lot of progress in this area. Evelyne’s tireless work earned her recognition on both the State and national levels as an in-ductee into the Iowa Women’s Hall of Fame and the national Hall of Fame for Persons with Disabilities. Evelyne’s efforts were recognized as paving the way for passage for the American with Disabilities Act of 1990. She served on numerous commissions and joined the board of SourceAmerica in its infancy, leading the company to become one of the largest employers of people with disabilities in the Nation. Evelyne’s advocacy and resulting ac-complishments have opened the doors of opportunity for people with disabil-ities. 
I am honored to stand before you in recog-nizing Evelyne for her lifelong commitment to service. Evelyne’s legacy will live on for years to come through the countless individ-uals who will continue to benefit from her life’s work. f 
TRIBUTE TO ROBERT HIGDON, JR. Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Robert Higdon, Jr., and congratulate him on his appoint-ment as the U.S. Attorney for the East-ern District of North Carolina. Bobby earned both his law degree and undergraduate degree from Wake For-est University and has a decorated ca-reer in public service and in private practice. Prior to law school, he worked for then-Secretary of Transpor-tation Elizabeth Dole and for Senator John East. Upon graduating from law school, Bobby served as a law clerk to Judge Eugene H. Phillips on the North Carolina Court of Appeals. After work-ing for several years in private prac-tice, he began a successful career as a Federal prosecutor. From 1991 until 2015, Bobby served in the U.S. Attorney’s Office and the U.S. Department of Justice in a number of roles, including chief of the criminal division in the Eastern District of North Carolina. He has vast experience investigating, prosecuting, and advis-ing on criminal cases, ranging from violent crime and drug trafficking to white collar and public integrity crimes. Aside from his sterling legal career, Bobby is an active member of his com-munity, inspiring and helping others. He serves his church as a volunteer and a Sunday School teacher, and he has mentored the next generation of law-yers by coaching in various mock trial competitions. His example reminds us that our roles as public servants extend beyond the office. It was an honor to recommend Bobby Higdon to President Trump. Anyone who works with him knows he is a dedicated professional who has exten-sive legal knowledge and expertise. In addition, he is widely respected in the law enforcement community, and these relationships will be incredibly valu-able as he takes on this important role. Bobby understands the challenges and issues facing North Carolina, and I know that he will continue to lead the U.S. Attorney’s Office with dignity and respect. f 
ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO NORMAN JOSEPH ∑Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to commend Norman Joseph of Jackson, a leader in Mississippi ath-letics, on his induction into the Belhaven University Sports Hall of Fame this month. Coach Joseph is a Vicksburg native who played quarter-back and defensive back at Mississippi State University. As a coach in the nearly four decades since, he has deliv-ered a tradition of excellence, success, and Christian character to student-ath-letes in Mississippi and across the country. Norman Joseph has coached on every level of 4-year college football. Start-ing and rebuilding teams became a hallmark of his career. He built the Belhaven University football program from the ground up and served as its inaugural head coach. Coach Joseph launched Belhaven’s recruiting pro-gram, designed its uniforms, and con-sulted on the creation of practice fa-cilities and a new athletic complex. Under his leadership, the football pro-gram experienced immediate success and achieved a Top 25 ranking for 6 consecutive weeks during its second season. Coach Joseph has coached at three Jackson-area colleges. In addition to Belhaven, he served as quarterbacks coach at Millsaps College and head coach at Mississippi College in Clinton for nine seasons. At Mississippi College, Coach Joseph took a program in decline and estab-lished a winning culture. Under his guidance, the team had an eight-win season in only 3 years. Within 5 years, the team won the conference cham-pionship and went to the second round of the Division III playoffs. Coach Jo-seph took his team to NCAA Top 25 Na-tional Rankings in scoring offense, total offense, passing offense, rushing

offense, first downs, and fewest inter-ceptions. In 2009, he coached Mis-sissippi College to the American Southwest Conference cochampions and was named the 2009 American Football Coaches Association Regional Coach of the Year and the 2009 Amer-ican Southwest Conference Coach of the Year. Coach Joseph began his coaching ca-reer at the University of Louisiana at Monroe as a position coach working for John David Crow, who was Bear Bry-ant’s only Heisman Trophy winner. He later returned to Louisiana Monroe as offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach, delivering record offense, four consecutive winning seasons, and three NCAA Division 1AA championship berths ranked at number four or high-er. He took over the Louisiana College football program 3 years after that pro-gram was reinstated and compiled the school’s best record in more than 40 years. He has also assisted programs at the University of Southern Mississippi, San Jose State University, Vanderbilt University, Louisiana Tech University, Northwestern State University, and Midwestern State University. Coach Joseph has set offensive records at every school he has coached, including an NCAA Division I record for combined total yards in a game, a record set in 2001 that remained intact until last year. Coach Joseph’s career has been fo-cused on more than gridiron wins and records. As a coach, his attention to the development of players as individ-uals has resulted in academic and pro-fessional success for many young men. Under his guidance, scores of players have earned Academic All-Conference, All-American, All-Conference, and MVP honors. He has the distinction of coaching three quarterbacks with Super Bowl rings, and one of his former players is currently the head football coach of the Philadelphia Eagles. Coach Joseph has been active in the Fellowship of Christian Athletes. In 2016, he was appointed by Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant to the Gov-ernor’s Commission on Physical Fit-ness and Sports. I am proud to recognize Norman Jo-seph as an outstanding Mississippian. He and his wife, the former Jane Bird of Vicksburg, have three daughters, Elizabeth, Grace Anne, and Sara Cath-erine. Elizabeth serves on my staff. This family is active at First Baptist Church in Jackson where Coach Joseph serves as a deacon. Belhaven University’s long tradition of producing successful student-ath-letes could not be accomplished with-out outstanding leadership from coach-es and staff. I know Norman Joseph provided that leadership and character, and I am pleased he will be honored as a member of the Belhaven University Sports Hall of Fame.∑ TRIBUTE TO TODD DUNLAP ∑Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Todd Dunlap from East Helena, MT. Todd served in the U.S. Navy for 24 years as an electronic warfare and cryptology specialist, ulti-mately attaining the rank of master chief petty officer, the highest enlisted rank in the Navy. Todd’s service in-cluded seven deployments overseas in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and other efforts. His work supported Special Operations Forces on the ground. Todd’s service did not end when he left Active Duty. He now works for the Montana Department of Veterans Af-fairs and continues to support those who have also served our country. His peers view him as a highly skilled pro-fessional and subject matter expert, and he has earned a reputation for self-less outreach across the State to assist veterans and their family members navigate the VA. As someone who continues to serve members of the Armed Forces commu-nity, Todd is receiving a gift from a Montana organization that donates a fully outfitted trip to military service-members who have provided extraor-dinary service to our country and to those facing life-threatening illness. I sincerely thank Todd for his continued service to our great Nation. He is well- deserving of this recognition. As an avid outdoorsman myself, I hope he tags a wonderful elk during his time away with family.∑ 
TRIBUTE TO CHRIS HINDOIEN  
∑Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, this week, I have the distinct honor of rec-ognizing an exceptional volunteer named Chris Hindoien. Chris has helped inform and educate Montanans serving in the National Guard or Reserve com-ponent, as well as their employers, about the rights and responsibilities associated with a military mobiliza-tion. In August, Chris was recognized by the Office of the Secretary of Defense for nearly 4 years of service as the State chairman of the Montana Em-ployer Support of the Guard and Re-serve, ESGR. For his efforts, Chris re-ceived the Exceptional Public Service Award. During his stretch as chairman, he worked tirelessly to make sure that the relationship between military serv-icemembers and their employers re-mained strong across Big Sky Country. Chris is the son of the late Brig. Gen. Gary Hindoien, a former commander of the Montana Air National Guard, so his demonstrated commitment to our State and our Nation comes as no sur-prise. Montana has a longstanding tradi-tion of public service. Whether it be working on an agriculture project as a Peace Corps volunteer or as an Army Ranger at the tip of the military spear, the Montana attitude towards service to others continues to endure and Chris’s work has enabled others to serve. Thank you, Chris, for commit-ting your time and talent to enable the success of others.∑ f

This legislation expands the boundary of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area to provide sur-rounding communities much-needed additional access to nature while main-taining private property rights and ex-isting local land use authorities. This bill adds an additional 191,000 acres, known as the Rim of the Valley Unit, to better protect natural re-sources and habitats, and provide mem-bers of the local community with im-proved recreational and educational opportunities. This proposed expansion comes at the recommendation of the National Park Service after a six-year special re-source study of the area. The study was directed by Congress in the Rim of the Valley Corridor Study Act, passed in 2008. The National Park Service’s rec-ommendation takes into account over 2,000 comments received from the pub-lic, elected officials, local organiza-tions, and other stakeholders.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES6646 October 19, 2017 
This legislation will significantly ex-pand outdoor recreational opportuni-ties for residents of Los Angeles Coun-ty, one of the most densely populated and park-poor areas in California. In fact, 47% of Californians—that’s six percent of the U.S. population—live within two hours of the proposed ex-pansion area. Enlarging the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area will provide these communities with increased access to public lands and a boost to the local economy. The proposed expansion will also pro-tect valuable habitat for endangered wildlife, such as the California red- legged frog. Other species protected in-clude mountain lions, bobcats, foxes, badgers, coyotes, and deer. Notably, the Rim of the Valley Cor-ridor Preservation Act would only allow the Department of the Interior to acquire non-Federal land within the new boundaries through exchange, do-nation, or purchase from willing sell-ers. This legislation will not create any additional liability or restrictions for private property owners. This bill enjoys the support of more than 50 local municipalities, commu-nity groups, and elected officials. It is the product of true public engagement in the legislative process. I would like to thank my colleague, Representative A
DAM SCHIFF , for intro-ducing this legislation in the House. I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass the Rim of the Val-ley Corridor Preservation Act. Thank you, Mr. President, I yield the floor.

S. R ES. 296 Whereas carbon monoxide is an odorless, colorless gas that is produced whenever any fuel, such as natural gas, propane, gasoline, oil, kerosene, wood, or charcoal, is burned; Whereas devices that produce carbon mon-oxide include cars, boats, portable power generators, gasoline engines, stoves, and heating systems, and carbon monoxide pro-duced from these sources can build up in en-closed or semi-enclosed spaces; Whereas carbon monoxide is often referred to as the ‘‘silent killer’’ because it is color-less, odorless, tasteless, and non-irritating, and ignoring early stages of carbon mon-oxide poisoning may cause unconsciousness and continual exposure to danger; Whereas according to the Centers for Dis-ease Control and Prevention, each year in the United States, carbon monoxide poi-soning kills more than 150 individuals and sends approximately 20,000 individuals to emergency rooms; Whereas when people breathe in carbon monoxide, the poisonous gas enters the bloodstream and prevents adequate intake of oxygen, which can damage tissues and result in death; Whereas, given their common preexisting medical conditions, individuals older than age 65 are particularly vulnerable to carbon monoxide poisoning; Whereas for most individuals who suffer from carbon monoxide poisoning, the early signs of exposure to low concentrations of carbon monoxide include mild headaches and breathlessness upon moderate exercise; Whereas sustained or increased exposure to carbon monoxide can lead to flu-like symp-toms, including severe headaches, dizziness, tiredness, nausea, confusion, irritability, and impaired judgment, memory, and coordina-tion; Whereas breathing in low concentrations of carbon monoxide can cause long-term health damage, even after exposure to the gas ends; Whereas most cases of carbon monoxide ex-posure occur during the colder months of De-cember, January, and February, when oil and gas heaters are more heavily in use; Whereas on January 5, 1996, the Burt fam-ily of Kimball, Minnesota, was poisoned by carbon monoxide from a malfunctioning fur-nace in the home of the Burt family, result-ing in— (1) the deaths of 15-month-old Zachary Todd Burt and 4-year-old Nicholas Todd Burt; and (2) the hospitalization of Ryan Todd Burt;

Whereas Cheryl Burt, the mother of Zachary, Nicholas, and Ryan Burt, has worked to educate the public about the dan-gers of carbon monoxide poisoning, including by testifying in December 2009 before the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate; Whereas according to the North Dakota Department of Health, among residents over the age of 65, carbon monoxide poisoning was the leading substance-related cause of death in North Dakota from 2009 to 2014; Whereas the North Dakota Department of Health found that, in 2010, carbon monoxide poisoning was the second-leading cause of unintentional poisoning death among adults ages 30 through 49; Whereas on June 7, 2015, 3 adults and 1 child in Blanchard, North Dakota, tragically passed away from carbon monoxide poi-soning as the result of a carbon monoxide leak caused by an improperly vented water heater; and Whereas increasing awareness about the dangers of carbon monoxide can help prevent poisoning and save lives: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Senate designates the week of November 5 through 12, 2017, as ‘‘Na-tional Carbon Monoxide Poisoning Aware-ness Week’’. f

HONORING PETER D. TRUMAN 
HON. DWIGHT EVANS 
OF PENNSYLVANIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 19, 2017 Mr. EVANS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a dedicated and accomplished man from our City, former Pennsylvania State Rep-resentative, Peter D. Truman. Peter was born in the City of Philadelphia on January 13, 1935. He received his Bach-elor of Business Administration from Florida State Christian College and attended New York State University. From 1959 to 1967, he served as an officer on the Philadelphia Police Department and in 1968, he served as a con-stable to the 3rd Ward of Philadelphia. After, he worked as assistant to the chief clerk in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives (1968 to 1971). From 1970 to 1982, he served as president of the 3rd Ward Committeeman As-sociation. From 1971 to 1972, he was the di-rector of the Pennsylvania Bureau of General Services. From 1972 to 1973, he worked as the regional director to the Pennsylvania De-partment of Commerce and was an adminis-trative assistant to the Sheriff of Philadelphia (1973 to 1975). Further, Peter served as director of the Pennsylvania Bureau of General Services (1971 to 1972) and regional director of the Pennsylvania Department of Commerce (1972 to 1973). After, he was an administrative as-sistant to the Sheriff of Philadelphia (1973 to 1975) and deputy chief clerk to the Philadel-phia Traffic Court (1979 to 1982). Additionally, he was a leader of the 3rd Ward Democratic Committee (1982). Admirably, he was elected as a Democrat to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives for the 1983, 1985 and 1987 terms. He resigned from the House, January 4, 1988. He also served as Clerk of Quarter Sessions for the City of Philadelphia (1988 to 1992). In addition to his diverse career of pub-lic service, Peter is the founder of Dan-Silo Consultants. The 2nd Congressional District of Pennsyl-vania extends gratitude to Peter Truman for his dedicated support to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

RECOGNIZING THE VILLAGE WEST POOL 50TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 19, 2017 Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to rec-ognize the Village West Pool on the occasion of its 50th anniversary. This historic milestone is a testament to the strength of community spirit in Fairfax County and throughout North-ern Virginia. The neighborhood of West Springfield was developed in 1966 by the Richmarr Construc-tion Company. Richmarr generously donated land on which to build a community pool how-ever, financing the construction of the pool itself was left to the community. Determined to take advantage of the opportunity to improve their neighborhood, the citizens of West Springfield came together to raise the nec-essary funds and one year later, on July 4, 1967, the Village West Pool opened. Since that time, generations of residents have enjoyed facility. Three levels of swim-ming programs are offered including the Vi-kings for swimmers aged 4 to 18. This is a competitive swim team and is part of the Northern Virginia Swim League, the largest summer swim league in the nation. The Little Vikings is the developmental team and also swims in certain meets, including the Lollipop Meet. There is also a Learn to Swim program for very young swimmers who are not yet comfortable in the water. To encourage com-munity spirit and camaraderie, The Pavilion is available to rent for local parties and gath-erings. In addition, pool membership fees are discounted to all who agree to volunteer dur-ing the pool season. Mr. Speaker, the health of a community can be judged through its level of civic engage-ment. The creation of the Village West Pool and its innovative programs are a testament to the level of civic engagement that is present in West Springfield and in fact, throughout Fair-fax County. A group of citizens decided that they wanted to do something to make their community better and they set about doing just that. This willingness to work together to achieve a common goal speaks volumes on the health of our communities. Fairfax County remains one of the best places in the country in which to live, work and raise a family due to the efforts of individuals like the ones that came together to create the Village West Pool and the current residents and members who are committed to maintaining and preserving this neighborhood asset. I commend the Pool’s Board and the entire West Springfield Civic Association for reaching this historic milestone and ask my colleagues to join me in wishing them great success in their future en-deavors. f 
ADDITIONAL SUPPLEMENTAL AP-PROPRIATIONS FOR DISASTER RELIEF REQUIREMENTS ACT, 2017 
SPEECH OF  
HON. RICHARD E. NEAL 
OF MASSACHUSETTS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 12, 2017 Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the disaster supplement because it provides critical funds to help rebuild communities in the U.S. states and territories, including Puerto Rico. Although I support this bill, I am con-cerned it is not enough. For example, it fails to provide funds for Community Development Block Grants, critical health care needs, Social Services Block Grants and public housing as-sistance. I am proud to represent one of the largest Puerto Rican communities in the United States. Since the hurricane, I have worked closely with federal and state authorities to en-sure help is delivered to the island in an effi-cient manner. In addition, I have worked closely with Puerto Rican communities in my Congressional district to answer questions and help them reconnect with friends and family. We need to assure people in these devastated areas Congress will stand with them in the short and long term—provide comfort and im-mediate needs now and also funds to rebuild infrastructure and restore and strengthen their economy that will sustain well into the future. As these funds are dispersed, it is impera-tive they are managed responsibly so storm victims don’t become targets of shady out-siders or crooked business owners. This week, President Trump once again let down the people of Puerto Rico by announc-ing he plans to prematurely pull the military, FEMA and other critical agency support from the island. This approach is irresponsible and dangerous. The island and its people are still fragile and need to rebuild, not be burdened with further anxiety and uncertainty. f 
HONORING ALPHONSO ‘‘AL’’ DEAL 
HON. DWIGHT EVANS 
OF PENNSYLVANIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 19, 2017 Mr. EVANS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a dedicated and courageous man from North Philadelphia, Alphonso ‘‘Al’’ Deal, a re-tired Philadelphia Police Officer and former Philadelphia State Representative. Al was born in Watertown, Florida. From 1941 to 1945, he served in the U.S. Army for four years as a Military Policeman, where he actively led protests against segregation. As an honorable discharge, he settled in Philadel-phia and secured employment at the Edward G. Budd Company. While there, he was ap-pointed chairman of the union’s first Fair Em-ployment Anti-discrimination Committee and Chairman of the Education Committee. In 1954, Al became a Philadelphia Police Officer where he dedicated his career and life to improving the lives of others. Specifically, he aimed to end unfair police tactics and bru-tality. To do so, he organized the Guardian Civic League to better relations and under-standing between the police and community. Under his leadership the Guardian Civic spon-sored various programs such as food baskets for the needy during Christmas and Thanks-giving, sending underprivileged children to Summer Camp, serving as chaperones to teenage programs, supporting revised Fair Housing Legislation and cooperating with other Civic groups to further their efforts in general service to the community. Further, Al served as the first Black man to be assigned to the Labor Squad.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD —Extensions of RemarksE1388 October 19, 2017 
In 1969, Al took a leave of absence train and raised $52,000 for the Fayette, Mississippi Police Department. The funds raised provided the Fayette Police Department with a much needed police car. Upon his return, in 1980, he was elected to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives and served from 1981 to 1987. Al dedicated his life to improving the lives of African Americans and was an active member of the NAACP since 1948. He served on var-ious committees, became vice-president, and finally President of the North Philadelphia ‘‘Ac-tion’’ branch. Approximately 200 awards from the National, State, and Community NAACP Branches have been presented to either Al in-dividually or to the North Philadelphia ‘‘Action’’ Branch for outstanding achievement. Likewise, the National Black Police Association created a scholarship in honor of Al Deal. In addition to receiving numerous awards and honors, Al served on the Board of Trustees at Temple University. Although Al faced adversity, it served as a stepping stone to carry on his work of improv-ing the lives of others. The 2nd Congressional District of Pennsylvania extends gratitude to Al ‘‘The People’s Champion’’ for his dedicated support to the Commonwealth of Pennsyl-vania.

CELEBRATING THE MILITARY SERVICE OF CAPTAIN KELLIE BYERLY, (RET.) 
HON. BRIAN BABIN 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 19, 2017 Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank a great man for his military service, Captain Kellie S. Byerly, USN (Ret). Captain Byerly was born in Danville, Illinois on October 19, 1939. He began his prestigious twenty- seven-year Naval career in Long Beach, Cali-fornia. Captain Byerly served in numerous mana-gerial positions on the USS John Paul Jones (DDG–32) and as Chief Engineer of the USS Decatur (DDG–31). Captain Bylery later worked as a Professor of Naval Science at the State University of New York Maritime Col-lege. Captain Byerly held commands as: Ex-ecutive Officer of the guided missile destroy-ers USS Hoel (DDG–13) and USS Robinson (DDG–12). He later served as Commodore of Task Force Sixty-Three in Naples, Italy. Cap-tain Byerly concluded his Naval career as Senior Inspector for the Propulsion Examina-tion Board in San Diego, California. Following his retirement from the United States Navy, Captain Byerly worked super-vising operations in power plants around the world. He was hired by Stewart and Steven-son, an independent power company based in Houston as Vice President of Operations for the company’s western region. He later served with General Electric as Vice President of Central American and Western United States regions. Captain Byerly concluded his career with the Calpine Corporation, as Vice Presi-dent of Operations for the company’s Central Region. Captain Byerly is married to Deborah L. Byerly who he met in Bremerton, Washington while his ship, the USS Robinson (DDG–12) was undergoing an overhaul. After retiring from the Navy, Captain and Mrs. Byerly be-came residents of Nassau Bay, Texas in 1991 and have enjoyed being part of the community ever since. Mrs. Byerly has worked for the NASA Johnson Space Center for over twenty years. Mr. Speaker, I rise to thank Captain Kellie Byerly for his many years of selfless service to our great nation in the United States Navy. f 
RECOGNIZING THE VIENNA HOST LIONS CLUB 75TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 19, 2017 Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an important member of our local civil society. The Vienna Host Lions Club, based in the Town of Vienna in Fairfax Coun-ty, Virginia, is observing its 75th anniversary this year. Originally chartered on May 7, 1942 as the Arlington Host Lions Club, the Vienna Host Lions Club has spent three-quarters of a century working to improve the community around them. Indeed, it currently holds the dis-tinction of being the oldest community service organization in Vienna. The Club’s philanthropic efforts began in the heart of wartime, raising funds to support Al-lied service members overseas during World War II. The club also took action on the home front, constructing and operating a watchtower to scan for enemy aircraft. At the conclusion of the war, the club collected clothing to send to Europe to aid in reconstruction efforts. In 1965, the Vienna Host Lions Club left a per-manent mark on the Town of Vienna by rais-ing funds to build the new Vienna Community Center. Since that time, it has made other sig-nificant contributions to the betterment of the Town of Vienna through advocating for the in-stallation of lights on the athletic fields of James Madison High School and other com-munity ballparks, and the construction of a two-story press box at Walters Field. In addition, the Club sponsors the James A. Bland Music Scholarship, and donates funds to many local organizations including those that address the needs of people with sight or hearing impairments, youth activities, and so-cial welfare programs, as well as American Legion Post 180. Mr. Speaker, volunteerism and public serv-ice are two of the highest callings, and the Vi-enna Host Lions Club is an example that other civic groups would do well to emulate. The health of a community can be judged through its level of civic engagement. The fact that the Vienna Host Lions Club has endured for such a protracted period of time speaks volumes to the health of not only the Town of Vienna, but the Northern Virginia region as a whole. The Town of Vienna has been named one of the best places in which to live for a number of years, a distinction that is largely due to the efforts of individuals like the members, past and present, of Vienna Host Lions Club. I commend the entire organization for reaching this historic milestone and ask my colleagues to join me in thanking the Club, its officers and members, and all who support it for their serv-ice to our community. HONORING ALEXANDRA ‘‘SANDY’’ BRESLIN HON. ELIZABETH H. ESTY 
OF CONNECTICUT  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 19, 2017 Ms. ESTY of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Sandy Breslin, who passed away on May 31, 2017. Sandy was a longtime environmental and civic activist in Connecticut, and her work to protect the Long Island Sound and to conserve our state’s natural wonders will benefit future generations. A native of New Haven, Connecticut, Sandy was an exceptional leader in Connecticut’s en-vironmental community for decades, and worked with a number of organizations to achieve conservation goals and stronger envi-ronmental laws. A trailblazing activist for the protection and restoration of Long Island Sound, Sandy’s work helped secure passage of the Long Island Sound Stewardship Act as well as tens of millions of dollars in federal conservation funding. Sandy also worked with groups including the Connecticut Land Conservation Council and the Connecticut Fund for the Environment to improve the state’s wildlife protections, pre-serve more than 18,000 acres of land, and strengthen Connecticut’s Environmental Policy Act. Her activism and achievements drew na-tional recognition, and Sandy was awarded the Department of the Interior’s Environmental Achievement Award, a Teaming with Wildlife Member Achievement Award, and a Coastal America Award. Sandy was committed to public service in Connecticut, and leaders of both political par-ties held her opinion and work in high regard. In addition to her environmental policy work, she was active in local Democratic politics and served as the Chairwoman of the Bethany Democratic Town Committee for many years. She cherished working with young environ-mental activists and public servants, and lead-ers across our state have benefitted from her guidance and wisdom. I count myself lucky to have known Sandy as a friend as well as an environmental leader. She was a great woman with knowledge, heart, and a big warm laugh. Mr. Speaker, Sandy Breslin spent her life working to protect our environment and im-prove our world. Therefore, it is fitting and proper that we honor her here today, and I ex-tend my deepest condolences to her wonder-ful mother and to all who knew and loved Sandy. Sandy, we will miss you.

HONORING THE LUFKIN LITTLE LEAGUE ALL-STARS, THE 2017 LITTLE LEAGUE WORLD SERIES U.S. NATIONAL CHAMPIONS 
HON. LOUIE GOHMERT 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 19, 2017 Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, a different va-riety of thunder rolled across Williamsport, Pennsylvania in late August, which provided some respite from the devastating storms which were battering Texas . . . the ‘‘Thun-dering 13’’ from Angelina County, Texas cap-tured the attention of millions and the title of a lifetime when they emerged victorious as the U.S. National Champions in the 2017 Little League World Series tournament. The Lufkin All-Stars gained its distinctive nickname of ‘‘Thundering 13’’ during grueling two-a-day practices and games leading up to the tournament, when the young men pounded so many home runs that spectators said it sounded like thunder. A single loss during the national tournament motivated the team even further, resulting in a rematch where they ultimately emerged vic-torious against the only team that challenged their bid for the national title. With the strength of their camaraderie unit-ing them, and the unwavering support of their family, friends, and fans, this talented, reso-lute, and relentless national championship team never lost sight of the dream. This remarkable accomplishment cannot be possible without the determination and hard work of every team member, along with the skill and experience of dedicated Head Coach and Manager Bud Maddux, along with Assist-ant Coaches Malcolm Deason and Ryan Deaton. My most enthusiastic praise and congratula-tions goes to national champions Chip Buchanan, Malcolm Deason, Jr., Charlie Deaton, Hunter Ditsworth, Kolby Kovar, Lance Modisette, Christian Mumphery, Zach Phipps, Mark Requena, Collin Ross, Chandler Spen-cer, Blake Slaga, and Clayton Wigley. The path to a championship title can be long and arduous, but the Lufkin All-Stars met the challenge sustained by the solid and en-thusiastic encouragement of a fiercely loyal network of community support which provided the foundation upon which a national cham-pionship emerged. These young men bear witness to the fact that anything is achievable though focus, hard work and determination. These are guiding life principles that lead to success not only on the field, but will undoubtedly resonate through every endeavor these valiant championship players undertake in their entire lifetimes. May God continue to bless these young people, along with their families, friends and neighbors in east Texas and beyond. It is an extraordinary privilege to recognize the Lufkin All-Stars, 2017 Little League World Series U.S. National Champions. f 
RECOGNIZING THE GRADUATES OF THE FAIRFAX COUNTY FIRE AND RESCUE DEPARTMENT HIGH SCHOOL FIREFIGHTER PROGRAM 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 19, 2017 Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 2017 graduating class of the Fairfax County High School Firefighter Pro-gram. Last year, the Fairfax County Fire and Rescue Department in partnership with Fairfax County Public Schools created its High School Firefighter Program to provide training to stu-dents who are considering a career as a fire-fighter. Students who participate in this program at-tend courses taught by qualified instructors at the Fairfax County Fire Academy. In fact, they receive some of the same training as new pro-fessional and volunteer firefighters. The course is grueling but upon successful com-pletion, the students will receive six college credits. Should these students decide to apply to the Fairfax County Fire Academy, success-ful completion of this program will make them very competitive candidates and in fact, a few slots at the Academy are reserved specifically for the top student graduates. This year, thirteen seniors are graduating as the inaugural class of the High School Fire-fighter Program. It is my honor to include in the R
ECORD the names of the following grad-uates: Crisol Alvis Rodriguez, Nicholas Arko, Anna Fuentes, Joshua Hone, Alex Hurd, Henry Ji-menez-Reyes, Nathan Leite, Gillian Mudge, Michael Murn, Jarod Rambo, Ben Rothwell, Richard Verrier, Leah Walters. Mr. Speaker, the Fairfax County Fire and Rescue Department is one of the best fire de-partments in the country and in the world. I commend the department as well as the public school system for partnering in the creation of this program. I also applaud these young peo-ple for their desire to learn more about the de-partment and for their interest in protecting our community. Northern Virginia is fortunate to have such dedicated young citizens. I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating these students on their successful completion of this program and in wishing them great future suc-cess.

It is an honor to recognize the Residence Inn on its 20th anni-versary and celebrate this extraordinary ac-complishment. Opening their doors in 1997, the Residence Inn Fair Lakes filled a need in the community for high quality yet affordable accommoda-tions. Being located in a prime location, the Residence Inn attracts a wide variety of trav-elers from short stay tourists to longer-term business professionals. Its proximity to Dulles and National Airports, the thriving high-tech re-gion of the Dulles corridor, Fair Oaks Mall, George Mason University, countless res-taurants, and of course Washington, D.C., has made the Residence Inn Fair Lakes a premier destination. In 20 years, the Fair Lakes region of our county has witnessed explosive growth and expansion in residential as well as corporate development. Residence Inn Fair Lakes has positioned itself to give business travelers, both domestic and international, a place to stay that is like a home away from home. In addition to providing exceptional accom-modations to business and leisure travelers, Residence Inn Fair Lakes also offers exten-sive event planning services. Corporate meet-ings, conferences and training sessions are frequently scheduled at the Residence Inn Fair Lakes. Social events including engagement parties, showers, and family reunions are made even more special through the out-standing customer service provided by the fa-cility and its staff. And of course, the wedding services and receptions held at the Residence Inn are meticulously planned. No detail is overlooked and the beautiful setting makes the event even more memorable. The motto of the Commonwealth of Virginia is: ‘‘Virginia is for Lovers.’’ The management and staff of the Residence Inn embodies that motto through its hospitality, generosity, kind-ness, exemplary customer service, and reli-ability. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the Residence Inn Fair Lakes on its 20th anniversary and in wishing it continued success.

BARBARA A. ZDRAVECKY 
HON. KATHY CASTOR 
OF FLORIDA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 19, 2017 Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the distinguished career and leadership of ‘‘one of country’s most influ-ential advocates for women’s rights,’’ Barbara A. Zdravecky. She is retiring after serving 24 years as the CEO of Planned Parenthood of Southwest and Central Florida. I am honored to recognize her selfless service and valuable contributions during these challenging times for the health rights of women. A Pennsylvania native, Barbara graduated from the Indiana University of Pennsylvania and earned her nursing degree from Manatee County’s State College of Florida. Barbara served as head nurse of Manatee Memorial Hospital’s Psychiatric Program and later served as the Patient Care Coordinator of the First Hospice Program in Key West, primarily caring for HIV/AIDS patients. In 1993, Barbara accepted the offer to lead Planned Parenthood of Southwest Florida as its Chief Executive Of-ficer where she continues to serve and live by their mission to provide comprehensive health care, education, and advocacy for women of all walks of life. Throughout her career, Barbara advocated to ensure that women have the information and care they need to live strong, healthy lives and fulfill their dreams—no ceilings, no limits. She successfully fought countless legislative battles and then brought legal challenges when the legislative body overreached, such as Florida’s House Bill 1411, the Termination of Pregnancies and Planned Parenthood of Southwest and Central Florida v. Celeste Phil-ip, that would have blocked access to health care for women and their families. She kept up the good fight on all attempts to protect against attempts to cut funding for or defund Planned Parenthood altogether. Under Barbara’s leadership, Planned Par-enthood grew in stature into the Planned Par-enthood of Southwest and Central Florida in 2015. Planned Parenthood of Southwest and Central Florida now covers 22 counties with 11 health centers serving over 45,000 patients in Florida. Barbara was also instrumental in engineer-ing regional headquarters in Sarasota and constructing the new building at 736 Central Avenue where the health care provider has expanded its services. In September, it be-came the first in Florida to offer hormone ther-apy for transgender patients. Barbara has received numerous awards and accolades for her dedicated service. In 2006, Barbara was honored with the Ruth Green Award as the top Planned Parenthood CEO in the country by Planned Parenthood Federation of America. Equality Florida presented her with the ‘‘2014 Voice for Equality Award’’ and in 2015, she was named ‘‘Wonder Woman’’ by the Women’s Resource Center of Manatee County. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the citizens of Florida, my neighbors in the Tampa Bay com-munity and women everywhere, I would like to take this opportunity to thank one of the great champions of women’s health and equal rights, Barbara A. Zdravecky, for her many years of service and contributions fighting for the rights of women and their families. It is with great honor and joy to congratulate Bar-bara on her new endeavor as well as the many accomplishments she has had through-out her career, and I know together we will keep up the good fight. TRIBUTE TO COLLETTA GILLETT HON. DAVID YOUNG 
OF IOWA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 19, 2017 Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Colletta Gillett of Clarinda, Iowa on the occasion of her 103rd birthday. Colletta was born on Novem-ber 11, 1914. Our world has changed a great deal during the course of Colletta’s life. Since her birth, we have revolutionized air travel and walked on the moon. We have invented the television, cellular phones and the internet. We have fought in wars overseas, seen the rise and fall of Soviet communism and witnessed the birth of new democracies. Colletta has lived through eighteen United States Presidents and twenty-two Governors of Iowa. In her lifetime, the population of the United States has more than tripled. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to represent Colletta in the United States Congress and it is my pleasure to wish her a very happy 103rd birthday. I ask that my colleagues in the United States House of Representatives join me in congratulating her on reaching this in-credible milestone, and in wishing her nothing but the best.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 105TH BIRTHDAY OF GEORGE N. LEIGH-TON 
HON. WILLIAM R. KEATING 
OF MASSACHUSETTS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 19, 2017 Mr. KEATING. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the Honorable George N. Leigh-ton, who turns 105 years young on October 22nd. George was born in New Bedford to Anna Silva Garcia and Antonio Neves Leitao, who emigrated from the Cape Verde Islands. Dur-ing his childhood, George and his siblings helped their parents who worked as agricul-tural laborers, and they only attended school for a few months a year. It was while working as a cranberry bog weeder that George first decided to pursue a career in law. George finished school after the 7th grade and, while working in restaurant kitchens, started taking night classes. He then pursued a degree at Howard University, after he was able to prove he could complete college level work. This was the first time he would use English as his primary language. In 1940, George graduated magna cum laude from Howard University and held a commission as a Second Lieutenant in the U.S. Army Re-serves Officer Training Corps. An aspiring lawyer, George would stop at nothing and entered Harvard Law School with a scholarship later that year. As the United States entered World War II, George served in the Pacific Theater for almost three years and was awarded the Asiatic Pacific Service Medal, Bronze Star. Discharged as a Captain in 1945, George reentered Harvard Law School. He then passed the Massachusetts bar in 1946 and established his law practice in Chicago.

George faced heavy racial discrimination and was not allowed to join the American Bar Association or the Chicago Bar Association. Despite this atmosphere, he became one of the most prominent and respected criminal de-fense lawyers in Illinois. George often worked as the court-appointed defense counsel for crimes of violence and with the NAACP and ACLU on cases of racial segregation. During this time he worked closely with Thurgood Marshall, among others, and was asked to represent Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. George fought tirelessly for equal voting rights, desegregation in schools, open housing, the right to sit on juries, abolishing the death pen-alty; and fairness in the criminal justice sys-tem. In 1964, George was elected to the Circuit Court of Cook County, where he gained rec-ognition as one of the finest criminal court judges. Later, in 1969, he was appointed to the First District Appellate Court of Illinois. After gaining a reputation as one of the most thoughtful and fair jurists, President Gerald Ford appointed George to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois in 1976. After retiring in 1987 at the age of 75, George returned to the private practice of law to work on civil and criminal litigation, and to continue to teach at John Marshall Law School. A member of the bar for over 70 years, George exemplifies service to his community. He led his life fighting for a fair criminal justice system and, in 2011, George played a key role in successfully abolishing the death pen-alty in Illinois. In addition to the many honors George has received throughout his years fighting for equality, the U.S. Postal Service in New Bedford was also renamed after him, as the ‘‘Honorable Judge George N. Leighton Post Office Building.’’ Mr. Speaker, I am proud to recognize the Honorable George N. Leighton on this joyous occasion of his 105th birthday. I ask that my colleagues join me in wishing him many more years of health and happiness.

RECOGNIZING THE CATHOLICS FOR HOUSING, INCORPORATED 2017 FATHER GERARD CREEDON HOUSING AWARD RECIPIENTS 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 19, 2017 Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to rec-ognize the anniversary of Catholics for Hous-ing, Incorporated and to congratulate the Fa-ther Gerard Creedon Housing Award recipi-ents. Catholics for Housing, Incorporated was es-tablished in 1979 by Father Gerard Creedon and a dedicated group of community mem-bers. Together they began working to expand affordable housing options and prevent home-lessness in response to the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops’ Pastoral Let-ter entitled, ‘‘The Right to a Decent Home.’’ Now in its 38th year, Catholics for Housing has grown substantially in both breadth of mis-sion and clientele. Since its inception, the or-ganization has expanded to provide assist-ance in 21 counties within the vicinity of the Arlington Catholic Diocese. The organization has adapted over the years with new goals and a renewed vision while remaining true to its core mission of col-laborating with others to support the develop-ment, construction, and rehabilitation of afford-able housing, as well as to provide senior cit-izen rental assistance, security deposit assist-ance, and collaborative education and advo-cacy efforts. Catholics for Housing provides a continuum of housing through life skills train-ing, senior rental assistance in Fairfax County, down payment assistance in Prince William, Fairfax, Arlington and Loudoun Counties, se-curity deposit assistance, rental homes in Vi-enna, Arlington, Fairfax and Fredericksburg and homeownership opportunities. Catholics for Housing is sustained through the dedication and generosity of its board, staff, volunteers, and many community part-ners. It is my honor to include in the RECORD  the following Catholics for Housing partners for sustaining the vision established by Father Creedon and our dedicated community mem-bers. The 2017 Father Gerard Creedon Hous-ing Award honorees are St. Mary of Sorrows Catholic Church and Ms. Alice G. Haase. St. Mary of Sorrows Catholic Church and its parishioners are a Catholic community com-mitted to nourishing through education and to proclaiming and promoting social justice. Through the St. Mary of Sorrows Catholic Church Tithing Fund Allocation, the church has generously provided grants to Catholics for Housing. For the last twelve years, St. Mary of Sorrows has provided funding to en-sure the sustainment of the Virginia Ely Senior Rental Assistance Program and the Edie Streett Security Deposit Assistance Program. Due to their continued support, the annual funding provided by St. Mary of Sorrows Catholic Church covers the expenses so that two seniors may live independently for a year and covers the security deposit for 10 rental homes. Alice G. Haase, Esquire is the co-founder of CastroHaase PLLC, a commercial real estate law firm located in Washington, D.C. She dedicates much of her spare time to the bet-terment of the community. Alice has extended her services to Catholics for Housing to in-crease access to affordable housing through-out Northern Virginia and further the reach of programs in the community. In recognition of the efficacy of the unique programs offered, Catholics for Housing has received numerous awards and honors. Catholics for Housing has been recognized by the U.S. Housing and Urban Development for ‘‘Best Practices’’ and received the Best New Project in Northern Virginia Award and an Ar-lington Community Award. In addition, the or-ganization was named ‘‘One of the Best’’ by the Catalogue of Philanthropy in 2005–06 and again in 2011–12. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the 2017 Father Gerard Creedon Housing Award recipients and in commending the efforts of Catholics for Hous-ing, Incorporated, its board, staff, and dedi-cated volunteers who work tirelessly to provide needed support and assistance to many in our community. HONORING THE KERN WATER BANK AUTHORITY FOR TWENTY YEARS OF SUCCESSFUL OPER-ATION HON. KEVIN McCARTHY 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 19, 2017 Mr. M
CCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today and am joined by my colleagues from Cali-fornia, Congressman D
AVID VALADAO and Con- gressman J
IMCOSTA , to recognize an essen-tial resource in our community—the Kern Water Bank—and the incredibly positive im-pact that it has made upon California’s Central Valley over the past twenty years. This year, the Kern Water Bank celebrates twenty years since the signing of the 75 year Habitat Conservation Plan, which allowed the Water Bank to begin operating at its full ca-pacity in the heart of California’s San Joaquin Valley. Prior to this monumental agreement, the roughly 32-square mile stretch of land on which the Kern Water Bank operates today was used largely for farming while California experienced wide fluctuations in water supply. The creation of the Kern Water Bank Authority and eventually the Kern Water Bank exempli-fies the innovative and determined spirit of the Kern community and the effectiveness with which this community has been able to assist in meeting California’s water needs. Prior to the creation of the Kern Water Bank Authority, the California Department of Water Resources sought to create a system that would serve as a response to the water short-ages that often plagued California’s agricul-tural community. The Department of Water Resources struggled for years to achieve any-thing tangible—facing various legal, institu-tional, and environmental setbacks that made the project seem nearly impossible. It was at this point that the Kern Water Bank Authority came to fruition, and through the hard work and cooperation of both public and private contributors, the Kern Water Bank was finally feasible. Now, after twenty years of successful operation, we recognize the degree to which the Kern Water Bank has impacted Califor-nia’s water situation, the greater San Joaquin environment and the Central Valley community that Congressman V
ALADAO , Congressman C
OSTA and I share. The daily operations and functions of the Kern Water Bank greatly assisted in com-bating the drought that has plagued California, especially throughout the past five years. As Delta pumping was slowly reduced, the Kern Water Bank served a particularly important purpose as the prominent storage facility for the water that local farmers and agricultural communities needed even more desperately in light of the drought. Additionally, the Kern Water Bank has become a notable wildlife re-source of regional significance. The environ-ment created by the Kern Water Bank sup-ports many special-status species in alignment with the Habitat Conservation Plan and EPA standards, and creates a unique wetlands area that serves as a refuge for local wildlife. Very rarely do projects of this nature serve so many purposes all at once, and we believe that the Kern Water Bank serves as the ideal model for other similar projects. The Kern Water Bank is the largest oper-ation of its kind in California, and has even

HONORING LARRY MISHEL 
HON. KEITH ELLISON 
OF MINNESOTA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 19, 2017 Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, for more than 30 years, trickle-down economics has influ-enced our policies to redistribute economic power to the top. My friend and outgoing Executive Director, Larry Mishel has long been at the forefront of developing progressive economic alternatives to counter the popularity and effectiveness of trickle-down theory. Thanks in large part to his research; we know trickle-down policies gave us slower growth and stagnant wages for working families. Throughout his career—before, becoming President of the Economic Policy Institute— Larry focused on researching the wages of working people and making the case for ac-tions that would raise these wages. He real-ized how important power was in this equa-tion, and so he argued for measures to im-prove the rights of working people to organize and bargain for higher wages. Larry’s work on the discrepancy between wages and productivity, and his analysis of skyrocketing CEO pay, were the first of their kind. Larry has expanded on and refined this research over the last 30 years. Larry’s recent work focuses on workers’ rights and how the erosion of unions has hurt working people— union and non-union alike. Throughout his career, Larry Mishel has cre-ated a necessary counter balance to the ‘‘common knowledge’’ Wall Street approach to economic policy in the U.S. He did this through his own research, but also by building EPI up as a research organization willing to take on the conventional wisdom in either party. We all know the immeasurable contribution Larry and EPI have made to successive cam-paigns to raise minimum wages at the federal and state levels. For years, EPI’s Policy Cen-ter has provided the economic analysis of the Progressive Caucus budget. We know the budget adds up, would boost wages, and would, in time, lower the deficit. We know it would build better infrastructure and a better education system because EPI, under Larry’s leadership, runs all the numbers for us, and alerts us if our plans threaten to come up short in any way. Larry’s contribution is incred-ibly valuable as it provides a concrete frame-work for our fight to support working folks across the country. After 30 years at EPI—15 as President— Larry is stepping aside at the end of 2017. He will continue to provide innovative research on the rights and wages of working people. And, he will remain at EPI as a senior researcher. Thea Lee, who is the incoming President, will have big shoes to fill. However, Thea is the perfect fit to build on Larry’s legacy and EPI’s work on behalf of low- and middle-income families. I want to extend a heartfelt thanks to Larry for his years of service, and I look forward to seeing the incredible work he will do in the months and years to come. f 
RECOGNIZING THE FAIRFAX FED-ERATION OF CITIZENS ASSOCIA-TIONS 2017 CITIZEN OF THE YEAR AWARD RECIPIENTS 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 19, 2017 Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to rec-ognize the Fairfax Federation of Citizens As-sociations on the occasion of its 67th Annual Citizen of the Year Awards Banquet. The Fed-eration is a coalition of civic and homeowners associations who work together to promote and support initiatives that will benefit all. Each year, the Federation honors a few select individuals for their extraordinary contributions to our community. As a former two-term Presi-dent of the Federation, I understand that those who volunteer their time, energies, and talents to civic activities play a vital role in making Fairfax County one of the best places in the nation in which to live, work, and raise a fam-ily. I am honored to recognize the following in-dividuals for their service to our community: 2017 Citizen of the Year: Joseph Chudzik: ‘‘A model citizen with a passion for serving his community.’’ A more apt description could not be found. Joe’s contributions to his community are many and varied, from Boy Scouts to the Mason Neck Lions Club to serving as a volun-teer at polling stations on Election Day. Joe’s passion for service also extends far beyond the borders of Fairfax County. He has served in the Peace Corps, as a Foreign Service Offi-cer in the U.S. Department of State and in the U.S. Air Force. One would not think it was possible to find so many different ways to serve, but Joe has shown that it is. We should all strive to mirror his example. Citation of Merit: Cheryl Ellsworth: Cheryl is receiving this citation for an issue that is close to my heart, namely affordable housing. Dur-ing my time on the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors, I worked to address this impor-tant issue in conjunction with combatting homelessness. Cheryl has shown similar dedi-cation to these causes through her work with Good Shepherd Housing and Family Services. Her work has received numerous accolades, including the Washington Post Award for Ex-cellence in Nonprofit Management and the Fairfax County Nonprofit of the Year Award. Citation of Merit: Emily McCoy: Emily is cur-rently serving her 35th year on the Fairfax County Commission for Women and has spent her entire career fighting for the rights of women and girls. Emily has also been a lead-er in Fairfax County’s efforts to combat the scourge of domestic violence and served as the representative for the Commission for Women to the County’s Domestic Violence Prevention, Policy and Coordinating Council for five years. Citation of Merit: Ken Balbuena: Ken has distinguished himself as a tireless and effec-tive advocate for his community. As President of the North Springfield Civic Association, he has worked to revive County ordinances re-garding the upkeep of lawns in neighbor-hoods, established traffic calming measures to combat speeding and successfully lobbied for the local crossing guard to receive traffic con-trol training. In each of these instances, as well as many others, Ken has kept the com-munity informed on his progress and success-fully solicited their input to guide the process according to the will of the neighborhood. He is truly a testament to effective volunteer lead-ership. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking these incredible individuals and in congratulating them on being honored by the Fairfax County Federation of Citizens’ Asso-ciations. Civic engagement is the foundation of a healthy conununity, and Fairfax County resi-dents enjoy an exceptional quality of life due in part to the efforts of these individuals. The contributions and leadership of these hon-orees have been a great benefit to our com-munity and truly merit our highest praise.

Shiloh is known for its work to put faith into action through community-based programs of outreach to neighbors. During the harsh, cold weather months, the church runs an emer-gency shelter for families and individuals ex-periencing homelessness through the PADS Lake County program. This critical service of-fers some of our neediest people the imme-diate shelter they need to stay safe and warm, as well as the more comprehensive resources needed to get out of homelessness and back into permanent housing. In addition, the church organizes a weekly soup kitchen and offers a food pantry available for those in need. Shiloh also takes seriously the spiritual de-velopment of all its members, through Chris-tian education and young adult ministry, as well as outreach to those who cannot attend services, including the sick, elderly, and those incarcerated at the Lake County Jail. For the last 25 years, Shiloh has been ably led by Pastor Wallstone E. Francis, a dedi-cated minister to his congregation, scholar of the Scripture, and active leader in the conununity. This l00th Anniversary is themed ‘‘Embrac-ing Our Past. Enriching Our Present. Envi-sioning Our Future.’’ I congratulate the entire Shiloh family on this anniversary and look forward to working with them to enrich our neighborhoods and envision a better future for the communities we love.

HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 19, 2017 Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to con-gratulate the Fairfax County Fire and Rescue Department on the graduation of the 141st Recruit Class. As they prepare to join the ranks of the Fairfax County Fire and Rescue Department, I encourage the 42 graduates to reflect on the history of the department and the contributions and dedication of the brave men and women who have served before them to protect our community. The Fairfax County Fire and Rescue De-partment’s Recruit School consists of an ex-tensive and demanding 30-week program. In addition to two weeks of orientation, recruits completed eight weeks of EMT training and twenty weeks of fire suppression training. Upon graduation, these recruits will be cer-tified at the level of Firefighter I/II by the Vir-ginia Department of Fire Programs. These recruits have the distinct honor of joining one of the best Fire and Rescue De-partments in the United States. The efforts of the Fairfax County Fire and Rescue Depart-ment have been recognized across this coun-try. Members from the Department serve on the elite VA Task Force I, which is among the first units called to disaster zones to provide search and rescue support. Members of that Task Force were recognized by the Inter-national Association of Fire Chiefs with the Benjamin Franklin Award for Valor as a result of their efforts in the aftermath of the dev-astating earthquakes that struck Nepal in 2015. As the newest members of the Fire and Rescue Department, the 141st Recruit Class graduates join the department as integral parts of our community’s emergency response and public safety team. I am confident that this graduating class will serve the residents of Fairfax County with honor and distinction. It is my great honor to include in the R
ECORD the names of the 141st Recruit Class: Allen E. Bizzell, Calvin W. Branch, Matthew N. Bui, Laura E. Calkins, James T. Campbell, Melissa M. Cary, Che-Shien Chu, Mari A. Christenson, Antonio J.

IN RECOGNITION OF MS. LILLY PIMENTEL 
HON. DAVID G. VALADAO 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 19, 2017 Mr. VALADAO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Ms. Lilly Pimentel on receiving the 2017 Kings County Farm Bureau Presi-dent’s Award. At the 99th Annual Meeting of the Kings County Farm Bureau, Ms. Pimentel will be recognized as an individual who has gone above and beyond for our local community and honored for her long-term commitment to the students and future leaders of California’s agriculture industry. Lilly Pimentel was born and raised in Han-ford, California and grew up on her parent’s, Joe and Esther Pimentel, dairy farm. She graduated from Hanford High School in 1992 and then attended the College of the Se-quoias. In 1994, Lilly began studying at Cali-fornia Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, where she received her Bachelor’s and Master’s Degrees in Agriculture Edu-cation. Between 1998 and 2001, Ms. Pimentel served as an Agriculture Teacher, educating students at Westmont High School, Gustine Unified School District, Riverdale Unified School District, and College of the Sequoias. In 2001, she accepted a position at her own Alma Mater, Hanford High School, where she continues to teach Ag Biology, Ag Science and Veterinary Science today.

IN RECOGNITION OF ANNE SEELEY 
HON. WILLIAM R. KEATING 
OF MASSACHUSETTS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 19, 2017 Mr. KEATING. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Anne Seeley for her commend-able years of service to her community and her country. Anne spent her college years encouraging debate on international issues and current events. She helped create and also led orga-nizations that addressed preserving civil lib-erties and women’s rights, among other impor-tant topics. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, Anne was recruited for a secret training program in cryp-tography sponsored by the U.S. Navy. As a senior in college, she attended these trainings at night after class, along with twenty other students. She graduated from Smith College in 1942 and answered the call to join the Navy. As part of the Women Accepted for Vol-unteer Emergency Service (WAVES) program, she was an invaluable asset working around the clock to decipher the principal Japanese naval codes. After the war, Anne went on to receive her Master’s degree from Columbia University. She dedicated her career to teaching history, English, and Latin. Not one to rest on her lau-rels, Anne and her husband would spend their free time tutoring students who did not have access to the educational opportunities that every child deserves. Their hard work paid off and the initiative became known as the Read-ing is Fundamental project in Newark, New Jersey, which continues to serve students to this day. Anne remains an active member of her community on Cape Cod. She has served on several town committees and has never missed a town meeting or election. Anne con-tinues to work tirelessly to encourage others to join the conversation, get involved, and vote. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to honor Anne Seeley for her dedication to her community and country. I ask that my colleagues join me in thanking her for her work and wishing her all the best as she continues her efforts.

JAMES T. DRUMM FOR 50 YEARS OF PUBLIC SERVICE 
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 19, 2017 Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, it is a great pleas-ure for me to rise and recognize a pillar of the Hastings-On-Hudson community, James T. Drumm, who for 50 years has dedicated him-self to public service and helping others as a integral part of the Hastings-On-Hudson Fire Department at the Riverview Manor Hose Company No. 3. I am honored to be able to offer this recognition to such a dedicated serv-ant of the people. James has done a tremendous amount for Hastings, but his service actually began in the United States Marine Corps, where he was active duty from 1955 to 1957. As a former member ofthe Armed Forces, it was only fitting that, upon his discharge, James would con-tinue on a path of serving the public good. He went on to join the Hastings Fire Department, rising through the ranks to become Chief of Department from 1987–1989 and again from 1995–1997. He also served as Deputy Chief, Ambulance Corp Member, Fire Police Officer, and, today, remains active as Village Fire In-spector. I am very fortunate and proud to represent such a distinguished public servant as James, and after a half-century of remarkable work in service to his country and local community, he too should feel tremendously proud. I want to thank James for all he has done on behalf of Hastings and our grateful nation. f 
IN RECOGNITION OF KONNI MCMURRY BEING NAMED THE MOORE COUNTY WOMAN OF THE YEAR 
HON. RICHARD HUDSON 
OF NORTH CAROLINA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 19, 2017 Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Konni McMurray for receiving the Moore County Woman of the Year Award. This award is presented by the Moore County Community Foundation to an individual who has exhibited selflessness and a humble desire to serve their community. Mrs. McMurray earned this award by putting others before herself and for her decades of service to Moore County. Originally from a suburb of Kansas City, Konni moved to Moore County in 1989 with her husband, Brian. Currently she is the Vice President of McMurray Fabrics in Aberdeen and Atex Technologies in Pinebluff. Mr. and Mrs. McMurray have provided hundreds of good-paying jobs to the community over the years, but despite her business success, Konni still finds time to support numerous local service organizations. She has served on the Boards of The O’Neal School, the Boys and Girls Club of the Sandhills, and Sandhills Community College, just to name a few. Konni has also been a tireless advocate for the less fortunate animals in Moore County through her leadership with the Moore County Society of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA)— when she can’t find a foster home for a pet in need, she’s been known to foster the animals personally. Konni and her husband, Brian, have four amazing children, and she’s instilled the same servant’s heart in all of them. I am extremely grateful to count Konni McMurray as a friend, and I know everyone in Moore County is even more grateful for her service and leadership to our community. Mr. Speaker, please join me today in hon-oring Konni McMurray for being named the Moore County Woman of the Year.

HONORING WILLIAM F. HENDER-SON III, PRESIDENT OF CWA LOCAL 1298 ON THE OCCASION OF HIS RETIREMENT

ELAURO. Mr. Speaker, it is my great pleasure to rise today to join the many family, friends, and colleagues who have gathered to pay tribute to William F. Henderson III as he retires after forty-three years of dedicated service in the communications industry and, most recently, as the President of the Commu-nications Workers of America Local 1298. A frame man and then centralized power technician, over the course of his career, Bill worked for Southern New England Telephone, SBC Company and AT&T before moving to a full-time position at the CWA Local 1298. Bill was active in labor issues from the beginning of his career and served as a steward for thir-ty years before his election as President. Dur-ing his tenure, he has guided his members through the transition of company mergers and buyouts and he has fought to protect fair wages and access to quality health benefits, ensure safe workplaces, and preserve retire-ment security. He has long been a fierce ad-vocate and tireless voice on behalf of his brothers and sisters in the CWA. In addition to his professional career, Bill has volunteered countless hours to his com-munity. In Waterford, he served for thirteen years as a member of the Representative Town Meeting where he was Chair of the Fi-nance Committee, six years on the Board of Selectmen, eight years as Chairman of the Waterford Industrial Development Committee and served on the Library Board of Trustees and the shellfish commission. In East Lyme, he served two terms on the Board of Edu-cation as well as the Zoning Board of Appeals. His is an example of public service to which we should all strive. I would be remiss if I did not thank Bill for his counsel and collaboration over the years. He has always been just a phone call away and I cherish the strong bond of friendship we have built. Today, as he marks his retirement, I hope he knows that the CWA Local 1298 will simply not be the same without him. I am proud to stand today to extend my deepest thanks and sincere appreciation to

Since its concep-tion, CACS has successfully continued to bring awareness to the cultural and historic significance of Chinese Americans and Asian Pacific Islander Americans and their crucial contributions to American society. The Chi-nese American Council of Sacramento has championed a myriad of social justice issues that plague its community, from discrimination to voter education. Their work to protect and ensure the civil and human rights of the most vulnerable within their community speaks to their tireless dedication to the advancement of Asian-Pacific Islander Americans throughout the greater Sacramento area. Congratulations on thirty years of exceptional service to our community. We also celebrate Mr. Clarence Chu as the Hall of Fame inductee. Mr. Chu is being rec-ognized for his enduring contributions to the Chinese American and Asian Pacific Islander American community. The Sacramento Chi-nese Community Service Center is being rec-ognized with the community service award for the outstanding programs it provides. The community center provides health, human, and social services to immigrants, refugees, and other underserved individuals in Sac-ramento. Through these programs and their quality education services, The Sacramento Chinese Community Service Center success-fully aids its community members in becoming economically self-sufficient and empowered. Mr. Speaker, as members and friends of The Chinese American Council of Sacramento celebrate their Gold Mountain Celebration, I ask all my colleagues to join me in the cele-bration of their 30th anniversary and give rec-ognition to all that this exemplary institution has given our community over the past three decades.

OF NORTH CAROLINA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 19, 2017 Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Earl Wright for receiving the Moore County Man of the Year Award in North Caro-lina’s Eighth Congressional District. This award is presented by the Moore County Community Foundation to an individual who has exhibited selflessness and a humble desire to serve their community. Mr. Wright earned this award by starting Project Santa, which refurbishes bicycles to distribute to thousands of children on Christmas Day each year. Project Santa started out 22 years ago as a small side-project with only 17 bikes, and has now grown exponentially into a military- sized operation that will distribute some 1,600 bikes this Christmas. As you can see, much like the real Saint Nick, Mr. Wright works year- round to deliver joy to children each Christ-mas. Mr. Wright has shown the recipients of these bikes—and the community at large— what it means to truly serve and give to those who need it most. My hope is people will see what Mr. Wright has done for his community and replicate his ambition to help their fellow man. I am extremely grateful for Mr. Wright’s service to our community and I wish him con-tinued success. Mr. Speaker, please join me today in hon-oring Earl Wright for his service to our com-munity and being named the Moore County Man of the Year.

RECOGNIZING THE NORTHERN VIR-GINIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE 2017 DISTINGUISHED SERVICE AWARD RECIPIENTS HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 19, 2017 Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to rec-ognize the recipients of the 2nd Annual Distin-guished Service Awards. I applaud the North-ern Virginia Chamber of Commerce for spon-soring these awards. Celebrating the achieve-ments of our veterans is important because our veterans in Northern Virginia have sac-rificed so much for our community and our na-tion. It is critical that we all take the steps to honor and uphold the sacred agreement be-tween our society and our veterans. I am hon-ored to recognize the following individuals for their service to our community: Veteran Business Mentorship Award: Com-munity Business Partnership: Community Business Partnership has been an incredible tool for veterans considering starting a small business and veteran business owners in Vir-ginia. Their Veteran Business Outreach Cen-ters demonstrate their dedication to our com-munity by setting up veterans with training, counseling, and necessary resources for suc-cess. These centers also offer regular oppor-tunities for veteran business owners to net-work and collaborate. The mentorship pro-vided at these centers has been exceptional and critical to supporting those who have dedi-cated their lives to our country. Meritorious Veteran Owned Business (Emerging): Semper K9: After six oversea de-ployments, founder Christopher Baity has sought to provide trained service dogs to physically and emotionally support veterans and their families. His nonprofit gives veterans with physical impairments or PTSD dogs who can assist them. This service is so important because our veterans deserve all the support they can get when dealing with physical and emotional hardship after service. Meritorious Veteran Owned Business (Es-tablished): Strategy and Management Serv-ices, Inc. (SAMS): SAMS is an exceptionally charitable and active organization in our Northern Virginia community that produces sustainable careers and annual community service programs. SAMS promotes social awareness and volunteerism through a variety of volunteer programs, which raise money, collect donations, and provide food services for Virginians who need it most. This organiza-tion is so important to our community for its support and for providing the opportunity for Virginians to volunteer and give back to the greater community. Lifetime Achievement Award: Mr. Jerry D. Norris, Battlespace, Inc.: As president of Battlespace, Inc., Mr. Norris is responsible for negotiating, overseeing, managing and direct-ing all aspects of corporate business. Prior to his career in the private sector, Mr. Norris served in the United States Navy for 28 years, retiring in 1992 as a Captain. After his retire-ment from the Navy, he focused his energies on improving the business landscape in North-ern Virginia, serving as Chairman of both the Arlington Economic Development Commission and the Crystal City Business Improvement District. Mr. Norris also served as a member of the Arlington BRAC Transition Working Group, helping the community respond and re- orient itself to the new realities of BRAC. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking these incredible individuals and in congratulating them on their awards. Civic en-gagement is the foundation of a healthy com-munity, and Fairfax County residents enjoy an exceptional quality of life due in part to the ef-forts of these individuals. The contributions and leadership of these honorees have been a great benefit to our community and truly merit our highest praise.

HONORING GEORGE GEVAS FOR 50 YEARS OF PUBLIC SERVICE 
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 19, 2017 Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, it is always an honor for me to recognize constituents who have given so selflessly to the communities I represent. When it comes to Hastings-On- Hudson, few individuals have been as selfless and dedicated to improving the public good as George Gevas, who this year will mark his 50th year of public service in the community. George has certainly had a storied career in Hastings, first joining the Hastings Fire Depart-ment in June of 1967 and completing the Es-sentials of Firemanship within 2 years. After 20 years of service, he reached the rank of Captain in the department, and subsequent became both a Fire Inspector and Fire Police Officer. Today, George serves as the Village Police Commissioner, solidifying his unparalleled leg-acy of public service to Hastings. Though that’s not the only legacy he has left. Those in Hastings familiar with the annual Kid’s Christ-mas Run hosted by the Uniontown Hose Com-pany will know that George was in fact the very first man to ever portray Santa Claus at the event; just another example of his good- hearted nature and love for his friends and neighbors. Few individuals have ever given as much to their community as George Gevas, and Has-tings has been incredibly fortunate to have him. I want to congratulate George on a re-markable half-century of public service and thank him for all he has done to strengthen his neighborhood.

COMMENDING CHIEF MASTER SERGEANT LARRY W. MEADE 
HON. DON BACON 
OF NEBRASKA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 19, 2017 Mr. BACON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend a distinguished serviceman and member of the 55th Wing, CMSgt (ret) Larry W. Meade. Chief Master Sergeant Meade served our country with honor, dedicating the past 44 years of his life to the 55th Wing, as a loyal Airman and a contractor with L–3 Technologies. During his time as an Airman, Chief Meade always exceeded expectations and estab-lished himself as an invaluable piece of the 55th Wing’s history. He oversaw all mission system maintenance in the CENTCOM area of responsibility (AOR) throughout the early days of Operations DESERT STORM and DESERT SHIELD. Because of his work, the Rivet Joint cemented Its role as key player in the devel-opment of the Air Force’s Electronic Order of Battle, enabling air-strike planning and the elimination of countless high value enemy tar-gets. Armed with his wealth of experience, Chief Meade continued his service to our nation and our military as a contractor. During his 18 years with L–3 Technologies, he again proved to be a critical part of the 55th Wing’s suc-cess. He oversaw the seamless upgrade of 10 minor and 11 major RC–135 mission system baseline updates, an amazing feat. Addition-ally, Chief Meade facilitated over 150 one time inspections, 200 contract field team visits, 450 maintenance bulletins and 600 engineering technical assistance requests. Chief Meade has a long, proven, track record of accomplishment and devotion to the 55th Wing, of which I have been a member. Chief Meade leaves behind a legacy of mis-sion success, and countless successful Air-men that he has been able to mentor during his career. I am more than honored to com-mend him on the floor today.

REMEMBERING JAMES M. SCOTT 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 19, 2017 Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to a man who dedicated his life to the community he served. Delegate James M. ‘‘Jim’’ Scott was a tireless advocate for all and his life and deeds have left an indelible mark on the people of Fairfax County and the Com-monwealth of Virginia. Sadly, Jim passed away on April 13, 2017. However, his legacy lives on through the numerous community ini-tiatives he started and programs he helped create as well as in the hearts and minds of so many whose lives he touched. Born in Galax, Va. in 1938, Jim came to Fairfax County as a teacher at Thomas A. Edi-son High School. Shortly afterwards, he began to work with local non-profits providing assist-ance with anti-poverty and fair housing initia-tives. Jim’s quest to help others eventually led him to the Fairfax County Board of Super-visors, where he was elected Providence Dis-trict Representative in 1971. He continued his work on the issues he had dealt with in the non-profit community, introducing resolutions on affordable housing and human and civil rights. A constant champion for quality-of-life issues in the County, Jim used his voice to advocate for the most vulnerable among us and ensured that their needs were not forgot-ten. After serving 14 years on the Board of Su-pervisors, Jim was elected to the Virginia House of Delegates in 1991. His one-vote vic-tory after a six-week recount earned him the nickname ‘‘Landslide Jim’’, but his effect on the House of Delegates was truly earth-shak-ing. In 1995, he was the lead sponsor of the bill that would become the ‘‘Motor Voter’’ law in Virginia. This bill dramatically expanded ac-cess to voter registration in Virginia, allowing individuals to register to vote at locations such as Department of Motor Vehicles, employment and other state offices, as well as by mail. The primary beneficiaries of this legislation were the traditionally under-served and under-rep-resented whose causes Jim had made his life’s work. Once again, he had improved the lives of countless individuals for the better. That this was done over the objections of Vir-ginia’s sitting Governor at the time gives cre-dence to the tenacity with which Jim pursued his life’s mission. While some would have expected a life mis-sion such as Jim’s to be rooted in a political orthodoxy, they would have been surprised to learn the extent of his pragmatic side. He was a constant disciple of the saying ‘‘Do not let the perfect be the enemy of the good,’’ a piece of wisdom that he shared with his col-leagues on both the Board of Supervisors and in the House of Delegates on numerous occa-sions. Mr. Speaker, Virginia has lost a quiet, gentle but forceful advocate for all who feel power-less. Jim Scott was a voice for civil rights, women’s rights, and LGBT rights because he believed the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States meant what they said. Unusual for a politician, Jim was self-effacing. A natural mentor, he pro-moted talent and sought to bestow credit on others. He advanced the careers of myriad public officials. His generosity of spirit bene-fited causes throughout our Virginia Common-wealth. Most of that generosity was unheralded. Jim was a loving and devoted husband to his beloved wife Nancy and a proud dad to two extraordinary and accom-plished daughters, Casey and Mary. He was a devout Methodist, and passionate sports fan for North Carolina and the Washington Nation-als. It will be difficult to re-imagine the NOVA community without his towering presence and wise guidance. His absence will be a void for those of us privileged to know him. His was a life well-lived, and he will be missed.
