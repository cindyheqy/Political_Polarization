RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER  
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-jority leader is recognized. 
NOMINATION OF BRETT KAVANAUGH  
Mr. M CCONNELL. Madam President, if you stop and listen, you can prac-tically hear the Democrats trying to move the goalposts on Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Su-preme Court. Remember, before Judge Kavanaugh was even named, several Democrats on the Judiciary Committee indicated they would oppose whoever the nominee might turn out to be. The junior Senator from California, for example, explained on television that whomever President Trump chose would bring about ‘‘the destruction of the Constitution of the United States as far as I can tell.’’ That was, incred-ibly enough, from a member of the Ju-diciary Committee. Of course, mere hours after Judge Kavanaugh was announced, my friend, the Democratic leader, made the an-nouncement that has now become fa-mous. ‘‘I will oppose him with every-thing I’ve got,’’ he said. Not long after that, another Demo-crat on the Judiciary Committee pro-claimed that anyone supporting Judge Kavanaugh’s confirmation was—listen to this—‘‘complicit in the evil.’’ These statements are the context for every action the Democrats have taken during this entire process. These state-ments remind us: Democrats may be trying to move the goalposts every 5 minutes, but their goal has not moved an inch. They will not be satisfied un-less they have brought down Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination. It started with straightforward polit-ical maneuvering. None of it worked, of course, but there were whatever issues they could find to delay, delay, delay. First, back in June, the Democrats tried to argue that the Senate shouldn’t confirm a Supreme Court Justice in any even-numbered year. Then they were reminded that Justices Kagan, Breyer, and Souter were all confirmed during midterm election years, and that argument evaporated. Next, the Democrats said the process should be delayed because too few doc-uments were available from Judge Kavanaugh’s past public service. Well, then they received the most pages of documents ever produced for a Su-preme Court nomination. So guess what came next. The goalposts moved down the field, and the Democrats called for a delay because there were too many documents for them to read. I wish this fight could have remained in the realm of normalcy, but when none of these tactics worked—when Judge Kavanaugh demonstrated his widely acknowledged brilliance, open-mindedness, and collegiality at his confirmation hearings—some chose a darker road. The politics of personal destruction were willfully unleashed. I have spoken at length about the un-derhanded way the Democrats have treated Dr. Ford and her allegation. In brief, for 6 weeks, Dr. Ford’s confiden-tial account passed from one Demo-cratic Member of Congress to the Democratic side of the Judiciary Com-mittee, to the Washington, DC, lawyers whom the Senate Democrats hand-picked for her. Then, well after Judge Kavanaugh’s hearings had wrapped up,

the supposedly confidential letter found its way into the press—shoving aside proper procedure, shoving aside the accuser’s plea for privacy. This is not politics as usual because let us not forget that Dr. Ford’s allega-tion is not the only uncorroborated al-legation that has been breathlessly pa-raded around. Oh, no. Shortly after Dr. Ford’s confidential letter made its way into the press, the floodgates of mud and muck opened entirely on Brett Kavanaugh and his family. Out of the woodwork came one uncorroborated al-legation after another, each seemingly more outlandish than the last. A tabloid lawyer organized a red car-pet rollout for someone who wanted to accuse Judge Kavanaugh of master-minding some kind of high school drug and serial sexual assault ring—of hosting one wild party after another, filled with sexual violence, for which there conveniently happen to be zero witnesses but plenty of people to refute the claims. This didn’t stay in the tab-loids, by the way. This fantastic story was effectively read into the record of the Judiciary Committee by the rank-ing member, who decided it deserved a mention in her remarks during last Thursday’s hearing. Then every Demo-cratic member of the Judiciary Com-mittee seized on this outlandish tale in a formal letter in which they called on Judge Kavanaugh to withdraw his name from consideration. This is how desperate some became for any way to stop this stunningly qualified nominee. I guess upholding any standards of any kind was just too much to ask. We heard of another anonymous, unattributed, and now thoroughly de-bunked account—this time of an anon-ymous accusation from Colorado that alleged physical abuse 20 years ago. A sitting Federal district court judge quickly stepped up to bat down that anonymous smear. We heard that Judge Kavanaugh was supposedly responsible for a sexual as-sault on a boat in Newport, RI, until the accuser recanted the story com-pletely, but it was not before many in the media had begun eating it up. In short, the Democrats’ mishandling of Dr. Ford’s letter opened the flood-gates for this deluge of uncorroborated, unbelievable mud, and the mudslide was cheered on and capitalized on at every turn by the far left, which has been so eager to stop this nomination. Just politics? I don’t think so. On the other extreme, some of the other lines of attack have been com-pletely trivial. Last night, the New York Times unleashed this ‘‘major’’ story. Get this—Judge Kavanaugh may have been accused of throwing some ice across a college bar in the mid-1980s. Talk about a bombshell. One can only imagine what new bombshell might be published today or tomorrow. Here is what we know—one thing for sure: The Senate will vote on Judge Kavanaugh here on this floor this week. Our Democratic friends will try to move the goalposts yet again. Just yes-terday, they submitted a list of 24 peo-ple whom they want the FBI to inter-view. So I am confident we will hear that even the very same supplemental FBI investigation the Democrats had so loudly demanded will now, magi-cally, no longer be sufficient. Well, after the FBI shares what it has found, Senators will have the oppor-tunity to vote. We will have the oppor-tunity to vote no on the politics of per-sonal destruction. We will have the op-portunity to vote yes on this fine nominee. 
TAX REFORM  
Madam President, on an entirely dif-ferent matter, the U.S. economy con-tinues to deliver very good news. My home State of Kentucky is, certainly, no exception. Yesterday morning, I had the oppor-tunity to take part in the announce-ment of a major new investment in my hometown of Louisville. GE Appliances unveiled its plan to create 400 new jobs and to invest more than $200 million in Kentucky. It is expanding its laundry and dishwasher production facilities and is upgrading its capacity for inno-vation. GE’s Appliance Park—where nearly 6,000 currently work—has been a manu-facturing landmark in Louisville for more than six decades. The facility has meant a great deal to my community. At its height, it employed some 20,000 workers. However, following the slug-gish economy of the last decade, the workforce has shrunk to just one-fifth of its previous strength. So yesterday’s announcement marked a step in a very new direction—aggressive expansion, doubling down on American workers. It is the same story that is being written all over America by job creators, large and small. Where did the new direction come from? What changed? Well, for one thing, the policy climate here in Wash-ington changed. GE Appliances’ President and CEO Kevin Nolan said, ‘‘The changes in rates and favorable tax treatment of investments in machinery and equip-ment play a big role in our expansion plans’’—more jobs for Kentuckians, more prosperity for local communities. I would like to ask the men and women who will get one of these new jobs what they make of the fact that every single Democrat in Congress voted to block the tax reform that is helping this happen. The Republicans got it done anyway. We delivered sweeping tax cuts for workers and families. Now, thanks in part to our policies, the economy is thriving. Just last month, consumer confidence reached its highest level in 18 years. In other words, American families are feeling better about spend-ing and investing in their communities than they have felt since September of 2000. In September of 2000, the Senate pages serving here on the floor hadn’t even been born yet, but as these young folks continue their studies and enter the workforce, they will be partici-pating in an American economy with more opportunities, where workers keep more of their hard-earned pay-checks. That is the economy Repub-licans had in mind when we voted to enact generational tax reform and to lift the regulatory burden on investors and job creators. It is the economy we are continuing to work for every day. RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER  
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized. 
NOMINATION OF BRETT KAVANAUGH  
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I like the majority leader. We get along quite well. He even laughs at my jokes, which sometimes aren’t very good. We are very proud we are working on the appropriations bills together in a bi-partisan way, as this place ought to work. But sometimes his comments are so absurd and so filled with double standard, innuendo, and hypocrisy that you don’t know whether to laugh or cry. He has been on the floor every day saying that Democrats are causing delay. Democrats are causing delay? First, to say that Democrats are caus-ing delay, coming from the same man who delayed the nomination of Su-preme Court Justice nominee Merrick Garland for over 300 days without a shrug of his shoulders—give me a break. The leader delayed for 10 months when he thought it was right to do, and he can’t wait for a week to get an honest report out of the FBI? What a double standard. How galling. Accusing Democrats of needlessly de-laying a Supreme Court nomination is galling and hypocritical coming from a leader who delayed the nomination of a Supreme Court Justice for over 300 days, until his party had a chance to win the White House. So no one—no American—should accept his admon-ishments about delay. He is the master of delay. Second, he blames Democrats for these delays. As the leader well knows, Democrats are not in charge. We can’t set the calendar. These things have been delayed because people on his side of the aisle who had sincere concerns about having a fair process said they will not go forward unless the process is made fairer. Even the initial hearing where Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh testified was because a member of the Judiciary Committee on the Republican side said he didn’t want to go forward until he heard from them. It had nothing to do with Democrats. Did we agree that should happen? Of course. And so did most people who are fairminded. But it wasn’t caused by us. On the reopening of the FBI inves-tigation into these new allegations, the background check investigation, I would ask Leader M
CCONNELL , who caused that? Who caused this delay? It is not the Democrats. We don’t have the ability to do it. It was three Mem-bers on his side who sincerely were

seeking better truth because they heard two arguments, they weren’t sure which was right, and they saw that without some kind of independent investigation, it would tear the Amer-ican people apart in ways for which we will pay a price years down the road no matter what the outcome of the vote on Judge Kavanaugh. Democrats didn’t cause the delay, and he knows it. It was the inability of all of the Republicans to be unified— with justification, because the truth should be sought after in a more sin-cere way for a nomination to the high-est Court of the land. Leader M
CCONNELL has said: We are going to ‘‘plow right through’’ the re-cent allegations. Fortunately, some Members on his side of the aisle didn’t want to plow right through. They didn’t want to delay unnecessarily. One week—give me a break—compared to 10 months, leaving the Scalia seat open? Who are we kidding? Who are we kid-ding? Who is making this a political ar-gument? Let’s ask. One final point. The leader kept ac-cusing the people who came forward of engaging in political smear campaigns, of being in the mud. I want to ask the leader to answer a direct question: Does he believe or not believe Dr. Ford? Yes or no. I happen to believe her. He refuses to answer that one way or the other because he knows that Dr. Ford had tremendous credibility. In-stead, he calls her names. He uses it as Democrats—but she came forward on her own. By the way, one of the first things she did was she called the Washington Post and spoke to the reporter who later wrote the story. That was long before any Democrat knew what was going on. She felt a sincere need to come forward. To call her political—which is what, by ricochet, the leader is doing—is so unfair and is so wrong. To call all three of these women who came forward, whether or not you believe them, polit-ical actors is treating women in the same way that unfortunately too many women, as we have learned over the last few years, have been treated in the past. That doesn’t mean allegations shouldn’t be proven. That doesn’t mean there shouldn’t be a discreet, fair proc-ess to try to get to the bottom of it, which is what the FBI investigation is. That doesn’t mean all men are guilty before proven guilty. It means there deserves to be a fair hearing even if it takes 1 week—1 week compared to 10 months of delay. Finally, the investigation itself should only take a week. That is for sure. No Democrat has called for it taking more than a week. We are not moving the goalpost. But it should be thorough. It should not be limited by the Senate Judiciary staff, who was initially calling the shots, and they have been biased to begin with. When the Democratic staff asked to be on the phone with the counsel to the Presi-dent, Mr. McGahn, the Republican staff refused. That is not bipartisan. That is not fair. That is not evenhanded. Fortunately, yesterday the President said the FBI should go forward. They can interview many people in a week. When there has been a crime situation that called for it or a terrorism situa-tion that called for it, from what I un-derstand, they have interviewed hun-dreds in a week. So a list of 20 people to be interviewed in a week, when the FBI has thousands of agents, many of them well trained in the art of figuring out how to interview somebody, is not unreasonable. It is only fair. We hope there are still no limitations on the FBI investigation. We hope there are no limitations because that would jaundice the whole process, and that is not what those who called for it on either side of the aisle had asked for. We had asked for it to be full and fair and open, and then everyone would make his or her judgment. That is all people are asking for. On that issue, I once again call on President Trump and the White House to release in writing what White House Counsel Don McGahn has instructed the FBI to pursue. Until then, we have to take President Trump’s off-the-cuff comments with, perhaps, grains of salt. We have to be shown that what he said is actually being implemented. Let me read a few quotes. ‘‘The Supreme Court must never, never be viewed as a partisan institu-tion.’’ That is what Judge Kavanaugh said in his 2006 confirmation hearings. Here is one more from a speech Judge Kavanaugh gave in 2015: ‘‘First and most obviously . . . a judge cannot be a political partisan.’’ I think most Amer-icans would agree with that. I cer-tainly do. A lodestar in our consideration of ju-dicial confirmations should be whether the nominee is independent and within the ideological mainstream. The Judge Kavanaugh we saw last Thursday did not meet the standard laid out in his past statements. His prepared state-ment to the committee—prepared; if you will, malice aforethought—accused sitting U.S. Senators of a phony smear campaign, lambasted ‘‘left-wing oppo-sition groups,’’ and portrayed the re-cent allegations—the allegations of Dr. Ford, Ms. Ramirez, and the third per-son who came forward, Ms. Swetnick— as ‘‘revenge on behalf of the Clintons.’’ Frankly, Judge Kavanaugh’s testimony was better suited for FOX News than a confirmation hearing for the august U.S. Supreme Court. But that is in character with Judge Kavanaugh’s long history of working for the most par-tisan legal causes—Ken Starr, Bush v. Gore, all the myriad controversies of the Bush era. It would be one thing if Judge Kavanaugh discarded his partisan feel-ings once he donned the black robes of a jurist. Unfortunately, he has been on the bench for many years, and in Thursday’s hearing, he revealed that his bitter partisan resentments still lurk right below the surface. It should give us all pause to consider what it means to elevate such a par-tisan world view to the Supreme Court, whether it be a Democratic or Repub-lican partisan view, where rulings must be made on the legal merits, not—not— on the side of the aisle which most ben-efits. The greatest issue against Judge Kavanaugh, the one that really broth-ers most people, is his credibility. Is he telling the truth? That issue super-sedes all the others. There may be some who say: Well, what happened in high school shouldn’t count. It is many years later. People grow. People change. I think what happened to Dr. Ford— she seems credible to me—is something you can’t predict. It is not what men do. Some may say that, but we are looking at what Judge Kavanaugh said at age 53, not what he did at age 18. We are looking at his credibility now as a grown adult. If you believe Dr. Ford, then Judge Kavanaugh is not telling the truth. If this were the only instance, it would be one thing. That is bad enough, but there are many more. Over and over again, it is hard to believe what Judge Kavanaugh swore under oath at the committee hearing. Just yesterday, NBC News reported that either Judge Kavanaugh or people close to the judge were in communica-tion with his Yale classmates to get them to rebut allegations by Deborah Ramirez, later published in the New Yorker. Beyond the unseemliness of a Federal judge pressuring former classmates to support his nomination, it seems that Judge Kavanaugh was at least very misleading to the Judiciary Committee about Ms. Ramirez’s story. When asked by Senator H
ATCH when he first heard of Ramirez’s allegations, he answered ‘‘in the New Yorker story.’’ That is when he first heard. Based on the NBC reports, if they are correct, that was not truthful. It would be one thing if that were one isolated incident, but, again, there are far too many misstatements, far too many inaccuracies, far too many mischaracterizations. He pled igno-rance to many Bush-era controversies, only for emails to be released showing he was aware of them all and played a role in many. He offered explanations for high school yearbook quotes. And it is not the quotes themselves or what they indicated; it is that his expla-nations sort of defy belief. And, of course, based on the accounts by his high school and college classmates, he has grossly mischaracterized his rela-tionship with alcohol. The common thread is that Judge Kavanaugh repeatedly tiptoes around the truth. He doesn’t tell the truth in many instances, it seems, to paint his nomination in a favorable light. We want a Supreme Court nominee, whatever their politics and whatever their party origins, to be a shining ex-ample of someone who tells the truth

without doubt and without equivo-cation. If you say ‘‘Well, maybe he is telling the truth, and maybe he is not,’’ then he doesn’t belong on the Su-preme Court, and I think most Ameri-cans are saying that. Again, even if you want to discount— as some people do—what happened when he was 15 in high school and 18 in college, you cannot discount what he is saying and professing at age 53 when it flies in the face of being truthful. That is the key question here. There is demeanor. He sure didn’t show the demeanor of a judge at the hearing. There is partisanship. He brought out the most raw form of par-tisanship, so unbecoming of someone on the appeals court, let alone the Su-preme Court, and he did not show any semblance to always being 100 percent honest and truthful, which is what we need in a Supreme Court Justice. So, again, even if you feel that what happened when he was 15 and 18 shouldn’t matter, what happens when he is 53 does matter, and his credibility is in real doubt—doubt enough, I think, for most Americans to say that this man does not belong on the Supreme Court, and there ought to be some-body—many people—who would be a whole lot better. I yield the floor. Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, what is the business before the Senate? The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are on the motion to concur with respect to the FAA. Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous con-sent to speak as in morning business. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. 
NOMINATION OF BRETT KAVANAUGH  
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I have been in politics for a long time, but I have never seen anything like what I witnessed when I went back to Chicago last Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. From the minute the plane landed at Midway Airport in Chicago through the entire weekend, every-one—everyone—was engaged. People were coming up to me—total strang-ers—expressing themselves about the hearing that had just been completed with Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh. I was stunned, and I have done this for a long time. There was the doorman in the rain holding an umbrella at the hotel talking about what he heard and what he remembered from the hearing. The taxicab driver, the person on the street—everyone wanted to speak to me about this. It has been estimated that 6 out of 10 Americans listened or watched the hearing last week. I am not at all sur-prised. The response I found on the street and in the neighborhoods and in meetings around my State of Illinois and in the city of Chicago certainly gave evidence to that. It was an interesting response, too, primarily from women but not exclu-sively—women who came up to me, and I could tell by the look in their eyes and the tone of their voice that some-thing had just happened publicly in America that touched them personally. Some would confide in me and whisper about a personal experience they had. Others would look into my eyes, and I realized this meant a lot to them for reasons they didn’t want to share. That hearing last week was a mo-ment I have never seen before in Amer-ican politics in the time I have been around. The second thing I noted was the comments about Dr. Ford. Except for a still photograph, I had never seen her before she walked into the committee room last week to testify under oath. I didn’t know what to expect as she sat down, after taking the oath, and began her testimony. Time and again the people who worked with her described her condi-tion as fragile. In her own words during the course of her testimony, she said she was terrified—terrified. And why wouldn’t she be—at this point in her life, to become a national person, a na-tional profile, a national celebrity; to see her experience turn her family life upside down to the point where she was forced to move out of her home and she and her family had to take refuge and safety in a secure location. There was all of the attention that was being paid to her, some with praise and some with criticism. It is the kind of thing that even politicians are supposed to get used to and never do. So imagine that scenario for an ordinary person. I listened to her testimony, and I heard what she had to say about why this event took place. I realized that this woman from California believed she had what she called a civic duty to come forward before the White House made its final decision on the choice of a Supreme Court nominee because she believed she had important informa-tion about Brett Kavanaugh that the President should know and that Con-gress should know, and she didn’t know where to turn. For those who argue that she was part of some political conspiracy, she didn’t know which way to turn. She ended up turning to the place most would, to her local Congresswoman, A
NNAESHOO , and sitting down with her in California and talking about this confidential letter that she wanted to put in the hands of somebody who would make a decision about the future of the Supreme Court. It was a per-fectly reasonable explanation of what an ordinary citizen would do, and that is what she did. When she finally got in contact with the Senate Judiciary Committee with this same confidential letter and had communications with Senator F
EIN-
STEIN , she stressed over and over that she wanted this to remain confidential and that she didn’t want her identity to be disclosed for fear of what it would mean to her and her family—a natural human reaction. I want to say a word about Senator F
EINSTEIN . You may quibble, you may debate, you may argue with the way she handled this, but I think she did what she thought was right for the very right reasons. She believed that she had an obligation to Dr. Ford—an obligation to protect her identity. I know Senator FEINSTEIN . She is a per-son of character and values and prin-ciples. I have been saddened and, in fact, angry at times when my col-leagues from the other side of the aisle accused her of so many things—of plot-ting some political conspiracy to bring down this nominee. In fact, two of them suggested she was the one who leaked the letter to the press. I am as certain as I stand here, after years of working with her, that neither of those things are even close to the truth. She was trying to do what she felt was the right thing—first, for this woman, this mother, this resident of her home State, and, second, for this country. I don’t question in any way whatsoever— and no one should—her efforts and good faith to serve this Nation in a very difficult process. But Dr. Ford came forward and told her story. I asked her a question point- blank: ‘‘We are now being told that perhaps you were mistaken. Perhaps it wasn’t Brett Kavanaugh who assaulted you in that bedroom in the Maryland suburbs. I wanted to ask you: With what degree of certainty do you believe that Brett Kavanaugh was the assail-ant?’’ Her answer to me was very short and direct: ‘‘100 percent.’’ She was 100 per-cent certain. You think to yourself: It happened 36 years ago. How could she be so certain? It was so long ago, but then you realize that, at that moment, it impacted her life in a way that few people ever want to experience. For 36 years she has been carrying the memory of that party, that bedroom, that assault in her life, to the point where she sought therapy—couples therapy with her hus-band—and told her therapist, as well as her husband, the name of the assailant 6 years ago, long before Judge Kavanaugh was proposed as a nominee for the Supreme Court. I came away with strong feelings about Dr. Ford—her credibility, her composure, the fact that she was reso-lute, and the fact that she showed a de-gree of character that is extraordinary under the circumstances. I believe Dr. Ford, and I believe what she told us. That is why I am troubled to hear Republican Senators come to the floor today and say: Well, you know, we feel that she was mistreated. Some of the same Senators, including the majority leader, have said that. They came to the floor on 3 successive days last week and dismissed her complaint as a smear. That is the word that was used—‘‘smear’’—on the floor of the Senate. Even before she had testified, even before they had seen her under oath say what she did, they dismissed this as a smear. I don’t think that is an indication of respect for Dr. Ford to have said that on the floor of the Sen-ate, and I think that she deserves

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6421 October 2, 2018 
more, as anyone would, who is willing to testify under oath. I would also say that the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh last week was a revelation. He stayed with his story that he was mischaracterized and was improperly and wrongly accused, and he, too, was certain that this event had never occurred, but in his testimony, in his opening statement last week be-fore our Judiciary Committee, I saw something that I had never seen before in the Senate. I saw a level of emotion, which was understandable, considering the accusations that had been made, but there was a level of anger that I have seldom seen, and perhaps have never seen, in the Senate. Judge Kavanaugh attacked those who had raised these questions about him. He said that he bore no ill will to-ward Dr. Ford, but then he called her allegations ‘‘a calculated and orches-trated political hit,’’ citing ‘‘apparent pent-up anger about President Trump and the 2016 election,’’ and then he added: ‘‘revenge on behalf of the Clin-tons.’’ It is hard to imagine that a person aspiring to serve on the highest Court of the land—where your temperament is so important, where you have to make certain, as best you can, that you take politics out of your legal equation—would be so direct and so specific in blaming his plight on ‘‘re-venge on behalf of the Clintons.’’ This political grace note from Brett Kavanaugh—this ‘‘lock her up’’ grace note—may be appealing to some on the political spectrum, but it speaks vol-umes about this judge and how he would serve if he ever had an oppor-tunity to be on the Supreme Court. It has been said over and over by the Republican majority leader that the Democrats are in the midst of a big delay tactic. I have to echo the com-ments of Senator S
CHUMER earlier. It is very difficult to take the Senate ma-jority leader credibly when he makes a statement that we are trying to delay filling a vacancy on the Supreme Court. The Senate majority leader set the record in delaying Merrick Gar-land’s nomination for more than 300 days when he even refused to meet with the man, let alone consider a hearing, when Judge Garland was nom-inated by President Obama. To have this majority leader now tell us that we are the ones responsible for delay-ing really is to ignore history and to ignore the reality of what has occurred here, because of the courage of his Members, three of whom have stepped up and said: We will not dismiss Dr. Ford’s allegations with just a staff phone call; we want an actual hearing. That was inspired by three Republican Members of the Senate, and we backed them up. We thought their request was right. As for this FBI investigation, I know a little bit about that because I asked Judge Kavanaugh directly during the course of this hearing what he wanted us to do. I did not ask him what the White House wanted us to do and not what the Senate Judiciary Committee Republican leadership wanted to do, but what he, Judge Kavanaugh, wanted to do when it came to this FBI inves-tigation. My point was, if Dr. Ford is willing to submit her allegations to an FBI review, why wouldn’t you, Judge Kavanaugh? If you believe there are no credible witnesses and no credible evi-dence, otherwise, why wouldn’t you want a complete investigation done by the nonpartisan professionals at the FBI? But even then, he refused that thought of an FBI investigation. It wasn’t until Senator JEFFFLAKE , a Republican of Arizona, made it clear that he would not move forward on a vote on the floor without that FBI in-vestigation, joined by Senator C
OONS of Delaware and many others, that this FBI investigation was under way. So give credit where it is due. Any delay of a week for us to consider this is real-ly inspired by Senator F
LAKE ’s request, with the support on the Democratic side of the aisle. So to blame us for this delay, unfortunately, again, is not ac-curate. It appears now that Senator M
CCON-
NELL , the Republican majority leader, is determined to plow through this, as he has said. He has said this nomina-tion will be on this floor this week. If the FBI investigation is completed Thursday or Friday, there will be a re-port that is available for Senators to review, as they should, and to read the results of this investigation and draw their own conclusions. That is the reg-ular process of the Senate, but it ap-pears that Senator M
CCONNELL can’t wait. He can’t wait for that to be com-pleted and thoughtfully considered by his colleagues in the Senate. It has to be this week, he has deter-mined, and has said it over and over again. He blames us for delay, delay, delay. If we take a day or two or more to thoughtfully consider whatever the FBI finds, isn’t that our constitutional responsibility filling a vacancy, a life-time appointment, to the highest Court in the land? That, I think, is my re-sponsibility and should be his as well. Let me close by saying, this has been a celebrated chapter in history and will be remembered. To have a Supreme Court nomination for the swing vote of the Court that may tip the balance for decades before us is something we obvi-ously consider seriously. That it would come at a moment when these allega-tions have been made about sexual har-assment as we are facing this issue at every level and every sector of Amer-ican culture really dramatizes the im-portance that we get this right; most importantly, that we be fair—fair both to Dr. Ford, who had the courage to step forward, and fair to Judge Kavanaugh, who has the right to tell us his memory of events and to be taken seriously as well. The FBI investiga-tion, though it was resisted by Judge Kavanaugh, is a step in the right direc-tion. I hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who have not declared where they are and how they will vote on the Kavanaugh nomination will wait until the FBI investigation is complete, review their findings, and re-flect on the very basic question: Is Brett Kavanaugh the right person at this moment in history to be given a lifetime appointment to the highest Court in the land? I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. KYL). The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. 
USMCA  
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I was greatly encouraged to hear yesterday’s announcement by the administration that the United States, Mexico, and Canada have now successfully come to a trilateral agreement to modernize NAFTA. As the Presiding Officer knows, this is important not only to border States like ours; this is important to the en-tire country. About 5 million jobs in the United States depend on binational trade with Mexico, and about 8 million depend on binational trade with Can-ada. So this is really important to our country and, I think, will hopefully calm a lot of anxiety over some of the various trade disputes that we have had recently. Based on the deal reached Sunday, Canada will now join a pact with the United States and Mexico agreed to in August. The newly named United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement will greatly benefit North American com-merce and modernize areas where our economy has evolved since the 1990s. When we think about what life was like back in the 1990s, digital com-merce was unheard of; oil and gas ex-ploration using modern techniques like fracking and horizontal drilling, which have produced the shale energy revolu-tion in the United States, didn’t exist back then; and, of course, as many of my friends in the energy business tell me, the shale we produce oil and gas from in the United States doesn’t stop at the Rio Grande. Mexico has opened up its economy, greatly allowing foreign investment and embracing some of these modern techniques, which will, I think, have a revolutionary impact on Mexico and its economy. My guiding mantra over the last year for these negotiations has been what is known as the Hippocratic Oath that doctors take: First, do no harm. That is what Ambassador Lighthizer and Wilbur Ross, the Sec-retary of Commerce, told the Finance Committee when they were confirmed. I argue that we have to fix NAFTA to be sure because after 24 years, parts of it are outdated, as I said, but not nix it entirely. Although, we are still review-ing the fine print of the agreement, I

think we should be proud of what has been accomplished. Since last August, Ambassador Lighthizer and his team at USTR, the U.S. Trade Representative, have nego-tiated for countless hours with our southern and northern neighbors. The road to an updated agreement has not been easy, but I believe those efforts will pay off, and soon the responsibility will be ours in the Senate to vote on this agreement. It will be a few months off, to be sure, but we will have a role in voting on the agreement. As President Trump said, the new agreement will fix deficiencies in the original NAFTA, reduce trade barriers and open markets for U.S. farmers and manufacturers. I am particularly hear-ing a lot from my folks in the agri-culture sector in Texas that they are excited with some of the negotiations with Canada with regard to agri-culture. It modernizes rules for dairy and auto and financial services, as well as many others. The agriculture sector that I think was most concerned about some of these negotiations is breathing a giant sigh of relief. This is a significant development in our trade policy and a great testament to the productive diplomacy the ad-ministration has been engaged in since day one. Sometimes it may seem a lit-tle bit like a bull in a China shop, but when you produce good results, maybe that is worth it. Promises were made to update NAFTA, of course, as long as our neighbors collaborated in good faith, and those promises now appear to have been kept. As I have said, millions of Americans’ jobs are supported by trade with Mexico and Canada. In Texas, NAFTA has been one of the cornerstones of our economy, which helped cause us to create more jobs than any other State in the country in recent years. We have the second larg-est State economy in the United States, so Mexico, being our top import and export partner, obviously, has im-plications that are big not only to us but truly national and, I believe, inter-national in scope. Over the course of the last quarter century since NAFTA was signed, we have reaped benefits in terms of jobs, income, and cultural exchange. These benefits are so significant and wide-spread that they can’t be fully meas-ured. They are arguably why Texas has had more at stake than our 49 counter-parts throughout the NAFTA reform process. This new, enhanced agreement is a positive step. I thank Ambassador Lighthizer, as well as President Trump and all of our U.S., Canadian, and Mexican officials who were involved in crafting this document. I look forward to working with the chairman of the Finance Committee and all of our members on the Finance Committee, as well as the entire Senate, moving forward as we consider congressional implementation of this agreement. NOMINATION OF BRETT KAVANAUGH  
Mr. President, I wish to turn briefly to the ongoing confirmation process of Judge Kavanaugh for the U.S. Supreme Court. I have already said publicly on more than one occasion that this is a dark day; this is a dark period for the U.S. Senate. Never before have we seen a nominee to the Supreme Court or any court treated so badly, although we do know that starting with Robert Bork’s confirmation hearing, the gloves came off, and these confirmation processes became, unfortunately, all too ugly. As we know now, there has been a supplemental background investiga-tion ordered by the FBI on allegations that were sprung on Judge Kavanaugh on the eve of his confirmation. There was never a whiff of these allegations during Judge Kavanaugh’s six previous background investigations by the FBI and by the Judiciary Committee and other committees. I think it is telling that the aiders and abettors of this last-minute ambush include political operatives masquerading as disin-terested lawyers with only their cli-ent’s best wishes at heart. This past Sunday, we heard from Ra-chel Mitchell, an investigative counsel from Arizona, who interviewed both Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh at last week’s hearing. I appreciate the profes-sionalism with which she approached this job. It was not one that many would have sought because she knew, and we all knew, she would be thrust into the vortex of this huge national debate and the circuslike atmosphere that, unfortunately, the Judiciary Committee had become. Yet she did do a public service. She was not pressured in any way to present her own analysis following the hearing, but she chose to do so. What she said, based on her expe-rience as a sex crimes prosecutor, somebody who routinely deals with vic-tims of sexual abuse and sexual as-sault—she has developed a lot of exper-tise and wisdom when it comes to ap-proaching these kinds of cases. I think we were the beneficiaries, the country was the beneficiary, of her expertise and knowledge in the way she con-ducted her careful but respectful inter-rogation of Dr. Ford. Her analysis contains crucial points that the FBI’s background investiga-tion may flesh out this week even fur-ther. First, she said this was not a case of he said, she said; this was a case of she said, they said. In other words, every witness alleged to have been present at the time Dr. Ford alleged that Judge Kavanaugh, when he was 17 years old, physically assaulted her said that they have no memory of such an event or knowledge of such an event. In one case, Dr. Ford’s close friend, Le-land Keyser, said that she doesn’t even remember ever meeting Brett Kavanaugh. Similarly, Patrick Smyth and Mark Judge—two other alleged witnesses Dr. Ford named—said the event never happened. This is not just a case where there is an allegation and no corroboration; this is a case of an allegation and negative corroboration. I mentioned Dr. Ford’s lawyers ear-lier, and I want to return to that in just a moment. Some of their actions suggest they were more interested in using Dr. Ford for partisan purposes than ensuring her story was properly considered alongside other information during the standard committee proc-ess. We all remember when Dr. Ford’s hearing was delayed, the committee was informed by her lawyers that Dr. Ford’s trauma prevented her from fly-ing because she experienced claus-trophobia. Then, during her testimony, watched by as many as 20 million peo-ple in this country, Dr. Ford said she flies frequently for hobbies and work. One has to wonder, why was this delay orchestrated? Was it a stunt concocted by her lawyers to buy more time? You have to wonder. The truth is, her lawyers were in-volved long before that point. When the ranking member of the Judiciary Com-mittee, our colleague from California, met with Judge Kavanaugh one-on-one on August 20, she already knew about the allegation, which was dated July 30. On August 20, she met with Judge Kavanaugh. She had in her files an al-legation dated July 30 that she shared with no one, and she didn’t discuss it with Judge Kavanaugh during their private meeting. Instead, the ranking member recommended that Dr. Ford engage highly partisan operatives to represent her instead of referring the allegations to the FBI. In other words, why would you take an allegation of sexual assault and keep it in your file and recommend the complainant contact politically active Democratic lawyers? Wouldn’t it make sense to provide the allegation to the FBI right away so that the FBI could conduct whatever investigation it saw fit? Unfortunately, she neither pre-sented that to the FBI on a timely basis, nor did she give Judge Kavanaugh a chance to refute it when she had plenty of opportunity to do so when he met with her in her office. We know the lawyers who have been representing Dr. Ford have played an active role since early August. They were already engaged when Judge Kavanaugh sat through his initial weeklong confirmation hearing. By that point, the lawyers had already in-sisted that Dr. Ford take a polygraph, although they will not share with the Senate Judiciary Committee or with anybody else the underlying questions and interview. All they shared with us is the conclusion of the polygrapher. Yet none of this—the lawyers, the alle-gations, the steps being taken—were shared with the Senate Judiciary Com-mittee, which was initially assigned the responsibility of vetting the nomi-nee through an extensive background investigation and, obviously, through the 1,200-some written questions for the record and the hours upon hours of hearings that everybody in the country could witness. None of this came up at that first hearing, not even behind closed doors,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6423 October 2, 2018 
which is the procedure by which sen-sitive personal matters are presented to the nominee if Senators on the Judi-ciary Committee have questions. What we actually try to do in the Senate is not to embarrass or harass or terrorize either the nominee or the witnesses who might have information relevant to the confirmation. We actually have a careful, respectful, and confidential process by which that information can first be supplied to the Judiciary Com-mittee behind closed doors. That could and should have been the process used in this case, but it wasn’t. Here we are a few weeks later. We have had another hearing, at Dr. Ford’s request, in which she shared her story to the best of her ability. I am actually glad she testified. That was her desire, although I believe she did not have to be put through the wringer the Senate Judiciary Committee has put her through. But that has not been our fault so much as it has been the fault of this orchestrated effort. It is not fair to Judge Kavanaugh, I believe, to string this matter along fur-ther. It is not fair to his family, either, or to the many women who have stood with him every step of the way. This process has taken a toll on all of them and all of us. Now that the FBI is doing a supple-mental background investigation, which will conclude hopefully in the next few days, the allegation has been, well, the judge was so angry at the hearing defending his honor and good name against these allegations that this shows a lack of judicial tempera-ment. If you were accused falsely of com-mitting a crime, wouldn’t you be angry too? Wouldn’t you want to clear your good name? That is exactly what Judge Kavanaugh did. I think it was a mov-ing, emotional defense of his good name and character. Our friends who are now making this accusation that somehow this dem-onstrates his lack of judicial tempera-ment are ignoring his 12 years on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, the fact the American Bar Association’s Stand-ing Committee that reviews these judi-cial nominees has found him unani-mously ‘‘well qualified,’’ based in part on his good character and tempera-ment. This is a red herring. You can’t accuse somebody of a crime and expect them to sit there and take it. That is illogical, unreasonable. Now the argument, too, is this: We really have the judge now; we have him. We caught him in some discrep-ancies—based on what? Based on his high school yearbook. Man, this has been quite an investigation if we are going back into somebody’s high school yearbook and asking them to decipher things that would be, I think the judge said, cringeworthy that adolescent boys and adolescents do in their high school yearbook. I guess this should be a lesson for all of our pages and others who are still in high school that if you have the oppor-tunity to ascend to the highest Court in the land or other important respon-sibility, the U.S. Senate is going to go back and scour your high school year-book and ask you about entries made not by you but by others in your year-book. This has become a national embar-rassment. I said at the hearing that it reminded me of what I read about the McCarthy hearings. Joseph McCarthy, Senator from Wisconsin was riding high upon the concerns the American people had about communists in gov-ernment. He went too far, and at one point he was called down, ultimately left the Senate—was expelled from the Senate or resigned from the Senate; I can’t remember which. He was asked by one of the lawyers who was rep-resenting a young man who was being interrogated who finally asked Senator McCarthy: I have had yet to gauge the depth of your cruelty and your reck-lessness. At long last, sir, have you no decency? I recited those lines at the hearing for Judge Kavanaugh because I think, indeed, this whole process has been un-fair to Dr. Ford, to Judge Kavanaugh. It has been cruel to the judge’s family, and it has been reckless in the ex-treme. I think it has been an embar-rassment. I think it is a stain on the reputation and the standing of the U.S. Senate. So as the supplemental FBI inves-tigation wraps up, let’s be mindful of what our colleagues across the aisle have said they expected from this sup-plemental background investigation because they, too, understood we were approaching the end of this process. For example, the senior Senator from Minnesota said: ‘‘Let’s give this one week.’’ She said that last Friday. She indicated her support for the investiga-tion, even saying that we are all in a better spot now than we were before. Well, I hope that is still her position. We had our colleagues across the aisle agree to both the timeline and the validity of this last step in Judge Kavanaugh’s confirmation. The junior Senator from Delaware, during the hearing, called for the same amount of time, just 1 more week. In a television interview, the junior Senator from Ha-waii said that 7 days is enough time to ‘‘get to the bottom’’ of these allega-tions. So I hope our colleagues will re-member their own words and their own statements, even though, as we all know, no supplemental information will change their vote. This is, to me, the irony of where we find ourselves. I think it was Judge Kavanaugh who said a fair process starts with an open mind and then lis-tening to both sides, but Judge Kavanaugh doesn’t have a judge or jury in this confirmation process who has an open mind. All of the Senate Demo-crats on the Judiciary Committee have said they unequivocally oppose his con-firmation. So what do they expect this additional supplemental investigation to disclose that might possibly per-suade them they were wrong? Well, it is not about a search for the truth. This is about search and destroy. I have said this is what I hate most about Washington, DC—the political environment in which we find our-selves. It is not just about winning an argument. It is not just about winning an election or winning a vote in the Congress. It is about the politics of per-sonal destruction. That is what we are seeing here. It is an orchestrated effort from start to finish. That is why I think this is such an embarrassment to the Senate. If we somehow decide that people can be essentially convicted of a crime based on an allegation with no evidence, what does that say about our commitment to the Constitution itself, the due process of law, and the pre-sumption of guilt? I know our colleagues will say: Well, this is a job interview. This is not just a job interview. This isn’t just even about Judge Kavanaugh and his con-firmation process. This is about us. This is about our national commitment to the Constitution, one that guaran-tees your liberty unless the govern-ment can come in and prove a case against you, where you have a chance to confront the witnesses against you, where you enjoy a presumption of inno-cence. This is no longer a job inter-view. This is no longer even just about Judge Kavanaugh. A vote against Judge Kavanaugh im-plies that he is guilty not only of teen-age misconduct but guilty of perjury now. That is what a vote against Judge Kavanaugh implies. A vote against Judge Kavanaugh is a ‘‘yes’’ vote for more search-and-destroy efforts against public servants and judicial nominees and more ambushing nomi-nees after crucial information is with-held for weeks at a time. We all know how the Senate oper-ates. It operates on the basis of prece-dent. Once something has been done, it is precedent for what will be done in the future. If this is the new precedent for the U.S. Senate, woe be to us. A vote against Kavanaugh is a ‘‘yes’’ vote for more of these despicable tac-tics being used time and time again in the future—coat hangers being sent to the offices of some our colleagues, fundraising bribes being offered, mobs attacking Senators and their families at restaurants. The American people deserve a final and definitive resolution to this proc-ess. Judge Kavanaugh deserves the same, as does the Supreme Court. This week after the supplemental back-ground investigation of the FBI con-cludes, there will be a vote. I trust that Judge Kavanaugh will then finally be confirmed. Then, hopefully, the Senate will come to its senses and realize how wrong, how embarrassing, and how dis-graceful this process has been not only to Dr. Ford but to Judge Kavanaugh as well. I hope and pray we will come to our senses. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.

The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. 
LAS VEGAS MASS SHOOTING  
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, Candice Bowers overcame a lot of chal-lenges in her life. She raised two chil-dren as a single mother. She worked as a waitress at Mimi’s Cafe. She had a wide circle of friends. She adopted a little girl named Ariel, who was a rel-ative’s baby who couldn’t be cared for. Ariel was 2 years old, and her children were 16 and 20, a year ago yesterday, when Candice Bowers was one of the over 50 victims of the biggest mass shooting in American history—in Las Vegas. In speaking about Candice, her aunt said that everybody loved her and that she always had a smile on her face. She would help anybody. She had a big heart. She was just a sweetheart. Rob-ert Layaco, a 78-year-old veteran who served in the Korean war, who was her grandfather, said that everybody else might forget about this in 6 months but that they will never forget about her—he won’t, her daughter won’t, her little daughter won’t, and her son will not forget about her—in thinking ahead to all the Thanksgivings and Christmases at which there will be an empty seat at their dinner table. He said thoughts and prayers are just not going to do it. Angela Gomez was 20 years old when she was gunned down at the concert a year ago yesterday. She had graduated from Riverside Polytechnic High School in 2015 and was attending class-es at a community college. Her former cheer coach said that Angie was a fun- loving, sweet, young lady with a great sense of humor and that she challenged herself all the time. Angie enrolled in advanced placement classes, and she loved the stage. She was involved in cheer, she was involved in choir, and she was involved in the Riverside Chil-dren’s Theatre. She had an amazing life ahead of her—filled with joy, filled with enthusiasm for performance. Charleston Hartfield was 34 years old when he was killed in the shooting in Las Vegas. He was a Las Vegas police officer. He was off duty when he de-cided to attend the Route 91 Harvest Music Festival, and that is when this shooting took place. One of his friends said: 
I don’t know a better man than Charles. They say it’s always the good ones we lose early. There’s no truer statement than that with Charles. 
Charles enlisted in the Army in 2000, and he was a paratrooper with the 82nd Airborne Division. He deployed to Iraq in 2003, and he served in a task force that was awarded a Presidential Unit Citation for extraordinary heroism. He survived his deployment to Iraq—one of the most dangerous theaters of com-bat in modern history. Yet he couldn’t survive going to a concert to hear a singer he liked in his hometown of Las Vegas. GUN VIOLENCE  
Mr. President, I come to the floor every week or so—a little bit less fre-quently now than I did a few years ago—to talk about who these people were. I think the statistics have kind of come to wash over people. There is no other country in the world—at least in the advanced world, in the industri-alized world—that has numbers like these: 33,000 a year dying from guns, 2,800 a month, 93 a day. These are epi-demic level numbers, and there are lots of different stories inside these num-bers. The majority of these are sui-cides. We have an epidemic level of sui-cides alone in this country that is going nowhere but up. A lot of these are homicides. A lot of these are acci-dental shootings. They are domestic vi-olence crimes. Suffice it to say, it only happens in the United States, and it is getting worse, not better. Certainly, I can show you a 200-year trajectory of how violence in the United States is getting better, but in the last several years, since these mass shootings have become so regularized, all of it is getting worse. There seems to be a lot of consensus about at least one very narrow-cast idea to try to re-duce the likelihood that 58 people could die all at one time, as happened in Las Vegas. As we came out of that shooting a year ago, it seemed that we all, at the very least, agreed that these things called bump stocks—these things that are manufactured to turn a semiauto-matic weapon essentially into an auto-matic weapon with which you can fire multiple rounds with one pull of the trigger—shouldn’t be legal, that they shouldn’t be allowed to be sold. We had all made a decision a long time ago that notwithstanding our differences as to whether these semiautomatic, tac-tical weapons should be sold in the commercial space, we at least knew that automatic weapons should not be available to consumers. Now this modi-fication was being allowed to turn semiautomatic weapons into auto-matic weapons. We are now a year since the Las Vegas mass shooting, and you can still get one of these. You can still turn a semiautomatic weapon into an auto-matic weapon with ease. In fact, bump stock manufacturers don’t need a Fed-eral firearms license to sell them—you don’t even need a license to sell these things—because the Federal Govern-ment classifies them as accessories, not as firearms. To me, it is just unbelievable that our ability to work on the issue of gun violence has broken down so badly that even on an issue about which we pro-fess agreement a year after 58 people were killed—and by the way, 800 people injured—we still haven’t done anything in this Congress about the narrow issue of bump stocks, which turn a semiauto-matic weapon essentially into an auto-matic weapon. In February of this year, President Trump directed the Department of Jus-tice to propose a rule that would do this. Just last week, the Department of Justice announced that it was submit-ting its rule to the Office of Manage-ment and Budget—one of the final steps in the rulemaking process. Yet, as we all know, that rulemaking proc-ess takes a long time. You are talking about a rule that will not be effective until at least 2019. Even when that rule is put into place, it will be easily con-tested in the courts because we all know that it is doubtful as to whether the administration has the ability to ban bump stocks given the nature of the underlying law. It would be so much easier for us to just pass a law that says bump stocks are illegal, thus taking the question away from the courts as to whether the administration has the power to do it. We could also do it much more quickly because this rule is still going to take months and months and months before it is fully put into effect, putting more and more people in this country at risk. I wear my frustration on my sleeve when it comes to the issue of gun vio-lence because I just don’t understand why there is only one issue like this about which the American public has made up its mind. The polling tells us that universal background checks enjoy 97-percent support in this coun-try. By a 2-to-1 margin, people want these assault weapons off the street. The ban of bump stocks enjoys ratings similar to that of universal background checks. Yet we still can’t get it done, and there are consequences. If you look back over the history of this country, we have always been a more violent nation than our parent nations in Europe from which a lot of the original settlers came. Yet we are more violent now by a factor of 5 or 6 or in some cases by a factor of 20 be-cause the vast majority of our violence in this country today is done by guns. The data tells you that in places in the United States that have invested in the kinds of reforms that we would like to take nationally, like universal back-ground checks or the bans on certain dangerous capacity weapons, the vio-lence rates are much lower and gun deaths are much lower. So it is not a guessing game as to what works here if you actually want to reduce the num-ber of people who are killed by guns. Ultimately, we know what works. One of my chief frustrations con-tinues to be the fact that we pay atten-tion to the issue of gun violence only when 50 people are killed or when it is the 1-year mark of 50 people being killed. This is a daily number. Every day, 93 people are being killed by guns, and they do not make it on the evening talk shows. They don’t make headlines, but the pain for those 93 families today who will lose a loved one from a suicide or a homicide or an accidental shooting is no different from the pain that comes from losing a brother or a sister

or a son or a daughter in Parkland or Las Vegas or in Newtown. Betty Sandoval had a toxic relation-ship with a man who had been threat-ening her for some time. There were text messages found on her phone, threatening her life if she ever left her boyfriend. One day, she was followed home by this young man, who shot and killed her out of anger that their rela-tionship was going the wrong way. Betty was 16 years old and was shot in a fit of passion by a young man who had easy access to a weapon with which to try to exercise his demons over the relationship. This is the story of America. We don’t have more mental illness than any other country in the world. We don’t have more broken relationships than other country in the world. We just have more guns. So when a young man is really upset about how things are going with his 16-year-old girlfriend, he can easily find a weapon. That is the story of suicides as well. There are tons of data that show that if you don’t have easy access to a gun in those moments when you are con-templating taking your own life, you have a chance to survive that moment, to get help, to have a conversation with your mother or your father or a friend, and that gets you to a different place. It is the proximity of that weap-on that makes a difference, as it did for Betty Sandoval, who died just about 3 weeks ago in Houston, TX. Dezmen Jones was 15 years old and Jameel Robert Murray was 28 years old when they were both shot to death in York, PA. Of Jameel Murray, one of his mother’s friends said that he was al-ways smiling. She said: ‘‘He was just larger than life.’’ Classmates of Dezmen Jones said that he was ‘‘a really cool person’’ who ‘‘had lots of friends.’’ Dezmen was 15 years old, and he rode his bike all around town, from friend to friend, back and forth to William Penn Senior High School. He was 15 years old when he was gunned down. Jameel’s mother’s friend set up a fundraiser on Facebook because Jameel’s family didn’t have enough money to bury him. They didn’t have enough money to do a funeral, so they asked for donations online so that they could give Jameel, who was 28 years old, a proper burial. That shooting hap-pened a week ago, on September 26. Close to home, in Waterbury, CT, on September 2, Matthew Diaz was shot in the back early Sunday morning in the Berkley Heights housing complex. This is about 3 miles from our house in Con-necticut. He was the father of two. He had an 11-year-old son and a 2-year-old daughter. Imagine having to tell an 11- year-old kid: Your dad is gone, and he is never coming back. Matthew’s mother said: 
He loved his children to the fullest. He would do anything for his children. He would do anything for me. He was my friend, my protector, my comedian. 
Diaz was unconscious when the police found him. They tried to perform CPR, but he was pronounced dead about an hour after arriving at the hospital. Every single one of these stories is exceptional because when an 11-year- old loses a dad or when you lose your mom or when a newly adopted 2-year- old no longer has her adoptive mother, everything changes. Everything is cat-aclysmically different for those fami-lies. There are 93 of those stories every single day, and it doesn’t have to be that way. It is not inevitable. It is within our control. I think these numbers just tend to stun people after a while. I think these numbers don’t mean anything to folks. So I am going to continue to come to the floor and tell the stories of these victims, to give voices to these vic-tims, especially today as we mark 1 year since the worst mass shooting in the history of the country. We recog-nize 1 full year since we pledged to do something about it, since we talked about the narrow area of agreement around bump stocks, 1 full year of total inaction on the one thing we thought— we thought—we could do together to make the country a safer place. Thank you. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. CRUZ). The Senator from Pennsylvania. Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. 
NOMINATION OF BRETT KAVANAUGH  
Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I come to floor, once again, to raise concerns about the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. I think these concerns permeate every aspect of the nomination process and the nominee himself. When Judge Kavanaugh’s name came forward because of the nomination by President Trump, he came from a list of 25 names. These names were assem-bled by the White House in consulta-tion with—the record indicates—just two groups: the Heritage Foundation and the Federalist Society. Both are far-right organizations that have a view of public policy that on most issues I don’t agree with, but I think that is true of most Pennsylvanians. I can’t speak for the whole country, but I would be willing to guess many peo-ple around the country are not in agreement. The Heritage Foundation, for exam-ple, has called labor unions cartels. That is one view they seem to have about labor unions. I come from a State where we have a proud labor history, where people lit-erally bled and died for the right to or-ganize, whether it was the Homestead strike in Southwestern Pennsylvania back at the turn of the previous cen-tury or whether it was the Lattimer massacre in Northeastern Pennsyl-vania or whether it was the strike by anthracite miners in the early 1900s in my home area, the region where I live in Northeastern Pennsylvania. These fights for the right to organize, the right to bargain collectively for wages and benefits were not just hard-won, but they represented the values of the people of Pennsylvania. When I consider that history and consider the attacks that organized labor is currently undergoing—the Janus case by this Supreme Court is one example and I am afraid will be one in a series of cases that will be de-cided against the interests of working men and women—I am especially con-cerned about any nomination to the Supreme Court on those and other issues but, maybe, especially the nomi-nation of Judge Kavanaugh. I think even someone who would dis-agree with me on my views of orga-nized labor or my views on his record would agree that it is highly unlikely, if not impossible, that we would have an American middle class without or-ganized labor, without all of that work, all of the sacrifice that was undertaken to achieve the right to organize. That right is threatened now, and I think this nomination is one of the threats to that basic right. It should come as no surprise that this nominee has sprung from that same process that I mentioned earlier. I believe this list that has now been put on the table—in other words, no one could be nominated to the Supreme Court by this administration unless you are on that list of 25 that was cho-sen by those two groups, the Heritage Foundation and the Federalist Society. If you are a conservative, if you are seen as a conservative judge, a Federal court judge either in the district court or appellate court or maybe a State su-preme court justice where we have had some members of the U.S. Supreme Court have their start—if you are not on that list of 25, if you are one of the hundreds of judges appointed by Repub-lican Presidents, you need not apply because you don’t have any chance of getting on the Supreme Court if you are not on that favored list of 25. I think we can reach—and I think the administration could and should reach—a lot further than just a list of 25 that represent a very narrow view of justice, a narrow view of jurisprudence, and certainly a troubling view of the rights of working men and women, just by way of example. On the District of Columbia Circuit, Judge Kavanaugh has frequently dis-sented from his colleagues in cases in-volving workers’ rights, discrimina-tion, and retaliation, at times going out of his way to argue that the inter-ests of corporations should override the interests of individual workers. I serve on the Special Committee on Aging, where I happen to be serving as a ranking member in this Congress, along with Chairman S
USAN COLLINS , and I am especially astounded at some of Judge Kavanaugh’s opinions relating to both older Americans and people with disabilities. Just by way of exam-ple, he dissented in two cases that

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES6426 October 2, 2018 
upheld the Affordable Care Act, which is essential to ensuring healthcare for over 130 million Americans with pre-existing conditions. Right now, the courts are considering whether people with preexisting condi-tions should continue to be protected from being charged more, being denied coverage, or being dropped from their insurance simply because of their in-surance status. The Supreme Court might be the last line of defense in maintaining these protections for peo-ple with preexisting conditions, and Judge Kavanaugh could be that decid-ing vote. In two cases, Judge Kavanaugh dis-agreed with rulings upholding—uphold-ing—the Affordable Care Act. A former law clerk for Judge Kavanaugh said it best when she spoke about his views of the Affordable Care Act. She said: ‘‘No other contender on President Trump’s list is on record so vigorously criti-cizing the law’’—‘‘the law’’ meaning the Affordable Care Act. Also, in notable cases, Judge Kavanaugh sided with employers over employees with disabilities, making it more difficult for employees to prove discrimination in court and have their rights protected under law. In one dis-sent, he took a narrow view of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, also known as the ADEA, which has protected the rights of older workers for decades, and Judge Kavanaugh wrote that he did not believe it applied to certain Federal employees. Perhaps most egregiously, in Doe v. DC, Judge Kavanaugh determined that three women with intellectual disabil-ities could be forced to undergo elec-tive surgery, allowing the government to make medical decisions on their be-half without ever attempting to deter-mine their wishes. I could go on to a whole other line of cases—or maybe not lines of cases but commentaries he has made on Execu-tive power, but we don’t have time today. That issue is of great concern because of what we are confronted with, where we have an investigation underway by Robert Mueller that in-volves the executive branch. Of course, a deciding vote on the Supreme Court on any issue is significant, but maybe because of the current posture—or the current circumstances we are in— Judge Kavanaugh’s views on Executive power are a whole series of other con-cerns we have. These disturbing views are apparent not just from his decisions and his writings but of course from the public record. What other positions did Judge Kavanaugh take before he was on the bench? What views are set forth, for ex-ample, in the record from the time he spent as White House Staff Secretary and in the White House Counsel’s Of-fice? We have to ask that question. We don’t have his full record from his ten-ure working in the administration of President George W. Bush. Why don’t we have access to those records? We have to ask that question. Why don’t we have access to that basic informa-tion? We don’t have these records because Republicans in the Senate have been rushing to jam this nomination through before the midterm elections. They have broken norms and deprived the Senate of critical background doc-uments to get Judge Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court bench before November. Instead of following precedent and waiting for the nonpartisan National Archives to review and release Judge Kavanaugh’s full record, they have rushed to hold hearings and a com-mittee vote before we even have the in-formation all Senators are entitled to before voting on a lifetime appoint-ment. Let me move to what happened last week. Last Thursday, the Nation watched as Dr. Christine Blasey Ford shared with the Senate Judiciary Com-mittee the horrible details of a sexual assault she experienced as a 15-year- old: the terror she felt in that moment, the horror of the physical assault, and the psychological trauma of believing she might, in fact, die. We heard her describe how two teenage boys, under the influence of alcohol, pushed her into a bedroom, locked the door, turned up the music, and how one of the boys pinned her to the bed and cov-ered her mouth to muffle her screams; how she escaped and heard them drunkenly ‘‘pinballing’’ down the stair-case. We also heard how her clearest memory from that assault was the boys’ laughter while it was underway. Dr. Ford said she was ‘‘terrified’’ as she appeared before the Judiciary Com-mittee to recount these traumatic events, but she decided to do so be-cause she believed it was her ‘‘civic duty’’ to tell the public what she had experienced. She was open with the committee and consistent in her ac-count and was ‘‘100 percent’’ certain that it was Brett Kavanaugh who had assaulted her. When I watched her testimony from beginning to end, the conclusion I reached was that she was both credible and persuasive. I believed her, and I think a lot of Americans did as well; maybe more than half of Americans be-lieved her, but I know I did. I also believe Judge Kavanaugh’s re-sponse that same day, on Thursday, to these credible allegations has cast even greater doubt on his credibility. It also cast doubt on his temperament and his ability to serve as an impartial jurist. I think anyone, even a supporter of Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination, could have been troubled by his demeanor, and I will use the word ‘‘temperament’’ again, when he came before the com-mittee. After Dr. Ford presented her moving testimony, Judge Kavanaugh re-sponded with explosive anger and par-tisan attacks on virtually all Demo-crats. I was surprised he did that. No one would begrudge him the oppor-tunity and the necessity, if he felt it were necessary, to deny these allega-tions aggressively. No one would deny him of that, but to question the mo-tives of virtually every Democrat—at least every Democrat on the com-mittee—and to assert some kind of broad, partisan conspiracy, I think was over the top and is not consistent with the demeanor anyone would expect from any judge at any level but espe-cially someone who might be the fifth vote on the most powerful Court in the country and arguably the most power-ful Court in the world. I think most people, for or against Judge Kavanaugh, would conclude that his demeanor that day was not demeanor that was consistent with that high po-sition he was seeking. Another troubling aspect of his testi-mony that day—and I was rather sur-prised by this—is when he was asked about an FBI investigation, whether he would support additional investigative work by the FBI, simply to update the background check or to complete the background check, instead of request-ing a full and open FBI investigation that would show he had nothing to hide, he dodged questions and mis-represented the testimony of key wit-nesses. There is an old inscription on a build-ing where I used to work in Harrisburg, our State capital, the Finance Build-ing, which reads very simply: ‘‘Open to every inspection, secure from every suspicion.’’ In this case, if Judge Kavanaugh were open to that inspec-tion or, in this case, that investigation or a continuing investigation or back-ground check, I think a lot of people would have accorded him more credi-bility or more confidence in what he was saying—if he said, please, complete the background check and have the FBI take a look at all of these ques-tions—but he kept saying it was not his call. That may be technically true, but I was hoping he would support the investigation. If Judge Kavanaugh has done nothing wrong, as he and the White House and Senate Republicans claim, he should have welcomed a full, open, and independent investigation into these claims against him or any other matter that is relevant. I am glad the FBI is finally con-ducting an investigation, although I am concerned about reports that the White House may be limiting the in-vestigation and directing its scope. The FBI must be allowed to question all relevant individuals and follow the facts where they lead. The FBI is the best in the world, and I have great con-fidence they will do good work. They shouldn’t be constrained in this very limited period of time, this 1 week they are investigating. I hope—and I don’t know the answer to this, but I hope what the President said yesterday; that he and his administration are not constraining the FBI, and I am para-phrasing, not using exact words—that is the policy the administration trans-mitted directly to the FBI. I hope there is no variance or difference between what the President said and what his

administration is indicating directly to the FBI. I don’t know, but I hope there is a consistency there. I wish to wrap up because I know we have to do that. The Supreme Court de-cides, as so many Americans under-stand, cases of monumental impor-tance to our Nation. These cases will impact the day-to-day lives of Ameri-cans for decades, if not generations, and many questions will be decided by the Supreme Court. Let me just list a few: the American people’s ability to access affordable healthcare, for exam-ple; their opportunity to work in an en-vironment free from discrimination; their ability to access the justice sys-tem and have their day in court, often against powerful corporate interests; and, as I said at the outset, the basic rights of working men and women, in-cluding the right to organize and the right to bargain collectively. I hope that when Members of the Senate are making a determination about this nomination, they will take those inter-ests and those concerns into their de-liberations. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from South Dakota. Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be able to complete my remarks. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. 
FAA REAUTHORIZATION ACT  
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, aviation continues to play a significant role in the American economy and in Amer-ican life. The industry contributes $1.6 trillion to the economy on an annual basis and supports more than 10.6 mil-lion jobs. In 2017, 850 million passengers boarded U.S. airline flights for both do-mestic and international trips. Ameri-cans rely on planes to do their jobs, to catch up with far-flung friends, and to take a much needed break from work, to make it to important family events. Every few years, Congress has to pass legislation to reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration, the govern-ment agency responsible for everything from overseeing the safety of the na-tional airspace to providing grants for critical infrastructure needs at air-ports. Passing that reauthorization bill gives us the opportunity to take a look at aviation as a whole and to hear from manufacturers, airport administrators, airlines, and the flying public. That is exactly what we did with the reauthor-ization bill that is before the Senate today. In the lead-up to this bill, we spent months conducting research, holding hearings in the Commerce Committee which I chair, and listening to the aviation community and to airline pas-sengers. Then we took that informa-tion and used it to develop legislation that will strengthen aviation, promote economic growth, enhance transpor-tation safety and security, and improve the flying experience for the public. I am proud of the bill we have before us today and grateful for the hard work done by Members of both parties in the House and Senate. Obviously, security is a massive pri-ority for the airline industry and for the flying public and for the Federal Government. Terrorist groups continue to target passenger aircraft and the aviation sector, but security measures, of course, can also lead to frustration. Who hasn’t been caught in a long TSA line desperately hoping to make it through in time to catch a flight? The bill before us today will both boost se-curity and help reduce some of the delays associated with security checks. For starters, the bill represents the first-ever reauthorization of the Trans-portation Security Administration in the history of the agency. It estab-lishes a 5-year term for the head of the TSA which will increase leadership sta-bility at the TSA and promote the effi-cient and effective deployment of secu-rity initiatives. The bill also puts in place measures to speed the deployment of the latest, most effective screening technologies so we can keep up with the latest threats to aviation. It requires an agencywide review at the TSA to look at how to eliminate duplication and re-dundant senior personnel to ensure that the agency operates in the most efficient manner possible. This legislation also authorizes more K–9 teams to be deployed in airports and other transportation facilities around the United States, and it cre-ates an outside certification process to enable faster deployment. This is good news both for security and for pas-sengers. K–9 teams enhance security at airports, and security checkpoints with K–9 teams can operate substantially more quickly. Currently, a majority of explosive de-tection dogs in the United States come from overseas. Being able to obtain more of these dogs in the United States would reduce the cost and speed up the process of acquiring K–9 teams. That is why this bill helps build our capacity to test and certify explosive detection dogs here at home. In another victory for anyone who has ever waited in a long security line, this bill also requires the TSA to post real-time security checkpoint wait times not just at the airport but also online. That means you will be able to check the security wait time while you are still at home so you will know if you need to leave for a flight or if you can spend a few more minutes review-ing your packing list. The bill will also make it easier for travelers to sign up for Precheck and to receive expedited screening—some-thing that will speed up checkpoint wait times and enhance public area se-curity for all passengers. While we are on the subject of mak-ing life easier for passengers, this bill contains some commonsense reforms that will improve the flying experi-ence. For starters, this legislation pro-hibits airlines from involuntarily bumping from a flight passengers who have already boarded. I think we can all agree that once you have boarded a plane, you shouldn’t be kicked off until you have arrived at your destination. I also think everyone would agree that when you pay for a service, you should get it. That is why this legisla-tion requires airlines to promptly re-turn fees for services they don’t de-liver. If you pay for a seat assignment, for example, you should get that seat. If you don’t, you should get your money back promptly. This legislation also directs the FAA to set minimum legroom requirements for seats on commercials flights to en-sure safety. As I mentioned above, the aviation industry makes a big contribution to our economy, and the legislation before the Senate today will help this indus-try continue to compete and innovate. The FAA sets standards for aircraft de-signs and other aircraft components, and it certifies these designs to ensure they meet specific requirements. This legislation will take excess bureauc-racy out of the certification process so that U.S. air companies can get their products to market on time and suc-cessfully compete in the global mar-ketplace. It will also enable U.S. manu-facturers to fully use certification au-thorities that have been delegated to them. The bill before us today also supports the development of the air-based tech-nologies of the future, including the re-turn of supersonic aircraft and the in-tegration of unmanned aircraft sys-tems—more commonly known as drones—into the international air-space. The bill advances the develop-ment of low-altitude traffic manage-ment services, which are essential as drone use becomes more widespread. It also provides more flexibility to the FAA to approve advanced drone oper-ations, like extended flights or flights over crowds of people, and it directs the FAA to authorize operators of small drones to carry packages, mean-ing that sometime in the near future, your Amazon Prime order could arrive via drone. In the wake of serious accidents on our Nation’s roads, railroads, or in the sky, Congress turns to the National Transportation Safety Board to get the facts and to tell us what went wrong. The legislation before us today will strengthen the National Transpor-tation Safety Board’s investigation process and make more information available to the public. It will also ex-pand access to assistance for the fami-lies of victims of rail and aviation acci-dents. There are a lot of other good provi-sions in this bill, as well, everything from infrastructure investment to up-grades in safety requirements. Mostly unrelated to aviation, this bill also in-cludes critically needed disaster re-sponse reforms and a down payment to help communities in the Carolinas re-cover from Hurricane Florence.

FAA REAUTHORIZATION ACT  
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the Federal Aviation Administration, or the FAA, Reauthorization Act of 2018. This bill provides needed certainty in aviation and gives the FAA authority to enhance consumer protections and passenger safety. It also maintains critical investments that will help to modernize and maintain our aviation infrastructure. This agreement is the product of bi-partisan negotiations over the last sev-eral months. I am proud to serve on the Commerce Committee, which played a major role here. I thank Senator T
HUNE and Senator N ELSON for their work on this bill, and I urge my col-leagues to support it. Minnesota has a long aviation tradi-tion, from Charles Lindbergh to our Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport. Two years in a row, it was ranked as the best airport in America. We manufacture jets in Duluth at Cir-rus. We manufacture parachutes that go with those jets in our State. We have first-rate military training bases for aviation in Bloomington and in Du-luth. We have very strong regional air-ports, including Duluth and Rochester, which has recently expanded its air-port. It matters in our State. For too long, the aviation sector of our economy has had to rely on a series of short-term extensions. It is not good for workers, and it is not good for busi-nesses. That is not good for travelers who use our services. For airports looking to expand or airlines looking to test new routes, these short-term bills created uncertainty that ham-pered growth and prevented new in-vestments. This 5-year reauthorization bill will provide the long-term stability needed to encourage investments and help maintain American leadership in the global aviation marketplace. We know a lot about that in our State, being a major Delta hub, as well as the home of Sun Country Airlines. We know the kind of global competition that we are up against all the time. That is a very important reason for America to be a leader in aviation and not a follower. Changes in the airline industry in re-cent years have drastically altered the way consumers travel. New fees and complicated itineraries can make even routine travel confusing and expensive. Thankfully, this FAA bill builds on im-portant work we have done in past re-authorizations to strengthen protec-tions for consumers while shopping, booking, and traveling. Most people know what it is like to show up to the airport and be shocked to find out that you have to pay extra for your seat or that checking a bag is going to cost you an arm and a leg. When consumers don’t have this infor-mation up front, they can be left pay-ing hundreds of dollars in fees they didn’t budget for, which can mean the difference between a family trip being affordable or not. It isn’t just fees. In some instances, online travel websites have sold unnec-essarily complicated passenger itineraries, provided outdated or incor-rect travel information on their websites, and failed to provide appro-priate disclosures for passengers. That is why I worked to include an amend-ment to provide a consistent level of consumer protections, regardless of where the airfares are purchased. This part of the bill will ensure that, wheth-er a consumer books tickets directly with an airline or from a third party, the consumer will receive the same level of price disclosures and customer service. This was a provision strongly sup-ported by consumer groups because it is such a problem that there were dif-ferent types of price disclosures and customer service, depending on how a consumer booked the flight. It doesn’t matter where you book the flight or how you book the flight, you should have consumer protection. This bill in-cludes that provision. This bill will also make important improvements to the passenger experi-ence on the plane. By directing the FAA to set standards for the size of airline seats, we will make sure pas-sengers can travel safely and these seats will not get even smaller than they already are. The agreement also includes a provi-sion to make clear that once a pas-senger has boarded a plane, they can’t be involuntarily bumped by an airline. Passengers deserve to be treated with respect throughout their entire jour-ney, and this will end the practice of removing paying customers to accom-modate airline employees. The bill sets new requirements for airlines to promptly return fees for services, such as seat assignments or early boarding, when these services are purchased and not received by a cus-tomer. In addition to the strong consumer protections, this bill makes new infra-structure investments that will help to ensure passengers have a safe and effi-cient travel experience. Smaller regional airports provide a vital link to the rest of the world for many rural communities. In my State, both residents and businesses located near these rural airports rely on them to connect to the Twin Cities and be-yond. The Essential Air Service Program is a critical tool that supports rural air service. This bill boosts EAS funding to help maintain the operations of small-er, regional airports across Minnesota and across our country. Of course, funding alone isn’t enough to improve aviation infrastructure. We need poli-cies that support the unique infrastruc-ture needs in different regions of the country. In the 2012 FAA reauthorization, I in-cluded a provision to require that the Department of Transportation give pri-ority review to construction projects in cold weather States with shorter con-struction seasons. For those of us who live in States that happen to have cold weather and snow, our construction seasons are shorter, and that means we have less time to work on these projects than maybe they do in Miami or in California. What we did here was to make sure that the FAA realized that in how they did grants and how they got these construction permits approved. Anyone who has ever been to North-ern Minnesota in April or October un-derstands that our construction season is shorter. There is a reason we have cold weather testing facilities on the Canadian border in our State, because that is the coldest conditions you can possibly have for cars. That makes for this short construction season. This provision was included again in the current bill, and it will help to en-sure that cold weather States like Min-nesota can make the most out of our limited construction seasons. The investments made by this bill are an important down payment that will help to address the growing de-mand for air transportation. I look for-ward to building on the progress made by this bill with bipartisan infrastruc-ture legislation to support 21st century aviation infrastructure that is pre-pared to meet the demands of the 21st century economy. I wish to thank my colleagues again for their work on this bill. It makes

important advances in security, con-sumer protections, and infrastructure development. I was proud to be a part of this, and I also am glad these provi-sions I worked hard on are included in the bill. The aviation industry and American air passengers will be safer because of this bill. I urge my col-leagues to support this bipartisan agreement so we can pass, finally, a long-term extension into law. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Massachusetts. Mr. MARKEY. Thank you, Mr. Presi-dent. It is Congress’s obligation to protect the public from abusive practices that harm consumers and dull the competi-tive process. Regrettably, Congress has failed to fulfill that obligation with the FAA reauthorization bill. With this bill, Congress has missed a historic, once-in-a-generation oppor-tunity to stop gargantuan airlines from gouging Americans with exorbi-tant fees. Last year, Senator R
OGER  W
ICKER , a Republican from Mississippi, and I secured a provision in the Senate FAA reauthorization bill that would protect passengers from ridiculous, sky-high airline fees. Our FAIR Fees— Forbidding Airlines from Imposing Ri-diculous Fees—provision directed the Department of Transportation to, No. 1, assess whether change and cancella-tion, baggage, and other fees are rea-sonable and proportional to the costs of the services which are being pro-vided, and secondly, to ensure that change and cancellation fees are rea-sonable. Airline fees would be fair and reason-able—that is all the provision did. The reason we need that is simple. In a truly competitive industry, an airline would be unable to charge unreason-able fees because their competitors would undercut their prices. Dar-winian, paranoia-inducing competition would drive down fees to reflect the ac-tual costs of the services provided—the cost to check a bag, the cost to change a flight reservation, the cost of book-ing a passenger on standby for an ear-lier flight. Fair and reasonable. But the airline industry is far from competi-tive. In the past 10 years, we have gone from 10 major airlines down to 4. Four airlines now control 85 percent of traf-fic in the skies. An analysis from the U.S. Travel Association found that 74 airports are served by only 1 airline, while 155 airports are dominated by 1 carrier controlling over 50 percent of seat capacity. Here is the result: sky- high airline fees and a growing frustra-tion with the modern flying experience. To the surprise of no one, the airline industry launched a ferocious lobbying blitz against our bipartisan FAIR Fees provision, making its elimination from the bill their top priority. The airline industry lobbed all sorts of false accu-sations against these commonsense protections—profitability of the air-lines would go down, passengers would no longer be able to change or cancel their flights—but not once did the in-dustry actually defend the price of all of these fees to cancel or to change a flight. Not once did the industry actu-ally demonstrate that their fees are reasonable and proportional to the cost of the services provided. That is be-cause those costs are not proportional to the services being provided to the customer by the airlines. The independent Government Ac-countability Office, GAO, recently re-leased a report confirming what count-less passengers across the country al-ready know to be true: Airlines are gouging captive passengers to line their pockets, not to cover the actual costs of the services being provided. During a hearing last year, representa-tives from United Airlines and Amer-ican Airlines testified that their change and cancellation fees bear no resemblance to the costs borne by the airline for actually canceling a ticket or changing a flight reservation. Even in the past few weeks, as we worked in Congress to include impor-tant consumer protection measures in this final FAA legislation, the airlines continued to raise fees. That is how confident the airlines were that their powerful industry lobbyists would re-move my provision and Senator W
ICKER ’s provision from the bill. De-spite bipartisan support, despite the provisions included in the Senate bill, and despite the public outcry, the air-line lobby knew that they could count on Congress to do their bidding, so they raised their fees anyway. Last month, JetBlue Airways changed its cancellation fees from $150 to $200 for certain flights. JetBlue also raised fees for a passenger’s first checked bag from $25 to $30 and in-creased the fees for a second checked bag from $35 to $40. That is $140 to check two bags roundtrip. Not surpris-ingly, almost immediately after, United Airlines, Delta Airlines, and American Airlines followed suit, rais-ing their bag fees to match JetBlue’s. When I sent letters to the 11 major airlines inquiring as to why airline fees are on the rise even though there ap-pears to be no appreciable increase in the cost of services provided, the air-lines’ response was predictable. Eight airlines had refused to respond to my inquiry by last Thursday’s dead-line—a deadline I set to ensure that this body would have this critical in-formation in hand when considering the FAA bill. There has been no re-sponse from United, American, and Delta. That is unacceptable. Of the three airlines that did respond, two could not explain whether their fees were reasonable to the costs of the services provided. The other refused to address the matter altogether, claim-ing that this information is ‘‘propri-etary,’’ claiming that the flying public does not have the right to know if they are being gouged. That is the airline industry’s position. If it is not to cover the cost of the services provided—checking a bag, changing a flight reservation, can-celing a ticket—why are the airlines charging these fees? The answer is, be-cause they can. Last year, the airlines raked in $2.9 billion in change and can-cellation fees. That is equivalent to the cost of 11 million flights from Wash-ington to Boston. The airlines col-lected over $4.5 billion in checked bag fees, which is enough to buy 55 jumbo jets. The airlines have turned this nickel-and-diming into a multibillion- dollar industry—a $7.4 billion industry last year. Passengers think they are buying low-cost airfare, only to be gouged by proliferating airline fees. The American public wants Congress to stop these abusive practices, and here in the Senate, we answered their call. We secured a bipartisan provision in the Senate FAA bill that would have stopped this fee epidemic once and for all. But through an opaque process and after months of lobbying against my bipartisan FAIR Fees provision, the airlines won and airline passengers lost. What exactly are the airlines so afraid of? Why won’t they even respond to my letters? The FAIR Fees provi-sion doesn’t set fees; it only directs the Department of Transportation to set up a public process to assess those fees. But that is exactly what the airlines oppose. They don’t want to have to ex-plain this, to be transparent about what they are doing, because if they did, the American people would know the truth—this is price-gouging in its purest form. On behalf of the American flying pub-lic, the millions of Americans who are subjected to ridiculous airline fees, I will vote no on the FAA bill. And I vow to the public that this fight will not die with this bill. As the fees rise, pres-sure will mount on Congress to address this consumer protection, competition issue. We know the problem. FAIR Fees would have been the solution, but this bill does not include that solution, and this fight must go on. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Michigan. Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the bipartisan Fed-eral Aviation Administration Reau-thorization Act of 2018. After six short-term extensions rang-ing from 1 week to just over a year, the Senate will finally pass comprehensive legislation that will set FAA policy until 2023. These short-term extensions keep the lights on, but they deny us the opportunity to make meaningful changes and better serve the American people. I am a member of the Senate Com-mittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, and I am proud of our committee’s work that made this long- term reauthorization possible, but I am especially thankful to our committee chairman, J
OHN THUNE , and ranking member, B
ILLNELSON , for their leader-ship throughout this process. This bill makes critical investments in airport infrastructure. It promotes

competition and leadership in aviation, increases safety in the National Air-space System, and strengthens cus-tomer service practices across the com-mercial aviation sector. The legislation delivers very strong support to our rural communities in Michigan and across the Nation by con-tinuing the Essential Air Service, or EAS, Program. This program drives economic development and tourism while also connecting local residents to world-class healthcare. I will never stop fighting to ensure that Michigan’s EAS airports—from Muskegon, to Houghton/Hancock, to Alpena—get the funding they need to continue to serve their communities. In addition to driving sustained in-vestment in rural communities, I sup-port this long-term reauthorization be-cause it gave me an opportunity to ad-dress a number of critical challenges that are facing our country. This bill includes provisions I authored that will help prepare our students for the high- tech jobs of today and tomorrow, se-cure public spaces in our airports, and remove the outdated Federal require-ment that airports use firefighting foams containing fluorinated chemi-cals that contaminate groundwater and are causing disastrous human health effects across the country. The FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 will improve the competitiveness of our Nation’s workforce by clearing the way for our students and educators to use unmanned aircraft systems, or UAS, for research, education, and job training. Whether this technology is used for critical infrastructure or boosting crop yields at our farms, UAS technology will create tens of thou-sands of new jobs in the coming years, and we need American students and workers ready to take advantage of that. That is why I worked across the aisle with Senator M
ORAN to introduce the Higher Education Unmanned Air Systems Modernization Act and in-clude it in this long-term FAA bill. This provision has the support of the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities, the Association of Amer-ican Universities, and dozens of other colleges and universities all across our Nation. Our brightest minds will have the ability to design, refine, and fly UAS to prepare our country for the safe inte-gration of UAS into our National Air-space System. In my home State of Michigan, Alpena Community College has created a UAS pilot training program that complements existing certificate pro-grams, like the utility technology cer-tificate, making their graduates even more competitive. This will support job creation across the income spectrum, as our Nation’s workforce will be able to get the train-ing they need to operate these systems both safely and efficiently. Ultimately, whether we are talking about UAS, passenger planes in the air, or travelers making their way through the airport, this is all about safety. In recent years, we have seen high-profile attacks at airports around the world but also in places like Flint, MI. These attacks have demonstrated the vulner-abilities of heavily trafficked public areas outside of security screening, such as baggage claim and pickup and dropoff areas. I heard from our international air-port in Detroit and others across the country that current airport funding streams often cannot be used for secu-rity projects in these public spaces. Their need for greater flexibility for airport infrastructure improvements led me and my colleague Senator GARDNER to introduce the bipartisan Secure Airport Public Spaces Act. This legislation would increase safety and security for airport passengers and visitors outside of the TSA screening areas. A critical provision of our bill was incorporated into this reauthoriza-tion bill that will now allow airports to use Airport Improvement Program funds on state-of-the-art surveillance cameras in these public areas, which will help monitor, prevent, and respond to potential attacks at airports across our Nation. Finally, I would like to discuss what could be our Nation’s defining public health challenge for generations—a group of harmful chemicals known as PFAS. The PFAS class is a group of over 4,700 manmade chemicals that have been used nationwide and inter-nationally. These chemicals do not break down in the human body or in the environment, and they can accu-mulate over time and cause a great deal of harm. We already know that there are several health effects associ-ated with exposure to certain PFAS. A few examples include compromised im-mune system function, cancers, endo-crine disruption, and cognitive effects. I have listened to families exposed to PFAS in Michigan, but PFAS are not just a Michigan issue. We know that there are over 170 sites in 40 States that are contaminated with PFAS. PFAS are so pervasive that it is esti-mated that up to 110 million Americans could have these chemicals in their water. PFAS chemicals have been used for decades in a wide range of consumer products, including textiles, paper products, and cookware. In addition to all of these uses, they have also been used in firefighting foams for decades. These foams have been used on mili-tary bases and in our commercial air-ports. They have been used near busi-nesses and neighborhoods, near ground water and surface water, near lakes and streams. Last week, I worked with Senator R
ANDPAULto convene a hearing in our Federal Spending Oversight Sub-committee that addressed the Federal Government’s role in PFAS. We heard firsthand about the impact of this pub-lic health crisis on community mem-bers, firefighters, and veterans. Not only have these foams containing PFAS been used for decades, we are still requiring their use at American airports even as safe alternatives are now being developed and deployed abroad. While there is a lot of work to be done related to remediation, human health research, filter technology, and more, we must stop making this prob-lem worse. This is why I worked with Senators SULLIVAN , STABENOW , RUBIO, S
HAHEEN , GILLIBRAND , and H ASSAN to lead a commonsense addition to this FAA bill. Our bipartisan provision gives air-ports the option to use fluorine-free foams. I also appreciate Congressman K
ILDEE for leading this effort in the House of Representatives. Using fluorine-free foams is not a novel idea, but it is an idea whose time has come. Over 70 airports around the world are already using fluorine-free foams that have passed the most chal-lenging of tests, and they have seen real success in combating fires. These airports include major international hubs such as Dubai, London Heathrow, Manchester, and Copenhagen. Every major airport in Australia has already made this transition. It is past time that we catch up, and I am happy too that this important legislation will finally allow American airports to embrace safe, innovative firefighting technologies and stop using fluorinated foams. I want to thank Chairman T
HUNE and Ranking Member N
ELSON , as well as Leader M
CCONNELL and Leader S CHU-
MER, for their work to pass this impor-tant bipartisan legislation. I urge my colleagues to support this critical long-term FAA reauthorization that will help keep PFAS out of our water. It will help drive investment in our Nation’s workforce, and it will help ensure that our airports and skies are safe. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Washington. 
TRIBUTE TO SSG RONALD J . SHURER  
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I come to the floor to talk about the FAA reauthorization bill. Before I do that, I would like to take a moment to recognize a graduate of Rogers High School in Puyallup, WA. SSG Ronald J. Shurer II, who received the Medal of Honor yesterday for his selfless her-oism in Afghanistan. When he heard wounded members of his team were trapped on a hill, he didn’t hesitate. In the face of heavy enemy fire, Staff Sergeant Shurer shielded three wounded teammates with his own body and helped them reach safety. I congratulate Staff Sergeant Shurer for his heroism and bravery and his sacrifice, and I would like to congratu-late him and his family on his receiv-ing this honor. We in Washington are very proud of Staff Sergeant Shurer.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6431 October 2, 2018 
considering very shortly, I am pleased that the Senate is looking at a 5-year reauthorization. It wasn’t that long ago that we were talking about short-term extensions and didn’t know if we could get to this point of clearing the rest of these issues. I would like to thank my col-leagues Chairman T
HUNE , Ranking Member N
ELSON , and Aviation Sub-committee Chairman B
LUNT for help-ing get us to this point. The work we have done on this legis-lation is so important because it is helping U.S. commercial aviation re-main the safest and most secure in the world and to improve the traveling public’s experience. Just like so many other reauthoriza-tions, this reflects an agreement by Congress on the need to focus on safety and security, to implement the latest and greatest technologies, and to in-crease the use of bomb-sniffing dogs to help the flying public feel more secure and to move quickly through our air-ports. This legislation recognizes the values of the latest technologies across many aspects of the aviation sector from NextGen—which allows us to fly more efficiently—to expanded use of un-manned aerial vehicle systems, to new TSA equipment that, as I said, will help us move through security lines more efficiently and help make us safer. While we need to keep on working to address infrastructure needs at our crowded airports, I can tell you most specifically that, for the Pacific North-west, where we have seen some of the fastest growth in air transportation and demand by the public in recent years, this 5-year reauthorization does provide the FAA with the certainty it needs to use its Airport Improvement Program to invest in long-term projects that will help us increase ca-pacity at large and small airports. Again, I can’t tell you how important this is for airports all over the State of Washington. Many of us know that about 90 percent of businesses are housed within about 10 miles of an air-port. So the investment in the airport and airport infrastructure is an invest-ment in our economy for the future. These projects in this bill, like the new runway that will be completed next year at Pullman-Moscow Regional Air-port in eastern Washington with $100 million in Federal funding, gives com-munities the tools they need to keep that economy growing. I can tell you, it is growing. With WSU and other institutions in the re-gion, it is helping grow and attract some of the best technology in Next Generation Energy. The fact that the airport is able to expand helps all of us in the region grow. The Federal funding that will con-tinue to be provided in this bill is crit-ical for airports to increase their ca-pacity and help our economy. Under programs reauthorized in this legisla-tion, Sea-Tac is currently completing a $14 million runway and taxi recon-struction. Spokane has received $15 million for airfield improvements, and airports from Everett to Walla Walla to Winthrop have each received mil-lions of dollars through these programs to keep their facilities up to date. The Tri-Cities Airport in Pasco was awarded $7 million to install an inline baggage screening system in their new terminal. Yes, our airports depend on to continue to move forward on FAA and infrastructure investment. This legislation also expands the Small Community Air Service Develop-ment Program, which provides grants to communities to help them attract and maintain critical air service by creating marketing programs and pro-viding incentives to airlines. This has been a great tool for our State, includ-ing airports in Walla Walla, Spokane, Yakima, Wenatchee, and Pasco, as they have used these resources to help grow service. Once service is estab-lished, it is easy to maintain. Why? Be-cause they have helped get the carrier and the traffic and they can see that it can be sustained. The United States has the best avia-tion safety record in the world, and the FAA’s oversight and certification pro-cedures are critical in maintaining that. This bill continues with making sure that those procedures remain strong. The bill helps us with what are called contract air traffic control towers in making sure that small communities that are working to retain air service can do so by making sure that their towers remain in operation. These con-tract towers provide a key layer of safety at smaller airports and in the region. Places like Yakima, Wenatchee, Spokane, Bellingham, Renton, and Walla Walla will not be saddled with the responsibility for these contract towers but will receive support so that they, too, can handle the demand of air transportation. Con-tract towers handle about 28 percent of ATC operations, yet they account for about 14 percent of the FAA’s tower op-erations budget. The bill recognizes the important role, also, that flight attendants play in ensuring cabin safety by making sure they receive adequate rest. This legislation finally puts them on par with our pilots. It says that they have to have their 10 hours of rest, as well, so that they can function and continue to help us with the traveling public. The bill preserves access to impor-tant safety tools. It bans the FAA from removing contract weather observers from airports for the next several years. Why is this so important? Be-cause at airports with changing condi-tions where we need human observa-tion of critical weather measurements, this helps us maintain safety. In places like Spokane, WA, where conditions can change quickly and freezing condi-tions can be quite common, this helps us maintain safety. The bill also takes important steps toward securing airports and airplanes with reauthorization of the Transpor-tation Security Administration. We know that there is no better tool in our airports today to helping us make sure they operate safely and se-curely by having explosive detecting K–9 units. That is why I was proud to lead a provision in the bill that will help us expand the use of bomb-detect-ing K–9s for screening our passengers and protecting the public at our air-ports. What we are seeing is that secu-rity lines at our airports move much more rapidly when these K–9s are present. Yes, they are a deterrent in and of themselves, and they help speed up lines. But they also are there to detect the use of explosives or other mate-rials, and they are doing an unbeliev-able job. That is why this provision al-lows for larger airports to get more K– 9 units certified by TSA and work with them to address long lines at our air-ports. In the Northwest, we have seen that these K–9s can do unbelievable things to help us. In fact, Seattle-Tacoma International Airport has been one of the fastest growing airports for the last several years, and the K–9s have helped us through these checkpoints in the passenger screening process where they can screen almost 60 percent more passengers per hour than a checkpoint without K–9s. It is so important that this legisla-tion helps us get more K–9s trained and more coordination between airports and TSA as these new tools are im-proved. We are so happy that it is in-cluded in this legislation. We also give smaller airports more tools to improve security. The bill con-tains a program to implement exit lane technology at small hub airports. It contains a $55 million authorization to reimburse airports for deploying local law enforcement officers to help main-tain public areas in large and small air-ports. These tools are also important be-cause our airports have had more and more responsibility; yet we need them to operate efficiently and effectively. At the same time, we are trying to im-prove the flying experience. More peo-ple are flying than ever before, and air-planes and airports are becoming more cramped and chaotic. This FAA bill is set to make sure that there are minimum dimensions for passenger seats. It raises the bar on some of the other safety improvements to make sure that the traveling public and disabled passengers are treated with dignity and respect. The bill also requires airlines to pro-vide prompt refunds so that passengers are paid in a timely fashion when they are due a refund. It also improves other technology in unmanned air systems, an increased use of important commercial, sci-entific, and public safety issues that are now at the advent of what we see with drone applications. These are so important because we want to move forward with our Coast

Guard, with our Forest Service, with transportation, using information and data to help us do our jobs better. This important piece of legislation helps us make sure we are improving safety and oversight by the right amount for these new systems that will be part of this package. I am so glad to have worked with my colleagues on this very broad bipar-tisan piece of legislation. I can’t tell you how important aviation is to the State of Washington. We are a big avia-tion-manufacturing State. Yes, we like to build and sell airplanes, but we also know that, as our economy has grown, our airports are a key tool, as they are in any State, to continue to grow and continue to manage the challenges of air transportation. This bill is the right tool for many airports across the State of Wash-ington and across the Nation to con-tinue to grow, to continue to manage that population growth, and ensure safety and efficiency. I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation. There are many more things we need to do, but this is a good down payment for the next 5 years. I thank Chairman T
HUNE and Rank-ing Member N
ELSON for getting us to this point today. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. H
OEVEN ). Without objection, it is so or-dered. Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I come to the floor to talk about a few good things that have happened in Washington this week. At a time when people are looking at Washington and wondering whether things are getting done, let me just suggest, on the floor this week, we are going to pass land-mark legislation that will deal with a crisis we have in our States—every sin-gle one of us—and that is the opioid issue. I will talk about that in a minute. 
FUNDING FOR NATIONAL PARKS  
Mr. President, first, let me mention that today, in the Energy and Natural Resources Committee and with a vote of 19 to 4, we passed legislation to help our national parks. It is historic in the sense that it is probably the most fund-ing we have ever put against the long- term maintenance problems at our parks. We have more visitors at our parks than ever. Yet we have crumbling roads and bridges and water systems. We have, literally, campgrounds and other areas that are closed off because of the lack of funding for these longer term projects, which is the deferred maintenance backlog—about $12 billion now. We have come up with a bipar-tisan solution to try to address that by using some of the oil and gas revenues, onshore and offshore, from Federal lands. It is an example of how we are moving things forward. USMCA  
Mr. President, finally, I am encour-aged that the President and his team have negotiated an agreement to add Canada, along with Mexico, to a new North American trade agreement. They are not calling it NAFTA; they have changed the name to the U.S.-Mexico- Canada Agreement. I think this is going to be a step forward. I have now looked at the summary from it. We don’t have the details yet—and I, of course, want to see the final details— but I think it has two general advan-tages for us. One is that it will encourage more production in North America of things like automobiles because you have to have a higher American content—Ca-nadian, Mexican, and U.S. content now—in automobiles than you did under the old agreement. You will have more cars being built in America and North America as well as auto parts. I think that is good. I also think there are other things in the agreement that will help to encour-age production in the United States be-cause it will level the playing field more with our country. It does things with regard to Canada that are long overdue to try to keep it from putting protection policies in place on its agri-culture products, especially its dairy products. So, when it sends powdered milk to us now, it can’t take advantage of the subsidies it is providing for its milk producers, as an example. It lets our dairy farmers be able to compete on a more level playing field. Those are the kinds of things that are in the agreement. I, again, look for-ward to seeing the entire agreement. I think having a North American com-pact that is updated is good because the NAFTA agreement was 24 years old. We have modernized it and put new labor standards in place, as an exam-ple. The second, again, is to level the playing field further with these coun-tries in our region that are our allies and, therefore, should not be viewed as national security threats. We shouldn’t be putting tariffs in place on them on a national security basis, which we were doing and threatening to do more of, including on autos under section 232, it is called. We now have better trade agreements with these countries that are our allies but that also had some barriers in place for our exports. We need to be sure their imports are going to be fairly traded in this coun-try. So it is positive, I think, to have this agreement. Now, frankly, it enables us as a North American market to be more ef-fective in dealing with some of the trade disputes we have had with other parts of the world, most notably with China, with which we do have a lot of unfair trade going on. China is not playing by the rules often, and this helps us to have Canada and Mexico with us to be able to address those issues with China, as an example. Those are some of the things that are happening this week that I am happy about, and I think we are making some progress. 
OPIOID EPIDEMIC  
Mr. President, let me go back to what is going to be voted on, on this floor, I am told, sometime tomorrow. Probably tomorrow afternoon, this Senate will take up legislation that has now been passed in the House and passed in the Senate. There has been a conference committee between the two bodies, and it has come up with a final product. I think the final product has a lot of good things in it that will help push back against this opioid epidemic that is growing in our country. On my way to Washington yesterday, I went by a memorial service for a young man who had died of an opioid overdose. I had known him and have known his family for a long time. It strikes close to home for pretty much everybody in this Chamber, I am sure, and for pretty much everybody who is listening. When we have our tele-town-hall meetings and I ask this question, which I do regularly—I had two tele- townhall meetings last month—‘‘Have you been affected by the opioid issue,’’ most people say yes. In fact, in parts of our State, in Southeastern Ohio, where we had a tele-townhall meeting recently, two- thirds of the people on the call said, yes, they were directly affected. That is because, sadly, this issue has grown to the point where last year 72,000 Americans lost their lives to the opioid epidemic. That is more people than we lost in the entire Vietnam war in 1 year. That many people died from opioid overdoses in 1 year. It is a grim statistic, and it is a record level. Although Congress has done some good things in the last couple of years in passing legislation to help, those legislative efforts to have better pre-vention programs in place, more treat-ment offered, more longer term recov-ery programs, more first responders with Narcan—this miracle drug that can reverse the effects of an overdose— that is starting to happen, but it is being overwhelmed with the influx of drugs, particularly this new synthetic form of opioid that is coming into our communities. It is usually called fentanyl, some-times it is called carfentanil, but in my home State of Ohio and in other States around the country, this is resulting with a much higher overdose death rate than even the horrible drugs like heroin and the prescription drugs that are causing these opioid addictions— cocaine, methamphetamines, and crys-tal meth. This drug, fentanyl, is grow-ing and growing rapidly. I will tell you, in Ohio, we had about a 4,000-percent increase in fentanyl overdose deaths just in the last 5 years. Let me repeat that. There was a 4,000- percent increase in deaths from

fentanyl. About two-thirds of our over-dose deaths over time in Ohio are due to this synthetic form of opioid. By the way, this stuff is coming from overseas, mostly through our U.S. mail system. It is outrageous that this is being permitted without the proper screening. The legislation we are going to vote on this week—probably tomorrow afternoon—will finally put in place leg-islation called the STOP Act that we have worked on. Senator K
LOBUCHAR  and I are the coauthors of it. We have worked on this for 3 years now to get it to this point. We had hearings. We had an inves-tigation in the Permanent Sub-committee on Investigations to under-stand what was going on and how to deal with it, how to stop it. We found out, unbelievably, that the U.S. Postal Service is the main conduit for this poison. We also found out that the Postal Service is pushing back against putting additional screening in place. We also found out that private car-riers, like FedEx, UPS, or DHL, will re-quire every single package to have ad-vanced electronic information provided to law enforcement to help stop this poison, to be able to find that needle in the haystack, that package out of the 900 million the post office deals with every year that might have this poison in it. Under this legislation, the STOP Act, the post office is now going to have to do what these other private carriers do, and that is really important. In our investigation, where we used undercover resources to talk to websites, to find out what was being of-fered, to look behind the websites to find out what was really going on with this fentanyl issue, we found out that if you shipped it by the U.S. mail sys-tem, they guaranteed delivery but not if you shipped it through a private car-rier. Why? Because they knew the pri-vate carriers had this electronic data that provided in advance what is in it, where it is going, where it is coming from, and then law enforcement can use Big Data to figure out what pack-ages are suspect and take them offline. I have seen that done at the distribu-tion centers of these private carriers. I have also spent a lot of time talking to the post office about it. They are now going to implement this legislation, I hope, aggressively. It requires 100 percent of packages, within a couple of years, to have this data on it and right away for China. It will be 100 percent for China this year because, according to law enforcement, unfortunately, China is the country where most of this is coming from. It gives us the opportunity to be able to stop some of this poison coming into our communities. That is really impor-tant. To me, getting that passed is just common sense. I think it is overdue. I am disappointed it took us this long. How many people had to die before Congress stood up and did the right thing with regard to telling our own post office, ‘‘You have to provide better screening’’? So it should be done. Having said that, that is not going to solve the problem. Yes, having a cutoff of some of the supply of this poison is important. To a certain extent, it stops it from coming into our communities, and it is going to raise the price on the street because you are cutting the sup-ply. That is important because it is so cheap and so powerful. It is 50 times more powerful than heroin, but that is not the ultimate solution. The ultimate solution is us, isn’t it? It is in our hearts, in our families, in our communities to push back by hav-ing better prevention and education in place, by ensuring people who become addicted, who have this disease of ad-diction, have access to treatment to get them better so their lives can be turned around and they can go back to their families and to their work and to being productive citizens. We need longer term recovery pro-grams because we know shorter term treatment isn’t very successful. So many people relapse after a short-term treatment program, but a longer term recovery program with it—let’s say with sober housing—with support from people who are recovery coaches who have been in recovery themselves, that is going to lead to a more successful re-sult. Drug courts are very important in this. This legislation we are going to vote on this week does have the STOP Act, but it also has these other pieces. It re-authorizes the drug court system, as an example, diverting people out of incar-ceration into drug courts where they agree they are going to go into treat-ment and stay clean or risk going back into prison or jail if they don’t. That has worked very effectively in parts of my State and around the country, as an example, to get people clean. The legislation also does something really important that some of us have been fighting for years. We have had legislation to do this for the last 3 years, but it has really been about a 10- year battle. It is this issue of treat-ment centers that receive reimburse-ment from Medicaid being capped at a certain number of beds with a certain number of days that people can stay. It is called the IMD exclusion, or the In-stitutions for Mental Disease exclu-sion. This is an arcane part of Federal law. It is an example where, well-intended, years ago Congress said: We are going to put this limitation in place on treat-ment centers because we want to dein-stitutionalize people, particularly in mental health facilities, because we have had some examples of abuse in these institutional care settings and people aren’t getting the help they need so let’s limit the number of beds you can have in these treatment cen-ters on the mental health side to try to deal with the problem. Then the opioid crisis came. I would argue even before the opioid crisis this was true with regard to cocaine and meth and other things. Beds are at a premium in many places in our coun-try. I have spots in Ohio that don’t have any treatment centers. I have communities that literally don’t have a place where people can go. So what happens is, these people go out of the county or out of their communities to find a place or they simply don’t find treatment. Other examples are where people go to a treatment center, and they are told: Sorry, you have to come back in a couple of weeks. We just don’t have any beds. There is nothing more heartbreaking than talking to a family or talking to a parent, as I have done, who talks about, in this case, his daughter going to a treatment center with him and his wife. She was finally ready—and when you are ready with this disease, with this addiction disease, you need to act. You need to get into treatment. She was ready, but they told her: There is no room at the inn. There is no bed for you. You have to come back in a couple of weeks. It was during those 2 weeks that she had a tough time. She overdosed again in their home and died. That family is really happy about this legislation because this will say to these treatment centers: You are not going to be capped at a certain number of beds. If you are doing a good job and providing the kind of treatment we want to have you provide, we don’t want you to be capped at a certain number of beds. Again, this legislation that is cur-rently in place with the 16-bed limit is a vestige of another time. This will en-able us to take that limit off and pro-vide more treatment to so many Amer-icans. We also provided in this legislation that those who want to get this exclu-sion lifted also have to provide at least two kinds of medication-assisted treat-ment to people, which we know, based on the evidence—depending on the per-son—is more successful. So we want to encourage people to offer medication- assisted treatment to get people off their addiction. It also says it is not limited to a cer-tain kind of drug. There was some ex-pansion of this in the previous legisla-tion in the House, and some of us in the Senate introduced a bill a few weeks ago that is very similar to our final product that said: Let’s not limit it just to those who have opioid addiction or even just opioid addiction and co-caine addiction; let’s open it up to peo-ple who have substance abuse addic-tion—it can be alcohol, it can be crys-tal meth, which is unfortunately grow-ing in some of our States, and it can be opioids. So we broadened it for individ-uals with substance abuse disorders. We have said, these institutions need to provide the best possible treatment, medication-assisted treatment. Through this legislative effort that is going to be voted on here tomorrow, we have been able to open up a whole

other possibility for people who are ad-dicted. It is something we have worked on for many years. It is important we expand these serv-ices. It is important we tell people: If you are ready, we are going to find a treatment center for you—because we want these people to get better. We are told most people who are ad-dicted don’t seek treatment—probably 8 out of 10 don’t. One of the tricks is how do you get these people into treat-ment and into treatment in a way that is comprehensive where there are not big gaps. So between the overdose and the Narcan being applied, you want to be sure there is not a gap before treat-ment because people go back to their old community and, unfortunately, there are too many cases of people overdosing again and again. So get them into treatment but then from treatment into longer term recovery. We have to smooth that gap out so peo-ple are handed off to a facility or to an outpatient program that can help them ensure a greater level of success. Then how do you have this ability to say to people, ‘‘We are going to be there for you,’’ because, unfortunately, particularly with this opioid addiction, all the evidence coming in shows that long-term care really helps. Again, Congress has already taken some steps in the last couple of years with the Cures Act and the Comprehen-sive Addiction and Recovery Act, the so-called CARA legislation. There is more going on in our States. I visited about a dozen different places in our State where they are tak-ing advantage of the funding from the Comprehensive Addiction and Recov-ery Act, legislation I coauthored a cou-ple years ago with Senator W
HITEHOUSE  on the other side. It is starting to work. It is closing some of the gaps we are talking about. The Cures legislation goes right back to the States. Last year, Ohio got about $26 million for that. It is very helpful for us because we are struggling to provide enough resources for treat-ment, particularly. Then now we have this additional bill to build on CARA and Cures. I think over time this will have the effect of reversing what we have seen as a terrible and deadly trend, which is more and more Americans overdosing, dying, not being in the workplace, not being with their families, and not being productive citizens. This is something that affects every single one of us. If you go to your hospital, you will see that the emergency room is over-burdened. If you go to your NICU unit where these babies are being born who are addicted, babies who have neonatal abstinence syndrome—these babies can fit in the palm of your hand or your two palms—and they have to be taken through withdrawal. How sad that in-nocent babies have to be taken through withdrawal because they were born to a mother who was using and who was addicted. These are all things that must be ad-dressed and can be. Again, our legisla-tion is going to help do that. I will say, as much progress as we are making on education, treatment, re-covery, and with our first responders helping, as long as you have this dead-ly poison coming in, this fentanyl, the synthetic opioid that is 50 times more powerful than heroin and relatively in-expensive because it is being made by some evil scientist somewhere out of synthetics, out of chemicals—as long as you have that overwhelming the system, it is hard to see us reversing the trend. That is why the STOP Act is so important. We also reauthorized the HIDTA Pro-gram for high intensity drug traf-ficking areas. We need to push back on the supply side. We need to do more in terms of the demand side. With that, I will predict that when all of this is im-plemented properly, we will see some hope at the end of this dark tunnel. We will see fewer funerals like the one I was at yesterday. Instead, what we will see are families beginning to come back together, peo-ple beginning to have the opportunity to achieve their God-given potential in life, whatever it is. God’s purpose for these addicts certainly isn’t to con-tinue to be an addict. His purpose is for them to have a meaningful life also, as well as for all of us. It is in all of our interests. My hope is, we can pass this legisla-tion tomorrow, get it to the President, he will sign it, get it out to our States and communities, and begin to make the difference that can indeed begin to reverse this terrible epidemic and re-verse the tide.

FAA REAUTHORIZATION  
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I am here this afternoon to address two pieces of legislation that are coming before the Senate. One we are cur-rently waiting to consider is a long- term reauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration, and the sec-ond, which I hope we will soon con-sider, is comprehensive legislation to address the Nation’s opioid epidemic. I begin by thanking Chairman T
HUNE  and Ranking Member N
ELSON for their work to deliver a bipartisan, bicameral FAA reauthorization bill that provides a 5-year reauthorization for the agen-cy. The last time we reauthorized the FAA, when I was in the Senate, I think it took us 23 tries to get it done over a period of time that was actually longer than the original authorization, but this time we are doing it much faster, with three short-term extensions. Last week, the House passed this bill, the FAA reauthorization, with broad bipar-tisan support, and I hope the Senate is going to act quickly so we can get this bill to the President’s desk for signa-ture. The FAA has not received a long- term reauthorization since February of 2012. Short-term reauthorizations fail to give the FAA the certainty and the necessary resources they need to make to improve our Nation’s airports and make commercial air travel safer for all passengers. I think it is particularly an issue right now as we are switching over to the NextGen system of air traffic con-trol. Last month, I had a chance to visit with air traffic controllers in New Hampshire at the Terminal Radar Ap-proach Control Facility in Merrimack, also called the TRACON. What I heard from folks there was that a long-term reauthorization bill means that the TRACON and Merrimack will be able to upgrade its systems to keep our air-ways safe, while also allowing the cen-ter to continue to hire well-qualified, trained controllers to meet staffing needs. The bill we have before us now pro-vides critical investments through the Airport Improvement Program that provides grants to airports nationwide for planning and development projects that these airports would be unable to complete otherwise. In New Hampshire, where we have a number of small air-ports, this grant program is particu-larly important. It also increases investments in the Essential Air Service Program, which provides services that would otherwise be too cost prohibitive for airlines to operate in rural communities like we have in New Hampshire. For example, EAS is vital for Granite Staters who utilize the Lebanon Municipal Airport and depend on this service for access to regularly scheduled flights that would not otherwise be available. I am sure the Presiding Officer has an apprecia-tion for the Lebanon Municipal Air-port, since he went to school at Dart-mouth in that region of the State and knows how important that airport is to New Hampshire. I am also pleased the FAA bill in-cludes legislation I introduced as part of it to permanently reauthorize the Human Intervention Motivation Study, the HIMS Program, and also directs the National Research Council to study how other subagencies within the De-partment of Transportation could cre-ate similar programs to fight drug and alcohol addiction within their workforces. HIMS, as it is known, is an employee assistance program that provides edu-cation and outreach in order to coordi-nate the identification, treatment,

medical recertification, and return to the cockpit of flight officers with sub-stance misuse issues. HIMS doesn’t provide direct treatment but instead helps identify those who are in need, and it facilitates the successful return to work. It is an industrywide effort in which airlines, pilot unions, and the FAA work together to preserve careers and promote air safety. Since its im-plementation, the program has success-fully helped over 5,800 pilots, and it provides airlines with a $9 return on every dollar that is invested. There are a lot of lessons from the HIMS Program that I think have real resonance to other agencies within the Department of Transportation, and I am hoping the study that is authorized as part of the FAA bill we are consid-ering will be able to be shared so we can see how other agencies can also benefit from this. Right now, we have a 1-week exten-sion on the FAA bill that expires this Sunday, October 7. I hope this bill is going to come to the floor for final pas-sage before we go home this week. 
OPIOID EPIDEMIC  
Mr. President, second, I also want to point out that I hope the Senate will be moving soon to advance the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, which is comprehensive legislation to address the opioid epidemic. It is legis-lation that is the product of real bipar-tisan collaboration, not only within multiple committees within the Senate but multiple committees within both Chambers of Congress. It really shows we can work together across the aisle to help combat a crisis that has such a devastating impact on so many of our communities across the country. In my State of New Hampshire, where we have been particularly devastated, we have the second highest rate of over-dose deaths from opioids of any State in the country. What I have heard from Granite Staters time and again is that local providers and communities need more resources and flexibility to expand ac-cess to opioid treatment and preven-tion. This legislation responds to that call for action. I am proud to have worked with Sen-ator H
ASSAN and Senators from across the aisle to ensure that this bill in-cludes a reauthorization of the State opioid response grants, with the inclu-sion of the set-aside funding pool for States like New Hampshire that have been hardest hit by the epidemic. I am also pleased that the bill in-cludes provisions of legislation I co-sponsored with Senator C
OLLINS to pro-vide technical assistance and resources to peer recovery support networks. These networks play a vital role in a patient’s successful recovery. The bill extends flexibility for physi-cians and other practitioners who are seeking to expand access to medica-tion-assisted treatment, or MAT. En-suring that more patients can receive MAT services is critical to stemming the tide of the opioid epidemic. The bill provides a variety of im-provements to prescription drug moni-toring programs, which has been a pri-ority for New Hampshire. It includes a number of provisions that will improve the ability of Federal, State, and local law enforcement to reduce the illicit distribution of opioids and interdict particularly deadly synthetics like fentanyl, which is really the source of so many overdose deaths across the country. The legislation reauthorizes critical law enforcement programs that work to combat drug trafficking, including the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas Program, HIDTA. I had an oppor-tunity in January to visit the New England HIDTA Program headquarters in Massachusetts, and I saw firsthand the work they are doing to combat the flow of illicit drugs. Finally, this opioid legislation pro-vides much needed focus on addressing the impact of the opioid epidemic on children and families. If we don’t get ahead of this epidemic, we are going to see another generation of children who are going to be lost because of what has happened in their families because of substance abuse disorders. This bill will help pregnant women with substance use disorders access the maternity care they need. It has pro-grams that will give families better op-tions for treating opioid withdrawal in newborns, programs like Moms in Re-covery that Dartmouth-Hitchcock does so well in New Hampshire. What we are seeing in some hospitals in New Hamp-shire is that as much as 10-percent of babies are born with neonatal absti-nence syndrome, or NAS, caused by their mothers using opioids while they were pregnant. The bill will also help spur new family-focused interventions for parents struggling with opioid use disorders so that fewer kids will be raised in foster care. In sum, the policies included in this bipartisan legislation will go a long way toward helping us fight the opioid epidemic. We will need to continue to focus Federal resources on this crisis in the years to come. This is an impor-tant step forward in making sure at the Federal level that we are working with States and communities to ad-dress this multifaceted public health challenge. If we all work together, we can help end the devastation that is being caused by opioids. I look forward to joining all of our colleagues in sup-porting this bill soon. At this point, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. F LAKE ). The Senator from Idaho. 
RECOGNIZING MICRON TECHNOLOGY  
Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself and my good friend and colleague, also from Idaho, Senator C
RAPO , and we wish to honor an exceptional business from our great State. That business is Micron Tech-nology. Although Micron began in Idaho with just four employees, it will celebrate its 40th anniversary this week as one of the world’s top tech companies, with thousands of employees worldwide. Micron started as a semiconductor design company in the basement of a Boise dental office in 1978. Soon after it broke ground on its first fabrication plant in 1980, Micron introduced the world to the smallest 256K dynamic random access memory. By 1994, Mi-cron’s development of solid state drives and other flash memory technology in its product portfolio earned it a spot on the Fortune 500 list. Today, Micron’s team of more than 34,000 employees spans the globe from Boise, Silicon Valley, and Virginia, to Singapore, Taiwan, Japan, and Europe. As one of the top four semiconductor companies in the world, Micron works with the world’s most trusted brands and is the only pure play memory com-pany headquartered in the Western Hemisphere. Throughout its 40-year history, Micron has contributed to more than 40,000 patents and continues to advance memory and storage tech-nologies that enable innovations in ar-tificial intelligence, machine learning, and autonomous vehicles. Micron’s ad-vancements have made the United States a leader in technology and give the Nation a competitive edge in data storage, security, and supercomputing. In addition to its renowned techno-logical developments, I am proud that Micron is working to transform the communities where its team members live and work, providing resources to educate the next generation of sci-entists, inventors, and engineers. In 2017, Micron was ranked 23rd in the Fortune Just 100, Forbes’ list of companies with the best and most just business behavior. Last year, the Micron Foundation awarded more than 550 grants world-wide and donated more than $10 million to education and community-related causes. I wish to congratulate Micron on its long list of accomplishments and thank the company for the opportunities it provides for Idahoans and for all Amer-icans. The advances Micron’s solutions provide for computing across our coun-try are considerable. It is my pleasure to recognize its 40th anniversary on Oc-tober 5, 2018. We all wish Micron the best of luck and continued success as a global technology leader and world- class semiconductor company. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES6436 October 2, 2018 
people will die today, and 11 people will die tomorrow from a drug overdose. We have a long way to go to fight this, but right now, we are taking an important step to get resources to communities, doing innovative work, and tearing down the redtape regulations that pre-vent people from getting treatment. This week we will pass a comprehen-sive package of legislation to fight ad-diction. Several of these bills are im-portant to Ohio. I worked with my Republican col-league from West Virginia, Senator C
APITO , on a bipartisan CRIB Act to support treatment centers for babies with neonatal abstinence syndrome, like Brigid’s Path in Dayton, Lily’s Place in Huntington that serves people across the river in Lawrence County, OH, and elsewhere. Brigid’s Path in Ohio is one of just two residential treatment centers like this in the country. Again, Huntington, WV, on the Ohio River, across the river from Ohio, and Brigid’s Path in Dayton are the only two of these in the coun-try. I am meeting in my office tomorrow with folks from Brigid’s Path to talk with them about the important work they are doing in our State. NAS is caused by the use of opioids or other addictive substances during pregnancy. It has become a growing challenge for families and healthcare providers in States like Ohio. Recent studies show that cases of NAS have tripled over the past decade. Right now, babies are usually treated in the neonatal intensive care unit, known as NICUs—the neonatal inten-sive care unit—where treatment costs are five times the cost of treating other newborns, but given the relative bright lights and the relative loud noises in neonatal units, the NICU is not always the best place for newborns struggling with withdrawal. They are even more sensitive to noise and light than other premature babies that might be in a NICU. Residential pediatric recovery facili-ties like Brigid’s Path can give these infants specialized care as well as bringing the mothers and the families in for counseling in a setting outside the chaos of a hospital. So while they are treating the newborn baby, they also have opportunities with some wraparound services to treat the ad-dicted mothers so mother and child and others in the family can have a normal, healthy life. These unique venues are relatively new. The CRIB Act will allow them to bill Medicaid for the services they offer. The CRIB Act, Brigid’s Path in Dayton, OH, and the Huntington pro-gram are not eligible for Medicaid be-cause they are neither a doctor nor a hospital. So this bill will make them eligible for Medicaid and will save mil-lions of dollars. As more of these facili-ties like Brigid’s Path and Lily’s Place are formed around the country, we will be saving millions and millions of Med-icaid dollars. Instead of going to the more expensive, less-effective neonatal intensive care unit, they are going to Brigid’s Path and other places like that. As I said, the CRIB Act will allow them to bill Medicaid for their serv-ices, expanding options for care for the thousands of babies who need special-ized treatment. Unfortunately, thou-sands of babies are born to addicted mothers. This package will also do some other things that matter. It will lift the cap on the number of beds at Medicaid- funded treatment facilities for 5 years, something Senator P
ORTMAN and I have worked on for a long time. My colleague from Ohio, in the opposite party from me, has been working on opioid issues for some time, and this is one of the issues on which we worked together. The bill includes Senator P
ORTMAN ’s STOP Act that I supported and that will work with my INTERDICT Act that Senator P
ORTMAN and others sup-ported, that was signed into law by the White House several months ago, that will help keep illegal fentanyl, a syn-thetic substance much more toxic and powerful than heroin, and something called carfentanil off the streets. We know we have more work to do to fight this crisis. We need more re-sources in our communities in Ohio. This package is a bipartisan step for-ward. I hope we can get this to the President’s desk and signed into law soon. One sort of editorial comment also. I was a fairly young kid when I first started hearing about this, and we all know about this. In the mid-1960s—a huge number of Americans smoked to-bacco—the U.S. Surgeon General first brought to the public’s attention that smoking caused people’s life expect-ancy, lifespans, to be considerably shorter because of all the illnesses coming from smoking. In one of the great success stories in public health in the last half century, the Federal Gov-ernment worked together with local health officials, physicians, nurses, hospitals, cancer societies, the Amer-ican Heart Association, and others— starting with warnings on cigarette packs and all the things we do now— and the rate of smoking in this country considerably dropped from what it was in the mid-1960s. Our country, led by the Federal Gov-ernment in many cases—and people can say what they want about the govern-ment, but the Federal Government led the way on tobacco, on that public health initiative against tobacco. We can help lead the way, and we can work with local communities in addressing this terrible public health affliction of opioid addiction. It will matter to the next many generations if we do this right. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

CHICAGO HEAL INITIATIVE Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, one of the clearest indicators of the success or failure of any public health system is average life expectancy. Between the United States and other countries around the world, there are dramatic differences in life expectancy compared to the United States. But you don’t have to fly thousands of miles to see a place where people live sicker and die younger than their neighbors. In Chicago, hop on the Blue Line and go from the Loop to the ‘‘L’’ stop in West Garfield Park. Between those two neighborhoods—just 5 miles apart—life expectancy plummets 16 years. How can that possibly be? Chicago is home to some of the great-est hospitals in the world. The best doctors, the best nurses, the best tech-nology—it is all there, but not for them. As it turns out, how healthy we are and how long we live depends more on our ZIP Code than our genetic code. While countries overseas face chal-lenges with infectious disease or high child mortality rates, children in Chi-cago are dying preventable deaths of another form: an epidemic of gun vio-lence. Yes, we need better gun laws, but the reality is that this Congress and this President do not want to take commonsense action. So what else can be done to address the root causes of violence? Last year I introduced a bill that would increase funding to train more teachers, doctors, and social service providers to identify and provide care to children with emotional scars left from witnessing violence and exposure to other adverse childhood experiences. Major parts of this bill were included in the opioid package that already passed the House and I hope will pass the Senate soon. But I asked myself: What else can we do? Then it hit me: hospitals. The hospitals in Chicago are on the frontlines of the city’s gun violence epidemic, providing high-quality care to heal bodies ripped apart by bullets, but the ability of hospitals to reduce violence in Chicago goes far beyond the extraordinary, lifesaving care they pro-vide in the ER. Hospitals in Cook County, IL, pump $49 billion a year into the local econ-omy, and they employ 232,000 people. Hospitals are often the largest employ-ers in their communities. For several months, I brought to-gether the CEOs of the 10 largest hos-pitals serving the city of Chicago. I asked them three questions: What is your hospital is doing to make your neighborhoods safer and better? What more can you do? And how can I help? We identified a number of Chicago neighborhoods that they serve—or are

too often underserved—to focus our ef-forts. Remember, these institutions com-pete with each other every day, but to-gether, we came up with unified road-map—a set of common goals and com-mitments that are endorsed by all 10 hospitals. Over the next 3 years, these 10 hos-pitals will expand economic opportuni-ties for local residents by: increasing local hiring by 15 percent—that means hundreds, or thousands, of new local hires; increasing the goods they pur-chase from local businesses by 20 per-cent—meaning millions in procure-ment dollars; and expanding summer employment, internships, and job training programs for residents in health fields. The 10 hospitals are committing to opening new health clinics in schools and community centers and expanding the availability of mental health serv-ices. They will enhance their clinical healthcare practices by increasing lead screening rates by 15 percent, reducing opioid prescribing by 20 percent, prioritizing maternal and infant health outcomes, and researching gun vio-lence. This new hospital-led effort is fo-cused on two things: reducing gun vio-lence and healthcare inequality. It is called the Chicago HEAL Initiative: ‘‘Hospital Engagement, Action and Leadership.’’ According to the American Hospital Association, it may be the first such regional hospital partnership to tackle a local issue. The hospitals in the Chi-cago HEAL Initiative are already working on many these goals through an impressive variety of programs, but this new initiative will drive real change by bringing a new sense of part-nership and focusing on activities out-side of hospitals’ traditional services within their four walls. I am pleased to launch this new ef-fort, and will do whatever I can in Washington to help reduce violence and uplift communities.

160TH ANNIVERSARY OF YWCA Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I wish to congratulate the YWCA for its dedi-cation to supporting women, girls, and their families in honor of the organiza-tion’s 160th anniversary. YWCA is one of the oldest, largest, and most inclusive organizations in our Nation, and it has maintained a long history of distinguished service. The organization has been the forefront at some of the most important social movements of our time, from civil rights and women’s equality, to healthcare reform and gender-based vi-olence prevention. Nationwide, YWCA has 210 local asso-ciations across 47 States and the Dis-trict of Columbia that help to empower 2 million women, girls, and their fami-lies each year. In my home State of Washington, there are 11 YWCA local associations, all of which have been proudly serving women and girls for over 60 years. These YWCAs protect and empower hundreds of thousands of Washingtonian women and children each year, and I am grateful for their work. YWCA is the largest network of do-mestic violence service providers in our Nation and provides critical serv-ices to more than half a million women and girls each year, including support programs for survivors of sexual as-sault and domestic violence. Now, more than ever, this is vital to ensuring the safety and well-being of survivors across the country. Additionally, YWCA associations offer economic em-powerment programs that engage over 260,000 women and racial justice edu-cation and training programs that en-gage over 160,000 people. I stand today in strong support of YWCA’s mission to eliminate racism, empower women, stand up for social justice, promote peace, help families, and strengthen local communities. I offer congratulations to YWCA on your 160 years of improving the lives of women and girls across the United States. Thank you. Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate the YWCA for 160 years of service dedicated to sup-porting women, girls, and their fami-lies across the United States. Throughout its storied history, YWCA has been committed to elimi-nating racism, empowering women, and freedom and dignity for all. YWCA has been at the forefront of many critical social movements, in-cluding civil rights, women’s empower-ment, gender-based violence preven-tion, and more. Additionally, it is the largest network of domestic violence and sexual assault service providers in the country, reaching more than half a million women and girls annually. Serving a total of more than 2 mil-lion women, girls, and their families each year, with 210 local associations across 46 States and the District of Co-lumbia, this organization’s impact is vast, but its focus is local. In Ohio, there are 14 YWCA associa-tions, and I am proud of the work they do in my State. I have worked to help YWCA’s important mission through my legislation to combat sex trafficking, help those gripped by addiction—par-ticularly mothers and children—get the care they need, improve prisoner reentry, allow kids aging out of foster care to more easily access Federal sup-port for housing, and more. YWCA breaks barriers and empowers women to help them live up to their God-given potential. Congratulations on your 160 years of improving the lives of women and girls—and on many more to come.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: (1) Since 2008, incidents of murder, other violent crime, and corruption perpetrated by criminal networks, armed gangs and groups, and illicit trafficking organizations have re-mained at alarmingly levels in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. (2) In 2017, El Salvador and Honduras— (A) continued to be among the most vio-lent countries in Latin America and the world, with 60 and 42 murders for every 100,000 people, respectively; and (B) were characterized by a high preva-lence of gang-related violence and crimes in-volving sexual and gender-based violence. (3) El Salvador and Honduras are both among the top 3 countries in the world with the highest child homicide rates, with more than 22 and 32 deaths per 100,000 children re-spectively, according to the nongovern-mental organization Save the Children. (4) A November 2017 report by the United Nations Development Programme and UN Women stated that femicide ‘‘is taking on a devastating magnitude and trend in Central America, where 2 in every 3 women mur-dered, are killed because of their gender.’’. (5) Since 2014, elevated numbers of unac-companied minors, women, and other vulner-able individuals have fled violence in Central America’s Northern Triangle and left for the United States in search of protection. (6) Unaccompanied minors emigrating from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras cite violence, forced gang recruitment, ex-tortion, poverty, and lack of opportunity as reasons for leaving their home countries. (7) Challenges to the rule of law in the Northern Triangle continue to be exacer-bated by high levels of impunity related to murders and violent crime. In 2015, approxi-mately 95 percent of murders taking place in Honduras and El Salvador remained unre-solved. (8) The presence of major drug trafficking organizations in the Northern Triangle con-tributes to violence, corruption, and crimi-nality. According to the Department of State’s 2017 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras continue to be transit coun-tries for illicit drugs originating from coun-tries in South America that are destined for the United States. (9) In June 2018, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights found that in El Salvador, a pattern of behavior among security personnel and weak institutional responses may have re-sulted in extrajudicial executions and exces-sive use of force, with official figures indi-cating an alarming increase in the number of persons (alleged gang-members) who have been killed by security personnel. (10) Widespread public sector corruption in the Northern Triangle undermines economic and social development and directly affects regional political stability. (11) Human rights defenders, journalists, trade unionists, social leaders, and LGBT ac-tivists in the Northern Triangle face dire conditions, as evidenced by— (A) the March 2016 murder of the promi-nent Honduran environmental activist, Berta Caceres; and (B) the ongoing targeted killing of civil so-ciety leaders in all 3 countries in the North-ern Triangle. (12) The Northern Triangle struggles with high levels of economic insecurity. In 2016, 60.9 percent of Hondurans and 38 percent of Salvadorans lived below the poverty line. In 2014, 59.3 percent of Guatemalans lived below the poverty line. (13) Weak investment climates, low levels of tax collection, and low levels of edu-cational opportunity are barriers to inclu-sive economic growth and social develop-ment in the Northern Triangle.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6441 October 2, 2018 
(14) In January 2018 and May 2018, the Trump Administration announced the termi-nation of Temporary Protected Status des-ignations for Honduras and El Salvador, re-spectively, which would affect more than 500,000 individuals and their United States citizen children who may have to return to dangerous conditions in those countries. (15) In a November 2017 letter to the De-partment of Homeland Security, then Sec-retary of State Rex Tillerson warned that as a result of ending Temporary Protected Sta-tus, the Governments of El Salvador and Honduras ‘‘may take retaliatory actions counter to our long-standing national secu-rity and economic interests like withdrawing their counternarcotics and anti-gang co-operation with the United States, reducing their willingness to accept the return of their deported citizens, or refraining from ef-forts to control illegal migration.’’.

It is the sense of Congress that— (1) United States support is necessary to address irregular migration by addressing the violence and humanitarian crisis in the Northern Triangle, which has resulted in the elevated numbers of Central American unac-companied children, women, and other refu-gees and migrants arriving at the South-western border of the United States; (2) the violence and humanitarian crisis is linked to the severe challenges posed by— (A) high rates of homicide, sexual and gen-der-based violence, and violent crime per-petrated by armed criminal actors, including drug trafficking organizations and criminal gangs, such as the MS-13 and 18th Street gangs; (B) endemic corruption carried out by or-ganized networks and the weak rule of law, including the limited institutional capacity of national police forces, public prosecutors, and court systems; and (C) the limited capabilities and lack of po-litical will on the part of Northern Triangle governments to establish the rule of law, guarantee security, and ensure the well- being of their citizens; (3) the United States must work with international partners— (A) to address the complicated conditions in the Northern Triangle that contribute to the violence and humanitarian crisis; and (B) to guarantee protections for vulnerable populations, particularly women and chil-dren, fleeing violence in the region; (4) the Plan of the Alliance for Prosperity in the Northern Triangle, which was devel-oped by the Governments of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, with the tech-nical assistance of the Inter-American De-velopment Bank, represents a comprehensive approach to address the complex situation in the Northern Triangle; (5) the United States Strategy for Engage-ment in Central America, as first developed by President Obama and Vice President Biden, provides important support for the Alliance for Prosperity and other United States national security priorities, including rule of law and anti-corruption initiatives; (6) the Trump Administration’s proposed cuts in United States foreign assistance for Central America for fiscal years 2018 and 2019, if implemented, would undermine the United States ability to work with the Gov-ernments of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras to address critical United States national security priorities and the factors driving migration to the United States; (7) the Trump Administration must reverse its decision to terminate the Temporary Pro-tected Status designations for El Salvador and Honduras in order to prevent negative consequences to United States foreign policy objectives; (8) the United States should partner with the Government of Mexico— (A) to strengthen Mexico’s internal asylum system; and (B) ensure that Mexico upholds inter-national and humanitarian standards; (9) combating corruption in the Northern Triangle must remain a critical priority and the United States must continue its public and financial support for the United Nation’s Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) and the Organization of American States’ Mission to Support the Fight Against Corruption and Impunity in Honduras (MACCIH) as part of this effort; (10) the Government of Guatemala should reverse its efforts— (A) to terminate CICIG’s mandate; and (B) to undermine the effectiveness of CICIG’s ongoing operations, including pro-hibiting the current CICIG Commissioner from entering the country; and (11) it is imperative for the United States to implement a multi-year strategy and sus-tain a long-term commitment to addressing the underlying factors causing Central Americans to flee their countries by strengthening citizen security, the rule of law, democratic governance, the protection of human rights, and inclusive economic growth in the Northern Triangle.

HONORING KRISTENE BLAKE 
HON. PAUL D. RYAN 
OF WISCONSIN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 2, 2018 Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, Kristene Blake’s passion for politics and public service dates back to her Villanova days, when she interned for her hometown rep-resentative, Adam H. Putnam of Florida. Adam had the good sense to hire Kristene full-time after she graduated. Beginning in 2011, Kristene served in senior roles in two speaker-ships over the course of nearly eight years. Both Speaker Boehner and I depended on Kristene’s unique ability to manage any situa-tion, and find a way to get things done. Kristene is the definition of a servant leader. She puts in the late hours and the unsung work it takes to make this institution function. She believes in doing the right things for the right reasons. These are virtues she is sure to pass on to her three beautiful children: Law-rence, Eloisa, and Amelia. The people’s House thanks Kristene for her years of dedi-cated service.

HONORING MISS AMERICA’S OUT-STANDING TEEN 2019—LONDON HIBBS OF TYLER, TEXAS 
HON. LOUIE GOHMERT 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 2, 2018 Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, Texas is blessed to have had some absolutely extraor-dinary, inspirational people who have accom-plished some manifestly phenomenal things. One of those extraordinary, inspirational indi-viduals who has already inspired a nation is London Hibbs of Tyler, Texas who, as Miss Texas’ Outstanding Teen, recently captured the prestigious title of Miss America’s Out-standing Teen 2019 in Orlando, Florida. London will have the remarkable opportunity to speak to audiences nationwide about her personal platform, ‘‘Check Yes 4 Life,’’ which encourages teen organ donation registration. The little sister program to Miss America, the Miss America’s Outstanding Teen Organi-zation is, one of the nation’s leading achieve-ment programs encouraging and nurturing scholastic achievement, creative accomplish-ment, healthy living, and community involve-ment of our nation’s youth. London’s academic and creative endeavors already reflect an unusual maturity, embodying the drive, dedication, and desire that marks exceptionally successful adults. She is an Honor Roll student, member of Mensa, gifted vocal soloist who has performed in Carnegie Hall, enthusiastic community volunteer, ac-complished actress, and is highly respected as a leader among her peers. As a result of London’s prestigious accom-plishment, she has been awarded more than $30,000 in scholarships, after securing prelimi-nary wins in both the Talent and the Evening Wear/Onstage Question portions of the com-petition. Every aspect of her life and her per-sona reflect well on all who have assisted her along the way. As she travels the country this year, all of us can look forward to the significant impact London will make on the thousands upon thousands of people she will meet as she in-spires them to reach for their dreams. It will be a great pleasure to watch her pur-sue and achieve her aspirations beyond the opportunities afforded her during this year of service as well, just as it has been a great honor for me personally to know, respect, and admire the entire Hibbs family. It is truly a distinct privilege to honor this ex-ceptional young lady, our reigning Miss Amer-ica’s Outstanding Teen 2019 London Hibbs, whose landmark accomplishments will endure as long as there is a United States of Amer-ica. f 
HONORING MR. JOHN GRIESHEIMER, ON HIS RETIRE-MENT AFTER 36 YEARS IN SERV-ICE TO THE CITIZENS OF FRANK-LIN COUNTY 
HON. BLAINE LUETKEMEYER 
OF MISSOURI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 2, 2018 Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a constituent of mine, Mr. John Griesheimer, on his retirement after 36 years in service to the citizens of Franklin County. Since 1982, Mr. Griesheimer has provided dedicated service to his community of Wash-ington, Missouri. It started with his representa-tion on the City Council in 1982 through 1988 before being elected as County Commissioner in 1989 and serving in that role until 1992. Those 4 years of service as a commissioner adequately prepared Mr. Griesheimer for his next elected official roles as State Representa-tive followed by the State Senate. For nearly 20 years he served in the Missouri Legislature and holds the title of being the first State Sen-ator from Washington, Missouri—what an honor! Once his term as State Senator was completed, Mr. Griesheimer continued his dedicated public service to Franklin County as Presiding Commissioner until July of this year. Throughout his commissioner and state elected official duties, Mr. Griesheimer was active in many community organizations: OATS Transit, Washington Lions Club, East- West Gateway Council of Governments, Mis-souri Association of Counties, Knights of Co-lumbus, Elks, Missouri Main Street Connec-tion, Washington Historical Society, and the Washington Bridge Committee. Each of these organizations have shared their great appre-ciation for the many hours Mr. Griesheimer has spent volunteering his time. With his numerous civic responsibilities, Mr. Griesheimer has seen major accomplishments over the years. In 1986, during his time on the City Council, the Washington City Pool Ren-ovations were completed. In 1997, as he served as Missouri State Representative, Am-trak installed a stop in Washington. Then in 2007, while he was a Missouri State Senator, he helped with the passage of the Enhanced Enterprise Zone Bill for Franklin County. This zoning bill paved the way for the building of the Menards Distribution Center in Sullivan, Missouri. In 2010 the Associated Industries of Missouri acknowledged his great work by pre-senting him with the Friend of Manufacturing and Industry Award. Of Mr. Griesheimer’s biggest supporters over the years are his wife, Rita and their three children. In his retirement, he will enjoy spending more time with his family. He will also continue his service on the statewide OATS Transportation Board and with the Washington Lions Club. Mr. Speaker, please join me in congratu-lating Mr. John Griesheimer on his retirement after 36 years in dedicated service to his hometown, county, and state. f 
HONORING THE COMMUNITY AC-TION BOARD OF SANTA CRUZ COUNTY 
HON. JIMMY PANETTA 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 2, 2018 Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Community Action Board of Santa Cruz County for fifty-two years of out-standing service to the central coast of Cali-fornia. Since its founding in 1966, CAB has provided advocacy, employment training, food assistance, and housing support to Santa Cruz County residents. Through CAB’s ‘‘ALCANCE’’ program, at- risk youth and adults re-entering the work force have a vital resource for job training and employment. CAB also operates the Day Worker Center of Santa Cruz County, an im-portant organization that helps day laborers secure safe employment, improve their skills, and earn higher wages. Together, these pro-grams result in good jobs that pay residents, enriching and enabling participatory engage-ment in our community. CAB’s Rental Assistance Program and CalWORKS Emergency Payment Program provide relief to residents struggling to meet the financial demands of housing, education, and employment. These programs help pro-vide the means for low-income, disabled, and elderly members of our community to live independently, remain employed, and continue providing for themselves and their families. I appreciate the long-standing and ever- growing commitment of the Community Action Board of Santa Cruz County to the welfare of our diverse constituency on the Central Coast. Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me

DR. BRUCE WEINER 
HON. KATHY CASTOR 
OF FLORIDA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 2, 2018 Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate a fellow Tampanian, Bruce Weiner, on his tenure as the national president of the prestigious American Associa-tion of Nurse Anesthetists (AANA) and honor his commitment to safe, quality anesthesia care for my neighbors and patients nation-wide. Bruce received his bachelor’s degree in Nursing from the University of Delaware, a master’s degree in Nurse Anesthesiology from the Medical College of Virginia and a Doctor of Nursing Practice from the University of South Florida in our hometown of Tampa. He has long been an active advocate for nurse anesthetists and the patients they serve. He has shared his expertise and passion by serv-ing on professional associations in many ca-pacities at the state and national levels, while continuing to provide clinical anesthesia serv-ices in Tampa Bay. Bruce participated as a guest lecturer at the University of South Flor-ida, and as a clinical instructor at Moffitt Can-cer Center in Tampa and served on AANA’s Board of Directors. During his AANA presidency, Bruce has been a prominent advocate for patients and the practice of nurse anesthesia before federal agencies and members of Congress. He has worked efficiently to promote anesthesia pa-tient safety and the value of Certified Reg-istered Nurse Anesthetists (CRNAs) to our health care system, especially when it comes to dealing with chronic pain and the opioid cri-sis. Bruce has worked to have CRNAs recog-nized as full practice providers in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) to maintain pro-vider non-discrimination and to achieve full scope of practice for CRNAs. On behalf of the citizens of Florida, my neighbors across Tampa Bay and CRNAs ev-erywhere, I would like to take this opportunity to thank Bruce Weiner for 34 years of service facilitating access to care to all patients.

OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 2, 2018 Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, I would like to wish all Taiwanese Americans and the people of Taiwan a very happy 107th National Day. Taiwan is an extraordinary friend of the United States, and it is important that we con-tinue to build upon our critical partnership eco-nomically, culturally, and politically. The United States is lucky to have an ally in Asia to fur-ther promote peace and stability in the region, and to serve as a strong example of democ-racy. Taiwan is also the United States’ 11th largest trading partner and has imported $3.57 billion in food and agricultural products. The state of California has deep and ever- growing ties with Taiwan. California exports over $7 billion worth of goods to Taiwan, which serves as its 5th largest export market in the world. The Greater Los Angeles region represents the largest Taiwanese community in the United States, and many have gone on to settle in the San Gabriel Valley providing our local communities with new traditions, em-ployment opportunities, and economic growth. With continued commitment to this important relationship, I am happy to recognize Taiwan’s 107th National Day and look forward to our many years of prosperous relations.

Presented on this 2nd day of October in the year of our Lord 2018. f 
IN HONOR OF THE PROMOTION OF COMMANDER JOHN M
CCARTHY TO THE RANK OF CAPTAIN IN THE UNITED STATES COAST GUARD 
HON. STEVE SCALISE 
OF LOUISIANA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 2, 2018 Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize John McCarthy as he is promoted to Captain in the United States Coast Guard. Captain McCarthy graduated from the United States Coast Guard Academy in 1997, and after two years of service aboard USCGC FORWARD, he received orders to flight school where he trained to be an HU–25 Falcon pilot. After four years of service, Captain McCarthy reported to Air Station Washington, D.C. as the Operations Officer. Following two years of service as the Military Aide to the President of the United States, Captain McCarthy served at Coast Guard Headquarters within the Office of Budget and Programs. In 2014, Captain McCarthy returned to the Aviation Community as Executive Officer of Air Station Wash-ington, D.C., and in 2017, I had the pleasure of welcoming him to my staff as a Legislative Fellow. During his time in my office, he has been a tremendous asset to our legislative team, and has represented the best of the USCG. I congratulate Captain McCarthy on his promotion within the United States Coast Guard and thank him for his twenty-plus years of service to our nation. This significant achievement distinguishes him as among the United States Coast Guard’s most trusted and capable senior leaders. f 
RECOGNITION OF TAIWAN’S NATIONAL DAY 
HON. MARK MEADOWS 
OF NORTH CAROLINA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 2, 2018 Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Taiwan’s National Independence Day, Double Ten Day. On October 10th, Tai-wan celebrates the 107th anniversary of the Republic of China. In the face of heightening regional tensions, the bond between the United States and Taiwan must remain strong. On the occasion of Taiwan’s National Day, I want to congratulate the people of Taiwan on this important anniversary and express the sincere commitment of our nation and this body to the bilateral relationship. Through commerce, our military partnership, and the ties between our citizens, the United States and the Republic of China (Taiwan) have built an alliance which I am confident can withstand any future threats, and to which I know the Trump administration is committed to preserving. I also want to take this moment to commend the Americans serving in the American Institute in Taiwan for their patriot-ism and hard work advancing this relationship. Furthermore, Beijing’s attempts to under-mine Taiwan’s participation in international fora, its bullying of private airlines over rec-ognition of Taiwan’s government, and its dis-ruption of Taiwan’s diplomatic ties should not go unmentioned. I believe the current adminis-tration has responded appropriately and that Washington will continue to make its views known. From its beginnings with the overthrow of imperial rule, to its embrace of a vibrant de-mocracy today, the Republic of China (Tai-wan) shares a bond with the United States founded on common principles. As Taiwan celebrates Double Ten Day, I extend my best wishes and congratulate the Taiwanese peo-ple for all they have achieved.

IN HONOR OF THE 150TH ANNIVER-SARY OF THE INCORPORATION OF THE CITY OF GREEN RIVER AND THE ARRIVAL OF THE TRANSCONTINENTAL RAILROAD 
HON. LIZ CHENEY 
OF WYOMING  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 2, 2018 Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to extend my congratulations to the City of Green River for the 150th Anniversary of the incorpo-ration of the City of Green River and the ar-rival of the Transcontinental Railroad. The City of Green River, Sweetwater Coun-ty Historical Museum, and the Green River Chamber of Commerce continue to proudly honor this great town’s history and achieve-ments, including Thomas Moran’s famous ‘‘First Sketch in the West.’’ Additionally, the Transcontinental Railroad played a pivotal role in not only the develop-ment of Green River but Wyoming as a whole. On May 10, 1869, the Union Pacific and Cen-tral Pacific Railroads were connected, creating the Transcontinental Railroad. The railroad brought great change to Wyoming and our na-tion alike. It opened new doors to economic opportunity, new trade markets, and even helped create the Wyoming Territory. In Gov-ernor John A. Campbell’s inaugural address to the Wyoming Territorial Legislature, he said, ‘‘For the first time in the history of our country, the organization of a territorial government was rendered necessary by the building of a railroad.’’ The Transcontinental Railroad was a historic achievement that continues to benefit the economy of our State to this day. Again, Mr. Speaker, I would like to extend my congratulations to the City of Green River for the 150th Anniversary of the incorporation of the City of Green River and recognize the historic significance of the arrival of the Trans-continental Railroad in Wyoming.

RECOGNITION OF NATIONAL DAY OF TAIWAN 
HON. ROB BISHOP 
OF UTAH  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 2, 2018 Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the National Day of Taiwan and its ongoing relationship with the United States. Relations between our two countries were cemented with the passage of the Tai-wan Relations Act (TRA) in 1979 and have flourished for nearly 30 years. Throughout the decades, Taiwan and the United States have continuously stood strong together against a number of challenges, while maintaining a steadfast commitment to one another’s mutual security and prosperity. This commitment was first enshrined in the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979 (TRA) and was supple-mented by the Six Assurances by President Ronald Reagan in 1982. The TRA and the Six Assurances form the foundation of America’s unshakable relationship with Taiwan and today, I would like to express my personal and continuing support for these pillars of our stra-tegic partnership. Our ongoing commitment to cooperation also extends into the areas of trade and eco-nomics. In 2017, Taiwan was ranked as the 11th largest trading partner of the United States, the 11th largest U.S. export market and the 7th largest market for U.S. agricultural products. Taiwan has imported $3.57 billion of food and agricultural products from the U.S. representing more than 28 percent of total im-ports of those products. Taiwan also regularly sponsors trade mis-sions to the United States in pursuit of agricul-tural products. Last year, these missions cul-minated in the signing of letters of intent to purchase approximately $2.8 billion in U.S.- produced grains between 2018 and 2019. Similar missions are organized by the U.S. Commercial Service to assist U.S. companies in identifying opportunities in Taiwan. One such mission was recently organized in con-junction with the World Trade Center of Utah and led by Governor Gary Herbert to assist Utah-based companies, and other Western states, to network in Taiwan. I will continue to seek avenues where we can work together to further promote not only Utah-Taiwan rela-tions, but U.S.-Taiwan relations in general. I hope my colleagues will join me in promoting this cooperation wherever possible. Once again, I am proud to recognize Tai-wan’s National Day, and look forward to many years of friendly and prosperous relations be-tween our two nations. f

Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Jane Brown M.Ed., Executive Director of Child Care Resources of Rockland (CCRR), as she celebrates her retirement at A Benefit for the Child Care Tuition Scholarship Program on Wednesday, October 3, 2018. Mrs. Brown has long been an educator, having taught a variety of age ranges, includ-ing school-aged, preschool, toddlers, and even infants, for more than 40 years. She has served as Executive Director since 2004 and in various other positions at CCRR for 13 years prior. Mrs. Brown also serves on several boards and advisory committees. She formerly served as the Co-President of the New York State Association for the Education of Young Children and President of the New York State Early Care and Learning Council. Mrs. Brown was recognized as a 2012 Woman of Distinc-tion, Honoring Women in New York. In addition to working hands-on with the children, Mrs. Brown has led professional de-velopment for numerous home-based staff and early childhood development centers. She worked with staff on developing stronger cur-riculums, interacting with children and families, enhancing the learning environment and help-ing teachers deal with the stress commonly experienced in the early childhood industry. Mrs. Brown has also taught courses at the B.A. and M.A. level and given local, state- wide, and national presentations on early childhood education. Mr. Speaker, I urge my fellow Members of Congress to join me in expressing thanks to Mrs. Brown for her 27 years of outstanding service, dedication, and passion to Child Care Services of Rockland and to the children and families of Rockland County and beyond. f 
CONGRATULATING JOHN HERNDON ON HIS RETIREMENT 
HON. PETE OLSON 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 2, 2018 Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, as a former Naval aviator, I rise today to congratulate a Navy veteran and longtime federal employee, John Herndon, on his retirement. John is retiring from his position as a FG– 14 Program Manager in the Department of Transportation Federal Aviation Administration. He served a total of 37 years, four months, and seventeen days in the federal workforce. After serving in the Navy for 20 years, six months and six days and deploying worldwide in support of reconnaissance squadrons, John retired as Maintenance Chief. His work serving our country both in and out of uniform de-serves our utmost respect and gratitude. On behalf of the Twenty-Second Congres-sional District of Texas, congratulations again to Mr. John Herndon. May he have fair winds and following seas in his retirement.

a grocery store. The shop has seen multiple identity changes but has remained in the own-ership of the Elder family throughout the dec-ades. After operating as a grocery store, it transitioned into a bar. In the 1985, the Elders remodeled the bar into a barn, selling local produce and hosting dances in the community. Over time, the produce barn slowly trans-formed into Elders Mini Mart. It remained in operation until its closing on October 1, 2018. Elders Mini Mart has been in the ownership of the Elder Family since its founding. Lon and Bertha Elder passed down management re-sponsibilities to Fred and Laura Elder, who then gave ownership to Ray and Pat Elder. When Ray sadly passed away in 2011, Pat maintained ownership of the store. Elders Mini Mart has become a fixture in the Caruthers community. It is widely known for being the choice of farmers for their morning coffee and children would often get free ice cream at the end of a school day. The Mart has a reputation for having the best deli in town. Aside from being a popular meeting place for farmers and students, Elder Mini Mart has also historically supported the local Central Valley agriculture industry through sell-ing local produce. It never went to waste; unsold fruits and vegetables being fed to their livestock. Located off the 41, Elders Mini Mart gets customers from around the state, country, and world. Travelers stop at the store for a quick break, and unexpectedly find a warm atmos-phere with a friendly owner and delicious food. If anything defines Elders Mini Mart aside from its rich history, it would be their ability to make all customers feel like part of the community. Their customer service was unmatched. Pat Elder has been the sole owner since her husband Ray passed away. While effec-tively managing the store for years, she has decided the time has come to retire. She is ready to transition into the next phase of her life and is excited to have the opportunity to travel. After decades of hard work and service to Caruthers, she deserves a restful retirement with many exciting adventures. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the United States House of Representatives to join me in commending Elders Mini Mart for ninety-eight years of operation and wishing Mrs. Pat Elder well in her retirement.

COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORTATION AND  I

EAR CHAIRMAN BISHOP : On June 27, 2018, the Committee on Transportation and Infra-structure ordered reported with amendment S. 756, the Save Our Seas Act of 2017. The bill was referred primarily to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, with an additional referral to the Committee on Nat-ural Resources. I ask that you allow the Committee on Natural Resources to be discharged from fur-ther consideration of the bill so that it may be scheduled by the Majority Leader. This discharge in no way affects your jurisdiction over the subject matter of the bill, and it will not serve as precedent for future refer-rals. In addition, should a conference on the bill be necessary, I would support your re-quest to have the Committee on Natural Re-sources represented on the conference com-mittee. Finally, I would be pleased to in-clude this letter and any response in the bill report filed by the Committee on Transpor-tation and Infrastructure, as well as in the Congressional Record during floor consider-ation, to memorialize our understanding. Thank you for your consideration of my request. Sincerely, BILLSHUSTER , Chairman.

In the interest of permitting you to pro-ceed expeditiously to floor consideration of this bill, I will agree to discharge the Nat-ural Resources Committee from further con-sideration of S. 756. I do so with the under-standing that the Natural Resources Com-mittee does not waive any future jurisdic-tional claim over the subject matter con-tained in the bill that fall within its Rule X jurisdiction. I also appreciate your support to name members of the Natural Resources Committee to any conference committee to consider such provisions and for inserting our exchange of letters on S. 756 into the Congressional Record during consideration of the measure on the House floor. Thank you once again for the very cooper-ative spirit in which you and your staff have worked regarding this matter and many oth-ers between our respective committees. Sincerely, R

REAUTHORIZING THE FAMILY VIO-LENCE PREVENTION AND SERV-ICES ACT 
SPEECH OF  
HON. GWEN MOORE 
OF WISCONSIN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, September 28, 2018 Ms. MOORE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the House’s action last Friday to pass legislation (H.R. 6014) to reauthorize the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act, FVPSA, a bill that was introduced with bipar-tisan support by Rep. G
LENN THOMPSON , my- self, and Reps. E
LISE STEFANIK and L ISA B
LUNT ROCHESTER . I am pleased that the House, on a bipartisan basis, was able to reach agreement and expedite passage of this key law. I again want to thank Rep. T
HOMP -
SON, Rep. S TEFANIK , and Rep. B LUNT ROCH-
ESTER for joining with me and their hard work in getting us to this moment. FVPSA, originally enacted in 1984, is at the heart of our nation’s response to domestic vio-lence, ensuring that local domestic violence shelters and programs are able to keep their lights on and doors open to serve more than 1.3 million victims and their children every year. FVPSA funds nearly hundreds of commu-nity-based programs. These programs provide emergency shelter, counseling, legal assist-ance, crisis intervention, and domestic and dating violence prevention education. FVPSA also provides funding for tribal governments to deliver essential services to survivors and sup-ports the National Domestic Violence Hotline, which is often the first call made by survivors. H.R. 6014 would simply extend the current programs at current funding levels through FY 2023. It’s critical to remember that the most dan-gerous moment for women experiencing inti-mate partner violence is that point in time when they decide to do something about their situation, and that is the point in which there has just got to be a resource there. That is what the programs and funding through FVPSA helps to provide. Mr. Speaker, recent high-profile cases have brought a national focus on domestic violence, but such violence isn’t limited to Hollywood. The #MeToo movement has given all sur-vivors a renewed courage to come forward for help. I cannot underscore enough that it is crit-ical that Congress act to ensure that the re-sources and supports are in place to help them when they do. Passing FVPSA is a good step forward. In that vein, I hope my colleagues will take the next step and bring VAWA reauthorization legislation (H.R. 6545), introduced by Rep. SHEILA JACKSON LEEand myself and over 170 of our colleagues, that would strengthen and improve those critical programs, to the floor as quickly as possible. No more needless delay. I applaud colleagues on both sides for their work to help move this commonsense and noncontroversial bill out of the House last Fri-day. While we can’t end every single act of vi-olence, we must help create the space and the opportunity for these victims to be able to come forward and to leave these situations. I hope that the Senate will act expeditiously to send this bill to the President’s desk for sig-nature into law.

TIFFANY JOSLYN JUVENILE AC-COUNTABILITY BLOCK GRANT PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2017

OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, September 28, 2018 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that the House of Representatives has passed H.R. 68, the ‘‘Tiffany Joslyn Juve-nile Accountability Block Grant Reauthorization and the Bullying Prevention and Intervention Act.’’ Passage of H.R. 68 came about as a result of hard and great teamwork amongst our amazing staff on both sides of the aisle. I am heartened by the work done on this bill along with the other four bills up for unanimous con-sent. I commend Chairman G

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD —Extensions of RemarksE1357 October 2, 2018 
This bill is named for Tiffany May Joslyn, a champion for criminal justice reform, who served as my Deputy Chief Counsel of the Crime Subcommittee and whose life tragically was cut short on March 5, 2016, in a car acci-dent that sadly also claimed the life of her brother, Derrick. She was just 33 years old. So today’s passage of H.R. 68 is both bitter and sweet. Tiffany would have been proud, as she championed these causes. This moment is for both her and for all the millions of young people that will be helped by this bill. The Tiffany Joslyn bill will help stem the epi-demic of juveniles within the criminal justice system by reauthorizing the Juvenile Account-ability Block Grant program (JABG) and pro-viding funding to state and local governments for the creation of bullying and gang preven-tion programs. It will authorize such appropriations as may be necessary, which is anticipated to be at least $30 million per year. In addition to reauthorizing juvenile justice programs, the Tiffany Joslyn Juvenile Account-ability Block Grant Reauthorization and the Bullying Prevention and Intervention Act clari-fies how to address the occurrences of bul-lying through developmentally appropriate intervention and prevention techniques, which center on evidence-based models and best practices that rely on schools and commu-nities rather than involvement from law en-forcement and the justice system. H.R. 68 is designed to help both the victims and perpetrators of bullying. Research studies have shown that approximately 25 percent of school bullies will be convicted of a criminal offense in their adult years. It also includes provisions for gang preven-tion programs, which will help guide our chil-dren towards socially beneficial paths. If we want our children to learn, we must be able to maintain a safe and healthy school environ-ment. Bullying is a massive issue in our na-tion’s schools. The National Center for Educational Studies reports show that 14 percent of 12-to 18-year- olds surveyed report being victims of direct or indirect bullying. 1 out of 4 kids is bullied. Bullying is not just in a schoolyard anymore; it is a crisis that’s taking over our nation. Gone are the days that children can come home and seek solace and escape from their bullies; technological advances have made it easy for young people to be tormented on social net-works at any time from any place. They are never out of harm’s reach. This needs to end. Americans children should be protected, and no child should be persecuted for exercising their American right to be them-selves. It is time for us to come to a conclu-sive solution to America’s bullying crisis. My bill, H.R. 68, the Tiffany Joslyn Juvenile Accountability Block Grant Reauthorization and the Bullying Prevention and Intervention Act, provides the solution that we need. The work we do as Members to pass these bills cannot be done without the diligence and hard work of our talented and dedicated staff Counsels. This is why I would like to take the time to thank Monalisa Dugue, Deputy Chief Counsel of the Democratic Crime Sub-committee; and her colleagues Danielle Brown, Perry Apelbaum, and Joe Graupensperger of the Democratic staff. And I thank Branden Ritchie, Shelly Husband, Stephanie Gadbois, and Margaret Barr of the Republican staff for their fine work. Now I urge my colleagues in the Senate to adopt our effort in the House and pass H.R. 68, the Tiffany Joslyn Juvenile Accountability Block Grant Reauthorization and the Bullying Prevention and Intervention Act so that we may keep all of our children safe. This bill honors Tiffany, but more impor-tantly, it advances the cause of justice in America.

To the players and coaches, thank you for the hard work, de-termination, grit and talent that propelled you to the end and made us all so proud of Se-attle. To friends and families of the team, thank you for your support, encouragement and personal sacrifices. Seattle Storm, your achievement reflects not only the hard work that goes into winning a national championship, but also your resilience and dedication to one another throughout the entirety of the season. Every day, I feel hon-ored to represent women like you whose work shows a tremendous commitment to women’s issues, young girls and your community—a testimony of your connection to the City of Se-attle. It is no surprise that the majority of Se-attle’s championships belong to the Storm. Your team embodies the values that we, in our city, hold so dearly. You are an incredible role model for girls and women everywhere. It is an honor both to serve women like you who take a stand and speak out for issues that are important, but also to be able to call the Storm my home team. Again, I would like to extend my warmest congratulations to you all, and I look forward to seeing everything that you accomplish in the future.

ALVIN ISD ‘‘THE DAY’’ OF SERVICE 
HON. PETE OLSON 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 2, 2018 Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Superintendent James ‘‘Buck’’ Gilcrease and the Alvin Independent School District’s for hosting their ‘‘The Day’’ of Service project, held on September 8, 2018. ‘‘The Day’’ is a way for the entire student body and staff of Alvin ISD to show their grati-tude to the Alvin community. ‘‘The Day’’ is about coming together as a school district and expressing appreciation, but also working to instill a sense of service within the student body. During Hurricane Harvey, many students gave their time and talent to help folks in need. One year later, to recognize the anni-versary of Hurricane Harvey, the student body came together to make the community a bet-ter place for the first annual ‘‘The Day’’. This year, 20,000 students and staff members showed up to engage in a multitude of service projects. These projects included providing gift bags to first responders, washing cars for local police stations, picking up trash in neighbor-hoods, and holding roadside prayer. This is tremendous community spirit that deserves recognition. On behalf of the Twenty-Second Congres-sional District of Texas, thank you again to Superintendent Gilcrease, the staff and stu-dents at the Alvin Independent School District for their first annual ‘‘The Day’’ of Service. I thank them for their dedication to improving our Alvin community. f

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 2, 2018 Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the incredible work of the YWCA serving my district in New York City and simi-lar branches throughout the country. For over 160 years, YWCA has played a key role in empowering women by helping millions of women, girls, families and their communities all across the country. In Brooklyn, New York, YWCA has worked to help eliminate racism, violence and poverty. YWCA Brooklyn created 310 units of afford-able permanent housing for low-income women and homeless survivors of domestic violence. Taking a holistic approach to eradi-cating systemic poverty, YWCA’s services range from providing English language classes and legal assistance, college access and lead-ership development and employment readi-ness. It has also spearheaded a women’s business entrepreneurship mentoring program to help women lead startups. YWCA also of-fers wellness programing to reduce stress and trauma by offering yoga classes, art and music therapy. In addition, YWCA Brooklyn’s Social Justice Community Center provides free event and meeting space, training facilities and offices to over 100 nonprofit and community organiza-tions. In 2017 alone, YWCA Brooklyn partnered with over 100 community groups to offer 845 events drawing over 25,000 attendees. Mr. Speaker, for decades, YWCA has pro-vided a lifeline for countless women, children and families. It is with great respect and admi-ration that I salute the YWCA staff and com-munity for their tireless commitment to em-powerment and justice for all.

immigrants came together. The bakery was in-tended as a gathering place for the commu-nity, producing traditional Chinese pastries and cookies not found locally. Using generation-old recipes, the Chan fam-ily’s first bakery highlighted its almond cook-ies, which it sold to Chinese restaurants and stores. Founders Fung Chow (F.C.) Chan and his wife Waihing were proud to offer the treats to everyone. Soon thereafter, F.C.’s brother, Lun, joined the bakery, and the bakery’s offer-ings began to include what has become its trademark fresh strawberry whipped cream cake, consisting of two sponge layers with strawberries in between and covered with a fluffy, lightly sweetened whipped cream frost-ing. It was not until the 1970s, however, that Phoenix Bakery became famous throughout Los Angeles for being a little Chinese bakery making this ‘‘not so Chinese’’ cake. In 1977, with business flourishing, the Chan family moved from Chinatown’s Central Plaza to a custom-built bakery on North Broadway, where it remains today. Catering both to the local population cele-brating birthdays and to the thriving busi-nesses operating downtown, Phoenix Bakery cakes began to become traditions. Lun’s son, Youlen, eventually took over production, and Phoenix Bakery continued to thrive as he ex-panded the offerings of sweets and confec-tions. The almond cookies, Sticky Sugar But-terflies, and Wintermelon cakes it sells have made traditional Chinese pastries household favorites. Its selection of pastries also includes a blend of eclairs, tarts, and specialty cake slices made daily. Today, members of the Chan family’s third generation can be found in various roles at the bakery, alongside loyal employees who have helped the Phoenix Bakery family grow through the years. According to a July 14, 2018 Los Angeles Times article by reporter Frank Shyong, many of the Chans ‘‘have stepped up to help keep the bakery alive. Eric, a finance executive with Kaiser Permanente, serves on the bakery’s managing board and launched a review of its finances. Melissa, Lun’s granddaughter, runs the bakery’s Facebook and Instagram accounts. Tiffany, Fung Chow’s granddaughter, helped build the website and makes marketing suggestions. And Andrea Purcell, Fung Chow’s oldest granddaughter, now brings her son and daughter to help at the bakery.’’ Over the decades, Phoenix Bakery has brightened many birthdays, weddings, and celebrations. The bakery prides itself on main-taining a loyal following of customers, and it continues to welcome new friends with its quality, delicious products. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to please join me in celebrating the Phoenix Bakery’s 80th anniversary, and wishing it many more years of providing, in its words, ‘‘Sweets for the Sweet.’’

IN RECOGNITION OF BETSY COHN 
HON. CAROLYN B. MALONEY 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 2, 2018 Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Betsy Cohn, a leader and activist who has made a dif-ference on the national stage. Ms. Cohn has been an advertising and marketing executive, a stalwart of Democratic politics and an out-spoken feminist who has worked to elect women to office. On October 1, 2018, she celebrated her 80th birthday. Betsy Cohn has broken through glass ceil-ings and reached down for others to follow. She had an extraordinary career in marketing and public relations, starting in the Mad Men era when few women succeeded in becoming executives. She worked for some of the most iconic movie and television studios, heading departments and making significant contribu-tions to the entertainment industry. Born Betsy Levitt, Ms. Cohn attended Syra-cuse University. In 1959, she was hired as a secretary at Kenyon & Eckhardt Advertising, where her talents were recognized, and she rose to become Head of Casting and then Di-rector of Public Relations. In 1975, seeking an opportunity to have a bigger impact, Ms. Cohn left the advertising firm to become Director of Marketing (Non- Theatrical) at Paramount Pictures. She be-came a Consultant for Showtime from 1977 to 1982, and then joined MGM/UA as Director of Pay TV where she remained until her retire-ment in 1986. In addition to her professional experience, Ms. Cohn has given generously of her time and attention to some of New York’s greatest cultural and civic institutions. She has served on the advisory board of the Maxwell School of Citizenship at Syracuse and the New York State Tourism Advisory Organization. She is on the Central Park Conservancy Women’s Committee; on the Lincoln Center Theater’s Patron Committee; on the development com-mittee board of Jazz at Lincoln Center; on the board and executive committee of New Dram-atists; and a Co-Chair of the Chairman’s Council of New York Historical Society. Ms. Cohn’s deep knowledge and under-standing America’s cultural institutions were recognized when she was appointed by Presi-dent Bill Clinton to the President’s Committee on the Arts and the Humanities, a committee established to advise the President, the Na-tional Endowment for the Arts and the Na-tional Endowment for the Humanities on ways to promote private sector support for, espe-cially at the state and local level. A longtime political activist, Ms. Cohn has been deeply involved in Democratic politics, and especially interested in helping women win. She served as Executive Vice President of the Women’s Leadership Forum of the Democratic National Committee. When Hillary Clinton ran for Senate, Ms. Cohn was Vice Chair of Finance for her campaign. She was the co-creator of the Tri-State Maxed-Out Women’s Committee for Hillary Clinton (2006 to 2008), which held information sessions and brought well-known leaders to speak with women who had been major donors to Hillary Clinton’s Presidential campaign. Ms. Cohn then created the Tristate Women’s Maxed-Out Committee (2010 to present) whose political action committee supports Democratic women running for the U.S. House or Senate. Ms. Cohn also serves on the Board of Eleanor’s Legacy, which raises funds for Democratic women in New York State. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating the extraordinary contributions of Betsy Cohn, who has created opportunities for women to become leaders. COMMEMORATING THE LIFE OF ROBERT TERRY HON. PRAMILA JAYAPAL 
OF WASHINGTON  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 2, 2018 Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of longtime Seattle resi-dent, Mr. Robert Terry, who recently passed away at the age of 91. Mr. Terry became the first black man to teach in Seattle Public Schools in 1950, four years before the historic Brown v. Board of Education decision that banned states from segregating schools by race. Raised by his grandmother, Ella Trice, Mr. Terry began his long life in education at Greenwood Elementary School in La Grande, Oregon. After graduating from high school, he served in the Navy in World War II. He then returned to live with his grandmother while at-tending the University of Oregon, earning a degree in Education from Eastern Oregon Col-lege in 1950. He later earned a master’s de-gree in Student Personnel from Seattle Uni-versity. Mr. Terry built a long and distinguished ca-reer in the Seattle School District, as Presi-dent of Seattle Central Community College and then Chancellor of the Seattle Community College System. He also gained deep respect in his Mount Baker neighborhood community, where he resided since 1962. A football fan and athlete himself, he mentored young play-ers in his neighborhood as he drove them to practice—truly exemplifying what it means to be a dedicated educator in and outside the classroom. I would like to commemorate Mr. Terry’s lifetime of achievements, his decades of serv-ice to our community and his work to lift up young students long marginalized by inequities in education. My heart is with his loving family and friends. He will be long remembered and deeply missed.

CELEBRATING THE 107TH NATIONAL DAY OF TAIWAN 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 2, 2018 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to extend to the Government and the people of Taiwan con-gratulations on the 107th National Day of Tai-wan. As a vibrant democracy and strong contrib-utor to the global economy, Taiwan plays an important role in the peace and security of the Asia-Pacific region. Since its formation, Taiwan has rapidly in-dustrialized and now has become a model economy for many countries. Even more important than its economic achievements, Taiwan has developed into a strong and vibrant democracy. Taiwan is a valued member of the commu-nity of civilized nations, even though it is bur-dened with particular and unique diplomatic challenges—challenges which the Taiwanese people and government have met with cour-age and grace.

Taiwan remains important to the United States in its advocacy of true democratic val-ues across the world and its success in sus-taining a dynamic multi-party system revealing its commitment to protecting political rights and freedoms. In troubled times such as these, it is also gratifying to know that there are countries that continue to put forth efforts that provide con-structive solutions for highly divisive issues. The bond between the United States and Taiwan, cemented by the Taiwan Relations Act and the Six Assurances, remains strong. I reaffirm those bonds today, and again con-gratulate the people of Taiwan on this impor-tant occasion.

INTRODUCTION OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS HOME RULE ACT 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 2, 2018 Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today, I intro-duce the District of Columbia Public-Private Partnerships Home Rule Act. This bill would clarify the District of Columbia’s authority to enter into public-private partnerships (P3s), like other jurisdictions in the United States. This bill makes it clear that the federal Anti- Deficiency Act (ADA), which uniquely applies to the District, does not prohibit the District from entering into P3s. This bill provides legal certainty that the District may enter into multi- year contracts to design, construct, improve, maintain, operate, manage and/or finance projects procured pursuant to a local D.C. law, the Public-Private Partnership Act of 2014. The District recently began the procurement process for its first-ever P3s: rehabilitating the Metropolitan Police Department headquarters (Henry J. Daly Building) and modernizing streetlights. Federal law potentially limits the authority of only one jurisdiction, the District of Columbia, to enter into P3s. The federal government, many states and other countries have used P3 s. There is no reason that the District should not be able to take advantage of this option. Among other benefits, P3s will free up District funds for pressing needs, such as education and health care, that would otherwise be spent on infrastructure. The federal ADA prohibits the federal and D.C. governments from obligating or expend-ing funds in advance or in excess of an appro-priation. If the District could use P3s, it would not have to appropriate all the funds upfront, freeing up funds for the District to spend on other matters. An ADA violation may occur if the District terminates a P3 contract. Under P3 contracts, the District would make payments on an annual basis over the life of a contract, and the District would appropriate the funds for such payments annually. However, upon termination, the District would have to pay all the costs incurred up to that point, but would not yet have appropriated all the funds for such payments, potentially causing an ADA violation. Under D.C. law, 
a ‘public-private partnership’ means the method in the District for delivering a quali-fied project using a long-term, performance- based agreement between a public entity and a private entity or entities where appro-priate risks and benefits can be allocated in a cost-effective manner between the public and private entities in which: (A) A private entity performs functions normally undertaken by the government, but the public entity remains ultimately ac-countable for the qualified project and its public function; and (B) The District may retain ownership or control in the project asset and the private entity may be given additional decision- making rights in determining how the asset is financed, developed, constructed, oper-ated, and maintained over its life cycle. This bill is an important step to increase home rule for the District, and I urge my col-leagues to support this bill.

MARY ELLEN TRAIL ROSS EARNS GOLD MEDAL FROM GOOD SA-MARITAN FOUNDATION 
HON. PETE OLSON 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 2, 2018 Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Mary Ellen Trail Ross, Dr. P.H., M.S.N., R.N. of Fort Bend County, who was awarded a gold medal from the Good Samari-tan Foundation. Ross began her teaching career at the Uni-versity of Texas Health Science Center at Houston (UTHealth) Cizik School of Nursing 30 years ago. She has taught 17 different courses. Her work has helped students and faculty alike. Her dedication has resulted in a gold medal in the ‘‘Nursing Education: Fac-ulty’’ category at the Good Samaritan Founda-tion’s 2018 ‘‘Excellence in Nursing’’ Awards ceremony. Nurses are nominated by their peers for exemplifying excellence in teaching, mentoring and leadership. Ross credits the foundation in helping her achieve her own goals, as she received their scholarship funds during her time as a graduate student. She is passionate about educating future nurses. On behalf of the Twenty-Second Congres-sional District of Texas, congratulations again to Mary Ellen Trail Ross for earning a gold medal from the Good Samaritan Foundation. Her contributions to the field of medicine as well education make our community proud.

TRIBUTE TO BUDDY SCOTTO 
HON. NYDIA M. VELA´ZQUEZ 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 2, 2018 Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Buddy Scotto, a longtime friend, community member and local leader from Car-roll Gardens, Brooklyn. For decades, Buddy’s commitment to serving the community he loves has led many neighbors and friends to nickname him as the unofficial Mayor of Car-roll Gardens. Buddy’s family came to Carroll Gardens as Italian immigrants to Brooklyn. The family quickly became known in the community as they started a funeral-home business, a wine business, and later, four movie theaters. After graduating from the original St. Francis College, Buddy served in the Korean War. When his parents were nearing retirement, Buddy returned home to obtain his Funeral Di-rectors License. When many of his peers were leaving Brooklyn for suburbs in Long Island, Buddy’s deep sense of connection to Brooklyn and care for his community led him to become a champion for local causes. Among his many areas of advocacy, Buddy has fought for affordable housing for seniors and low-income families, while also advocating to clean up the Gowanus Canal. In 1971, he founded the Carroll Gardens Association which helps advocate for affordable housing and local business growth. In 1978, Buddy founded the Gowanus Canal Community De-velopment Corporation, a non-profit focused on revitalizing the canal, organizing public meetings and expanding affordable housing. He also helped found the Eileen Dugan Senior Center, an important anchor for the commu-nity. On the very special occasion of his 90th birthday this year, I would like to thank Buddy for everything he has done and continues to do for the Carroll Gardens community. The neighborhood would not be the same without him. f 
THE RETIREMENT OF VICE ADMIRAL DAVID JOHNSON, USN 
HON. JOE COURTNEY 
OF CONNECTICUT  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 2, 2018 Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize and congratulate an outstanding Naval Officer, Vice Admiral David C. Johnson, for the successful completion of 36 years of distinguished Naval service, culminating with his position as the Principal Military Deputy for the Assistant Secretary of the Navy Research, Development and Acquisition. I commend Vice Admiral Johnson on his achievements and recognize his devotion to our great nation. A 1982 graduate of the United States Naval Academy, Admiral Johnson earned his Engi-neering Duty Officer Dolphins in 1986 and graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1989 with a Naval Engineer de-gree and a Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering. He has devoted most of his ca-reer to the design, construction, repair, main-tenance, modernization and sustainment of the nation’s submarine force. During his ca-reer, he served as the Program Executive Offi-cer for Submarines, the Commander for the Naval Undersea Warfare Center, the Deputy Commander for Undersea Technology, the Major Program Manager for Virginia Class Submarines, an Assistant Program Manager for Seawolf Class Submarines, the Program Manager’s Representative at the new con-struction shipyard, a Project Officer, a Ship Superintendent and as Planning and Docking Officer. During Admiral Johnson’s tour as Program Executive Officer for Submarines, he managed over $50 billion in funding across the Future Years Defense Plan for the research, design, acquisition and in-service support of the Navy’s undersea force. In addition to accept-ing delivery of five Virginia Class submarines ahead of schedule and under cost, he led the Defense Department’s highest priority acquisi-tion program, the Columbia Class ballistic mis-sile submarine, through critical development

milestones. He grew the U.S. Navy’s stature and involvement in assisting key foreign part-ners in the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada and Spain. A significant highlight of this tour was the award of the largest shipbuilding con-tract in our nation’s history—the $17.6 billion Virginia Class Submarine Block Four contract. This multi-year contract reflected cost savings and risk reduction initiatives that set the basis for long-term industrial base stability while affordably providing the submarine force with critical assets around the world. In his final assignment, Admiral Johnson led an acquisition workforce of 60,000 military and civilian personnel in maintaining the Navy’s fu-ture technological edge through daily oversight of critical investments. He executed three pro-gressively intensive budget cycles ensuring the execution of 202 acquisition programs with applied resources in excess of $60 billion per year. His innovative approach led to an estab-lished framework for multiple accelerated ac-quisition programs ensuring that our sailors and marines were equipped with the most state-of-the-art technology. A tremendous steward of the taxpayers, he has put afford-ability into action—saving billions of dollars. He worked with the Secretary of the Navy, Chief of Naval Operations and Commandant of the Marine Corps to effectively and effi-ciently implement the Navy’s warfighting re-quirements and resourced programs. As ranking Member of the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Seapower and Projection Forces and as Representative for eastern Connecticut, the Submarine Capital of the World, I have witnessed firsthand over many years Admiral Johnson’s steady leader-ship and stewardship of our nation’s sub-marine construction programs. Since my first days as a new member of the committee in 2007, Admiral Johnson has been a tremen-dous resource to me personally, and to my staff—providing keen insight and a wealth of shipbuilding knowledge that has helped guide good policy making and smart budgetary deci-sions in Congress. Admiral Johnson’s 36 years of honorable service to this nation and professional success would not have been possible without the steadfast support of his wife, Carol and daughters, Ellen, Elizabeth, and Anne. I ask all my colleagues to join me in honoring Admi-ral Johnson and his family for their service to our nation and wish Admiral Johnson fair winds and following seas in the next exciting chapter of his life.

HONORING THE NATIONAL DAY OF THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA 
HON. CHRISTOPHER H. SMITH 
OF NEW JERSEY  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 2, 2018 Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, Oc-tober 10, 2018 marks the 107th National Day of the Republic of China, or ‘‘Double Ten Day,’’ as it is known in Chinese. On this auspi-cious day we not only have an opportunity to reflect on the bond between the American and Taiwanese people—our shared democratic values and historical partnership—but also look forward to strengthened ties of friendship and collaboration. Founded by Dr. Sun Yat-sen on October 10, 1911, the Republic of China stands as a bea-con of freedom and democracy on the island of Taiwan, and as a positive counterexample to mainland China which, under Xi Jinping, has turned to greater repression and contempt for human rights. Let us not forget that the Republic of China, which had to endure many challenges and so-cial upheavals during its tenure of rule in mainland China from 1911 to 1949, was the first allied country to be attacked in World War II. Our two countries locked arms and resisted the Imperial Japanese Army, with the first American aviators volunteering with Major General Claire Chennault and the fabled Fly-ing Tigers to resist the Japanese from the air in 1941. Eventually, Japan and the Axis pow-ers were defeated decisively, and the Republic of China became one of the founding mem-bers of the United Nations and attained a seat on the Security Council. Despite some hesitant steps on our part, we again stood together against the Communists led by Mao Zedong, both before and after the Republic established itself on Taiwan, from where it offered support to our forces resisting Communist tyranny on the Korean peninsula. In the ensuing decades, the Republic of China on Taiwan emerged from authoritarian rule to become the first authentically democratic na-tion in Chinese history. Taiwan has since become a beacon of hope and optimism in the Asia-Pacific region. Its people enjoy all basic freedoms, including freedom of the press, assembly, and religion. Through the Taiwan Relations Act and the Six Assurances, the American people have strengthened our bond with the people of Tai-wan. Recent Congressional endeavors, such as the Taiwan Travel Act—which I proudly co-sponsored—undoubtedly will lead to further cooperation and friendship. It is perhaps because of Taiwan’s demo-cratic culture that China feels so threatened by it. Mainland China has launched a multi-di-mensional campaign against Taiwan that in-cludes many aggressive and provocative ac-tions, such as the dispatching of warships, bombers, and fighter jets to encircle the is-land, as well as conducting live-fire military ex-ercises near Taiwan’s waters. Furthermore, in the diplomatic arena, China has worked as-siduously to cut off Taiwan’s diplomatic part-ners and block Taiwan from participating in international organizations. Taiwan has a com-parative advantage in areas such as global health, and it is a travesty that for no other reason than to assuage China, Taiwan is pro-hibited from participating in critical fora such as the World Health Assembly. Now more than ever, Taiwan needs our support. Mr. Speaker, the moral and geopolitical case for Taiwan is strong and consistent with the Administration’s commitment to build a free and open Indo-Pacific. Taiwan is a model of democracy, prosperity, rights protections, and the rule of law. Citizens of the Republic of China on Taiwan should know on its 107th an-niversary that that the American people, and the Congress, stand with them. HONOR FLIGHT NORTHERN COLORADO 2018 HON. KEN BUCK

RECOGNIZING THE RETIREMENT OF DIANE NARASAKI 
HON. PRAMILA JAYAPAL 
OF WASHINGTON  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 2, 2018 Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to extend my congratulations to Diane Narasaki on her retirement after 23 years of service at the Asian Counseling and Referral Service (ACRS). Throughout her career, Diane dem-onstrated her deep, personal commitment to civil rights and social justice by standing up for immigrants and refugees, defending diversity and encouraging civic engagement. Diane was born in Seattle not long after the end of World War II. She was driven to a ca-reer in social justice in part because of the in-humane treatment of Japanese and Japanese Americans incarcerated during the war. She ultimately built ACRS into the globally-recog-nized powerhouse it is today, growing it from 14,000 members to over 35,000 and from 76 staff members to 270. In one of her early acts at ACRS, Diane or-ganized the Asian Pacific Islander (API) com-munity to mount a response to 1996 federal welfare reform legislation, which barred legal immigrants from accessing certain federal safety net programs, including food stamps and medical assistance. Thanks to Diane’s leadership and the tireless advocacy of com-munities across Washington, the state passed legislation to replace many of the public as-sistance programs for immigrants that were lost at the federal level. Also, during her time at ACRS, Diane orga-nized the API community to increase funding for employment training and naturalization services targeted to help low-income immi-grants, refugees, and those with limited English proficiency to gain citizenship. With her leadership, ACRS obtained federal funding to develop integrated mental health services, which had an incredible impact on the lives and well-being of API people. Prior to joining ACRS, Diane also served as Executive Direc-tor of the Northwest Labor and Employment Law Office, co-founded the King County Asian Pacific Islander Coalition and was named by President Obama to the White House Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. Her contributions to the API community are innu-merable. Diane has received numerous awards to recognize these contributions. The Seattle City Council proclaimed a ‘‘Diane Narasaki Day’’ in 2006. In 2009, Seattle Magazine declared her one of one of their ‘‘most influential people of the year.’’ She received a Puget Sound Busi-ness Journal Women of Influence Award, a Ford Foundation Leadership for a Changing World Award, the ACLU of Washington’s Wil-liam O. Douglas Award and many, many more. Still, what makes Diane so special is not these awards but her dedication to lifting up marginalized people in our community and across the country. Though she is moving on from ACRS, I have no doubt that she will con-tinue to thread her passion and activism into everything she does. I commend Diane Narasaki and the incalculable impact of her life’s work. I wish her a healthy and joyous re-tirement.
