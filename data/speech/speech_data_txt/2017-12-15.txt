PRAYER Reverend Dr. Dan C. Cummins, Peo-ples Church, Jacksonville, Texas, of-fered the following prayer: Our Father in Heaven, during this Christmas season may we remember it is better to give than to receive. And the best gift is the one given to those who cannot repay. And let us remember the homeless this holiday season, for so was our Sav-ior’s family on the night of his birth. And while the world went to be taxed, God taught the world about giv-ing your best to perfect strangers, for in so doing we may be entertaining an-gels unaware. And like the wise men, let us never consider the distance or difficulty of our journey to offer our gifts to the King. And may we follow the example of this King, who being the very image of God, humbled himself to save others, laying down his life on the cross for their sin. That was the most perfect Christmas gift of all. In Jesus’ name I pray. Amen. f

N GENERAL .—A normalization method of accounting shall not be treated as being used with respect to any public utility property for purposes of section 167 or 168 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 if the taxpayer, in com-puting its cost of service for ratemaking pur-poses and reflecting operating results in its reg-ulated books of account, reduces the excess tax reserve more rapidly or to a greater extent than such reserve would be reduced under the aver-age rate assumption method. (2) A
LTERNATIVE METHOD FOR CERTAIN TAX -
PAYERS .—If, as of the first day of the taxable year that includes the date of enactment of this Act— (A) the taxpayer was required by a regulatory agency to compute depreciation for public util-ity property on the basis of an average life or composite rate method, and (B) the taxpayer’s books and underlying records did not contain the vintage account data necessary to apply the average rate as-sumption method, the taxpayer will be treated as using a normal-ization method of accounting if, with respect to such jurisdiction, the taxpayer uses the alter-native method for public utility property that is subject to the regulatory authority of that juris-diction.

XCESS TAX RESERVE .—The term ‘‘excess tax reserve’’ means the excess of— (i) the reserve for deferred taxes (as described in section 168(i)(9)(A)(ii) of the Internal Rev-enue Code of 1986) as of the day before the cor-porate rate reductions provided in the amend-ments made by this section take effect, over (ii) the amount which would be the balance in such reserve if the amount of such reserve were determined by assuming that the corporate rate reductions provided in this Act were in effect for all prior periods. (B) A
VERAGE RATE ASSUMPTION METHOD .—The average rate assumption method is the method under which the excess in the reserve for de-ferred taxes is reduced over the remaining lives of the property as used in its regulated books of account which gave rise to the reserve for de-ferred taxes. Under such method, during the time period in which the timing differences for the property reverse, the amount of the adjust-ment to the reserve for the deferred taxes is cal-culated by multiplying— (i) the ratio of the aggregate deferred taxes for the property to the aggregate timing differences for the property as of the beginning of the pe-riod in question, by (ii) the amount of the timing differences which reverse during such period. (C) A
LTERNATIVE METHOD .—The ‘‘alternative method’’ is the method in which the taxpayer— (i) computes the excess tax reserve on all pub-lic utility property included in the plant ac-count on the basis of the weighted average life or composite rate used to compute depreciation for regulatory purposes, and (ii) reduces the excess tax reserve ratably over the remaining regulatory life of the property.

TITLE I INDIVIDUAL TAX PROVISIONS A. Reduction and Simplification of Individual Income Tax Rates (sec. 1001 of the House bill, sec. 11001 of the Senate amendment, and sec. 1 of the Code) PRESENT LAW  In general To determine regular tax liability, an indi-vidual taxpayer generally must apply the tax rate schedules (or the tax tables) to his or her regular taxable income. The rate sched-ules are broken into several ranges of in-come, known as income brackets, and the marginal tax rate increases as a taxpayer’s income increases. Tax rate schedules Separate rate schedules apply based on an individual’s filing status. For 2017, the reg-ular individual income tax rate schedules are as follows:

6Sec. 3.02 of Rev. Proc. 2016–55, supra. 
7Sec. 1(g)(4).

9Sec. 1(g)(6). See Form 8615, Tax for Certain Chil-dren Who Have Unearned Income. 10Sec. 1(g)(1). 
11Sec. 1(g)(7). Unearned income of children Special rules (generally referred to as the ‘‘kiddie tax’’) apply to the net unearned in-come of certain children.
1Generally, the kiddie tax applies to a child if: (1) the child has not reached the age of 19 by the close of the taxable year, or the child is a full-time student under the age of 24, and either of the child’s parents is alive at such time; (2) the child’s unearned income exceeds $2,100 (for 2017); and (3) the child does not file a joint return.
2The kiddie tax applies regardless of whether the child may be claimed as a de-pendent by either or both parents. For chil-dren above age 17, the kiddie tax applies only to children whose earned income does not ex-ceed one-half of the amount of their support. Under these rules, the net unearned in-come of a child (for 2017, unearned income over $2,100) is taxed at the parents’ tax rates if the parents’ tax rates are higher than the tax rates of the child.
3The remainder of a child’s taxable income (i.e., earned income, plus unearned income up to $2,100 (for 2017), less the child’s standard deduction) is taxed at the child’s rates, regardless of whether the kiddie tax applies to the child. For these purposes, unearned income is income other than wages, salaries, professional fees, other amounts received as compensation for per-sonal services actually rendered, and dis-tributions from qualified disability trusts.
4 In general, a child is eligible to use the pref-erential tax rates for qualified dividends and capital gains.
5 The kiddie tax is calculated by computing the ‘‘allocable parental tax.’’ This involves adding the net unearned income of the child to the parent’s income and then applying the parent’s tax rate. A child’s ‘‘net unearned in-come’’ is the child’s unearned income less the sum of (1) the minimum standard deduc-tion allowed to dependents ($1,050 for 2017
6), and (2) the greater of (a) such minimum standard deduction amount or (b) the amount of allowable itemized deductions that are directly connected with the produc-tion of the unearned income.
7 The allocable parental tax equals the hypo-thetical increase in tax to the parent that results from adding the child’s net unearned income to the parent’s taxable income.
8If the child has net capital gains or qualified dividends, these items are allocated to the parent’s hypothetical taxable income accord-ing to the ratio of net unearned income to the child’s total unearned income. If a par-ent has more than one child subject to the kiddie tax, the net unearned income of all children is combined, and a single kiddie tax is calculated. Each child is then allocated a proportionate share of the hypothetical in-crease, based upon the child’s net unearned income relative to the aggregate net un-earned income of all of the parent’s children subject to the tax. Generally, a child must file a separate re-turn to report his or her income.
9In such case, items on the parents’ return are not af-fected by the child’s income, and the total tax due from the child is the greater of: 1. The sum of (a) the tax payable by the child on the child’s earned income and un-earned income up to $2,100 (for 2017), plus (b) the allocable parental tax on the child’s un-earned income, or 2. The tax on the child’s income without regard to the kiddie tax provisions.10 Under certain circumstances, a parent may elect to report a child’s unearned income on the parent’s return.
11 Capital gains rates In general In the case of an individual, estate, or trust, any adjusted net capital gain which otherwise would be taxed at the 10- or 15-per-cent rate is not taxed. Any adjusted net cap-ital gain which otherwise would be taxed at rates over 15-percent and below 39.6 percent is taxed at a 15-percent rate. Any adjusted net capital gain which otherwise would be taxed at a 39.6-percent rate is taxed at a 20- percent rate. The unrecaptured section 1250 gain is taxed at a maximum rate of 25 percent, and 28-per-cent rate gain is taxed at a maximum rate of 28 percent. Any amount of unrecaptured sec-tion 1250 gain or 28-percent rate gain other-wise taxed at a 10- or 15-percent rate is taxed at the otherwise applicable rate. In addition, a tax is imposed on net invest-ment income in the case of an individual, es-tate, or trust. In the case of an individual, the tax is 3.8 percent of the lesser of net in-vestment income, which includes gains and dividends, or the excess of modified adjusted gross income over the threshold amount. The threshold amount is $250,000 in the case of a joint return or surviving spouse, $125,000 in the case of a married individual filing a sepa-rate return, and $200,000 in the case of any other individual. Definitions Net capital gain In general, gain or loss reflected in the value of an asset is not recognized for in-come tax purposes until a taxpayer disposes of the asset. On the sale or exchange of a capital asset, any gain generally is included in income. Net capital gain is the excess of the net long-term capital gain for the tax-able year over the net short-term capital loss for the year. Gain or loss is treated as long-term if the asset is held for more than one year. A capital asset generally means any prop-erty except (1) inventory, stock in trade, or property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of the taxpayer’s trade or business, (2) depreciable or real property used in the taxpayer’s trade or business, (3) specified literary or artistic property, (4) business accounts or notes re-ceivable, (5) certain U.S. publications, (6) certain commodity derivative financial in-struments, (7) hedging transactions, and (8) business supplies. In addition, the net gain from the disposition of certain property used in the taxpayer’s trade or business is treated as long-term capital gain. Gain from the dis-position of depreciable personal property is not treated as capital gain to the extent of all previous depreciation allowances. Gain from the disposition of depreciable real prop-erty is generally not treated as capital gain to the extent of the depreciation allowances in excess of the allowances available under the straight-line method of depreciation. Adjusted net capital gain The ‘‘adjusted net capital gain’’ of an indi-vidual is the net capital gain reduced (but not below zero) by the sum of the 28-percent rate gain and the unrecaptured section 1250 gain. The net capital gain is reduced by the amount of gain that the individual treats as investment income for purposes of deter-mining the investment interest limitation under section 163(d). Qualified dividend income Adjusted net capital gain is increased by the amount of qualified dividend income. A dividend is the distribution of property made by a corporation to its shareholders out of its after-tax earnings and profits. Qualified dividends generally includes divi-dends received from domestic corporations and qualified foreign corporations. The term ‘‘qualified foreign corporation’’ includes a foreign corporation that is eligible for the benefits of a comprehensive income tax trea-ty with the United States which the Treas-ury Department determines to be satisfac-tory and which includes an exchange of in-formation program. In addition, a foreign corporation is treated as a qualified foreign corporation for any dividend paid by the cor-poration with respect to stock that is readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States. If a shareholder does not hold a share of stock for more than 60 days during the 121- day period beginning 60 days before the ex- dividend date (as measured under section 246(c)), dividends received on the stock are not eligible for the reduced rates. Also, the reduced rates are not available for dividends to the extent that the taxpayer is obligated to make related payments with respect to positions in substantially similar or related property. Dividends received from a corporation that is a passive foreign investment company (as defined in section 1297) in either the taxable year of the distribution, or the preceding taxable year, are not qualified dividends. A dividend is treated as investment income for purposes of determining the amount of deductible investment interest only if the taxpayer elects to treat the dividend as not eligible for the reduced rates. The amount of dividends qualifying for re-duced rates that may be paid by a regulated investment company (‘‘RIC’’) for any taxable year in which the qualified dividend income received by the RIC is less than 95 percent of its gross income (as specially computed) may not exceed the sum of (1) the qualified divi-dend income of the RIC for the taxable year and (2) the amount of earnings and profits accumulated in a non-RIC taxable year that were distributed by the RIC during the tax-able year. The amount of qualified dividend income that may be paid by a real estate investment trust (‘‘REIT’’) for any taxable year may not exceed the sum of (1) the qualified dividend income of the REIT for the taxable year, (2) an amount equal to the excess of the income subject to the taxes imposed by section 857(b)(1) and the regulations prescribed under section 337(d) for the preceding taxable year over the amount of these taxes for the pre-ceding taxable year, and (3) the amount of earnings and profits accumulated in a non- REIT taxable year that were distributed by the REIT during the taxable year. Dividends received from an organization that was exempt from tax under section 501 or was a tax-exempt farmers’ cooperative in either the taxable year of the distribution or the preceding taxable year; dividends re-ceived from a mutual savings bank that re-ceived a deduction under section 591; or de-ductible dividends paid on employer securi-ties are not qualified dividend income. 28-percent rate gain The term ‘‘28-percent rate gain’’ means the excess of the sum of the amount of net gain attributable to long-term capital gains and losses from the sale or exchange of collect-ibles (as defined in section 408(m) without re-gard to paragraph (3) thereof) and the amount of gain equal to the additional amount of gain that would be excluded from gross income under section 1202 (relating to

Unrecaptured section 1250 gain ‘‘Unrecaptured section 1250 gain’’ means any long-term capital gain from the sale or exchange of section 1250 property (i.e., depre-ciable real estate) held more than one year to the extent of the gain that would have been treated as ordinary income if section 1250 applied to all depreciation, reduced by the net loss (if any) attributable to the items taken into account in computing 28-percent rate gain. The amount of unrecaptured sec-tion 1250 gain (before the reduction for the net loss) attributable to the disposition of property to which section 1231 (relating to certain property used in a trade or business) applies may not exceed the net section 1231 gain for the year. 
HOUSE BILL  Modification of rates The House bill replaces the individual in-come tax rate structure with a new rate structure. 
TABLE 2.—FEDERAL INDIVIDUAL INCOME TAX RATES FOR 2018 UNDER THE HOUSE BILL 
If taxable income is: Then income tax equals: 
Single Individuals Not over $45,000 ................... 12% of the taxable income Over $45,000 but not over $200,000. $5,400 plus 25% of the excess over $45,000 Over $200,000 but not over $500,000. $44,150 plus 35% of the excess over $200,000 Over $500,000 ....................... $149,150 plus 39.6% of the excess over $500,000 
Heads of Households Not over $67,500 ................... 12% of the taxable income Over $67,500 but not over $200,000. $8,100 plus 25% of the excess over $67,500 Over $200,000 but not over $500,000. $41,225 plus 35% of the excess over $200,000 Over $500,000 ....................... $146,225 plus 39.6% of the excess over $500,000 
Married Individuals Filing Joint Returns and Surviving Spouses Not over $90,000 ................... 12% of the taxable income Over $90,000 but not over $260,000. $10,800 plus 25% of the excess over $90,000 Over $260,000 but not over $1,000,000. $53,300 plus 35% of the excess over $260,000 Over $1,000,000 .................... $312,300 plus 39.6% of the excess over $1,000,000 
Married Individuals Filing Separate Returns Not over $45,000 ................... 12% of the taxable income Over $45,000 but not over $130,000. $5,400 plus 25% of the excess over $45,000 Over $130,000 but not over $500,000. $26,650 plus 35% of the excess over $130,000 Over $500,000 ....................... $156,150 plus 39.6% of the excess over $500,000 
Estates and Trusts Not over $2,550 ..................... 12% of the taxable income Over $2,550 but not over $9,150. $306 plus 25% of the excess over $2,550 Over $9,150 but not over $12,500. $1,956 plus 35% of the excess over $9,150 Over $12,500 ......................... $3,128.50 plus 39.6% of the excess over $12,500 
The dollar amounts for bracket thresholds are all adjusted for inflation and then round-ed to the next lowest multiple of $100 in fu-ture years.
12Unlike present law, which uses a measure of the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (‘‘CPI–U’’), the new in-flation adjustment uses the Chained Con-sumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (‘‘C–CPI–U’’). Phaseout of benefit of the 12-percent bracket For taxpayers with adjusted gross income in excess of $1,000,000 ($1,200,000 in the case of married taxpayers filing jointly), the benefit of the 12-percent bracket, as measured against the 39.6-percent bracket, is phased out at a rate of 6-percent for taxpayers whose AGI is in excess of these amounts. Thus, in the case of a married taxpayer filing a joint return, if AGI is in excess of $1,200,000, the benefit of $24,840 (27.6-percent of $90,000) phases out over an income range of $414,000. The phaseout thresholds are indexed for inflation. Simplification of tax on unearned income of children The provision simplifies the ‘‘kiddie tax’’ by effectively applying ordinary and capital gains rates applicable to trusts and estates to the net unearned income of a child. Thus, as under present law, taxable income attrib-utable to earned income is taxed according to an unmarried taxpayers’ brackets and rates. Taxable income attributable to net unearned income is taxed according to the brackets applicable to trusts and estates, with respect to both ordinary income and in-come taxed at preferential rates. Thus, under the provision, the child’s tax is unaffected by the tax situation of the child’s parent or the unearned income of any siblings. Maximum rates on capital gains and quali-fied dividends The provision generally retains the present-law maximum rates on net capital gain and qualified dividends. The breakpoints between the zero- and 15-percent rates (‘‘15-percent breakpoint’’) and the 15- and 20-percent rates (‘‘20-percent break-point’’) are based on the same amounts as the breakpoints under present law, except the breakpoints are indexed using the C–CPI– U in taxable years beginning after 2017. Thus, for 2018, the 15-percent breakpoint is $77,200 for joint returns and surviving spouses (one-half of this amount for married taxpayers filing separately), $51,700 for heads of household, $2,600 for estates and trusts, and $38,600 for other unmarried individuals. The 20-percent breakpoint is $479,000 for joint returns and surviving spouses (one-half of this amount for married taxpayers filing sep-arately), $452,400 for heads of household, $12,700 for estates and trusts, and $425,800 for other unmarried individuals. Therefore, in the case of an individual (in-cluding an estate or trust) with adjusted net capital gain, to the extent the gain would not result in taxable income exceeding the 15-percent breakpoint, such gain is not taxed. Any adjusted net capital gain which would result in taxable income exceeding the 15-percent breakpoint but not exceeding the 20-percent breakpoint is taxed at 15 percent. The remaining adjusted net capital gain is taxed at 20 percent. As under present law, unrecaptured section 1250 gain generally is taxed at a maximum rate of 25 percent, and 28-percent rate gain is taxed at a maximum rate of 28 percent. Effective date.—The provision applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. SENATE AMENDMENT  Temporary modification of rates The Senate amendment temporarily re-places the individual income tax rate struc-ture with a new rate structure.

Unlike present law, which uses a measure of the CPI–U, the new inflation adjustment uses the C–CPI–U. The provision’s rate structure does not apply to taxable years beginning after De-cember 31, 2025. Temporary simplification of tax on unearned income of children The Senate amendment follows the House bill in applying ordinary and capital gains rates applicable to trusts and estates to the net unearned income of a child, but does not apply these changes to taxable years begin-ning after December 31, 2025. Maximum rates on capital gains and quali-fied dividends The Senate amendment follows the House bill and generally retains the present-law maximum rates on net capital gain and qualified dividends. Paid preparer due diligence requirement for head of household status The Senate amendment directs the Sec-retary of the Treasury to promulgate due diligence requirements for paid preparers in determining eligibility for a taxpayer to file as head of household. A penalty of $500 is im-posed for each failure to meet these require-ments. Effective date.—The provision applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H9993 December 15, 2017 
13For 2017, the additional amount is $1,250 for mar-ried taxpayers (for each spouse meeting the applica-ble criterion) and surviving spouses. The additional amount for single individuals and heads of house-holds is $1,550. An individual who qualifies as both blind and elderly is entitled to two additional stand-ard deductions, for a total additional amount (for 2017) of $2,500 or $3,100, as applicable. 
14Thus, the standard deduction is the same for 2018 and 2019. 
15The standard deduction continues to be indexed with the C–CPI–U after this sunset. TABLE 4.—FEDERAL INDIVIDUAL INCOME TAX RATES FOR 2018 UNDER THE CONFERENCE AGREEMENT

The provision’s rate structure does not apply to taxable years beginning after De-cember 31, 2025. The conference agreement does not follow the House bill in phasing out the benefit of the 12-percent bracket for taxpayers with ad-justed gross income in excess of $1,000,000 ($1,200,000 in the case of married taxpayers filing jointly). The conference agreement follows the House bill and generally retains present-law maximum rates on net capital gains and qualified dividends. The conference agreement follows the House bill in simplifying the tax on the un-earned income of children. This provision does not apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025. The conference agreement follows the Sen-ate amendment and directs the Secretary of the Treasury to promulgate due diligence re-quirements for paid preparers in determining eligibility for a taxpayer to file as head of household. Effective date.—The provision applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 1. Increase in standard deduction (sec. 1002 of the House bill, sec. 11021 of the Senate amendment, and sec. 63 of the Code) PRESENT LAW  Under present law, an individual who does not elect to itemize deductions may reduce his or her adjusted gross income (‘‘AGI’’) by the amount of the applicable standard deduc-tion in arriving at his or her taxable income. The standard deduction is the sum of the basic standard deduction and, if applicable, the additional standard deduction. The basic standard deduction varies depending upon a taxpayer’s filing status. For 2017, the amount of the basic standard deduction is $6,350 for single individuals and married individuals filing separate returns, $9,350 for heads of households, and $12,700 for married individ-uals filing a joint return and surviving spouses. An additional standard deduction is allowed with respect to any individual who is elderly or blind.
13The amount of the stand-ard deduction is indexed annually for infla-tion. In the case of a dependent for whom a de-duction for a personal exemption is allowed to another taxpayer, the standard deduction may not exceed the greater of (i) $1,050 (in 2017) or (ii) the sum of $350 (in 2017) plus the individual’s earned income. 
HOUSE BILL  The House bill increases the standard de-duction for individuals across all filing statuses. Under the provision, the amount of the standard deduction is $24,400 for married individuals filing a joint return, $18,300 for head-of-household filers, and $12,200 for all other taxpayers. The amount of the standard deduction is indexed for inflation using the C–CPI–U for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2019.
14 The provision eliminates the additional standard deduction for the aged and the blind. Effective date.—The provision is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The Senate amendment temporarily in-creases the basic standard deduction for indi-viduals across all filing statuses. Under the provision, the amount of the standard deduc-tion is temporarily increased to $24,000 for married individuals filing a joint return, $18,000 for head-of-household filers, and $12,000 for all other individuals. The amount of the standard deduction is indexed for in-flation using the C–CPI–U for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2018. The additional standard deduction for the elderly and the blind is not changed by the provision. The increase of the basic standard deduc-tion does not apply to taxable years begin-ning after December 31, 2025.
15 Effective date.—The provision is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the Sen-ate amendment. 2. Repeal of the deduction for personal ex-emptions (sec. 1003 of the House bill, sec. 11041 of the Senate amendment, and sec. 151 of the Code) PRESENT LAW  Under present law, in determining taxable income, an individual reduces AGI by any personal exemption deductions and either the applicable standard deduction or his or her itemized deductions. Personal exemp-tions generally are allowed for the taxpayer, his or her spouse, and any dependents. For 2017, the amount deductible for each personal exemption is $4,050. This amount is indexed annually for inflation. The personal exemp-tion amount is phased out in the case of an individual with AGI in excess of $313,800 for married taxpayers filing jointly, $287,650 for heads of household, $156,900 for married tax-payers filing separately, and $261,500 for all other filers. In addition, no personal exemp-tion is allowed in the case of a dependent if a deduction is allowed to another taxpayer. Withholding rules Under present law, the amount of tax re-quired to be withheld by employers from a taxpayer’s wages is based in part on the number of withholding exemptions a tax-payer claims on his Form W–4. An employee is entitled to the following exemptions: (1) an exemption for himself, unless he allowed to be claimed as a dependent of another per-son; (2) an exemption to which the employ-ee’s spouse would be entitled, if that spouse does not file a Form W–4 for that taxable year claiming an exemption described in (1); (3) an exemption for each individual who is a dependent (but only if the employee’s spouse has not also claimed such a withholding ex-emption on a Form W–4); (4) additional with-holding allowances (taking into account es-timated itemized deductions, estimated tax credits, and additional deductions as pro-vided by the Secretary of the Treasury); and (5) a standard deduction allowance. Filing requirements Under present law, an unmarried indi-vidual is required to file a tax return for the taxable year if in that year the individual had income which equals or exceeds the ex-emption amount plus the standard deduction applicable to such individual (i.e., single, head of household, or surviving spouse). An individual entitled to file a joint return is re-quired to do so unless that individual’s gross income, when combined with the individual’s spouse’s gross income for the taxable year, is less than the sum of twice the exemption amount plus the basic standard deduction applicable to a joint return, provided that such individual and his spouse, at the close of the taxable year, had the same household as their home. Trusts and estates In lieu of the deduction for personal ex-emptions, an estate is allowed a deduction of $600. A trust is allowed a deduction of $100; $300 if required to distribute all its income currently; and an amount equal to the per-sonal exemption of an individual in the case of a qualified disability trust. 
HOUSE BILL  The House bill repeals the deduction for personal exemptions. The provision modifies the requirements for those who are required to file a tax re-turn. In the case of an individual who is not married, such individual is required to file a tax return if the taxpayer’s gross income for the taxable year exceeds the applicable standard deduction. Married individuals are required to file a return if that individual’s gross income, when combined with the indi-vidual’s spouse’s gross income, for the tax-able year is more than the standard deduc-tion applicable to a joint return, provided

16The provision also clarifies that, for purposes of taxable years in which the personal exemption is re-duced to zero, this should not alter the operation of those provisions of the Code which refer to a tax-payer allowed a deduction (or an individual with re-spect to whom a taxpayer is allowed a deduction) under section 151. Thus, for instance, sec. 24(a) al-lows a credit against tax with respect to each quali-fying child of the taxpayer for which the taxpayer is allowed a deduction under section 151. A qualifying child, as defined under section 152(c), remains eligi-ble for the credit, notwithstanding that the deduc-tion under section 151 has been reduced to zero. 
17Generally, the Code adjusts calendar year values for cost of living by using the percentage by which the price index for the preceding calendar year ex-ceeds the price index for a base calendar year. Sec. 1(f). 18One exception is the increased standard deduc-tion which is indexed by C–CPI–U in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2019 and therefore is the same in 2018 and 2019. 
19The Senate Amendment indexes all tax values that are temporarily reset for 2018, including the basic standard deduction, with the C–CPI–U in tax-able years beginning after December 31, 2018. 20Sec. 701. 
21Sec. 702(a). 
22Sec. 704(d). In addition, passive loss and at-risk limitations limit the extent to which certain types of income can be offset by partnership deductions (sections 469 and 465). These limitations do not apply to corporate partners (except certain closely-held corporations) and may not be important to indi-vidual partners who have partner-level passive in-come from other investments. 
23Sec. 705. 
24Sec. 731. Gain or loss may nevertheless be recog-nized, for example, on the distribution of money or marketable securities, distributions with respect to contributed property, or in the case of dispropor-tionate distributions (which can result in ordinary income). 
25Sec. 704(b)(2). 
26Treas. Reg. sec. 1.704–1(b)(2). 
27The first LLC statute was enacted in Wyoming in 1977. All States (and the District of Columbia) now have an LLC statute, though the tax treatment of LLCs for State tax purposes may differ. 
28Under Treasury regulations promulgated in 1996, any domestic nonpublicly traded unincorporated en-tity with two or more members generally is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, while any single-member domestic unincorporated entity generally is treated as disregarded for Fed-eral income tax purposes (i.e., treated as not sepa- rate from its owner). Instead of the applicable de-fault treatment, however, an LLC may elect to be treated as a corporation for Federal income tax pur-poses. Treas. Reg. sec. 301.7701–3. These are known as the ‘‘check-the-box’’ regulations. 
29Sec. 7704(a). that: (i) such individual and his spouse, at the close of the taxable year, had the same household as their home; (ii) the individual’s spouse does not make a separate return; and (iii) neither the individual nor his spouse is a dependent of another taxpayer who has in-come (other than earned income) in excess of $500 (indexed for inflation). The provision repeals the enhanced deduc-tion for qualified disability trusts. Under the provision, the Secretary of the Treasury is to develop rules to determine the amount of tax required to be withheld by employers from a taxpayer’s wages. Effective date.—The provision is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The Senate amendment suspends the de-duction for personal exemptions.
16 The Senate amendment follows the House bill in modifying the requirements for those who are required to file a tax return. The provision does not apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025. Effective date.—The provision is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the Sen-ate amendment and suspends the deduction for personal exemptions. The suspension does not apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025. The conference agreement generally fol-lows the House bill in modifying the with-holding rules to reflect that taxpayers no longer claim personal exemptions under the conference agreement. Effective date.—The provision is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. The conference agreement provides that the Secretary may administer the with-holding rules under section 3402 for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2019, with-out regard to the amendments made under this provision. Thus, at the Secretary’s dis-cretion, wage withholding rules may remain the same as under present law for 2018. 3. Alternative inflation adjustment (secs. 1001 and 1005 of the House bill, sec. 11002 of the Senate amendment, and sec. 1 of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  Under present law, many parameters of the tax system are adjusted for inflation to pro-tect taxpayers from the effects of rising prices. Most of the adjustments are based on annual changes in the level of the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (‘‘CPI– U’’).
17The CPI–U is an index that measures prices paid by typical urban consumers on a broad range of products, and is developed and published by the Department of Labor. Among the inflation-indexed tax param-eters are the following individual income tax amounts: (1) the regular income tax brack-ets; (2) the basic standard deduction; (3) the additional standard deduction for aged and blind; (4) the personal exemption amount; (5) the thresholds for the overall limitation on itemized deductions and the personal exemp-tion phase-out; (6) the phase-in and phase- out thresholds of the earned income credit; (7) IRA contribution limits and deductible amounts; and (8) the saver’s credit. HOUSE BILL  The House bill requires the use of the Chained Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (‘‘C–CPI–U’’) to adjust tax param-eters currently indexed by the CPI–U. The C– CPI–U, like the CPI–U, is a measure of the average change over time in prices paid by urban consumers. It is developed and pub-lished by the Department of Labor, but dif-fers from the CPI–U in accounting for the ability of individuals to alter their consump-tion patterns in response to relative price changes. The C–CPI–U accomplishes this by allowing for consumer substitution between item categories in the market basket of con-sumer goods and services that make up the index, while the CPI–U only allows for mod-est substitution within item categories. Under the provision, indexed parameters in the Code switch from CPI–U indexing to C– CPI–U indexing going forward in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. Therefore, in the case of any existing tax pa-rameters that are not reset for 2018, the pro-vision indexes parameters as if CPI–U applies through 2017 and C–CPI–U applies for years thereafter; the provision does not index all existing tax parameters from their base years using the C–CPI–U. Tax parameters with cost-of-living adjustment base years of 2016 and later are indexed solely with C–CPI– U. Therefore, tax values that are reset for 2018 are indexed by the C–CPI–U in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2018.
18 Effective date.—The provision applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The Senate amendment generally follows the House bill.
19 The provision requiring C–CPI–U indexing after 2017 is permanent. Thus, after certain temporary tax parameters sunset, such as bracket thresholds and the increased basic standard deduction, corresponding present law values in the Code are indexed appro-priately with the C–CPI–U. Effective date.—The provision applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the Sen-ate amendment. B. Treatment of Business Income of Individuals, Trusts, and Estates 1. Deduction for qualified business income (sec. 1004 of the House bill, sec. 11011 of the Senate amendment, and sec. 199A of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  Individual income tax rates To determine regular tax liability, an indi-vidual taxpayer generally must apply the tax rate schedules (or the tax tables) to his or her regular taxable income. The rate sched-ules are broken into several ranges of in-come, known as income brackets, and the marginal tax rate increases as a taxpayer’s income increases. Separate rate schedules apply based on an individual’s filing status (i.e., single, head of household, married filing jointly, or married filing separately). For 2017, the regular individual income tax rate schedule provides rates of 10, 15, 25, 28, 33, 35, and 39.6 percent. Partnerships Partnerships generally are treated for Fed-eral income tax purposes as pass-through en-tities not subject to tax at the entity level.20 Items of income (including tax-exempt in-come), gain, loss, deduction, and credit of the partnership are taken into account by the partners in computing their income tax liability (based on the partnership’s method of accounting and regardless of whether the income is distributed to the partners).
21A partner’s deduction for partnership losses is limited to the partner’s adjusted basis in its partnership interest.
22Losses not allowed as a result of that limitation generally are car-ried forward to the next year. A partner’s ad-justed basis in the partnership interest gen-erally equals the sum of (1) the partner’s capital contributions to the partnership, (2) the partner’s distributive share of partner-ship income, and (3) the partner’s share of partnership liabilities, less (1) the partner’s distributive share of losses allowed as a de-duction and certain nondeductible expendi-tures, and (2) any partnership distributions to the partner.
23Partners generally may re-ceive distributions of partnership property without recognition of gain or loss, subject to some exceptions.
24 Partnerships may allocate items of in-come, gain, loss, deduction, and credit among the partners, provided the allocations have substantial economic effect.
25In gen- eral, an allocation has substantial economic effect to the extent the partner to which the allocation is made receives the economic benefit or bears the economic burden of such allocation and the allocation substantially affects the dollar amounts to be received by the partners from the partnership inde-pendent of tax consequences.
26 State laws of every State provide for lim-ited liability companies
27(‘‘LLCs’’), which are neither partnerships nor corporations under applicable State law, but which are generally treated as partnerships for Federal tax purposes.
28 Under present law, a publicly traded part-nership generally is treated as a corporation for Federal tax purposes.

30Sec. 7704(b). 
31Sec. 7704(c)(2). Qualifying income is defined to include interest, dividends, and gains from the dis-position of a capital asset (or of property described in section 1231(b)) that is held for the production of income that is qualifying income. Sec. 7704(d). Qualifying income also includes rents from real property, gains from the sale or other disposition of real property, and income and gains from the explo-ration, development, mining or production, proc-essing, refining, transportation (including pipelines transporting gas, oil, or products thereof), or the marketing of any mineral or natural resource (in-cluding fertilizer, geothermal energy, and timber), industrial source carbon dioxide, or the transpor-tation or storage of certain fuel mixtures, alter-native fuel, alcohol fuel, or biodiesel fuel. It also in-cludes income and gains from commodities (not de-scribed in section 1221(a)(1)) or futures, options, or forward contracts with respect to such commodities (including foreign currency transactions of a com-modity pool) where a principal activity of the part-nership is the buying and selling of such commod-ities, futures, options, or forward contracts. How-ever, the exception for partnerships with qualifying income does not apply to any partnership resem-bling a mutual fund (i.e., that would be described in section 851(a) if it were a domestic corporation), which includes a corporation registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (Pub. L. No. 76–768 (1940)) as a management company or unit invest-ment trust (sec. 7704(c)(3)). 
32An S corporation is so named because its Federal tax treatment is governed by subchapter S of the Code. 
33Secs. 1363 and 1366. 
34Sec. 1367. If any amount that would reduce the adjusted basis of a shareholder’s S corporation stock exceeds the amount that would reduce that basis to zero, the excess is applied to reduce (but not below zero) the shareholder’s basis in any indebtedness of the S corporation to the shareholder. If, after a re-duction in the basis of such indebtedness, there is an event that would increase the adjusted basis of the shareholder’s S corporation stock, such increase is instead first applied to restore the reduction in the basis of the shareholder’s indebtedness. Sec. 1367(b)(2). 35Sec. 1361. For this purpose, a husband and wife and all members of a family are treated as one shareholder. Sec. 1361(c)(1). 
36A single-member unincorporated entity is dis-regarded for Federal income tax purposes, unless its owner elects to be treated as a C corporation. Treas. Reg. sec. 301.7701–3(b)(1)(ii). Sole proprietorships often are conducted through legal entities for nontax reasons. While sole proprietorships generally may have no more than one owner, a married couple that files a joint return and jointly owns and oper-ates a business may elect to have that business treated as a sole proprietorship under section 761(f).

30 An exception from corporate treatment is provided for certain publicly traded partner-ships, 90 percent or more of whose gross in-come is qualifying income.
31 S corporations For Federal income tax purposes, an S cor-poration
32generally is not subject to tax at the corporate level.
33Items of income (in-cluding tax-exempt income), gain, loss, de-duction, and credit of the S corporation are taken into account by the S corporation shareholders in computing their income tax liabilities (based on the S corporation’s method of accounting and regardless of whether the income is distributed to the shareholders). A shareholder’s deduction for corporate losses is limited to the sum of the shareholder’s adjusted basis in its S corpora-tion stock and the indebtedness of the S cor-poration to such shareholder. Losses not al-lowed as a result of that limitation generally are carried forward to the next year. A shareholder’s adjusted basis in the S cor-poration stock generally equals the sum of (1) the shareholder’s capital contributions to the S corporation and (2) the shareholder’s pro rata share of S corporation income, less (1) the shareholder’s pro rata share of losses allowed as a deduction and certain non-deductible expenditures, and (2) any S cor-poration distributions to the shareholder.
34 In general, an S corporation shareholder is not subject to tax on corporate distributions unless the distributions exceed the share-holder’s basis in the stock of the corpora-tion. Electing S corporation status To be eligible to elect S corporation sta-tus, a corporation may not have more than 100 shareholders and may not have more than one class of stock.35Only individuals (other than nonresident aliens), certain tax- exempt organizations, and certain trusts and estates are permitted shareholders of an S corporation. Sole proprietorships Unlike a C corporation, partnership, or S corporation, a business conducted as a sole proprietorship is not treated as an entity distinct from its owner for Federal income tax purposes.
36Rather, the business owner is taxed directly on business income, and files Schedule C (sole proprietorships generally), Schedule E (rental real estate and royalties), or Schedule F (farms) with his or her indi-vidual tax return. Furthermore, transfer of a sole proprietorship is treated as a transfer of each individual asset of the business. None-theless, a sole proprietorship is treated as an entity separate from its owner for employ-ment tax purposes,
37for certain excise taxes,
38and certain information reporting requirements.

HOUSE BILL  Qualified business income of an individual from a partnership, S corporation, or sole proprietorship is subject to Federal income tax at a rate no higher than 25 percent. Qualified business income means, generally, all net business income from a passive busi-ness activity plus the capital percentage of net business income from an active business activity, reduced by carryover business losses and by certain net business losses from the current year, as determined under the provision. Determination of rate 25-percent rate The provision provides that an individual’s tax is reduced to reflect a maximum rate of 25 percent on qualified business income. Qualified business income includes the cap-ital percentage, generally 30 percent, of net business income. The percentage differs in the case of specified service activities or in the case of a taxpayer election to prove out a different percentage. Taxable income (reduced by net capital gain) that exceeds the maximum dollar amount for the 25-percent rate bracket appli-cable to the taxpayer, and that exceeds qualified business income, is subject to tax in the next higher brackets. The provision provides that a 25-percent tax rate applies generally to dividends re-ceived from a real estate investment trust (other than any portion that is a capital gain dividend or a qualified dividend), and applies generally to dividends that are includable in gross income from certain cooperatives. Nine-percent rate A special rule provides a reduced tax rate of 11, 10, or nine percent in the case of an in-dividual’s qualified active business income below an indexed threshold of $75,000 (in the case of a joint return or a surviving spouse) (the ‘‘nine-percent bracket threshold amount’’). The indexed $75,000 threshold is three quarters of that amount for individuals filing as head of household and half that amount for other individuals. The reduced rate is not available to estates and trusts. The reduced rate is phased in. The reduced rate is 11 percent (that is, one percentage point below the 12 percent rate) for taxable years beginning in 2018 and 2019, and is 10 percent (that is, two percentage points below the 12 percent rate) for taxable years begin-ning in 2020 and 2021. For taxable years be-ginning in 2022 and thereafter the reduced rate is nine percent (that is, three percent-age points below the 12 percent rate). The reduced tax rate applies to the least of three amounts, the taxpayer’s: (1) qualified active business income, (2) taxable income reduced by net capital gain, or (3) nine-per-cent bracket threshold amount (described above). Qualified active business income for a taxable year means the excess of the tax-payer’s net business income from any active business activity over his or her net business loss from any active business activity. An active business activity is an activity that involves the conduct of any trade or business and that is not a passive activity for pur-poses of the passive loss rules of section 469 determined without regard to paragraphs (2) and (6)(B) of section 469(c) (that is, generally, the taxpayer materially participates in the trade or business activity). Qualified active business income includes income from any trade or business activity, including service businesses. No capital percentage limitation applies in determining qualified active busi-ness income. A phaseout applies to the amount subject to the 11-, 10-, or nine-percent rate. The amount taxed at one of these rates is re-duced by the excess of taxable income over an indexed applicable threshold amount, $150,000 in the case of married individuals fil-ing jointly. The applicable threshold amount is three quarters of that amount for individ-uals filing as head of household and half that amount for other individuals. For example, assume that in 2022, an indi-vidual (married filing jointly) has $70,000 of qualified active business income and $40,000 of other income, resulting in taxable income of $110,000. The $70,000 of qualified active business income is subject to tax at nine per-cent. Alternatively, assume that in 2022, an-other individual has $160,000 of qualified ac-tive business income and $10,000 of other in-come resulting in taxable income of $170,000. The excess of the taxpayer’s $170,000 taxable income over the $150,000 applicable threshold amount is $20,000. Taking into account the phaseout, this $20,000 amount reduces the $75,000 amount that, absent the phaseout, would be subject to the nine-percent rate, re-versing the benefit of the nine-percent rate for $20,000 of the taxpayer’s qualified active business income. The effect is that $55,000 is subject to the nine percent rate. Qualified business income Qualified business income is defined as the sum of 100 percent of any net business in-come derived from any passive business ac-tivity plus the capital percentage of net business income derived from any active business activity, reduced by the sum of 100 percent of any net business loss derived from any passive business activity, 30 percent (ex-cept as otherwise provided under rules for determining the capital percentage, below) of any net business loss derived from any ac-tive business activity, and any carryover business loss determined for the preceding taxable year. Qualified business income does not include income from a business activity that exceeds these percentages.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH9996 December 15, 2017 
Net business income or loss To determine qualified business income re-quires a calculation of net business income or loss from each of an individual’s passive business activities and active business ac-tivities. Net business income or loss is deter-mined at the activity level, that is, sepa-rately for each business activity. Net business income is determined by ap-propriately netting items of income, gain, deduction and loss with respect to the busi-ness activity. The determination takes into account these amounts only to the extent the amount affects the determination of tax-able income for the year. For example, if in a taxable year, a business activity has 100 of ordinary income from inventory sales, and makes an expenditure of 25 that is required to be capitalized and amortized over 5 years under applicable tax rules, the net business income is 100 minus 5 (current-year ordinary amortization deduction), or 95. The net busi-ness income is not reduced by the entire amount of the capital expenditure, only by the amount deductible in determining tax-able income for the year. Net business income or loss includes the amounts received by the individual taxpayer as wages, director’s fees, guaranteed pay-ments and amounts received from a partner-ship other than in the individual’s capacity as a partner, that are properly attributable to a business activity. These amounts are taken into account as an item of income with respect to the business activity. For ex-ample, if an individual shareholder of an S corporation engaged in a business activity is paid wages or director’s fees by the S cor-poration, the amount of wages or director’s fees is added in determining net business or loss with respect to the business activity. This rule is intended to ensure that the amount eligible for the 25-percent tax rate is not erroneously reduced because of com-pensation for services or other specified amounts that are paid separately (or treated as separate) from the individual’s distribu-tive share of passthrough income. Net business income or loss does not in-clude specified investment-related income, deductions, or loss. Specifically, net business income does not include (1) any item taken into account in determining net long-term capital gain or net long-term capital loss, (2) dividends, income equivalent to a dividend, or payments in lieu of dividends, (3) interest income and income equivalent to interest, other than that which is properly allocable to a trade or business, (4) the excess of gain over loss from commodities transactions, other than those entered into in the normal course of the trade or business or with re-spect to stock in trade or property held pri-marily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of the trade or business, property used in the trade or business, or supplies reg-ularly used or consumed in the trade or busi-ness, (5) the excess of foreign currency gains over foreign currency losses from section 988 transactions, other than transactions di-rectly related to the business needs of the business activity, (6) net income from no-tional principal contracts, other than clearly identified hedging transactions that are treated as ordinary (i.e., not treated as cap-ital assets), and (7) any amount received from an annuity that is not used in the trade or business of the business activity. Net business income does not include any item of deduction or loss properly allocable to such income. Carryover business loss The carryover business loss from the pre-ceding taxable year reduces qualified busi-ness income in the taxable year. The carry-over business loss is the excess of (1) the sum of 100 percent of any net business loss de-rived from any passive business activity, 30 percent (except as otherwise provided under rules for determining the capital percentage, below) of any net business loss derived from any active business activity, and any carry-over business loss determined for the pre-ceding taxable year, over (2) the sum of 100 percent of any net business income derived from any passive business activity plus the capital percentage of net business income de-rived from any active business activity. There is no time limit on carryover business losses. For example, an individual has two business activities that give rise to a net business loss of 3 and 4, respectively, in year one, giving rise to a carryover business loss of 7 in year two. If in year two the two busi-ness activities each give rise to net business income of 2, a carryover business loss of 3 is carried to year three (that is, <7> ¥ (2 + 2) = <3>). Passive business activity and active business activity A business activity means an activity that involves the conduct of any trade or busi-ness. A taxpayer’s activities include those conducted through partnerships, S corpora-tions, and sole proprietorships. An activity has the same meaning as under the present- law passive loss rules (section 469). As pro-vided in regulations under those rules, a tax-payer may use any reasonable method of ap-plying the relevant facts and circumstances in grouping activities together or as separate activities (through rental activities gen-erally may not be grouped with other activi-ties unless together they constitute an ap-propriate economic unit, and grouping real property rentals with personal property rentals is not permitted). It is intended that the activity grouping the taxpayer has se-lected under the passive loss rules is required to be used for purposes of the passthrough rate rules. For example, an individual tax-payer has an interest in a bakery and a movie theater in Baltimore, and a bakery and a movie theatre in Philadelphia. For purposes of the passive loss rules, the tax-payer has grouped them as two activities, a bakery activity and a movie theatre activ-ity. The taxpayer must group them the same way that is as two activities, a bakery activ-ity and a movie theatre activity, for pur-poses of rules of this provision. Regulatory authority is provided to re-quire or permit grouping as one or as mul-tiple activities in particular circumstances, in the case of specified services activities that would be treated as a single employer under broad related party rules of present law. A passive business activity generally has the same meaning as a passive activity under the present-law passive loss rules. However, for this purpose, a passive business activity is not defined to exclude a working interest in any oil or gas property that the taxpayer holds directly or through an entity that does not limit the taxpayer’s liability. Rather, whether the taxpayer materially participates in the activity is relevant. Fur-ther, for this purpose, a passive business ac-tivity does not include an activity in connec-tion with a trade or business or in connec-tion with the production of income. An active business activity is an activity that involves the conduct of any trade or business and that is not a passive activity. For example, if an individual has a partner-ship interest in a manufacturing business and materially participates in the manufac-turing business, it is considered an active business activity of the individual. Capital percentage The capital percentage is the percentage of net business income from an active business activity that is included in qualified busi-ness income subject to Federal income tax at a rate no higher than 25 percent. In general, the capital percentage is 30 per-cent, except as provided in the case of appli-cation of an increased percentage for capital- intensive business activities, in the case of specified service activities, and in the case of application of the rule for capital-intensive specified service activities. The capital percentage is reduced if the portion of net business income represented by the sum of wages, director’s fees, guaran-teed payments and amounts received from a partnership other than in the individual’s ca-pacity as a partner, that are properly attrib-utable to a business activity exceeds the dif-ference between 100 percent and the capital percentage. For example, if net business in-come from an individual’s active business ac-tivity conducted through an S corporation is 100, including 75 of wages that the S corpora-tion pays the individual, the otherwise appli-cable capital percentage is reduced from 30 percent to 25 percent. Increased percentage for capital-intensive business activities.—A taxpayer may elect the application of an increased percentage with respect to any active business activity other than a specified service activity (described below). The election applies for the taxable year it is made and each of the next four tax-able years. The election is to be made no later than the due date (including exten-sions) of the return for the taxable year made, and is irrevocable. The percentage under the election is the applicable percent-age (described below) for the five taxable years of the election. Specified service activities.—In the case of an active business activity that is a specified service activity, generally the capital per-centage is 0 and the percentage of any net business loss from the specified service ac-tivity that is taken into account as qualified business income is 0 percent. A specified service activity means any trade or business activity involving the per-formance of services in the fields of health, law, engineering, architecture, accounting, actuarial science, performing arts, con-sulting, athletics, financial services, broker-age services, any trade or business where the principal asset of such trade or business is the reputation or skill of one or more of its employees, or investing, trading, or dealing in securities, partnership interests, or com-modities. For this purpose a security and a commodity have the meanings provided in the rules for the mark-to-market accounting method for dealers in securities (sections 475(c)(2) and 475(e)(2), respectively). Capital-intensive specified service activities. — A taxpayer may elect the application of an exception with respect to any active business activity that is specified service activity, provided the applicable percentage (de-scribed below) for the taxable year is at least 10 percent. If the election is validly made, the capital percentage and the percentage of net business loss with respect to the activity are not 0 percent, but rather, the applicable percentage for the taxable year. Calculation of applicable percentage. —The applicable percentage is the percentage ap-plied in lieu of the capital percentage in the case of either of the foregoing elections. The applicable percentage (not the capital per-centage) then determines the portion of the net business income or loss from the activity for the taxable year that is taken into ac-count in determining qualified business in-come subject to Federal income tax at a rate no higher than 25 percent. The applicable percentage is determined by dividing (1) the specified return on capital for the activity for the taxable year, by (2) the taxpayer’s net business income derived from that activity for that taxable year.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H9997 December 15, 2017 
40For purposes of this provision, taxable income is computed without regard to the 23 percent deduc-tion. 41For this purpose, section 864(c) is applied sub-stituting ‘‘qualified trade or business (within the meaning of section 199A)’’ for ‘‘nonresident alien in-dividual or a foreign corporation’’ or ‘‘a foreign cor-poration.’’ 
42Described in sec. 707(c). 
43Described in sec. 707(a). 44A similar list of service trades or business is pro-vided in section 448(d)(2)(A) and Treas. Reg. sec. 1.448–1T(e)(4)(i). For purposes of section 448, Treas-ury regulations provide that the performance of services in the field of health means the provision of medical services by physicians, nurses, dentists, and other similar healthcare professionals. The perform-ance of services in the field of health does not in-clude the provision of services not directly related to a medical field, even though the services may purportedly relate to the health of the service re-cipient. For example, the performance of services in the field of health does not include the operation of health clubs or health spas that provide physical ex-ercise or conditioning to their customers. See Treas. Reg. sec. 1.448–1T(e)(4)(ii). 
45For purposes of the similar list of services in section 448, Treasury regulations provide that the performance of services in the field of the per-forming arts means the provision of services by ac-tors, actresses, singers, musicians, entertainers, and similar artists in their capacity as such. The per-formance of services in the field of the performing arts does not include the provision of services by persons who themselves are not performing artists (e.g., persons who may manage or promote such art-ists, and other persons in a trade or business that re-lates to the performing arts). Similarly, the per-formance of services in the field of the performing arts does not include the provision of services by persons who broadcast or otherwise disseminate the performance of such artists to members of the pub-lic (e.g., employees of a radio station that broad-casts the performances of musicians and singers). See Treas. Reg. sec. 1.448–1T(e)(4)(iii). 
46For purposes of the similar list of services in section 448, Treasury regulations provide that the performance of services in the field of consulting means the provision of advice and counsel. The per-formance of services in the field of consulting does not include the performance of services other than advice and counsel, such as sales or brokerage serv-ices, or economically similar services. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the determination of whether a person’s services are sales or brokerage services, or economically similar services, shall be based on all the facts and circumstances of that per-son’s business. Such facts and circumstances in-clude, for example, the manner in which the tax-payer is compensated for the services provided ( e.g., whether the compensation for the services is contin-gent upon the consummation of the transaction that the services were intended to effect). See Treas. Reg. sec. 1.448–1T(e)(4)(iv). specified return on capital for any active business activity is determined by multi-plying a deemed rate of return, the short- term AFR plus 7 percentage points, times the asset balance for the activity for the tax-able year, and reducing the product by inter-est expense deducted with respect to the ac-tivity for the taxable year. The asset balance for this purpose is the adjusted basis of prop-erty used in connection with the activity as of the end of the taxable year, but without taking account of basis adjustments for bonus depreciation under section 168(k) or expensing under section 179. In the case of an active business activity conducted through a partnership or S corporation, the taxpayer takes into account his distributive share of the asset balance of the partnership’s or S corporation’s property used in connection with the activity. Regulatory authority is provided to ensure that in determining asset balance, no amount is taken into account for more than one activity. Effective date.—The provision is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. A transition rule provides that for fiscal year taxpayers whose taxable year in-cludes December 31, 2017, a proportional ben-efit of the reduced rate under the provision is allowed for the period beginning January 1, 2018, and ending on the day before the be-ginning of the taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  In general For taxable years beginning after Decem-ber 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026, an in-dividual taxpayer generally may deduct 23 percent of qualified business income from a partnership, S corporation, or sole propri-etorship, as well as 23 percent of aggregate qualified REIT dividends, qualified coopera-tive dividends, and qualified publicly traded partnership income. Special rules apply to specified agricultural or horticultural co-operatives. A limitation based on W–2 wages paid is phased in above a threshold amount of taxable income. A disallowance of the de-duction with respect to specified service trades or businesses is also phased in above the threshold amount of taxable income.
40 Qualified business income Qualified business income is determined for each qualified trade or business of the taxpayer. For any taxable year, qualified business income means the net amount of qualified items of income, gain, deduction, and loss with respect to the qualified trade or business of the taxpayer. The determina-tion of qualified items of income, gain, de-duction, and loss takes into account these items only to the extent included or allowed in the determination of taxable income for the year. For example, if in a taxable year, a qualified business has $100,000 of ordinary income from inventory sales, and makes an expenditure of $25,000 that is required to be capitalized and amortized over 5 years under applicable tax rules, the qualified business income is $100,000 minus $5,000 (current-year ordinary amortization deduction), or $95,000. The qualified business income is not reduced by the entire amount of the capital expendi-ture, only by the amount deductible in deter-mining taxable income for the year. If the net amount of qualified business in-come from all qualified trades or businesses during the taxable year is a loss, it is carried forward as a loss from a qualified trade or business in the next taxable year. Similar to a qualified trade or business that has a quali-fied business loss for the current taxable year, any deduction allowed in a subsequent year is reduced (but not below zero) by 23 percent of any carryover qualified business loss. For example, Taxpayer has qualified business income of $20,000 from qualified business A and a qualified business loss of $50,000 from qualified business B in Year 1. Taxpayer is not permitted a deduction for Year 1 and has a carryover qualified business loss of $30,000 to Year 2. In Year 2, Taxpayer has qualified business income of $20,000 from qualified business A and qualified business income of $50,000 from qualified business B. To determine the deduction for Year 2, Tax-payer reduces the 23 percent deductible amount determined for the qualified busi-ness income of $70,000 from qualified busi-nesses A and B by 23 percent of the $30,000 carryover qualified business loss. Domestic business Items are treated as qualified items of in-come, gain, deduction, and loss only to the extent they are effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States.41In the case of a taxpayer who is an individual with otherwise qualified business income from sources within the commonwealth of Puerto Rico, if all the in-come is taxable under section 1 (income tax rates for individuals) for the taxable year, the ‘‘United States’’ is considered to include Puerto Rico for purposes of determining the individual’s qualified business income. Treatment of investment income Qualified items do not include specified in-vestment-related income, deductions, or loss. Specifically, qualified items of income, gain, deduction and loss do not include (1) any item taken into account in determining net long-term capital gain or net long-term capital loss, (2) dividends, income equivalent to a dividend, or payments in lieu of divi-dends, (3) interest income other than that which is properly allocable to a trade or business, (4) the excess of gain over loss from commodities transactions, other than those entered into in the normal course of the trade or business or with respect to stock in trade or property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of the trade or business, property used in the trade or business, or supplies regularly used or consumed in the trade or business, (5) the ex-cess of foreign currency gains over foreign currency losses from section 988 trans-actions, other than transactions directly re-lated to the business needs of the business activity, (6) net income from notional prin-cipal contracts, other than clearly identified hedging transactions that are treated as or-dinary (i.e., not treated as capital assets), and (7) any amount received from an annuity that is not used in the trade or business of the business activity. Qualified items under this provision do not include any item of de-duction or loss properly allocable to such in-come. Reasonable compensation and guaranteed payments Qualified business income does not include any amount paid by an S corporation that is treated as reasonable compensation of the taxpayer. Similarly, qualified business in-come does not include any guaranteed pay-ment for services rendered with respect to the trade or business,
42and to the extent provided in regulations, does not include any amount paid or incurred by a partnership to a partner who is acting other than in his or her capacity as a partner for services.
43 Qualified trade or business A qualified trade or business means any trade or business other than a specified serv-ice trade or business and other than the trade or business of being an employee. Specified service business A specified service trade or business means any trade or business involving the perform-ance of services in the fields of health,44law, engineering, architecture, accounting, actu-arial science, performing arts,
45consulting,46 athletics, financial services, brokerage serv-ices, including investing and investment management, trading, or dealing in securi-ties, partnership interests, or commodities, and any trade or business where the prin-cipal asset of such trade or business is the reputation or skill of one or more of its em-ployees. For this purpose a security and a commodity have the meanings provided in the rules for the mark-to-market accounting method for dealers in securities (sections 475(c)(2) and 475(e)(2), respectively). Phase-in of specified service business limita-tion The exclusion from the definition of a qualified business for specified service trades or businesses phases in for a taxpayer with taxable income in excess of a threshold amount. The threshold amount is $250,000 (200 percent of that amount, or $500,000, in the case of a joint return) (the ‘‘threshold amount’’). The threshold amount is indexed for inflation. The exclusion from the defini-tion of a qualified business for specified serv-ice trades or businesses is fully phased in for a taxpayer with taxable income in excess of the threshold amount plus $50,000 ($100,000 in

51In the case of a taxpayer with a short taxable year that does not contain a calendar year ending during such short taxable year, the Committee in-tends that the following amounts shall be treated as the W–2 wages of the taxpayer for the short taxable year: (1) only those wages paid during the short tax-able year to employees of the qualified trade or busi-ness, (2) only those elective deferrals (within the meaning of section 402(g)(3)) made during the short taxable year by employees of the qualified trade or business, and (3) only compensation actually de-ferred under section 457 during the short taxable year with respect to employees of the qualified trade or business. The Committee intends that amounts that are treated as W–2 wages for a taxable year shall not be treated as W–2 wages of any other tax-able year.

In computing the qualified business in-come with respect to a specified service trade or business, the taxpayer takes into account only the applicable percentage of qualified items of income, gain, deduction, or loss, and of allocable W–2 wages. The ap-plicable percentage with respect to any tax-able year is 100 percent reduced by the per-centage equal to the ratio of the excess of the taxable income of the taxpayer over the threshold amount bears to $50,000 ($100,000 in the case of a joint return). For example, Taxpayer has taxable income of $280,000, of which $200,000 is attributable to an accounting sole proprietorship after pay-ing wages of $100,000 to employees. Taxpayer has an applicable percentage of 40 percent.
47 In determining includible qualified business income, Taxpayer takes into account 40 per-cent of $200,000, or $80,000. In determining the includible W–2 wages, Taxpayer takes into account 40 percent of $100,000, or $40,000. Tax-payer calculates the deduction by taking the lesser of 23 percent of $80,000 ($18,400) or 50 percent of $40,000 ($20,000). Taxpayer takes a deduction for $18,400. Tentative deductible amount for a qualified trade or business In general For each qualified trade or business, the taxpayer is allowed a deductible amount equal to the lesser of 23 percent of the quali-fied business income with respect to such trade or business or 50 percent of the W–2 wages with respect to such business (the ‘‘wage limit’’). However, if the taxpayer’s taxable income is below the threshold amount, the deductible amount for each qualified trade or business is equal to 23 per-cent of the qualified business income with respect to each respective trade or business. W–2 wages W–2 wages are the total wages
48subject to wage withholding, elective deferrals,
49and deferred compensation
50paid by the quali-fied trade or business with respect to em-ployment of its employees during the cal-endar year ending during the taxable year of the taxpayer.
51W–2 wages do not include any amount which is not properly allocable to the qualified business income as a qualified item of deduction. In addition, W–2 wages do not include any amount which was not prop-erly included in a return filed with the So-cial Security Administration on or before the 60th day after the due date (including ex-tensions) for such return. In the case of a taxpayer who is an indi-vidual with otherwise qualified business in-come from sources within the common-wealth of Puerto Rico, if all the income is taxable under section 1 (income tax rates for individuals) for the taxable year, the deter-mination of W–2 wages with respect to the taxpayer’s trade or business conducted in Puerto Rico is made without regard to any exclusion under the wage withholding rules52 for remuneration paid for services in Puerto Rico. Phase-in of wage limit The application of the wage limit phases in for a taxpayer with taxable income in excess of the threshold amount. The wage limit ap-plies fully for a taxpayer with taxable in-come in excess of the threshold amount plus $50,000 ($100,000 in the case of a joint return). For a taxpayer with taxable income within the phase-in range, the wage limit applies as follows. With respect to any qualified trade or busi-ness, the taxpayer compares (1) 23 percent of the taxpayer’s qualified business income with respect to the qualified trade or busi-ness with (2) 50 percent of the W–2 wages with respect to the qualified trade or busi-ness. If the amount determined under (2) is less than the amount determined (1), (that is, if the wage limit is binding), the tax-payer’s deductible amount is the amount de-termined under (1) reduced by the same pro-portion of the difference between the two amounts as the excess of the taxable income of the taxpayer over the threshold amount bears to $50,000 ($100,000 in the case of a joint return). For example, H and W file a joint return on which they report taxable income of $520,000. W has a qualified trade or business that is not a specified service business, such that 23 percent of the qualified business income with respect to the business is $15,000. W’s share of wages paid by the business is $20,000, such that 50 percent of the W–2 wages with respect to the business is $10,000. The $15,000 amount is reduced by 20 percent
53of the difference between $15,000 and $10,000, or $1,000. H and W take a deduction for $14,000. Qualified REIT dividends, cooperative divi-dends, and publicly traded partnership income A deduction is allowed under the provision for 23 percent of the taxpayer’s aggregate amount of qualified REIT dividends, quali-fied cooperative dividends, and qualified pub-licly traded partnership income for the tax-able year. Qualified REIT dividends do not include any portion of a dividend received from a REIT that is a capital gain dividend
54 or a qualified dividend.
55A qualified coopera-tive dividend means a patronage dividend,
56 per-unit retain allocation,
57qualified written notice of allocation,
58or any similar amount, provided it is includible in gross in-come and is received from either (1) a tax-ex-empt benevolent life insurance association, mutual ditch or irrigation company, cooper-ative telephone company, like cooperative organization,
59or a taxable or tax-exempt cooperative that is described in section 1381(a), or (2) a taxable cooperative governed by tax rules applicable to cooperatives be-fore the enactment of subchapter T of the Code in 1962. Qualified publicly traded part-nership income means (with respect to any qualified trade or business of the taxpayer), the sum of the (a) the net amount of the tax-payer’s allocable share of each qualified item of income, gain, deduction, and loss (that are effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business and are included or allowed in de-termining taxable income for the taxable year and do not constitute excepted enumer-ated investment-type income, and not in-cluding the taxpayer’s reasonable compensa-tion, guaranteed payments for services, or (to the extent provided in regulations) sec-tion 707(a) payments for services) from a publicly traded partnership not treated as a corporation, and (b) gain recognized by the taxpayer on disposition of its interest in the partnership that is treated as ordinary in-come (for example, by reason of section 751). Determination of the taxpayer’s deduction The taxpayer’s deduction for qualified business income is equal to the lesser of the combined qualified business income amount for the taxable year or an amount equal to 23 percent of the taxpayer’s taxable income (re-duced by any net capital gain60) for the tax-able year. The combined qualified business income amount is the sum of the deductible amounts determined for each qualified trade or business for the taxable year and 23 per-cent of the qualified REIT dividends and qualified cooperative dividends received by the taxpayer for the taxable year. Specified agricultural or horticultural co-operatives For taxable years beginning after Decem-ber 31, 2018 but not after December 31, 2025, a deduction is allowed to any specified agricul-tural or horticultural cooperative equal to the lesser of 23 percent of the cooperative’s taxable income for the taxable year or 50 percent of the W–2 wages paid by the cooper-ative with respect to its trade or business. A specified agricultural or horticultural coop-erative is a organization to which subchapter T applies that is engaged in (a) the manufac-turing, production, growth, or extraction in whole or significant part of any agricultural or horticultural product, (b) the marketing of agricultural or horticultural products that its patrons have so manufactured, pro-duced, grown, or extracted, or (c) the provi-sion of supplies, equipment, or services to farmers or organizations described in the foregoing. Special rules and definitions For purposes of the provision, taxable in-come is determined without regard to the de-duction allowable under the provision. In the case of a partnership or S corpora-tion, the provision applies at the partner or shareholder level. Each partner takes into account the partner’s allocable share of each qualified item of income, gain, deduction, and loss, and is treated as having W–2 wages for the taxable year equal to the partner’s allocable share of W–2 wages of the partner-ship. The partner’s allocable share of W–2 wages is required to be determined in the same manner as the partner’s share of wage expenses. For example, if a partner is allo-cated a deductible amount of 10 percent of wages paid by the partnership to employees for the taxable year, the partner is required to be allocated 10 percent of the W–2 wages of the partnership for purposes of calculating the wage limit under this deduction. Simi-larly, each shareholder of an S corporation takes into account the shareholder’s pro rata share of each qualified item of income, gain, deduction, and loss, and is treated as having W–2 wages for the taxable year equal to the shareholder’s pro rata share of W–2 wages of the S corporation. Qualified business income is determined without regard to any adjustments pre-scribed under the rules of the alternative minimum tax. The provision does not apply to a trust or estate.

68Although H and W’s taxable income is above the threshold amount for a joint return, the wage limit is not binding as the 23 percent of includible quali-fied business income of qualified business B ($59,800) is less than 50 percent of includible W–2 wages of qualified business B ($60,000). The deduction under the provision is al-lowed only for Federal income tax purposes. For purposes of determining a substantial underpayment of income tax under the accu-racy related penalty,
61a substantial under-payment exists if the amount of the under-statement exceeds the greater of five percent (not 10 percent) of the tax required to be shown on the return or $5,000. Authority is provided to promulgate regu-lations needed to carry out the purposes of the provision, including regulations requir-ing, or restricting, the allocation of items of income, gain, loss, or deduction, or of wages under the provision. In addition, regulatory authority is provided to address reporting re-quirements appropriate under the provision, and the application of the provision in the case of tiered entities. The provision does not apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025. Additional examples The following examples provide a com-prehensive illustration of the provision. Example 1 H and W file a joint return on which they report taxable income of $520,000 (determined without regard to this provision). H is a part-ner in a qualified trade or business that is not a specified service business (‘‘qualified business A’’). W has a sole proprietorship qualified trade or business that is a specified service business (‘‘qualified business B’’). H and W also received $10,000 in qualified REIT dividends during the tax year. H’s allocable share of qualified business in-come from qualified business A is $300,000, such that 23 percent of the qualified business income with respect to the business is $69,000.
62H’s allocable share of wages paid by qualified business A is $100,000, such that 50 percent of the W–2 wages with respect to the business is $50,000.
63As H and W’s taxable in-come is above the threshold amount for a joint return, the application of the wage limit for qualified business A is phased in. Accordingly, the $69,000 amount is reduced by 20 percent
64of the difference between $69,000 and $50,000, or $3,800.
65H’s deductible amount for qualified business A is $65,200.
66 W’s qualified business income and W–2 wages from qualified business B, which is a specified service business, are $325,000 and $150,000, respectively. H and W’s taxable in-come is above the threshold amount for a joint return. Thus, the exclusion of qualified business income and W–2 wages from the specified service business are phased in. W has an applicable percentage of 80 percent.
67 In determining includible qualified business income, W takes into account 80 percent of $325,000, or $260,000. In determining includible W–2 wages, W takes into account 80 percent of $150,000, or $120,000. W calculates the de-ductible amount for qualified business B by taking the lesser of 23 percent of $260,000 ($59,800) or 50 percent of includible W–2 wages of $120,000 ($60,000).
68W’s deductible amount for qualified business B is $59,800. H and W’s combined qualified business in-come amount of $127,300 is comprised of the deductible amount for qualified business A of $65,200, the deductible amount for qualified business B of $59,800, and 23 percent of the $10,000 qualified REIT dividends ($2,300). H and W’s deduction is limited to 23 percent of their taxable income for the year ($520,000), or $119,600. Accordingly, H and W’s deduction for the taxable year is $119,600. Example 2 H and W file a joint return on which they report taxable income of $200,000 (determined without regard to this provision). H has a sole proprietorship qualified trade or busi-ness that is not a specified service business (‘‘qualified business A’’). W is a partner in a qualified trade or business that is not a spec-ified service business (‘‘qualified business B’’). H and W have a carryover qualified busi-ness loss of $50,000. H’s qualified business income from quali-fied business A is $150,000, such that 23 per-cent of the qualified business income with respect to the business is $34,500. As H and W’s taxable income is below the threshold amount for a joint return, the wage limit does not apply to qualified business A. H’s deductible amount for qualified business A is $34,500. W’s allocable share of qualified business loss is $40,000, such that 23 percent of the qualified business loss with respect to the business is $9,200. As H and W’s taxable in-come is below the threshold amount for a joint return, the wage limit does not apply to qualified business B. W’s deductible amount for qualified business B is a reduc-tion to the deduction of $9,200. H and W’s combined qualified business in-come amount of $13,800 is comprised of the deductible amount for qualified business A of $34,500, the reduction to the deduction for qualified business B of $9,200, and the reduc-tion to the deduction of $11,500 attributable to the carryover qualified business loss. H and W’s deduction is limited to 23 percent of their taxable income for the year ($200,000), or $46,000. Accordingly, H and W’s deduction for the taxable year is $13,800. Effective date.—The provision is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the Sen-ate amendment with modifications. Deduction percentage Under the conference agreement, the per-centage of the deduction allowable under the provision is 20 percent (not 23 percent). Threshold amount The conference agreement reduces the threshold amount above which both the limi-tation on specified service businesses and the wage limit are phased in. Under the con-ference agreement, the threshold amount is $157,500 (twice that amount or $315,000 in the case of a joint return), indexed. The con-ferees expect that the reduced threshold amount will serve to deter high-income tax-payers from attempting to convert wages or other compensation for personal services to income eligible for the 20-percent deduction under the provision. The conference agreement provides that the range over which the phase-in of these limitations applies is $50,000 ($100,000 in the case of a joint return). Limitation based on W–2 wages and capital The conference agreement modifies the wage limit applicable to taxpayers with tax-able income above the threshold amount to provide a limit based either on wages paid or on wages paid plus a capital element. Under the conference agreement, the limitation is the greater of (a) 50 percent of the W–2 wages paid with respect to the qualified trade or business, or (b) the sum of 25 of percent of the W–2 wages with respect to the qualified trade or business plus 2.5 percent of the unadjusted basis, immediately after acquisi-tion, of all qualified property. For purposes of the provision, qualified property means tangible property of a char-acter subject to depreciation that is held by, and available for use in, the qualified trade or business at the close of the taxable year, and which is used in the production of quali-fied business income, and for which the de-preciable period has not ended before the close of the taxable year. The depreciable pe-riod with respect to qualified property of a taxpayer means the period beginning on the date the property is first placed in service by the taxpayer and ending on the later of (a) the date 10 years after that date, or (b) the last day of the last full year in the applicable recovery period that would apply to the property under section 168 (without regard to section 168(g)). For example, a taxpayer (who is subject to the limit) does business as a sole proprietor-ship conducting a widget-making business. The business buys a widget-making machine for $100,000 and places it in service in 2020. The business has no employees in 2020. The limitation in 2020 is the greater of (a) 50 per-cent of W–2 wages, or $0, or (b) the sum of 25 percent of W–2 wages ($0) plus 2.5 percent of the unadjusted basis of the machine imme-diately after its acquisition: $100,000 × .025 = $2,500. The amount of the limitation on the taxpayer’s deduction is $2,500. In the case of property that is sold, for ex-ample, the property is no longer available for use in the trade or business and is not taken into account in determining the limitation. The Secretary is required to provide rules for applying the limitation in cases of a short taxable year of where the taxpayer acquires, or disposes of, the major portion of a trade or business or the major portion of a sepa-rate unit of a trade or business during the year. The Secretary is required to provide guidance applying rules similar to the rules of section 179(d)(2) to address acquisitions of property from a related party, as well as in a sale-leaseback or other transaction as needed to carry out the purposes of the pro-vision and to provide anti-abuse rules, in-cluding under the limitation based on W–2 wages and capital. Similarly, the Secretary shall provide guidance prescribing rules for determining the unadjusted basis imme-diately after acquisition of qualified prop-erty acquired in like-kind exchanges or in-voluntary conversions as needed to carry out the purposes of the provision and to provide anti-abuse rules, including under the limita-tion based on W–2 wages and capital. Specified service trade or business The conference agreement modifies the definition of a specified service trade or busi-ness in several respects. The definition is modified to exclude engineering and archi-tecture services, and to take into account the reputation or skill of owners. A specified service trade or business means any trade or business involving the perform-ance of services in the fields of health, law, consulting, athletics, financial services, bro-kerage services, or any trade or business where the principal asset of such trade or business is the reputation or skill of one or more of its employees or owners, or which involves the performance of services that consist of investing and investment manage-ment trading, or dealing in securities, part-nership interests, or commodities. For this purpose a security and a commodity have the meanings provided in the rules for the mark-to-market accounting method for deal-ers in securities (sections 475(c)(2) and 475(e)(2), respectively). Determination of the taxpayer’s deduction The taxpayer’s deduction for qualified business income for the taxable year is equal

69and quali- fied cooperative dividends, plus (b) the lesser of 20 percent of qualified cooperative divi-dends and taxable income (reduced by net capital gain). This sum may not exceed the taxpayer’s taxable income for the taxable year (reduced by net capital gain). Under the provision, the 20-percent deduction with re-spect to qualified cooperative dividends is limited to taxable income (reduced by net capital gain) for the year. The combined qualified business income amount for the taxable year is the sum of the deductible amounts determined for each qualified trade or business carried on by the taxpayer and 20 percent of the taxpayer’s qualified REIT dividends and qualified publicly traded part-nership income. The deductible amount for each qualified trade or business is the lesser of (a) 20 percent of the taxpayer’s qualified business income with respect to the trade or business, or (b) the greater of 50 percent of the W–2 wages with respect to the trade or business or the sum of 25 percent of the W– 2 wages with respect to the trade or business and 2.5 percent of the unadjusted basis, im-mediately after acquisition, of all qualified property. Deduction against taxable income The conference agreement clarifies that the 20-percent deduction is not allowed in computing adjusted gross income, and in-stead is allowed as a deduction reducing tax-able income. Thus, for example, the provi-sion does not affect limitations based on ad-justed gross income. Similarly the con-ference agreement clarifies that the deduc-tion is available to both non-itemizers and itemizers. Treatment of agricultural and horticultural cooperatives For taxable years beginning after Decem-ber 31, 2017 but not after December 31, 2025, a deduction is allowed to any specified agricul-tural or horticultural cooperative equal to the lesser of (a) 20 percent of the coopera-tive’s taxable income for the taxable year or (b) the greater of 50 percent of the W–2 wages paid by the cooperative with respect to its trade or business or the sum of 25 percent of the W–2 wages of the cooperative with re-spect to its trade or business plus 2.5 percent of the unadjusted basis immediately after acquisition of qualified property of the coop-erative. A specified agricultural or horti-cultural cooperative is a organization to which subchapter T applies that is engaged in (a) the manufacturing, production, growth, or extraction in whole or significant part of any agricultural or horticultural product, (b) the marketing of agricultural or horticultural products that its patrons have so manufactured, produced, grown, or ex-tracted, or (c) the provision of supplies, equipment, or services to farmers or organi-zations described in the foregoing. Treatment of trusts and estates The conference agreement provides that trusts and estates are eligible for the 20-per-cent deduction under the provision. Rules similar to the rules under present-law sec-tion 199 (as in effect on December 1, 2017) apply for apportioning between fiduciaries and beneficiaries any W–2 wages and unadjusted basis of qualified property under the limitation based on W–2 wages and cap-ital. Effective date.—The provision is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. C. Simplification and Reform of Family and Individual Tax Credits 1. Enhancement of child tax credit and new family credit (sec. 1101 of the House bill, sec. 11022 of the Senate amendment, and sec. 24 of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  An individual may claim a tax credit for each qualifying child under the age of 17. The amount of the credit per child is $1,000. A child who is not a citizen, national, or resi-dent of the United States cannot be a quali-fying child. The aggregate amount of child credits that may be claimed is phased out for individuals with income over certain threshold amounts. Specifically, the otherwise allowable child tax credit is reduced by $50 for each $1,000 (or fraction thereof) of modified adjusted gross income (‘‘AGI’’) over $75,000 for single indi-viduals or heads of households, $110,000 for married individuals filing joint returns, and $55,000 for married individuals filing separate returns. For purposes of this limitation, modified AGI includes certain otherwise ex-cludable income earned by U.S. citizens or residents living abroad or in certain U.S. ter-ritories. The credit is allowable against both the regular tax and the alternative minimum tax (‘‘AMT’’). To the extent the child credit ex-ceeds the taxpayer’s tax liability, the tax-payer is eligible for a refundable credit
70 (the ‘‘additional child tax credit’’) equal to 15 percent of earned income in excess of $3,000 (the ‘‘earned income’’ formula). Families with three or more children may determine the additional child tax credit using the ‘‘alternative formula,’’ if this re-sults in a larger credit than determined under the earned income formula. Under the alternative formula, the additional child tax credit equals the amount by which the tax-payer’s Social Security taxes exceed the tax-payer’s earned income credit (‘‘EIC’’). Earned income is defined as the sum of wages, salaries, tips, and other taxable em-ployee compensation plus net self-employ-ment earnings. At the taxpayer’s election, combat pay may be treated as earned income for these purposes. Unlike the EIC, which also includes the preceding items in its defi-nition of earned income, the additional child tax credit is based only on earned income to the extent it is included in computing tax-able income. For example, some ministers’ parsonage allowances are considered self-em-ployment income, and thus are considered earned income for purposes of computing the EIC, but the allowances are excluded from gross income for individual income tax pur-poses, and thus are not considered earned in-come for purposes of the additional child tax credit since the income is not included in taxable income. Any credit or refund allowed or made to an individual under this provision (including to any resident of a U.S. possession) is not taken into account as income and is not be taken into account as resources for the month of receipt and the following two months for purposes of determining eligi-bility of such individual or any other indi-vidual for benefits or assistance, or the amount or extent of benefits or assistance, under any Federal program or under any State or local program financed in whole or in part with Federal funds. 
HOUSE BILL  The provision expands the child tax credit into a new family tax credit. The family credit consists of a $1,600 credit per quali-fying child under the age of 17, and a $300 credit for each of the taxpayer (both spouses in the case of married taxpayers filing a joint return) and each dependent of the tax-payer who is not a qualifying child under age 17. The provision generally retains the present-law definition of dependent. How-ever, under the provision, a qualifying child is eligible for the $1,600 credit only if such child is a citizen or national of the United States. The family credit phases out at AGI of $230,000 for married taxpayers filing joint re-turns and $115,000 for other individuals. The credit is refundable under rules similar to the present law additional child tax credit. That is, to the extent the credit exceeds the taxpayer’s tax liability, the taxpayer is eli-gible for a refundable credit equal to 15 per-cent of earned income in excess of $3,000.71 The refundable credit is limited to $1,000 times the number of qualifying children under the age of 17 claimed on the return. This $1,000 per child dollar limitation is in-dexed for inflation, with a base year of 2017, rounding up to the nearest $100. Accordingly, in 2018 the limitation will be $1,100. The provision requires that the taxpayer include the name and taxpayer identification number of each qualifying child and depend-ent on the tax return for each taxable year.
72 The $300 credit for the taxpayer, spouse, and non-child dependents of the taxpayer ex-pires for taxable years beginning after De-cember 31, 2022. Effective date.—The provision is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The provision temporarily increases the child tax credit to $2,000 per qualifying child. Additionally, the age limit for a qualifying child is temporarily increased by one year, such that a taxpayer may claim the credit with respect to any qualifying child under the age of 18. This increase in the age limit expires for taxable years after December 31, 2024. The credit is further modified to tempo-rarily provide for a $500 nonrefundable credit for qualifying dependents other than quali-fying children. The provision generally re-tains the present-law definition of depend-ent. Under the temporary provision, beginning in 2018, the threshold at which the credit be-gins to phase out is increased to $500,000 for all taxpayers. These amounts are not in-dexed for inflation. The provision temporarily lowers the earned income threshold for the refundable child tax credit to $2,500. As under present law, the maximum amount refundable may not exceed $1,000 per qualifying child. Under the provision, this $1,000 threshold is indexed for inflation with a base year of 2017, round-ing up to the nearest $100 (such that the threshold is $1,100 in 2018). A temporary rule provides that, for the taxable years for which the above-described changes are in effect, in order to receive the refundable portion of the child tax credit, a taxpayer must include a Social Security number for each qualifying child for whom the credit is claimed on the tax return. The temporary provision (other than the increase in the age limit, which expires one year earlier) expires for taxable years begin-ning after December 31, 2025. Effective date.—The provision is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H10001 December 15, 2017 
73Unlike both the House bill and the Senate amendment, the conference agreement uses an in-dexing convention that rounds the $1,400 amount to the next lowest multiple of $100. 
74Additionally, a qualifying child who is ineligible to receive the child tax credit because that child did not have a Social Security number as the child’s taxpayer identification number may nonetheless qualify for the non-refundable $500 credit.

81Sec. 25. 
82Sec. 143. 83Earned income is defined as (1) wages, salaries, tips, and other employee compensation, but only if such amounts are includible in gross income, plus (2) the amount of the individual’s net self-employment earnings. 
84See description of sec. 1101 of the House bill for the House bill and Senate amendment modifications to the child tax credit. CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement temporarily in-creases the child tax credit to $2,000 per qualifying child. The credit is further modi-fied to temporarily provide for a $500 non-refundable credit for qualifying dependents other than qualifying children. The provision generally retains the present-law definition of dependent. Under the conference agreement, the max-imum amount refundable may not exceed $1,400 per qualifying child.
73Additionally, the conference agreement provides that, in order to receive the child tax credit (i.e., both the refundable and non-refundable por-tion), a taxpayer must include a Social Secu-rity number for each qualifying child for whom the credit is claimed on the tax re-turn. For these purposes, a Social Security number must be issued before the due date for the filing of the return for the taxable year. This requirement does not apply to a non-child dependent for whom the $500 non- refundable credit is claimed.
74 Further, the conference agreement retains the present-law age limit for a qualifying child. Thus, a qualifying child is an indi-vidual who has not attained age 17 during the taxable year. Finally, the conference agreement modi-fies the adjusted gross income phaseout thresholds. Under the conference agreement, the credit begins to phase out for taxpayers with adjusted gross income in excess of $400,000 (in the case of married taxpayers fil-ing a joint return) and $200,000 (for all other taxpayers). These phaseout thresholds are not indexed for inflation. As was the case with the Senate amend-ment, the provision expires for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025. Effective date.—The provision is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 2. Credit for the elderly and permanently dis-abled (sec. 1102(a) of the House bill and sec. 22 of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  Certain taxpayers who are over the age of 65 or retired on account of permanent and total disability may claim a nonrefundable credit. The maximum credit is 15 percent of $5,000 for a return where one individual qualifies and $7,500 on a joint return where both spouses qualify.
75Thus, the maximum credit amounts are $750 and $1,125, respec-tively. The credit base is reduced by one half of the amount by which the taxpayer’s adjusted gross income exceeds $7,500 if the taxpayer is unmarried, $10,000 if the taxpayer is married and files a joint return, or $5,000 if the tax-payer is married and files a separate re-turn.
76Thus, the credit base is phased down to zero when adjusted gross income exceeds $17,500 for an unmarried person, $20,000 for a married couple filing a joint return where only one spouse qualifies for the credit, $25,000 for a joint return where both spouses qualify, and $12,500 for a married person fil-ing a separate return. Additionally, the credit base is reduced by certain items of income otherwise exempt from tax: (1) benefits under Title II of the Social Security Act; (2) retirement benefits under the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974; (3) disability benefits paid by the Veterans Administration, except for benefits payable on account of personal injuries or sickness resulting from active service in the Armed Forces; and (4) pensions, annuities, and dis-ability benefits exempted from tax by any provision not in the Code.77 To qualify for the credit, a taxpayer must, at the end of the taxable year, be at least 65 years old or retired on account of permanent and total disability.
78Permanent and total disability exists if, at the time of retire-ment, the taxpayer was ‘‘unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or men-tal impairment which can be expected to re-sult in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.

HOUSE BILL  The House bill repeals the credit for the el-derly and permanently disabled. Effective date.—The provision applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  No provision. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement does not include the House bill provision. 3. Repeal of credit for plug-in electric drive motor vehicles (sec. 1102(c) of the House bill and sec. 30D of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  A credit is available for new four-wheeled vehicles (excluding low speed vehicles and vehicles weighing 14,000 pounds or more) pro-pelled by a battery with at least 4 kilowatt- hours of electricity that can be charged from an external source.
80The base credit is $2,500 plus $417 for each kilowatt-hour of additional battery capacity in excess of 4 kilowatt- hours (for a maximum credit of $7,500). Qualified vehicles are subject to a 200,000 ve-hicle-per-manufacturer limitation. Once the limitation has been reached the credit is phased down over four calendar quarters. 
HOUSE BILL  The provision repeals the credit for plug-in electric drive motor vehicles. Effective date.—The provision is effective for vehicles placed in service in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  No provision. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement does not include the House bill provision. 4. Termination of credit for interest on cer-tain home mortgages (sec. 1102(b) of the House bill and sec. 25 of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  Qualified governmental units can elect to exchange all or a portion of their qualified mortgage bond authority for authority to issue mortgage credit certificates (‘‘MCCs’’).
81MCCs entitle homebuyers to a nonrefundable income tax credit for a speci-fied percentage of interest paid on mortgage loans on their principal residences. The tax credit provided by the MCC may be carried forward three years. Once issued, an MCC generally remains in effect as long as the residence being financed is the certificate-re-cipient’s principal residence. MCCs generally are subject to the same eligibility and tar-geted area requirements as qualified mort-gage bonds.
82 HOUSE BILL  No credit is allowed with respect to any MCC issued after December 31, 2017. Effective date.—The provision applies to taxable years ending after December 31, 2017. Credits continue for interest paid on mort-gage loans on principal residences for which MCCs have been issued on or before Decem-ber 31, 2017. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  No Provision. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement does not contain the House bill provision. 5. Modification of taxpayer identification number requirements for the child tax credit, earned income credit, and Amer-ican Opportunity credit (sec. 1103 of the House bill, sec. 11022 of the Senate amendment and secs. 24, 25A and 32 of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  Earned income credit Low and moderate-income taxpayers may be eligible for the refundable earned income credit (‘‘EIC’’). Eligibility for the EIC is based on the taxpayer’s earned income, ad-justed gross income, investment income, fil-ing status, and work status in the United States. The amount of the EIC is based on the presence and number of qualifying chil-dren in the worker’s family, as well as on ad-justed gross income and earned income. The earned income credit generally equals a specified percentage of earned income
83up to a maximum dollar amount. The maximum amount applies over a certain income range and then diminishes to zero over a specified phase-out range. For taxpayers with earned income (or adjusted gross income (‘‘AGI’’), if greater) in excess of the beginning of the phase-out range, the maximum EIC amount is reduced by the phase-out rate multiplied by the amount of earned income (or AGI, if greater) in excess of the beginning of the phase-out range. For taxpayers with earned income (or AGI, if greater) in excess of the end of the phase-out range, no credit is al-lowed. An individual is not eligible for the EIC if the aggregate amount of disqualified income of the taxpayer for the taxable year exceeds $3,450 (for 2017). This threshold is indexed for inflation. Disqualified income is the sum of: (1) interest (taxable and tax-exempt); (2) dividends; (3) net rent and royalty income (if greater than zero); (4) capital gains net in-come; and (5) net passive income (if greater than zero) that is not self-employment in-come. The EIC is a refundable credit, meaning that if the amount of the credit exceeds the taxpayer’s Federal income tax liability, the excess is payable to the taxpayer as a direct transfer payment. Child tax credit
84 An individual may claim a tax credit of $1,000 for each qualifying child under the age of 17. A child who is not a citizen, national, or resident of the United States cannot be a qualifying child. The aggregate amount of allowable child credits is phased out for individuals with in-come over certain threshold amounts. Spe-cifically, the otherwise allowable aggregate child tax credit (‘‘CTC’’) amount is reduced by $50 for each $1,000 (or fraction thereof) of

Employment taxes also include taxes under the Railroad Retirement Act (‘‘RRTA’’), sec-tions 3201–3241, and tax under the Federal Unemploy-ment Taxes Act (‘‘FUTA’’), sections 3301–3311.

For purposes of this limitation, modified AGI includes certain otherwise excludable income
85earned by U.S. citizens or residents living abroad or in certain U.S. territories. The child tax credit is allowable against both the regular tax and the alternative minimum tax (‘‘AMT’’). To the extent the credit exceeds the taxpayer’s tax liability, the taxpayer is eligible for a refundable cred-it (the ‘‘additional child tax credit’’) equal to 15 percent of earned income in excess of a threshold dollar amount of $3,000 (the ‘‘earned income’’ formula). Families with three or more qualifying children may determine the additional child tax credit using the ‘‘alternative formula’’ if this results in a larger credit than deter-mined under the earned income formula. Under the alternative formula, the addi-tional child tax credit equals the amount by which the taxpayer’s Social Security taxes exceed the taxpayer’s EIC. As with the EIC, earned income is defined as the sum of wages, salaries, tips, and other taxable employee compensation plus net self-employment earnings. Unlike the EIC, the additional child tax credit is based on earned income only to the extent it is in-cluded in computing taxable income. For ex-ample, some ministers’ parsonage allowances are considered self-employment income and thus are considered earned income for pur-poses of computing the EIC, but the allow-ances are excluded from gross income for in-dividual income tax purposes and thus are not considered earned income for purposes of the additional child tax credit. American Opportunity credit
86 The American Opportunity credit provides individuals with a tax credit of up to $2,500 per eligible student per year for qualified tuition and related expenses (including course materials) paid for each of the first four years of the student’s post-secondary education in a degree or certificate program. The credit rate is 100 percent on the first $2,000 of qualified tuition and related ex-penses, and 25 percent on the next $2,000 of qualified tuition and related expenses. The American Opportunity credit is phased out ratably for taxpayers with modified AGI between $80,000 and $90,000 ($160,000 and $180,000 for married taxpayers filing a joint return). The credit may be claimed against a taxpayer’s AMT liability. Forty percent of a taxpayer’s otherwise al-lowable modified credit is refundable. A re-fundable credit is a credit which, if the amount of the credit exceeds the taxpayer’s Federal income tax liability, the excess is payable to the taxpayer as a direct transfer payment. No credit is allowed to a taxpayer who fails to include the taxpayer identification num-ber of the student to whom the qualified tui-tion and related expenses relate. Taxpayer identification number requirements Any individual filing a U.S. tax return is required to state his or her taxpayer identi-fication number on such return. Generally, a taxpayer identification number is the indi-vidual’s Social Security number (‘‘SSN’’).
87 However, in the case of an individual who is not eligible to be issued an SSN, but who has a tax filing obligation, the Internal Revenue Service (‘‘IRS’’) issues an individual tax-payer identification number (‘‘ITIN’’) for use in connection with the individual’s tax filing requirements.88An individual who is eligible to receive an SSN may not obtain an ITIN for purposes of his or her tax filing obliga-tions.
89An ITIN does not provide eligibility to work in the United States or claim Social Security benefits. Examples of individuals who are not eligi-ble for SSNs, but potentially need ITINs in order to file U.S. returns include a non-resident alien filing a claim for a reduced withholding rate under a U.S. income tax treaty, a nonresident alien required to file a U.S. tax return,
90an individual who is a U.S. resident alien under the substantial presence test and who therefore must file a U.S. tax return,
91a dependent or spouse of the prior two categories of individuals, or a dependent or spouse of a nonresident alien visa holder. An individual is ineligible for the EIC (but not the child tax credit) if he or she does not include a valid SSN and the qualifying child’s valid SSN (and, if married, the spouse’s SSN) on his or her tax return. For these purposes, the Code defines an SSN as a Social Security number issued to an indi-vidual, other than an SSN issued to an indi-vidual solely for the purpose of applying for or receiving federally funded benefits.
92If an individual fails to provide a correct taxpayer identification number, such omission will be treated as a mathematical or clerical error by the IRS. A taxpayer who resides with a qualifying child may not claim the EIC with respect to the qualifying child if such child does not have a valid SSN. The taxpayer also is ineli-gible for the EIC for workers without chil-dren because he or she resides with a quali-fying child. However, if a taxpayer has two or more qualifying children, some of whom do not have a valid SSN, the taxpayer may claim the EIC based on the number of quali-fying children for whom there are valid SSNs. 
HOUSE BILL  Under the provision, any qualifying child claimed by the taxpayer on the tax return must use, as that child’s identifying number, a Social Security number that is valid for employment in the United States in order to be eligible for the CTC. Under the provision, if a child’s identifying number was other than a Social Security number (such as an ITIN), the taxpayer would be eligible to re-ceive the $300 credit for dependents other than qualifying children, assuming such child otherwise qualified as a dependent of the taxpayer.
93 Additionally, under the provision, tax-payers who use as their taxpayer identifica-tion number a Social Security number issued for non-work reasons, such as for purposes of receiving Federal benefits or for any other reason, are not eligible for the EIC. Lastly, under the provision, in order to claim the American Opportunity credit, the identification number provided with respect to the student to whom the tuition and re-lated expenses relate must be a Social Secu-rity number. Effective date.—The provision is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. SENATE AMENDMENT  Under the Senate amendment, as a part of the temporary modifications to the child tax credit, for the taxable years 2018 through 2025, in order to receive the refundable por-tion of the child tax credit, a taxpayer must include a Social Security number for each qualifying child for whom the credit is claimed on the tax return. Effective date.—The provision is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017.

94 6. Procedures to reduce improper claims of earned income credit (sec. 1104 of the House bill and new secs. 32(c)(2)(B)(vii) and 6011(i) of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  Earned income credit Low- and moderate-income workers may be eligible for the refundable earned income credit (‘‘EIC’’). Eligibility for the EIC is based on earned income, adjusted gross in-come (‘‘AGI’’), investment income, filing sta-tus, number of children, and immigration and work status in the United States. The maximum amount of the EIC applies over a certain income range and then diminishes to zero over a specified phaseout range. The EIC is a refundable credit, meaning that if the amount of the credit exceeds the taxpayer’s Federal income tax liability, the excess is payable to the taxpayer as a direct transfer payment. The EIC generally equals a specified per-centage of earned income up to a maximum dollar amount. Earned income is the sum of employee compensation includible in gross income (generally the amount reported in Box 1 of Form W–2, Wage and Tax State-ment, discussed below) plus net earnings from self-employment determined with re-gard to the deduction for one-half of self-em-ployment taxes.
95Special rules apply in com-puting earned income for purposes of the EIC.
96Net earnings from self-employment generally includes the gross income derived by an individual from any trade or business carried on by the individual, less the deduc-tions attributable to the trade or business that are allowed under the self-employment tax rules, plus the individual’s distributive share of income or loss from any trade or business of a partnership in which the indi-vidual is a partner.
97 Employment taxes and quarterly reporting by employers Employment taxes include employer and employee taxes on employee wages under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (‘‘FICA’’) and income taxes required to be withheld by employers from employee wages (‘‘income tax withholding’’).
98Income tax withholding rates vary depending on the amount of wages paid, the length of the pay-roll period, and the number of withholding allowances claimed by the employee. Em-ployers are required also to withhold the em-ployee share of FICA tax from employee wages. For these purposes, wages is defined

PRESENT LAW  Earned income credit Low- and moderate-income workers may be eligible for the refundable earned income credit (‘‘EIC’’). Eligibility for the EIC is based on earned income, adjusted gross in-come (‘‘AGI’’), investment income, filing sta-tus, number of children, and immigration and work status in the United States. The maximum amount of the EIC applies over a certain income range and then diminishes to zero over a specified phaseout range. The EIC is a refundable credit, meaning that if the amount of the credit exceeds the taxpayer’s Federal income tax liability, the excess is payable to the taxpayer as a direct transfer payment. The EIC generally equals a specified per-centage of earned income up to a maximum dollar amount. Earned income is the sum of employee compensation includible in gross income plus net earnings from self-employ-ment determined with regard to the deduc-tion for one-half of self-employment taxes.101 Special rules apply in computing earned in-come for purposes of the EIC.
102 Information reporting Present law imposes a variety of informa-tion reporting requirements on participants in certain transactions.
103These require-ments are intended to assist taxpayers in preparing their income tax returns and to help the Internal Revenue Service (‘‘IRS’’) determine whether such returns are correct and complete. The primary provision governing informa-tion reporting by payors requires an infor-mation return by every person engaged in a trade or business who makes payments ag-gregating $600 or more in any taxable year to a single payee in the course of the payor’s trade or business.
104Payments to corpora-tions generally are excepted from this re-quirement. Payments subject to reporting include fixed or determinable income or compensation, but do not include payments for goods or certain enumerated types of payments that are subject to other specific reporting requirements.
105Detailed rules are provided for the reporting of various types of investment income, including interest, divi-dends, and gross proceeds from brokered transactions (such as a sale of stock) paid to U.S. persons.
106 Special information reporting require-ments exist for employers required to deduct and withhold tax from employees’ income.
107 In addition, any service recipient engaged in a trade or business and paying for services is required to make a return according to regu-lations when the aggregate of payments is $600 or more.
108 There are also information reporting re-quirements for merchant acquiring entities and third party settlement organizations with respect to payments made in settle-ment of payment card transactions and third party payment network transactions occur-ring in that calendar year.
109 The payor of amounts described above is required to provide the recipient of the pay-ment with an annual statement showing the aggregate payments made and contact infor-mation for the payor.110The statement must be supplied to taxpayers by the payors by January 31 of the following calendar year.
7 Payors generally must file the information return with the IRS on or before January 31 of the year following the calendar year to which such returns relate.
111 Failure to comply with the information re-porting requirements results in penalties, which may include a penalty for failure to file the information return,
112to furnish payee statements,
113or to comply with other various reporting requirements.
114No pen- alty is imposed if the failure is due to rea-sonable cause.
115Any person who is required to file an information return, but who fails to do so on or before the prescribed filing date is subject to a penalty that varies based on when, if at all, the correct information re-turn is filed and the correct payee statement is furnished. Books or records Every person liable for any tax imposed by the Code, or for the collection thereof, must keep such records, render such statements, make such returns, and comply with such rules and regulations as the Secretary may from time to time prescribe.
116Whenever necessary, the Secretary may require any person, by notice served upon that person or by regulations, to make such returns, render such statements, or keep such records, as the Secretary deems sufficient to show whether or not that person is liable for tax. Persons subject to income tax are required to keep books or records sufficient to establish the amount of gross income, deductions, credits, or other matters required to be shown by that person in any return of such tax or in-formation.
117The books or records are re-quired to be kept available at all times for inspection by the IRS, and must be retained so long as the contents thereof may become material in the administration of any inter-nal revenue law.
118 
HOUSE BILL  The provision limits earned income for purposes of the earned income credit to amounts substantiated by the taxpayer on statements furnished or returns filed under third party information reporting require-ments, or amounts substantiated by the tax-payer’s books and records. The authority of the IRS to make returns, render statements, or keep records and, pursuant to the Code, to make corresponding adjustments to income to reflect substantiated amounts for pur-poses other than the EIC remains unaffected by this provision. Effective date.—The provision is effective for taxable years ending after the date of en-actment.

Limitation on losses for taxpayers other than corporations (sec. 11012 of the Sen-ate amendment and sec. 461(l) of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  Loss limitation rules applicable to individ-uals Passive loss rules The passive loss rules limit deductions and credits from passive trade or business activi-ties.
119The passive loss rules apply to indi-viduals, estates and trusts, and closely held corporations. A passive activity for this pur-pose is a trade or business activity in which the taxpayer owns an interest, but in which the taxpayer does not materially participate. A taxpayer is treated as materially partici-pating in an activity only if the taxpayer is involved in the operation of the activity on a basis that is regular, continuous, and sub-stantial.
120Deductions attributable to pas-sive activities, to the extent they exceed in-come from passive activities, generally may not be deducted against other income. De-ductions and credits that are suspended under these rules are carried forward and treated as deductions and credits from pas-sive activities in the next year. The sus-pended losses from a passive activity are al-lowed in full when a taxpayer makes a tax-able disposition of his entire interest in the passive activity to an unrelated person. Excess farm loss rules A limitation on excess farm losses applies to taxpayers other than C corporations.
121If a taxpayer other than a C corporation re-ceives an applicable subsidy for the taxable year, the amount of the excess farm loss is not allowed for the taxable year, and is car-ried forward and treated as a deduction at-tributable to farming businesses in the next taxable year. An excess farm loss for a tax-able year means the excess of aggregate de-ductions that are attributable to farming businesses over the sum of aggregate gross income or gain attributable to farming busi-nesses plus the threshold amount. The threshold amount is the greater of (1) $300,000 ($150,000 for married individuals fil-ing separately), or (2) for the five-consecu-tive-year period preceding the taxable year, the excess of the aggregate gross income or gain attributable to the taxpayer’s farming businesses over the aggregate deductions at-tributable to the taxpayer’s farming busi-nesses. 
HOUSE BILL  No provision. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  For taxable years beginning after Decem-ber 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026, excess business losses of a taxpayer other than a corporation are not allowed for the taxable year. Such losses are carried forward and treated as part of the taxpayer’s net oper-ating loss (‘‘NOL’’) carryforward in subse-quent taxable years. Under the bill, NOL carryovers generally are allowed for a tax-able year up to the lesser of the carryover amount or 90 percent (80 percent for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2022) of taxable income determined without regard to the deduction for NOLs. An excess business loss for the taxable year is the excess of aggregate deductions of the taxpayer attributable to trades or busi-nesses of the taxpayer (determined without regard to the limitation of the provision), over the sum of aggregate gross income or gain of the taxpayer plus a threshold amount. The threshold amount for a taxable year is $250,000 (or twice the otherwise appli-cable threshold amount in the case of a joint return). The threshold amount is indexed for inflation. In the case of a partnership or S corpora-tion, the provision applies at the partner or shareholder level. Each partner’s distribu-tive share and each S corporation share-holder’s pro rata share of items of income, gain, deduction, or loss of the partnership or S corporation are taken into account in ap-plying the limitation under the provision for the taxable year of the partner or S corpora-tion shareholder. Regulatory authority is provided to apply the provision to any other passthrough entity to the extent necessary to carry out the provision. Regulatory au-thority is also provided to require any addi-tional reporting as the Secretary determines is appropriate to carry out the purposes of the provision. The provision applies after the application of the passive loss rules.122 For taxable years beginning after Decem-ber 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026, the present-law limitation relating to excess farm losses does not apply. Effective date.—The provision is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the Sen-ate amendment. Thus, excess business losses not allowed are carried forward and treated as part of the taxpayer’s net operating loss (‘‘NOL’’) carryforward in subsequent taxable years as determined under the NOL rules provided under the conference agreement. Effective date.—The provision is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 9. Reform of American opportunity tax credit and repeal of lifetime learning credit (sec. 1201 of the House bill and sec. 25A of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  American Opportunity credit The American Opportunity credit provides individuals with a tax credit of up to $2,500 per eligible student per year for qualified tuition and related expenses (including course materials) paid for each of the first four years of the student’s post-secondary education in a degree or certificate program. The credit rate is 100 percent on the first $2,000 of qualified tuition and related ex-penses, and 25 percent on the next $2,000 of qualified tuition and related expenses. The credit may not be claimed for more than four taxable years with respect to any student. The American Opportunity credit is phased out ratably for taxpayers with modified AGI between $80,000 and $90,000 ($160,000 and $180,000 for married taxpayers filing a joint return). The credit may be claimed against a taxpayer’s AMT liability. Forty percent of a taxpayer’s otherwise al-lowable modified credit is refundable. A re-fundable credit is a credit which, if the amount of the credit exceeds the taxpayer’s Federal income tax liability, the excess is payable to the taxpayer as a direct transfer payment. A taxpayer may not claim the American Opportunity credit if the qualified tuition and related expenses for the enrollment or attendance of a student, if such student has been convicted of a Federal or State felony offense consisting of the possession or dis-tribution of a controlled substance before the end of the taxable year.
123 Lifetime learning credit Individual taxpayers may be eligible to claim a nonrefundable credit, the Lifetime Learning credit, against Federal income taxes equal to 20 percent of qualified tuition and related expenses incurred during the tax-able year on behalf of the taxpayer, the tax-payer’s spouse, or any dependents. Up to $10,000 of qualified tuition and related ex-penses per taxpayer return are eligible for the Lifetime Learning credit (i.e., the max- imum credit per taxpayer return is $2,000). In contrast to the American Opportunity credit, a taxpayer may claim the Lifetime Learning credit for an unlimited number of taxable years.124Also in contrast to the American Opportunity credit, the maximum amount of the Lifetime Learning credit that may be claimed on a taxpayer’s return does not vary based on the number of students in the taxpayer’s family—that is, the American Opportunity credit is computed on a per-stu-dent basis while the Lifetime Learning cred-it is computed on a family-wide basis. The Lifetime Learning credit amount that a tax-payer may otherwise claim is phased out rat-ably for taxpayers with modified AGI be-tween $56,000 and $66,000 ($112,000 and $132,000 for married taxpayers filing a joint return) in 2017. 
HOUSE BILL  The House bill modifies the American Op-portunity credit
125by providing that a credit may be claimed with respect to a student for five taxable years (rather than four taxable years under present law). For a credit claimed with respect to the student’s fifth taxable year, the credit is half the value of the American Opportunity credit that is ap-plicable to the first four taxable years (the refundable portion of the credit is 40-percent of the half-value credit). Additionally, the provision allows a student to claim the American Opportunity credit for any of the first five years of postsecondary education. The operation of this provision is as fol-lows. Assume that a student enters college in the Fall of 2018, attending for eight con-secutive semesters, such that the student graduates in the Spring of 2022. Assume that qualifying tuition and fees for each semester is in excess of $5,000. For each of taxable years 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021, an individual claiming the credit on behalf of the student would be eligible for the maximum credit of $2,500 (of which $1,000 is refundable). For tax-able year 2022, a taxpayer claiming the credit on behalf of the student may be eligible for a $1,250 credit (of which $500 is refundable). Alternatively, if no credit were claimed with respect to the student in 2022, and the stu-dent were to decide to attend graduate school in the Fall of 2024, the student may claim the half-value fifth year credit ($1,250 ($500 refundable)) for the 2024 taxable year. The provision repeals the lifetime learning credit. Effective date.—The provision is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  No provision. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement does not include the House bill provision.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H10005 December 15, 2017 
126Sec. 530. 
127In addition, Coverdell education savings ac-counts are subject to the unrelated business income tax imposed by section 511. 
128This 10-percent additional tax does not apply if a distribution from an education savings account is made on account of the death or disability of the designated beneficiary, or if made on account of a scholarship received by the designated beneficiary. 129Qualified higher education expenses are defined in the same manner as for qualified tuition pro-grams. 
130Sec. 530(b)(2)(B). 
131For purposes of this description, the term ‘‘ac-count’’ is used interchangeably to refer to a prepaid tuition benefit contract or a tuition savings account established pursuant to a qualified tuition program. 
132Section 529 refers to contributors and des-ignated beneficiaries, but does not define or other-wise refer to the term ‘‘account owner,’’ which is a commonly used term among qualified tuition pro-grams. 10. Consolidation and modification of edu-cation savings rules (sec. 1202 of the House bill, sec. 11033 of the Senate amendment, and secs. 529 and 530 of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  Coverdell education savings accounts A Coverdell education savings account is a trust or custodial account created exclu-sively for the purpose of paying qualified education expenses of a named beneficiary.
126 Annual contributions to Coverdell education savings accounts may not exceed $2,000 per designated beneficiary and may not be made after the designated beneficiary reaches age 18 (except in the case of a special needs bene-ficiary). The contribution limit is phased out for taxpayers with modified AGI between $95,000 and $110,000 ($190,000 and $220,000 for married taxpayers filing a joint return); the AGI of the contributor, and not that of the beneficiary, controls whether a contribution is permitted by the taxpayer. Earnings on contributions to a Coverdell education savings account generally are sub-ject to tax when withdrawn.
127However, dis-tributions from a Coverdell education sav-ings account are excludable from the gross income of the distributee (i.e., the student) to the extent that the distribution does not exceed the qualified education expenses in-curred by the beneficiary during the year the distribution is made. The earnings portion of a Coverdell education savings account dis-tribution not used to pay qualified education expenses is includible in the gross income of the distributee and generally is subject to an additional 10-percent tax.
128 Tax-free (and free of additional 10-percent tax) transfers or rollovers of account bal-ances from one Coverdell education savings account benefiting one beneficiary to an-other Coverdell education savings account benefiting another beneficiary (as well as re-designations of the named beneficiary) are permitted, provided that the new beneficiary is a member of the family of the prior bene-ficiary and is under age 30 (except in the case of a special needs beneficiary). In general, any balance remaining in a Coverdell edu-cation savings account is deemed to be dis-tributed within 30 days after the date that the beneficiary reaches age 30 (or, if the ben-eficiary dies before attaining age 30, within 30 days of the date that the beneficiary dies). Qualified education expenses include quali-fied elementary and secondary expenses and qualified higher education expenses. Such qualified education expenses generally in-clude only out-of-pocket expenses. They do not include expenses covered by employer- provided educational assistance or scholar-ships for the benefit of the beneficiary that are excludable from gross income. The term qualified elementary and sec-ondary school expenses, means expenses for: (1) tuition, fees, academic tutoring, special needs services, books, supplies, and other equipment incurred in connection with the enrollment or attendance of the beneficiary at a public, private, or religious school pro-viding elementary or secondary education (kindergarten through grade 12) as deter-mined under State law; (2) room and board, uniforms, transportation, and supplementary items or services (including extended day programs) required or provided by such a school in connection with such enrollment or attendance of the beneficiary; and (3) the purchase of any computer technology or equipment (as defined in section 170(e)(6)(F)(i)) or internet access and related services, if such technology, equipment, or services are to be used by the beneficiary and the beneficiary’s family during any of the years the beneficiary is in elementary or sec-ondary school. Computer software primarily involving sports, games, or hobbies is not considered a qualified elementary and sec-ondary school expense unless the software is predominantly educational in nature. The term qualified higher education ex-penses includes tuition, fees, books, supplies, and equipment required for the enrollment or attendance of the designated beneficiary at an eligible education institution, regard-less of whether the beneficiary is enrolled at an eligible educational institution on a full- time, half-time, or less than half-time basis.129Moreover, qualified higher edu-cation expenses include certain room and board expenses for any period during which the beneficiary is at least a half-time stu-dent. Qualified higher education expenses in-clude expenses with respect to under-graduate or graduate-level courses. In addi-tion, qualified higher education expenses in-clude amounts paid or incurred to purchase tuition credits (or to make contributions to an account) under a qualified tuition pro-gram for the benefit of the beneficiary of the Coverdell education savings account.
130 Section 529 qualified tuition programs In general A qualified tuition program is a program established and maintained by a State or agency or instrumentality thereof, or by one or more eligible educational institutions, which satisfies certain requirements and under which a person may purchase tuition credits or certificates on behalf of a des-ignated beneficiary that entitle the bene-ficiary to the waiver or payment of qualified higher education expenses of the beneficiary (a ‘‘prepaid tuition program’’). Section 529 provides specified income tax and transfer tax rules for the treatment of accounts and contracts established under qualified tuition programs.
131In the case of a program estab-lished and maintained by a State or agency or instrumentality thereof, a qualified tui-tion program also includes a program under which a person may make contributions to an account that is established for the pur-pose of satisfying the qualified higher edu-cation expenses of the designated beneficiary of the account, provided it satisfies certain specified requirements (a ‘‘savings account program’’). Under both types of qualified tui-tion programs, a contributor establishes an account for the benefit of a particular des-ignated beneficiary to provide for that bene-ficiary’s higher education expenses. In general, prepaid tuition contracts and tuition savings accounts established under a qualified tuition program involve prepay-ments or contributions made by one or more individuals for the benefit of a designated beneficiary. Decisions with respect to the contract or account are typically made by an individual who is not the designated bene-ficiary. Qualified tuition accounts or con-tracts generally require the designation of a person (generally referred to as an ‘‘account owner’’)
132whom the program administrator (oftentimes a third party administrator re-tained by the State or by the educational in-stitution that established the program) may look to for decisions, recordkeeping, and re-porting with respect to the account estab-lished for a designated beneficiary. The per-son or persons who make the contributions to the account need not be the same person who is regarded as the account owner for purposes of administering the account. Under many qualified tuition programs, the account owner generally has control over the account or contract, including the ability to change designated beneficiaries and to with-draw funds at any time and for any purpose. Thus, in practice, qualified tuition accounts or contracts generally involve a contributor, a designated beneficiary, an account owner (who oftentimes is not the contributor or the designated beneficiary), and an adminis-trator of the account or contract. Qualified higher education expenses For purposes of receiving a distribution from a qualified tuition program that quali-fies for favorable tax treatment under the Code, qualified higher education expenses means tuition, fees, books, supplies, and equipment required for the enrollment or at-tendance of a designated beneficiary at an eligible educational institution, and ex-penses for special needs services in the case of a special needs beneficiary that are in-curred in connection with such enrollment or attendance. Qualified higher education ex-penses generally also include room and board for students who are enrolled at least half- time. Qualified higher education expenses in-clude the purchase of any computer tech-nology or equipment, or Internet access or related services, if such technology or serv-ices were to be used primarily by the bene-ficiary during any of the years a beneficiary is enrolled at an eligible institution. Contributions to qualified tuition programs Contributions to a qualified tuition pro-gram must be made in cash. Section 529 does not impose a specific dollar limit on the amount of contributions, account balances, or prepaid tuition benefits relating to a qualified tuition account; however, the pro-gram is required to have adequate safeguards to prevent contributions in excess of amounts necessary to provide for the bene-ficiary’s qualified higher education expenses. Contributions generally are treated as a completed gift eligible for the gift tax an-nual exclusion. Contributions are not tax de-ductible for Federal income tax purposes, al-though they may be deductible for State in-come tax purposes. Amounts in the account accumulate on a tax-free basis ( i.e., income on accounts in the plan is not subject to cur-rent income tax). A qualified tuition program may not per-mit any contributor to, or designated bene-ficiary under, the program to direct (directly or indirectly) the investment of any con-tributions (or earnings thereon) more than two times in any calendar year, and must provide separate accounting for each des-ignated beneficiary. A qualified tuition pro-gram may not allow any interest in an ac-count or contract (or any portion thereof) to be used as security for a loan. HOUSE BILL  Under the House bill, no new contributions are permitted into Coverdell savings ac-counts after December 31, 2017. However, rollovers of account balances from one Coverdell education savings account to an-other pre-existing Coverdell education sav-ings account benefiting another beneficiary

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH10006 December 15, 2017 
133Sec. 108(f). 
13415 U.S.C. 1650(7). 135Although the provision makes specific reference to those provisions of the Higher Education Act of 1965 that discharge William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program loans, Federal Family Education Loan Program loans, and Federal Perkins Loan Pro-gram loans in the case of death and total and perma-nent disability, the provision also contains a catch- all exclusion in the case of a student loan discharged on account of the death or total and permanent dis-ability of the student, in addition to those specific statutory references. 
136Section 108 of the Indian Health Care Improve-ment Act established the Indian Health Service loan repayment program to assure a sufficient supply of trained health professionals needed to provide health care services to Indians. Pub. L. No. 94–437, as amended by Pub. L. No. 100–713, sec. 108, and Pub. L. No. 102–573, sec. 106, and as amended, and perma-nently reauthorized by Pub. L. No. 111–148, sec. 10221. 
137Sec. 221. 
138Sec. 221(c). remain permitted after this date. Addition-ally, the provision allows section 529 plans to receive rollover contributions from Coverdell education savings accounts. The provision modifies section 529 plans to allow such plans to distribute not more than $10,000 in expenses for tuition incurred dur-ing the taxable year in connection with the enrollment or attendance of the designated beneficiary at a public, private or religious elementary or secondary school. This limita-tion applies on a per-student basis, rather than a per-account basis. Thus, under the provision, although an individual may be the designated beneficiary of multiple accounts, that individual may receive a maximum of $10,000 in distributions free of tax, regardless of whether the funds are distributed from multiple accounts. Any excess distributions received by the individual would be treated as a distribution subject to tax under the general rules of section 529. The provision also modifies section 529 plans to allow such plan distributions to be used for certain expenses, including books, supplies, and equipment, required for attend-ance in a registered apprenticeship program. Registered apprenticeship programs are ap-prenticeship programs registered and cer-tified with the Secretary of Labor. Finally, the provision specifies that noth-ing in this section shall prevent an unborn child from qualifying as a designated bene-ficiary. For these purposes, an unborn child means a child in utero, and the term child in utero means a member of the species homo sapiens, at any stage of development, who is carried in the womb. Effective date.—The provision applies to contributions and distributions made after December 31, 2017. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The Senate amendment modifies section 529 plans to allow such plans to distribute not more than $10,000 in expenses for tuition incurred during the taxable year in connec-tion with the enrollment or attendance of the designated beneficiary at a public, pri-vate or religious elementary or secondary school. This limitation applies on a per-stu-dent basis, rather than a per-account basis. Thus, under the provision, although an indi-vidual may be the designated beneficiary of multiple accounts, that individual may re-ceive a maximum of $10,000 in distributions free of tax, regardless of whether the funds are distributed from multiple accounts. Any excess distributions received by the indi-vidual would be treated as a distribution subject to tax under the general rules of sec-tion 529. The provision also modifies the definition of higher education expenses to include cer-tain expenses incurred in connection with a homeschool. Those expenses are (1) cur-riculum and curricular materials; (2) books or other instructional materials; (3) online educational materials; (4) tuition for tutor-ing or educational classes outside of the home (but only if the tutor or instructor is not related to the student); (5) dual enroll-ment in an institution of higher education; and (6) educational therapies for students with disabilities. Effective date.—The provision applies to distributions made after December 31, 2017. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the Sen-ate amendment. 11. Reforms to discharge of certain student loan indebtedness (sec. 1203 of the House bill, sec. 11031 of the Senate amendment, and sec. 108 of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  Gross income generally includes the dis-charge of indebtedness of the taxpayer. Under an exception to this general rule, gross income does not include any amount from the forgiveness (in whole or in part) of certain student loans, provided that the for-giveness is contingent on the student’s work-ing for a certain period of time in certain professions for any of a broad class of em-ployers.133 Student loans eligible for this special rule must be made to an individual to assist the individual in attending an educational insti-tution that normally maintains a regular faculty and curriculum and normally has a regularly enrolled body of students in at-tendance at the place where its education ac-tivities are regularly carried on. Loan pro-ceeds may be used not only for tuition and required fees, but also to cover room and board expenses. The loan must be made by (1) the United States (or an instrumentality or agency thereof), (2) a State (or any polit-ical subdivision thereof), (3) certain tax-ex-empt public benefit corporations that con-trol a State, county, or municipal hospital and whose employees have been deemed to be public employees under State law, or (4) an educational organization that originally re-ceived the funds from which the loan was made from the United States, a State, or a tax-exempt public benefit corporation. In addition, an individual’s gross income does not include amounts from the forgive-ness of loans made by educational organiza-tions (and certain tax-exempt organizations in the case of refinancing loans) out of pri-vate, nongovernmental funds if the proceeds of such loans are used to pay costs of attend-ance at an educational institution or to refi-nance any outstanding student loans (not just loans made by educational organiza-tions) and the student is not employed by the lender organization. In the case of such loans made or refinanced by educational or-ganizations (or refinancing loans made by certain tax-exempt organizations), cancella-tion of the student loan must be contingent on the student working in an occupation or area with unmet needs and such work must be performed for, or under the direction of, a tax-exempt charitable organization or a gov-ernmental entity. Finally, an individual’s gross income does not include any loan repayment amount re-ceived under the National Health Service Corps loan repayment program, certain State loan repayment programs, or any amount received by an individual under any State loan repayment or loan forgiveness program that is intended to provide for the increased availability of health care services in underserved or health professional short-age areas (as determined by the State). 
HOUSE BILL  The House bill modifies the exclusion of student loan discharges from gross income, by including within the exclusion certain discharges on account of death or disability. Loans eligible for the exclusion under the provision are loans made by (1) the United States (or an instrumentality or agency thereof), (2) a State (or any political subdivi-sion thereof), (3) certain tax-exempt public benefit corporations that control a State, county, or municipal hospital and whose em-ployees have been deemed to be public em-ployees under State law, (4) an educational organization that originally received the funds from which the loan was made from the United States, a State, or a tax-exempt public benefit corporation, or (5) private edu-cation loans (for this purpose, private edu-cation loan is defined in section 140(7) of the Consumer Protection Act).
134 Under the provision, the discharge of a loan as described above is excluded from gross income if the discharge was pursuant to the death or total and permanent dis-ability of the student.135 Additionally, the provision modifies the gross income exclusion for amounts received under the National Health Service Corps loan repayment program or certain State loan repayment programs to include any amount received by an individual under the Indian Health Service loan repayment pro-gram.
136 Effective date.—The provision applies to discharges of loans after, and amounts re-ceived after, December 31, 2017. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The Senate amendment generally follows the House bill. However, the Senate amend-ment does not contain the provision in the House bill excluding amounts received under the Indian Health Service loan repayment program from income. Additionally, the Senate amendment does not apply to discharges of indebtedness oc-curring after December 31, 2025. Effective date.—The provision is effective for discharges of indebtedness after Decem-ber 31, 2017. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the Sen-ate amendment. 12. Repeal of deduction for student loan in-terest (sec. 1204 of the House bill and sec. 221 of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  Certain individuals who have paid interest on qualified education loans may claim an above-the-line deduction for such interest expenses, subject to a maximum annual de-duction limit.
137Required payments of inter-est generally do not include voluntary pay-ments, such as interest payments made dur-ing a period of loan forbearance. No deduc-tion is allowed to an individual if that indi-vidual is claimed as a dependent on another taxpayer’s return for the taxable year.
138 A qualified education loan generally is de-fined as any indebtedness incurred solely to pay for the costs of attendance (including room and board) of the taxpayer, the tax-payer’s spouse, or any dependent of the tax-payer as of the time the indebtedness was in-curred in attending on at least a half-time basis (1) eligible educational institutions, or (2) institutions conducting internship or residency programs leading to a degree or certificate from an institution of higher edu-cation, a hospital, or a health care facility conducting postgraduate training. The cost of attendance is reduced by any amount ex-cluded from gross income under the exclu-sions for qualified scholarships and tuition reductions, employer-provided educational assistance, interest earned on education sav-ings bonds, qualified tuition programs, and Coverdell education savings accounts, as well as the amount of certain other scholar-ships and similar payments.

139Sec. 221(b)(1). 
140Sec. 222(a). 
141Sec. 222(b)(2)(B). 
142Individuals described under the rules of Sec. 132(h). 143Educational organization described in section 170(b)(1)(A)(ii). Sec. 117(d)(2). 
144The exclusion applies with respect to highly compensated employees, within the meaning of Sec. 414(q), only if such tuition reductions are available on substantially the same terms to each member of a group of employees which is defined under a rea-sonable classification established by the employer, such that the benefit does not discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees. 
145Sec. 135. 146Sec. 127(a). 
147The employer’s educational assistance program must not discriminate in favor of highly com-pensated employees, within the meaning of Sec. 414(q). In addition, no more than five percent of the amounts paid or incurred by the employer during the year for educational assistance under a qualified educational assistance program can be provided for the class of individuals consisting of more-than-five- percent owners of the employer and the spouses or dependents of such more-than-five-percent owners. 
148Sec. 529A. The maximum allowable deduction per year is $2,500.
139For 2017, the deduction is phased out ratably for taxpayers with AGI between $65,000 and $80,000 ($135,000 and $165,000 for married taxpayers filing a joint return). The income phase-out ranges are in-dexed for inflation and rounded to the next lowest multiple of $5,000. 
HOUSE BILL  The provision repeals the deduction for student loan interest. Effective date.—The provision is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  No provision. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement does not include the House bill provision. 13. Repeal of deduction for qualified tuition and related expenses (sec. 1204 of the House bill and sec. 222 of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  For taxable years beginning before Janu-ary 1, 2017, an individual is allowed an above- the-line deduction for qualified tuition and related expenses for higher education paid by the individual during the taxable year.
140 Qualified tuition includes tuition and fees required for the enrollment or attendance by the taxpayer, the taxpayer’s spouse, or any dependent of the taxpayer with respect to whom the taxpayer may claim a personal ex-emption, at an eligible institution of higher education for courses of instruction of such individual at such institution. The expenses must be in connection with enrollment at an institution of higher education during the taxable year, or with an academic term be-ginning during the taxable year or during the first three months of the next taxable year. The deduction is not available for tui-tion and related expenses paid for elemen-tary or secondary education. The maximum deduction is $4,000 for an in-dividual whose AGI for the taxable year does not exceed $65,000 ($130,000 in the case of a joint return), or $2,000 for other individuals whose AGI does not exceed $80,000 ($160,000 in the case of a joint return).
141No deduction is allowed for an individual whose AGI exceeds the relevant AGI limitations, for a married individual who does not file a joint return, or for an individual with respect to whom a per-sonal exemption deduction may be claimed by another taxpayer for the taxable year. The deduction is not available for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2016. 
HOUSE BILL  The provision repeals the deduction for qualified tuition and related expenses. Effective date.—The provision is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  No provision. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement does not include the House bill provision. 14. Repeal of exclusion for qualified tuition reductions (sec. 1204 of the House bill and sec. 117(d) of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  Qualified tuition reductions for certain education provided to employees (and their spouses and dependents
142) of certain edu-cational organizations are excludible from gross income.143The tuition reduction is sub-ject to nondiscrimination rules.
144The exclu- sion generally applies below the graduate level, and to teaching and research assist-ants who are students at the graduate level, but does not apply to any amount received by a student that represents payment for teaching, research or other services by the student required as a condition for receiving the tuition reduction. Amounts that are ex-cludible from gross income for income tax purposes are also excluded from wages for employment tax purposes. 
HOUSE BILL  The provision repeals the exclusions from gross income and wages for qualified tuition reductions. Effective date.—The provision applies to amounts paid or incurred after December 31, 2017. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  No provision. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement does not include the House bill provision. 15. Repeal of exclusion for interest on United States savings bonds used for higher edu-cation expenses (sec. 1204 of the House bill and sec. 135 of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  Interest earned on a qualified United States Series EE savings bond issued after 1989 is excludable from gross income if the proceeds of the bond upon redemption do not exceed qualified higher education expenses paid by the taxpayer during the taxable year.
145Qualified higher education expenses include tuition and fees (but not room and board expenses) required for the enrollment or attendance of the taxpayer, the taxpayer’s spouse, or a dependent of the taxpayer at certain eligible higher educational institu-tions. The amount of qualified higher edu-cation expenses taken into account for pur-poses of the exclusion is reduced by the amount of such expenses taken into account in determining the Hope, American Oppor-tunity, or Lifetime Learning credits claimed by any taxpayer, or taken into account in determining an exclusion from gross income for a distribution from a qualified tuition program or a Coverdell education savings ac-count, with respect to a particular student for the taxable year. The exclusion is phased out for certain higher-income taxpayers, determined by the taxpayer’s modified AGI during the year the bond is redeemed. For 2017, the exclusion is phased out for taxpayers with modified AGI between $78,150 and $93,150 ($117,250 and $147,250 for married taxpayers filing a joint return). To prevent taxpayers from effec-tively avoiding the income phaseout limita-tion through the purchase of bonds directly in the child’s name, the interest exclusion is available only with respect to U.S. Series EE savings bonds issued to taxpayers who are at least 24 years old. 
HOUSE BILL  The House bill repeals exclusion for inter-est on Series EE savings bond used for quali-fied higher education expenses. Effective date.—The provision generally ap-plies to taxable years beginning after De-cember 31, 2017. SENATE AMENDMENT  No provision. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement does not include the House bill provision. 16. Repeal of exclusion for educational assist-ance programs (sec. 1204 of the House bill and sec. 127 of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  Up to $5,250 annually of educational assist-ance provided by an employer to an em-ployee is excludible from the employee’s gross income, provided that certain require-ments are satisfied.
146Nondiscrimination rules
147apply and the educational assistance must be provided pursuant to a separate written plan of the employer. The exclusion applies to both graduate and undergraduate courses, and applies only with respect to education provided to the employee ( i.e., it does not apply to education provided to the spouse or a child of the employee). Amounts that are excludible from gross income for in-come tax purposes are also excluded from wages for employment tax purposes. For purposes of the exclusion, educational assistance means the payment by an em-ployer of expenses incurred by or on behalf of the employee for education of the employee including, but not limited to, tuition, fees and similar payments, books, supplies, and equipment. Educational assistance also in-cludes the provision by the employer of courses of instruction for the employee (in-cluding books, supplies, and equipment). Educational assistance does not include (1) tools or supplies that may be retained by the employee after completion of a course, (2) meals, lodging, or transportation, and (3) any education involving sports, games, or hobbies. 
HOUSE BILL  The provision repeals the exclusions from gross income and wages for educational as-sistance programs. Effective date.—The provision applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  No provision. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement does not include the House bill provision. 17. Rollovers between qualified tuition pro-grams and qualified ABLE programs (sec. 1205 of the House bill, sec. 11025 of the Senate amendment and secs. 529 and 529A of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  Qualified ABLE programs The Code provides for a tax-favored savings program intended to benefit disabled individ-uals, known as qualified ABLE programs.
148 A qualified ABLE program is a program es-tablished and maintained by a State or agen-cy or instrumentality thereof. A qualified ABLE program must meet the following con-ditions: (1) under the provisions of the pro-gram, contributions may be made to an ac-count (an ‘‘ABLE account’’), established for the purpose of meeting the qualified dis-ability expenses of the designated bene-ficiary of the account; (2) the program must

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH10008 December 15, 2017 
149This amount is indexed for inflation. In the case that contributions to an ABLE account exceed the annual limit, an excise tax in the amount of six per-cent of the excess contribution to such account is imposed on the designated beneficiary. Such tax does not apply in the event that the trustee of such account makes a corrective distribution of such ex-cess amounts by the due date (including extensions) of the individual’s tax return for the year within the taxable year. 
150The rules of section 72 apply in determining the portion of a distribution that consists of earnings. 
151For instance, if a designated beneficiary were to relocate to a different State. 
152In which case the contributor ABLE account must be closed 60 days after the transfer to the new ABLE account is made. 153These are benefits, respectively, under Title II or Title XVI of the Social Security Act. 
154No inference may be drawn from a disability certification for purposes of eligibility for Social Se-curity, SSI or Medicaid benefits. 155For these purposes, a member of the family means, with respect to any designated beneficiary, the taxpayer’s: (1) spouse; (2) child or descendant of a child; (3) brother, sister, stepbrother or stepsister; (4) father, mother or ancestor of either; (5) step-father or stepmother; (6) niece or nephew; (7) aunt or uncle; (8) in-law; (9) the spouse of any individual de-scribed in (2)–(8); and (10) any first cousin of the des-ignated beneficiary. 
156529A(b)(2)(B). 
157529(c)(3)(A). 
158Sec. 68. limit a designated beneficiary to one ABLE account; and (3) the program must meet cer-tain other requirements discussed below. A qualified ABLE program is generally exempt from income tax, but is otherwise subject to the taxes imposed on the unrelated business income of tax-exempt organizations. A designated beneficiary of an ABLE ac-count is the owner of the ABLE account. A designated beneficiary must be an eligible individual (defined below) who established the ABLE account and who is designated at the commencement of participation in the qualified ABLE program as the beneficiary of amounts paid (or to be paid) into and from the program. Contributions to an ABLE account must be made in cash and are not deductible for Fed-eral income tax purposes. Except in the case of a rollover contribution from another ABLE account, an ABLE account must pro-vide that it may not receive aggregate con-tributions during a taxable year in excess of the amount under section 2503(b) of the Code (the annual gift tax exemption). For 2017, this is $14,000.
149Additionally, a qualified ABLE program must provide adequate safe-guards to ensure that ABLE account con-tributions do not exceed the limit imposed on accounts under the qualified tuition pro-gram of the State maintaining the qualified ABLE program. Amounts in the account ac-cumulate on a tax-deferred basis (i.e., in-come on accounts under the program is not subject to current income tax). A qualified ABLE program may permit a designated beneficiary to direct (directly or indirectly) the investment of any contribu-tions (or earnings thereon) no more than two times in any calendar year and must provide separate accounting for each designated ben-eficiary. A qualified ABLE program may not allow any interest in the program (or any portion thereof) to be used as security for a loan. Distributions from an ABLE account are generally includible in the distributee’s in-come to the extent consisting of earnings on the account.
150Distributions from an ABLE account are excludable from income to the extent that the total distribution does not exceed the qualified disability expenses of the designated beneficiary during the tax-able year. If a distribution from an ABLE ac-count exceeds the qualified disability ex-penses of the designated beneficiary, a pro rata portion of the distribution is excludable from income. The portion of any distribution that is includible in income is subject to an additional 10-percent tax unless the distribu-tion is made after the death of the bene-ficiary. Amounts in an ABLE account may be rolled over without income tax liability to another ABLE account for the same bene-ficiary
151or another ABLE account for the designated beneficiary’s brother, sister, step-brother or stepsister who is also an eligible individual. Except in the case of an ABLE account es-tablished in a different ABLE program for purposes of transferring ABLE accounts,
152 no more than one ABLE account may be es-tablished by a designated beneficiary. Thus, once an ABLE account has been established by a designated beneficiary, no account sub-sequently established by such beneficiary shall be treated as an ABLE account. A contribution to an ABLE account is treated as a completed gift of a present in-terest to the designated beneficiary of the account. Such contributions qualify for the per-donee annual gift tax exclusion ($14,000 for 2017) and, to the extent of such exclusion, are exempt from the generation skipping transfer (‘‘GST’’) tax. A distribution from an ABLE account generally is not subject to gift tax or GST tax. Eligible individuals As described above, a qualified ABLE pro-gram may provide for the establishment of ABLE accounts only if those accounts are es-tablished and owned by an eligible indi-vidual, such owner referred to as a des-ignated beneficiary. For these purposes, an eligible individual is an individual either (1) for whom a disability certification has been filed with the Secretary for the taxable year, or (2) who is entitled to Social Security Dis-ability Insurance benefits or SSI benefits153 based on blindness or disability, and such blindness or disability occurred before the individual attained age 26. A disability certification means a certifi-cation to the satisfaction of the Secretary, made by the eligible individual or the parent or guardian of the eligible individual, that the individual has a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, which re-sults in marked and severe functional limi-tations, and which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be ex-pected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months, or is blind (within the meaning of section 1614(a)(2) of the Social Security Act). Such blindness or disability must have occurred before the date the indi-vidual attained age 26. Such certification must include a copy of the diagnosis of the individual’s impairment and be signed by a licensed physician.
154 Qualified disability expenses As described above, the earnings on dis-tributions from an ABLE account are ex-cluded from income only to the extent total distributions do not exceed the qualified dis-ability expenses of the designated bene-ficiary. For this purpose, qualified disability expenses are any expenses related to the eli-gible individual’s blindness or disability which are made for the benefit of the des-ignated beneficiary. Such expenses include the following expenses: education, housing, transportation, employment training and support, assistive technology and personal support services, health, prevention and wellness, financial management and admin-istrative services, legal fees, expenses for oversight and monitoring, funeral and burial expenses, and other expenses, which are ap-proved by the Secretary under regulations and consistent with the purposes of section 529A. Transfer to State In the event that the designated bene-ficiary dies, subject to any outstanding pay-ments due for qualified disability expenses incurred by the designated beneficiary, all amounts remaining in the deceased des-ignated beneficiary’s ABLE account not in excess of the amount equal to the total med-ical assistance paid such individual under any State Medicaid plan established under title XIX of the Social Security Act shall be distributed to such State upon filing of a claim for payment by such State. Such re-paid amounts shall be net of any premiums paid from the account or by or on behalf of the beneficiary to the State’s Medicaid Buy- In program. Treatment of ABLE accounts under Federal programs Any amounts in an ABLE account, and any distribution for qualified disability expenses, shall be disregarded for purposes of deter-mining eligibility to receive, or the amount of, any assistance or benefit authorized by any Federal means-tested program. However, in the case of the SSI program, a distribu-tion for housing expenses is not disregarded, nor are amounts in an ABLE account in ex-cess of $100,000. In the case that an individ-ual’s ABLE account balance exceeds $100,000, such individual’s SSI benefits shall not be terminated, but instead shall be suspended until such time as the individual’s resources fall below $100,000. However, such suspension shall not apply for purposes of Medicaid eli-gibility. HOUSE BILL  The House bill allows for amounts from qualified tuition programs (also known as 529 accounts) to be rolled over to an ABLE ac-count without penalty, provided that the ABLE account is owned by the designated beneficiary of that 529 account, or a member of such designated beneficiary’s family.
155 Such rolled-over amounts count towards the overall limitation on amounts that can be contributed to an ABLE account within a taxable year.
156Any amount rolled over that is in excess of this limitation shall be includ-ible in the gross income of the distributee in a manner provided by section 72.
157 Effective date.—The provision applies to distributions after December 31, 2017. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The Senate amendment generally follows the House Bill. Under the Senate amend-ment, the provision is not effective for dis-tributions after December 31, 2025. Effective date.—The provision applies to distributions after the date of enactment. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the Sen-ate amendment. 18. Repeal of overall limitation on itemized deductions (sec. 1301 of the House bill, sec. 11046 of the Senate amendment, and sec. 68 of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  The total amount of most otherwise allow-able itemized deductions (other than the de-ductions for medical expenses, investment interest and casualty, theft or gambling losses) is limited for certain upper-income taxpayers.
158All other limitations applicable to such deductions (such as the separate floors) are first applied and, then, the other-wise allowable total amount of itemized de-ductions is reduced by three percent of the amount by which the taxpayer’s adjusted gross income exceeds a threshold amount. For 2017, the threshold amounts are $261,500 for single taxpayers, $287,650 for heads of household, $313,800 for married cou-ples filing jointly, and $156,900 for married

Specifically, the $1,000,000 ($500,000 in the case of married taxpayers filing sepa-rately) limitation continues to apply to any indebt-edness incurred on or after November 2, 2017, to refi-nance qualified residence indebtedness incurred be-fore that date to the extent the amount of the in-debtedness resulting from the refinancing does not exceed the amount of the refinanced indebtedness. Thus, the maximum dollar amount that may be treated as principal residence acquisition indebted-ness will not decrease by reason of a refinancing. 162The conference agreement provides that a tax-payer who has entered into a binding written con-tract before December 15, 2017 to close on the pur-chase of a principal residence before January 1, 2018, and who purchases such residence before April 1, 2018, shall be considered to incurred acquisition in-debtedness prior to December 15, 2017 under this pro-vision. 
163Special rules apply in the case of indebtedness from refinancing existing acquisition indebtedness. Specifically, the $1,000,000 ($500,000 in the case of married taxpayers filing separately) limitation con-tinues to apply to any indebtedness incurred on or after December 15, 2017, to refinance qualified resi-dence indebtedness incurred before that date to the extent the amount of the indebtedness resulting from the refinancing does not exceed the amount of the refinanced indebtedness. Thus, the maximum dollar amount that may be treated as principal resi-dence acquisition indebtedness will not decrease by reason of a refinancing.

These threshold amounts are indexed for inflation. The other-wise allowable itemized deductions may not be reduced by more than 80 percent by rea-son of the overall limit on itemized deduc-tions. 
HOUSE BILL  The House bill repeals the overall limita-tion on itemized deductions. Effective date.—The provision is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The Senate amendment follows the House bill. Under the Senate amendment, the sus-pension of the overall limitation on itemized deductions does not apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the Sen-ate amendment. D. Simplification and Reform of Deductions and Exclusions 1. Modification of deduction for home mort-gage interest (sec. 1302 of the House bill, sec. 11043 of the Senate amendment, and sec. 163(h) of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  As a general matter, personal interest is not deductible.
159Qualified residence inter-est is not treated as personal interest and is allowed as an itemized deduction, subject to limitations.
160Qualified residence interest means interest paid or accrued during the taxable year on either acquisition indebted-ness or home equity indebtedness. A quali-fied residence means the taxpayer’s principal residence and one other residence of the tax-payer selected to be a qualified residence. A qualified residence can be a house, condo-minium, cooperative, mobile home, house trailer, or boat. Acquisition indebtedness Acquisition indebtedness is indebtedness that is incurred in acquiring, constructing, or substantially improving a qualified resi-dence of the taxpayer and which secures the residence. The maximum amount treated as acquisition indebtedness is $1 million ($500,000 in the case of a married person fil-ing a separate return). Acquisition indebtedness also includes in-debtedness from the refinancing of other ac-quisition indebtedness but only to the extent of the amount (and term) of the refinanced indebtedness. Thus, for example, if the tax-payer incurs $200,000 of acquisition indebted-ness to acquire a principal residence and pays down the debt to $150,000, the taxpayer’s acquisition indebtedness with respect to the residence cannot thereafter be increased above $150,000 (except by indebtedness in-curred to substantially improve the resi-dence). Interest on acquisition indebtedness is al-lowable in computing alternative minimum taxable income. However, in the case of a second residence, the acquisition indebted-ness may only be incurred with respect to a house, apartment, condominium, or a mobile home that is not used on a transient basis. Home equity indebtedness Home equity indebtedness is indebtedness (other than acquisition indebtedness) se-cured by a qualified residence. The amount of home equity indebtedness may not exceed $100,000 ($50,000 in the case of a married individual filing a separate return) and may not exceed the fair market value of the residence reduced by the acquisition in-debtedness. Interest on home equity indebtedness is not deductible in computing alternative minimum taxable income. Interest on qualifying home equity indebt-edness is deductible, regardless of how the proceeds of the indebtedness are used. For example, personal expenditures may include health costs and education expenses for the taxpayer’s family members or any other per-sonal expenses such as vacations, furniture, or automobiles. A taxpayer and a mortgage company can contract for the home equity indebtedness loan proceeds to be transferred to the taxpayer in a lump sum payment (e.g., a traditional mortgage), a series of payments (e.g., a reverse mortgage), or the lender may extend the borrower a line of credit up to a fixed limit over the term of the loan (e.g., a home equity line of credit). Thus, the aggregate limitation on the total amount of a taxpayer’s acquisition indebted-ness and home equity indebtedness with re-spect to a taxpayer’s principal residence and a second residence that may give rise to de-ductible interest is $1,100,000 ($550,000, for married persons filing a separate return). HOUSE BILL  The House bill modifies the home mort-gage interest deduction in the following ways. First, under the provision, only interest paid on indebtedness used to acquire, con-struct or substantially improve the tax-payer’s principal residence may be included in the calculation of the deduction. Thus, under the provision, a taxpayer receives no deduction for interest paid on indebtedness used to acquire a second home. Second, under the provision, a taxpayer may treat no more than $500,000 as principal residence acquisition indebtedness ($250,000 in the case of married taxpayers filing sepa-rately). In the case of principal residence ac-quisition indebtedness incurred before the date of introduction (November 2, 2017), this limitation is $1,000,000 ($500,000 in the case of married taxpayers filing separately).
161Al- though the term principal residence acquisi-tion indebtedness is not defined in the stat-ute, it is intended that this ‘‘grandfathering’’ provision apply only with respect to indebtedness incurred with respect to a taxpayer’s principal residence. Last, under the provision, interest paid on home equity indebtedness is not treated as qualified residence interest, and thus is not deductible. This is the case regardless of when the home equity indebtedness was in-curred. Effective date.—The provision is effective for interest paid or accrued in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The Senate amendment suspends the de-duction for interest on home equity indebt-edness. Thus, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, a taxpayer may not claim a deduction for interest on home eq-uity indebtedness. The suspension ends for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025. Effective date.—The provision is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement provides that, in the case of taxable years beginning after De-cember 31, 2017, and beginning before Janu-ary 1, 2026, a taxpayer may treat no more than $750,000 as acquisition indebtedness ($375,000 in the case of married taxpayers fil-ing separately). In the case of acquisition in-debtedness incurred before December 15, 2017
162this limitation is $1,000,000 ($500,000 in the case of married taxpayers filing sepa-rately).
163For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025, a taxpayer may treat up to $1,000,000 ($500,000 in the case of married taxpayers filing separately) of indebtedness as acquisition indebtedness, regardless of when the indebtedness was incurred. Additionally, the conference agreement suspends the deduction for interest on home equity indebtedness. Thus, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, a taxpayer may not claim a deduction for interest on home equity indebtedness. The suspension ends for taxable years beginning after De-cember 31, 2025. Effective date.—The provision is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 2. Modification of deduction for taxes not paid or accrued in a trade or business (sec. 1303 of the House bill, sec. 11042 of the Senate amendment, and sec. 164 of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  Individuals are permitted a deduction for certain taxes paid or accrued, whether or not incurred in a taxpayer’s trade or business. These taxes are: (i) State and local real and foreign property taxes;
164(ii) State and local personal property taxes;
165(iii) State, local, and foreign income, war profits, and excess profits taxes.
166At the election of the tax-payer, an itemized deduction may be taken for State and local general sales taxes in lieu of the itemized deduction for State and local income taxes.
167 Property taxes may be allowed as a deduc-tion in computing adjusted gross income if incurred in connection with property used in a trade or business; otherwise they are an itemized deduction. In the case of State and local income taxes, the deduction is an itemized deduction notwithstanding that the tax may be imposed on profits from a trade or business.
168 Individuals also are permitted a deduction for Federal and State generation skipping transfer tax (‘‘GST tax’’) imposed on certain

169Sec. 164(a)(4). 
170The proposal does not modify the deductibility of GST tax imposed on certain income distributions. Additionally, taxes imposed at the entity level, such as a business tax imposed on pass-through entities, that are reflected in a partner’s or S corporation shareholder’s distributive or pro-rata share of in-come or loss on a Schedule K–1 (or similar form), will continue to reduce such partner’s or share-holder’s distributive or pro-rata share of income as under present law. 
171See sec. 641(b) regarding the computation of taxable income of an estate or trust in the same manner as an individual. 
172The proposal does not modify the deductibility of GST tax imposed on certain income distributions. Additionally, taxes imposed at the entity level, such as a business tax imposed on pass-through entities, that are reflected in a partner’s or S corporation shareholder’s distributive or pro-rata share of in-come or loss on a Schedule K–1 (or similar form), will continue to reduce such partner’s or share-holder’s distributive or pro-rata share of income as under present law. 
173Sec. 165(c). 
174Pub. L. No. 115–63. 175Sec. 165(d). 
176The provision thus reverses the result reached by the Tax Court in Ronald A. Mayo v. Commissioner, 136 T.C. 81 (2011). In that case, the Court held that a taxpayer’s expenses incurred in the conduct of the trade or business of gambling, other than the cost of wagers, were not limited by sec. 165(d), and were thus deductible under sec. 162(a). income distributions that are included in the gross income of the distributee.
169 In determining a taxpayer’s alternative minimum taxable income, no itemized de-duction for property, income, or sales tax is allowed. 
HOUSE BILL  Under the provision, in the case of an indi-vidual, as a general matter, State, local, and foreign property taxes and State and local sales taxes are allowed as a deduction only when paid or accrued in carrying on a trade or business, or an activity described in sec-tion 212 (relating to expenses for the produc-tion of income).
170Thus, the provision allows only those deductions for State, local, and foreign property taxes, and sales taxes, that are presently deductible in computing in-come on an individual’s Schedule C, Sched-ule E, or Schedule F on such individual’s tax return. Thus, for instance, in the case of property taxes, an individual may deduct such items only if these taxes were imposed on business assets (such as residential rental property). The provision contains an exception to the above-stated rule in the case of real property taxes. Under this exception, an individual may claim an itemized deduction of up to $10,000 ($5,000 for married taxpayer filing a separate return) for property taxes paid or accrued in the taxable year, in addition to any property taxes deducted in carrying on a trade or business or an activity described in section 212. Foreign real property taxes may not be deducted under this exception. Under the provision, in the case of an indi-vidual, State and local income, war profits, and excess profits taxes are not allowable as a deduction. It is intended that persons required to re-port refunds of State and local income taxes under section 6050E should no longer be re-quired to report such refunds of tax relating to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. A technical amendment may be needed to reflect this intent. Effective date.—The provision is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The Senate amendment follows the House bill. However, under the Senate amendment, the suspension of the deduction for State and local taxes expires for taxable years begin-ning after December 31, 2025. Effective date.—The provision is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement provides that in the case of an individual,
171as a general mat-ter, State, local, and foreign property taxes and State and local sales taxes are allowed as a deduction only when paid or accrued in carrying on a trade or business, or an activ-ity described in section 212 (relating to ex-penses for the production of income).
172 Thus, the provision allows only those deduc-tions for State, local, and foreign property taxes, and sales taxes, that are presently de-ductible in computing income on an individ-ual’s Schedule C, Schedule E, or Schedule F on such individual’s tax return. Thus, for in-stance, in the case of property taxes, an indi-vidual may deduct such items only if these taxes were imposed on business assets (such as residential rental property). Under the provision, in the case of an indi-vidual, State and local income, war profits, and excess profits taxes are not allowable as a deduction. The provision contains an exception to the above-stated rule. Under the provision a tax-payer may claim an itemized deduction of up to $10,000 ($5,000 for married taxpayer filing a separate return) for the aggregate of (i) State and local property taxes not paid or accrued in carrying on a trade or business, or an activity described in section 212, and (ii) State and local income, war profits, and ex-cess profits taxes (or sales taxes in lieu of in-come, etc. taxes) paid or accrued in the tax-able year. Foreign real property taxes may not be deducted under this exception. The above rules apply to taxable years be-ginning after December 31, 2017, and begin-ning before January 1, 2026. The conference agreement also provides that, in the case of an amount paid in a tax-able year beginning before January 1, 2018, with respect to a State or local income tax imposed for a taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017, the payment shall be treated as paid on the last day of the taxable year for which such tax is so imposed for purposes of applying the provision limiting the dollar amount of the deduction. Thus, under the provision, an individual may not claim an itemized deduction in 2017 on a pre- payment of income tax for a future taxable year in order to avoid the dollar limitation applicable for taxable years beginning after 2017. Effective date.—The provision is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2016. 3. Repeal of deduction for personal casualty and theft losses (sec. 1304 of the House bill, sec. 11044 of the Senate amendment, and sec. 165 of the Code) PRESENT LAW  A taxpayer may generally claim a deduc-tion for any loss sustained during the tax-able year, not compensated by insurance or otherwise. For individual taxpayers, deduct-ible losses must be incurred in a trade or business or other profit-seeking activity or consist of property losses arising from fire, storm, shipwreck, or other casualty, or from theft.
173Personal casualty or theft losses are deductible only if they exceed $100 per cas-ualty or theft. In addition, aggregate net casualty and theft losses are deductible only to the extent they exceed 10 percent of an in-dividual taxpayer’s adjusted gross income. 
HOUSE BILL  The House bill repeals the deduction for personal casualty and theft losses. However, notwithstanding the repeal of the deduction, the provision retains the benefit of the de-duction, as modified by the Disaster Tax Re-lief and Airport and Airway Extension Act of 2017,
174for those individuals who sustained a personal casualty loss arising from hurri-canes Harvey, Irma, or Maria. Effective date.—The provision is effective for losses incurred in taxable years begin-ning after December 31, 2017. SENATE AMENDMENT  The Senate amendment temporarily modi-fies the deduction for personal casualty and theft losses. Under the provision, a taxpayer may claim a personal casualty loss (subject to the limitations described above) only if such loss was attributable to a disaster de-clared by the President under section 401 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act. The above-described limitation does not apply with respect to losses incurred after December 31, 2025. Effective date.—The provision is effective for losses incurred in taxable years begin-ning after December 31, 2017. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the Sen-ate amendment. 4. Limitation on wagering losses (sec. 1305 of the House bill, sec. 11051 of the Senate amendment, and sec. 165 of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  Losses sustained during the taxable year on wagering transactions are allowed as a deduction only to the extent of the gains during the taxable year from such trans-actions.
175 
HOUSE BILL  The House bill clarifies the scope of ‘‘losses from wagering transactions’’ as that term is used in section 165(d). Under the provision, this term includes any deduction otherwise allowable under chapter 1 of the Code in-curred in carrying on any wagering trans-action. The provision is intended to clarify that the limitation on losses from wagering transactions applies not only to the actual costs of wagers incurred by an individual, but to other expenses incurred by the indi-vidual in connection with the conduct of that individual’s gambling activity.
176The provision clarifies, for instance, an individ-ual’s otherwise deductible expenses in trav-eling to or from a casino are subject to the limitation under section 165(d). Effective date.—The provision is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The Senate amendment follows the House bill. However, the Senate amendment does not apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the Sen-ate amendment. 5. Modifications to the deduction for chari-table contributions (sec. 1306 of the House bill, secs. 11023, 13703, and 13704 of the Senate amendment, and sec. 170 of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  In general The Internal Revenue Code allows tax-payers to reduce their income tax liability by taking deductions for contributions to certain organizations, including charities, Federal, State, local, and Indian tribal gov-ernments, and certain other organizations. To be deductible, a charitable contribution generally must meet several threshold re-quirements. First, the recipient of the trans-fer must be eligible to receive charitable

181Treas. Reg. sec. 1.170A–5(a)(4). Treasury regula-tions provide that section 170(a)(3), which generally denies a deduction for a contribution of a future in-terest in tangible personal property, has ‘‘no appli-cation in respect of a transfer of an undivided present interest in property. For example, a con-tribution of an undivided one-quarter interest in a painting with respect to which the donee is entitled to possession during three months of each year shall be treated as made upon the receipt by the donee of a formally executed and acknowledged deed of gift. However, the period of initial possession by the donee may not be deferred in time for more than one year.’’ Treas. Reg. sec. 1.170A–5(a)(2). 182Sec. 170(f)(3)(B)(ii).

Second, the transfer must be made with gratuitous in-tent and without the expectation of a benefit of substantial economic value in return. Third, the transfer must be complete and generally must be a transfer of a donor’s en-tire interest in the contributed property ( i.e., not a contingent or partial interest contribu-tion). To qualify for a current year chari-table deduction, payment of the contribution must be made within the taxable year.
177 Fourth, the transfer must be of money or property—contributions of services are not deductible.
178Finally, the transfer must be substantiated and in the proper form. As discussed below, special rules limit the deductibility of a taxpayer’s charitable con-tributions in a given year to a percentage of income, and those rules, in part, turn on whether the organization receiving the con-tributions is a public charity or a private foundation. Other special rules determine the deductible value of contributed property for each type of property. Contributions of partial interests in property In general In general, a charitable deduction is not al-lowed for income, estate, or gift tax purposes if the donor transfers an interest in property to a charity while retaining an interest in that property or transferring an interest in that property to a noncharity for less than full and adequate consideration.
179This rule of nondeductibility, often referred to as the partial interest rule, generally prohibits a charitable deduction for contributions of in-come interests, remainder interests, or rights to use property. A charitable contribution deduction gen-erally is not allowable for a contribution of a future interest in tangible personal prop-erty.
180For this purpose, a future interest is one ‘‘in which a donor purports to give tan-gible personal property to a charitable orga-nization, but has an understanding, arrange-ment, agreement, etc., whether written or oral, with the charitable organization that has the effect of reserving to, or retaining in, such donor a right to the use, possession, or enjoyment of the property.’’
181 A gift of an undivided portion of a donor’s entire interest in property generally is not treated as a nondeductible gift of a partial interest in property.
182For this purpose, an undivided portion of a donor’s entire interest in property must consist of a fraction or per-centage of each and every substantial inter-est or right owned by the donor in such prop-erty and must extend over the entire term of the donor’s interest in such property.183A gift generally is treated as a gift of an undi-vided portion of a donor’s entire interest in property if the donee is given the right, as a tenant in common with the donor, to posses-sion, dominion, and control of the property for a portion of each year appropriate to its interest in such property.
184 Other exceptions to the partial interest rule are provided for, among other interests: (1) remainder interests in charitable remain-der annuity trusts, charitable remainder unitrusts, and pooled income funds; (2) present interests in the form of a guaranteed annuity or a fixed percentage of the annual value of the property; (3) a remainder inter-est in a personal residence or farm; and (4) qualified conservation contributions. Qualified conservation contributions Qualified conservation contributions are not subject to the partial interest rule, which generally bars deductions for chari-table contributions of partial interests in property.
185A qualified conservation con-tribution is a contribution of a qualified real property interest to a qualified organization exclusively for conservation purposes. A qualified real property interest is defined as: (1) the entire interest of the donor other than a qualified mineral interest; (2) a re-mainder interest; or (3) a restriction (grant-ed in perpetuity) on the use that may be made of the real property (generally, a con-servation easement). Qualified organizations include certain governmental units, public charities that meet certain public support tests, and certain supporting organizations. Conservation purposes include: (1) the pres-ervation of land areas for outdoor recreation by, or for the education of, the general pub-lic; (2) the protection of a relatively natural habitat of fish, wildlife, or plants, or similar ecosystem; (3) the preservation of open space (including farmland and forest land) where such preservation will yield a significant public benefit and is either for the scenic en-joyment of the general public or pursuant to a clearly delineated Federal, State, or local governmental conservation policy; and (4) the preservation of an historically important land area or a certified historic structure. Percentage limits on charitable contributions Individual taxpayers Charitable contributions by individual tax-payers are limited to a specified percentage of the individual’s contribution base. The contribution base is the taxpayer’s adjusted gross income (‘‘AGI’’) for a taxable year, dis-regarding any net operating loss carryback to the year under section 172.
186In general, more favorable (higher) percentage limits apply to contributions of cash and ordinary income property than to contributions of capital gain property. More favorable limits also generally apply to contributions to pub-lic charities (and certain operating founda-tions) than to contributions to nonoperating private foundations. More specifically, the deduction for chari-table contributions by an individual tax-payer of cash and property that is not appre-ciated to a charitable organization described in section 170(b)(1)(A) (public charities, pri-vate foundations other than nonoperating private foundations, and certain govern-mental units) may not exceed 50 percent of the taxpayer’s contribution base. Contribu-tions of this type of property to nonop-erating private foundations generally may be deducted up to the lesser of 30 percent of the taxpayer’s contribution base or the excess of (i) 50 percent of the contribution base over (ii) the amount of contributions subject to the 50 percent limitation. Contributions of appreciated capital gain property to public charities and other orga-nizations described in section 170(b)(1)(A) generally are deductible up to 30 percent of the taxpayer’s contribution base (after tak-ing into account contributions other than contributions of capital gain property). An individual may elect, however, to bring all these contributions of appreciated capital gain property for a taxable year within the 50-percent limitation category by reducing the amount of the contribution deduction by the amount of the appreciation in the capital gain property. Contributions of appreciated capital gain property to nonoperating pri-vate foundations are deductible up to the lesser of 20 percent of the taxpayer’s con-tribution base or the excess of (i) 30 percent of the contribution base over (ii) the amount of contributions subject to the 30 percent limitation. Finally, contributions that are for the use of (not to) the donee charity get less favor-able percentage limits. Contributions of cap-ital gain property for the use of public char-ities and other organizations described in section 170(b)(1)(A) also are limited to 20 per-cent of the taxpayer’s contribution base. Property contributed for the use of an orga-nization generally has been interpreted to mean property contributed in trust for the organization.187Charitable contributions of income interests (where deductible) also gen-erally are treated as contributions for the use of the donee organization.

188Percentages shown are the percentage of an in-dividual’s contribution base. 
189Capital gain property contributed to public charities, private operating foundations, or private distributing foundations will be subject to the 50- percent limitation if the donor elects to reduce the fair market value of the property by the amount that would have been long-term capital gain if the property had been sold. 
190Certain qualified conservation contributions to public charities (generally, conservation ease-ments), qualify for more generous contribution lim-its. In general, the 30-percent limit applicable to contributions of capital gain property is increased to 100 percent if the individual making the qualified conservation contribution is a qualified farmer or rancher or to 50 percent if the individual is not a qualified farmer or rancher.

206Under present and prior law, certain copyrights are not considered capital assets, such that the charitable deduction for such copyrights generally is limited to the taxpayer’s basis. See sec. 1221(a)(3), 1231(b)(1)(C). 
207Sec. 170(e)(1)(B)(iii). Corporate taxpayers A corporation generally may deduct chari-table contributions up to 10 percent of the corporation’s taxable income for the year.
191 For this purpose, taxable income is deter-mined without regard to: (1) the charitable contributions deduction; (2) any net oper-ating loss carryback to the taxable year; (3) deductions for dividends received; (4) deduc-tions for dividends paid on certain preferred stock of public utilities; and (5) any capital loss carryback to the taxable year.
192 Carryforwards of excess contributions Charitable contributions that exceed the applicable percentage limit generally may be carried forward for up to five years.
193In general, contributions carried over from a prior year are taken into account after con-tributions for the current year that are sub-ject to the same percentage limit. Excess contributions made for the use of (rather than to) an organization generally may not be carried forward. Qualified conservation contributions Preferential percentage limits and carryforward rules apply for qualified con-servation contributions.
194In general, the 30- percent contribution base limitation on con-tributions of capital gain property by indi-viduals does not apply to qualified conserva-tion contributions. Instead, individuals may deduct the fair market value of any qualified conservation contribution to an organization described in section 170(b)(1)(A) (generally, public charities) to the extent of the excess of 50 percent of the contribution base over the amount of all other allowable charitable contributions. These contributions are not taken into account in determining the amount of other allowable charitable con-tributions. Individuals are allowed to carry forward any qualified conservation contribu-tions that exceed the 50-percent limitation for up to 15 years. In the case of an indi-vidual who is a qualified farmer or rancher for the taxable year in which the contribu-tion is made, a qualified conservation con-tribution is allowable up to 100 percent of the excess of the taxpayer’s contribution base over the amount of all other allowable charitable contributions. In the case of a corporation (other than a publicly traded corporation) that is a quali-fied farmer or rancher for the taxable year in which the contribution is made, any quali-fied conservation contribution is allowable up to 100 percent of the excess of the cor-poration’s taxable income (as computed under section 170(b)(2)) over the amount of all other allowable charitable contributions. Any excess may be carried forward for up to 15 years as a contribution subject to the 100- percent limitation.
195 A qualified farmer or rancher means a tax-payer whose gross income from the trade or business of farming (within the meaning of section 2032A(e)(5)) is greater than 50 percent of the taxpayer’s gross income for the tax-able year. Valuation of charitable contributions In general For purposes of the income tax charitable deduction, the value of property contributed to charity may be limited to the fair market value of the property, the donor’s tax basis in the property, or in some cases a different amount. Charitable contributions of cash are de-ductible in the amount contributed, subject to the percentage limits discussed above. In addition, a taxpayer generally may deduct the full fair market value of long-term cap-ital gain property contributed to charity.196 Contributions of tangible personal property also generally are deductible at fair market value if the use by the recipient charitable organization is related to its tax-exempt pur-pose. In certain other cases, however, section 170(e) limits the deductible value of the con-tribution of appreciated property to the do-nor’s tax basis in the property. This limita-tion of the property’s deductible value to basis generally applies, for example, for: (1) contributions of inventory or other ordinary income or short-term capital gain prop-erty;
197(2) contributions of tangible personal property if the use by the recipient chari-table organization is unrelated to the organi-zation’s tax-exempt purpose;
198and (3) con- tributions to or for the use of a private foun-dation (other than certain private operating foundations).
199 For contributions of qualified appreciated stock, the above-described rule that limits the value of property contributed to or for the use of a private nonoperating foundation to the taxpayer’s basis in the property does not apply; therefore, subject to certain lim-its, contributions of qualified appreciated stock to a nonoperating private foundation may be deducted at fair market value.
200 Qualified appreciated stock is stock that is capital gain property and for which (as of the date of the contribution) market quotations are readily available on an established secu-rities market.
201A contribution of qualified appreciated stock (when increased by the ag-gregate amount of all prior such contribu-tions by the donor of stock in the corpora-tion) generally does not include a contribu-tion of stock to the extent the amount of the stock contributed exceeds 10 percent (in value) of all of the outstanding stock of the corporation.
202 Contributions of property with a fair mar-ket value that is less than the donor’s tax basis generally are deductible at the fair market value of the property. Enhanced deduction rules for certain con-tributions of inventory and other property Although most charitable contributions of property are valued at fair market value or the donor’s tax basis in the property, certain statutorily described contributions of appre-ciated inventory and other property qualify for an enhanced deduction valuation that ex-ceeds the donor’s tax basis in the property, but which is less than the fair market value of the property. As discussed above, a taxpayer’s deduction for charitable contributions of inventory property generally is limited to the tax-payer’s basis (typically, cost) in the inven-tory, or if less, the fair market value of the property. For certain contributions of inven-tory, however, C corporations (but not other taxpayers) may claim an enhanced deduction equal to the lesser of (1) basis plus one-half of the item’s appreciation (i.e., basis plus one-half of fair market value in excess of basis) or (2) two times basis.203To be eligible for the enhanced deduction value, the con-tributed property generally must be inven-tory of the taxpayer, contributed to a chari-table organization described in section 501(c)(3) (except for private nonoperating foundations), and the donee must (1) use the property consistent with the donee’s exempt purpose solely for the care of the ill, the needy, or infants, (2) not transfer the prop-erty in exchange for money, other property, or services, and (3) provide the taxpayer a written statement that the donee’s use of the property will be consistent with such re-quirements.
204Contributions to organiza-tions that are not described in section 501(c)(3), such as governmental entities, do not qualify for this enhanced deduction. To use the enhanced deduction provision, the taxpayer must establish that the fair market value of the donated item exceeds basis. A taxpayer engaged in a trade or business, whether or not a C corporation, is eligible to claim the enhanced deduction for certain do-nations of food inventory.
205 Selected statutory rules for specific types of contributions Special statutory rules limit the deduct-ible value (and impose enhanced reporting obligations on donors) of charitable con-tributions of certain types of property, in-cluding vehicles, intellectual property, and clothing and household items. Each of these rules was enacted in response to concerns that some taxpayers did not accurately re-port—and in many instances overstated—the value of the property for purposes of claim-ing a charitable deduction. Vehicle donations.—Under present law, the amount of deduction for charitable contribu-tions of vehicles (generally including auto-mobiles, boats, and airplanes for which the claimed value exceeds $500 and excluding in-ventory property) depends upon the use of the vehicle by the donee organization. If the donee organization sells the vehicle without any significant intervening use or material improvement of such vehicle by the organi-zation, the amount of the deduction may not exceed the gross proceeds received from the sale. In other situations, a fair market value deduction may be allowed. Patents and other intellectual property. —If a taxpayer contributes a patent or other intel-lectual property (other than certain copy-rights or inventory)
206to a charitable orga-nization, the taxpayer’s initial charitable de-duction is limited to the lesser of the tax-payer’s basis in the contributed property or the fair market value of the property.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H10013 December 15, 2017 
208The present-law rules allowing additional chari-table deductions for qualified donee income were en-acted as part of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, and are effective for contributions made after June 3, 2004. For a more detailed description of these rules, see Joint Committee on Taxation, General Ex- planation of Tax Legislation Enacted in the 108th Con-gress (JCS–5–05), May 2005, pp. 457–461. 
209As is discussed above, the charitable contribu-tion substantiation rules generally require a quali-fied appraisal where the claimed value of a contribu-tion is more than $5,000. 
210The special rules concerning the deductibility of clothing and household items were enacted as part of the Pension Protection Act of 2006, P.L. 109– 280 (August 17, 2006), and are effective for contribu-tions made after August 17, 2006. For a more detailed description of these rules, see Joint Committee on Taxation, General Explanation of Tax Legislation En-acted in the 109th Congress (JCS–1–07), January 17, 2007, pp. 597–600. 211Sec. 170(l). 
212Treas. Reg. sec. 1.170A–1(g). 
213Sec. 170(j). 
214Sec. 170(i). 
215In lieu of actual operating expenses, an optional standard mileage rate may be used in computing de-ductible transportation expenses for medical pur-poses (section 213) or for work-related moving (sec-tion 217). The standard mileage rates for medical and moving purposes generally cover only out-of- pocket operating expenses (including gasoline and oil) directly related to the use of the automobile. Such rates do not include costs that are not deduct-ible for medical or moving purposes, such as general maintenance expenses, depreciation, insurance, and registration fees. The medical and moving standard mileage rates are determined by the IRS and up-dated periodically. For expenses paid or incurred on or after January 1, 2017, the rate for both such pur-poses is 17 cents per mile. IRS Notice 2016–79. 
216Sec. 170(f)(17). 217Such acknowledgement must include the amount of cash and a description (but not value) of any property other than cash contributed, whether the donee provided any goods or services in consid-eration for the contribution, and a good faith esti-mate of the value of any such goods or services. Sec. 170(f)(8). 
218Sec. 6115. 
219Sec. 170(f)(11). 
220See IRS, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, Sub-stantiation Requirement for Certain Contributions, REG–138344–13 (October 13, 2015), I.R.B. 2015–41 (pre-amble). 
221In October 2015, the IRS issued proposed regula-tions that, if finalized, would have implemented the section 170(f)(8)(D) exception to the contempora-neous written acknowledgment requirement. The proposed regulations provided that a return filed by a donee organization under section 170(f)(8)(D) must include, in addition to the information generally re-quired on a contemporaneous written acknowledg-ment: (1) the name and address of the donee organi-zation; (2) the name and address of the donor; and (3) the taxpayer identification number of the donor. In addition, the return must be filed with the IRS (with a copy provided to the donor) on or before February 28 of the year following the calendar year in which the contribution was made. Under the proposed reg-ulations, donee reporting would have been optional and would have been available solely at the discre-tion of the donee organization. The proposed regula-tions were withdrawn in January 2016. See Prop. Treas. Reg. sec 1.170A–13(f)(18). addition, the taxpayer generally is permitted to deduct, as a charitable contribution, cer-tain additional amounts in the year of con-tribution or in subsequent taxable years based on a specified percentage of the quali-fied donee income received or accrued by the charitable donee with respect to the contrib-uted intellectual property. For this purpose, qualified donee income includes net income received or accrued by the donee that prop-erly is allocable to the intellectual property itself (as opposed to the activity in which the intellectual property is used).
208 Clothing and household items.—Charitable contributions of clothing and household items generally are subject to the charitable deduction rules applicable to tangible per-sonal property. If such contributed property is appreciated property in the hands of the taxpayer, and is not used to further the donee’s exempt purpose, the deduction is limited to basis. In most situations, how-ever, clothing and household items have a fair market value that is less than the tax-payer’s basis in the property. Because prop-erty with a fair market value less than basis generally is deductible at the property’s fair market value, taxpayers generally may de-duct only the fair market value of most con-tributions of clothing or household items, re-gardless of whether the property is used for exempt or unrelated purposes by the donee organization. Furthermore, a special rule generally provides that no deduction is al-lowed for a charitable contribution of cloth-ing or a household item unless the item is in good used or better condition. The Secretary is authorized to deny by regulation a deduc-tion for any contribution of clothing or a household item that has minimal monetary value, such as used socks and used undergar-ments. Notwithstanding the general rule, a charitable contribution of clothing or house-hold items not in good used or better condi-tion with a claimed value of more than $500 may be deducted if the taxpayer includes with the taxpayer’s return a qualified ap-praisal with respect to the property.
209 Household items include furniture, fur-nishings, electronics, appliances, linens, and other similar items. Food, paintings, an-tiques, and other objects of art, jewelry and gems, and certain collections are excluded from the special rules described in the pre-ceding paragraph.
210 College athletic seating rights.—In general, where a taxpayer receives or expects to re-ceive a substantial return benefit for a pay-ment to charity, the payment is not deduct-ible as a charitable contribution. However, special rules apply to certain payments to institutions of higher education in exchange for which the payor receives the right to pur-chase tickets or seating at an athletic event. Specifically, the payor may treat 80 percent of a payment as a charitable contribution where: (1) the amount is paid to or for the benefit of an institution of higher education (as defined in section 3304(f)) described in section (b)(1)(A)(ii) (generally, a school with a regular faculty and curriculum and meet-ing certain other requirements), and (2) such amount would be allowable as a charitable deduction but for the fact that the taxpayer receives (directly or indirectly) as a result of the payment the right to purchase tickets for seating at an athletic event in an ath-letic stadium of such institution.211 Use of a vehicle when volunteering for a char-ity Unreimbursed out-of-pocket expenditures made incident to providing donated services to a qualified charitable organization—such as out-of-pocket transportation expenses necessarily incurred in performing donated services—may qualify as a charitable con-tribution.
212No charitable contribution de-duction is allowed for traveling expenses (in-cluding expenses for meals and lodging) while away from home, whether paid directly or by reimbursement, unless there is no sig-nificant element of personal pleasure, recre-ation, or vacation in such travel.
213 In determining the amount treated as a charitable contribution where a taxpayer op-erates a vehicle in providing donated serv-ices to a charity, the taxpayer either may track and deduct actual out-of-pocket ex-penditures or, in the case of a passenger automobile, may use the charitable standard mileage rate. The charitable standard mile-age rate is set by statute at 14 cents per mile.
214The taxpayer may also deduct (under either computation method), any parking fees and tolls incurred in rendering the serv-ices, but may not deduct any amount (re-gardless of the computation method used) for general repair or maintenance expenses, de-preciation, insurance, registration fees, etc. Regardless of the computation method used, the taxpayer must keep reliable written records of expenses incurred. For example, where a taxpayer uses the charitable stand-ard mileage rate to determine a deduction, the IRS has stated that the taxpayer gen-erally must maintain records of miles driv-en, time, place (or use), and purpose of the mileage. If the charitable standard mileage rate is not used to determine the deduction, the taxpayer generally must maintain reli-able written records of actual expenses in-curred.
215 Substantiation and other formal require-ments In general A donor who claims a deduction for a char-itable contribution must maintain reliable written records regarding the contribution, regardless of the value or amount of such contribution.
216In the case of a charitable contribution of money, regardless of the amount, applicable recordkeeping require-ments are satisfied only if the donor main-tains as a record of the contribution a bank record or a written communication from the donee showing the name of the donee organi-zation, the date of the contribution, and the amount of the contribution. In such cases, the recordkeeping requirements may not be satisfied by maintaining other written records. No charitable contribution deduction is al-lowed for a separate contribution of $250 or more unless the donor obtains a contempora-neous written acknowledgement of the con-tribution from the charity indicating wheth-er the charity provided any good or service (and an estimate of the value of any such good or service) to the taxpayer in consider-ation for the contribution.217 In addition, any charity receiving a con-tribution exceeding $75 made partly as a gift and partly as consideration for goods or serv-ices furnished by the charity (a ‘‘quid pro quo’’ contribution) is required to inform the contributor in writing of an estimate of the value of the goods or services furnished by the charity and that only the portion exceed-ing the value of the goods or services is de-ductible as a charitable contribution.
218 If the total charitable deduction claimed for noncash property is more than $500, the taxpayer must attach a completed Form 8283 (Noncash Charitable Contributions) to the taxpayer’s return or the deduction is not al-lowed.
219In general, taxpayers are required to obtain a qualified appraisal for donated property with a value of more than $5,000, and to attach an appraisal summary to the tax return. Exception for certain contributions reported by the donee organization Subsection 170(f)(8)(D) provides an excep-tion to the contemporaneous written ac-knowledgment requirement described above. Under the exception, a contemporaneous written acknowledgment is not required if the donee organization files a return, on such form and in accordance with such regu-lations as the Secretary may prescribe, that includes the same content. ‘‘[T]he section 170(f)(8)(D) exception is not available unless and until the Treasury Department and the IRS issue final regulations prescribing the method by which donee reporting may be ac-complished.’’
220No such final regulations have been issued.

HOUSE BILL  The provision makes the following modi-fications to the present law charitable de-duction rules.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH10014 December 15, 2017 
222Sec. 67(a). 
223The miscellaneous itemized deduction for tax preparation expenses is described in a separate sec-tion of this document. 
224Sec. 212(1). 
225See IRS Publication 529, ‘‘Miscellaneous Deduc- tions’’ (2016), p. 9. 
226Sec. 212. 
227Secs. 62(a)(1) and 67. 
228See IRS Publication 529, ‘‘Miscellaneous Deduc- tions’’ (2016), p. 3. 
229Under a special provision, these expenses are de-ductible ‘‘above the line’’ up to $250. 230Sec. 213. The threshold was amended by the Pa-tient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Pub. L. No. 111–118). For taxable years beginning before Jan-uary 1, 2013, the threshold was 7.5 percent and 10 per-cent for alternative minimum tax (‘‘AMT’’) pur-poses. Increased percentage limit for contributions of cash to public charities The provision increases the income-based percentage limit described in section 170(b)(1)(A) for certain charitable contribu-tions by an individual taxpayer of cash to public charities and certain other organiza-tions from 50 percent to 60 percent. Charitable mileage rate adjusted for inflation The provision repeals the statutory chari-table mileage rate and provides instead that the standard mileage rate used for deter-mining the charitable contribution deduc-tion shall be a rate which takes into account the variable costs of operating an auto-mobile. The intent of the provision is to allow the IRS to determine, and make peri-odic adjustments to, the charitable standard mileage rate, taking into account the types of costs that are deductible under section 170 of the Code when operating a vehicle in con-nection with providing volunteer services (i.e., generally, the out-of-pocket operating expenses (including gasoline and oil) directly related to the use of the automobile for such purposes). Denial of charitable deduction for college athletic event seating rights The provision amends section 170(l) to pro-vide that no charitable deduction shall be al-lowed for any amount described in paragraph 170(l)(2), generally, a payment to an institu-tion of higher education in exchange for which the payor receives the right to pur-chase tickets or seating at an athletic event, as described in greater detail above. Repeal of substantiation exception for certain contributions reported by the donee orga-nization The provision repeals the section 170(f)(8)(D) exception to the contempora-neous written acknowledgment requirement. Effective date.—The provision is effective for contributions made in taxable years be-ginning after December 31, 2017 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The Senate amendment includes three of the House bill’s four modifications to the present-law charitable contribution rules: (1) the increase in the percentage limit for char-itable contributions of cash to public char-ities; (2) the denial of a charitable deduction for payments made in exchange for college athletic event seating rights; and (3) the re-peal of the substantiation exception for cer-tain contributions reported by the donee or-ganization. The Senate amendment does not include the provision from the House bill that allows the charitable standard mileage rate to be adjusted for inflation. Effective date.—The provisions that in-crease the charitable contribution percent-age limit and deny a deduction for stadium seating payments are effective for contribu-tions made in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. The provision that repeals the substantiation exception for certain con-tributions reported by the donee organiza-tion is effective for contributions made in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2016. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the Sen-ate amendment. 6. Repeal of Certain Miscellaneous Itemized Deductions Subject to the Two-Percent Floor (secs. 1307 and 1312 of the House bill, sec. 11045 of the Senate amendment, and secs. 62, 67 and 212 of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  Individuals may claim itemized deductions for certain miscellaneous expenses. Certain of these expenses are not deductible unless, in aggregate, they exceed two percent of the taxpayer’s adjusted gross income (‘‘AGI’’).222 The deductions described below are subject to the aggregate two-percent floor.
223 Expenses for the production or collection of income Individuals may deduct all ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year for the production or collec-tion of income.
224 Present law and IRS guidance provide ex-amples of items that may be deducted under this provision. This non-exhaustive list in-cludes:
225 ∑Appraisal fees for a casualty loss or char-itable contribution; ∑Casualty and theft losses from property used in performing services as an employee; ∑Clerical help and office rent in caring for investments; ∑Depreciation on home computers used for investments; ∑Excess deductions (including administra-tive expenses) allowed a beneficiary on ter-mination of an estate or trust; ∑Fees to collect interest and dividends; ∑Hobby expenses, but generally not more than hobby income; ∑Indirect miscellaneous deductions from pass-through entities; ∑Investment fees and expenses; ∑Loss on deposits in an insolvent or bank-rupt financial institution; ∑Loss on traditional IRAs or Roth IRAs, when all amounts have been distributed; ∑Repayments of income; ∑Safe deposit box rental fees, except for storing jewelry and other personal effects; ∑Service charges on dividend reinvest-ment plans; and ∑Trustee’s fees for an IRA, if separately billed and paid. Tax preparation expenses For regular income tax purposes, individ-uals are allowed an itemized deduction for expenses for the production of income. These expenses are defined as ordinary and nec-essary expenses paid or incurred in a taxable year: (1) for the production or collection of income; (2) for the management, conserva-tion, or maintenance of property held for the production of income; or (3) in connection with the determination, collection, or refund of any tax.
226 Unreimbursed expenses attributable to the trade or business of being an employee In general, unreimbursed business expenses incurred by an employee are deductible, but only as an itemized deduction and only to the extent the expenses exceed two percent of adjusted gross income.

Other miscellaneous itemized deductions sub-ject to the two-percent floor Other miscellaneous itemized deductions subject to the two-percent floor include: ∑Repayments of income received under a claim of right (only subject to the two-per-cent floor if less than $3,000); ∑Repayments of Social Security benefits; and ∑The share of deductible investment ex-penses from pass-through entities. HOUSE BILL  The House bill repeals the deduction for expenses in connection with the determina-tion, collection, or refund of any tax. Under the provision, business expenses in-curred by an employee are not deductible, other than expenses that are deductible in determining adjusted gross income (that is, above-the-line deductions). Effective date.—The provision is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The Senate amendment suspends all mis-cellaneous itemized deductions that are sub-ject to the two-percent floor under present law. Thus, under the provision, taxpayers may not claim the above-listed items as itemized deductions for the taxable years to which the suspension applies.

238A technical amendment may be needed to re-flect this intent for the deduction for moving ex-penses for members of the Armed Forces. 
239Under the provision, these exclusions are added to section 134. 240Archer MSAs were originally called medical savings accounts or MSAs. 
241The FICA exclusion is provided under IRS No-tice 96–53. 
242Sections 106(b) and 220. 2017, the 10-percent threshold is reduced to 7.5 percent in the case of taxpayers who have attained the age of 65 before the close of the taxable year. In the case of married tax-payers, the 7.5 percent threshold applies if ei-ther spouse has obtained the age of 65 before the close of the taxable year. For these tax-payers, during these years, the threshold is 10 percent for AMT purposes. 
HOUSE BILL  The House bill repeals the deduction for unreimbursed medical expenses. Effective date.—The provision is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The Senate amendment provides that, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2016 and ending before January 1, 2019, the threshold for deducting medical expenses shall be 7.5-percent for all taxpayers. For these years, this threshold applies for pur-poses of the AMT in addition to the regular tax. Effective date.—The provision is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2016. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the Sen-ate amendment. 8. Repeal of deduction for alimony payments and corresponding inclusion in gross in-come (sec. 1309 of the House bill and secs. 61, 71, and 215 of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  Alimony and separate maintenance pay-ments are deductible by the payor spouse and includible in income by the recipient spouse.
231Child support payments are not treated as alimony.
232 
HOUSE BILL  Under the House bill, alimony and separate maintenance payments are not deductible by the payor spouse. The House bill repeals the Code provisions that specify that alimony and separate maintenance payments are in-cluded in income. Thus, the intent of the provision is to follow the rule of the United States Supreme Court’s holding in Gould v. Gould,
233in which the Court held that such payments are not income to the recipient. Income used for alimony payments is taxed at the rates applicable to the payor spouse rather than the recipient spouse. The treat-ment of child support is not changed. Effective date.—The provision is effective for any divorce or separation instrument ex-ecuted after December 31, 2017, or for any di-vorce or separation instrument executed on or before December 31, 2017, and modified after that date, if the modification expressly provides that the amendments made by this section apply to such modification. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  No provision. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement generally fol-lows the House bill. However, the conference agreement delays the effective date of the provision by one year. Thus, the conference agreement is effective for any divorce or sep-aration instrument executed after December 31, 2018, or for any divorce or separation in-strument executed on or before December 31, 2018, and modified after that date, if the modification expressly provides that the amendments made by this section apply to such modification. 9. Repeal of deduction for moving expenses (sec. 1310 of the House bill, sec. 11050 of the Senate amendment, and sec. 217 of the Code) PRESENT LAW  Individuals are permitted an above-the- line deduction for moving expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year in connec-tion with the commencement of work by the taxpayer as an employee or as a self-em-ployed individual at a new principal place of work.
234Such expenses are deductible only if the move meets certain conditions related to distance from the taxpayer’s previous resi-dence and the taxpayer’s status as a full- time employee in the new location. Special rules apply in the case of a member of the Armed Forces of the United States. In the case of any such individual who is on ac-tive duty, who moves pursuant to a military order and incident to a permanent change of station, the limitations related to distance from the taxpayer’s previous residence and status as a full-time employee in the new lo-cation do not apply.
235Additionally, any moving and storage expenses which are fur-nished in kind to such an individual, spouse, or dependents, or if such expenses are reim-bursed or an allowance for such expenses is provided, such amounts are excluded from gross income.
236Rules also apply to exclude amounts furnished to the spouse and depend-ents of such an individual in the event that such individuals move to a location other than to where the member of the Armed Forces is moving. Present law provides income exclusions for various benefits provided to members of the Armed Forces.
237 
HOUSE BILL  The House bill generally repeals the deduc-tion for moving expenses. The provision in-tends to retain tax benefits for the moving expenses of members of the Armed Forces of the United States.
238Thus, the provision re-tains the special rules under present law that provide an exclusion for amounts at-tributable to in-kind moving and storage ex-penses (and reimbursements or allowances for these expenses) for members of the Armed Forces (or their spouse or dependents) on active duty that move pursuant to a mili-tary order and incident to a permanent change of station.
239 Effective date.—The provision is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The Senate amendment generally suspends the deduction for moving expenses for tax-able years 2018 through 2025. However, during that suspension period, the provision retains the deduction for moving expenses and the rules providing for exclusions of amounts at-tributable to in-kind moving and storage ex-penses (and reimbursements or allowances for these expenses) for members of the Armed Forces (or their spouse or dependents) on active duty that move pursuant to a mili-tary order and incident to a permanent change of station. The suspension of the deduction for mov-ing expenses does not apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025. Effective date.—The provision is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the Sen-ate amendment. 10. Termination of deduction and exclusions for contributions to medical savings ac-counts (sec. 1311 of the House bill, secs. 106(b) and 220 of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  Archer MSAs As of 1997, certain individuals are per-mitted to contribute to an Archer MSA, which is a tax-exempt trust or custodial ac-count.
240Within limits, contributions to an Archer MSA are deductible in determining adjusted gross income if made by an indi-vidual and are excludible from gross income for income tax purposes and wages for em-ployment tax
241purposes if made by the em-ployer of an individual.
242 An individual is generally eligible for an Archer MSA if the individual is covered by a high deductible health plan and no other health plan other than a plan that provides certain permitted insurance or permitted coverage. In addition, the individual either must be an employee of a small employer (generally an employer with 50 or fewer em-ployees on average) that provides the high deductible health plan or must be self-em-ployed or the spouse of a self-employed indi-vidual and the high deductible health plan is not provided by the employer of the indi-vidual or spouse. For 2017, a high deductible health plan for purposes of Archer MSA eligibility is a health plan with an annual deductible of at least $2,250 and not more than $3,350 in the case of self-only coverage and at least $4,500 and not more than $6,750 in the case of fam-ily coverage. In addition, for 2017, the max-imum out-of-pocket expenses with respect to allowed costs must be no more than $4,500 in the case of self-only coverage and no more than $8,250 in the case of family coverage. Out-of-pocket expenses include deductibles, co-payments, and other amounts (other than premiums) that the individual must pay for covered benefits under the plan. A plan does not fail to qualify as a high deductible health plan if substantially all of the cov-erage under the plan is certain permitted in-surance or is coverage (whether provided through insurance or otherwise) for acci-dents, disability, dental care, vision care, or long-term care. The maximum annual contribution that can be made to an Archer MSA for a year is 65 percent of the annual deductible under the individual’s high deductible health plan in the case of self-only coverage (65 percent of $3,350 for 2017) and 75 percent of the annual deductible in the case of family coverage (75 percent of $6,750 for 2017), but in no case more than the individual’s compensation in-come. In addition, the maximum contribu-tion can be made only if the individual is covered by the high deductible health plan for the full year. Distributions from an Archer MSA for qualified medical expenses are not includible in gross income. Distributions not used for qualified medical expenses are includible in gross income and subject to an additional 20- percent tax unless an exception applies. A distribution from an Archer MSA may be rolled over on a nontaxable basis to another Archer MSA or to a health savings account and does not count against the contribution limits. After 2007, no new contributions can be made to Archer MSAs except by or on behalf

243The FICA exclusion is provided under IRS No-tice 2004–2. 
244Secs. 106(d) and 223. 245Secs. 62(a)(1) and 67. 
246Sec. 62(a)(2)(B), (C), and (D). Under section 62(a)(2)(A) and (C), certain reimbursements of em-ployee business expenses are excluded from income. Under section 62(a)(2)(E), an above-the-line deduc-tion applies to expenses of members of a reserve component of the Armed Forces. 
247Sec. 62(d)(1). 
248The provision retains the present-law provisions under which certain reimbursements of employee business expenses are excluded from income and under which an above-the-line deduction applies to expenses of members of a reserve component of the Armed Forces. 
249Sec. 11045 of the Senate amendment. 250Section 132(a)(5) and 132(f)(1)(D). 
251Sec. 119(a). 
252Sec. 119(c). 
253Sec. 119(d). 
254The compensation threshold is that amount in effect under section 414(q)(1)(B)(i). 
255As defined in section 416(i)(1)(B)(i). of individuals who previously had made Ar-cher MSA contributions and employees of small employers that previously contributed to Archer MSAs (or at least 20 percent of whose employees who were previously eligi-ble to contribute to Archer MSAs did so). Health savings accounts As of 2004, an individual with a high de-ductible health plan (and no other health plan other than a plan that provides certain permitted insurance or permitted coverage) generally may contribute to a health savings account (‘‘HSA’’), which is a tax-exempt trust or custodial account. HSAs provide similar tax-favored savings treatment as Ar-cher MSAs. That is, within limits, contribu-tions to an HSA are deductible in deter-mining adjusted gross income if made by an individual and are excludable from gross in-come for income tax purposes and wages for employment tax
243purposes if made by the employer of an individual, and distributions for qualified medical expenses are not in-cludible in gross income.
244However, the rules for HSAs are in various aspects more favorable than the rules for Archer MSAs. For example, the availability of HSAs is not limited to employees of small employers or self-employed individuals and their spouses. For 2017, a high deductible health plan for purposes of HSA eligibility is a health plan with an annual deductible of at least $1,300 in the case of self-only coverage and at least $2,600 in the case of family coverage. In addi-tion, for 2017, the sum of the deductible and the maximum out-of-pocket expenses with respect to allowed costs must be no more than $6,550 in the case of self-only coverage and no more than $13,100 in the case of fam-ily coverage. A plan does not fail to qualify as a high deductible health plan for HSA pur-poses merely because it does not have a de-ductible for preventive care. For 2017, the maximum aggregate annual contribution that can be made to an HSA is $3,400 in the case of self-only coverage and $6,750 in the case of family coverage. The an-nual contribution limits are increased by $1,000 for individuals who have attained age 55 by the end of the taxable year (referred to as ‘‘catch-up contributions’’). The maximum amount that an individual make contribute is reduced by the amount of any contribu-tions to the individual’s Archer MSA and any excludable HSA contributions made by the individual’s employer. In some cases, an individual may make the maximum HSA contribution, even if the individual is cov-ered by the high deductible health plan for only part of the year. A distribution from an HSA may be rolled over on a nontaxable basis to another HSA and does not count against the contribution limits. 
HOUSE BILL  Under the provision, contributions to Ar-cher MSAs for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, are not deductible or ex-cludible from gross income and wages. Effective date.—The provision is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  No provision. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement does not contain the House bill provision. 11. Denial of deduction for performing artists and certain officials; Modification of de-duction for educator expenses (sec. 1312 of the House bill, sec. 11032 of the Senate amendment and sec. 62 of the Code) PRESENT LAW  In general, unreimbursed business expenses incurred by an employee are deductible, but only as an itemized deduction and only to the extent the expenses exceed two percent of adjusted gross income.
245However, in the case of certain employees and certain ex-penses, a deduction may be taken in deter-mining adjusted gross income (referred to as an ‘‘above-the-line’’ deduction), including ex-penses of qualified performing artists, ex-penses of State or local government officials performing services on a fee basis, and ex-penses of eligible educators.
246 Eligible educators are elementary or sec-ondary school teachers, instructors, coun-selors, principals, or aides in a school for at least 900 hours during a school year.
247An el- igible educator may take an ‘‘above-the- line’’ deduction for ordinary and necessary expenses incurred (1) by reason of participa-tion in professional development courses re-lated to the curriculum or students the edu-cator teaches, or (2) in connection with books, supplies, computer and other equip-ment, and supplementary materials to be used in the classroom. The deduction may not exceed $250 (for 2017) in expenses, and is indexed for inflation. 
HOUSE BILL  The House bill repeals the present-law pro-visions allowing for above-the-line deduc-tions for expenses of qualified performing artists, expenses of State or local govern-ment officials performing services on a fee basis, and expenses of eligible educators.
248 Effective date.—The provision is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The Senate amendment temporarily in-creases the limit for the deduction of certain expenses of eligible educators, in deter-mining adjusted gross income, to $500. Any deduction for expenses in excess of this amount (under present law generally a mis-cellaneous itemized deduction subject to the two-percent floor) is suspended.
249 The provision does not apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025. Effective date.—The provision is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement does not include the House bill provision or the Senate amendment provision and retains the present-law above-the-line deduction and limit for certain expenses of eligible edu-cators. 12. Suspension of exclusion for qualified bicy-cle commuting reimbursement (sec. 11048 of the Senate amendment and secs. 132(f) of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  Qualified bicycle commuting reimburse-ments of up to $20 per qualifying bicycle commuting month are excludible from an employee’s gross income250. A qualifying bi-cycle commuting month is any month during which the employee regularly uses the bicy-cle for a substantial portion of travel to a place of employment and during which the employee does not receive transportation in a commuter highway vehicle, a transit pass, or qualified parking from an employer. Qualified reimbursements are any amount received from an employer during a 15- month period beginning with the first day of the calendar year as payment for reasonable expenses during a calendar year. Reasonable expenses are those incurred in a calendar year for the purchase of a bicycle and bicycle improvements, repair, and storage, if the bi-cycle is regularly used for travel between the employee’s residence and place of employ-ment. Amounts that are excludible from gross in-come for income tax purposes are also ex-cluded from wages for employment tax pur-poses. 
HOUSE BILL  No provision. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The provision suspends the exclusion from gross income and wages for qualified bicycle commuting reimbursements. The exclusion does not apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026. Effective date.—The provision is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the Sen-ate amendment. 13. Limitation on exclusion for employer-pro-vided housing (sec. 1401 of the House bill and sec. 119 of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  The value of lodging furnished to an em-ployee, spouse, or dependents by or on behalf of an employer for the convenience of the employer (referred to as ‘‘employer-provided lodging’’) is excludible from the employee’s gross income, but only if the employee is re-quired to accept the lodging on the business premises of the employer as a condition of employment.
251Special rules apply with re-spect to employees living in foreign camps
252 and lodging furnished by certain educational institutions to employees.
253Amounts at-tributable to employer-provided lodging that are excludible from gross income for income tax purposes are also excluded from wages for employment tax purposes. 
HOUSE BILL  The provision limits the amount that may be excluded from gross income for employer- provided lodging to $50,000 ($25,000 in the case of a married individual filing a separate re-turn), subject to a phase-out based on the employee’s level of compensation. The exclu-sion is phased out by $1 for every $2 earned above the indexed compensation threshold. For 2017, this compensation threshold is $120,000.
254The provision also denies any ex-clusion for employer-provided housing pro-vided to 5% owners,
255regardless of their compensation level. In addition, the exclusion does not apply to more than one residence at any given time. In the case of spouses filing a joint return, the one residence limit may be applied sepa-rately to each spouse for a period during

256Sec. 129(a). 
257Section 129(d). The exclusion applies if the con-tributions or benefits under the program do not dis-criminate in favor of highly compensated employ-ees, within the meaning of Sec. 414(q), or their de-pendents, and the program benefits employees under a classification established by the employer found not to be discriminatory in favor or such highly compensated employees or their dependents. 
258Secs. 132(a)(6) and 132(g). 
259Individuals are allowed an itemized deduction for moving expenses paid or incurred during the tax-able year in connection with the commencement of work by the taxpayer as an employee or as a self- employed individual at a new principal place of work.
259Such expenses are deductible only if the move meets certain conditions related to distance from the taxpayer’s previous residence and the tax-payer’s status as a full-time employee in the new lo-cation. 260Sec. 137(a). 
261Sec. 23(d)(1). 
262The employer’s adoption assistance program must not discriminate in favor of highly com-pensated employees, within the meaning of Sec. 414(q). In addition, no more than five percent of the amounts paid or incurred by the employer during the year for qualified adoption expenses under an adoption assistance program can be provided for the class of individuals consisting of more-than-five-per-cent owners of the employer and the spouses or de-pendents of such more-than-five-percent owners. which the spouses reside in separate resi-dences provided in connection with their re-spective employments. Those amounts that are not excludible from gross income for income tax purposes will also not be excluded from wages for em-ployment tax purposes. Effective date.—The provision is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  No provision. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement does not include the House bill provision. 14. Modification of exclusion of gain on sale of a principal residence (sec. 1402 of the House bill, sec. 11047 of the Senate amendment, and sec. 121 of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  A taxpayer who is an individual may ex-clude up to $250,000 ($500,000 if married filing a joint return) of gain realized on the sale or exchange of a principal residence. To be eli-gible for the exclusion, the taxpayer must have owned and used the residence as a prin-cipal residence for at least two of the five years ending on the date of the sale or ex-change. A taxpayer who fails to meet these requirements by reason of a change of place of employment, health, or, to the extent pro-vided under regulations, unforeseen cir-cumstances, is able to exclude an amount equal to the fraction of the $250,000 ($500,000 if married filing a joint return) that is equal to the fraction of the two years that the ownership and use requirements are met. The exclusion under this provision may not be claimed for more than one sale or ex-change during any two-year period. 
HOUSE BILL  The provision extends the length of time a taxpayer must own and use a residence to qualify for this exclusion. Specifically, the exclusion is available only if the taxpayer has owned and used the residence as a prin-cipal residence for at least five of the eight years ending on the date of the sale or ex-change. A taxpayer who fails to meet these requirements by reason of a change of place of employment, health, or, to the extent pro-vided under regulations, unforeseen cir-cumstances is able to exclude an amount equal to the fraction of the $250,000 ($500,000 if married filing a joint return) that is equal to the fraction of the five years that the ownership and use requirements are met. The provision limits the exclusion so that the exclusion may not apply to more than one sale or exchange during any five-year pe-riod. The provision phases-out the exclusion by one dollar for every dollar a taxpayer’s AGI exceeds $250,000 ($500,000 if married filing a joint return). For purposes of this provision, AGI is measured using the average of the taxpayer’s AGI in the year of sale (excluding any income from the sale of the home) and the prior two taxable years before the sale. Effective date.—The provision is effective for sales and exchanges after December 31, 2017. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The Senate amendment generally follows the House bill, but does not include the pro-vision that phases out the exclusion for AGI in excess of $250,000 ($500,000 if married filing a joint return). The Senate amendment does not apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025. Effective date.—The provision is effective for sales and exchanges after December 31, 2017. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  No provision. 15. Sunset of exclusion for dependent care as-sistance programs (sec. 1404 of the House bill and sec. 129 of the Code) PRESENT LAW  An exclusion from the gross income of an employee of up to $5,000 annually for em-ployer-provided dependent care assistance
256 is allowed if the assistance is provided pursu-ant to a separate written plan of an em-ployer that does not discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees
257and meets certain other requirements. The amount ex-cludible cannot exceed the earned income of the employee or, if the employee is married, the lesser of the earned income of the em-ployee or the earned income of the employ-ee’s spouse. Amounts attributable to depend-ent care assistance that are excludible from gross income for income tax purposes are also excludible from wages for employment tax purposes. 
HOUSE BILL  The provision repeals the deduction for qualified tuition and related expenses. Effective date.—The provision terminates the exclusions from gross income and wages for dependent care assistance programs for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2022. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  No provision. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement does not include the House bill provision. 16. Repeal of exclusion for qualified moving expense reimbursement (sec. 1405 of the House bill, sec. 11049 of the Senate amendment, and sec. 132(g) of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  Qualified moving expense reimbursements are excluded from an employee’s gross in-come,
258and are defined as any amount re-ceived (directly or indirectly) from an em-ployer as payment for (or reimbursement of) expenses which would be deductible as mov-ing expenses under section 217
259if directly paid or incurred by the employee. However, any such amount actually deducted by the individual is not eligible for this exclusion. Amounts that are excludible from gross in-come for income tax purposes are also ex-cluded from wages for employment tax pur-poses. 
HOUSE BILL  The provision repeals the exclusion from gross income and wages for qualified moving expense reimbursements except in the case of a member of the Armed Forces of the United States on active duty who moves pur-suant to a military order. Effective date.—The provision is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The Senate amendment is the same as the House bill except that the exclusion does not apply to taxable years beginning after De-cember 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026. Effective date.—The provision is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the Sen-ate amendment. 17. Repeal of exclusion for adoption assist-ance programs (sec. 1406 of the House bill and sec. 137 of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  An exclusion from an employee’s gross in-come is allowed for qualified adoption ex-penses paid or reimbursed by an employer, if such amounts are furnished pursuant to an adoption assistance program.
260For 2017, the maximum exclusion amount is $13,570, and is phased out ratably for taxpayers with modi-fied adjusted gross income (‘‘AGI’’) above a certain amount. In 2017, the phase out range begins at modified AGI of $203,540, with no exclusion when modified AGI equals or ex-ceeds $243,540. Modified AGI is the sum of the taxpayer’s AGI plus amounts excluded from income under sections 911, 931, and 933 (relat-ing to the exclusion of income of U.S. citi-zens or residents living abroad; residents of Guam, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands and residents of Puerto Rico, respectively). In the case of adoption of a child with spe-cial needs that is finalized during a taxable year, the taxpayer may claim as an exclu-sion the amount of the maximum exclusion minus the aggregate qualified adoption ex-penses with respect to that adoption for all prior taxable years. Qualified adoption expenses are reasonable and necessary adoption fees, court costs, at-torney fees, and other expenses that are: (1) directly related to, and the principal purpose of which is for, the legal adoption of an eligi-ble child by the taxpayer; (2) not incurred in violation of State or Federal law, or in car-rying out any surrogate parenting arrange-ment; (3) not for the adoption of the child of the taxpayer’s spouse; and (4) not reimbursed (e.g., by an employer).
261 For the exclusion to apply, certain require-ments must be satisfied, including satisfac-tion of nondiscrimination rules and pro-viding employees with reasonable notifica-tion of the availability and terms of the pro-gram.
262 Adoption expenses paid or reimbursed by the employer under an adoption assistance program are not eligible for the adoption credit under section 23. A taxpayer may be eligible for the adoption credit (with respect to qualified adoption expenses he or she in-curs) and also for the exclusion (with respect to different qualified adoption expenses paid or reimbursed by his or her employer). 
HOUSE BILL  The provision repeals the exclusion from gross income for adoption assistance pro-grams. Effective date.—The provision is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017.

270Subject to various exceptions, distributions from an IRA before age 59
1⁄2that are includible in in-come are subject to a 10-percent early distribution tax under section 72(t). An exception applies to an amount includible in income as a result of the con-version from a traditional IRA into a Roth IRA. However, the early distribution tax applies if the taxpayer withdraws the amount within five years of the conversion.

272As in the case of a conversion of an amount from a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA, the special re-capture rule relating to the 10-percent additional tax on early distributions applies for distributions made from the Roth IRA within a specified five-year period after the rollover.

276The provision does not preclude an individual from making a contribution to a traditional IRA and converting the traditional IRA to a Roth IRA. Rather, the provision would preclude the individual from later unwinding the conversion through a re-characterization. CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement does not include the House bill provision. E. Simplification and Reform of Savings, Pensions, Retirement 1. Repeal of special rule permitting re-characterization of IRA contributions (sec. 1501 of the House bill, sec. 13611 of the Senate amendment, and sec. 408A of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  Individual retirement arrangements There are two basic types of individual re-tirement arrangements (‘‘IRAs’’) under present law: traditional IRAs,
263to which both deductible and nondeductible contribu-tions may be made,
264and Roth IRAs, to which only nondeductible contributions may be made.
265The principal difference between these two types of IRAs is the timing of in-come tax inclusion. An annual limit applies to contributions to IRAs. The contribution limit is coordinated so that the aggregate maximum amount that can be contributed to all of an individual’s IRAs (both traditional and Roth) for a tax-able year is the lesser of a certain dollar amount ($5,500 for 2017) or the individual’s compensation. In the case of a married cou-ple, contributions can be made up to the dol-lar limit for each spouse if the combined compensation of the spouses is at least equal to the contributed amount. The dollar limit is increased annually (‘‘indexed’’) as needed to reflect increases in the cost-of living. An individual who has attained age 50 before the end of the taxable year may also make catch-up contributions up to $1,000 to an IRA. The IRA catch-up contribution limit is not indexed. Traditional IRAs An individual may make deductible con-tributions to a traditional IRA up to the IRA contribution limit (reduced by any contribu-tions to Roth IRAs) if neither the individual nor the individual’s spouse is an active par-ticipant in an employer-sponsored retire-ment plan. If an individual (or the individ-ual’s spouse) is an active participant in an employer-sponsored retirement plan, the de-duction is phased out for taxpayers with ad-justed gross income (‘‘AGI’’) for the taxable year over certain indexed levels.
266To the ex- tent an individual cannot or does not make deductible contributions to a traditional IRA or contributions to a Roth IRA for the tax-able year, the individual may make non-deductible after-tax contributions to a tradi-tional IRA (that is, no AGI limits apply), subject to the same contribution limits as the limits on deductible contributions, in-cluding catch-up contributions. An indi-vidual who has attained age 70
1⁄2before to the close of a year is not permitted to make contributions to a traditional IRA for that year. Amounts held in a traditional IRA are in-cludible in income when withdrawn, except to the extent the withdrawal is a return of the individual’s basis.
267All traditional IRAs of an individual are treated as a single con-tract for purposes of recovering basis in the IRAs. Roth IRAs Individuals with AGI below certain levels may make nondeductible contributions to a Roth IRA. The maximum annual contribu-tion that can be made to a Roth IRA is phased out for taxpayers with AGI for the taxable year over certain indexed levels.268 Amounts held in a Roth IRA that are with-drawn as a qualified distribution are not in-cludible in income. A qualified distribution is a distribution that (1) is made after the five-taxable-year period beginning with the first taxable year for which the individual first made a contribution to a Roth IRA, and (2) is made after attainment of age 59
1⁄2, on account of death or disability, or is made for first-time homebuyer expenses of up to $10,000. Distributions from a Roth IRA that are not qualified distributions are includible in in-come to the extent attributable to earnings; amounts that are attributable to a return of contributions to the Roth IRA are not in-cludible in income. All Roth IRAs are treat-ed as a single contract for purposes of deter-mining the amount that is a return of con-tributions. Separation of traditional and Roth IRA ac-counts Contributions to traditional IRAs and to Roth IRAs must be segregated into separate IRAs, meaning arrangements with separate trusts, accounts, or contracts, and separate IRA documents. Except in the case of a con-version or recharacterization, amounts can-not be transferred or rolled over between the two types of IRAs. Taxpayers generally may convert an amount in a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA.
269The amount converted is includible in the taxpayer’s income as if a withdrawal had been made.
270The conversion is accom-plished by a trustee-to-trustee transfer of the amount from the traditional IRA to the Roth IRA, or by a distribution from the tra-ditional IRA and contribution to the Roth IRA within 60 days. Rollovers to IRAs of distributions from tax-favored employer-sponsored retirement plans (that is, qualified retirement plans, tax-deferred annuity plans, and govern-mental eligible deferred compensation plans
271) are also permitted. For tax-free rollovers, distributions from pretax accounts under an employer-sponsored plan generally must are contributed to a traditional IRA, and distributions from a designated Roth ac-count under an employer-sponsored plan must be contributed only to a Roth IRA. However, a distribution from an employer- sponsored plan that is not from a designated Roth account is also permitted to be rolled over into a Roth IRA, subject to the rules that apply to conversions from a traditional IRA into a Roth IRA. Thus, a rollover from a tax-favored employer-sponsored plan to a Roth IRA is includible in gross income (ex-cept to the extent it represents a return of after-tax contributions).
272 Recharacterization of IRA contributions If an individual makes a contribution to an IRA (traditional or Roth) for a taxable year, the individual is permitted to recharacterize the contribution as a contribution to the other type of IRA (traditional or Roth) by making a trustee-to-trustee transfer to the other type of IRA before the due date for the individual’s income tax return for that year.273In the case of a recharacterization, the contribution will be treated as having been made to the transferee IRA (and not the original, transferor IRA) as of the date of the original contribution. Both regular contribu-tions and conversion contributions to a Roth IRA can be recharacterized as having been made to a traditional IRA. The amount transferred in a recharacter-ization must be accompanied by any net in-come allocable to the contribution. In gen-eral, even if a recharacterization is accom-plished by transferring a specific asset, net income is calculated as a pro rata portion of income on the entire account rather than in-come allocable to the specific asset trans-ferred. However, when doing a Roth conver-sion of an amount for a year, an individual may establish multiple Roth IRAs, for exam-ple, Roth IRAs with different investment strategies, and divide the amount being con-verted among the IRAs. The individual can then choose whether to recharacterize any of the Roth IRAs as a traditional IRA by trans-ferring the entire amount in the particular Roth IRA to a traditional IRA.
274For exam- ple, if the value of the assets in a particular Roth IRA declines after the conversion, the conversion can be reversed by recharacter-izing that IRA as a traditional IRA. The in-dividual may then later convert that tradi-tional IRA to a Roth IRA (referred to as a re-conversion), including only the lower value in income. Treasury regulations prevent the reconversion from taking place immediately after the recharcterization, by requiring a minimum period to elapse before the recon-version. Generally the reconversion cannot occur sooner than the later of 30 days after the recharacterization or a date during the taxable year following the taxable year of the original conversion.
275 
HOUSE BILL  The House bill repeals the special rule that allows IRA contributions to one type of IRA (either traditional or Roth) to be re-characterized as a contribution to the other type of IRA. Thus, for example, under the provision, a conversion contribution estab-lishing a Roth IRA during a taxable year can no longer be recharacterized as a contribu-tion to a traditional IRA (thereby unwinding the conversion).
276 Effective date.—The provision is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017.

289Certain distributions are not eligible rollover distributions, such as annuity payments, required Continued apply to a conversion contribution to a Roth IRA. Thus, recharacterization cannot be used to unwind a Roth conversion. However, recharacterization is still permitted with re-spect to other contributions. For example, an individual may make a contribution for a year to a Roth IRA and, before the due date for the individual’s income tax return for that year, recharacterize it as a contribution to a traditional IRA.
277 Effective date.—The provision is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 2. Reduction in minimum age for allowable in-service distributions (sec. 1502 of the House bill and secs. 401 and 457 of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  Tax-favored employer-sponsored retire-ment plans consist of qualified retirement plans, including certain defined contribution plans that allow employees to make elective deferrals (a ‘‘section 401(k) plan’’), tax-de-ferred annuity plans (a ‘‘section 403(b) plan’’), which may also allow employees to make elective deferrals, and eligible deferred compensation plans of State and local gov-ernment employers (a ‘‘governmental sec-tion 457(b) plan’’).
278The terms of an em-ployer-sponsored retirement plan generally determine when distributions are permitted. However, in some cases, restrictions may apply to distribution before an employee’s severance from employment, referred to as ‘‘in-service’’ distributions. In-service distributions of elective defer-rals (and related earnings) under a section 401(k) plan generally are permitted only after attainment of age 59
1⁄2or termination of the plan.
279In-service distributions of elective deferrals (but not related earnings) are also permitted in the case of hardship. Elective deferrals under a section 403(b) plan are subject to in-service distribution restric-tions similar to those applicable to elective deferrals under a section 401(k) plan, and, in some cases, other contributions to a section 403(b) plan are subject to similar restric-tions.
280 Pension plans, that is, qualified defined benefit plans and money purchase pension plans, a type of qualified defined contribu-tion plan, generally may not permit in-serv-ice distributions before attainment of age 62 (or attainment of normal retirement age under the plan if earlier) or termination of the plan.
281 Deferrals under a governmental section 457(b) plan are subject to in-service distribu-tion restrictions similar to those applicable to elective deferrals under a section 401(k) plan, except that in-service distributions under a governmental section 457(b) plan are permitted only after attainment of age 70
1⁄2 (rather than age 59
1⁄2).282 
HOUSE BILL  Under the House bill, in-service distribu-tions are permitted under a pension plan or a governmental section 457(b) plan at age 59
1⁄2, thus making the rules for those plans consistent with the rules for section 401(k) plans and section 403(b) plans. Effective date.—The provision is effective for plan years beginning after December 31, 2017. SENATE AMENDMENT  No provision. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement does not include the House bill provision. 3. Modification of rules governing hardship distributions (sec. 1503 of the House bill and secs. 401 and 403 of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  Elective deferrals under a section 401(k) plan or a section 403(b) plan may not be dis-tributed before the occurrence of one or more specified events, including financial hardship of the employee.
283 Applicable Treasury regulations provide that a distribution is made on account of hardship only if the distribution is made on account of an immediate and heavy financial need of the employee and is necessary to sat-isfy the heavy need.
284The Treasury regula-tions provide a safe harbor under which a distribution may be deemed necessary to sat-isfy an immediate and heavy financial need. One requirement of this safe harbor is that the employee be prohibited from making elective deferrals and employee contribu-tions to the plan and all other plans main-tained by the employer for at least six months after receipt of the hardship dis-tribution. 
HOUSE BILL  Under the House bill, the Secretary of the Treasury is directed to modify the applicable regulations within one year of the date of en-actment to (1) delete the requirement that an employee be prohibited from making elec-tive deferrals and employee contributions for six months after the receipt of a hardship distribution in order for the distribution to be deemed necessary to satisfy an immediate and heavy financial need, and (2) make any other modifications necessary to carry out the purposes of the rule allowing elective de-ferrals to be distributed in the case of hard-ship. Thus, under the modified regulations, an employee would not be prevented for any period after the receipt of a hardship dis-tribution from continuing to make elective deferrals and employee contributions. Effective date.—The regulations as revised by the provision shall apply to plan years be-ginning after December 31, 2017. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  No provision. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement does not include the House bill provision. 4. Modification of rules relating to hardship withdrawals from cash or deferred ar-rangements (sec. 1504 of the bill, sec. 11033(c) of the Senate amendment, and sec. 401 of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  Amounts attributable to elective deferrals (including earnings thereon) under a section 401(k) plan generally may not be distributed before the earliest of the employee’s sever-ance from employment, death, disability or attainment of age 59
1⁄2, or termination of the plan, or as a qualified reservist distribu-tion.
285Elective deferrals, but not associated earnings, may be distributed on account of hardship. An employer may make nonelective and matching contributions for employees under a section 401(k) plan. Elective deferrals, and matching contributions and after-tax em-ployee contributions, are subject to special tests (‘‘nondiscrimination tests’’) to prevent discrimination in favor of highly com-pensated employees. Nonelective contribu-tions and matching contributions that sat-isfy certain requirements (‘‘qualified non-elective contributions and qualified match-ing contributions’’) may be used to enable the plan to satisfy these nondiscrimination tests. One of the requirements is that these contributions be subject to the same dis-tribution restrictions as elective deferrals, except that these contributions (and associ-ated earnings) are not permitted to be dis-tributed on account of hardship. Applicable Treasury regulations provide that a distribution is made on account of hardship only if the distribution is made on account of an immediate and heavy financial need of the employee and is necessary to sat-isfy the heavy need.286The Treasury regula-tions provide a safe harbor under which a distribution may be deemed necessary to sat-isfy an immediate and heavy financial need. One requirement of the safe harbor is that the employee represent that the need cannot be satisfied through currently available plan loans. This in effect requires an employee to take any available plan loan before receiving a hardship distribution. 
HOUSE BILL  The House bill allows earnings on elective deferrals under a section 401(k) plan, as well as qualified nonelective contributions and qualified matching contributions (and asso-ciated earnings), to be distributed on ac-count of hardship. Further, a distribution is not treated as failing to be on account of hardship solely because the employee does not take any available plan loan. Effective date.—The provision is effective for plan years beginning after December 31, 2017. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The Senate amendment is the same as the House bill. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement does not include the House bill provision or Senate amend-ment. 5. Extended rollover period for the rollover of plan loan offset amounts in certain cases (sec. 1505 of the bill, sec. 13613 of the Senate amendment, and sec. 402 of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  Taxation of retirement plan distributions A distribution from a tax-favored em-ployer-sponsored retirement plan (that is, a qualified retirement plan, section 403(b) plan, or a governmental section 457(b) plan) is generally includible in gross income, ex-cept in the case of a qualified distribution from a designated Roth account or to the ex-tent the distribution is a recovery of basis under the plan or the distribution is contrib-uted to another such plan or an IRA (referred to as eligible retirement plans) in a tax-free rollover.
287In the case of a distribution from a retirement plan to an employee under age 59
1⁄2, the distribution (other than a distribu-tion from a governmental section 457(b) plan) is also subject to a 10-percent early dis-tribution tax unless an exception applies.
288 A distribution from a tax-favored em-ployer-sponsored retirement plan that is an eligible rollover distribution may be rolled over to an eligible retirement plan.

291Sec. 72(p). 292Secs. 401(a)(3)–(5) and 410(b). Detailed rules are provided in Treas. Reg. secs. 1.401(a)(4)–1 through –13 and secs. 1.410(b)–2 through –10. In applying the non-discrimination requirements, certain employees, such as those under age 21 or with less than a year of service, generally may be disregarded. In addi-tion, employees of controlled groups and affiliated service groups under the aggregation rules of sec-tion 414(b), (c), (m) and (o) are treated as employed by a single employer. 
293Sec. 401(a)(26). 
294Sec. 414(q). At the election of the employer, em-ployees who are highly compensated based on the amount of their compensation may be limited to employees who were among the top 20 percent of em-ployees based on compensation. 295Elective deferrals are contributions that an em-ployee elects to have made to a defined contribution plan that includes a qualified cash or deferred ar-rangement (referred to as ‘‘section 401(k) plan’’) rather than receive the same amount as current compensation. Employer matching contributions are contributions made by an employer only if an employee makes elective deferrals or after-tax em-ployee contributions. Employer nonelective con-tributions are contributions made by an employer regardless of whether an employee makes elective deferrals or after-tax employee contributions. Under section 4975(e)(7), an ESOP is a defined contribution plan, or portion of a defined contribution plan, that is designated as an ESOP and is designed to invest primarily in employer stock. 
296Contribution and benefit rates are generally de-termined under the rules for nondiscriminatory con-tributions or benefit accruals, described below. These rules are generally based on benefit accruals under a defined benefit plan, other than accruals at-tributable to after-tax employee contributions, and contributions allocated to participants’ accounts under a defined contribution plan, other than alloca-tions attributable to after-tax employee contribu-tions. (Under these rules, contributions allocated to a participants accounts are referred to as ‘‘alloca-tions,’’ with the related rates referred to as ‘‘alloca-tion rates,’’ but ‘‘contribution rates’’ is used herein for convenience.) However, as discussed below, ben-efit accruals can be converted to actuarially equiva-lent contributions, and contributions can be con-verted to actuarially equivalent benefit accruals. rollover generally can be achieved by direct rollover (direct payment from the distrib-uting plan to the recipient plan) or by con-tributing the distribution to the eligible re-tirement plan within 60 days of receiving the distribution (‘‘60-day rollover’’). Employer-sponsored retirement plans are required to offer an employee a direct roll-over with respect to any eligible rollover dis-tribution before paying the amount to the employee. If an eligible rollover distribution is not directly rolled over to an eligible re-tirement plan, the taxable portion of the dis-tribution generally is subject to mandatory 20-percent income tax withholding.
290Em- ployees who do not elect a direct rollover but who roll over eligible distributions within 60 days of receipt also defer tax on the rollover amounts; however, the 20 percent withheld will remain taxable unless the employee sub-stitutes funds within the 60-day period. Plan loans Employer-sponsored retirement plans may provide loans to employees. Unless the loan satisfies certain requirements in both form and operation, the amount of a retirement plan loan is a deemed distribution from the retirement plan, including that the terms of the loan provide for a repayment period of not more than five years (except for a loan specifically to purchase a home) and for level amortization of loan payments with pay-ments not less frequently than quarterly.
291 Thus, if an employee stops making payments on a loan before the loan is repaid, a deemed distribution of the outstanding loan balance generally occurs. A deemed distribution of an unpaid loan balance is generally taxed as though an actual distribution occurred, in-cluding being subject to a 10-percent early distribution tax, if applicable. A deemed dis-tribution is not eligible for rollover to an-other eligible retirement plan. A plan may also provide that, in certain circumstances (for example, if an employee terminates employment), an employee’s obli-gation to repay a loan is accelerated and, if the loan is not repaid, the loan is cancelled and the amount in employee’s account bal-ance is offset by the amount of the unpaid loan balance, referred to as a loan offset. A loan offset is treated as an actual distribu-tion from the plan equal to the unpaid loan balance (rather than a deemed distribution), and (unlike a deemed distribution) the amount of the distribution is eligible for tax- free rollover to another eligible retirement plan within 60 days. However, the plan is not required to offer a direct rollover with re-spect to a plan loan offset amount that is an eligible rollover distribution, and the plan loan offset amount is generally not subject to 20-percent income tax withholding. 
HOUSE BILL  Under the House bill, the period during which a qualified plan loan offset amount may be contributed to an eligible retirement plan as a rollover contribution is extended from 60 days after the date of the offset to the due date (including extensions) for filing the Federal income tax return for the tax-able year in which the plan loan offset oc-curs, that is, the taxable year in which the amount is treated as distributed from the plan. Under the provision, a qualified plan loan offset amount is a plan loan offset amount that is treated as distributed from a qualified retirement plan, a section 403(b) plan or a governmental section 457(b) plan solely by reason of the termination of the plan or the failure to meet the repayment terms of the loan because of the employee’s separation from service, whether due to lay-off, cessation of business, termination of em-ployment, or otherwise. As under present law, a loan offset amount under the provi-sion is the amount by which an employee’s account balance under the plan is reduced to repay a loan from the plan. Effective date.—The provision is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. SENATE AMENDMENT  The Senate amendment is the same as the House bill, except that a qualified plan loan offset amount is a plan loan offset amount that is treated as distributed from a quali-fied retirement plan, a section 403(b) plan or a governmental section 457(b) plan solely by reason of the termination of the plan or the failure to meet the repayment terms of the loan because of the employee’s severance from employment. Effective date.—The provision is effective for plan loan offset amounts treated as dis-tributed in taxable years beginning after De-cember 31, 2017. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the Sen-ate amendment. 6. Modification of nondiscrimination rules for certain plans providing benefits or con-tributions to older, longer service partici-pants (sec. 1506 of the House bill and sec. 401 of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  In general Qualified retirement plans are subject to nondiscrimination requirements, under which the group of employees covered by a plan (‘‘plan coverage’’) and the contributions or benefits provided to employees, including benefits, rights, and features under the plan, must not discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees.
292The timing of plan amendments must also not have the ef-fect of discriminating significantly in favor of highly compensated employees. In addi-tion, in the case of a defined benefit plan, the plan must benefit at least the lesser of (1) 50 employees and (2) the greater of 40 percent of all employees and two employees (or one em-ployee if the employer has only one em-ployee), referred to as the ‘‘minimum par-ticipation’’ requirements.
293 These non-discrimination requirements are designed to help ensure that qualified retirement plans achieve the goal of retirement security for both lower and higher paid employees. For nondiscrimination purposes, an em-ployee generally is treated as highly com-pensated if the employee (1) was a five-per-cent owner of the employer at any time dur-ing the year or the preceding year, or (2) had compensation for the preceding year in ex-cess of $120,000 (for 2017).
294Employees who are not highly compensated are referred to as nonhighly compensated employees. Nondiscriminatory plan coverage Whether plan coverage of employees is nondiscriminatory is determined by calcu-lating a plan’s ratio percentage, that is, the ratio of the percentage of nonhighly com-pensated employees covered under the plan to the percentage of highly compensated em-ployees covered. For this purpose, certain portions of a defined contribution plan are treated as separate plans to which the plan coverage requirements are applied sepa-rately, referred to as mandatory disaggregation. Specifically, the following, if provided under a plan, are treated as sepa-rate plans: the portion of a plan consisting of employee elective deferrals, the portion con-sisting of employer matching contributions, the portion consisting of employer nonelec-tive contributions, and the portion con-sisting of an employee stock ownership plan (‘‘ESOP’’).295 Subject to mandatory disaggregation, different qualified retire-ment plans may otherwise be aggregated and tested together as a single plan, provided that they use the same plan year. The plan determined under these rules for plan cov-erage purposes generally is also treated as the plan for purposes of applying the other nondiscrimination requirements. A plan’s coverage is nondiscriminatory if the ratio percentage, as determined above, is 70 percent or greater. If a plan’s ratio per-centage is less than 70 percent, a multi-part test applies, referred to as the average ben-efit test. First, the plan must meet a ‘‘non-discriminatory classification requirement,’’ that is, it must cover a group of employees that is reasonable and established under ob-jective business criteria and the plan’s ratio percentage must be at or above a level speci-fied in the regulations, which varies depend-ing on the percentage of nonhighly com-pensated employees in the employer’s work-force. In addition, the average benefit per-centage test must be satisfied. Under the average benefit percentage test, in general, the average rate of employer-pro-vided contributions or benefit accruals for all nonhighly compensated employees under all plans of the employer must be at least 70 percent of the average contribution or ac-crual rate of all highly compensated employ-ees.
296In applying the average benefit per-centage test, elective deferrals made by em-ployees, as well as employer matching and nonelective contributions, are taken into ac-count. Generally, all plans maintained by the employer are taken into account, includ-ing ESOPs, regardless of whether plans use the same plan year.

297 Nondiscriminatory contributions or benefit accruals In general There are three general approaches to test-ing the amount of benefits under qualified retirement plans: (1) design-based safe har-bors under which the plan’s contribution or benefit accrual formula satisfies certain uni-formity standards, (2) a general test, de-scribed below, and (3) cross-testing of equiva-lent contributions or benefit accruals. Em-ployee elective deferrals and employer matching contributions under defined con-tribution plans are subject to special testing rules and generally are not permitted to be taken into account in determining whether other contributions or benefits are non-discriminatory.
298 The nondiscrimination rules allow con-tributions and benefit accruals to be pro-vided to highly compensated and nonhighly compensated employees at the same percent-age of compensation.
299Thus, the various testing approaches described below are gen-erally applied to the amount of contribu-tions or accruals provided as a percentage of compensation, referred to as a contribution rate or accrual rate. In addition, under the ‘‘permitted disparity’’ rules, in calculating an employee’s contribution or accrual rate, credit may be given for the employer paid portion of Social Security taxes or bene-fits.
300The permitted disparity rules do not apply in testing whether elective deferrals, matching contributions, or ESOP contribu-tions are nondiscriminatory. The general test is generally satisfied by measuring the rate of contribution or benefit accrual for each highly compensated em-ployee to determine if the group of employ-ees with the same or higher rate (a ‘‘rate’’ group) is a nondiscriminatory group, using the nondiscriminatory plan coverage stand-ards described above. For this purpose, if the ratio percentage of a rate group is less than 70 percent, a simplified standard applies, which includes disregarding the reasonable classification requirement, but requires sat-isfaction of the average benefit percentage test. Cross-testing Cross-testing involves the conversion of contributions under a defined contribution plan or benefit accruals under a defined ben-efit plan to actuarially equivalent accruals or contributions, with the resulting equiva-lencies tested under the general test. How-ever, employee elective deferrals and em-ployer matching contributions under defined contribution plans are not permitted to be taken into account for this purpose, and cross-testing of contributions under a de-fined contribution plan, or cross-testing of a defined contribution plan aggregated with a defined benefit plan, is permitted only if cer-tain threshold requirements are satisfied. In order for a defined contribution plan to be tested on an equivalent benefit accrual basis, one of the following three threshold conditions must be met: ∑The plan has broadly available alloca-tion rates, that is, each allocation rate under the plan is available to a nondiscriminatory group of employees (disregarding certain permitted additional contributions provided to employees as a replacement for benefits under a frozen defined benefit plan, as dis-cussed below); ∑The plan provides allocations that meet prescribed designs under which allocations gradually increase with age or service or are expected to provide a target level of annuity benefit; or ∑The plan satisfies a minimum allocation gateway, under which each nonhighly com-pensated employee has an allocation rate of (a) at least one-third of the highest rate for any highly compensated employee, or (b) if less, at least five percent. In order for an aggregated defined con-tribution and defined benefit plan to be test-ed on an aggregate equivalent benefit ac-crual basis, one of the following three threshold conditions must be met: ∑The plan must be primarily defined ben-efit in character, that is, for more than fifty percent of the nonhighly compensated em-ployees under the plan, their accrual rate under the defined benefit plan exceeds their equivalent accrual rate under the defined contribution plan; ∑The plan consists of broadly available separate defined benefit and defined con-tribution plans, that is, the defined benefit plan and the defined contribution plan would separately satisfy simplified versions of the minimum coverage and nondiscriminatory amount requirements; or ∑The plan satisfies a minimum aggregate allocation gateway, under which each non-highly compensated employee has an aggre-gate allocation rate (consisting of alloca-tions under the defined contribution plan and equivalent allocations under the defined benefit plan) of (a) at least one-third of the highest aggregate allocation rate for any nonhighly compensated employee, or (b) if less, at least five percent in the case of a highest nonhighly compensated employee’s rate up to 25 percent, increased by one per-centage point for each five-percentage-point increment (or portion thereof) above 25 per-cent, subject to a maximum of 7.5 percent. Benefits, rights, and features Each benefit, right, or feature offered under the plan generally must be available to a group of employees that has a ratio per-centage that satisfies the minimum coverage requirements, including the reasonable clas-sification requirement if applicable, except that the average benefit percentage test does not have to be met, even if the ratio percent-age is less than 70 percent. Multiple-employer and section 403(b) plans A multiple-employer plan generally is a single plan maintained by two or more unre-lated employers, that is, employers that are not treated as a single employer under the aggregation rules for related entities.
301The plan coverage and other nondiscrimination requirements are applied separately to the portions of a multiple-employer plan cov-ering employees of different employers.
302 Certain tax-exempt charitable organiza-tions may offer their employees a tax-de-ferred annuity plan (‘‘section 403(b) plan’’).303 The nondiscrimination requirements, other than the requirements applicable to elective deferrals, generally apply to section 403(b) plans of private tax-exempt organizations. For purposes of applying the nondiscrimina-tion requirements to a section 403(b) plan, subject to mandatory disaggregation, a qualified retirement plan may be combined with the section 403(b) plan and treated as a single plan.
304However, a section 403(b) plan and qualified retirement plan may not be treated as a single plan for purposes of ap-plying the nondiscrimination requirements to the qualified retirement plan. Closed and frozen defined benefit plans A defined benefit plan may be amended to limit participation in the plan to individuals who are employees as of a certain date. That is, employees hired after that date are not eligible to participate in the plan. Such a plan is sometimes referred to as a ‘‘closed’’ defined benefit plan (that is, closed to new entrants). In such a case, it is common for the employer also to maintain a defined con-tribution plan and to provide employer matching or nonelective contributions only to employees not covered by the defined ben-efit plan or at a higher rate to such employ-ees. Over time, the group of employees con-tinuing to accrue benefits under the defined benefit plan may come to consist more heav-ily of highly compensated employees, for ex-ample, because of greater turnover among nonhighly compensated employees or be-cause increasing compensation causes non-highly compensated employees to become highly compensated. In that case, the de-fined benefit plan may have to be combined with the defined contribution plan and test-ed on a benefit accrual basis. However, under the regulations, if none of the threshold con-ditions is met, testing on a benefits basis may not be available. Notwithstanding the regulations, recent IRS guidance provides re-lief for a limited period, allowing certain closed defined benefit plans to be aggregated with a defined contribution plan and tested on an aggregate equivalent benefits basis without meeting any of the threshold condi-tions.
305When the group of employees con-tinuing to accrue benefits under a closed de-fined benefit plan consists more heavily of highly compensated employees, the benefits, rights, and features provided under the plan may also fail the tests under the existing nondiscrimination rules. In some cases, if a defined benefit plan is amended to cease future accruals for all par-ticipants, referred to as a ‘‘frozen’’ defined benefit plan, additional contributions to a defined contribution plan may be provided for participants, in particular for older par-ticipants, in order to make up in part for the loss of the benefits they expected to earn under the defined benefit plan (‘‘make- whole’’ contributions). As a practical mat-ter, testing on a benefit accrual basis may be required in that case, but may not be avail-able because the defined contribution plan does not meet any of the threshold condi-tions.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH10022 December 15, 2017 
306References under the provision to a closed class of participants and similar references to a closed class include arrangements under which one or more classes of participants are closed, except that one or more classes of participants closed on different dates are not aggregated for purposes of determining the date any such class was closed. 
307Other testing options available under present law are also available for this purpose. 
308This rule applies also for purposes applying the plan coverage and other nondiscrimination require-ments to an applicable defined benefit plan and one or more defined contributions that, under the provi-sion, may be treated as a single plan as described below. 
309Other testing options available under present law are also available for this purpose. 310Under the funding requirements applicable to defined benefit plans, target normal cost for a plan year (defined in section 430(b)(1)(A)(i)) is generally the sum of the present value of the benefits expected to be earned under the plan during the plan year plus the amount of plan-related expenses to be paid from plan assets during the plan year. Under the provision, in applying this average benefit rule to certain defined benefit plans maintained by coopera-tive organizations and charities, referred to as CSEC plans (defined in section 414(y)), which are subject to different funding requirements, the CSEC plan’s nor-mal cost under section 433(j)(1)(B) is used instead of target normal cost. HOUSE BILL  Closed or frozen defined benefit plans In general Under the House bill, nondiscrimination relief applies with respect to benefits, rights, and features for a closed class of participants (‘‘closed class’’),
306and with respect to ben-efit accruals for a closed class, under a de-fined benefit plan that meets the require-ments described below (referred to herein as an ‘‘applicable’’ defined benefit plan). In ad-dition, the provision treats a closed or frozen applicable defined benefit plan as meeting the minimum participation requirements if the plan met the requirements as of the ef-fective date of the plan amendment by which the plan was closed or frozen. If a portion of an applicable defined benefit plan eligible for relief under the provision is spun off to another employer, and if the spun-off plan continues to satisfy any ongo-ing requirements applicable for the relevant relief as described below, the relevant relief for the spun-off plan will continue with re-spect to the other employer. Benefits, rights, or features for a closed class Under the provision, an applicable defined benefit plan that provides benefits, rights, or features to a closed class does not fail the nondiscrimination requirements by reason of the composition of the closed class, or the benefits, rights, or features provided to the closed class, if (1) for the plan year as of which the class closes and the two suc-ceeding plan years, the benefits, rights, and features satisfy the nondiscrimination re-quirements without regard to the relief under the provision, but taking into account the special testing rules described below,
307 and (2) after the date as of which the class was closed, any plan amendment modifying the closed class or the benefits, rights, and features provided to the closed class does not discriminate significantly in favor of highly compensated employees. For purposes of requirement (1) above, the following special testing rules apply: ∑In applying the plan coverage transition rule for business acquisitions, dispositions, and similar transactions, the closing of the class of participants is not treated as a sig-nificant change in coverage; ∑Two or more plans do not fail to be eligi-ble to be a treated as a single plan solely by reason of having different plan years;
308and ∑Changes in employee population are dis-regarded to the extent attributable to indi-viduals who become employees or cease to be employees, after the date the class is closed, by reason of a merger, acquisition, divesti-ture, or similar event. Benefit accruals for a closed class Under the provision, an applicable defined benefit plan that provides benefits to a closed class may be aggregated, that is, treated as a single plan, and tested on a ben-efit accrual basis with one or more defined contribution plans (without having to satisfy the threshold conditions under present law) if (1) for the plan year as of which the class closes and the two succeeding plan years, the plan satisfies the plan coverage and non-discrimination requirements without regard to the relief under the provision, but taking into account the special testing rules de-scribed above,309and (2) after the date as of which the class was closed, any plan amend-ment modifying the closed class or the bene-fits provided to the closed class does not dis-criminate significantly in favor of highly compensated employees. Under the provision, defined contribution plans that may be aggregated with an appli-cable defined benefit plan and treated as a single plan include the portion of one or more defined contribution plans consisting of matching contributions, an ESOP, or matching or nonelective contributions under a section 403(b) plan. If an applicable defined benefit plan is aggregated with the portion of a defined contribution plan consisting of matching contributions, any portion of the defined contribution plan consisting of elec-tive deferrals must also be aggregated. In ad-dition, the matching contributions are treat-ed in the same manner as nonelective con-tributions, including for purposes of per-mitted disparity. Applicable defined benefit plan An applicable defined benefit plan to which relief under the provision applies is a defined benefit plan under which the class was closed (or the plan frozen) before April 5, 2017, or that meets the following alternative condi-tions: (1) taking into account any prede-cessor plan, the plan has been in effect for at least five years as of the date the class is closed (or the plan is frozen) and (2) under the plan, during the five-year period pre-ceding that date, (a) for purposes of the relief provided with respect to benefits, rights, and features for a closed class, there has not been a substantial increase in the coverage or value of the benefits, rights, or features, or (b) for purposes of the relief provided with respect to benefit accruals for a closed class or the minimum participation requirements, there has not been a substantial increase in the coverage or benefits under the plan. For purposes of (2)(a) above, a plan is treated as having a substantial increase in coverage or value of benefits, rights, or fea-tures only if, during the applicable five-year period, either the number of participants covered by the benefits, rights, or features on the date the period ends is more than 50 percent greater than the number on the first day of the plan year in which the period began, or the benefits, rights, and features have been modified by one or more plan amendments in such a way that, as of the date the class is closed, the value of the ben-efits, rights, and features to the closed class as a whole is substantially greater than the value as of the first day of the five-year pe-riod, solely as a result of the amendments. For purposes of (2)(b) above, a plan is treated as having had a substantial increase in coverage or benefits only if, during the ap-plicable five-year period, either the number of participants benefiting under the plan on the date the period ends is more than 50 per-cent greater than the number of participants on the first day of the plan year in which the period began, or the average benefit provided to participants on the date the period ends is more than 50 percent greater than the aver-age benefit provided on the first day of the plan year in which the period began. In ap-plying this requirement, the average benefit provided to participants under the plan is treated as having remained the same be-tween the two relevant dates if the benefit formula applicable to the participants has not changed between the dates and, if the benefit formula has changed, the average benefit under the plan is considered to have increased by more than 50 percent only if the target normal cost for all participants bene-fiting under the plan for the plan year in which the five-year period ends exceeds the target normal cost for all such participants for that plan year if determined using the benefit formula in effect for the participants for the first plan year in the five-year period by more than 50 percent.
310In applying these rules, a multiple-employer plan is treated as a single plan, rather than as separate plans separately covering the employees of each participating employer. In applying these standards, any increase in coverage or value, or in coverage or bene-fits, whichever is applicable, is generally dis-regarded if it is attributable to coverage and value, or coverage and benefits, provided to employees who (1) became participants as a result of a merger, acquisition, or similar event that occurred during the 7-year period preceding the date the class was closed, or (2) became participants by reason of a merger of the plan with another plan that had been in effect for at least five years as of the date of the merger and, in the case of benefits, rights, or features for a closed class, under the merger, the benefits, rights, or features under one plan were conformed to the bene-fits, rights, or features under the other plan prospectively. Make-whole contributions under a defined contribution plan Under the provision, a defined contribution plan is permitted to be tested on an equiva-lent benefit accrual basis (without having to satisfy the threshold conditions under present law) if the following requirements are met: ∑The plan provides make-whole contribu-tions to a closed class of participants whose accruals under a defined benefit plan have been reduced or ended (‘‘make-whole class’’); ∑For the plan year of the defined con-tribution plan as of which the make-whole class closes and the two succeeding plan years, the make-whole class satisfies the nondiscriminatory classification require-ment under the plan coverage rules, taking into account the special testing rules de-scribed above; ∑After the date as of which the class was closed, any amendment to the defined con-tribution plan modifying the make-whole class or the allocations, benefits, rights, and features provided to the make-whole class does not discriminate significantly in favor of highly compensated employees; and ∑Either the class was closed before April 5, 2017, or the defined benefit plan is an appli-cable defined benefit plan under the alter-native conditions applicable for purposes of the relief provided with respect to benefit ac-cruals for a closed class. With respect to one or more defined con-tribution plans meeting the requirements above, in applying the plan coverage and nondiscrimination requirements, the portion of the plan providing make-whole or other nonelective contributions may also be aggre-gated and tested on an equivalent benefit ac-crual basis with the portion of one or more

If the plan is aggre-gated with the portion of a defined contribu-tion plan consisting of matching contribu-tions, any portion of the defined contribu-tion plan consisting of elective deferrals must also be aggregated. In addition, the matching contributions are treated in the same manner as nonelective contributions, including for purposes of permitted dis-parity. Under the provision, ‘‘make-whole con-tributions’’ generally means nonelective contributions for each employee in the make-whole class that are reasonably cal-culated, in a consistent manner, to replace some or all of the retirement benefits that the employee would have received under the defined benefit plan and any other plan or qualified cash or deferred arrangement under a section 401(k) plan if no change had been made to the defined benefit plan and other plan or arrangement.
311However, under a special rule, in the case of a defined con-tribution plan that provides benefits, rights, or features to a closed class of participants whose accruals under a defined benefit plan have been reduced or eliminated, the plan will not fail to satisfy the nondiscrimination requirements solely by reason of the com-position of the closed class, or the benefits, rights, or features provided to the closed class, if the defined contribution plan and de-fined benefit plan otherwise meet the re-quirements described above but for the fact that the make-whole contributions under the defined contribution plan are made in whole or in part through matching contributions. If a portion of a defined contribution plan eligible for relief under the provision is spun off to another employer, and if the spun-off plan continues to satisfy any ongoing re-quirements applicable for the relevant relief as described above, the relevant relief for the spun-off plan will continue with respect to the other employer. Effective date.—The provision is generally effective on the date of enactment without regard to whether any plan modifications re-ferred to in the provision are adopted or ef-fective before, on, or after the date of enact-ment. However, at the election of a plan sponsor, the provision will apply to plan years beginning after December 31, 2013. For purposes of the provision, a closed class of participants under a defined benefit plan is treated as being closed before April 5, 2017, if the plan sponsor’s intention to create the closed class is reflected in formal written documents and communicated to partici-pants before that date. In addition, a plan does not fail to be eligible for the relief under the provision solely because (1) in the case of benefits, rights, or features for a closed class under a defined benefit plan, the plan was amended before the date of enact-ment to eliminate one or more benefits, rights, or features and is further amended after the date of enactment to provide the previously eliminated benefits, rights, or features to a closed class of participants, or (2) in the case of benefit accruals for a closed class under a defined benefit plan or applica-tion of the minimum benefit requirements to a closed or frozen defined benefit plan, the plan was amended before the date of the en-actment to cease all benefit accruals and is further amended after the date of enactment to provide benefit accruals to a closed class of participants. In either case, the relevant relief applies only if the plan otherwise meets the requirements for the relief, and, in applying the relevant relief, the date the class of participants is closed is the effective date of the later amendment. SENATE AMENDMENT  No provision. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement does not include the House bill provision. 7. Modification of rules applicable to length of service award programs for bona fide public safety volunteers (sec. 13612 of the Senate amendment and sec. 457(e) of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  Special rules apply to deferred compensa-tion plans of State and local government and private, tax-exempt employers.
312However, an exception to these rules applies in the case of a plan paying solely length of service awards to bona fide volunteers (or their beneficiaries) on account of qualified serv-ices performed by the volunteers. For this purpose, qualified services consist of fire-fighting and fire prevention services, emer-gency medical services, and ambulance serv-ices. An individual is treated as a bona fide volunteer for this purpose if the only com-pensation received by the individual for per-forming qualified services is in the form of (1) reimbursement or a reasonable allowance for reasonable expenses incurred in the per-formance of such services, or (2) reasonable benefits (including length of service awards) and nominal fees for the services, custom-arily paid in connection with the perform-ance of such services by volunteers. The ex-ception applies only if the aggregate amount of length of service awards accruing for a bona fide volunteer with respect to any year of service does not exceed $3,000. 
HOUSE BILL  No provision. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The Senate amendment increases the ag-gregate amount of length of service awards that may accrue for a bona fide volunteer with respect to any year of service to $6,000 and adjusts that amount in $500 increments to reflect changes in cost-of-living for years after the first year the provision is effective. In addition, under the provision, if the plan is a defined benefit plan, the limit applies to the actuarial present value of the aggregate amount of length of service awards accruing with respect to any year of service. Actu-arial present value is to be calculated using reasonable actuarial assumptions and meth-ods, assuming payment will be made under the most valuable form of payment under the plan with payment commencing at the later of the earliest age at which unreduced benefits are payable under the plan or the participant’s age at the time of the calcula-tion. Effective date.—The provision is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the Sen-ate amendment. F. Modifications to Estate, Gift, and Genera-tion-Skipping Transfers Taxes (secs. 1601 and 1602 of the House bill, sec. 11061 of the Senate amendment, and secs. 2001 and 2010 of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  In general A gift tax is imposed on certain lifetime transfers, and an estate tax is imposed on certain transfers at death. A generation- skipping transfer tax generally is imposed on transfers, either directly or in trust or simi-lar arrangement, to a ‘‘skip person’’ (i.e., a beneficiary in a generation more than one generation younger than that of the trans-feror). Transfers subject to the generation- skipping transfer tax include direct skips, taxable terminations, and taxable distribu-tions. Income tax rules determine the recipient’s tax basis in property acquired from a dece-dent or by gift. Gifts and bequests generally are excluded from the recipient’s gross in-come.313 Common features of the estate, gift and gen-eration-skipping transfer taxes Unified credit (exemption) and tax rates Unified credit.—A unified credit is available with respect to taxable transfers by gift and at death.
314The unified credit offsets tax, computed using the applicable estate and gift tax rates, on a specified amount of transfers, referred to as the applicable exclu-sion amount, or exemption amount. The ex-emption amount was set at $5 million for 2011 and is indexed for inflation for later years.
315For 2017, the inflation-indexed ex-emption amount is $5.49 million.
316Exemp- tion used during life to offset taxable gifts reduces the amount of exemption that re-mains at death to offset the value of a dece-dent’s estate. An election is available under which exemption that is not used by a dece-dent may be used by the decedent’s surviving spouse (exemption portability). Common tax rate table.—A common tax-rate table with a top marginal tax rate of 40 per-cent is used to compute gift tax and estate tax. The 40-percent rate applies to transfers in excess of $1 million (to the extent not ex-empt). Because the exemption amount cur-rently shields the first $5.49 million in gifts and bequests from tax, transfers in excess of the exemption amount generally are subject to tax at the highest marginal rate (40 per-cent). Generation-skipping transfer tax exemption and rate.—The generation-skipping transfer tax is a separate tax that can apply in addi-tion to either the gift tax or the estate tax. The tax rate and exemption amount for gen-eration-skipping transfer tax purposes, how-ever, are set by reference to the estate tax rules. Generation-skipping transfer tax is imposed using a flat rate equal to the high-est estate tax rate (40 percent). Tax is im-posed on cumulative generation-skipping transfers in excess of the generation-skip-ping transfer tax exemption amount in effect for the year of the transfer. The generation- skipping transfer tax exemption for a given year is equal to the estate tax exemption amount in effect for that year (currently $5.49 million). Transfers between spouses.—A 100-percent marital deduction generally is permitted for the value of property transferred between spouses.
317In addition, transfers of ‘‘quali-fied terminable interest property’’ also are eligible for the marital deduction. Qualified terminable interest property is property: (1) that passes from the decedent, (2) in which the surviving spouse has a ‘‘qualifying in-come interest for life,’’ and (3) to which an election under these rules applies. A quali-fying income interest for life exists if: (1) the surviving spouse is entitled to all the income

322More mechanically, the taxable estate is com-bined with the value of adjusted taxable gifts made during the decedent’s life (generally, post-1976 gifts), before applying tax rates to determine a tentative total amount of tax. The portion of the tentative tax attributable to lifetime gifts is then subtracted from the total tentative tax to determine the gross estate tax, i.e., the amount of estate tax before con-sidering available credits. Credits are then sub-tracted to determine the estate tax liability. This method of computation was designed to en-sure that a taxpayer only gets one run up through the rate brackets for all lifetime gifts and transfers at death, at a time when the thresholds for applying the higher marginal rates exceeded the exemption amount. However, the higher ($5.49 million) present- law exemption amount effectively renders the lower rate brackets irrelevant, because the top marginal rate bracket applies to all transfers in excess of $1 million. In other words, all transfers that are not ex-empt by reason of the $5.49 million exemption amount are taxed at the highest marginal rate of 40 percent.

A marital deduction generally is denied for property passing to a surviving spouse who is not a citizen of the United States. A marital deduction is permitted, however, for prop-erty passing to a qualified domestic trust of which the noncitizen surviving spouse is a beneficiary. A qualified domestic trust is a trust that has as its trustee at least one U.S. citizen or U.S. corporation. No corpus may be distributed from a qualified domestic trust unless the U.S. trustee has the right to withhold any estate tax imposed on the dis-tribution. Tax is imposed on (1) any distribution from a qualified domestic trust before the date of the death of the noncitizen surviving spouse and (2) the value of the property remaining in a qualified domestic trust on the date of death of the noncitizen surviving spouse. The tax is computed as an additional estate tax on the estate of the first spouse to die. Transfers to charity.—Contributions to sec-tion 501(c)(3) charitable organizations and certain other organizations may be deducted from the value of a gift or from the value of the assets in an estate for Federal gift or es-tate tax purposes.
318The effect of the deduc-tion generally is to remove the full fair mar-ket value of assets transferred to charity from the gift or estate tax base; unlike the income tax charitable deduction, there are no percentage limits on the deductible amount. For estate tax purposes, the chari-table deduction is limited to the value of the transferred property that is required to be included in the gross estate.
319A charitable contribution of a partial interest in prop-erty, such as a remainder or future interest, generally is not deductible for gift or estate tax purposes.
320 The estate tax Overview The Code imposes a tax on the transfer of the taxable estate of a decedent who is a cit-izen or resident of the United States.
321The taxable estate is determined by deducting from the value of the decedent’s gross estate any deductions provided for in the Code. After applying tax rates to determine a ten-tative amount of estate tax, certain credits are subtracted to determine estate tax liabil-ity.
322 Because the estate tax shares a common unified credit (exemption) and tax rate table with the gift tax, the exemption amounts and tax rates are described together above, along with certain other common features of these taxes. Gross estate A decedent’s gross estate includes, to the extent provided for in other sections of the Code, the date-of-death value of all of a dece-dent’s property, real or personal, tangible or intangible, wherever situated.323In general, the value of property for this purpose is the fair market value of the property as of the date of the decedent’s death, although an ex-ecutor may elect to value certain property as of the date that is six months after the de-cedent’s death (the alternate valuation date).
324 The gross estate includes not only prop-erty directly owned by the decedent, but also other property in which the decedent had a beneficial interest at the time of his or her death.
325The gross estate also includes cer-tain transfers made by the decedent prior to his or her death, including: (1) certain gifts made within three years prior to the dece-dent’s death;
326(2) certain transfers of prop-erty in which the decedent retained a life es-tate;
327(3) certain transfers taking effect at death;
328and (4) revocable transfers.329In ad- dition, the gross estate also includes prop-erty with respect to which the decedent had, at the time of death, a general power of ap-pointment (generally, the right to determine who will have beneficial ownership).
330The value of a life insurance policy on the dece-dent’s life is included in the gross estate if the proceeds are payable to the decedent’s estate or the decedent had incidents of own-ership with respect to the policy at the time of his or her death.
331 Deductions from the gross estate A decedent’s taxable estate is determined by subtracting from the value of the gross estate any deductions provided for in the Code. Marital and charitable transfers.—As de-scribed above, transfers to a surviving spouse or to charity generally are deductible for es-tate tax purposes. The effect of the marital and charitable deductions generally is to re-move assets transferred to a surviving spouse or to charity from the estate tax base. State death taxes.—An estate tax deduction is permitted for death taxes (e.g., any estate, inheritance, legacy, or succession taxes) ac-tually paid to any State or the District of Columbia, in respect of property included in the gross estate of the decedent.
332Such State taxes must have been paid and claimed before the later of: (1) four years after the filing of the estate tax return; or (2) (a) 60 days after a decision of the U.S. Tax Court determining the estate tax liability becomes final, (b) the expiration of the period of ex-tension to pay estate taxes over time under section 6166, or (c) the expiration of the pe-riod of limitations in which to file a claim for refund or 60 days after a decision of a court in which such refund suit has become final. Other deductions.—A deduction is available for funeral expenses, estate administration expenses, and claims against the estate, in-cluding certain taxes.
333A deduction also is available for uninsured casualty and theft losses incurred during the settlement of the estate.
334 Credits against tax After accounting for allowable deductions, a gross amount of estate tax is computed. Estate tax liability is then determined by subtracting allowable credits from the gross estate tax. Unified credit.—The most significant credit allowed for estate tax purposes is the unified credit, which is discussed in greater detail above.335For 2017, the value of the unified credit is $2,141,800, which has the effect of ex-empting $5.49 million in transfers from tax. The unified credit available at death is re-duced by the amount of unified credit used to offset gift tax on gifts made during the de-cedent’s life. Other credits.—Estate tax credits also are allowed for: (1) gift tax paid on certain pre- 1977 gifts (before the estate and gift tax com-putations were integrated);
336(2) estate tax paid on certain prior transfers (to limit the estate tax burden when estate tax is imposed on transfers of the same property in two es-tates by reason of deaths in rapid succes-sion);
337and (3) certain foreign death taxes paid (generally, where the property is situ-ated in a foreign country but included in the decedent’s U.S. gross estate).
338 Provisions affecting small and family-owned businesses and farms Special-use valuation.—An executor can elect to value for estate tax purposes certain ‘‘qualified real property’’ used in farming or another qualifying closely-held trade or business at its current-use value, rather than its fair market value.
339The maximum re-duction in value for such real property is $750,000 (adjusted for inflation occurring after 1997; the inflation-adjusted amount for 2017 is $1,120,000). In general, real property qualifies for special-use valuation only if (1) at least 50 percent of the adjusted value of the decedent’s gross estate (including both real and personal property) consists of a farm or closely-held business property in the decedent’s estate and (2) at least 25 percent of the adjusted value of the gross estate con-sists of farm or closely held business real property. In addition, the property must be used in a qualified use (e.g., farming) by the decedent or a member of the decedent’s fam-ily for five of the eight years before the dece-dent’s death. If, after a special-use valuation election is made, the heir who acquired the real prop-erty ceases to use it in its qualified use with-in 10 years of the decedent’s death, an addi-tional estate tax is imposed to recapture the entire estate-tax benefit of the special-use valuation. Installment payment of estate tax for closely held businesses.—Under present law, the estate tax generally is due within nine months of a decedent’s death. However, an executor generally may elect to pay estate tax attributable to an interest in a closely held business in two or more installments (but no more than 10).
340An estate is eligible for payment of estate tax in installments if the value of the decedent’s interest in a closely held business exceeds 35 percent of the decedent’s adjusted gross estate (i.e., the gross estate less certain deductions). If the election is made, the estate may defer pay-ment of principal and pay only interest for the first five years, followed by up to 10 an-nual installments of principal and interest. This provision effectively extends the time for paying estate tax by 14 years from the

The applicable fraction is the amount of exemption allocated to a trust (or to a direct skip) divided by the value of assets transferred. original due date of the estate tax. A special two-percent interest rate applies to the amount of deferred estate tax attributable to the first $1 million (adjusted annually for in-flation occurring after 1998; the inflation-ad-justed amount for 2017 is $1,490,000) in tax-able value of a closely held business. The in-terest rate applicable to the amount of es-tate tax attributable to the taxable value of the closely held business in excess of $1 mil-lion (adjusted for inflation) is equal to 45 percent of the rate applicable to underpay-ments of tax under section 6621 of the Code (i.e., 45 percent of the Federal short-term rate plus three percentage points).
341Interest paid on deferred estate taxes is not deduct-ible for estate or income tax purposes. The gift tax Overview The Code imposes a tax for each calendar year on the transfer of property by gift dur-ing such year by any individual, whether a resident or nonresident of the United States.
342The amount of taxable gifts for a calendar year is determined by subtracting from the total amount of gifts made during the year: (1) the gift tax annual exclusion (described below); and (2) allowable deduc-tions. Gift tax for the current taxable year is de-termined by: (1) computing a tentative tax on the combined amount of all taxable gifts for the current and all prior calendar years using the common gift tax and estate tax rate table; (2) computing a tentative tax only on all prior-year gifts; (3) subtracting the tentative tax on prior-year gifts from the tentative tax computed for all years to ar-rive at the portion of the total tentative tax attributable to current-year gifts; and, fi-nally, (4) subtracting the amount of unified credit not consumed by prior-year gifts. Because the gift tax shares a common uni-fied credit (exemption) and tax rate table with the estate tax, the exemption amounts and tax rates are described together above, along with certain other common features of these taxes. Transfers by gift The gift tax applies to a transfer by gift re-gardless of whether: (1) the transfer is made outright or in trust; (2) the gift is direct or indirect; or (3) the property is real or per-sonal, tangible or intangible.
343For gift tax purposes, the value of a gift of property is the fair market value of the property at the time of the gift.
344Where property is trans-ferred for less than full consideration, the amount by which the value of the property exceeds the value of the consideration is con-sidered a gift and is included in computing the total amount of a taxpayer’s gifts for a calendar year.
345 For a gift to occur, a donor generally must relinquish dominion and control over do-nated property. For example, if a taxpayer transfers assets to a trust established for the benefit of his or her children, but retains the right to revoke the trust, the taxpayer may not have made a completed gift, because the taxpayer has retained dominion and control over the transferred assets. A completed gift made in trust, on the other hand, often is treated as a gift to the trust beneficiaries. By reason of statute, certain transfers are not treated as transfers by gift for gift tax purposes. These include, for example, certain transfers for educational and medical pur-poses,
346transfers to section 527 political or-ganizations,347and transfers to tax-exempt organizations described in sections 501(c)(4), (5), or (6).
348 Taxable gifts As stated above, the amount of a tax-payer’s taxable gifts for the year is deter-mined by subtracting from the total amount of the taxpayer’s gifts for the year the gift tax annual exclusion and any available de-ductions. Gift tax annual exclusion.—Under present law, donors of lifetime gifts are provided an annual exclusion of $14,000 per donee in 2017 (indexed for inflation from the 1997 annual exclusion amount of $10,000) for gifts of present interests in property during the tax-able year.
349If the non-donor spouse consents to split the gift with the donor spouse, then the annual exclusion is $28,000 per donee in 2017. In general, unlimited transfers between spouses are permitted without imposition of a gift tax. Special rules apply to the con-tributions to a qualified tuition program (‘‘529 Plan’’) including an election to treat a contribution that exceeds the annual exclu-sion as a contribution made ratably over a five-year period beginning with the year of the contribution.
350 Marital and charitable deductions.— As de- scribed above, transfers to a surviving spouse or to charity generally are deductible for gift tax purposes. The effect of the marital and charitable deductions generally is to remove assets transferred to a surviving spouse or to charity from the gift tax base. The generation-skipping transfer tax A generation-skipping transfer tax gen-erally is imposed (in addition to the gift tax or the estate tax) on transfers, either di-rectly or in trust or similar arrangement, to a ‘‘skip person’’ (i.e., a beneficiary in a gen-eration more than one generation below that of the transferor). Transfers subject to the generation-skipping transfer tax include di-rect skips, taxable terminations, and taxable distributions. Exemption and tax rate An exemption generally equal to the estate tax exemption amount ($5.49 million for 2017) is provided for each person making genera-tion-skipping transfers. The exemption may be allocated by a transferor (or his or her ex-ecutor) to transferred property, and in some cases is automatically allocated. The alloca-tion of generation-skipping transfer tax ex-emption effectively reduces the tax rate on a generation-skipping transfer. The tax rate on generation-skipping trans-fers is a flat rate of tax equal to the max-imum estate and gift tax rate (40 percent) multiplied by the ‘‘inclusion ratio.’’ The in-clusion ratio with respect to any property transferred indicates the amount of ‘‘genera-tion-skipping transfer tax exemption’’ allo-cated to a trust (or to property transferred in a direct skip) relative to the total value of property transferred.
351If, for example, a taxpayer transfers $5 million in property to a trust and allocates $5 million of exemption to the transfer, the inclusion ratio is zero, and the applicable tax rate on any subse-quent generation-skipping transfers from the trust is zero percent (40 percent multiplied by the inclusion ratio of zero). If, however, the taxpayer allocated only $2.5 million of exemption to the transfer, the inclusion ratio is 0.5, and the applicable tax rate on any subsequent generation-skipping trans-fers from the trust is 20 percent (40 percent multiplied by the inclusion ratio of 0.5). If the taxpayer allocates no exemption to the transfer, the inclusion ratio is one, and the applicable tax rate on any subsequent gen-eration-skipping transfers from the trust is 40 percent (40 percent multiplied by the in-clusion ratio of one). Generation-skipping transfers Generation-skipping transfer tax generally is imposed at the time of a generation-skip-ping transfer—a direct skip, a taxable termi-nation, or a taxable distribution. A direct skip is any transfer subject to es-tate or gift tax of an interest in property to a skip person. A skip person may be a nat-ural person or certain trusts. All persons as-signed to the second or more remote genera-tion below the transferor are skip persons (e.g., grandchildren and great-grand-children). Trusts are skip persons if (1) all in-terests in the trust are held by skip persons, or (2) no person holds an interest in the trust and at no time after the transfer may a dis-tribution (including distributions and termi-nations) be made to a non-skip person. A taxable termination is a termination (by death, lapse of time, release of power, or oth-erwise) of an interest in property held in trust unless, immediately after such termi-nation, a non-skip person has an interest in the property, or unless at no time after the termination may a distribution (including a distribution upon termination) be made from the trust to a skip person. A taxable distribution is a distribution from a trust to a skip person (other than a taxable termination or direct skip). If a transferor allocates generation-skipping transfer tax exemption to a trust prior to the taxable distribution, generation-skipping transfer tax may be avoided. Income tax basis in property received In general Gain or loss, if any, on the disposition of property is measured by the taxpayer’s amount realized (i.e., gross proceeds re-ceived) on the disposition, less the tax-payer’s basis in such property. Basis gen-erally represents a taxpayer’s investment in property with certain adjustments required after acquisition. For example, basis is in-creased by the cost of capital improvements made to the property and decreased by de-preciation deductions taken with respect to the property. A gift or bequest of appreciated (or loss) property is not an income tax realization event for the transferor. The Code provides special rules for determining a recipient’s basis in assets received by lifetime gift or from a decedent. Basis in property received by lifetime gift Under present law, property received from a donor of a lifetime gift generally takes a carryover basis. ‘‘Carryover basis’’ means that the basis in the hands of the donee is the same as it was in the hands of the donor. The basis of property transferred by lifetime gift also is increased, but not above fair mar-ket value, by any gift tax paid by the donor. The basis of a lifetime gift, however, gen-erally cannot exceed the property’s fair mar-ket value on the date of the gift. If a donor’s basis in property is greater than the fair market value of the property on the date of the gift, then, for purposes of determining loss on a subsequent sale of the property, the donee’s basis is the property’s fair market value on the date of the gift. Basis in property acquired from a decedent Property acquired from a decedent’s estate generally takes a stepped-up basis. ‘‘Stepped-up basis’’ means that the basis of property acquired from a decedent’s estate

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH10026 December 15, 2017 
generally is the fair market value on the date of the decedent’s death (or, if the alter-nate valuation date is elected, the earlier of six months after the decedent’s death or the date the property is sold or distributed by the estate). Providing a fair market value basis eliminates the recognition of income on any appreciation of the property that oc-curred prior to the decedent’s death and eliminates the tax benefit from any unreal-ized loss. In community property states, a surviving spouse’s one-half share of community prop-erty held by the decedent and the surviving spouse (under the community property laws of any State, U.S. possession, or foreign country) generally is treated as having passed from the decedent and, thus, is eligi-ble for stepped-up basis. Thus, both the dece-dent’s one-half share and the surviving spouse’s one-half share are stepped up to fair market value. This rule applies if at least one-half of the whole of the community in-terest is includible in the decedent’s gross estate. Stepped-up basis treatment generally is denied to certain interests in foreign enti-ties. Stock in a passive foreign investment company (including those for which a mark- to-market election has been made) generally takes a carryover basis, except that stock of a passive foreign investment company for which a decedent shareholder had made a qualified electing fund election is allowed a stepped-up basis. Stock owned by a decedent in a domestic international sales corporation (or former domestic international sales cor-poration) takes a stepped-up basis reduced by the amount (if any) which would have been included in gross income under section 995(c) as a dividend if the decedent had lived and sold the stock at its fair market value on the estate tax valuation date (i.e., gen-erally the date of the decedent’s death unless an alternate valuation date is elected). 
HOUSE BILL  The provision doubles the estate and gift tax exemption for decedents dying and gifts made after December 31, 2017. This is accom-plished by increasing the basic exclusion amount provided in section 2010(c)(3) of the Code from $5 million to $10 million. The $10 million amount is indexed for inflation oc-curring after 2011. For estates of decedents dying and genera-tion-skipping transfers made after December 31, 2024, the provision repeals the estate tax and the generation-skipping transfer tax. The provision includes a transition rule for assets placed in a qualified domestic trust by a decedent who died before the effective date of the provision. Specifically, estate tax will not be imposed on: (1) distributions before the death of a surviving spouse from the trust more than 10 years after the date of en-actment; or (2) assets remaining in the quali-fied domestic trust upon the death of the surviving spouse. The top marginal gift tax rate is reduced to 35 percent for gifts made after December 31, 2024. The provision generally retains the present law rules for determining the income tax basis of assets acquired by gift and assets ac-quired from a decedent. As a result, property received from a donor of a lifetime gift gen-erally will continue to take a carryover basis, and property acquired from a dece-dent’s estate generally will continue to take a stepped-up basis. Effective date.—The doubling of the estate and gift tax exemption is effective for es-tates of decedents dying, generation-skip-ping transfers, and gifts made after Decem-ber 31, 2017. The repeal of the estate and gen-eration-skipping transfer taxes, and the re-duction in the gift tax rate to 35 percent, are effective for estates of decedents dying, gen-eration-skipping transfers, and gifts made after December 31, 2024. SENATE AMENDMENT  The provision doubles the estate and gift tax exemption for estates of decedents dying and gifts made after December 31, 2017, and before January 1, 2026. This is accomplished by increasing the basic exclusion amount provided in section 2010(c)(3) of the Code from $5 million to $10 million. The $10 mil-lion amount is indexed for inflation occur-ring after 2011. As a conforming amendment to section 2010(g) (regarding computation of estate tax), the provision provides that the Secretary shall prescribe regulations as may be nec-essary or appropriate to carry out the pur-poses of the section with respect to dif-ferences between the basic exclusion amount in effect: (1) at the time of the decedent’s death; and (2) at the time of any gifts made by the decedent. Effective date.—The provision is effective for estates of decedents dying and gifts made after December 31, 2017. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the Sen-ate amendment. G. Alternative Minimum Tax (sec. 2001 of the House bill, sec. 12001 of the Senate amend-ment, and secs. 53 and 55–59 of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  Individual alternative minimum tax In general An alternative minimum tax (‘‘AMT’’) is imposed on an individual, estate, or trust in an amount by which the tentative minimum tax exceeds the regular income tax for the taxable year. For taxable years beginning in 2017, the tentative minimum tax is the sum of (1) 26 percent of so much of the taxable ex-cess as does not exceed $187,800 ($93,900 in the case of a married individual filing a separate return) and (2) 28 percent of the remaining taxable excess. The breakpoints are indexed for inflation. The taxable excess is so much of the alternative minimum taxable income (‘‘AMTI’’) as exceeds the exemption amount. The maximum tax rates on net capital gain and dividends used in computing the regular tax are used in computing the tentative min-imum tax. AMTI is the taxable income ad-justed to take account of specified tax pref-erences and adjustments. The exemption amounts for taxable years beginning in 2017 are: (1) $84,500 in the case of married individuals filing a joint return and surviving spouses; (2) $54,300 in the case of other unmarried individuals; (3) $42,250 in the case of married individuals filing separate returns; and (4) $24,100 in the case of an es-tate or trust. For taxable years beginning in 2017, the exemption amounts are phased out by an amount equal to 25 percent of the amount by which the individual’s AMTI ex-ceeds (1) $160,900 in the case of married indi-viduals filing a joint return and surviving spouses, (2) $120,700 in the case of other un-married individuals, and (3) $80,450 in the case of married individuals filing separate returns or an estate or a trust. The amounts are indexed for inflation. AMTI is the taxpayer’s taxable income in-creased by certain preference items and ad-justed by determining the tax treatment of certain items in a manner that negates the deferral of income resulting from the regular tax treatment of those items. Preference items in computing AMTI The minimum tax preference items are: 1. The excess of the deduction for percent-age depletion over the adjusted basis of each mineral property (other than oil and gas properties) at the end of the taxable year. 2. The amount by which excess intangible drilling costs (i.e., expenses in excess the amount that would have been allowable if amortized over a 10-year period) exceed 65 percent of the net income from oil, gas, and geothermal properties. This preference ap-plies to independent producers only to the extent it reduces the producer’s AMTI (de-termined without regard to this preference and the net operating loss deduction) by more than 40 percent. 3. Tax-exempt interest income on private activity bonds (other than qualified 501(c)(3) bonds, certain housing bonds, and bonds issued in 2009 and 2010) issued after August 7, 1986. 4. Accelerated depreciation or amortiza-tion on certain property placed in service be-fore January 1, 1987. 5. Seven percent of the amount excluded from income under section 1202 (relating to gains on the sale of certain small business stock). In addition, losses from any tax shelter farm activity or passive activities are not taken into account in computing AMTI. Adjustments in computing AMTI The adjustments that individuals must make to compute AMTI are: 1. Depreciation on property placed in serv-ice after 1986 and before January 1, 1999, is computed by using the generally longer class lives prescribed by the alternative deprecia-tion system of section 168(g) and either (a) the straight-line method in the case of prop-erty subject to the straight-line method under the regular tax or (b) the 150-percent declining balance method in the case of other property. Depreciation on property placed in service after December 31, 1998, is computed by using the regular tax recovery periods and the AMT methods described in the previous sentence. Depreciation on prop-erty acquired after September 10, 2001, which is allowed an additional allowance under sec-tion 168(k) for the regular tax is computed without regard to any AMT adjustments. 2. Mining exploration and development costs are capitalized and amortized over a 10- year period. 3. Taxable income from a long-term con-tract (other than a home construction con-tract) is computed using the percentage of completion method of accounting. 4. Depreciation on property placed in serv-ice after 1986 and before January 1, 1999, is computed by using the generally longer class lives prescribed by the alternative deprecia-tion system of section 168(g) and either (a) the straight-line method in the case of prop-erty subject to the straight-line method under the regular tax or (b) the 150-percent declining balance method in the case of other property. Depreciation on property placed in service after December 31, 1998, is computed by using the regular tax recovery periods and the AMT methods described in the previous sentence. Depreciation on prop-erty acquired after September 10, 2001, which is allowed an additional allowance under sec-tion 168(k) for the regular tax is computed without regard to any AMT adjustments. 5. Mining exploration and development costs are capitalized and amortized over a 10- year period. 6. Taxable income from a long-term con-tract (other than a home construction con-tract) is computed using the percentage of completion method of accounting. 7. The amortization deduction allowed for pollution control facilities placed in service before January 1, 1999 (generally determined using 60-month amortization for a portion of the cost of the facility under the regular tax), is calculated under the alternative de-preciation system (generally, using longer class lives and the straight-line method). The amortization deduction allowed for pol-lution control facilities placed in service

after December 31, 1998, is calculated using the regular tax recovery periods and the straight-line method. 8. Miscellaneous itemized deductions are not allowed. 9. Itemized deductions for State, local, and foreign real property taxes; State and local personal property taxes; State, local, and foreign income, war profits, and excess prof-its taxes; and State and local sales taxes are not allowed. 10. Medical expenses are allowed only to the extent they exceed ten percent of the taxpayer’s adjusted gross income. 11. Deductions for interest on home equity loans are not allowed. 12. The standard deduction and the deduc-tion for personal exemptions are not allowed. 13. The amount allowable as a deduction for circulation expenditures is capitalized and amortized over a three-year period. 14. The amount allowable as a deduction for research and experimentation expendi-tures from passive activities is capitalized and amortized over a 10-year period. 15. The regular tax rules relating to incen-tive stock options do not apply. Other rules The taxpayer’s net operating loss deduc-tion generally cannot reduce the taxpayer’s AMTI by more than 90 percent of the AMTI (determined without the net operating loss deduction). The alternative minimum tax foreign tax credit reduces the tentative minimum tax. The various nonrefundable business credits allowed under the regular tax generally are not allowed against the AMT. Certain excep-tions apply. If an individual is subject to AMT in any year, the amount of tax exceeding the tax-payer’s regular tax liability is allowed as a credit (the ‘‘AMT credit’’) in any subsequent taxable year to the extent the taxpayer’s regular tax liability exceeds his or her ten-tative minimum tax liability in such subse-quent year. The AMT credit is allowed only to the extent that the taxpayer’s AMT liabil-ity is the result of adjustments that are tim-ing in nature. The individual AMT adjust-ments relating to itemized deductions and personal exemptions are not timing in na-ture, and no minimum tax credit is allowed with respect to these items. An individual may elect to write off cer-tain expenditures paid or incurred with re-spect of circulation expenses, research and experimental expenses, intangible drilling and development expenditures, development expenditures, and mining exploration ex-penditures over a specified period (three years in the case of circulation expenses, 60 months in the case of intangible drilling and development expenditures, and 10 years in case of other expenditures). The election ap-plies for purposes of both the regular tax and the alternative minimum tax. Corporate alternative minimum tax In general An AMT is also imposed on a corporation to the extent the corporation’s tentative minimum tax exceeds its regular tax. This tentative minimum tax is computed at the rate of 20 percent on the AMTI in excess of a $40,000 exemption amount that phases out. The exemption amount is phased out by an amount equal to 25 percent of the amount that the corporation’s AMTI exceeds $150,000. AMTI is the taxpayer’s taxable income in-creased by certain preference items and ad-justed by determining the tax treatment of certain items in a manner that negates the deferral of income resulting from the regular tax treatment of those items. A corporation with average gross receipts of less than $7.5 million for the prior three taxable years is exempt from the corporate minimum tax. The $7.5 million threshold is reduced to $5 million for the corporation’s first three-taxable year period. Preference items in computing AMTI The corporate minimum tax preference items are: 1. The excess of the deduction for percent-age depletion over the adjusted basis of the property at the end of the taxable year. This preference does not apply to percentage de-pletion allowed with respect to oil and gas properties. 2. The amount by which excess intangible drilling costs arising in the taxable year ex-ceed 65 percent of the net income from oil, gas, and geothermal properties. This pref-erence does not apply to an independent pro-ducer to the extent the preference would not reduce the producer’s AMTI by more than 40 percent. 3. Tax-exempt interest income on private activity bonds (other than qualified 501(c)(3) bonds, certain housing bonds, and bonds issued in 2009 and 2010) issued after August 7, 1986. 4. Accelerated depreciation or amortiza-tion on certain property placed in service be-fore January 1, 1987. Adjustments in computing AMTI The adjustments that corporations must make in computing AMTI are: 1. Depreciation on property placed in serv-ice after 1986 and before January 1, 1999, must be computed by using the generally longer class lives prescribed by the alter-native depreciation system of section 168(g) and either (a) the straight-line method in the case of property subject to the straight-line method under the regular tax or (b) the 150- percent declining balance method in the case of other property. Depreciation on property placed in service after December 31, 1998, is computed by using the regular tax recovery periods and the AMT methods described in the previous sentence. Depreciation on prop-erty which is allowed ‘‘bonus depreciation’’ for the regular tax is computed without re-gard to any AMT adjustments. 2. Mining exploration and development costs must be capitalized and amortized over a 10-year period. 3. Taxable income from a long-term con-tract (other than a home construction con-tract) must be computed using the percent-age of completion method of accounting. 4. The amortization deduction allowed for pollution control facilities placed in service before January 1, 1999 (generally determined using 60-month amortization for a portion of the cost of the facility under the regular tax), must be calculated under the alter-native depreciation system (generally, using longer class lives and the straight-line meth-od). The amortization deduction allowed for pollution control facilities placed in service after December 31, 1998, is calculated using the regular tax recovery periods and the straight-line method. 5. The special rules applicable to Merchant Marine construction funds are not applica-ble. 6. The special deduction allowable under section 833(b) for Blue Cross and Blue Shield organizations is not allowed. 7. The adjusted current earnings adjust-ment applies, as described below. Adjusted current earning (‘‘ACE’’) adjustment The adjusted current earnings adjustment is the amount equal to 75 percent of the amount by which the adjusted current earn-ings of a corporation exceed its AMTI (deter-mined without the ACE adjustment and the alternative tax net operating loss deduc-tion). In determining ACE the following rules apply: 1. For property placed in service before 1994, depreciation generally is determined using the straight-line method and the class life determined under the alternative depre-ciation system. 2. Amounts excluded from gross income under the regular tax but included for pur-poses of determining earnings and profits are generally included in determining ACE. 3. The inside build-up of a life insurance contract is included in ACE (and the related premiums are deductible). 4. Intangible drilling costs of integrated oil companies must be capitalized and amor-tized over a 60-month period. 5. The regular tax rules of section 173 (al-lowing circulation expenses to be amortized) and section 248 (allowing organizational ex-penses to be amortized) do not apply. 6. Inventory must be calculated using the FIFO, rather than LIFO, method. 7. The installment sales method generally may not be used. 8. No loss may be recognized on the ex-change of any pool of debt obligations for an-other pool of debt obligations having sub-stantially the same effective interest rates and maturities. 9. Depletion (other than for oil and gas properties) must be calculated using the cost, rather than the percentage, method. 10. In certain cases, the assets of a corpora-tion that has undergone an ownership change must be stepped down to their fair market values. Other rules The taxpayer’s net operating loss carry-over generally cannot reduce the taxpayer’s AMT liability by more than 90 percent of AMTI determined without this deduction. The various nonrefundable business credits allowed under the regular tax generally are not allowed against the AMT. Certain excep-tions apply. If a corporation is subject to AMT in any year, the amount of AMT is allowed as an AMT credit in any subsequent taxable year to the extent the taxpayer’s regular tax li-ability exceeds its tentative minimum tax in the subsequent year. Corporations are al-lowed to claim a limited amount of AMT credits in lieu of bonus depreciation. A corporation may elect to write off cer-tain expenditures paid or incurred with re-spect of circulation expenses, research and experimental expenses, intangible drilling and development expenditures, development expenditures, and mining exploration ex-penditures over a specified period (three years in the case of circulation expenses, 60 months in the case of intangible drilling and development expenditures, and 10 years in case of other expenditures). The election ap-plies for purposes of both the regular tax and the alternative minimum tax 
HOUSE BILL  The House bill repeals the individual and corporate alternative minimum tax. The provision allows the AMT credit to off-set the taxpayer’s regular tax liability for any taxable year. In addition, the AMT cred-it is refundable for any taxable year begin-ning after 2018 and before 2023 in an amount equal to 50 percent (100 percent in the case of taxable years beginning in 2022) of the excess of the minimum tax credit for the taxable year over the amount of the credit allowable for the year against regular tax liability. Thus, the full amount of the minimum tax credit will be allowed in taxable years begin-ning before 2023. Effective date.—The provision is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. In determining the alternative minimum taxable income for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2018, the net operating loss

353Section 5000A. If an individual is a dependent, as defined in section 152, of another taxpayer, the other taxpayer is liable for any tax for failure to maintain the required coverage with respect to the individual. 
354Sec. 5000A(f). Minimum essential coverage does not include coverage that consists of only certain excepted benefits, such as limited scope dental and vision benefits or long-term care insurance offered under a separate policy, certificate or contract. 
355For years after 2016, the $695 amount is indexed to CPI–U, rounded to the next lowest multiple of $50.

360This amount is indexed for inflation. In the case that contributions to an ABLE account exceed the annual limit, an excise tax in the amount of six per-cent of the excess contribution to such account is imposed on the designated beneficiary. Such tax does not apply in the event that the trustee of such account makes a corrective distribution of such ex-cess amounts by the due date (including extensions) of the individual’s tax return for the year within the taxable year.

The repeal of the election to write off cer-tain expenditures over a specified period ap-plies to amounts paid or incurred after De-cember 31, 2017. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The Senate amendment temporarily in-creases both the exemption amount and the exemption amount phaseout thresholds for the individual AMT. Under the provision, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, and beginning before January 1, 2026, the AMT exemption amount is increased to $109,400 for married taxpayers filing a joint return (half this amount for married tax-payers filing a separate return), and $70,300 for all other taxpayers (other than estates and trusts). The phaseout thresholds are in-creased to $208,400 (half this amount for mar-ried taxpayers filing a separate return), and $156,300 for all other taxpayers (other than estates and trusts). These amounts are in-dexed for inflation. The provision does not change the cor-porate alternative minimum tax. Effective date.—The provision is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement temporarily in-creases both the exemption amount and the exemption amount phaseout thresholds for the individual AMT. Under the provision, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, and beginning before January 1, 2026, the AMT exemption amount is increased to $109,400 for married taxpayers filing a joint return (half this amount for married tax-payers filing a separate return), and $70,300 for all other taxpayers (other than estates and trusts). The phaseout thresholds are in-creased to $1,000,000 for married taxpayers filing a joint return, and $500,000 for all other taxpayers (other than estates and trusts). These amounts are indexed for inflation. The conference agreement follows the House bill in repealing the corporate alter-native minimum tax. In the case of a corporation, the conference agreement allows the AMT credit to offset the regular tax liability for any taxable year. In addition, the AMT credit is refund-able for any taxable year beginning after 2017 and before 2022 in an amount equal to 50 per-cent (100 percent in the case of taxable years beginning in 2021) of the excess of the min-imum tax credit for the taxable year over the amount of the credit allowable for the year against regular tax liability. Thus, the full amount of the minimum tax credit will be allowed in taxable years beginning before 2022. Effective date.—The provisions are effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. H. Elimination of Shared Responsibility Pay-ment for Individuals Failing to Maintain Minimal Essential Coverage (sec. 11081 of the Senate amendment and sec. 5000A of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  Under the Patient Protection and Afford-able Care Act
352(also called the Affordable Care Act, or ‘‘ACA’’), individuals must be covered by a health plan that provides at least minimum essential coverage or be sub-ject to a tax (also referred to as a penalty) for failure to maintain the coverage (com-monly referred to as the ‘‘individual man-date’’).
353Minimum essential coverage in-cludes government-sponsored programs (in-cluding Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP, among others), eligible employer-sponsored plans, plans in the individual market, grand-fathered group health plans and grand-fathered health insurance coverage, and other coverage as recognized by the Sec-retary of Health and Human Services (‘‘HHS’’) in coordination with the Secretary of the Treasury.354The tax is imposed for any month that an individual does not have minimum essential coverage unless the indi-vidual qualifies for an exemption for the month as described below. The tax for any calendar month is one- twelfth of the tax calculated as an annual amount. The annual amount is equal to the greater of a flat dollar amount or an excess income amount. The flat dollar amount is the lesser of (1) the sum of the individual an-nual dollar amounts for the members of the taxpayer’s family and (2) 300 percent of the adult individual dollar amount. The indi-vidual adult annual dollar amount is $695 for 2017 and 2018.
355For an individual who has not attained age 18, the individual annual dollar amount is one half of the adult amount. The excess income amount is 2.5 percent of the excess of the taxpayer’s house-hold income for the taxable year over the threshold amount of income for requiring the taxpayer to file an income tax return.
356 The total annual household payment may not exceed the national average annual pre-mium for bronze level health plans for the applicable family size offered through Ex-changes that year. Exemptions from the requirement to main-tain minimum essential coverage are pro-vided for the following: (1) an individual for whom coverage is unaffordable because the required contribution exceeds 8.16
357percent of household income, (2) an individual with household income below the income tax re-turn filing threshold, (3) a member of an In-dian tribe, (4) a member of certain recog-nized religious sects or a health sharing min-istry, (5) an individual with a coverage gap for a continuous period of less than three months, and (6) an individual who is deter-mined by the Secretary of HHS to have suf-fered a hardship with respect to the capa-bility to obtain coverage.
358 
HOUSE BILL  No provision. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The Senate amendment reduces the amount of the individual responsibility pay-ment, enacted as part of the Affordable Care Act, to zero. Effective date.—The provision is effective with respect to health coverage status for months beginning after December 31, 2018. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the Sen-ate amendment. I. Other Provisions 1. Temporarily allow increased contributions to ABLE accounts, and allow contribu-tions to be eligible for saver’s credit (sec. 11024 of the Senate amendment and sec. 529A of the Code) PRESENT LAW  Qualified ABLE programs The Code provides for a tax-favored savings program intended to benefit disabled individ-uals, known as qualified ABLE programs.
359 A qualified ABLE program is a program es-tablished and maintained by a State or agen-cy or instrumentality thereof. A qualified ABLE program must meet the following con-ditions: (1) under the provisions of the pro-gram, contributions may be made to an ac-count (an ‘‘ABLE account’’), established for the purpose of meeting the qualified dis-ability expenses of the designated bene-ficiary of the account; (2) the program must limit a designated beneficiary to one ABLE account; and (3) the program must meet cer-tain other requirements discussed below. A qualified ABLE program is generally exempt from income tax, but is otherwise subject to the taxes imposed on the unrelated business income of tax-exempt organizations. A designated beneficiary of an ABLE ac-count is the owner of the ABLE account. A designated beneficiary must be an eligible individual (defined below) who established the ABLE account and who is designated at the commencement of participation in the qualified ABLE program as the beneficiary of amounts paid (or to be paid) into and from the program. Contributions to an ABLE account must be made in cash and are not deductible for Fed-eral income tax purposes. Except in the case of a rollover contribution from another ABLE account, an ABLE account must pro-vide that it may not receive aggregate con-tributions during a taxable year in excess of the amount under section 2503(b) of the Code (the annual gift tax exemption). For 2017, this is $14,000.
360Additionally, a qualified ABLE program must provide adequate safe-guards to ensure that ABLE account con-tributions do not exceed the limit imposed on accounts under the qualified tuition pro-gram of the State maintaining the qualified ABLE program. Amounts in the account ac-cumulate on a tax-deferred basis (i.e., in-come on accounts under the program is not subject to current income tax). A qualified ABLE program may permit a designated beneficiary to direct (directly or indirectly) the investment of any contribu-tions (or earnings thereon) no more than two times in any calendar year and must provide separate accounting for each designated ben-eficiary. A qualified ABLE program may not allow any interest in the program (or any portion thereof) to be used as security for a loan. Distributions from an ABLE account are generally includible in the distributee’s in-come to the extent consisting of earnings on the account.
361Distributions from an ABLE account are excludable from income to the extent that the total distribution does not exceed the qualified disability expenses of

362For instance, if a designated beneficiary were to relocate to a different State. 
363In which case the contributor ABLE account must be closed 60 days after the transfer to the new ABLE account is made. 364These are benefits, respectively, under Title II or Title XVI of the Social Security Act.

If a distribution from an ABLE ac-count exceeds the qualified disability ex-penses of the designated beneficiary, a pro rata portion of the distribution is excludable from income. The portion of any distribution that is includible in income is subject to an additional 10-percent tax unless the distribu-tion is made after the death of the bene-ficiary. Amounts in an ABLE account may be rolled over without income tax liability to another ABLE account for the same bene-ficiary
362or another ABLE account for the designated beneficiary’s brother, sister, step-brother or stepsister who is also an eligible individual. Except in the case of an ABLE account es-tablished in a different ABLE program for purposes of transferring ABLE accounts,
363 no more than one ABLE account may be es-tablished by a designated beneficiary. Thus, once an ABLE account has been established by a designated beneficiary, no account sub-sequently established by such beneficiary shall be treated as an ABLE account. A contribution to an ABLE account is treated as a completed gift of a present in-terest to the designated beneficiary of the account. Such contributions qualify for the per-donee annual gift tax exclusion ($14,000 for 2017) and, to the extent of such exclusion, are exempt from the generation skipping transfer (‘‘GST’’) tax. A distribution from an ABLE account generally is not subject to gift tax or GST tax. Eligible individuals As described above, a qualified ABLE pro-gram may provide for the establishment of ABLE accounts only if those accounts are es-tablished and owned by an eligible indi-vidual, such owner referred to as a des-ignated beneficiary. For these purposes, an eligible individual is an individual either (1) for whom a disability certification has been filed with the Secretary for the taxable year, or (2) who is entitled to Social Security Dis-ability Insurance benefits or SSI benefits
364 based on blindness or disability, and such blindness or disability occurred before the individual attained age 26. A disability certification means a certifi-cation to the satisfaction of the Secretary, made by the eligible individual or the parent or guardian of the eligible individual, that the individual has a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, which re-sults in marked and severe functional limi-tations, and which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be ex-pected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months, or is blind (within the meaning of section 1614(a)(2) of the Social Security Act). Such blindness or disability must have occurred before the date the indi-vidual attained age 26. Such certification must include a copy of the diagnosis of the individual’s impairment and be signed by a licensed physician.365 Qualified disability expenses As described above, the earnings on dis-tributions from an ABLE account are ex-cluded from income only to the extent total distributions do not exceed the qualified dis-ability expenses of the designated bene-ficiary. For this purpose, qualified disability expenses are any expenses related to the eli-gible individual’s blindness or disability which are made for the benefit of the des-ignated beneficiary. Such expenses include the following expenses: education, housing, transportation, employment training and support, assistive technology and personal support services, health, prevention and wellness, financial management and admin-istrative services, legal fees, expenses for oversight and monitoring, funeral and burial expenses, and other expenses, which are ap-proved by the Secretary under regulations and consistent with the purposes of section 529A. Transfer to State In the event that the designated bene-ficiary dies, subject to any outstanding pay-ments due for qualified disability expenses incurred by the designated beneficiary, all amounts remaining in the deceased des-ignated beneficiary’s ABLE account not in excess of the amount equal to the total med-ical assistance paid such individual under any State Medicaid plan established under title XIX of the Social Security Act shall be distributed to such State upon filing of a claim for payment by such State. Such re-paid amounts shall be net of any premiums paid from the account or by or on behalf of the beneficiary to the State’s Medicaid Buy- In program. Treatment of ABLE accounts under Federal programs Any amounts in an ABLE account, and any distribution for qualified disability expenses, shall be disregarded for purposes of deter-mining eligibility to receive, or the amount of, any assistance or benefit authorized by any Federal means-tested program. However, in the case of the SSI program, a distribu-tion for housing expenses is not disregarded, nor are amounts in an ABLE account in ex-cess of $100,000. In the case that an individ-ual’s ABLE account balance exceeds $100,000, such individual’s SSI benefits shall not be terminated, but instead shall be suspended until such time as the individual’s resources fall below $100,000. However, such suspension shall not apply for purposes of Medicaid eli-gibility. Saver’s credit Present law provides a nonrefundable tax credit for eligible taxpayers for qualified re-tirement savings contributions.
366The max- imum annual contribution eligible for the credit is $2,000 per individual. The credit rate depends on the adjusted gross income (‘‘AGI’’) of the taxpayer. For this purpose, AGI is determined without regard to certain excludable foreign-source earned income and certain U.S. possession income. For taxable years beginning in 2017, mar-ried taxpayers filing joint returns with AGI of $61,500 or less, taxpayers filing head of household returns with AGI of $46,125 or less, and all other taxpayers filing returns with AGI of $30,750 or less are eligible for the cred-it. As the taxpayer’s AGI increases, the cred-it rate available to the taxpayer is reduced, until, at certain AGI levels, the credit is un-available. The credit rates based on AGI for taxable years beginning in 2016 are provided in the table below. The AGI levels used for the determination of the available credit rate are indexed for inflation.

The saver’s credit is in addition to any de-duction or exclusion that would otherwise apply with respect to the contribution. The credit offsets alternative minimum tax li-ability as well as regular tax liability. The credit is available to individuals who are 18 years old or older, other than individuals who are full-time students or claimed as a dependent on another taxpayer’s return. Qualified retirement savings contributions consist of (1) elective deferrals to a section 401(k) plan, a section 403(b) plan, a govern-mental section 457 plan, a SIMPLE plan, or a SARSEP; (2) contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA; and (3) voluntary after-tax em-ployee contributions to a qualified retire-ment plan or section 403(b) plan. Under the rules governing these arrangements, an indi-vidual’s contribution to the arrangement generally cannot exceed the lesser of an an-nual dollar amount (for example, in 2017, $5,500 in the case of an IRA of an individual under age 50) or the individual’s compensa-tion that is includible in income. In the case of IRA contributions of a married couple, the combined includible compensation of both spouses may be taken into account. The amount of any contribution eligible for the credit is reduced by distributions re-ceived by the taxpayer (or by the taxpayer’s spouse if the taxpayer files a joint return with the spouse) from any retirement plan to which eligible contributions can be made during the taxable year for which the credit is claimed, during the two taxable years prior to the year for which the credit is claimed, and during the period after the end of the taxable year for which the credit is claimed and prior to the due date (including extensions) for filing the taxpayer’s return for the year. Distributions that are rolled over to another retirement plan do not affect the credit. 
HOUSE BILL  No provision. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The Senate amendment temporarily in-creases the contribution limitation to ABLE accounts under certain circumstances. While the general overall limitation on contribu-tions (the per-donee annual gift tax exclu-sion ($14,000 for 2017)) remains the same, the limitation is temporarily increased with re-spect to contributions made by the des-ignated beneficiary of the ABLE account. Under the temporary provision, after the overall limitation on contributions is reached, an ABLE account’s designated bene-ficiary may contribute an additional amount, up to the lesser of (a) the Federal poverty line for a one-person household; or

PRESENT LAW  The IRS is authorized to return property that has been wrongfully levied upon.
367In general, monetary proceeds from the sale of levied property may be returned within nine months of the date of the levy. Generally, any person (other than the per-son against whom is assessed the tax out of which such levy arose) who claims an inter-est in levied property and that such property was wrongfully levied upon may bring a civil action for wrongful levy in a district court of the United States.
368Generally, an action for wrongful levy must be brought within nine months from the date of levy.

HOUSE BILL  No provision. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The provision extends from nine months to two years the period for returning the mone-tary proceeds from the sale of property that has been wrongfully levied upon. The provision also extends from nine months to two years the period for bringing a civil action for wrongful levy. Effective date.—The provision is effective with respect to: (1) levies made after the date of enactment; and (2) levies made on or be-fore the date of enactment provided that the nine-month period has not expired as of the date of enactment.

375 
HOUSE BILL  No provision. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The provision grants combat zone tax ben-efits to the Sinai Peninsula of Egypt, if as of the date of enactment of the provision any member of the Armed Forces of the United States is entitled to special pay under sec-tion 310 of title 37, United States Code (relat-ing to special pay; duty subject to hostile fire or imminent danger), for services per-formed in such location. This benefit lasts only during the period such entitlement is in effect but not later than taxable years begin-ning before January 1, 2026. Effective date.—The provision is generally effective beginning June 9, 2015. The portion of the provision related to wage withholding applies to remuneration paid after the date of enactment. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the Sen-ate amendment. 4. Modifications of user fees requirements for installment agreements (sec. 11073 of the Senate amendment and new sec. 6159(f) of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  The Code authorizes the IRS to enter into written agreements with any taxpayer under which the taxpayer agrees to pay taxes owed, as well as interest and penalties, in install-ments over an agreed schedule, if the IRS de-termines that doing so will facilitate collec-tion of the amounts owed. This agreement provides for a period during which payments may be made and while other IRS enforce-ment actions are held in abeyance.
376An in- stallment agreement generally does not re-duce the amount of taxes, interest, or pen-alties owed. However, the IRS is authorized to enter into installment agreements with taxpayers which do not provide for full pay-ment of the taxpayer’s liability over the life of the agreement. The IRS is required to re-view such partial payment installment agreements at least every two years to de-termine whether the financial condition of the taxpayer has significantly changed so as to warrant an increase in the value of the payments being made. Taxpayers can request an installment agreement by filing Form 9465, Installment Agreement Request.
377If the request for an installment agreement is approved by the IRS, the IRS charges a user fee.
378The IRS currently charges $225 for entering into an installment agreement.
379If the application is for a direct debit installment agreement, whereby the taxpayer authorizes the IRS to request the monthly electronic transfer of funds from the taxpayer’s bank account to the IRS, the fee is reduced to $107.
380In addi-tion, regardless of the method of payment, the fee is $43 for low-income taxpayers.381 For this purpose, low-income is defined as a person who falls below 250 percent of the Federal poverty guidelines published annu-ally. Finally, there is no user fee if the agreement qualifies for a short term agree-ment (120 days or less). 
HOUSE BILL  No provision. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The provision generally prohibits increases in the amount of user fees charged by the IRS for installment agreements. For low-in-come taxpayers (those whose income falls below 250 percent of the Federal poverty guidelines), it alleviates the user fee require-ment in two ways. First, it waives the user fee if the low-income taxpayer enters into an installment agreement under which the tax-payer agrees to make automated installment payments through a debit account. Second, it provides that low-income taxpayers who are unable to agree to make payments elec-tronically remain subject to the required user fee, but the fee is reimbursed upon com-pletion of the installment agreement. Effective date.—The provision is effective for agreements entered into on or after the date that is 60 days after the date of enact-ment. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement does not include the Senate amendment provision. 5. Relief for 2016 disaster areas (sec. 11029 of the Senate amendment and secs. 72(t), 165, 401–403, 408, 457, and 3405 of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  Distributions from tax-favored retirement plans A distribution from a qualified retirement plan, a tax-sheltered annuity plan (a ‘‘sec-tion 403(b) plan’’), an eligible deferred com-pensation plan of a State or local govern-ment employer (a ‘‘governmental section 457(b) plan’’), or an individual retirement ar-rangement (an ‘‘IRA’’) generally is included in income for the year distributed.
382These plans are referred to collectively as ‘‘eligible retirement plans.’’ In addition, unless an ex-ception applies, a distribution from a quali-fied retirement plan, a section 403(b) plan, or an IRA received before age 59
1⁄2is subject to a 10-percent additional tax (referred to as the ‘‘early withdrawal tax’’) on the amount in-cludible in income.
383 In general, a distribution from an eligible retirement plan may be rolled over to an-other eligible retirement plan within 60 days, in which case the amount rolled over gen-erally is not includible in income. The IRS has the authority to waive the 60-day re-quirement if failure to waive the require-ment would be against equity or good con-science, including cases of casualty, disaster or other events beyond the reasonable con-trol of the individual. The terms of a qualified retirement plan, section 403(b) plan, or governmental section 457(b) plan generally determine when dis-tributions are permitted. However, in some

Despite such restrictions, an in-service distribution may be permitted in the case of financial hardship or an unforeseeable emer-gency. Tax-favored retirement plans are generally required to be operated in accordance with the terms of the plan document, and amend-ments to reflect changes to the plan gen-erally must be adopted within a limited pe-riod. Itemized deduction for casualty losses A taxpayer may generally claim a deduc-tion for any loss sustained during the tax-able year and not compensated by insurance or otherwise.
384For individual taxpayers, de-ductible losses must be incurred in a trade or business or other profit-seeking activity or consist of property losses arising from fire, storm, shipwreck, or other casualty, or from theft. Personal casualty or theft losses are deductible only if they exceed $100 per cas-ualty or theft. In addition, aggregate net casualty and theft losses are deductible only to the extent they exceed 10 percent of an in-dividual taxpayer’s adjusted gross income. 
HOUSE BILL  No provision. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  In general The provision provides tax relief, as de-scribed below, relating to a ‘‘2016 disaster area,’’ defined as any area with respect to which a major disaster was declared by the President under section 401 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency As-sistance Act during calendar year 2016. Distributions from eligible retirement plans Under the provision, an exception to the 10-percent early withdrawal tax applies in the case of a qualified 2016 disaster distribu-tion from a qualified retirement plan, a sec-tion 403(b) plan or an IRA. In addition, as discussed further, income attributable to a qualified 2016 disaster distribution may be included in income ratably over three years, and the amount of a qualified 2016 disaster distribution may be recontributed to an eli-gible retirement plan within three years. A qualified 2016 disaster distribution is a distribution from an eligible retirement plan made on or after January 1, 2016, and before January 1, 2018, to an individual whose prin-cipal place of abode at any time during cal-endar year 2016 was located in a 2016 disaster area and who has sustained an economic loss by reason of the events giving rise to the Presidential disaster declaration. The total amount of distributions to an in-dividual from all eligible retirement plans that may be treated as qualified 2016 disaster distributions is $100,000. Thus, any distribu-tions in excess of $100,000 during the applica-ble period are not qualified 2016 disaster dis-tributions. Any amount required to be included in in-come as a result of a qualified 2016 disaster is included in income ratably over the three- year period beginning with the year of dis-tribution unless the individual elects not to have ratable inclusion apply. Any portion of a qualified 2016 disaster dis-tribution may, at any time during the three- year period beginning the day after the date on which the distribution was received, be recontributed to an eligible retirement plan to which a rollover can be made. Any amount recontributed within the three-year period is treated as a rollover and thus is not includible in income. For example, if an indi-vidual receives a qualified 2016 disaster dis-tribution in 2016, that amount is included in income, generally ratably over the year of the distribution and the following two years, but is not subject to the 10-percent early withdrawal tax. If, in 2018, the amount of the qualified 2016 disaster distribution is re-contributed to an eligible retirement plan, the individual may file an amended return to claim a refund of the tax attributable to the amount previously included in income. In addition, if, under the ratable inclusion pro-vision, a portion of the distribution has not yet been included in income at the time of the contribution, the remaining amount is not includible in income. A qualified 2016 disaster distribution is a permissible distribution from a qualified re-tirement plan, section 403(b) plan, or govern-mental section 457(b) plan, regardless of whether a distribution otherwise would be permissible.385A plan is not treated as vio-lating any Code requirement merely because it treats a distribution as a qualified 2016 dis-aster distribution, provided that the aggre-gate amount of such distributions from plans maintained by the employer and members of the employer’s controlled group or affiliated service group does not exceed $100,000. Thus, a plan is not treated as violating any Code requirement merely because an individual might receive total distributions in excess of $100,000, taking into account distributions from plans of other employers or IRAs. A plan amendment made pursuant to the provision (or a regulation issued thereunder) may be retroactively effective if, in addition to the requirements described below, the amendment is made on or before the last day of the first plan year beginning after Decem-ber 31, 2018 (or in the case of a governmental plan, December 31, 2020), or a later date pre-scribed by the Secretary. In addition, the plan will be treated as operated in accord-ance with plan terms during the period be-ginning with the date the provision or regu-lation takes effect (or the date specified by the plan if the amendment is not required by the provision or regulation) and ending on the last permissible date for the amendment (or, if earlier, the date the amendment is adopted). In order for an amendment to be retroactively effective, it must apply retro-actively for that period, and the plan must be operated in accordance with the amend-ment during that period. Modification of rules related to casualty losses Under the provision, in the case of a per-sonal casualty loss which arose on or after January 1, 2016, in a 2016 disaster area and was attributable to the events giving rise to the Presidential disaster declaration, such losses are deductible without regard to whether aggregate net losses exceed ten per-cent of a taxpayer’s adjusted gross income. Under the provision, in order to be deduct-ible, the losses must exceed $500 per cas-ualty. Additionally, such losses may be claimed in addition to the standard deduc-tion. Effective date.—The provision is effective on the date of enactment. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the Sen-ate amendment with a clarification that cas-ualty loss relief applies to losses arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2015, and before January 1, 2018. 6. Attorneys’ fees relating to awards to whis-tleblowers (sec. 11078 of the Senate amendment and sec. 62(a)(21) of the Code) PRESENT LAW  The Code provides an above-the-line deduc-tion for attorneys’ fees and costs paid by, or on behalf of, the taxpayer in connection with any action involving a claim of unlawful dis-crimination, certain claims against the Fed-eral Government, or a private cause of ac-tion under the Medicare Secondary Payer statute.
386The amount that may be deducted above-the-line may not exceed the amount includible in the taxpayer’s gross income for the taxable year on account of a judgment or settlement (whether by suit or agreement and whether as lump sum or periodic pay-ments) resulting from such claim. Addition-ally, the Code provides an above-the-line de-duction for attorneys’ fees and costs paid by, or on behalf of, the individual in connection with any award for providing information re-garding violations of the tax laws.
387The amount that may be deducted above-the-line may not exceed the amount includible in the taxpayer’s gross income for the taxable year on account of such award.
388 
HOUSE BILL  No provision. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The provision provides an above-the-line deduction for attorney fees and court costs paid by, or on behalf of, the taxpayer in con-nection with any action involving a claim under State False Claim Acts, the SEC whis-tleblower program,
389and the Commodity Future Trading Commission whistleblower program.

CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement does not include the Senate amendment provision. 7. Clarification of whistleblower awards (sec. 11079 of the Senate amendment and new sec. 7623(c) of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  Awards to whistleblowers The Code authorizes the IRS to pay such sums as deemed necessary for: ‘‘(1) detecting underpayments of tax; or (2) detecting and bringing to trial and punishment persons guilty of violating the internal revenue laws or conniving at the same.’’
391Generally, amounts are paid based on a percentage of proceeds collected based on the information provided. The Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 (the ‘‘Act’’)
392established an enhanced re-ward program for actions in which the tax, penalties, interest, additions to tax, and ad-ditional amounts in dispute exceed $2,000,000 and, if the taxpayer is an individual, the in-dividual’s gross income exceeds $200,000 for any taxable year in issue. In such cases, the award is calculated to be at least 15 percent

The Act permits an individual to appeal the amount or a denial of an award deter-mination to the United States Tax Court (the ‘‘Tax Court’’) within 30 days of such de-termination. Tax Court review of an award determination may be assigned to a special trial judge. Rules relating to taxpayers with foreign as-sets U.S. persons who transfer assets to, and hold interests in, foreign bank accounts or foreign entities may be subject to self-re-porting requirements under both the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act provisions in the Code and the provisions in the Bank Se-crecy Act and its underlying regulations (which provide for FinCEN Form 114, Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts, the ‘‘FBAR’’), as discussed below. Amounts re-covered for violations of FATCA provisions in the Code may be considered for purposes of computing a whistleblower award under the Code. However, the IRS has found that amounts recovered for violations of non-tax laws, including the provisions of the Bank Secrecy Act (and FBAR) for which the IRS has delegated authority, may not be consid-ered for purposes of computing an award under the Code.
393 Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (‘‘FATCA’’) The Code imposes a withholding and re-porting regime for U.S. persons engaged in foreign activities, directly or indirectly, through a foreign business entity.
394This re- gime for outbound payments,
395commonly referred to as the Foreign Account Tax Com-pliance Act (‘‘FATCA’’),
396imposes a with-holding tax of 30 percent of the gross amount of certain payments to foreign financial in-stitutions (‘‘FFIs’’) unless the FFI estab-lishes that it is compliant with the informa-tion reporting requirements of FATCA which include identifying certain U.S. accounts held in the FFI. An FFI must report with re-spect to a U.S. account (1) the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of each U.S. person holding an account or a foreign entity with one or more substantial U.S. owners holding an account; (2) the account number; (3) the account balance or value; and (4) except as provided by the Secretary, the gross receipts, including from dividends and interest, and gross withdrawals or pay-ments from the account.
397 Individuals are required to disclose with their annual Federal income tax return any interest in foreign accounts and certain for-eign securities if the aggregate value of such assets is in excess of the greater of $50,000 or an amount determined by the Secretary in regulations. Failure to do so is punishable by a penalty of $10,000, which may increase for each 30-day period during which the failure continues after notification by the IRS, up to a maximum penalty of $50,000.398 Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Ac-counts (the ‘‘FBAR’’) In addition to the reporting requirements under the Code, U.S. persons who transfer as-sets to, and hold interests in, foreign bank accounts or foreign entities may be subject to self-reporting requirements under the Bank Secrecy Act.
399 The Bank Secrecy Act imposes reporting obligations on both financial institutions and account holders. With respect to account holders, a U.S. citizen, resident, or person doing business in the United States is re-quired to keep records and file reports, as specified by the Secretary, when that person enters into a transaction or maintains an ac-count with a foreign financial agency.
400 Regulations promulgated pursuant to broad regulatory authority granted to the Sec-retary in the Bank Secrecy Act
401provide additional guidance regarding the disclosure obligation with respect to foreign accounts. The FBAR must be filed by June 30
402of the year following the year in which the $10,000 filing threshold is met.
403Failure to file the FBAR is subject to both criminal
404 and civil penalties.
405Willful failure to file an FBAR may be subject to penalties in amounts not to exceed the greater of $100,000 or 50 percent of the amount in the account at the time of the violation.
406A non-willful, but negligent, failure to file is subject to a penalty of $10,000 for each negligent viola-tion.
407The penalty may be waived if (1) there is reasonable cause for the failure to report and (2) the amount of the transaction or balance in the account was properly re-ported. In addition, serious violations are subject to criminal prosecution, potentially resulting in both monetary penalties and im-prisonment. Civil and criminal sanctions are not mutually exclusive. FBAR enforcement responsibility Until 2003, the Financial Crimes Enforce-ment Network (‘‘FinCEN’’), an agency of the Department of the Treasury, had exclusive responsibility for civil penalty enforcement of FBAR, although administration of the FBAR reporting regime was delegated to the IRS.408As a result, persons who were more than 180 days delinquent in paying any FBAR penalties were referred for collection action to the Financial Management Service of the Treasury Department, which is re-sponsible for such non-tax collections.
409 Continued nonpayment resulted in a referral to the Department of Justice for institution of court proceedings against the delinquent person. In 2003, the Secretary delegated FBAR civil enforcement authority to the IRS.
410The authority delegated to the IRS in 2003 included the authority to determine and enforce civil penalties,
411as well as to revise the form and instructions. However, the Bank Secrecy Act does not include collec-tion powers similar to those available for en-forcement of the tax laws under the Code. As a consequence, FBAR civil penalties remain collectible only in accord with the proce-dures for non-tax collection described above. FBAR and awards to whistleblowers Recent cases have considered FBAR pen-alties in connection with IRS whistleblower awards.
412One case analyzed the provision dealing with ‘‘additional amounts in dis-pute’’ and linked that concept to amounts assessed and collected under the Code which FBAR is not.
413The issue was whether FBAR penalties constituted ‘‘additional amounts’’ for purposes of determining whether ‘‘addi-tional amounts in dispute exceed $2,000,000.’’ The case was disposed on summary judgment on the grounds that FBAR penalties are not assessed, collected or paid in the same man-ner as taxes. As such, they are not additional amounts in dispute and therefore the thresh-old was not exceeded. Notably, the court sug-gested that the petitioner present its policy arguments to Congress based on the fact that the connection between FBAR and tax enforcement justified the Secretary to re-delegate FBAR administrative authority to the IRS.
414 Another case dealt with the provision ‘‘col-lected proceeds’’ and held that the term is not limited to amounts assessed and col-lected under Title 26.
415The issue in the case was whether payments of a criminal fine and civil forfeitures constitute collected pro-ceeds. The criminal fine was imposed under Title 18 as a result of guilty plea to conspiring to defraud the IRS, file false Federal income tax returns, and evade Federal income taxes.

The money was forfeited pursuant to Title 18. The IRS argued that criminal fines and forfeitures are not collected proceeds be-cause only amounts assessed and collected under Title 26 can be used to pay a whistle-blower award. The IRS also argued that a criminal fine collected by the Government cannot be considered collected proceeds be-cause (1) pursuant to 42 U.S.C. sec. 10601 all criminal fines collected from persons con-victed of offenses against the United States are to be deposited in the Crime Victims Fund; (2) criminal fines are paid by the tax-payer directly to the imposing court, which in turn deposits them into the Crime Vic-tims Fund; and (3) at no time are criminal fines available to the Secretary. The court said that the Code did not refer to, or re-quire, the availability of funds to be used in making an award.
416 Petitioners said the payment resulted from action taken by Secretary and relates to acts committed by taxpayer in violation of Title 26 provisions. The court agreed and held that collected proceeds are not limited to amounts assessed and collected under Title 26. In reaching its holding it referenced Whistleblower 22716–13W v. Commissioner , dis- cussed above and noted there is no inconsist-ency because the issue there was about whether the threshold of $2,000,000 was ex-ceeded. It is not clear whether FBAR pen-alties would be included under their holding because in the case, the taxpayer did violate Title 26 (even if the penalties were imposed under Title 18). 
HOUSE BILL  No provision. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  Under the provision, collected proceeds eli-gible for awards under the Code are defined to include: (1) penalties, interest, additions to tax, and additional amounts and (2) any proceeds under enforcement programs that the Treasury has delegated to the IRS the authority to administer, enforce, or inves-tigate, including criminal fines and civil for-feitures, and violations of reporting require-ments. This definition is also used to deter-mine eligibility for the enhanced reward pro-gram under which proceeds and additional amounts in dispute exceed $2,000,000. The collected proceeds amounts are deter-mined without regard to whether such pro-ceeds are available to the Secretary. Effective date.—The provision is effective for information provided before, on, or after date of enactment with respect to which a final determination has not been made be-fore such date. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement does not include the Senate amendment provision. 8. Exclusion from gross income of certain amounts received by wrongly incarcer-ated individuals (sec. 11027 of the Senate amendment and sec. 139F of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  Under a provision added in the PATH Act,
417with respect to any wrongfully incar-cerated individual, gross income does not in-clude any civil damages, restitution, or other monetary award (including compen-satory or statutory damages and restitution imposed in a criminal matter) relating to the incarceration of such individual for the covered offense for which such individual was convicted.
418 A wrongfully incarcerated individual means an individual: (1) who was convicted of a covered of-fense; (2) who served all or part of a sentence of imprisonment relating to that covered of-fense; and (3) (i) was pardoned, granted clemency, or granted amnesty for such offense because the individual was innocent, or (ii) for whom the judgment of conviction for the offense was reversed or vacated, and whom the indictment, information, or other accusatory instrument for that covered of-fense was dismissed or who was found not guilty at a new trial after the judgment of conviction for that covered offense was re-versed or vacated. For these purposes, a covered offense is any criminal offense under Federal or State law, and includes any criminal offense aris-ing from the same course of conduct as that criminal offense. The Code contains a special rule allowing individuals to make a claim for credit or re-fund of any overpayment of tax resulting from the exclusion, even if such claim would be disallowed under the Code or by operation of any law or rule of law (including res judi- cata), if the claim for credit or refund is filed before the close of the one-year period begin-ning on the date of enactment of the PATH Act (December 18, 2015).419 
HOUSE BILL  No provision. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The Senate amendment would extend the waiver on the statute of limitations with re-spect to filing a claim for a credit or refund of an overpayment of tax resulting from the exclusion described above for an additional year. Thus, under the provision, such claim for credit or refund must be filed before De-cember 18, 2017. Effective date.—The provision is effective on the date of enactment. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement does not include the Senate amendment provision. BUSINESS TAX REFORM A. Tax Rates 1. Reduction in corporate tax rate (sec. 3001 of the House bill, secs. 13001 and 13002 of the Senate amendment, and secs. 11 and 243 of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  In general Corporate taxable income is subject to tax under a four-step graduated rate structure.
420 The top corporate tax rate is 35 percent on taxable income in excess of $10 million. The corporate taxable income brackets and tax rates are as set forth in the table below. 
Taxable Income Tax rate (percent) 
Not over $50,000 ................................................... 15 Over $50,000 but not over $75,000 ...................... 25 Over $75,000 but not over $10,000,000 ............... 34 Over $10,000,000 .................................................. 35 
An additional five-percent tax is imposed on a corporation’s taxable income in excess of $100,000. The maximum additional tax is $11,750. Also, a second additional three-per-cent tax is imposed on a corporation’s tax-able income in excess of $15 million. The maximum second additional tax is $100,000. Certain personal service corporations pay tax on their entire taxable income at the rate of 35 percent.
421 Present law provides that, if the maximum corporate tax rate exceeds 35 percent, the maximum rate on a corporation’s net capital gain will be 35 percent.422 Dividends received deduction Corporations are allowed a deduction with respect to dividends received from other tax-able domestic corporations.
423The amount of the deduction is generally equal to 70 per-cent of the dividend received. In the case of any dividend received from a 20-percent owned corporation, the amount of the deduction is equal to 80 percent of the dividend received.
424The term 20-percent owned corporation’’ means any corporation if 20 percent or more of the stock of such corporation (by vote and value) is owned by the taxpayer. For this purpose, certain preferred stock is not taken into account. In the case of a dividend received from a corporation that is a member of the same af-filiated group, a corporation is generally al-lowed a deduction equal to 100 percent of the dividend received.
425 
HOUSE BILL  The provision eliminates the graduated corporate rate structure and instead taxes corporate taxable income at 20 percent. Personal service corporations are taxed at 25 percent. The provision repeals the maximum cor-porate tax rate on net capital gain as obso-lete. The provision reduces the 70 percent divi-dends received deduction to 50 percent and the 80 percent dividends received deduction to 65 percent.
426 For taxpayers subject to the normalization method of accounting (e.g., regulated public utilities), the provision provides for the nor-malization of excess deferred tax reserves re-sulting from the reduction of corporate in-come tax rates (with respect to prior depre-ciation or recovery allowances taken on as-sets placed in service before the date of en-actment). Effective date.—The provision applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The Senate amendment follows the House bill, but does not provide a special rate for personal service corporations. Effective date.—The provision applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2018. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the Sen-ate amendment, but provides for a 21-percent corporate rate effective for taxable years be-ginning after December 31, 2017. In addition, for taxpayers subject to the normalization method of accounting ( e.g., regulated public utilities), the conference agreement clarifies the normalization of ex-cess tax reserves resulting from the reduc-tion of corporate income tax rates (with re-spect to prior depreciation or recovery al-lowances taken on assets placed in service before the corporate rate reduction takes ef-fect). The excess tax reserve is the reserve for de-ferred taxes as of the day before the cor-porate rate reduction takes effect over what

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH10034 December 15, 2017 
427Section 168(f)(2) and (i)(9)(C) provide that if a taxpayer is required to use a normalization method of accounting with respect to public utility property and does not do so, such taxpayer must compute its depreciation allowances for Federal income tax pur-poses using the depreciation method, useful life de-termination, averaging convention, and salvage value limitation used for purposes of setting rates and reflecting operating results in its regulated books of account. 
428See section 2.04 of Rev. Proc. 88–12, 1988–1 C.B. 637. 
429The 5-year tax and 10-year book lives are used for illustration purposes only. In general, public utility property may be depreciated over various pe-riods ranging from 5 to 20 years under MACRS. For regulatory purposes, public utility property may, in certain cases, have a useful life of 30 years or more. 
430The excess tax reserve of $4.5 million is equal to the cumulative deferred tax reserve as of December 31, 2017 ($11.2 million) minus the cumulative timing difference as of December 31, 2017 ($32 million) mul-tiplied by 21 percent. 
431See secs. 263(a) and 167. However, where prop-erty is not used exclusively in a taxpayer’s business, the amount eligible for a deduction must be reduced by the amount related to personal use. See, e.g., sec- tion 280A. 
432The applicable recovery period for an asset is determined in part by statute and in part by historic Treasury guidance. Exercising authority granted by Congress, the Secretary issued Rev. Proc. 87–56, 1987– 2 C.B. 674, laying out the framework of recovery pe-riods for enumerated classes of assets. The Sec-retary clarified and modified the list of asset classes in Rev. Proc. 88–22, 1988–1 C.B. 785. In November 1988, Congress revoked the Secretary’s authority to mod-ify the class lives of depreciable property. Rev. Proc. 87–56, as modified, remains in effect except to the ex-tent that the Congress has, since 1988, statutorily modified the recovery period for certain depreciable assets, effectively superseding any administrative guidance with regard to such property. 
433Sec. 168. 
434As defined in section 168(k)(2)(B). 
435As defined in section 168(k)(2)(C). 
436Sec. 168(k). The additional first-year deprecia-tion deduction is generally subject to the rules re-garding whether a cost must be capitalized under section 263A. 
437It is intended that for longer production period property placed in service in 2018, 50 percent applies to the entire adjusted basis. Similarly, for longer production period property placed in service in 2019, 40 percent applies to the entire adjusted basis. A technical correction may be necessary with respect to longer production period property placed in serv-ice in 2018 and 2019 so that the statute reflects this intent. 
438In the case of longer production period property described in section 168(k)(2)(B) and placed in serv-ice in 2020, 30 percent applies to the adjusted basis attributable to manufacture, construction, or pro-duction before January 1, 2020, and the remaining adjusted basis does not qualify for bonus deprecia-tion. Thirty percent applies to the entire adjusted basis of certain aircraft described in section 168(k)(2)(C) and placed in service in 2020. 
439Sec. 168(k)(2)(G). See also Treas. Reg. sec. 1.168(k)–1(d). 
440Sec. 312(k)(3) and Treas. Reg. sec. 1.168(k)–1(f)(7). 
441Sec. 168(k)(1)(B). 
442Ibid. 
443Sec. 168(k)(7). For the definition of a class of property, see Treas. Reg. sec. 1.168(k)–1(e)(2). 
444Assume that the cost of the property is not eli-gible for expensing under section 179 or Treas. Reg. sec. 1.263(a)–1(f). the reserve for deferred taxes would be if the corporate rate reduction had been in effect for all prior periods. If an excess tax reserve is reduced more rapidly or to a greater ex-tent than such reserve would be reduced under the average rate assumption method, the taxpayer will not be treated as using a normalization method with respect to the corporate rate reduction. If the taxpayer does not use a normalization method of ac-counting for the corporate rate reduction, the taxpayer’s tax for the taxable year shall be increased by the amount by which it re-duces its excess tax reserve more rapidly than permitted under a normalization meth-od of accounting and the taxpayer will not be treated as using a normalization method of accounting for purposes of section 168(f)(2) and (i)(9)(C).
427 The average rate assumption method428re- duces the excess tax reserve over the remain-ing regulatory lives of the property that gave rise to the reserve for deferred taxes during the years in which the deferred tax reserve related to such property is reversing. Under this method, the excess tax reserve is reduced as the timing differences ( i.e., dif- ferences between tax depreciation and regu-latory depreciation with respect to the prop-erty) reverse over the remaining life of the asset. The reversal of timing differences gen-erally occurs when the amount of the tax de-preciation taken with respect to an asset is less than the amount of the regulatory de-preciation taken with respect to the asset. To ensure that the deferred tax reserve, in-cluding the excess tax reserve, is reduced to zero at the end of the regulatory life of the asset that generated the reserve, the amount of the timing difference which reverses dur-ing a taxable year is multiplied by the ratio of (1) the aggregate deferred taxes as of the beginning of the period in question to (2) the aggregate timing differences for the property as of the beginning of the period in question. The following example illustrates the ap-plication of the average rate assumption method. A calendar year regulated utility placed property costing $100 million in serv-ice in 2016. For regulatory (book) purposes, the property is depreciated over 10 years on a straight line basis with a full year’s allow-ance in the first year. For tax purposes, the property is depreciated over 5 years using the 200 percent declining balance method and a half-year placed in service convention.

The excess tax reserve as of December 31, 2017, the day before the corporate rate reduc-tion takes effect, is $4.5 million.
430The tax- payer will begin taking the excess tax re-serve into account in the 2021 taxable year, which is the first year in which the tax de-preciation taken with respect to the prop-erty is less than the depreciation reflected in the regulated books of account. The annual adjustment to the deferred tax reserve for the 2021 through 2025 taxable years is multi-plied by 31.1 percent which is the ratio of the aggregate deferred taxes as of the beginning of 2021 ($13.8 million) to the aggregate timing differences for the property as of the begin-ning of 2021 ($44.2 million). Effective date.—The provision applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. B. Cost Recovery 1. Increased expensing (sec. 3101 of the House bill, secs. 13201 and 13311 of the Senate amendment, and sec. 168(k) of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  A taxpayer generally must capitalize the cost of property used in a trade or business or held for the production of income and re-cover such cost over time through annual de-ductions for depreciation or amortization.431 Tangible property Tangible property generally is depreciated under the modified accelerated cost recovery system (‘‘MACRS’’), which determines depre-ciation for different types of property based on an assigned applicable depreciation meth-od, recovery period,
432and convention.433 Bonus depreciation An additional first-year depreciation de-duction is allowed equal to 50 percent of the adjusted basis of qualified property acquired and placed in service before January 1, 2020 (January 1, 2021, for longer production period property
434and certain aircraft435).436The 50- percent allowance is phased down for prop-erty placed in service after December 31, 2017 (after December 31, 2018 for longer produc-tion period property and certain aircraft). The bonus depreciation percentage rates are as follows. 
Placed in Service Year Bonus Depreciation Percentage Qualified Property in General Longer Production Pe-riod Property and Certain Aircraft 
2017 ............................. 50 percent ................... 50 percent Placed in Service Year Bonus Depreciation Percentage Qualified Property in General Longer Production Pe-riod Property and Certain Aircraft 2018 ............................. 40 percent ................... 50 percent437 2019 ............................. 30 percent ................... 40 percent 2020 ............................. None ............................. 30 percent
438 
The additional first-year depreciation de-duction is allowed for both the regular tax and the alternative minimum tax (‘‘AMT’’),
439but is not allowed in computing earnings and profits.
440The basis of the prop-erty and the depreciation allowances in the year of purchase and later years are appro-priately adjusted to reflect the additional first-year depreciation deduction.
441The amount of the additional first-year deprecia-tion deduction is not affected by a short tax-able year.
442The taxpayer may elect out of the additional first-year depreciation for any class of property for any taxable year.
443 The interaction of the additional first-year depreciation allowance with the otherwise applicable depreciation allowance may be il-lustrated as follows. Assume that in 2017 a taxpayer purchases new depreciable property and places it in service.
444The property’s cost is $10,000, and it is five-year property

445$1,000 results from the application of the half- year convention and the 200 percent declining bal-ance method to the remaining $5,000. 
446Requirements relating to actions taken before 2008 are not described herein since they have little (if any) remaining effect. 
447As defined in section 168(e)(5). 
448The additional first-year depreciation deduction is not available for any property that is required to be depreciated under the alternative depreciation system of MACRS. Sec. 168(k)(2)(D)(i). 
449The term ‘‘original use’’ means the first use to which the property is put, whether or not such use corresponds to the use of such property by the tax-payer. If in the normal course of its business a tax-payer sells fractional interests in property to unre-lated third parties, then the original use of such property begins with the first user of each fractional interest (i.e., each fractional owner is considered the original user of its proportionate share of the prop-erty). Treas. Reg. sec. 1.168(k)–1(b)(3). 
450A special rule applies in the case of certain leased property. In the case of any property that is originally placed in service by a person and that is sold to the taxpayer and leased back to such person by the taxpayer within three months after the date that the property was placed in service, the property would be treated as originally placed in service by the taxpayer not earlier than the date that the prop-erty is used under the leaseback. If property is origi-nally placed in service by a lessor, such property is sold within three months after the date that the property was placed in service, and the user of such property does not change, then the property is treat-ed as originally placed in service by the taxpayer not earlier than the date of such sale. Sec. 168(k)(2)(E)(ii) and (iii). 
451Property qualifying for the extended placed-in- service date must have an estimated production pe-riod exceeding one year and a cost exceeding $1 mil-lion. Transportation property generally is defined as tangible personal property used in the trade or busi-ness of transporting persons or property. Certain aircraft which is not transportation property, other than for agricultural or firefighting uses, also quali-fies for the extended placed-in-service date, if at the time of the contract for purchase, the purchaser made a nonrefundable deposit of the lesser of 10 per-cent of the cost or $100,000, and which has an esti-mated production period exceeding four months and a cost exceeding $200,000. 452Sec. 168(k)(2)(E)(i).

458For this purpose, bonus depreciation is the dif-ference between (i) the aggregate amount of depre-ciation determined if section 168(k)(1) applied to all qualified property placed in service during the tax-able year and (ii) the amount of depreciation that would be so determined if section 168(k)(1) did not so apply. This determination is made using the most accelerated depreciation method and the shortest life otherwise allowable for each property. 459Sec. 168(k)(4)(B)(iii).

465Any amount deducted under this election is not subject to capitalization under section 263A. 
466A specified plant does not include any property that is planted or grafted outside the United States. subject to the 200 percent declining balance method and half-year convention. The amount of additional first-year depreciation allowed is $5,000. The remaining $5,000 of the cost of the property is depreciable under the rules applicable to five-year property. Thus, $1,000 also is allowed as a depreciation deduc-tion in 2017.
445The total depreciation deduc-tion with respect to the property for 2017 is $6,000. The remaining $4,000 adjusted basis of the property generally is recovered through otherwise applicable depreciation rules. Qualified property Property qualifying for the additional first-year depreciation deduction must meet all of the following requirements.
446First, the property must be: (1) property to which MACRS applies with an applicable recovery period of 20 years or less; (2) water utility property;
447(3) computer software other than computer software covered by section 197; or (4) qualified improvement property.
448 Second, the original use
449of the property must commence with the taxpayer.
450Third, the taxpayer must acquire the property within the applicable time period (as de-scribed below). Finally, the property must be placed in service before January 1, 2020. As noted above, an extension of the placed-in- service date of one year (i.e., before January 1, 2021) is provided for certain property with a recovery period of 10 years or longer, cer-tain transportation property, and certain aircraft.
451 To qualify, property must be acquired (1) before January 1, 2020, or (2) pursuant to a binding written contract which was entered into before January 1, 2020. With respect to property that is manufactured, constructed, or produced by the taxpayer for use by the taxpayer, the taxpayer must begin the man-ufacture, construction, or production of the property before January 1, 2020.452Property that is manufactured, constructed, or pro-duced for the taxpayer by another person under a contract that is entered into prior to the manufacture, construction, or produc-tion of the property is considered to be man-ufactured, constructed, or produced by the taxpayer.
453For property eligible for the ex-tended placed-in-service date, a special rule limits the amount of costs eligible for the additional first-year depreciation. With re-spect to such property, only the portion of the basis that is properly attributable to the costs incurred before January 1, 2020 (‘‘progress expenditures’’) is eligible for the additional first-year depreciation deduc-tion.
454 Qualified improvement property Qualified improvement property is any im-provement to an interior portion of a build-ing that is nonresidential real property if such improvement is placed in service after the date such building was first placed in service.
455Qualified improvement property does not include any improvement for which the expenditure is attributable to the en-largement of the building, any elevator or escalator, or the internal structural frame-work of the building. Election to accelerate AMT credits in lieu of bonus depreciation A corporation otherwise eligible for addi-tional first-year depreciation may elect to claim additional AMT credits in lieu of claiming additional depreciation with re-spect to qualified property.
456In the case of a corporation making this election, the straight line method is used for the regular tax and the AMT with respect to qualified property.
457 A corporation making an election in-creases the tax liability limitation under section 53(c) on the use of minimum tax credits by the bonus depreciation amount. The aggregate increase in credits allowable by reason of the increased limitation is treated as refundable. The bonus depreciation amount generally is equal to 20 percent of bonus depreciation for qualified property that could be claimed as a deduction absent an election under this provision.
458As originally enacted, the bonus depreciation amount for all taxable years was limited to the lesser of (1) $30 million or (2) six percent of the minimum tax credits allocable to the adjusted net minimum tax imposed for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2006. However, extensions of this provision have provided that this limitation applies separately to property subject to each extension. For taxable years ending after December 31, 2015, the bonus depreciation amount for a taxable year (as defined under present law with respect to all qualified property) is lim-ited to the lesser of (1) 50 percent of the min-imum tax credit for the first taxable year ending after December 31, 2015 (determined before the application of any tax liability limitation) or (2) the minimum tax credit for the taxable year allocable to the adjusted net minimum tax imposed for taxable years ending before January 1, 2016 (determined be-fore the application of any tax liability limi-tation and determined on a first-in, first-out basis). All corporations treated as a single em-ployer under section 52(a) are treated as one taxpayer for purposes of the limitation, as well as for electing the application of this provision.459 In the case of a corporation making an election which is a partner in a partnership, for purposes of determining the electing partner’s distributive share of partnership items, bonus depreciation does not apply to any qualified property and the straight line method is used with respect to that prop-erty.
460 In the case of a partnership having a single corporate partner owning (directly or indi-rectly) more than 50 percent of the capital and profits interests in the partnership, each partner takes into account its distributive share of partnership depreciation in deter-mining its bonus depreciation amount.
461 Special rules Passenger automobiles The limitation under section 280F on the amount of depreciation deductions allowed with respect to certain passenger auto-mobiles is increased in the first year by $8,000 for automobiles that qualify (and for which the taxpayer does not elect out of the additional first-year deduction).
462The $8,000 amount is phased down from $8,000 by $1,600 per calendar year beginning in 2018. Thus, the section 280F increase amount for prop-erty placed in service during 2018 is $6,400, and during 2019 is $4,800. While the under-lying section 280F limitation is indexed for inflation,
463 the section 280F increase amount is not indexed for inflation. The in-crease does not apply to a taxpayer who elects to accelerate AMT credits in lieu of bonus depreciation for a taxable year. Certain plants bearing fruits and nuts A special election is provided for certain plants bearing fruits and nuts.
464Under the election, the applicable percentage of the ad-justed basis of a specified plant which is planted or grafted after December 31, 2015, and before January 1, 2020, is deductible for regular tax and AMT purposes in the year planted or grafted by the taxpayer, and the adjusted basis is reduced by the amount of the deduction.
465The percentage is 50 per-cent for 2017, 40 percent for 2018, and 30 per-cent for 2019. A specified plant is any tree or vine that bears fruits or nuts, and any other plant that will have more than one yield of fruits or nuts and generally has a preproductive period of more than two years from planting or grafting to the time it be-gins bearing fruits or nuts.
466The election is revocable only with the consent of the Sec-retary, and if the election is made with re-spect to any specified plant, such plant is not treated as qualified property eligible for bonus depreciation in the subsequent taxable year in which it is placed in service.

470Sec. 197(c)(2) and (e)(4)(A). If section 197 applies to the acquisition of intangible assets held in con-nection with a trade or business, any value properly attributable to a ‘‘section 197 intangible’’ is amor-tizable on a straight-line basis over 15 years. Sec. 197(a) and (c). 
471Sec. 167(g)(6). Under the income forecast meth-od, a property’s depreciation deduction for a taxable year is determined by multiplying the adjusted basis of the property by a fraction, the numerator of which is the gross income generated by the property during the year, and the denominator of which is the total forecasted or estimated gross income expected to be generated prior to the close of the tenth tax-able year after the year the property is placed in service. Any costs that are not recovered by the end of the tenth taxable year after the property is placed in service may be taken into account as de-preciation in that year. Sec. 167(g)(1). 
472See Treas. Reg. sec. 1.181–2 for rules on making an election under this section. 
473For this purpose, a qualified film or television production is treated as commencing on the first date of principal photography.

487As defined in section 3301 of the House bill (In-terest), by cross reference to section 469(c)(7)(C). Note that a mortgage broker who is a broker of fi-nancial instruments is not in a real property trade or business for this purpose. See, e.g., CCA 201504010 (December 17, 2014). 
488As defined in section 3301 of the House bill (In-terest). 
489As defined in section 3301 of the House bill (In-terest). is determined under the percentage-of-com-pletion method.
467Solely for purposes of de-termining the percentage of completion under section 460(b)(1)(A), the cost of quali-fied property with a MACRS recovery period of seven years or less is taken into account as a cost allocated to the contract as if bonus depreciation had not been enacted for property placed in service before January 1, 2020 (January 1, 2021, in the case of longer production period property).
468 Intangible property MACRS does not apply to certain property, including any motion picture film, video tape, or sound recording, or to any other property if the taxpayer elects to exclude such property from MACRS and the taxpayer properly applies a unit-of-production method or other method of depreciation not ex-pressed in a term of years.
469Section 197 (amortization of goodwill and certain other intangibles) does not apply to certain intan-gible property, including certain property produced by the taxpayer or any interest in a film, sound recording, video tape, book or similar property not acquired in a trans-action (or a series of related transactions) involving the acquisition of assets consti-tuting a trade or business or substantial por-tion thereof.
470Thus, the recovery of the cost of a film, video tape, or similar property that is produced by the taxpayer or is acquired on a ‘‘stand-alone’’ basis by the taxpayer may not be determined under either the MACRS depreciation provisions or under the section 197 amortization provisions. The cost recov-ery of such property may be determined under section 167, which allows a deprecia-tion deduction for the reasonable allowance for the exhaustion, wear and tear, or obsoles-cence of the property if it is used in a trade or business or held for the production of in-come. In addition, the costs of motion pic-ture films, video tapes, sound recordings, copyrights, books, and patents are eligible to be recovered using the income forecast method of depreciation.
471 Expensing of certain qualified film, television and live theatrical productions Under section 181, a taxpayer may elect
472 to deduct the cost of any qualifying film, tel-evision and live theatrical production, com-mencing prior to January 1, 2017, in the year the expenditure is incurred in lieu of capital-izing the cost and recovering it through de-preciation allowances.
473A taxpayer may elect to deduct up to $15 million of the aggre-gate cost of the film or television production under this section.474The threshold is in-creased to $20 million if a significant amount of the production expenditures are incurred in areas eligible for designation as a low-in-come community or eligible for designation by the Delta Regional Authority as a dis-tressed county or isolated area of distress.
475 A qualified film, television or live theat-rical production means any production of a motion picture (whether released theatrically or directly to video cassette or any other format), television program or live staged play if at least 75 percent of the total compensation expended on the production is for services performed in the United States by actors, directors, producers, and other relevant production personnel.
476The term ‘‘compensation’’ does not include participa-tions and residuals (as defined in section 167(g)(7)(B)).
477 Each episode of a television series is treat-ed as a separate production, and only the first 44 episodes of a particular series qualify under the provision.
478Qualified productions do not include sexually explicit productions as referenced by section 2257 of title 18 of the U.S. Code.
479 A qualified live theatrical production is de-fined as a live staged production of a play (with or without music) which is derived from a written book or script and is pro-duced or presented by a commercial entity in any venue which has an audience capacity of not more than 3,000, or a series of venues the majority of which have an audience capacity of not more than 3,000.
480In addition, quali-fied live theatrical productions include any live staged production which is produced or presented by a taxable entity no more than 10 weeks annually in any venue which has an audience capacity of not more than 6,500.
481 In general, in the case of multiple live- staged productions, each such live-staged production is treated as a separate produc-tion. Similar to the exclusion for sexually explicit productions from the definition of qualified film or television productions, qualified live theatrical productions do not include stage performances that would be ex-cluded by section 2257(h)(1) of title 18 of the U.S. Code, if such provision were extended to live stage performances.
482 For purposes of recapture under section 1245, any deduction allowed under section 181 is treated as if it were a deduction allowable for amortization.
483 
HOUSE BILL  Full expensing for certain business assets The provision extends and modifies the ad-ditional first-year depreciation deduction through 2022 (through 2023 for longer produc-tion period property and certain aircraft). The 50-percent allowance is increased to 100 percent for property acquired and placed in service after September 27, 2017, and before January 1, 2023 (January 1, 2024, for longer production period property and certain air-craft), as well as for specified plants planted or grafted after September 27, 2017, and be-fore January 1, 2023. Special rules The $8,000 increase amount in the limita-tion on the depreciation deductions allowed with respect to certain passenger auto-mobiles is increased to $16,000 for passenger automobiles acquired and placed in service after September 27, 2017, and before January 1, 2023. The provision extends the special rule under the percentage-of-completion method for the allocation of bonus depreciation to a long-term contract for property placed in service before January 1, 2023 (January 1, 2024, in the case of longer production period property). Application to used property The provision removes the requirement that the original use of qualified property must commence with the taxpayer. Thus, the provision applies to purchases of used as well as new items. To prevent abuses, the ad-ditional first-year depreciation deduction ap-plies only to property purchased in an arm’s- length transaction. It does not apply to prop-erty received as a gift or from a decedent.484 In the case of trade-ins, like-kind exchanges, or involuntary conversions, it applies only to any money paid in addition to the traded-in property or in excess of the adjusted basis of the replaced property.
485It does not apply to property acquired in a nontaxable exchange such as a reorganization, to property ac-quired from a member of the taxpayer’s fam-ily, including a spouse, ancestors, and lineal descendants, or from another related entity as defined in section 267, nor to property ac-quired from a person who controls, is con-trolled by, or is under common control with, the taxpayer.
486Thus it does not apply, for example, if one member of an affiliated group of corporations purchases property from another member, or if an individual who controls a corporation purchases prop-erty from that corporation. Exception for certain businesses not subject to limitation on interest expense The provision excludes from the definition of qualified property any property used in a real property trade or business, i.e., any real property development, redevelopment, con-struction, reconstruction, acquisition, con-version, rental, operation, management, leasing, or brokerage trade or business.
487 The provision also excludes from the defi-nition of qualified property any property used in the trade or business of certain regu-lated public utilities, i.e., the trade or busi-ness of the furnishing or sale of (1) electrical energy, water, or sewage disposal services, (2) gas or steam through a local distribution system, or (3) transportation of gas or steam by pipeline, if the rates for such furnishing or sale, as the case may be, have been estab-lished or approved by a State or political subdivision thereof, by any agency or instru-mentality of the United States, or by a pub-lic service or public utility commission or other similar body of any State or political subdivision thereof.
488 In addition, the provision excludes from the definition of qualified property any prop-erty used in a trade or business that has had floor plan financing indebtedness,
489unless the taxpayer with such trade or business is not a tax shelter prohibited from using the cash method and is exempt from the interest

Election to accelerate AMT credits in lieu of bonus depreciation As a conforming amendment to the repeal of AMT,
490the provision repeals the election to accelerate AMT credits in lieu of bonus depreciation. Transition rule The present-law phase-down of bonus de-preciation is maintained for property ac-quired before September 28, 2017, and placed in service after September 27, 2017. Under the provision, in the case of property acquired and adjusted basis incurred before Sep-tember 28, 2017, the bonus depreciation rates are as follows. 
Phase-Down for Portion of Basis of Qualified Property Acquired before September 28, 2017 
Placed in Service Year Bonus Depreciation Percentage Qualified Property in General Longer Production Pe-riod Property and Cer-tain Aircraft 
2017 ............................. 50 percent ................... 50 percent 2018 ............................. 40 percent ................... 50 percent 2019 ............................. 30 percent ................... 40 percent 2020 ............................. None ............................. 30 percent 
Similarly, the section 280F increase amount in the limitation on the depreciation deductions allowed with respect to certain passenger automobiles acquired before Sep-tember 28, 2017, and placed in service after September 27, 2017, is $8,000 for 2017, $6,400 for 2018, and $4,800 for 2019. Effective date.—The provision generally ap-plies to property acquired
491and placed in service after September 27, 2017, and to speci-fied plants planted or grafted after such date. A transition rule provides that, for a tax-payer’s first taxable year ending after Sep-tember 27, 2017, the taxpayer may elect to apply section 168 without regard to the amendments made by this provision. In the case of any taxable year that in-cludes any portion of the period beginning on September 28, 2017, and ending on December 31, 2017, the amount of any net operating loss for such taxable year which may be treated as a net operating loss carryback is deter-mined without regard to the amendments made by this provision.
492 
SENATE AMENDMENT  In general The provision extends and modifies the ad-ditional first-year depreciation deduction through 2026 (through 2027 for longer produc-tion period property and certain aircraft). The 50-percent allowance is increased to 100 percent for property placed in service after September 27, 2017, and before January 1, 2023 (January 1, 2024, for longer production period property and certain aircraft), as well as for specified plants planted or grafted after Sep-tember 27, 2017, and before January 1, 2023. Thus, the provision repeals the phase-down of the 50-percent allowance for property placed in service after December 31, 2017, and for specified plants planted or grafted after such date. The 100-percent allowance is phased down by 20 percent per calendar year for property placed in service, and specified plants planted or grafted, in taxable years beginning after 2022 (after 2023 for longer production period property and certain air-craft). Under the provision, the bonus depre-ciation percentage rates are as follows. Placed in Service Year493 Bonus Depreciation Percentage Qualified Property in General Longer Production Pe-riod Property and Cer-tain Aircraft 
2023 ............................. 80 percent ................... 100 percent 2024 ............................. 60 percent ................... 80 percent 2025 ............................. 40 percent ................... 60 percent 2026 ............................. 20 percent ................... 40 percent 2027 ............................. None ............................. 20 percent
494 
Special rules The provision maintains the section 280F increase amount of $8,000 for passenger auto-mobiles placed in service after December 31, 2017. The provision extends the special rule under the percentage-of-completion method for the allocation of bonus depreciation to a long-term contract for property placed in service before January 1, 2027 (January 1, 2028, in the case of longer production period property). Application to qualified film, television and live theatrical productions The provision expands the definition of qualified property eligible for the additional first-year depreciation allowance to include qualified film, television and live theatrical productions
495placed in service after Sep-tember 27, 2017, and before January 1, 2027, for which a deduction otherwise would have been allowable under section 181 without re-gard to the dollar limitation or termination of such section. For purposes of this provi-sion, a production is considered placed in service at the time of initial release, broad-cast, or live staged performance ( i.e., at the time of the first commercial exhibition, broadcast, or live staged performance of a production to an audience). Exception for certain businesses not subject to limitation on interest expense The provision excludes from the definition of qualified property any property which is primarily used in the trade or business of the furnishing
496or sale of (1) electrical energy, water, or sewage disposal services, (2) gas or steam through a local distribution system, or (3) transportation of gas or steam by pipe-line, if the rates for such furnishing or sale, as the case may be, have been established or approved by a State or political subdivision thereof, by any agency or instrumentality of the United States, by a public service or pub-lic utility commission or other similar body of any State or political subdivision thereof, or by the governing or ratemaking body of an electric cooperative.
497 In addition, the provision excludes from the definition of qualified property any prop-erty used in a trade or business that has had floor plan financing indebtedness,
498unless the taxpayer with such trade or business is not a tax shelter prohibited from using the cash method and is exempt from the interest limitation rules in section 13301 of the Sen-ate amendment by meeting the small busi-ness gross receipts test of section 448(c). Effective date.—The provision generally ap-plies to property placed in service after Sep-tember 27, 2017, in taxable years ending after such date, and to specified plants planted or grafted after such date. A transition rule provides that, for a tax-payer’s first taxable year ending after Sep-tember 27, 2017, the taxpayer may elect to apply a 50-percent allowance instead of the 100-percent allowance.499 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the Sen-ate amendment but also includes the House bill’s removal of the requirement that the original use of qualified property must com-mence with the taxpayer (i.e., it allows the additional first-year depreciation deduction for new and used property). In addition, the conference agreement also follows the House bill’s application of the present-law phase-down of bonus deprecia-tion to property acquired before September 28, 2017, and placed in service after Sep-tember 27, 2017, as well as the present-law phase-down of the section 280F increase amount in the limitation on the depreciation deductions allowed with respect to certain passenger automobiles acquired before Sep-tember 28, 2017, and placed in service after September 27, 2017.

519Exercising authority granted by Congress, the Secretary issued Rev. Proc. 87–56, 1987–2 C.B. 674, laying out the framework of recovery periods for enumerated classes of assets. The Secretary clari-fied and modified the list of asset classes in Rev. Proc. 88–22, 1988–1 C.B. 785. In November 1988, Con-gress revoked the Secretary’s authority to modify the class lives of depreciable property. Rev. Proc. 87– 56, as modified, remains in effect except to the ex-tent that the Congress has, since 1988, statutorily modified the recovery period for certain depreciable assets, effectively superseding any administrative guidance with regard to such property. 
520Under the declining balance method the depre-ciation rate is determined by dividing the appro-priate percentage (here 150 or 200) by the appropriate recovery period. This leads to accelerated deprecia-tion when the declining balance percentage is great-er than 100. The table below illustrates depreciation for an asset with a cost of $1,000 and a seven-year re-covery period under the 200-percent declining bal-ance method, the 150-percent declining balance method, and the straight line method.

524Sec. 168(e)(3)(D)(i) and (ii). 2. Modifications to depreciation limitations on luxury automobiles and personal use property (sec. 13202 of the Senate amend-ment and sec. 280F of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  Section 280F(a) limits the annual cost re-covery deduction with respect to certain pas-senger automobiles. This limitation is com-monly referred to as the ‘‘luxury automobile depreciation limitation.’’ For passenger automobiles placed in service in 2017, and for which the additional first-year depreciation deduction under section 168(k) is not claimed, the maximum amount of allowable depreciation is $3,160 for the year in which the vehicle is placed in service, $5,100 for the second year, $3,050 for the third year, and $1,875 for the fourth and later years in the re-covery period.
503This limitation is indexed for inflation and applies to the aggregate de-duction provided under present law for de-preciation and section 179 expensing. Hence, passenger automobiles subject to section 280F are eligible for section 179 expensing only to the extent of the applicable limits contained in section 280F. For passenger automobiles eligible for the additional first- year depreciation allowance in 2017, the first- year limitation is increased by an additional $8,000.
504 For purposes of the depreciation limita-tion, passenger automobiles are defined broadly to include any four-wheeled vehicles that are manufactured primarily for use on public streets, roads, and highways and which are rated at 6,000 pounds unloaded gross vehicle weight or less.
505In the case of a truck or a van, the depreciation limitation applies to vehicles that are rated at 6,000 pounds gross vehicle weight or less. Sport utility vehicles are treated as a truck for the purpose of applying the section 280F limita-tion. Basis not recovered in the recovery period of a passenger automobile is allowable as an expense in subsequent taxable years.
506The expensed amount is limited in each such sub-sequent taxable year to the amount of the limitation in the fourth year in the recovery period. Listed property In the case of certain listed property, spe-cial rules apply. Listed property generally is defined as (1) any passenger automobile; (2) any other property used as a means of trans-portation;
507(3) any property of a type gen-erally used for purposes of entertainment, recreation, or amusement; (4) any computer or peripheral equipment;
508and (5) any other property of a type specified in Treasury reg-ulations.
509 First, if for the taxable year in which the property is placed in service, the use of the property for trade or business purposes does not exceed 50 percent of the total use of the property, then the depreciation deduction with respect to such property is determined under the alternative depreciation system.510 The alternative depreciation system gen-erally requires the use of the straight-line method and a recovery period equal to the class life of the property.
511Second, if an in-dividual owns or leases listed property that is used by the individual in connection with the performance of services as an employee, no depreciation deduction, expensing allow-ance, or deduction for lease payments is available with respect to such use unless the use of the property is for the convenience of the employer and required as a condition of employment.
512Both limitations apply for purposes of section 179 expensing. For listed property, no deduction is al-lowed unless the taxpayer adequately sub-stantiates the expense and business usage of the property.
513A taxpayer must substan-tiate the elements of each expenditure or use of listed property, including (1) the amount (e.g., cost) of each separate expenditure and the amount of business or investment use, based on the appropriate measure ( e.g., mile- age for automobiles), and the total use of the property for the taxable period, (2) the date of the expenditure or use, and (3) the busi-ness purposes for the expenditure or use.
514 The level of substantiation for business or investment use of listed property varies de-pending on the facts and circumstances. In general, the substantiation must contain sufficient information as to each element of every business or investment use.
515 
HOUSE BILL  No provision. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The provision increases the depreciation limitations under section 280F that apply to listed property. For passenger automobiles placed in service after December 31, 2017, and for which the additional first-year deprecia-tion deduction under section 168(k) is not claimed, the maximum amount of allowable depreciation is $10,000 for the year in which the vehicle is placed in service, $16,000 for the second year, $9,600 for the third year, and $5,760 for the fourth and later years in the re-covery period.
516The limitations are indexed for inflation for passenger automobiles placed in service after 2018. The provision removes computer or periph-eral equipment from the definition of listed property. Such property is therefore not sub-ject to the heightened substantiation re-quirements that apply to listed property. Effective date.—The provision is effective for property placed in service after December 31, 2017, in taxable years ending after such date. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the Sen-ate amendment. 3. Modifications of treatment of certain farm property (sec. 13203 of the Senate amend-ment and sec. 168 of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  A taxpayer generally must capitalize the cost of property used in a trade or business or held for the production of income and re-cover such cost over time through annual de-ductions for depreciation or amortization.517 Tangible property generally is depreciated under the modified accelerated cost recovery system (‘‘MACRS’’), which determines depre-ciation for different types of property based on an assigned applicable depreciation meth-od, recovery period, and convention.
518 The applicable recovery period for an asset is determined in part by statute and in part by historic Treasury guidance.
519The ‘‘type of property’’ of an asset is used to determine the ‘‘class life’’ of the asset, which in turn dictates the applicable recovery period for the asset. The MACRS recovery periods applicable to most tangible personal property range from three to 20 years. The depreciation methods generally applicable to tangible personal property are the 200-percent and 150-percent declining balance methods,
520switching to the straight line method for the first taxable year where using the straight line method with respect to the adjusted basis as of the beginning of that year yields a larger depre-ciation allowance. The recovery periods for most real property are 39 years for nonresi-dential real property and 27.5 years for resi-dential rental property. The straight line de-preciation method is required for the afore-mentioned real property. Property used in a farming business is as-signed various recovery periods in the same manner as other business property. For ex-ample, depreciable assets used in agriculture activities that are assigned a recovery period of 7 years include machinery and equipment, grain bins, and fences (but no other land im-provements), that are used in the production of crops or plants, vines, and trees; livestock; the operation of farm dairies, nurseries, greenhouses, sod farms, mushrooms cellars, cranberry bogs, apiaries, and fur farms; and the performance of agriculture, animal hus-bandry, and horticultural services.
521Cotton ginning assets are also assigned a recovery period of 7 years.
522Any single purpose agri-cultural or horticultural structure,
523and any tree or vine bearing fruit or nuts are as-signed a recovery period of 10 years.

538Sec. 168. 
539Exercising authority granted by Congress, the Secretary issued Rev. Proc. 87–56, 1987–2 C.B. 674, laying out the framework of recovery periods for enumerated classes of assets. The Secretary clari-fied and modified the list of asset classes in Rev. Proc. 88–22, 1988–1 C.B. 785. In November 1988, Con-gress revoked the Secretary’s authority to modify the class lives of depreciable property. Rev. Proc. 87– 56, as modified, remains in effect except to the ex-tent that the Congress has, since 1988, statutorily modified the recovery period for certain depreciable assets, effectively superseding any administrative guidance with regard to such property. 
540Under the declining balance method the depre-ciation rate is determined by dividing the appro-priate percentage (here 150 or 200) by the appropriate recovery period. This leads to accelerated deprecia-tion when the declining balance percentage is great-er than 100. The table below illustrates depreciation for an asset with a cost of $1,000 and a seven-year re-covery period under the 200-percent declining bal-ance method, the 150-percent declining balance method, and the straight line method.

526the original use of which commenced with the taxpayer after December 31, 2008, and which was placed in service before January 1, 2010.
527 Any property (other than nonresidential real property,
528residential rental prop-erty,
529and trees or vines bearing fruits or nuts
530) used in a farming business531is sub- ject to the 150-percent declining balance method.
532 Under a special accounting rule, certain taxpayers engaged in the business of farming who elect to deduct preproductive period ex-penditures are required to depreciate all farming assets using the alternative depre-ciation system (i.e., using longer recovery periods and the straight line method).
533 
HOUSE BILL  No provision. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The provision shortens the recovery period from 7 to 5 years for any machinery or equip-ment (other than any grain bin, cotton gin-ning asset, fence, or other land improve-ment) used in a farming business, the origi-nal use of which commences with the tax-payer and is placed in service after December 31, 2017. The provision also repeals the required use of the 150-percent declining balance method for property used in a farming business ( i.e., for 3-, 5-, 7-, and 10-year property). The 150- percent declining balance method will con-tinue to apply to any 15-year or 20-year prop-erty used in the farming business to which the straight line method does not apply, or to property for which the taxpayer elects the use of the 150-percent declining balance method. For these purposes, the term ‘‘farming business’’ means a farming business as de-fined in section 263A(e)(4). Thus, the term ‘‘farming business’’ means a trade or busi-ness involving the cultivation of land or the raising or harvesting of any agricultural or horticultural commodity (e.g., the trade or business of operating a nursery or sod farm; the raising or harvesting of trees bearing fruit, nuts, or other crops; the raising of or-namental trees (other than evergreen trees that are more than six years old at the time they are severed from their roots); and the raising, shearing, feeding, caring for, train-ing, and management of animals).
534A farm- ing business includes processing activities that are normally incident to the growing, raising, or harvesting of agricultural or hor-ticultural products.
535A farming business does not include contract harvesting of an agricultural or horticultural commodity grown or raised by another taxpayer, or merely buying and reselling plants or ani-mals grown or raised by another taxpayer.
536 Effective date.—The provision is effective for property placed in service after December 31, 2017, in taxable years ending after such date. CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the Sen-ate amendment. 4. Applicable recovery period for real prop-erty (sec. 13204 of the Senate amendment and sec. 168 of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  In general A taxpayer generally must capitalize the cost of property used in a trade or business or held for the production of income and re-cover such cost over time through annual de-ductions for depreciation or amortization.
537 Tangible property generally is depreciated under the modified accelerated cost recovery system (‘‘MACRS’’), which determines depre-ciation for different types of property based on an assigned applicable depreciation meth-od, recovery period, and convention.
538 Recovery periods and depreciation methods The applicable recovery period for an asset is determined in part by statute and in part by historic Treasury guidance.
539The ‘‘type of property’’ of an asset is used to determine the ‘‘class life’’ of the asset, which in turn dictates the applicable recovery period for the asset. The MACRS recovery periods applicable to most tangible personal property range from three to 20 years. The depreciation methods generally applicable to tangible personal property are the 200-percent and 150-percent declining balance methods,
540switching to the straight line method for the first taxable year where using the straight line method with respect to the adjusted basis as of the beginning of that year yields a larger depre-ciation allowance. The recovery periods for most real property are 39 years for nonresi-dential real property and 27.5 years for resi-dential rental property. The straight line de-preciation method is required for the afore-mentioned real property. Placed-in-service conventions Depreciation of an asset begins when the asset is deemed to be placed in service under the applicable convention.
541Under MACRS, nonresidential real property, residential rental property, and any railroad grading or tunnel bore generally are subject to the mid- month convention, which treats all property placed in service during any month (or dis-posed of during any month) as placed in serv-ice (or disposed of) on the mid-point of such month.
542All other property generally is subject to the half-year convention, which treats all property placed in service during any taxable year (or disposed of during any taxable year) as placed in service (or dis-posed of) on the mid-point of such taxable year to reflect the assumption that assets are placed in service ratably throughout the year.543However, if substantial property is placed in service during the last three months of a taxable year, a special rule re-quires use of the mid-quarter convention,
544 designed to prevent the recognition of dis-proportionately large amounts of first-year depreciation under the half-year convention. Depreciation of additions or improvements to property The recovery period for any addition or im-provement to real or personal property be-gins on the later of (1) the date on which the addition or improvement is placed in service, or (2) the date on which the property with re-spect to which such addition or improvement is made is placed in service.
545Any MACRS deduction for an addition or improvement to any property is to be computed in the same manner as the deduction for the underlying property would be if such property were placed in service at the same time as such addition or improvement. Thus, for example, the cost of an improvement to a building that constitutes nonresidential real property is recovered over 39 years using the straight line method and mid-month convention. Cer-tain improvements to nonresidential real property are eligible for the additional first- year depreciation deduction if the other re-quirements of section 168(k) are met ( i.e., im- provements that constitute ‘‘qualified im-provement property’’).
546 Qualified improvement property Qualified improvement property is any im-provement to an interior portion of a build-ing that is nonresidential real property if such improvement is placed in service after the date such building was first placed in service.
547Qualified improvement property does not include any improvement for which the expenditure is attributable to the en-largement of the building, any elevator or escalator, or the internal structural frame-work of the building. Depreciation of leasehold improvements Generally, depreciation allowances for im-provements made on leased property are de-termined under MACRS, even if the MACRS recovery period assigned to the property is longer than the term of the lease.
548This rule applies regardless of whether the lessor or the lessee places the leasehold improve-ments in service. If a leasehold improvement constitutes an addition or improvement to nonresidential real property already placed in service, the improvement generally is de-preciated using the straight-line method over a 39-year recovery period, beginning in the month the addition or improvement was placed in service. However, exceptions to the 39-year recovery period exist for certain qualified leasehold improvements, qualified restaurant property, and qualified retail im-provement property.

568For additional changes to section 179, see sec-tion 13101 of the Senate amendment (Modifications of rules for expensing depreciable business assets). 
569As defined in section 13301 of the Senate amend-ment (Limitation on deduction for interest), by cross reference to section 469(c)(7)(C) (i.e., any real property development, redevelopment, construction, reconstruction, acquisition, conversion, rental, op-eration, management, leasing, or brokerage trade or business). Note that a mortgage broker who is a broker of financial instruments is not in a real prop-erty trade or business for this purpose. See, e.g., CCA 201504010 (December 17, 2014). 
570See secs. 263(a) and 167. However, where prop-erty is not used exclusively in a taxpayer’s business, the amount eligible for a deduction must be reduced by the amount related to personal use. See, e.g., sec-tion 280A. 
571Sec. 168. Qualified leasehold improvement property Section 168(e)(3)(E)(iv) provides a statutory 15-year recovery period for qualified lease-hold improvement property. Qualified lease-hold improvement property is any improve-ment to an interior portion of a building that is nonresidential real property, provided certain requirements are met.
549The im- provement must be made under or pursuant to a lease either by the lessee (or sublessee), or by the lessor, of that portion of the build-ing to be occupied exclusively by the lessee (or sublessee). The improvement must be placed in service more than three years after the date the building was first placed in serv-ice. Qualified leasehold improvement prop-erty does not include any improvement for which the expenditure is attributable to the enlargement of the building, any elevator or escalator, any structural component bene-fiting a common area, or the internal struc-tural framework of the building. If a lessor makes an improvement that qualifies as qualified leasehold improvement property, such improvement does not qualify as quali-fied leasehold improvement property to any subsequent owner of such improvement. An exception to the rule applies in the case of death and certain transfers of property that qualify for non-recognition treatment. Qualified leasehold improvement property is generally recovered using the straight-line method and a half-year convention,
550and is eligible for the additional first-year depre-ciation deduction if the other requirements of section 168(k) are met.
551 Qualified restaurant property Section 168(e)(3)(E)(v) provides a statutory 15-year recovery period for qualified res-taurant property. Qualified restaurant prop-erty is any section 1250 property that is a building or an improvement to a building, if more than 50 percent of the building’s square footage is devoted to the preparation of, and seating for on-premises consumption of, pre-pared meals.
552Qualified restaurant property is recovered using the straight-line method and a half-year convention.
553Additionally, qualified restaurant property is not eligible for the additional first-year depreciation de-duction unless it also satisfies the definition of qualified improvement property.
554 Qualified retail improvement property Section 168(e)(3)(E)(ix) provides a statutory 15-year recovery period for qualified retail improvement property. Qualified retail im-provement property is any improvement to an interior portion of a building which is nonresidential real property if such portion is open to the general public
555and is used in the retail trade or business of selling tan-gible personal property to the general public, and such improvement is placed in service more than three years after the date the building was first placed in service.
556Quali- fied retail improvement property does not include any improvement for which the ex-penditure is attributable to the enlargement of the building, any elevator or escalator, any structural component benefiting a com-mon area, or the internal structural frame-work of the building.
557In the case of an im-provement made by the owner of such im-provement, the improvement is a qualified retail improvement only so long as the im-provement is held by such owner.558 Retail establishments that qualify for the 15-year recovery period include those pri-marily engaged in the sale of goods. Exam-ples of these retail establishments include, but are not limited to, grocery stores, cloth-ing stores, hardware stores, and convenience stores. Establishments primarily engaged in providing services, such as professional serv-ices, financial services, personal services, health services, and entertainment, do not qualify. Generally, it is intended that busi-nesses defined as a store retailer under the current North American Industry Classifica-tion System (industry sub-sectors 441 through 453) qualify while those in other in-dustry classes do not qualify.
559 Qualified retail improvement property is recovered using the straight-line method and a half-year convention,
560and is eligible for the additional first-year depreciation deduc-tion if the other requirements of section 168(k) are met.
561 Alternative depreciation system The alternative depreciation system (‘‘ADS’’) is required to be used for tangible property used predominantly outside the United States, certain tax-exempt use prop-erty, tax-exempt bond financed property, and certain imported property covered by an Ex-ecutive order.
562An election to use ADS is available to taxpayers for any class of prop-erty for any taxable year.
563Under ADS, all property is depreciated using the straight line method over recovery periods which generally are equal to the class life of the property, with certain exceptions.
564For ex- ample nonresidential real and residential rental property have a 40-year ADS recovery period, while qualified leasehold improve-ment property, qualified restaurant prop-erty, and qualified retail improvement prop-erty have a 39-year ADS recovery period.
565 
HOUSE BILL  No provision. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The provision shortens the recovery period for determining the depreciation deduction with respect to nonresidential real and resi-dential rental property to 25 years. As a con-forming amendment, the provision changes the statutory recovery period for nonresiden-tial real and residential rental property to 25 years for purposes of determining whether a rental agreement is a long-term agreement under the section 467 rules applicable to cer-tain payments for the use of property or services.
566The provision also shortens the ADS recovery period for residential rental property from 40 years to 30 years. The provision eliminates the separate defi-nitions of qualified leasehold improvement, qualified restaurant, and qualified retail im-provement property, and provides a general 10-year recovery period for qualified im-provement property,567and a 20-year ADS re-covery period for such property. Thus, for ex-ample, qualified improvement property placed in service after December 31, 2017, is generally depreciable over 10 years using the straight line method and half-year conven-tion, without regard to whether the improve-ments are property subject to a lease, placed in service more than three years after the date the building was first placed in service, or made to a restaurant building. Restaurant building property placed in service after De-cember 31, 2017, that does not meet the defi-nition of qualified improvement property is depreciable over 25 years as nonresidential real property, using the straight line method and the mid-month convention. As a conforming amendment, the provision replaces the references in section 179(f) to qualified leasehold improvement property, qualified restaurant property, and qualified retail improvement property with a ref-erence to qualified improvement property.
568 Thus, for example, the provision allows sec-tion 179 expensing for improvement property without regard to whether the improvements are property subject to a lease, placed in service more than three years after the date the building was first placed in service, or made to a restaurant building. Restaurant building property placed in service after De-cember 31, 2017, that does not meet the defi-nition of qualified improvement property is not eligible for section 179 expensing. The provision also requires a real property trade or business
569electing out of the limi-tation on the deduction for interest to use ADS to depreciate any of its nonresidential real property, residential rental property, and qualified improvement property. Effective date.—The provision is effective for property placed in service after December 31, 2017. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the Sen-ate amendment except that it maintains the present law general MACRS recovery periods of 39 and 27.5 years for nonresidential real and residential rental property, respectively. In addition, the conference agreement pro-vides a general 15-year MACRS recovery pe-riod for qualified improvement property. 5. Use of alternative depreciation system for electing farming businesses (sec. 13205 of the Senate amendment and sec. 168 of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  In general A taxpayer generally must capitalize the cost of property used in a trade or business or held for the production of income and re-cover such cost over time through annual de-ductions for depreciation or amortization.
570 Tangible property generally is depreciated under the modified accelerated cost recovery system (‘‘MACRS’’), which determines depre-ciation for different types of property based on an assigned applicable depreciation meth-od, recovery period, and convention.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H10041 December 15, 2017 
572Exercising authority granted by Congress, the Secretary issued Rev. Proc. 87–56, 1987–2 C.B. 674, laying out the framework of recovery periods for enumerated classes of assets. The Secretary clari-fied and modified the list of asset classes in Rev. Proc. 88–22, 1988–1 C.B. 785. In November 1988, Con-gress revoked the Secretary’s authority to modify the class lives of depreciable property. Rev. Proc. 87– 56, as modified, remains in effect except to the ex-tent that the Congress has, since 1988, statutorily modified the recovery period for certain depreciable assets, effectively superseding any administrative guidance with regard to such property. 
573Under the declining balance method the depre-ciation rate is determined by dividing the appro-priate percentage (here 150 or 200) by the appropriate recovery period. This leads to accelerated deprecia-tion when the declining balance percentage is great-er than 100. The table below illustrates depreciation for an asset with a cost of $1,000 and a seven-year re-covery period under the 200-percent declining bal-ance method, the 150-percent declining balance method, and the straight line method. 
574However, section 13204 of the bill (Applicable re-covery period for real property) reduces the recovery period to 25 years for both nonresidential real prop-erty and residential rental property. (see endnote for table)

The 150-percent declining balance method will continue to apply to any 15-year or 20-year property used in the farming business to which the straight line method does not apply, or to property for which the taxpayer elects the use of the 150-percent declin-ing balance method.

594As defined in section 13301 of the Senate amend-ment (Limitation on deduction for interest), by cross reference to section 263A(e)(4) (i.e., farming business means the trade or business of farming and includes the trade or business of operating a nursery or sod farm, or the raising or harvesting of trees bearing fruit, nuts, or other crops, or ornamental trees (other than evergreen trees that are more than six years old at the time they are severed from their roots)). Treas. Reg. sec. 1.263A–4(a)(4) further defines a farming business as a trade or business involving the cultivation of land or the raising or harvesting of any agricultural or horticultural commodity. Ex-amples of a farming business include the trade or business of operating a nursery or sod farm; the rais-ing or harvesting of trees bearing fruit, nuts, or other crops; the raising of ornamental trees (other than evergreen trees that are more than six years old at the time they are severed from their roots); and the raising, shearing, feeding, caring for, train-ing, and management of animals. A farming busi-ness also includes processing activities that are nor-mally incident to the growing, raising, or harvesting of agricultural or horticultural products. See Treas. Reg. sec. 1.263A–4(a)(4)(i) and (ii). A farming business does not include contract harvesting of an agricul-tural or horticultural commodity grown or raised by another taxpayer, or merely buying and reselling plants or animals grown or raised by another tax-payer. See Treas. Reg. sec. 1.263A–4(a)(4)(i). 
595See section 13301 of the Senate amendment (Limitation on deduction for interest). Section 13301 of the Senate amendment also includes an exception from the limitation on the deduction for interest for taxpayers meeting the $15 million gross receipts test.

600Ibid. The applicable recovery period for an asset is determined in part by statute and in part by historic Treasury guidance.
572The ‘‘type of property’’ of an asset is used to determine the ‘‘class life’’ of the asset, which in turn dictates the applicable recovery period for the asset. The MACRS recovery periods applicable to most tangible personal property range from three to 20 years. The depreciation methods generally applicable to tangible personal property are the 200-percent and 150-percent declining balance methods,
573switching to the straight line method for the first taxable year where using the straight line method with respect to the adjusted basis as of the beginning of that year yields a larger depre-ciation allowance. The recovery periods for most real property are 39 years for nonresi-dential real property and 27.5 years for resi-dential rental property.
574The straight line depreciation method is required for the aforementioned real property. Property used in a farming business is as-signed various recovery periods in the same manner as other business property. For ex-ample, depreciable assets used in agriculture activities that are assigned a recovery period of 7 years include machinery and equipment, grain bins, and fences (but no other land im-provements), that are used in the production of crops or plants, vines, and trees; livestock; the operation of farm dairies, nurseries, greenhouses, sod farms, mushrooms cellars, cranberry bogs, apiaries, and fur farms; and the performance of agriculture, animal hus-bandry, and horticultural services.
575Cotton ginning assets are also assigned a recovery period of 7 years.
576Any single purpose agri-cultural or horticultural structure,
577and any tree or vine bearing fruit or nuts are as-signed a recovery period of 10 years.
578Land improvements such as drainage facilities, paved lots, and water wells are assigned a re-covery period of 15 years.
579 A 5-year recovery period was assigned to new farm machinery or equipment (other than any grain bin, cotton ginning asset, fence, or other land improvement) which was used in a farming business,580the original use of which commenced with the taxpayer after December 31, 2008, and which was placed in service before January 1, 2010.
581 Any property (other than nonresidential real property,
582residential rental prop-erty,
583and trees or vines bearing fruits or nuts
584) used in a farming business585is sub- ject to the 150-percent declining balance method.
586 Alternative depreciation system The alternative depreciation system (‘‘ADS’’) is required to be used for tangible property used predominantly outside the United States, certain tax-exempt use prop-erty, tax-exempt bond financed property, and certain imported property covered by an Ex-ecutive order.
587An election to use ADS is available to taxpayers for any class of prop-erty for any taxable year.
588Under ADS, all property is depreciated using the straight line method over recovery periods which generally are equal to the class life of the property, with certain exceptions.
589For ex- ample, any single purpose agricultural or horticultural structure has a 15-year ADS re-covery period,
590while any tree or vine bear-ing fruit or nuts has a 20-year ADS recovery period.
591Similarly, land improvements such as drainage facilities, paved lots, and water wells have an ADS recovery period of 20 years.
592 Under a special accounting rule, certain taxpayers engaged in the business of farming who elect to deduct preproductive period ex-penditures under the uniform capitalization rules are required to depreciate all farming assets using ADS.
593 
HOUSE BILL  No provision. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The provision requires an electing farming business,
594i.e., a farming business electing out of the limitation on the deduction for in-terest,595to use ADS to depreciate any prop-erty with a recovery period of 10 years or more (e.g., property such as single purpose agricultural or horticultural structures, trees or vines bearing fruit or nuts, farm buildings, and certain land improvements). Effective date.—The provision is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the Sen-ate amendment. 6. Expensing of certain costs of replanting citrus plants lost by reason of casualty (sec. 13207 of the Senate amendment and sec. 263A of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  In general The uniform capitalization (‘‘UNICAP’’) rules, which were enacted as part of the Tax Reform Act of 1986,
596require certain direct and indirect costs allocable to real or tan-gible personal property produced by the tax-payer to be either capitalized into the basis of such property or included in inventory, as applicable.
597For real or personal property acquired by the taxpayer for resale, section 263A generally requires certain direct and in-direct costs allocable to such property to be either capitalized into the basis of such prop-erty or included in inventory, as applicable. Section 263A generally requires the cap-italization of the direct and indirect costs al-locable to the production of any property in a farming business, including animals and plants without regard to the length of their preproductive period.
598The costs of a plant generally required to be capitalized under section 263(a) include preparatory costs in-curred so that the plant’s growing process may begin, such as the acquisition costs of the seed, seedling, or plant. Under section 263A, the costs of producing a plant gen-erally required to be capitalized also include the preproductive period costs of planting, cultivating, maintaining, and developing the plant during the preproductive period.
599 Preproductive period costs may include man-agement, irrigation, pruning, soil and water conservation, fertilizing, frost protection, spraying, harvesting, storage and handling, upkeep, electricity, tax depreciation and re-pairs on buildings and equipment used in raising the plants, farm overhead, taxes, and interest, as applicable.

Such replanting costs generally include costs attributable to the replanting, culti-vating, maintaining, and developing of the plants that were lost or damaged that are incurred during the preproductive period. Treas. Reg. sec. 1.263A– 4(e)(1). The acquisition costs of the replacement trees or seedlings must still be capitalized under section 263(a) (see, e.g., T.D. 8897, 65 FR 50638, Treas. Reg. sec. 1.263A–4(e)(3), Examples 1–3, and TAM 9547002 (July 18, 1995)), potentially subject to the special bonus depreciation deduction in the year of planting under section 168(k)(5). 
605Sec. 263A(d)(2)(B). Material participation for this purpose is determined in a similar manner as under section 2032A(e)(6) (relating to qualified use valuation of farm property upon death of the tax-payer). 606See secs. 263(a) and 167. However, where prop-erty is not used exclusively in a taxpayer’s business, the amount eligible for a deduction must be reduced by the amount related to personal use. See, e.g., sec- tion 280A. 
607The applicable recovery period for an asset is determined in part by statute and in part by historic Treasury guidance. Exercising authority granted by Congress, the Secretary issued Rev. Proc. 87–56, 1987– 2 C.B. 674, laying out the framework of recovery pe-riods for enumerated classes of assets. The Sec-retary clarified and modified the list of asset classes in Rev. Proc. 88–22, 1988–1 C.B. 785. In November 1988, Congress revoked the Secretary’s authority to mod-ify the class lives of depreciable property. Rev. Proc. 87–56, as modified, remains in effect except to the ex-tent that the Congress has, since 1988, statutorily modified the recovery period for certain depreciable assets, effectively superseding any administrative guidance with regard to such property.

614Sec. 179(b)(5). For this purpose, a sport utility vehicle is defined to exclude any vehicle that: (1) is designed for more than nine individuals in seating rearward of the driver’s seat; (2) is equipped with an open cargo area, or a covered box not readily acces-sible from the passenger compartment, of at least six feet in interior length; or (3) has an integral en-closure, fully enclosing the driver compartment and load carrying device, does not have seating rearward of the driver’s seat, and has no body section pro-truding more than 30 inches ahead of the leading edge of the windshield.

617Sec. 312(k)(3)(B). 
618Sec. 179(c)(1). Special rules for plant farmers Section 263A provides an exception to the general capitalization requirements for tax-payers who raise, harvest, or grow trees.
601 Under this exception, section 263A does not apply to trees raised, harvested, or grown by the taxpayer (other than trees bearing fruit, nuts, or other crops, or ornamental trees) and any real property underlying such trees. Similarly, the UNICAP rules do not apply to any plant having a preproductive period of two years or less, which is produced by a tax-payer in a farming business (unless the tax-payer is required to use an accrual method of accounting under section 447 or 448(a)(3)).
602 Hence, in general, the UNICAP rules apply to the production of plants that have a preproductive period of more than two years, and to taxpayers required to use an accrual method of accounting. Plant farmers otherwise required to cap-italize preproductive period costs may elect to deduct such costs currently, provided the alternative depreciation system described in section 168(g)(2) is used on all farm assets and the preproductive period costs are recap-tured upon disposition of the product.
603The election is not available to taxpayers re-quired to use the accrual method of account-ing. Moreover, the election is not available with respect to certain costs attributable to planting, cultivating, maintaining, or devel-oping citrus or almond groves. Section 263A does not apply to costs in-curred in replanting edible crops for human consumption following loss or damage due to freezing temperatures, disease, drought, pests, or casualty.
604The same type of crop as the lost or damaged crop must be re-planted. However, the exception to capital-ization still applies if the replanting occurs on a parcel of land other than the land on which the damage occurred provided the acreage of the new land does not exceed that of the land to which the damage occurred and the new land is located in the United States. This exception may also apply to costs incurred by persons other than the tax-payer who incurred the loss or damage, pro-vided (1) the taxpayer who incurred the loss or damage retains an equity interest of more than 50 percent in the property on which the loss or damage occurred at all times during the taxable year in which the replanting costs are paid or incurred, and (2) the person holding a minority equity interest and claiming the deduction materially partici-pates in the planting, maintenance, cultiva-tion, or development of the property during the taxable year in which the replanting costs are paid or incurred.
605 
HOUSE BILL  No provision. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The provision modifies the special rule for costs incurred by persons other than the tax-payer in connection with replanting an edi-ble crop for human consumption following loss or damage due to casualty. Under the provision, with respect to replanting costs paid or incurred after the date of enactment, but no later than a date which is ten years after such date of enactment, for citrus plants lost or damaged due to casualty, such replanting costs may also be deducted by a person other than the taxpayer if (1) the tax-payer has an equity interest of not less than 50 percent in the replanted citrus plants at all times during the taxable year in which the replanting costs are paid or incurred and such other person holds any part of the re-maining equity interest, or (2) such other person acquires all of the taxpayer’s equity interest in the land on which the lost or damaged citrus plants were located at the time of such loss or damage, and the replant-ing is on such land. Effective date.—The provision is effective for costs paid or incurred after the date of enactment. CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the Sen-ate amendment. C. Small Business Reforms 1. Expansion of section 179 expensing (sec. 3201 of the House bill, sec. 13101 of the Sen-ate amendment, and sec. 179 of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  A taxpayer generally must capitalize the cost of property used in a trade or business or held for the production of income and re-cover such cost over time through annual de-ductions for depreciation or amortization.
606 Tangible property generally is depreciated under the modified accelerated cost recovery system (‘‘MACRS’’), which determines depre-ciation for different types of property based on an assigned applicable depreciation meth-od, recovery period,
607and convention.608 Election to expense certain depreciable busi-ness assets A taxpayer may elect under section 179 to deduct (or ‘‘expense’’) the cost of qualifying property, rather than to recover such costs through depreciation deductions, subject to limitation. The maximum amount a tax-payer may expense is $500,000 of the cost of qualifying property placed in service for the taxable year.
609The $500,000 amount is re-duced (but not below zero) by the amount by which the cost of qualifying property placed in service during the taxable year exceeds $2,000,000.
610 The $500,000 and $2,000,000 amounts are indexed for inflation for taxable years beginning after 2015.
611 In general, qualifying property is defined as depreciable tangible personal property that is purchased for use in the active con-duct of a trade or business. Qualifying prop-erty also includes off-the-shelf computer software and qualified real property ( i.e., qualified leasehold improvement property, qualified restaurant property, and qualified retail improvement property).612Qualifying property excludes any property described in section 50(b) (i.e., certain property not eligi-ble for the investment tax credit).
613 Passenger automobiles subject to the sec-tion 280F limitation are eligible for section 179 expensing only to the extent of the dollar limitations in section 280F. For sport utility vehicles above the 6,000 pound weight rating and not more than the 14,000 pound weight rating, which are not subject to the limita-tion under section 280F, the maximum cost that may be expensed for any taxable year under section 179 is $25,000 (the ‘‘sport utility vehicle limitation’’).
614 The amount eligible to be expensed for a taxable year may not exceed the taxable in-come for such taxable year that is derived from the active conduct of a trade or busi-ness (determined without regard to this pro-vision).
615Any amount that is not allowed as a deduction because of the taxable income limitation may be carried forward to suc-ceeding taxable years (subject to limita-tions). No general business credit under section 38 is allowed with respect to any amount for which a deduction is allowed under section 179.
616If a corporation makes an election under section 179 to deduct expenditures, the full amount of the deduction does not reduce earnings and profits. Rather, the expendi-tures that are deducted reduce corporate earnings and profits ratably over a five-year period.
617 An expensing election is made under rules prescribed by the Secretary.
618In general, any election or specification made with re-spect to any property may not be revoked except with the consent of the Commis-sioner. However, an election or specification under section 179 may be revoked by the tax-payer without consent of the Commissioner. 
HOUSE BILL  The provision increases the maximum amount a taxpayer may expense under sec-tion 179 to $5,000,000, and increases the phase- out threshold amount to $20,000,000 for five taxable years, i.e., for taxable years begin-ning in 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022. Thus, the provision provides that the maximum amount a taxpayer may expense, for taxable years beginning after 2017 and before 2023, is $5,000,000 of the cost of qualifying property placed in service for the taxable year. The $5,000,000 amount is reduced (but not below zero) by the amount by which the cost of qualifying property placed in service during the taxable year exceeds $20,000,000. The $5,000,000 and $20,000,000 amounts are indexed for inflation for taxable years beginning after 2018. The provision also expands the definition of qualified real property under section 179

For purposes of the provision, qualified energy efficient heating and air- conditioning property means any depreciable section 1250 property that is (i) installed as part of a building’s heating, cooling, ventila-tion, or hot water system, and (ii) within the scope of Standard 90.1–2007 of the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air- Conditioning Engineers and the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America (as in effect on the day before the date of the adop-tion of Standard 90.1–2010 of such Societies) or any successor standard. Effective date.—The increased dollar limita-tions under section 179 apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. The expansion of qualified real property to include qualified energy efficient heating and air-conditioning property applies to property acquired
619and placed in service after November 2, 2017. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The provision increases the maximum amount a taxpayer may expense under sec-tion 179 to $1,000,000, and increases the phase- out threshold amount to $2,500,000. Thus, the provision provides that the maximum amount a taxpayer may expense, for taxable years beginning after 2017, is $1,000,000 of the cost of qualifying property placed in service for the taxable year. The $1,000,000 amount is reduced (but not below zero) by the amount by which the cost of qualifying property placed in service during the taxable year ex-ceeds $2,500,000. The $1,000,000 and $2,500,000 amounts, as well as the $25,000 sport utility vehicle limitation, are indexed for inflation for taxable years beginning after 2018. The provision expands the definition of section 179 property to include certain depre-ciable tangible personal property used pre-dominantly to furnish lodging or in connec-tion with furnishing lodging.
620 The provision also expands the definition of qualified real property eligible for section 179 expensing to include any of the following improvements to nonresidential real prop-erty placed in service after the date such property was first placed in service: roofs; heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning property; fire protection and alarm systems; and security systems. Effective date.—The provision applies to property placed in service in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the Sen-ate amendment. 2. Small business accounting method reform and simplification (sec. 3202 of the House bill, secs. 13102 through 13105 of the Senate amendment, and secs. 263A, 448, 460, and 471 of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  General rule for methods of accounting Section 446 generally allows a taxpayer to select the method of accounting to be used to compute taxable income, provided that such method clearly reflects the income of the taxpayer. The term ‘‘method of account-ing’’ includes not only the overall method of accounting used by the taxpayer, but also the accounting treatment of any one item.621 Permissible overall methods of accounting include the cash receipts and disbursements method (‘‘cash method’’), an accrual method, or any other method (including a hybrid method) permitted under regulations pre-scribed by the Secretary.
622Examples of any one item for which an accounting method may be adopted include cost recovery,
623rev- enue recognition,
624and timing of deduc-tions.
625For each separate trade or business, a taxpayer is entitled to adopt any permis-sible method, subject to certain restric-tions.
626 A taxpayer filing its first return may adopt any permissible method of accounting in computing taxable income for such year.
627Except as otherwise provided, sec-tion 446(e) requires taxpayers to secure con-sent of the Secretary before changing a method of accounting. The regulations under this section provide rules for determining: (1) what a method of accounting is, (2) how an adoption of a method of accounting oc-curs, and (3) how a change in method of ac-counting is effectuated.
628 Cash and accrual methods Taxpayers using the cash method generally recognize items of income when actually or constructively received and items of expense when paid. The cash method is administra-tively easy and provides the taxpayer flexi-bility in the timing of income recognition. It is the method generally used by most indi-vidual taxpayers, including farm and non-farm sole proprietorships. Taxpayers using an accrual method gen-erally accrue items of income when all the events have occurred that fix the right to re-ceive the income and the amount of the in-come can be determined with reasonable ac-curacy.
629Taxpayers using an accrual meth-od of accounting generally may not deduct items of expense prior to when all events have occurred that fix the obligation to pay the liability, the amount of the liability can be determined with reasonable accuracy, and economic performance has occurred.
630Ac- crual methods of accounting generally result in a more accurate measure of economic in-come than does the cash method. The ac-crual method is often used by businesses for financial accounting purposes. A C corporation, a partnership that has a C corporation as a partner, or a tax-exempt trust or corporation with unrelated business income generally may not use the cash method. Exceptions are made for farming businesses, qualified personal service cor-porations, and the aforementioned entities to the extent their average annual gross re-ceipts do not exceed $5 million for all prior years (including the prior taxable years of any predecessor of the entity) (the ‘‘gross re-ceipts test’’). The cash method may not be used by any tax shelter.
631In addition, the cash method generally may not be used if the purchase, production, or sale of merchan-dise is an income producing factor.632Such taxpayers generally are required to keep in-ventories and use an accrual method with re-spect to inventory items.
633 A farming business is defined as a trade or business of farming, including operating a nursery or sod farm, or the raising or har-vesting of trees bearing fruit, nuts, or other crops, timber, or ornamental trees.
634Such farming businesses are not precluded from using the cash method regardless of whether they meet the gross receipts test. However, section 447 generally requires a farming C corporation (and any farming partnership if a corporation is a partner in such partner-ship) to use an accrual method of account-ing. Section 447 does not apply to nursery or sod farms, to the raising or harvesting of trees (other than fruit and nut trees), nor to farming C corporations meeting a gross re-ceipts test with a $1 million threshold. For family farm C corporations, the threshold under the gross receipts test is $25 million. A qualified personal service corporation is a corporation: (1) substantially all of whose activities involve the performance of serv-ices in the fields of health, law, engineering, architecture, accounting, actuarial science, performing arts, or consulting, and (2) sub-stantially all of the stock of which is owned by current or former employees performing such services, their estates, or heirs.
635 Qualified personal service corporations are allowed to use the cash method without re-gard to whether they meet the gross receipts test. Accounting for inventories In general, for Federal income tax pur-poses, taxpayers must account for inven-tories if the production, purchase, or sale of merchandise is an income-producing factor to the taxpayer.
636Treasury regulations also provide that in any case in which the use of inventories is necessary to clearly reflect in-come, the accrual method must be used with regard to purchases and sales.
637However, an exception is provided for taxpayers whose av-erage annual gross receipts do not exceed $1 million.
638A second exception is provided for taxpayers in certain industries whose aver-age annual gross receipts do not exceed $10 million and that are not otherwise prohib-ited from using the cash method under sec-tion 448.
639Such taxpayers may account for inventory as materials and supplies that are not incidental (i.e., ‘‘non-incidental mate-rials and supplies’’).
640 In those circumstances in which a tax-payer is required to account for inventory, the taxpayer must maintain inventory records to determine the cost of goods sold during the taxable period. Cost of goods sold

641Sec. 263A. 
642Sec. 263A(b)(2)(B). No exception is available for small taxpayers who produce property subject to section 263A. However, a de minimis rule under Treas- ury regulations treats producers with total indirect costs of $200,000 or less as having no additional indi-rect costs beyond those normally capitalized for fi-nancial accounting purposes. Treas. Reg. sec. 1.263A– 2(b)(3)(iv). 
643Sec. 263A(c)(5).

645Sec. 263A(h). Qualified creative expenses are de-fined as amounts paid or incurred by an individual in the trade or business of being a writer, photog-rapher, or artist. However, such term does not in-clude any expense related to printing, photographic plates, motion picture files, video tapes, or similar items. 
646Sec. 460(a). 
647See Treas. Reg. sec. 1.460–4. This calculation is done on a cumulative basis. Thus, the amount in-cluded in gross income in a particular year is that proportion of the expected contract price that the amount of costs incurred through the end of the tax-able year bears to the total expected costs, reduced by the amounts of gross contract price included in gross income in previous taxable years. 648Sec. 460(b)(1).

652Secs. 460(e)(1)(B) and (4). 
653Since such contracts involve the construction of real property, they are subject to the interest capitalization rules without regard to their dura-tion. See Treas. Reg. sec. 1.263A–8. 
654Treas. Reg. sec. 1.460–4(c)(1). 
655Consistent with present law, the cash method generally may not be used by taxpayers, other than those that meet the $25 million gross receipts test, if the purchase, production, or sale of merchandise is an income-producing factor. In addition, the cash method may not be used by a tax shelter. 656In the case of a sole proprietorship, the $25 mil-lion gross receipts test is applied as if the sole pro-prietorship is a corporation or partnership. 
657Consistent with present law, a deduction is gen-erally permitted for the cost of non-incidental mate-rials and supplies in the taxable year in which they are first used or are consumed in the taxpayer’s op-erations. See Treas. Reg. sec. 1.162–3(a)(1). 
658The taxpayer’s financial accounting treatment of inventories is determined by reference to the method of accounting used in the taxpayer’s appli-cable financial statement (as defined in section 3202 of the House bill (Small business accounting method reform and simplification)) or, if the taxpayer does not have an applicable financial statement, the method of accounting used in the taxpayer’s book and records prepared in accordance with the tax-payer’s accounting procedures. 
659In the case of a sole proprietorship, the $25 mil-lion gross receipts test is applied as if the sole pro-prietorship is a corporation or partnership. 
660In the case of a sole proprietorship, the $25 mil-lion gross receipts test is applied as if the sole pro-prietorship is a corporation or partnership. generally is determined by adding the tax-payer’s inventory at the beginning of the pe-riod to the purchases made during the period and subtracting from that sum the tax-payer’s inventory at the end of the period. Because of the difficulty of accounting for inventory on an item-by-item basis, tax-payers often use conventions that assume certain item or cost flows. Among these con-ventions are the first-in, first-out (‘‘FIFO’’) method, which assumes that the items in ending inventory are those most recently ac-quired by the taxpayer, and the last-in, first- out (‘‘LIFO’’) method, which assumes that the items in ending inventory are those ear-liest acquired by the taxpayer. Uniform capitalization The uniform capitalization rules require certain direct and indirect costs allocable to real or tangible personal property produced by the taxpayer to be included in either in-ventory or capitalized into the basis of such property, as applicable.
641For real or per-sonal property acquired by the taxpayer for resale, section 263A generally requires cer-tain direct and indirect costs allocable to such property to be included in inventory. Section 263A provides a number of excep-tions to the general uniform capitalization requirements. One such exception exists for certain small taxpayers who acquire prop-erty for resale and have $10 million or less of average annual gross receipts;
642such tax- payers are not required to include additional section 263A costs in inventory. Another ex-ception exists for taxpayers who raise, har-vest, or grow trees.
643Under this exception, section 263A does not apply to trees raised, harvested, or grown by the taxpayer (other than trees bearing fruit, nuts, or other crops, or ornamental trees) and any real property underlying such trees. Similarly, the uni-form capitalization rules do not apply to any plant having a preproductive period of two years or less or to any animal, which is pro-duced by a taxpayer in a farming business (unless the taxpayer is required to use an ac-crual method of accounting under section 447 or 448(a)(3)).
644Freelance authors, photog-raphers, and artists also are exempt from section 263A for any qualified creative ex-penses.
645 Accounting for long-term contracts In general, in the case of a long-term con-tract, the taxable income from the contract is determined under the percentage-of-com-pletion method.
646Under this method, the taxpayer must include in gross income for the taxable year an amount equal to the product of (1) the gross contract price and (2) the percentage of the contract completed during the taxable year.
647The percentage of the contract completed during the taxable year is determined by comparing costs allo-cated to the contract and incurred before the end of the taxable year with the estimated total contract costs.648Costs allocated to the contract typically include all costs (includ-ing depreciation) that directly benefit or are incurred by reason of the taxpayer’s long- term contract activities.
649The allocation of costs to a contract is made in accordance with regulations.
650Costs incurred with re-spect to the long-term contract are deduct-ible in the year incurred, subject to general accrual method of accounting principles and limitations.
651 An exception from the requirement to use the percentage-of-completion method is pro-vided for certain construction contracts (‘‘small construction contracts’’). Contracts within this exception are those contracts for the construction or improvement of real property if the contract: (1) is expected (at the time such contract is entered into) to be completed within two years of commence-ment of the contract and (2) is performed by a taxpayer whose average annual gross re-ceipts for the prior three taxable years do not exceed $10 million.
652Thus, long-term contract income from small construction contracts must be reported consistently using the taxpayer’s exempt contract meth-od.
653Permissible exempt contract methods include the completed contract method, the exempt-contract percentage-of-completion method, the percentage-of-completion meth-od, or any other permissible method.

HOUSE BILL  The provision expands the universe of tax-payers that may use the cash method of ac-counting. Under the provision, the cash method of accounting may be used by tax-payers, other than tax shelters, that satisfy the gross receipts test, regardless of whether the purchase, production, or sale of merchan-dise is an income-producing factor. The gross receipts test allows taxpayers with annual average gross receipts that do not exceed $25 million for the three prior taxable-year pe-riod (the ‘‘$25 million gross receipts test’’) to use the cash method. The $25 million amount is indexed for inflation for taxable years be-ginning after 2018. The provision expands the universe of farming C corporations (and farming part-nerships with a C corporation partner) that may use the cash method to include any farming C corporation (or farming partner-ship with a C corporation partner) that meets the $25 million gross receipts test. The provision retains the exceptions from the required use of the accrual method for qualified personal service corporations and taxpayers other than C corporations. Thus, qualified personal service corporations, part-nerships without C corporation partners, S corporations, and other passthrough entities are allowed to use the cash method without regard to whether they meet the $25 million gross receipts test, so long as the use of such method clearly reflects income.
655 In addition, the provision also exempts cer-tain taxpayers from the requirement to keep inventories. Specifically, taxpayers that meet the $25 million gross receipts test are not required to account for inventories under section 471656, but rather may use a method of accounting for inventories that either (1) treats inventories as non-incidental mate-rials and supplies
657, or (2) conforms to the taxpayer’s financial accounting treatment of inventories.
658 The provision expands the exception for small taxpayers from the uniform capitaliza-tion rules. Under the provision, any producer or reseller that meets the $25 million gross receipts test is exempted from the applica-tion of section 263A.
659The provision retains the exemptions from the uniform capitaliza-tion rules that are not based on a taxpayer’s gross receipts. Finally, the provision expands the excep-tion for small construction contracts from the requirement to use the percentage-of- completion method. Under the provision, contracts within this exception are those contracts for the construction or improve-ment of real property if the contract: (1) is expected (at the time such contract is en-tered into) to be completed within two years of commencement of the contract and (2) is performed by a taxpayer that (for the tax-able year in which the contract was entered into) meets the $25 million gross receipts test.
660 Under the provision, a taxpayer who fails the $25 million gross receipts test would not be eligible for any of the aforementioned ex-ceptions (i.e., from the accrual method, from keeping inventories, from applying the uni-form capitalization rules, or from using the percentage-of completion method) for such taxable year. Application of the provisions to expand the universe of taxpayers eligible to use the cash method, exempt certain taxpayers from the requirement to keep inventories, and expand the exception from the uniform capitaliza-tion rules is a change in the taxpayer’s method of accounting for purposes of section 481. Application of the exception for small construction contracts from the requirement to use the percentage-of-completion method is applied on a cutoff basis for all similarly classified contracts (hence there is no ad-justment under section 481(a) for contracts entered into before January 1, 2018). Effective date.—The provisions to expand the universe of taxpayers eligible to use the cash method, exempt certain taxpayers from the requirement to keep inventories, and ex-pand the exception from the uniform capital-ization rules apply to taxable years begin-ning after December 31, 2017. The provision to expand the exception for small construc-tion contracts from the requirement to use the percentage-of-completion method applies to contracts entered into after December 31, 2017, in taxable years ending after such date.

CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the House bill. 3. Modification of treatment of S corporation conversions to C corporations (sec. 3204 of the House bill, sec. 13543 of the Senate amendment, and secs. 481 and 1371 of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  Changes in accounting method Cash and accrual methods in general Taxpayers using the cash method generally recognize items of income when actually or constructively received and items of expense when paid. The cash method is administra-tively easy and provides the taxpayer flexi-bility in the timing of income recognition. It is the method generally used by most indi-vidual taxpayers, including farm and non-farm sole proprietorships. Taxpayers using an accrual method gen-erally accrue items of income when all the events have occurred that fix the right to re-ceive the income and the amount of the in-come can be determined with reasonable ac-curacy.
661Taxpayers using an accrual meth-od of accounting generally may not deduct items of expense prior to when all events have occurred that fix the obligation to pay the liability, the amount of the liability can be determined with reasonable accuracy, and economic performance has occurred.
662Ac- crual methods of accounting generally result in a more accurate measure of economic in-come than does the cash method. The ac-crual method is often used by businesses for financial accounting purposes. A C corporation, a partnership that has a C corporation as a partner, or a tax-exempt trust or corporation with unrelated business income generally may not use the cash method. Exceptions are made for farming businesses,
663qualified personal service cor-porations,
664and the aforementioned entities to the extent their average annual gross re-ceipts do not exceed $5 million for all prior years (including the prior taxable years of any predecessor of the entity) (the ‘‘gross re-ceipts test’’).665The cash method may not be used by any tax shelter.
666In addition, the cash method generally may not be used if the purchase, production, or sale of merchan-dise is an income producing factor.
667Such taxpayers generally are required to keep in-ventories and use an accrual method with re-spect to inventory items.
668 Procedures for changing a method of account-ing A taxpayer filing its first return may adopt any permissible method of accounting in computing taxable income for such year.
669Except as otherwise provided, sec-tion 446(e) requires taxpayers to secure con-sent of the Secretary before changing a method of accounting. The regulations under this section provide rules for determining: (1) what a method of accounting is, (2) how an adoption of a method of accounting oc-curs, and (3) how a change in method of ac-counting is effectuated.
670 Section 481 prescribes the rules to be fol-lowed in computing taxable income in cases where the taxable income of the taxpayer is computed under a different method than the prior year (e.g., when changing from the cash method to an accrual method). In computing taxable income for the year of change, the taxpayer must take into account those ad-justments which are determined to be nec-essary solely by reason of such change in order to prevent items of income or expense from being duplicated or omitted.
671The year of change is the taxable year for which the taxable income of the taxpayer is com-puted under a different method than the prior year.
672Congress has provided the Sec-retary with the authority to prescribe the timing and manner in which such adjust-ments are taken into account in computing taxable income.
673Net adjustments that de-crease taxable income generally are taken into account entirely in the year of change, and net adjustments that increase taxable income generally are taken into account rat-ably during the four-taxable-year period be-ginning with the year of change.674 Post-termination distributions Under present law, in the case of an S cor-poration that converts to a C corporation, distributions of cash by the C corporation to its shareholders during the post-termination transition period (to the extent of the amount in the accumulated adjustment ac-count) are tax-free to the shareholders and reduce the adjusted basis of the stock.
675The post-termination transition period is gen-erally the one-year period after the S cor-poration election terminates.
676 
HOUSE BILL  Under the provision, any section 481(a) ad-justment of an eligible terminated S cor-poration attributable to the revocation of its S corporation election (i.e., a change from the cash method to an accrual method) is taken into account ratably during the six- taxable-year period beginning with the year of change.
677An eligible terminated S cor-poration is any C corporation which (1) is an S corporation the day before the enactment of this bill, (2) during the two-year period be-ginning on the date of such enactment re-vokes its S corporation election under sec-tion 1362(a), and (3) all of the owners of which on the date the S corporation election is revoked are the same owners (and in iden-tical proportions) as the owners on the date of such enactment. Under the provision, in the case of a dis-tribution of money by an eligible terminated S corporation, the accumulated adjustments account shall be allocated to such distribu-tion, and the distribution shall be chargeable to accumulated earnings and profits, in the same ratio as the amount of the accumu-lated adjustments account bears to the amount the accumulated earnings and prof-its. Effective date.—The provision is effective upon enactment. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The Senate amendment generally is the same as the House bill, except that any in-crease in tax due to the section 481(a) adjust-ment, rather than the section 481(a) adjust-ment itself, is taken into account ratably during the six-taxable-year period beginning with the year of change. Effective date.—The provision is effective for distributions after the date of enactment.

678Sec. 163(a). In addition to the limitations dis-cussed herein, other limitations include: denial of the deduction for the disqualified portion of the original issue discount on an applicable high yield discount obligation (sec. 163(e)(5)), denial of deduc-tion for interest on certain obligations not in reg-istered form (sec. 163(f)), reduction of the deduction for interest on indebtedness with respect to which a mortgage credit certificate has been issued under section 25 (sec. 163(g)), disallowance of deduction for personal interest (sec. 163(h)), disallowance of deduc-tion for interest on debt with respect to certain life insurance contracts (sec. 264), and disallowance of deduction for interest relating to tax-exempt in-come (sec. 265). Interest may also be subject to cap-italization. See, e.g., sections 263A(f) and 461(g). 
679Sec. 163(e). But see section 267 (dealing in part with interest paid to a related or foreign party). 
680Sec. 163(d). 
681Sec. 67(a). 
682Miscellaneous itemized deductions include itemized deductions of individuals other than cer-tain specific itemized deductions. Sec. 67(b). Mis-cellaneous itemized deductions generally include, for example, investment management fees and cer-tain employee business expenses, but specifically do not include, for example, interest, taxes, casualty and theft losses, charitable contributions, medical expenses, or other listed itemized deductions. 
683H.R. Rep. No. 841, 99th Cong., 2d Sess., p. II–154, Sept. 18, 1986 (Conf. Rep.) (‘‘In computing the amount of expenses that exceed the 2-percent floor, expenses that are not investment expenses are in-tended to be disallowed before any investment ex-penses are disallowed.’’). 684If a tax treaty reduces the rate of tax on inter-est paid or accrued by the taxpayer, the interest is treated as interest on which no Federal income tax is imposed to the extent of the same proportion of such interest as the rate of tax imposed without re-gard to the treaty, reduced by the rate of tax im-posed by the treaty, bears to the rate of tax imposed without regard to the treaty.

685Sec. 163(j)(3). 
686Sec. 163(j)(1)(B). 
687Sec. 163(j)(2)(B)(ii). 
688Section 163(d) applies in the case of a taxpayer other than a corporation. Thus, a corporation has neither investment interest nor investment income within the meaning of section 163(d). Thus, interest income and interest expense of a corporation is properly allocable to a trade or business, unless such trade or business is otherwise explicitly excluded from the application of the provision. 
689Any deduction allowable for depreciation, amor-tization, or depletion includes any deduction allow-able for any amount treated as depreciation, amorti-zation, or depletion under present law. 690This amount is the ‘‘Ordinary business income or loss’’ reflected on Form 1065 (U.S. Return of Part-nership Income). The partner’s distributive share is reflected in Box 1 of Schedule K–1 (Form 1065). taxable income subject to a number of limi-tations.
678 Interest is generally deducted by a tax-payer as it is paid or accrued, depending on the taxpayer’s method of accounting. For all taxpayers, if an obligation is issued with original issue discount (‘‘OID’’), a deduction for interest is allowable over the life of the obligation on a yield to maturity basis.
679 Generally, OID arises where interest on a debt instrument is not calculated based on a qualified rate and required to be paid at least annually. Investment interest expense In the case of a taxpayer other than a cor-poration, the deduction for interest on in-debtedness that is allocable to property held for investment (‘‘investment interest’’) is limited to the taxpayer’s net investment in-come for the taxable year.
680Disallowed in-vestment interest is carried forward to the next taxable year. Net investment income is investment in-come net of investment expenses. Invest-ment income generally consists of gross in-come from property held for investment, and investment expense includes all deductions directly connected with the production of in-vestment income (e.g., deductions for invest-ment management fees) other than deduc-tions for interest. The two-percent floor on miscellaneous itemized deductions allows taxpayers to de-duct investment expenses connected with in-vestment income only to the extent such de-ductions exceed two percent of the tax-payer’s adjusted gross income (‘‘AGI’’).
681 Miscellaneous itemized deductions
682that are not investment expenses are disallowed first before any investment expenses are dis-allowed.
683 Earnings stripping Section 163(j) may disallow a deduction for disqualified interest paid or accrued by a corporation in a taxable year if two thresh-old tests are satisfied: the payor’s debt-to-eq-uity ratio exceeds 1.5 to 1.0 (the safe harbor ratio) and the payor’s net interest expense exceeds 50 percent of its adjusted taxable in-come (generally, taxable income computed without regard to deductions for net interest expense, net operating losses, domestic pro-duction activities under section 199, depre-ciation, amortization, and depletion). Dis-qualified interest includes interest paid or accrued to: (1) related parties when no Fed-eral income tax is imposed with respect to such interest;684(2) unrelated parties in cer-tain instances in which a related party guar-antees the debt; or (3) to a real estate invest-ment trust (‘‘REIT’’) by a taxable REIT sub-sidiary of that trust.
685Interest amounts dis-allowed under these rules can be carried for-ward indefinitely.
686In addition, any excess limitation (i.e., the excess, if any, of 50 per-cent of the adjusted taxable income of the payor over the payor’s net interest expense) can be carried forward three years.
687 
HOUSE BILL  In general In the case of any taxpayer for any taxable year, the deduction for business interest is limited to the sum of (1) business interest in-come; (2) 30 percent of the adjusted taxable income of the taxpayer for the taxable year; and (3) the floor plan financing interest of the taxpayer for the taxable year. The amount of any business interest not allowed as a deduction for any taxable year may be carried forward for up to five years beyond the year in which the business interest was paid or accrued, treating business interest as allowed as a deduction on a first-in, first-out basis. The limitation applies at the taxpayer level. In the case of a group of affiliated cor-porations that file a consolidated return, the limitation applies at the consolidated tax re-turn filing level. Business interest means any interest paid or accrued on indebtedness properly allo-cable to a trade or business. Any amount treated as interest for purposes of the Inter-nal Revenue Code is interest for purposes of the provision. Business interest income means the amount of interest includible in the gross income of the taxpayer for the tax-able year which is properly allocable to a trade or business. Business interest does not include investment interest, and business in-terest income does not include investment income, within the meaning of section 163(d).
688 Adjusted taxable income means the tax-able income of the taxpayer computed with-out regard to (1) any item of income, gain, deduction, or loss which is not properly allo-cable to a trade or business; (2) any business interest or business interest income; (3) the amount of any net operating loss deduction; and (4) any deduction allowable for deprecia-tion, amortization, or depletion.
689The Sec- retary may provide other adjustments to the computation of adjusted taxable income. Floor plan financing interest means inter-est paid or accrued on floor plan financing indebtedness. Floor plan financing indebted-ness means indebtedness used to finance the acquisition of motor vehicles held for sale to retail customers and secured by the inven-tory so acquired. A motor vehicle means a motor vehicle that is an automobile, a truck, a recreational vehicle, a motorcycle, a boat, farm machinery or equipment, or construc-tion machinery or equipment. By including business interest income and floor plan financing interest in the limita-tion, the rule operates to allow floor plan fi-nancing interest to be fully deductible and to limit the deduction for net interest expense (less floor plan financing interest) to 30 per-cent of adjusted taxable income. That is, a deduction for business interest is permitted to the full extent of business interest income and any floor plan financing interest. To the extent that business interest exceeds busi-ness interest income and floor plan financing interest, the deduction for the net interest expense is limited to 30 percent of adjusted taxable income. It is generally intended that, similar to present law, section 163(j) apply after the ap-plication of provisions that subject interest to deferral, capitalization, or other limita-tion. Thus, section 163(j) applies to interest deductions that are deferred, for example under section 163(e) or section 267(a)(3)(B), in the taxable year to which such deductions are deferred. Section 163(j) applies after sec-tion 263A is applied to capitalize interest and after, for example, section 265 or section 279 is applied to disallow interest. Application to passthrough entities In general In the case of any partnership, the limita-tion is applied at the partnership level. Any deduction for business interest is taken into account in determining the nonseparately stated taxable income or loss of the partner-ship.690To prevent double counting, special rules are provided for the determination of the adjusted taxable income of each partner of the partnership. Similarly, to allow for additional interest deduction by a partner in the case of an excess amount of unused ad-justed taxable income limitation of the part-nership, special rules apply. Similar rules apply with respect to any S corporation and its shareholders. Double counting rule The adjusted taxable income of each part-ner (or shareholder, as the case may be) is determined without regard to such partner’s distributive share of the nonseparately stat-ed income or loss of such partnership. In the absence of such a rule, the same dollars of adjusted taxable income of a partnership could generate additional interest deduc-tions as the income is passed through to the partners. Example 1.—ABC is a partnership owned 50– 50 by XYZ Corporation and an individual. ABC generates $200 of noninterest income. Its only expense is $60 of business interest. Under the provision the deduction for busi-ness interest is limited to 30 percent of ad-justed taxable income, that is, 30 percent * $200 = $60. ABC deducts $60 of business inter-est and reports ordinary business income of $140. XYZ’s distributive share of the ordinary business income of ABC is $70. XYZ has net taxable income of zero from its other oper-ations, none of which is attributable to in-terest income and without regard to its busi-ness interest expense. XYZ has business in-terest expense of $25. In the absence of any special rule, the $70 of taxable income from its interest in ABC would permit the deduc-tion of up to an additional $21 of interest (30 percent * $70 = $21), resulting in a deduction disallowance of only $4. XYZ’s $100 share of ABC’s adjusted taxable income would gen-erate $51 of interest deductions. If XYZ were

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H10047 December 15, 2017 
691See section 4302 of the bill (Limitation on de-duction of interest by domestic corporations which are members of an international financial reporting group). 
692In the case of a sole proprietorship, the $25 mil-lion gross receipts test is applied as if the sole pro-prietorship were a corporation or partnership. 693The term ‘‘State’’ includes the District of Co-lumbia. See sec. 7701(a)(10) (‘‘The term ‘State’ shall be construed to include the District of Columbia where such construction is necessary to carry out provisions of this title’’). 
694The deduction for income attributable to do-mestic production activities is repealed effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2018. See section 13305 of the Senate amendment (Repeal of deduction for income attributable to domestic pro-duction activities). 
695See section 11011 of the Senate amendment (De-duction for qualified business income). 696See section 13102 of the Senate amendment (Modifications of gross receipts test for use of cash method of accounting by corporations and partner-ships). In the case of a sole proprietorship, the $15 million gross receipts test is applied as if the sole proprietorship were a corporation or partnership. instead a passthrough entity, additional de-ductions could be available at each tier. The double counting rule provides that XYZ has adjusted taxable income computed without regard to the $70 distributive share of the nonseparately stated income of ABC. As a result, XYZ has adjusted taxable in-come of $0. XYZ’s deduction for business in-terest is limited to 30 percent * $0 = $0, re-sulting in a deduction disallowance of $25. Additional deduction limit The limit on the amount allowed as a de-duction for business interest is increased by a partner’s distributive share of the partner-ship’s excess amount of unused adjusted tax-able income limitation. The excess amount with respect to any partnership is the excess (if any) of 30 percent of the adjusted taxable income of the partnership over the amount (if any) by which the business interest of the partnership (reduced by floor plan financing interest) exceeds the business interest in-come of the partnership. This allows a part-ner of a partnership to deduct more interest expense the partner may have paid or in-curred to the extent the partnership could have deducted more business interest. Example 2.—The facts are the same as in Example 1 except ABC has only $40 of busi-ness interest. As in Example 1, ABC has a limit on its interest deduction of $60. The ex-cess amount for ABC is $60 ¥$40 = $20. XYZ’s distributive share of the excess amount from ABC partnership is $10. XYZ’s deduction for business interest is limited to 30 percent of its adjusted taxable income plus its distribu-tive share of the excess amount from ABC partnership (30 percent * $0 + $10 = $10). As a result of the rule, XYZ may deduct $10 of business interest and has an interest deduc-tion disallowance of $15. Carryforward of disallowed business interest The amount of any business interest not allowed as a deduction for any taxable year is treated as business interest paid or ac-crued in the succeeding taxable year. Busi-ness interest may be carried forward for up to five years. Carryforwards are determined on a first-in, first-out basis. It is intended that the provision be administered in a way to prevent trafficking in carryforwards. A coordination rule is provided with the limitation on deduction of interest by do-mestic corporations in international finan-cial reporting groups.
691Whichever rule im-poses the lower limitation on deduction of business interest with respect to the taxable year (and therefore the greatest amount of interest to be carried forward) governs. Any carryforward of disallowed business interest is an item taken into account in the case of certain corporate acquisitions de-scribed in section 381 and is subject to limi-tation under section 382. Exceptions The limitation does not apply to any tax-payer that meets the $25 million gross re-ceipts test of section 448(c), that is, if the av-erage annual gross receipts for the three-tax-able-year period ending with the prior tax-able year does not exceed $25 million.
692Ag- gregation rules apply to determine the amount of a taxpayer’s gross receipts under the gross receipts test of section 448(c). The trade or business of performing serv-ices as an employee is not treated as a trade or business for purposes of the limitation. As a result, for example, the wages of an em-ployee are not counted in the adjusted tax-able income of the taxpayer for purposes of determining the limitation. The limitation does not apply to a real property trade or business as defined in sec-tion 469(c)(7)(C). Any real property develop-ment, redevelopment, construction, recon-struction, acquisition, conversion, rental, operation, management, leasing, or broker-age trade or business is not treated as a trade or business for purposes of the limita-tion. The limitation does not apply to certain regulated public utilities. Specifically, the trade or business of the furnishing or sale of (1) electrical energy, water, or sewage dis-posal services, (2) gas or steam through a local distribution system, or (3) transpor-tation of gas or steam by pipeline, if the rates for such furnishing or sale, as the case may be, have been established or approved by a State693or political subdivision thereof, by any agency or instrumentality of the United States, or by a public service or pub-lic utility commission or other similar body of any State or political subdivision thereof is not treated as a trade or business for pur-poses of the limitation. As a result, for ex-ample, interest expense paid or incurred in a real property trade or business is not busi-ness interest subject to limitation and is generally deductible in the computation of taxable income. Effective date.—The provision applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The Senate amendment is the same as the House bill, with the following modifications. In general The Senate amendment makes several changes to the definition of adjusted taxable income. Specifically, the Senate amendment does not add back deductions allowable for depreciation, amortization, or depletion, but does add back any deduction under section 199,
694and any deduction under section 199A with respect to qualified business income of a passthrough entity.
695 The Senate amendment also modifies the definition of floor plan financing. Specifi-cally, the Senate amendment permits inter-est on indebtedness used to finance acquisi-tion of motor vehicles for sale or lease ( i.e., not just for sale, as in the House bill) to qualify as floor plan financing interest. The Senate amendment also includes self-pro-pelled vehicles in the definition of motor ve-hicle, but removes construction machinery and equipment from the definition. Carryforward of disallowed business interest The Senate amendment permits interest deductions to be carried forward indefi-nitely, subject to certain restrictions appli-cable to partnerships, described below. Application to passthrough entities The Senate amendment requires a partner in a partnership to ignore the partner’s dis-tributive share of all items of income, gain, deduction, or loss of the partnership when calculating adjusted taxable income (rather than merely ignoring the nonseparately stat-ed income or loss, as in the House bill). The Senate amendment takes a different mathematical approach from the House bill to calculating a partner’s interest limita-tion, though both provisions have the same practical effect. In the Senate amendment, the limit on the amount allowed as a deduc-tion for business interest is increased by a partner’s distributive share of the partner-ship’s excess taxable income. The excess tax-able income with respect to any partnership is the amount which bears the same ratio to the partnership’s adjusted taxable income as the excess (if any) of 30 percent of the ad-justed taxable income of the partnership over the amount (if any) by which the busi-ness interest of the partnership, reduced by floor plan financing interest, exceeds the business interest income of the partnership bears to 30 percent of the adjusted taxable income of the partnership. This allows a partner of a partnership to deduct additional interest expense the partner may have paid or incurred to the extent the partnership could have deducted more business interest. The Senate amendment requires that excess taxable income be allocated in the same manner as nonseparately stated income and loss. As in the House bill, rules similar to these rules also apply to S corporations. The Senate amendment provides a special rule for carryforward of disallowed partner-ship interest. In the case of a partnership, the general carryforward rule described in the discussion of the House bill does not apply. Instead, any business interest that is not allowed as a deduction to the partner-ship for the taxable year is allocated to each partner in the same manner as nonsepa-rately stated taxable income or loss of the partnership. The partner may deduct its share of the partnership’s excess business in-terest in any future year, but only against excess taxable income attributed to the part-ner by the partnership the activities of which gave rise to the excess business inter-est carryforward. Any such deduction re-quires a corresponding reduction in excess taxable income. Additionally, when excess business interest is allocated to a partner, the partner’s basis in its partnership interest is reduced (but not below zero) by the amount of such allocation, even though the carryforward does not give rise to a partner deduction in the year of the basis reduction. However, the partner’s deduction in a future year for interest carried forward does not re-duce the partner’s basis in the partnership interest. In the event the partner disposes of a partnership interest the basis of which has been so reduced, the partner’s basis in such interest shall be increased, immediately be-fore such disposition, by the amount that any such basis reductions exceed any amount of excess interest expense that has been treated as paid by the partner (i.e., ex-cess interest expense that has been deducted by the partner against excess taxable income of the same partnership). This special rule does not apply to S corporations and their shareholders. Exceptions The Senate amendment exempts certain categories of taxpayers or trades or busi-nesses from the interest limitation. First, any taxpayer that meets the $15 million gross receipts test of section 448(c) is exempt from the interest limitation.
696Second, the Senate amendment expands the regulated public utilities exception in the House bill to include utilities where the rates for such fur-nishing or sale, as the case may be, have

697It is intended that any such real property trade or business, including such a trade or business con-ducted by a corporation or real estate investment trust, be included. Because this description of a real property trade or business refers only to the section 469(c)(7)(C) description, and not to other rules of sec-tion 469 (such as the rule of section 469(c)(2) that passive activities include rental activities or the rule of section 469(a) that a passive activity loss is limited under section 469), the other rules of section 469 are not made applicable by this reference. It is further intended that a real property operation or a real property management trade or business in-cludes the operation or management of a lodging fa-cility. 
698As defined in section 263A(e)(4) (i.e., farming business means the trade or business of farming and includes the trade or business of operating a nursery or sod farm, or the raising or harvesting of trees bearing fruit, nuts, or other crops, or ornamental trees (other than evergreen trees that are more than six years old at the time they are severed from their roots)). Treas. Reg. sec. 1.263A–4(a)(4) further defines a farming business as a trade or business involving the cultivation of land or the raising or harvesting of any agricultural or horticultural commodity. Ex-amples of a farming business include the trade or business of operating a nursery or sod farm; the rais-ing or harvesting of trees bearing fruit, nuts, or other crops; the raising of ornamental trees (other than evergreen trees that are more than six years old at the time they are severed from their roots); and the raising, shearing, feeding, caring for, train-ing, and management of animals. A farming busi-ness also includes processing activities that are nor-mally incident to the growing, raising, or harvesting of agricultural or horticultural products. See Treas. Reg. sec. 1.263A–4(a)(4)(i) and (ii). A farming business does not include contract harvesting of an agricul-tural or horticultural commodity grown or raised by another taxpayer, or merely buying and reselling plants or animals grown or raised by another tax-payer. See Treas. Reg. sec. 1.263A–4(a)(4)(i).

705Notwithstanding the amendments made by the provision and section 1304 of the House bill (Repeal of deduction for personal casualty losses), the provi-sion retains the present-law three-year carryback for the portion of the NOL for any taxable year which is a net disaster loss to which section 504(b) of the Disaster Tax Relief and Airport and Airway Ex-tension Act of 2017 (Pub. L. No. 115–63) applies (i.e., a net disaster loss arising from hurricane Harvey, Irma, or Maria). 
706See section 3101 of the House bill (Increased ex-pensing) for a limitation on the amount of any NOL which may be treated as an NOL carryback in the case of any year which includes any portion of the period beginning September 28, 2017 and ending De-cember 31, 2017. 707Sec. 1031(a)(1).

In the Senate amendment, at the tax-payer’s election, any real property develop-ment, redevelopment, construction, recon-struction, acquisition, conversion, rental, operation, management, leasing, or broker-age trade or business is not treated as a trade or business for purposes of the limita-tion, and therefore the limitation does not apply to such trades or businesses.
697Simi- larly, at the taxpayer’s election, any farming business,
698as well as any business engaged in the trade or business of a specified agri-cultural or horticultural cooperative,
699are not treated as trades or businesses for pur-poses of the limitation, and therefore the limitation does not apply to such trades or businesses. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement generally fol-lows the Senate amendment, with the fol-lowing modifications. Under the conference agreement, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2022, adjusted taxable income is computed with-out regard to deductions allowable for depre-ciation, amortization, or depletion. Addi-tionally, because the conference agreement repeals section 199 effective December 31, 2017, adjusted taxable income is computed without regard to such deduction. The con-ference agreement follows the House in ex-empting from the limitation taxpayers with average annual gross receipts for the three- taxable-year period ending with the prior taxable year that do not exceed $25 million. In addition, for purposes of defining floor plan financing, the conference agreement modifies the definition of motor vehicle by deleting the specific references to an auto-mobile, a truck, a recreational vehicle, and a motorcycle because those terms are encom-passed in the phrase, ‘‘any self-propelled ve-hicle designed for transporting persons or property on a public street, highway, or road,’’ which was also part of the definition in the Senate amendment. Effective date.—The provision applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 2. Modification of net operating loss deduc-tion (sec. 3302 of the House bill, sec. 13302 of the Senate amendment, and sec. 172 of the Code) PRESENT LAW  A net operating loss (‘‘NOL’’) generally means the amount by which a taxpayer’s business deductions exceed its gross in-come.
700In general, an NOL may be carried back two years and carried over 20 years to offset taxable income in such years.
701NOLs offset taxable income in the order of the tax-able years to which the NOL may be car-ried.
702 Different carryback periods apply with re-spect to NOLs arising in different cir-cumstances. Extended carryback periods are allowed for NOLs attributable to specified li-ability losses and certain casualty and dis-aster losses.
703Limitations are placed on the carryback of excess interest losses attrib-utable to corporate equity reduction trans-actions.
704 
HOUSE BILL  The provision limits the NOL deduction to 90 percent of taxable income (determined without regard to the deduction). Carryovers to other years are adjusted to take account of this limitation, and may be carried for-ward indefinitely. In addition, NOL carryovers attributable to losses arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, are increased annually to take into ac-count the time value of money. The provision repeals the two-year carryback and the special carryback provi-sions, but provides a one-year carryback in the case of certain disaster losses incurred in the trade or business of farming, or by cer-tain small businesses.
705For this purpose, small business means a corporation, partner-ship, or sole proprietorship whose average annual gross receipts for the three-taxable- year period ending with such taxable year does not exceed $5,000,000. Aggregation rules apply to determine gross receipts. Effective date.—The provision allowing in-definite carryovers and modifying carrybacks generally applies to losses aris-ing in taxable years beginning after Decem-ber 31, 2017.
706 The provision limiting the NOL deduction applies to taxable years beginning after De-cember 31, 2017. The annual increase in carryover amounts applies to taxable years beginning after De-cember 31, 2017. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The Senate amendment follows the House bill, with the following modifications. First, provision limits the NOL deduction to 80 per-cent of taxable income (determined without regard to the deduction), for losses arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2022. The limitation does not apply to a prop-erty and casualty insurance company. The provision repeals the two-year carryback and the special carryback provi-sions, but provides a two-year carryback in the case of certain losses incurred in the trade or business of farming. In addition, the Senate amendment provides a two-year carryback and 20-year carryforward for NOLs of a property and casualty insurance com-pany (defined in section 816(a)) as an insur-ance company other than a life insurance company). The provision does not increase NOL carryovers. Effective date.—The provision allowing in-definite carryovers and modifying carrybacks applies to losses arising in tax-able years beginning after December 31, 2017. The provision limiting the NOL deduction applies to losses arising in taxable years be-ginning after December 31, 2017. CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the Sen-ate amendment, except that the provision limits the NOL deduction to 80 percent of taxable income (determined without regard to the deduction) for losses arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 3. Like-kind exchanges of real property (sec. 3303 of the House bill, and sec. 13303 of the Senate amendment, and sec. 1031 of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  An exchange of property, like a sale, gen-erally is a taxable event. However, no gain or loss is recognized if property held for produc-tive use in a trade or business or for invest-ment is exchanged for property of a ‘‘like kind’’ which is to be held for productive use in a trade or business or for investment.
707In general, section 1031 does not apply to any exchange of stock in trade (i.e., inventory) or other property held primarily for sale; stocks, bonds, or notes; other securities or evidences of indebtedness or interest; inter-ests in a partnership; certificates of trust or beneficial interests; or choses in action.
708 Section 1031 also does not apply to certain exchanges involving livestock
709or foreign property.
710 For purposes of section 1031, the deter-mination of whether property is of a ‘‘like kind’’ relates to the nature or character of the property and not its grade or quality, i.e., the nonrecognition rules do not apply to an exchange of one class or kind of property for property of a different class or kind ( e.g., section 1031 does not apply to an exchange of real property for personal property).

712For example, an exchange of a personal com-puter classified under asset class 00.12 of Rev. Proc. 87–56, 1987–2 C.B. 674, for a printer classified under the same asset class of Rev. Proc. 87–56 would be treated as property of a like kind. However, an ex-change of an airplane classified under asset class 00.21 of Rev. Proc. 87–56 for a heavy general purpose truck classified under asset class 00.242 of Rev. Proc. 87–56 would not be treated as property of a like kind. See Treas. Reg. sec. 1.1031(a)–2(b)(7). 
713For example, an exchange of a copyright on a novel for a copyright on a different novel would be treated as property of a like kind. See Treas. Reg. sec. 1.1031(a)–2(c)(3). However, the goodwill or going concern value of one business is not of a like kind to the goodwill or going concern value of a different business. See Treas. Reg. sec. 1.1031(a)–2(c)(2). The Internal Revenue Service (‘‘IRS’’) has ruled that in-tangible assets such as trademarks, trade names, mastheads, and customer-based intangibles that can be separately described and valued apart from good-will qualify as property of a like kind under section 1031. See Chief Counsel Advice 200911006, February 12, 2009.

716Treasury Regulation section 1.1031(a)–2(b)(2) provides the following list of General Asset Classes, based on asset classes 00.11 through 00.28 and 00.4 of Rev. Proc. 87–56, 1987–2 C.B. 674: (i) Office furniture, fixtures, and equipment (asset class 00.11), (ii) Infor-mation systems (computers and peripheral equip-ment) (asset class 00.12), (iii) Data handling equip-ment, except computers (asset class 00.13), (iv) Air-planes (airframes and engines), except those used in commercial or contract carrying of passengers or freight, and all helicopters (airframes and engines) (asset class 00.21), (v) Automobiles, taxis (asset class 00.22), (vi) Buses (asset class 00.23), (vii) Light gen-eral purpose trucks (asset class 00.241), (viii) Heavy general purpose trucks (asset class 00.242), (ix) Rail-road cars and locomotives, except those owned by railroad transportation companies (asset class 00.25), (x) Tractor units for use over-the-road (asset class 00.26), (xi) Trailers and trailer-mounted containers (asset class 00.27), (xii) Vessels, barges, tugs, and similar water-transportation equipment, except those used in marine construction (asset class 00.28), and (xiii) Industrial steam and electric generation and/or distribution systems (asset class 00.4). 
717Property within a product class consists of de-preciable tangible personal property that is de-scribed in a 6-digit product class within Sectors 31, 32, and 33 (pertaining to manufacturing industries) of the North American Industry Classification Sys-tem (‘‘NAICS’’), set forth in Executive Office of the President, Office of Management and Budget, North American Industry Classification System , United States, 2002 (NAICS Manual), as periodically up-dated. Treas. Reg. sec. 1.1031(a)–2(b)(3). 
718Sec. 1031(b). For example, if a taxpayer holding land A having a basis of $40,000 and a fair market value of $100,000 exchanges the property for land B worth $90,000 plus $10,000 in cash, the taxpayer would recognize $10,000 of gain on the transaction, which would be includable in income. The remaining $50,000 of gain would be deferred until the taxpayer disposes of land B in a taxable sale or exchange. 
719Secs. 1245(b)(4) and 1250(d)(4). For example, if a taxpayer holding section 1245 property A with an original cost basis of $11,000, an adjusted basis of $10,000, and a fair market value of $15,000 exchanges the property for section 1245 property B with a fair market value of $14,000 plus $1,000 in cash, the tax-payer would recognize $1,000 of ordinary income on the transaction. The remaining $4,000 of gain would be deferred until the taxpayer disposes of section 1245 property B in a taxable sale or exchange. 
720Sec. 1031(c). 
721Sec. 1031(d). Thus, in the example noted above, the taxpayer’s basis in B would be $40,000 (the tax-payer’s transferred basis of $40,000, increased by $10,000 in gain recognized, and decreased by $10,000 in money received).

726It is intended that real property eligible for like-kind exchange treatment under present law will continue to be eligible for like-kind exchange treat-ment under the provision. For example, a like-kind exchange of real property includes an exchange of shares in a mutual ditch, reservoir, or irrigation company described in section 501(c)(12)(A) if at the time of the exchange such shares have been recog-nized by the highest court or statute of the State in which the company is organized as constituting or representing real property or an interest in real property. Similarly, improved real estate and unim-proved real estate are generally considered to be property of a like kind. See Treas. Reg. sec. 1.1031(a)–1(b).

712(2) in- tangible or nondepreciable personal prop-erty;
713and (3) real property.714However, the rules with respect to whether real estate is ‘‘like kind’’ are applied more liberally than the rules governing like-kind exchanges of depreciable, intangible, or nondepreciable personal property. For example, improved real estate and unimproved real estate gen-erally are considered to be property of a ‘‘like kind’’ as this distinction relates to the grade or quality of the real estate,
715while depreciable tangible personal properties must be either within the same General Asset Class
716or within the same Product Class.
717 The nonrecognition of gain in a like-kind exchange applies only to the extent that like-kind property is received in the ex-change. Thus, if an exchange of property would meet the requirements of section 1031, but for the fact that the property received in the transaction consists not only of the property that would be permitted to be ex-changed on a tax-free basis, but also other non-qualifying property or money (‘‘addi-tional consideration’’), then the gain to the recipient of the other property or money is required to be recognized, but not in an amount exceeding the fair market value of such other property or money.
718Addition-ally, any such gain realized on a section 1031 exchange as a result of additional consider-ation being involved constitutes ordinary in-come to the extent that the gain is subject to the recapture provisions of sections 1245 and 1250.719No losses may be recognized from a like-kind exchange.
720 If section 1031 applies to an exchange of properties, the basis of the property received in the exchange is equal to the basis of the property transferred. This basis is increased to the extent of any gain recognized as a re-sult of the receipt of other property or money in the like-kind exchange, and de-creased to the extent of any money received by the taxpayer.
721The holding period of qualifying property received includes the holding period of the qualifying property transferred, but the nonqualifying property received is required to begin a new holding period.
722 A like-kind exchange also does not require that the properties be exchanged simulta-neously. Rather, the property to be received in the exchange must be received not more than 180 days after the date on which the taxpayer relinquishes the original property (but in no event later than the due date (in-cluding extensions) of the taxpayer’s income tax return for the taxable year in which the transfer of the relinquished property occurs). In addition, the taxpayer must identify the property to be received within 45 days after the date on which the taxpayer transfers the property relinquished in the exchange.
723 The Treasury Department has issued regu-lations
724and revenue procedures725pro- viding guidance and safe harbors for tax-payers engaging in deferred like-kind ex-changes. 
HOUSE BILL  The provision modifies the provision pro-viding for nonrecognition of gain in the case of like-kind exchanges by limiting its appli-cation to real property that is not held pri-marily for sale.
726 Effective date.—The provision generally ap-plies to exchanges completed after December 31, 2017. However, an exception is provided for any exchange if the property disposed of by the taxpayer in the exchange is disposed of on or before December 31, 2017, or the property received by the taxpayer in the ex-change is received on or before such date. SENATE AMENDMENT  The Senate amendment follows the House bill. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the Sen-ate amendment. 4. Revision of treatment of contributions to capital (sec. 3304 of the House bill and sec. 118 of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  The gross income of a corporation does not include any contribution to its capital.
727 For purposes of this rule, a contribution to the capital of a corporation does not include any contribution in aid of construction or any other contribution from a customer or potential customer.
728A special rule allows certain contributions in aid of construction received by a regulated public utility that provides water or sewerage disposal services to be treated as a tax-free contribution to the capital of the utility.
729No deduction or credit is allowed for, or by reason of, any ex-penditure that constitutes a contribution that is treated as a tax-free contribution to the capital of the utility.
730 If property is acquired by a corporation as a contribution to capital and is not contrib-uted by a shareholder as such, the adjusted basis of the property is zero.
731If the con- tribution consists of money, the corporation must first reduce the basis of any property acquired with the contributed money within the following 12-month period, and then re-duce the basis of other property held by the corporation.
732Similarly, the adjusted basis of any property acquired by a utility with a contribution in aid of construction is zero.
733 
HOUSE BILL  The provision repeals the provision of the Internal Revenue Code under which, gen-erally, a corporation’s gross income does not include contributions of capital to the cor-poration. The provision provides that a contribution to capital, other than a contribution of money or property made in exchange for stock of a corporation or any interest in an entity, is included in gross income of the corporation. For example, a contribution of municipal land by a municipality that is not in exchange for stock (or for a partnership interest or other interest) of equivalent value is considered a contribution to capital that is includable in gross income. By con-trast, a municipal tax abatement for locat-ing a business in a particular municipality is not considered a contribution to capital. The provision further provides that a con-tribution of capital in exchange for stock is not includible in the gross income of the cor-poration to the extent that the fair market value of any money or other property con-tributed does not exceed the fair market value of stock received. It is intended that, for this purpose, the fair market value of any property contributed is calculated net of any liabilities to which the property is subject and net of any liabilities or obligations of the transferor assumed or taken subject to by the entity in connection with the trans-action. When valuing stock or equity re-ceived, taxpayers may disregard discounts

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH10050 December 15, 2017 
734Rev. Rul. 64–155, 1964–1 CB 138. 
735Sec. 162(a). 
736The term ‘‘influencing legislation’’ means any attempt to influence any legislation through com-munication with any member or employee of a legis-lative body, or with any government official or em-ployee who may participate in the formulation of legislation. The term ‘‘legislation’’ includes actions with respect to Acts, bills, resolutions, or similar items by the Congress, any State legislature, any local council, or similar governing body, or by the public in a referendum, initiative, constitutional amendment, or similar procedure. Secs. 162(e)(4) and 4911(e)(2). 737The term ‘‘covered executive branch official’’ means (1) the President, (2) the Vice President, (3) any officer or employee of the White House Office of the Executive Office of the President, and the two most senior level officers of each of the other agen-cies in such Executive Office, (4) any individual serv-icing in a position in level I of the Executive Sched-ule under section 5312 of title 5, United States Code, (5) any other individual designated by the President as having Cabinet-level status, and (6) any imme-diate deputy of an individual described in (4) or (5). Sec. 162(e)(6). 
738Sec. 162(e)(5)(C). 
739Sec. 162(e)(2)(A). 
740Sec. 162(e)(2)(B). 
741Sec. 162(e)(7). 
742Sec. 162(e)(5)(B). 743For this purpose, adjusted gross income is de-termined after application of sections 86, 135, 137, 219, 221, 222, and 469, without regard to the section 199 deduction. Sec. 199(d)(2). 
7447Sec. 199(a). In the case of oil related qualified production activities income, the deduction from taxable income is equal to six percent of the lesser of the taxpayer’s oil related qualified production ac-tivities income, qualified production activities in-come, or taxable income. Sec. 199(d)(9). 
745This example assumes the deduction does not exceed the wage limitation discussed below. 
746Sec. 199(c)(1). In computing qualified production activities income, the domestic production activi-ties deduction itself is not an allocable deduction. Sec. 199(c)(1)(B)(ii). See Treas. Reg. secs. 1.199–1 through 1.199–9 where the Secretary has prescribed rules for the proper allocation of items of income, deduction, expense, and loss for purposes of deter-mining qualified production activities income. 
747Qualifying production property generally in-cludes any tangible personal property, computer software, and sound recordings. Sec. 199(c)(5). 
748When used in the Code in a geographical sense, the term ‘‘United States’’ generally includes only the States and the District of Columbia. Sec. 7701(a)(9). A special rule for determining domestic production gross receipts, however, provides that for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2005, and before January 1, 2017, in the case of any taxpayer with gross receipts from sources within the Com-monwealth of Puerto Rico, the term ‘‘United States’’ includes the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, but only if all of the taxpayer’s Puerto Rico-sourced gross receipts are taxable under the Federal income tax for individuals or corporations for such taxable year. Secs. 199(d)(8)(A) and (C). In computing the 50- percent wage limitation, the taxpayer is permitted to take into account wages paid to bona fide resi-dents of Puerto Rico for services performed in Puer-to Rico. Sec. 199(d)(8)(B). 
749Qualified film includes any motion picture film or videotape (including live or delayed television programming, but not including certain sexually ex-plicit productions) if 50 percent or more of the total compensation relating to the production of the film (including compensation in the form of residuals and for lack of control and the effect of limited liquidity on valuation. The provision does not change the applica-tion of the meaningless gesture doctrine, de-scribed in Lessinger v. Commissioner, 872 F.2d 519 (2d. Cir. 1989) and related cases, as well as in administrative guidance.
734Thus, under the provision, whether incremental shares of stock are issued when the existing shareholder or shareholders of a corporation make a pro-rata contribution to the capital of the corporation is not determinative of whether the contribution is included in in-come of the corporation. The fair market value requirement gen-erally will be satisfied in any arm’s length transaction in which stock is issued in con-sideration for cash. Thus, for example, in a public offering, if the price of the stock was determined on an arm’s length basis, the fact the stock trades immediately after its issuance at a price below the issue price will not result in contribution to capital treat-ment. Finally, the provision provides rules clari-fying the contributee’s basis in the property contributed. Effective date.—The provision applies to contributions made, and transactions en-tered into, after the date of enactment. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  No provision. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the pol-icy of the House bill but takes a different ap-proach. The conference agreement does not repeal the provision of the Internal Revenue Code under which, generally, a corporation’s gross income does not include contributions to capital. Rather, it preserves that provi-sion, but provides that the term ‘‘contribu-tions to capital’’ does not include (1) any contribution in aid of construction or any other contribution as a customer or poten-tial customer, and (2) any contribution by any governmental entity or civic group (other than a contribution made by a share-holder as such). The conferees intend that section 118, as modified, continue to apply only to corporations. Effective date.—The provision applies to contributions made after the date of enact-ment. However, the provision shall not apply to any contribution made after the date of enactment by a governmental entity pursu-ant to a master development plan that has been approved prior to such date by a gov-ernmental entity. 5. Repeal of deduction for local lobbying ex-penses (sec. 3305 of the House bill, sec. 13308 of the Senate amendment, and sec. 162(e) of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  In general A taxpayer generally is allowed a deduc-tion for ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred in carrying on any trade or business.
735However, section 162(e) denies a deduction for amounts paid or incurred in connection with (1) influencing legislation,
736 (2) participation in, or intervention in, any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposi-tion to) any candidate for public office, (3) any attempt to influence the general public, or segments thereof, with respect to elec-tions, legislative matters, or referendums, or (4) any direct communication with a covered executive branch official737in an attempt to influence the official actions or positions of such official. Expenses paid or incurred in connection with lobbying and political ac-tivities (such as research for, or preparation, planning, or coordination of, any previously described activity) also are not deductible.
738 Exceptions Local legislation Notwithstanding the above, a deduction is allowed for ordinary and necessary expenses incurred in connection with any legislation of any local council or similar governing body (‘‘local legislation’’).
739With respect to local legislation, the exception permits a de-duction for amounts paid or incurred in car-rying on any trade or business (1) in direct connection with appearances before, submis-sion of statements to, or sending commu-nications to the committees or individual members of such council or body with re-spect to legislation or proposed legislation of direct interest to the taxpayer, or (2) in di-rect connection with communication of in-formation between the taxpayer and an orga-nization of which the taxpayer is a member with respect to any such legislation or pro-posed legislation which is of direct interest to the taxpayer and such organization, and (3) that portion of the dues paid or incurred with respect to any organization of which the taxpayer is a member which is attrib-utable to the expenses of the activities de-scribed in (1) or (2) carried on by such organi-zation.
740 For purposes of this exception, legislation of an Indian tribal government is treated in the same manner as local legislation.
741 De minimis For taxpayers with $2,000 or less of in- house expenditures related to lobbying and political activities, a de minimis exception is provided that permits a deduction.
742 
HOUSE BILL  The provision repeals the exception for amounts paid or incurred related to lobbying local councils or similar governing bodies, including Indian tribal governments. Thus, the general disallowance rules applicable to lobbying and political expenditures will apply to costs incurred related to such local legislation. Effective date.—The provision applies to amounts paid or incurred after December 31, 2017. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The Senate amendment follows the House bill other than to change the effective date so that the provision applies to amounts paid or incurred on or after the date of enact-ment. Effective date.—The provision applies to amounts paid or incurred on or after the date of enactment. CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the Sen-ate amendment. 6. Repeal of deduction for income attrib-utable to domestic production activities (sec. 3306 of the House bill, sec. 13305 of the Senate amendment, and sec. 199 of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  In general Section 199 provides a deduction from tax-able income (or, in the case of an individual, adjusted gross income
743) that is equal to nine percent of the lesser of the taxpayer’s qualified production activities income or taxable income (determined without regard to the section 199 deduction) for the taxable year.
744For corporations subject to the 35- percent corporate income tax rate, the nine- percent deduction effectively reduces the corporate income tax rate to slightly less than 32 percent on qualified production ac-tivities income.
745A similar reduction ap-plies to the graduated rates applicable to in-dividuals with qualifying domestic produc-tion activities income. In general, qualified production activities income is equal to domestic production gross receipts reduced by the sum of: (1) the costs of goods sold that are allocable to those re-ceipts; and (2) other expenses, losses, or de-ductions which are properly allocable to those receipts.
746 Domestic production gross receipts gen-erally are gross receipts of a taxpayer that are derived from: (1) any sale, exchange, or other disposition, or any lease, rental, or li-cense, of qualifying production property
747 that was manufactured, produced, grown or extracted by the taxpayer in whole or in sig-nificant part within the United States;
748(2) any sale, exchange, or other disposition, or any lease, rental, or license, of qualified film
749produced by the taxpayer; (3) any

750Sec. 199(c)(4)(A). 
751Sec. 199(b)(1). For purposes of the provision, ‘‘W– 2 wages’’ include the sum of the amounts of wages as defined in section 3401(a) and elective deferrals that the taxpayer properly reports to the Social Security Administration with respect to the employment of employees of the taxpayer during the calendar year ending during the taxpayer’s taxable year. Elective deferrals include elective deferrals as defined in sec-tion 402(g)(3), amounts deferred under section 457, and designated Roth contributions as defined in sec-tion 402A. See sec. 199(b)(2)(A). The wage limitation for qualified films includes any compensation for services performed in the United States by actors, production personnel, directors, and producers and is not restricted to W–2 wages. Sec. 199(b)(2)(D). 
752For this purpose, agricultural or horticultural products also include fertilizer, diesel fuel and other supplies used in agricultural or horticultural pro-duction that are manufactured, produced, grown, or extracted by the cooperative. 753Sec. 274(a)(1).

750 The amount of the deduction for a taxable year is limited to 50 percent of the W–2 wages paid by the taxpayer, and properly al-locable to domestic production gross re-ceipts, during the calendar year that ends in such taxable year.
751 Agricultural and horticultural cooperatives With regard to member-owned agricultural and horticultural cooperatives formed under Subchapter T of the Code, section 199 pro-vides the same treatment of qualified pro-duction activities income derived from agri-cultural or horticultural products that are manufactured, produced, grown, or extracted by cooperatives,
752or that are marketed through cooperatives, as it provides for qualified production activities income of other taxpayers (i.e., the cooperative may claim a deduction from qualified production activities income). In addition, section 199(d)(3)(A) provides that the amount of any patronage dividends or per-unit retain allocations paid to a mem-ber of an agricultural or horticultural coop-erative (to which Part I of Subchapter T ap-plies), which is allocable to the portion of qualified production activities income of the cooperative that is deductible under the pro-vision, is deductible from the gross income of the member. In order to qualify, such amount must be designated by the organiza-tion as allocable to the deductible portion of qualified production activities income in a written notice mailed to its patrons not later than the payment period described in section 1382(d). In addition, section 199(d)(3)(B) provides that the cooperative cannot reduce its income under section 1382 (e.g., cannot claim a dividends-paid deduc-tion) for such amounts. 
HOUSE BILL  The provision repeals the deduction for in-come attributable to domestic production activities. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The Senate amendment is the same as the House bill. Effective date.—The provision is effective for non-corporate taxpayers and for certain rules applicable to agricultural and horti-cultural cooperates provided in section 199(d)(3)(A) and (B) for taxable years begin-ning after December 31, 2017. The provision is effective for C corporations for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2018. CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the House bill. 7. Entertainment, etc. expenses (sec. 3307 of the House bill, sec. 13304 of the Senate amendment, and sec. 274 of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  In general No deduction is allowed with respect to (1) an activity generally considered to be enter-tainment, amusement, or recreation (‘‘enter-tainment’’), unless the taxpayer establishes that the item was directly related to (or, in certain cases, associated with) the active conduct of the taxpayer’s trade or business, or (2) a facility (e.g., an airplane) used in connection with such activity.
753If the tax- payer establishes that entertainment ex-penses are directly related to (or associated with) the active conduct of its trade or busi-ness, the deduction generally is limited to 50 percent of the amount otherwise deduct-ible.
754Similarly, a deduction for any ex-pense for food or beverages generally is lim-ited to 50 percent of the amount otherwise deductible.
755In addition, no deduction is al-lowed for membership dues with respect to any club organized for business, pleasure, recreation, or other social purpose.
756 There are a number of exceptions to the general rule disallowing deduction of enter-tainment expenses and the rules limiting de-ductions to 50 percent of the otherwise de-ductible amount. Under one such exception, those rules do not apply to expenses for goods, services, and facilities to the extent that the expenses are reported by the tax-payer as compensation and as wages to an employee.
757Those rules also do not apply to expenses for goods, services, and facilities to the extent that the expenses are includible in the gross income of a recipient who is not an employee (e.g., a nonemployee director) as compensation for services rendered or as a prize or award.
758The exceptions apply only to the extent that amounts are properly re-ported by the company as compensation and wages or otherwise includible in income. In no event can the amount of the deduction ex-ceed the amount of the taxpayer’s actual cost, even if a greater amount (i.e., fair mar-ket value) is includible in income.
759 Those deduction disallowance rules also do not apply to expenses paid or incurred by the taxpayer, in connection with the perform-ance of services for another person (other than an employer), under a reimbursement or other expense allowance arrangement if the taxpayer accounts for the expenses to such person.
760Another exception applies for expenses for recreational, social, or similar activities primarily for the benefit of em-ployees other than certain owners and highly compensated employees.
761An exception ap-plies also to the 50 percent deduction limit for food and beverages provided to crew members of certain commercial vessels and certain oil or gas platform or drilling rig workers.
762 Expenses treated as compensation Except as otherwise provided, gross income includes compensation for services, includ-ing fees, commissions, fringe benefits, and similar items.763In general, an employee (or other service provider) must include in gross income the amount by which the fair market value of a fringe benefit exceeds the sum of the amount (if any) paid by the individual and the amount (if any) specifically excluded from gross income.
764Treasury regulations provide detailed rules regarding the valu-ation of certain fringe benefits, including flights on an employer-provided aircraft. In general, the value of a non-commercial flight generally is determined under the base air-craft valuation formula, also known as the Standard Industry Fare Level formula or ‘‘SIFL.’’
765If the SIFL valuation rules do not apply, the value of a flight on an em-ployer-provided aircraft generally is equal to the amount that an individual would have to pay in an arm’s-length transaction to char-ter the same or a comparable aircraft for that period for the same or a comparable flight.
766 In the context of an employer providing an aircraft to employees for nonbusiness (e.g., vacation) flights, the exception for expenses treated as compensation has been inter-preted as not limiting the company’s deduc-tion for expenses attributable to the oper-ation of the aircraft to the amount of com-pensation reportable to its employees.
767The result of that interpretation is often a deduc-tion several times larger than the amount required to be included in income. Further, in many cases, the individual including amounts attributable to personal travel in income directly benefits from the enhanced deduction, resulting in a net deduction for the personal use of the company aircraft. The exceptions for expenses treated as compensation or otherwise includible income were subsequently modified in the case of specified individuals such that the excep-tions apply only to the extent of the amount of expenses treated as compensation or in-cludible in income of the specified indi-vidual.
768Specified individuals are individ-uals who, with respect to an employer or other service recipient (or a related party), are subject to the requirements of section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or would be subject to such requirements if the employer or service recipient (or related party) were an issuer of equity securities re-ferred to in section 16(a).
769 As a result, in the case of specified individ-uals, no deduction is allowed with respect to expenses for (1) a nonbusiness activity gen-erally considered to be entertainment, amusement or recreation, or (2) a facility (e.g., an airplane) used in connection with such activity to the extent that such ex-penses exceed the amount treated as com-pensation or includible in income to the specified individual. For example, a com-pany’s deduction attributable to aircraft op-erating costs and other expenses for a speci-fied individual’s vacation use of a company aircraft is limited to the amount reported as compensation to the specified individual. However, in the case of other employees or service providers, the company’s deduction is not limited to the amount treated as com-pensation or includible in income.

Excludable fringe benefits Certain employer-provided fringe benefits are excluded from an employee’s gross in-come and wages for employment tax pur-poses, including, but not limited to, de mini- mis fringes, qualified transportation fringes, on-premises athletic facilities, and meals provided for the ‘‘convenience of the em-ployer.’’
771 A de minimis fringe generally means any property or service the value of which is (taking into account the frequency with which similar fringes are provided by the employer) so small as to make accounting for it unreasonable or administratively im-practicable,
772and also includes food and beverages provided to employees through an eating facility operated by the employer that is located on or near the employer’s business premises and meets certain require-ments.
773 Qualified transportation fringes include qualified parking (parking on or near the employer’s business premises or on or near a location from which the employee commutes to work by public transit), transit passes, vanpool benefits, and qualified bicycle com-muting reimbursements.
774 On-premises athletic facilities are gyms or other athletic facilities located on the em-ployer’s premises, operated by the employer, and substantially all the use of which is by employees of the employer, their spouses, and their dependent children.
775 The value of meals furnished to an em-ployee or the employee’s spouse or depend-ents by or on behalf of an employer for the convenience of the employer is excludible from the employee’s gross income, but only if such meals are provided on the employer’s business premises.
776 
HOUSE BILL  The provision provides that no deduction is allowed with respect to (1) an activity gen-erally considered to be entertainment, amusement or recreation, (2) membership dues with respect to any club organized for business, pleasure, recreation or other social purposes, (3) a de minimis fringe that is pri-marily personal in nature and involving property or services that are not directly re-lated to the taxpayer’s trade or business, (4) a facility or portion thereof used in connec-tion with any of the above items, (5) a quali-fied transportation fringe, including costs of operating a facility used for qualified park-ing, and (6) an on-premises athletic facility provided by an employer to its employees, including costs of operating such a facility. Thus, the provision repeals the present-law exception to the deduction disallowance for entertainment, amusement, or recreation that is directly related to (or, in certain cases, associated with) the active conduct of the taxpayer’s trade or business (and the re-lated rule applying a 50 percent limit to such deductions). The provision also repeals the present-law exception for recreational, so-cial, or similar activities primarily for the benefit of employees. However, taxpayers may still, generally, deduct 50 percent of the food and beverage expenses associated with operating their trade or business ( e.g., meals consumed by employees on work travel). Under the provision, in the case of all indi-viduals (not just specified individuals), the exceptions to the general entertainment ex-pense disallowance rule for expenses treated as compensation or includible in income apply only to the extent of the amount of ex-penses treated as compensation or includible in income. Thus, under those exceptions, no deduction is allowed with respect to expenses for (1) a nonbusiness activity generally con-sidered to be entertainment, amusement or recreation, or (2) a facility (e.g., an airplane) used in connection with such activity to the extent that such expenses exceed the amount treated as compensation or includible in in-come. As under present law, the exceptions apply only if amounts are properly reported by the company as compensation and wages or otherwise includible in income. The provision amends the present-law ex-ception for reimbursed expenses. The provi-sion disallows a deduction for amounts paid or incurred by a taxpayer in connection with the performance of services for another per-son (other than an employer) under a reim-bursement or other expense allowance ar-rangement if the person for whom the serv-ices are performed is a tax-exempt entity777 or the arrangement is designated by the Sec-retary as having the effect of avoiding the 50 percent deduction disallowance. The provision clarifies that the exception to the 50 percent deduction limit for food or beverages applies to any expense excludible from the gross income of the recipient re-lated to meals furnished for the convenience of the employer. The provision thereby re-peals as deadwood the special exceptions for food or beverages provided to crew members of certain commercial vessels and certain oil or gas platform or drilling rig workers. Effective date.—The provision applies to amounts paid or incurred after December 31, 2017. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The provision provides that no deduction is allowed with respect to (1) an activity gen-erally considered to be entertainment, amusement or recreation, (2) membership dues with respect to any club organized for business, pleasure, recreation or other social purposes, or (3) a facility or portion thereof used in connection with any of the above items. Thus, the provision repeals the present-law exception to the deduction dis-allowance for entertainment, amusement, or recreation that is directly related to (or, in certain cases, associated with) the active conduct of the taxpayer’s trade or business (and the related rule applying a 50 percent limit to such deductions). In addition, the provision disallows a de-duction for expenses associated with pro-viding any qualified transportation fringe to employees of the taxpayer, and except as necessary for ensuring the safety of an em-ployee, any expense incurred for providing transportation (or any payment or reim-bursement) for commuting between the em-ployee’s residence and place of employment. Taxpayers may still generally deduct 50 percent of the food and beverage expenses as-sociated with operating their trade or busi-ness (e.g., meals consumed by employees on work travel). For amounts incurred and paid after December 31, 2017 and until December 31, 2025, the provision expands this 50 percent limitation to expenses of the employer asso-ciated with providing food and beverages to employees through an eating facility that meets requirements for de minimis fringes and for the convenience of the employer. Such amounts incurred and paid after De-cember 31, 2025 are not deductible. Effective date.—The provision generally ap-plies to amounts paid or incurred after De-cember 31, 2017. However, for expenses of the employer associated with providing food and beverages to employees through an eating fa-cility that meets requirements for de minimis fringes and for the convenience of the em-ployer, amounts paid or incurred after De-cember 31, 2025 are not deductible. CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the Sen-ate amendment. 18. Repeal of exclusion, etc., for employee achievement awards (sec. 1403 of the House bill, sec. 13310 of the Senate amendment, and secs. 74(c) and 274(j) of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  An employer’s deduction for the cost of an employee achievement award is limited to a certain amount.
778Employee achievement awards that are deductible by an employer (or would be deductible but for the fact that the employer is a tax-exempt organization) are excludible from an employee’s gross in-come.
779Amounts that are excludible from gross income under section 74(c) for income tax purposes are also excluded from wages for employment tax purposes. An employee achievement award is an item of tangible personal property given to an employee in recognition of either length of service or safety achievement and pre-sented as part of a meaningful presentation. 
HOUSE BILL  The provision repeals the deduction limita-tion for employee achievement awards. It also repeals the exclusions from gross in-come and wages. Effective date.—The provision is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The Senate amendment adds a definition of ‘‘tangible personal property’’ that may be considered a deductible employee achieve-ment award. It provides that tangible per-sonal property shall not include cash, cash equivalents, gift cards, gift coupons or gift certificates (other than arrangements con-ferring only the right to select and receive tangible personal property from a limited array of such items pre-selected or pre-ap-proved by the employer), or vacations, meals, lodging, tickets to theater or sporting events, stocks, bonds, other securities, and other similar items. No inference is intended that this is a change from present law and guidance. Effective date.—The provision applies to amounts paid or incurred after December 31, 2017. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the Sen-ate amendment.

Certain specialized entities that invest primarily in real es-tate related assets (real estate investment trusts) or in stock and securities (regulated investment com-panies) and that meet other requirements, generally including annual distribution of 90 percent of their income, are allowed to deduct their distributions to shareholders, thus generally paying little or no cor-porate-level tax despite otherwise being subject to subchapter C. 
788Sec. 162(a). However, certain exceptions apply. No deduction is allowed for (1) any charitable con-tribution or gift that would be allowable as a deduc-tion under section 170 were it not for the percentage limitations, the dollar limitations, or the require-ments as to the time of payment, set forth in such section; (2) any illegal bribe, illegal kickback, or other illegal payment; (3) certain lobbying and polit-ical expenditures; (4) any fine or similar penalty paid to a government for the violation of any law; (5) two-thirds of treble damage payments under the antitrust laws; (6) certain foreign advertising ex-penses; (7) certain amounts paid or incurred by a corporation in connection with the reacquisition of its stock or of the stock of any related person; or (8) certain applicable employee remuneration. 789Sec. 581.

795The Credit Union Membership Access Act, Pub. L. No. 105–219, allows multiple common bond credit unions. The legislation in part responds to National Credit Union Administration v. First National Bank & Trust Co., 522 U.S. 479 (1998), which interpreted the permissible membership of tax-exempt credit unions narrowly. 9. Unrelated business taxable income in-creased by amount of certain fringe ben-efit expenses for which deduction is dis-allowed (sec. 3308 of the House bill and sec. 512 of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  Tax exemption for certain organizations Section 501(a) exempts certain organiza-tions from Federal income tax. Such organi-zations include: (1) tax-exempt organizations described in section 501(c) (including among others section 501(c)(3) charitable organiza-tions and section 501(c)(4) social welfare or-ganizations); (2) religious and apostolic orga-nizations described in section 501(d); and (3) trusts forming part of a pension, profit-shar-ing, or stock bonus plan of an employer de-scribed in section 401(a). Unrelated business income tax, in general The unrelated business income tax (‘‘UBIT’’) generally applies to income de-rived from a trade or business regularly car-ried on by the organization that is not sub-stantially related to the performance of the organization’s tax-exempt functions.
780An organization that is subject to UBIT and that has $1,000 or more of gross unrelated business taxable income must report that in-come on Form 990–T (Exempt Organization Business Income Tax Return). Most exempt organizations may operate an unrelated trade or business so long as the or-ganization remains primarily engaged in ac-tivities that further its exempt purposes. Therefore, an organization may engage in a substantial amount of unrelated business ac-tivity without jeopardizing its exempt sta-tus. A section 501(c)(3) (charitable) organiza-tion, however, may not operate an unrelated trade or business as a substantial part of its activities.
781Therefore, the unrelated trade or business activity of a section 501(c)(3) or-ganization must be insubstantial. An organization determines its unrelated business taxable income by subtracting from its gross unrelated business income deduc-tions directly connected with the unrelated trade or business.
782Under regulations, in de-termining unrelated business taxable in-come, an organization that operates multiple unrelated trades or businesses aggregates in-come from all such activities and subtracts from the aggregate gross income the aggre-gate of deductions.
783As a result, an organi-zation may use a loss from one unrelated trade or business to offset gain from another, thereby reducing total unrelated business taxable income. Organizations subject to tax on unrelated business income Most exempt organizations are subject to the tax on unrelated business income. Spe-cifically, organizations subject to the unre-lated business income tax generally include: (1) organizations exempt from tax under sec-tion 501(a), including organizations described in section 501(c) (except for U.S. instrumen-talities and certain charitable trusts); (2) qualified pension, profit-sharing, and stock bonus plans described in section 401(a); and (3) certain State colleges and universities.
784 Exclusions from Unrelated Business Taxable Income Certain types of income are specifically ex-empt from unrelated business taxable in-come, such as dividends, interest, royalties, and certain rents,
785unless derived from debt-financed property or from certain 50- percent controlled subsidiaries.
786Other ex-emptions from UBIT are provided for activi-ties in which substantially all the work is performed by volunteers, for income from the sale of donated goods, and for certain ac-tivities carried on for the convenience of members, students, patients, officers, or em-ployees of a charitable organization. In addi-tion, special UBIT provisions exempt from tax activities of trade shows and State fairs, income from bingo games, and income from the distribution of low-cost items incidental to the solicitation of charitable contribu-tions. Organizations liable for tax on unre-lated business taxable income may be liable for alternative minimum tax determined after taking into account adjustments and tax preference items. HOUSE BILL  Under the provision, unrelated business taxable income includes any expenses paid or incurred by a tax exempt organization for qualified transportation fringe benefits (as defined in section 132(f)), a parking facility used in connection with qualified parking (as defined in section 132(f)(5)(C)), or any on- premises athletic facility (as defined in sec-tion 132(j)(4)(B)), provided such amounts are not deductible under section 274. Effective date.—The provision is effective for amounts paid or incurred after December 31, 2017. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  No provision. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the House bill. 10. Limitation on deduction for FDIC pre-miums (sec. 3309 of the House bill, sec. 13531 of the Senate amendment, and sec. 162 of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  Corporations organized under the laws of any of the 50 States (and the District of Co-lumbia) generally are subject to the U.S. cor-porate income tax on their worldwide tax-able income. The taxable income of a C cor-poration
787generally comprises gross income less allowable deductions. A taxpayer gen-erally is allowed a deduction for ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred in carrying on any trade or business.
788 Corporations that make a valid election pursuant to section 1362 of subchapter S of the Code, referred to as S corporations, gen-erally are not subject to corporate-level in-come tax on its items of income and loss. In-stead, an S corporation passes through to shareholders its items of income and loss. The shareholders separately take into ac-count their shares of these items on their in-dividual income tax returns. Banks, thrifts, and credit unions In general Financial institutions are subject to the same Federal income tax rules and rates as are applied to other corporations or entities, with specified exceptions. C corporation banks and thrifts A bank is generally taxed for Federal in-come tax purposes as a C corporation. For this purpose a bank generally means a cor-poration, a substantial portion of whose business is receiving deposits and making loans and discounts, or exercising certain fi-duciary powers.789A bank for this purpose generally includes domestic building and loan associations, mutual stock or savings banks, and certain cooperative banks that are commonly referred to as thrifts.
790 S corporation banks A bank is generally eligible to elect S cor-poration status under section 1362, provided it meets the other requirements for making this election and it does not use the reserve method of accounting for bad debts as de-scribed in section 585.
791 Special bad debt loss rules for small banks Section 166 provides a deduction for any debt that becomes worthless (wholly or par-tially) within a taxable year. The reserve method of accounting for bad debts, repealed in 1986
792for most taxpayers, is allowed under section 585 for any bank (as defined in section 581) other than a large bank. For this purpose, a bank is a large bank if, for the taxable year (or for any preceding taxable year after 1986), the average adjusted basis of all its assets (or the assets of the controlled group of which it is a member) exceeds $500 million. Deductions for reserves are taken in lieu of a worthless debt deduction under sec-tion 166. Accordingly, a small bank is able to take deductions for additions to a bad debt reserve. Additions to the reserve are deter-mined under an experience method that gen-erally looks to the ratio of (1) the total bad debts sustained during the taxable year and the five preceding taxable years to (2) the sum of the loans outstanding at the close of such taxable years.
793 Credit unions Credit unions are exempt from Federal in-come taxation.
794The exemption is based on their status as not-for-profit mutual or coop-erative organizations (without capital stock) operated for the benefit of their members, who generally must share a common bond. The definition of common bond has been ex-panded to permit greater use of credit unions.
795While significant differences be-tween the rules under which credit unions and banks operate have existed in the past,

804The net gain from the sale, exchange, or invol-untary conversion of certain property used in the taxpayer’s trade or business (in excess of deprecia-tion recapture) is treated as long-term capital gain.

796 FDIC premiums The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (‘‘FDIC’’) provides deposit insurance for banks and savings institutions. To maintain its status as an insured depository institu-tion, a bank must pay semiannual assess-ments into the deposit insurance fund (‘‘DIF’’). Assessments for deposit insurance are treated as ordinary and necessary busi-ness expenses. These assessments, also known as premiums, are deductible once the all events test for the premium is satis-fied.
797 
HOUSE BILL  No deduction is allowed for the applicable percentage of any FDIC premium paid or in-curred by the taxpayer. For taxpayers with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, the applicable percentage is 100 per-cent. Otherwise, the applicable percentage is the ratio of the excess of total consolidated assets over $10 billion to $40 billion. For ex-ample, for a taxpayer with total consolidated assets of $20 billion, no deduction is allowed for 25 percent of FDIC premiums. The provi-sion does not apply to taxpayers with total consolidated assets (as of the close of the taxable year) that do not exceed $10 billion. FDIC premium means any assessment im-posed under section 7(b) of the Federal De-posit Insurance Act.
798The term total con-solidated assets has the meaning given such term under section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protec-tion Act.
799 For purposes of determining a taxpayer’s total consolidated assets, members of an ex-panded affiliated group are treated as a sin-gle taxpayer. An expanded affiliated group means an affiliated group as defined in sec-tion 1504(a), determined by substituting ‘‘more than 50 percent’’ for ‘‘at least 80 per-cent’’ each place it appears and without re-gard to the exceptions from the definition of includible corporation for insurance compa-nies and foreign corporations. A partnership or any other entity other than a corporation is treated as a member of an expanded affili-ated group if such entity is controlled by members of such group. Effective date.—The provision applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The Senate amendment follows the House bill. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the Sen-ate amendment. 11. Repeal of rollover of publicly traded secu-rities gain into specialized small business investment companies (sec. 3310 of the House bill and sec. 1044 of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  A corporation or individual may elect to roll over tax-free any capital gain realized on the sale of publicly-traded securities to the extent of the taxpayer’s cost of pur-chasing common stock or a partnership in-terest in a specialized small business invest-ment company within 60 days of the sale.
800 The amount of gain that an individual may elect to roll over under this provision for a taxable year is limited to (1) $50,000 or (2) $500,000 reduced by the gain previously ex-cluded under this provision.801For corpora-tions, these limits are $250,000 and $1 million, respectively.
802 
HOUSE BILL  The House bill repeals the election de-scribed above to roll over tax-free capital gain realized on the sale of publicly-traded securities. Effective date.—The provision applies to sales after December 31, 2017. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  No provision. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the House bill. 12. Certain self-created property not treated as a capital asset (sec. 3311 of the House bill and sec. 1221 of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  In general, property held by a taxpayer (whether or not connected with his trade or business) is considered a capital asset.
803Cer- tain assets, however, are specifically ex-cluded from the definition of capital asset. Such excluded assets are: inventory prop-erty, property of a character subject to de-preciation (including real property),
804cer- tain self-created intangibles, accounts or notes receivable acquired in the ordinary course of business (e.g., for providing services or selling property), publications of the U.S. Government received by a taxpayer other than by purchase at the price offered to the public, commodities derivative financial in-struments held by a commodities derivatives dealer unless established to the satisfaction of the Secretary that any such instrument has no connection to the activities of such dealer as a dealer and clearly identified as such before the close of the day on which it was acquired, originated, or entered into, hedging transactions clearly identified as such, and supplies regularly used or con-sumed by the taxpayer in the ordinary course of a trade or business of the tax-payer.
805 Self-created intangibles subject to the ex-ception are copyrights, literary, musical, or artistic compositions, letters or memoranda, or similar property which is held either by the taxpayer who created the property, or (in the case of a letter, memorandum, or similar property) a taxpayer for whom the property was produced.
806For the purpose of deter-mining gain, a taxpayer with a substituted or transferred basis from the taxpayer who created the property, or for whom the prop-erty was created, also is subject to the ex-ception.
807However, a taxpayer may elect to treat musical compositions and copyrights in musical works as capital assets.
808 Since the intent of Congress is that profits and losses arising from everyday business op-erations be characterized as ordinary income and loss, the general definition of capital asset is narrowly applied and the categories of exclusions are broadly interpreted.809 
HOUSE BILL  This provision amends section 1221(a)(3), resulting in the exclusion of a patent, inven-tion, model or design (whether or not pat-ented), and a secret formula or process which is held either by the taxpayer who created the property or a taxpayer with a sub-stituted or transferred basis from the tax-payer who created the property (or for whom the property was created) from the definition of a ‘‘capital asset.’’ Thus, gains or losses from the sale or exchange of a patent, inven-tion, model or design (whether or not pat-ented), or a secret formula or process which is held either by the taxpayer who created the property or a taxpayer with a sub-stituted or transferred basis from the tax-payer who created the property (or for whom the property was created) will not receive capital gain treatment. Effective date.—The provision applies to dispositions after December 31, 2017. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  No provision. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the House bill. 13. Repeal of special rule for sale or exchange of patents (sec. 3312 of the House bill and sec. 1235 of the Code)) 
PRESENT LAW  Section 1235 provides that a transfer
810of all substantial rights to a patent, or an undi-vided interest therein which includes a part of all such rights, by any holder shall be con-sidered the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than one year, regardless of whether or not payments in consideration of such transfer are (1) payable periodically over a period generally conterminous with the transferee’s use of the patent, or (2) con-tingent on the productivity, use, or disposi-tion of the property transferred.
811 A holder is defined as (1) any individual whose efforts created such property, or (2) any other individual who has acquired his in-terest in such property in exchange for con-sideration in money or money’s worth paid to such creator prior to actual reduction to practice of the invention covered by the pat-ent, if such individual is neither the em-ployer of such creator nor related (as de-fined) to such creator.
812 
HOUSE BILL  The provision repeals section 1235. Thus, the holder of a patented invention may not transfer his or her rights to the patent and treat amounts received as proceeds from the sale of a capital asset. It is intended that the determination of whether a transfer is a sale or exchange of a capital asset that produces capital gain, or a transaction that produces ordinary income, will be determined under generally applicable principles.
813 Effective date.—The provision applies to dispositions after December 31, 2017. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  No provision. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement does not follow the House bill provision.

Commissioner, 56 T.C. 530 (1971), aff’d 492 F.2d 286 (7th Cir. 1974)), a more recent case concluded that partnership profits interests were not includ-able on receipt, because the profits interests were speculative and without fair market value ( Campbell v.

826Rev. Proc. 93–27, 1993–2 C.B. 343. 
827The Department of Treasury has issued pro-posed regulations regarding the application of sec-tion 83 to the compensatory transfer of a partner-ship interest. 70 Fed. Reg. 29675 (May 24, 2005). The proposed regulations provide that a partnership in-terest is ‘‘property’’ for purposes of section 83. Thus, a compensatory transfer of a partnership interest is includible in the service provider’s gross income at the time that it first becomes substantially vested (or, in the case of a substantially nonvested partner-ship interest, at the time of grant if a section 83(b) election is made). However, because the fair market value of a compensatory partnership interest is often difficult to determine, the proposed regula-tions also permit a partnership and a partner to elect a safe harbor under which the fair market value of a compensatory partnership interest is treated as being equal to the liquidation value of that interest. Therefore, in the case of a true profits interest in a partnership (one under which the part-ner would be entitled to nothing if the partnership were liquidated immediately following the grant), under the proposed regulations, the grant of a sub-stantially vested profits interest (or, if a section 83(b) election is made, the grant of a substantially nonvested profits interest) results in no income in-clusion under section 83 because the fair market value of the property received by the service pro-vider is zero. The proposed safe harbor is subject to a number of conditions. For example, the election cannot be made retroactively and must apply to all compensatory partnership transfers that occur dur-ing the period that the election is in effect.

829Sec. 702. 14. Repeal of technical termination of part-nerships (sec. 3313 of the House bill and sec. 708(b) of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  A partnership is considered as terminated under specified circumstances.
814Special rules apply in the case of the merger, con-solidation, or division of a partnership.
815 A partnership is treated as terminated if no part of any business, financial operation, or venture of the partnership continues to be carried on by any of its partners in a part-nership.
816 A partnership is also treated as terminated if within any 12-month period, there is a sale or exchange of 50 percent or more of the total interest in partnership capital and profits.
817This is sometimes referred to as a technical termination. Under regulations, the technical termination gives rise to a deemed contribution of all the partnership’s assets and liabilities to a new partnership in exchange for an interest in the new partner-ship, followed by a deemed distribution of in-terests in the new partnership to the pur-chasing partners and the other remaining partners.
818 The effect of a technical termination is not necessarily the end of the partnership’s ex-istence, but rather the termination of some tax attributes. Upon a technical termi-nation, the partnership’s taxable year closes, potentially resulting in short taxable years.
819Partnership-level elections gen-erally cease to apply following a technical termination.
820A technical termination gen-erally results in the restart of partnership depreciation recovery periods. 
HOUSE BILL  The provision repeals the section 708(b)(1)(B) rule providing for technical ter-minations of partnerships. The provision does not change the present-law rule of sec-tion 708(b)(1)(A) that a partnership is consid-ered as terminated if no part of any business, financial operation, or venture of the part-nership continues to be carried on by any of its partners in a partnership. Effective date.—The provision applies to partnership taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  No provision. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the House bill. 15. Recharacterization of certain gains in the case of partnership profits interests held in connection with performance of invest-ment services (sec. 3314 of the House bill, sec. 13310 of the Senate amendment, and secs. 1061 and 83 of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  Partnership profits interest for services A profits interest in a partnership is the right to receive future profits in the partner-ship but does not generally include any right to receive money or other property upon the immediate liquidation of the partnership. The treatment of the receipt of a profits in-terest in a partnership (sometimes referred to as a carried interest) in exchange for the performance of services has been the subject of controversy. Though courts have differed, in some instances, a taxpayer receiving a profits interest for performing services has not been taxed upon the receipt of the part-nership interest.821 In 1993, the Internal Revenue Service, re-ferring to the litigation of the tax treatment of receiving a partnership profits interest and the results in the cases, issued adminis-trative guidance that the IRS generally would treat the receipt of a partnership prof-its interest for services as not a taxable event for the partnership or the partner.
822 Under this guidance, this treatment does not apply, however, if: (1) the profits interest re-lates to a substantially certain and predict-able stream of income from partnership as-sets, such as income from high-quality debt securities or a high-quality net lease; (2) within two years of receipt, the partner dis-poses of the profits interest; or (3) the profits interest is a limited partnership interest in a publicly traded partnership. More recent ad-ministrative guidance
823clarifies that this treatment applies with respect to substan-tially unvested profits interests provided the service partner takes into income his dis-tributive share of partnership income, and the partnership does not deduct any amount either on grant or on vesting of the profits interest.
824 By contrast, a partnership capital interest received for services is includable in the partner’s income under generally applicable rules relating to the receipt of property for the performance of services.
825A partnership capital interest for this purpose is an inter-est that would entitle the receiving partner to a share of the proceeds if the partnership’s assets were sold at fair market value and the proceeds were distributed in liquidation.
826 Property received for services under section 83 In general Section 83 governs the amount and timing of income and deductions attributable to transfers of property in connection with the performance of services. If property is trans-ferred in connection with the performance of services, the person performing the services (the ‘‘service provider’’) generally must rec-ognize income for the taxable year in which the property is first substantially vested (i.e., transferable or not subject to a substan-tial risk of forfeiture).
827The amount includ-ible in the service provider’s income is the excess of the fair market value of the prop-erty over the amount (if any) paid for the property. A deduction is allowed to the per-son for whom such services are performed (the ‘‘service recipient’’) equal to the amount included in gross income by the service provider.828The deduction is allowed for the taxable year of the service recipient in which or with which ends the taxable year in which the amount is included in the serv-ice provider’s income. Property that is subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture and that is not transferable is generally referred to as ‘‘substantially nonvested.’’ Property is subject to a substan-tial risk of forfeiture if the individual’s right to the property is conditioned on the future performance (or refraining from perform-ance) of substantial services. In addition, a substantial risk of forfeiture exists if the right to the property is subject to a condi-tion other than the performance of services, provided that the condition relates to a pur-pose of the transfer and there is a substan-tial possibility that the property will be for-feited if the condition does not occur. Section 83(b) election Under section 83(b), even if the property is substantially nonvested at the time of trans-fer, the service provider may nevertheless elect within 30 days of the transfer to recog-nize income for the taxable year of the trans-fer. Such an election is referred to as a ‘‘sec-tion 83(b) election.’’ The service provider makes an election by filing with the IRS a written statement that includes the fair market value of the property at the time of transfer and the amount (if any) paid for the property. The service provider must also pro-vide a copy of the statement to the service recipient. Passthrough tax treatment of partnerships The character of partnership items passes through to the partners, as if the items were realized directly by the partners.
829Thus, for example, long-term capital gain of the part-nership is treated as long-term capital gain in the hands of the partners. A partner holding a partnership interest includes in income its distributive share (whether or not actually distributed) of part-nership items of income and gain, including capital gain eligible for the lower tax rates. A partner’s basis in the partnership interest is increased by any amount of gain thus in-cluded and is decreased by losses. These basis adjustments prevent double taxation of part-nership income to the partner, preserving the partnership’s tax status as a passthrough

830Sec. 1. Other rates apply to certain types of gain. The unrecaptured section 1250 gain is taxed at a maximum rate of 25 percent, and 28-percent rate gain is taxed at a maximum rate of 28 percent. Any amount of unrecaptured section 1250 gain or 28-per-cent rate gain otherwise taxed at a 10- or 15-percent rate is taxed at the otherwise applicable rate. In ad-dition, a tax is imposed on net investment income in the case of an individual, estate, or trust. In the case of an individual, the tax is 3.8 percent of the lesser of net investment income, which includes gains and dividends, or the excess of modified ad-justed gross income over the threshold amount. The threshold amount is $250,000 in the case of a joint re-turn or surviving spouse, $125,000 in the case of a married individual filing a separate return, and $200,000 in the case of any other individual. 
831Sec. 1221. A capital asset generally means any property except (1) inventory, stock in trade, or property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of the taxpayer’s trade or business, (2) depreciable or real property used in the tax-payer’s trade or business, (3) specified literary or ar-tistic property, (4) business accounts or notes re-ceivable, (5) certain U.S. publications, (6) certain commodity derivative financial instruments, (7) hedging transactions, and (8) business supplies. In addition, the net gain from the disposition of cer-tain property used in the taxpayer’s trade or busi-ness is treated as long-term capital gain. Gain from the disposition of depreciable personal property is not treated as capital gain to the extent of all pre-vious depreciation allowances. Gain from the dis-position of depreciable real property is generally not treated as capital gain to the extent of the deprecia-tion allowances in excess of the allowances available under the straight-line method of depreciation. 
832Sec. 163(d). 833Sec. 318(a)(1). entity. Money distributed to the partner by the partnership is taxed to the extent the amount exceeds the partner’s basis in the partnership interest. Net long-term capital gain In the case of an individual, estate, or trust, any adjusted net capital gain which otherwise would be taxed at the 10- or 15-per-cent rate is not taxed. Any adjusted net cap-ital gain which otherwise would be taxed at rates over 15 percent and below 39.6 percent is taxed at a 15-percent rate. Any adjusted net capital gain which otherwise would be taxed at a 39.6-percent rate is taxed at a 20- percent rate.
830 In general, gain or loss reflected in the value of an asset is not recognized for in-come tax purposes until a taxpayer disposes of the asset. On the sale or exchange of a capital asset,
831any gain generally is in-cluded in income. Short-term capital gain means gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for not more than one year, if and to the ex-tent such gain is taken into account in com-puting gross income. Net short-term capital loss means the excess of short term capital losses for the taxable year over the short- term capital gains for the taxable year. Net long-term capital gain means the ex-cess of long-term capital gains for the tax-able year over the long-term capital losses for the taxable year. Net capital gain is the excess of the net long-term capital gain for the taxable year over the net short-term capital loss for the year. Gain or loss is treated as long-term if the asset is held for more than one year. The adjusted net capital gain of an indi-vidual is the net capital gain reduced (but not below zero) by the sum of the 28-percent rate gain and the unrecaptured section 1250 gain. The net capital gain is reduced by the amount of gain that the individual treats as investment income for purposes of deter-mining the investment interest limitation.
832 
HOUSE BILL  General rule The provision provides for a three-year holding period in the case of certain net long-term capital gain with respect to any applicable partnership interest held by the taxpayer. Section 83 (relating to property transferred in connection with performance of services) does not apply to the transfer of a partner-ship interest to which the provision applies. Short-term capital gain The provision treats as short-term capital gain taxed at ordinary income rates the amount of the taxpayer’s net long-term cap-ital gain with respect to an applicable part-nership interest for the taxable year that ex-ceeds the amount of such gain calculated as if a three-year (not one-year) holding period applies. In making this calculation, the pro-vision takes account of long-term capital losses calculated as if a three-year holding period applies. A special rule provides that, as provided in regulations or other guidance issued by the Secretary, this rule does not apply to income or gain attributable to any asset that is not held for portfolio investment on behalf of third party investors. Third party investor means a person (1) who holds an interest in the partnership that is not property held in connection with an applicable trade or busi-ness (defined below) with respect to that per-son, and (2) who is not and has not been ac-tively engaged in directly or indirectly pro-viding substantial services for the partner-ship or any applicable trade or business (and is (or was) not related to a person so en-gaged). A related person for this purpose is a family member (within the meaning of attri-bution rules833) or colleague, that is a person who performed a service within the current calendar year or the preceding three cal-endar years in any applicable trade or busi-ness in which or for which the taxpayer per-formed a service. Applicable partnership interest An applicable partnership interest is any interest in a partnership that, directly or in-directly, is transferred to (or held by) the taxpayer in connection with performance of services in any applicable trade or business. The services may be performed by the tax-payer or by any other related person or per-sons in any applicable trade or business. It is intended that partnership interests shall not fail to be treated as transferred or held in connection with the performance of services merely because the taxpayer also made con-tributions to the partnership, and the Treas-ury Department is directed to provide guid-ance implementing this intent. An applica-ble partnership interest does not include an interest held by a person who is employed by another entity that is conducting a trade or business (which is not an applicable trade or business) and who provides services only to the other entity. An applicable partnership interest does not include an interest in a partnership directly or indirectly held by a corporation. For ex-ample, if two corporations form a partner-ship to conduct a joint venture for devel-oping and marketing a pharmaceutical prod-uct, the partnership interests held by the two corporations are not applicable partner-ship interests. An applicable partnership interest does not include any capital interest in a partnership giving the taxpayer a right to share in part-nership capital commensurate with the amount of capital contributed (as of the time the partnership interest was received), or commensurate with the value of the partner-ship interest that is taxed under section 83 on receipt or vesting of the partnership in-terest. For example, in the case of a partner who holds a capital interest in the partner-ship with respect to capital he or she con-tributed to the partnership, if the partner-ship agreement provides that the partner’s share of partnership capital is commensurate with the amount of capital he or she contrib-uted (as of the time the partnership interest was received) compared to total partnership capital, the partnership interest is not an ap-plicable partnership interest to that extent. Applicable trade or business An applicable trade or business means any activity (regardless of whether the activity are conducted in one or more entities) that consists in whole or in part of the following: (1) raising or returning capital, and either (2) investing in (or disposing of) specified assets (or identifying specified assets for investing or disposition), or (3) developing specified as-sets. Developing specified assets takes place, for example, if it is represented to investors, lenders, regulators, or others that the value, price, or yield of a portfolio business may be enhanced or increased in connection with choices or actions of a service provider or of others acting in concert with or at the direc-tion of a service provider. Services per-formed as an employee of an applicable trade or business are treated as performed in an applicable trade or business for purposes of this rule. Merely voting shares owned does not amount to development; for example, a mutual fund that merely votes proxies re-ceived with respect to shares of stock it holds is not engaged in development. Specified assets Under the provision, specified assets means securities (generally as defined under rules for mark-to-market accounting for securi-ties dealers), commodities (as defined under rules for mark-to-market accounting for commodities dealers), real estate held for rental or investment, cash or cash equiva-lents, options or derivative contracts with respect to such securities, commodities, real estate, cash or cash equivalents, as well as an interest in a partnership to the extent of the partnership’s proportionate interest in the foregoing. A security for this purpose means any (1) share of corporate stock, (2) partnership interest or beneficial ownership interest in a widely held or publicly traded partnership or trust, (3) note, bond, deben-ture, or other evidence of indebtedness, (4) interest rate, currency, or equity notional principal contract, (5) interest in, or deriva-tive financial instrument in, any such secu-rity or any currency (regardless of whether section 1256 applies to the contract), and (6) position that is not such a security and is a hedge with respect to such a security and is clearly identified. A commodity for this pur-pose means any (1) commodity that is ac-tively traded, (2) notional principal contract with respect to such a commodity, (3) inter-est in, or derivative financial instrument in, such a commodity or notional principal con-tract, or (4) position that is not such a com-modity and is a hedge with respect to such a commodity and is clearly identified. For pur-poses of the provision, real estate held for rental or investment does not include, for ex-ample, real estate on which the holder oper-ates an active farm. A partnership interest, for purposes of de-termining the proportionate interest of a partnership in any specified asset, includes any partnership interest that is not other-wise treated as a security for purposes of the provision (for example, an interest in a part-nership that is not widely held or publicly traded). For example, assume that a hedge fund acquires an interest in an operating business conducted in the form of a non-pub-licly traded partnership that is not widely held; the partnership interest is a specified asset for purposes of the provision.

837Sec. 174(b). Taxpayers generating significant short-term losses often choose to defer the deduc-tion for their research and experimentation expendi-tures under this section. Additionally, section 174 amounts are excluded from the definition of ‘‘start- up expenditures’’ under section 195 (section 195 gen-erally provides that start-up expenditures in excess of $5,000 either are not deductible or are amortizable over a period of not less than 180 months once an ac-tive trade or business begins). So as not to generate significant losses before beginning their trade or business, a taxpayer may choose to defer the deduc-tion and amortize its section 174 costs beginning with the month in which the taxpayer first realizes benefits from the expenditures. 
838Secs. 174(f)(2) and 59(e). This special 10-year election is available to mitigate the effect of the al-ternative minimum tax adjustment for research ex-penditures set forth in section 56(b)(2).

The amount included as short-term capital gain on the transfer is reduced by the amount treated as short-term capital gain on the transfer for the taxable year under the general rule of the provision (that is, amounts are not double-counted). A related person for this purpose is a family member (within the meaning of attribution rules
834) or colleague, that is a person who performed a service within the current calendar year or the preceding three calendar years in any ap-plicable trade or business in which or for which the taxpayer performed a service. Reporting requirement The Secretary is directed to require report-ing (at the time in the manner determined by the Secretary) necessary to carry out the purposes of the provision. The penalties oth-erwise applicable to a failure to report to partners under section 6031(b) apply to fail-ure to report under this requirement. Regulatory authority The Treasury Department is directed to issue regulations or other guidance nec-essary to carry out the provision. Such guid-ance is to address prevention of the abuse of the purposes of the provision, including through the allocation of income to tax-in-different parties. Guidance is also to provide for the application of the provision in the case of tiered structures of entities. Effective date.—The provision applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The Senate amendment is generally the same as the House bill, except with respect to the nonapplicability of section 83. Under the Senate amendment, the provision pro-vides a three-year holding period in the case of certain net long-term capital gain with re-spect to any applicable partnership interest held by the taxpayer, notwithstanding the rules of section 83 or any election in effect under section 83(b). 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the Sen-ate amendment. The conferees wish to clar-ify the interaction of section 83 with the pro-vision’s three-year holding requirement, which applies notwithstanding the rules of section 83 or any election in effect under sec-tion 83(b). Under the provision, the fact that an individual may have included an amount in income upon acquisition of the applicable partnership interest, or that an individual may have made a section 83(b) election with respect to an applicable partnership interest, does not change the three-year holding pe-riod requirement for long-term capital gain treatment with respect to the applicable partnership interest. Thus, the provision treats as short-term capital gain taxed at or-dinary income rates the amount of the tax-payer’s net long-term capital gain with re-spect to an applicable partnership interest for the taxable year that exceeds the amount of such gain calculated as if a three-year (not one-year) holding period applies. In making this calculation, the provision takes account of long-term capital losses cal-culated as if a three-year holding period ap-plies. 16. Amortization of research and experi-mental expenditures (sec. 3315 of the House bill, sec. 13206 of the Senate amendment, and sec. 174 of the Code) PRESENT LAW  Business expenses associated with the de-velopment or creation of an asset having a useful life extending beyond the current year generally must be capitalized and depre-ciated over such useful life.
835Taxpayers, however, may elect to deduct currently the amount of certain reasonable research or ex-perimentation expenditures paid or incurred in connection with a trade or business.
836 Taxpayers may choose to forgo a current de-duction, capitalize their research expendi-tures, and recover them ratably over the use-ful life of the research, but in no case over a period of less than 60 months.
837Taxpayers, alternatively, may elect to amortize their research expenditures over a period of 10 years.
838Research and experimental expendi-tures deductible under section 174 are not subject to capitalization under either section 263(a)
839or section 263A.840 Amounts defined as research or experi-mental expenditures under section 174 gen-erally include all costs incurred in the exper-imental or laboratory sense related to the development or improvement of a product.
841 In particular, qualifying costs are those in-curred for activities intended to discover in-formation that would eliminate uncertainty concerning the development or improvement of a product.
842Uncertainty exists when in-formation available to the taxpayer is not sufficient to ascertain the capability or method for developing, improving, and/or ap-propriately designing the product.
843The de- termination of whether expenditures qualify as deductible research expenses depends on the nature of the activity to which the costs relate, not the nature of the product or im-provement being developed or the level of technological advancement the product or improvement represents. Examples of quali-fying costs include salaries for those engaged in research or experimentation efforts, amounts incurred to operate and maintain research facilities (e.g., utilities, deprecia-tion, rent), and expenditures for materials and supplies used and consumed in the course of research or experimentation (in-cluding amounts incurred in conducting trials).844In addition, under administrative guidance, the costs of developing computer software have been accorded treatment simi-lar to research expenditures.
845 Research or experimental expenditures under section 174 do not include expenditures for quality control testing; efficiency sur-veys; management studies; consumer sur-veys; advertising or promotions; the acquisi-tion of another’s patent, model, production or process; or research in connection with literary, historical, or similar projects.
846 For purposes of section 174, quality control testing means testing to determine whether particular units of materials or products conform to specified parameters, but does not include testing to determine if the de-sign of the product is appropriate.
847 Generally, no current deduction under sec-tion 174 is allowable for expenditures for the acquisition or improvement of land or of de-preciable or depletable property used in con-nection with any research or experimen-tation.
848In addition, no current deduction is allowed for research expenses incurred for the purpose of ascertaining the existence, lo-cation, extent, or quality of any deposit of ore or other mineral, including oil and gas.
849 
HOUSE BILL  Under the provision, amounts defined as specified research or experimental expendi-tures are required to be capitalized and am-ortized ratably over a five-year period, be-ginning with the midpoint of the taxable year in which the specified research or exper-imental expenditures were paid or incurred. Specified research or experimental expendi-tures which are attributable to research that is conducted outside of the United States
850 are required to be capitalized and amortized ratably over a period of 15 years, beginning with the midpoint of the taxable year in which such expenditures were paid or in-curred. Specified research or experimental expenditures subject to capitalization in-clude expenditures for software development. Specified research or experimental expend-itures do not include expenditures for land or for depreciable or depletable property used in connection with the research or experi-mentation, but do include the depreciation and depletion allowances of such property. Also excluded are exploration expenditures incurred for ore or other minerals (including oil and gas). In the case of retired, abandoned, or dis-posed property with respect to which speci-fied research or experimental expenditures are paid or incurred, any remaining basis may not be recovered in the year of retire-ment, abandonment, or disposal, but instead must continue to be amortized over the re-maining amortization period. As part of the repeal of the alternative minimum tax, taxpayers may no longer elect

872The provision does not revise the rules associ-ated with when an item is realized for Federal in-come tax purposes and, accordingly, does not re-quire the recognition of income in situations where the Federal income tax realization event has not yet occurred. For example, the provision does not re-quire the recharacterization of a transaction from sale to lease, or vice versa, to conform to how the transaction is reported in the taxpayer’s applicable financial statement. Similarly, the provision does not require the recognition of gain or loss from se-curities that are marked to market for financial re-porting purposes if the gain or loss from such invest-ments is not realized for Federal income tax pur-poses until such time that the taxpayer sells or oth-erwise disposes of the investment. As a further ex-ample, income from investments in corporations or partnerships that are accounted for under the equity method for financial reporting purposes will not re-sult in the recognition of income for Federal income tax purposes until such time that the Federal in-come tax realization even has occurred ( e.g., when the taxpayer receives a dividend from the corpora-tion in which it owns less than a controlling interest or when the taxpayer receives its allocable share of income, deductions, gains, and losses on its Sched-ule K–1 from the partnership). 
873For purposes of the provision, the term ‘‘appli-cable financial statement’’ means: (A) a financial statement which is certified as being prepared in ac-cordance with generally accepted accounting prin-ciples and which is (i) a 10–K (or successor form), or annual statement to shareholders, required to be filed by the taxpayer with the United States Securi-ties and Exchange Commission (‘‘SEC’’), (ii) an au-dited financial statement of the taxpayer which is used for (I) credit purposes, (II) reporting to share-holders, partners, or other proprietors, or to bene-ficiaries, or (III) any other substantial nontax pur-pose, but only if there is no statement of the tax-payer described in clause (i), or (iii) filed by the tax-payer with any other Federal agency for purposes other than Federal tax purposes, but only if there is no statement of the taxpayer described in clause (i) or (ii); (B) a financial statement which is made on the basis of international financial reporting stand-ards and is filed by the taxpayer with an agency of a foreign government which is equivalent to the SEC and which has reporting standards not less stringent than the standards required by such Com-mission, but only if there is no statement of the tax-payer described in subparagraph (A); or (C) a finan-cial statement filed by the taxpayer with any other regulatory or governmental body specified by the Secretary, but only if there is no statement of the taxpayer described in subparagraph (A) or (B). If the financial results of a taxpayer are reported on the applicable financial statement for a group of enti-ties, such statement is treated as the applicable fi-nancial statement of the taxpayer. to amortize their research or experimental expenditures over a period of 10 years.
851 Effective date.—The provision applies to amounts paid or incurred in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2022. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The Senate amendment follows the House bill, except with the following modifications. The application of the Senate amendment is treated as a change in the taxpayer’s method of accounting for purposes of section 481, ini-tiated by the taxpayer, and made with the consent of the Secretary. The Senate amend-ment is applied on a cutoff basis to research or experimental expenditures paid or in-curred in taxable years beginning after De-cember 31, 2025 (hence there is no adjustment under section 481(a) for research or experi-mental expenditures paid or incurred in tax-able years beginning before January 1, 2026). In addition, the Senate amendment makes conforming changes to sections 41 and 280C. Effective date.—The provision applies to amounts paid or incurred in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the Sen-ate amendment. Effective date.—The provision applies to amounts paid or incurred in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2021. 17. Certain special rules for taxable year of inclusion (sec. 13221 of the Senate amend-ment and sec. 451 of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  In general Under section 61(a), gross income generally includes all income from whatever source de-rived, except as otherwise provided in Sub-title A of the Code. Thus, gross income gen-erally includes income realized in any from, whether in money, property, or services, ex-cept to the extent provided in other sections of the Code.
852Once it is determined that an item of gross income is clearly realized for Federal income tax purposes, section 451 and the regulations thereunder provide the gen-eral rules as to the timing of when such item is to be included in gross income.
853 A taxpayer generally is required to include an item in gross income no later than the time of its actual or constructive receipt, unless the item properly is accounted for in a different period under the taxpayer’s meth-od of accounting.
854If a taxpayer has an un-restricted right to demand the payment of an amount, the taxpayer is in constructive receipt of that amount whether or not the taxpayer makes the demand and actually re-ceives the payment.
855 In general, for a cash basis taxpayer, an amount is included in gross income when ac-tually or constructively received. For an ac-crual basis taxpayer, an amount is included in gross income when all the events have oc-curred that fix the right to receive such in-come and the amount thereof can be deter-mined with reasonable accuracy ( i.e., when the ‘‘all events test’’ is met), unless an ex-ception permits deferral or exclusion, or a special method of accounting applies.
856 A number of exceptions that exist to per-mit deferral of gross income relate to ad-vance payments. An advance payment is when a taxpayer receives payment before the taxpayer provides goods or services to its customer. The exceptions often allow tax de-ferral to mirror financial accounting deferral (e.g., income is recognized as the goods are provided or the services are performed).857 Interest income A taxpayer generally must include in gross income the amount of interest received or accrued within the taxable year on indebted-ness held by the taxpayer.
858 Original issue discount The holder of a debt instrument with origi-nal issue discount (‘‘OID’’) generally accrues and includes the OID in gross income as in-terest over the term of the instrument, re-gardless of when the stated interest (if any) is paid.
859 The amount of OID with respect to a debt instrument is the excess of the stated re-demption price at maturity over the issue price of the debt instrument.
860The stated redemption price at maturity is the sum of all payments provided by the debt instru-ment other than qualified stated interest payments.
861The holder includes in gross in-come an amount equal to the sum of the daily portions of the OID for each day during the taxable year the holder held such debt instrument. The daily portion is determined by allocating to each day in any accrual pe-riod its ratable portion of the increase dur-ing such accrual period in the adjusted issue price of the debt instrument.
862The adjust- ment to the issue price is determined by multiplying the adjusted issue price ( i.e., the issue price increased by adjustments prior to the accrual period) by the instrument’s yield to maturity, and then subtracting the inter-est payable during the accrual period. Thus, to compute the amount of OID and the por-tion of OID allocable to a period, the stated redemption price at maturity and the term must be known. Issuers of OID instruments accrue and deduct the amount of OID as in-terest expense in the same manner as the holder.
863 Debt instruments subject to acceleration Special rules for determining the amount of OID allocated to a period apply to certain instruments that may be subject to prepay-ment. If a borrower can reduce the yield on a debt by exercising a prepayment option, the OID rules assume that the borrower will prepay the debt.
864In addition, in the case of (1) any regular interest in a real estate mort-gage investment conduit (‘‘REMIC’’) or qualified mortgages held by a REMIC or (2) any other debt instrument if payments under the instrument may be accelerated by reason of prepayments of other obligations securing the instrument, the daily portions of the OID on such debt instruments are determined by taking into account an assumption regarding the prepayment of principal for such instru-ments.
865 The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997
866ex- tended these rules to any pool of debt instru-ments the payments on which may be accel-erated by reason of prepayments.
867Thus, if a taxpayer holds a pool of credit card receiv-ables that require interest to be paid only if the borrowers do not pay their accounts by a specified date (‘‘grace-period interest’’), the taxpayer is required to accrue interest or OID on such pool based upon a reasonable as-sumption regarding the timing of the pay-ments of the accounts in the pool. Under these rules, certain amounts (other than grace-period interest) related to credit card transactions, such as late-payment fees,868 cash-advance fees,
869and interchange fees,870 have been determined to create OID or in-crease the amount of OID on the pool of credit card receivables to which the amounts relate.
871 
HOUSE BILL  No provision. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The provision revises the rules associated with the timing of the recognition of in-come.
872Specifically, the provision requires an accrual method taxpayer subject to the all events test for an item of gross income to recognize such income no later than the tax-able year in which such income is taken into account as revenue in an applicable financial statement
873or another financial statement under rules specified by the Secretary, but provides an exception for taxpayers without

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H10059 December 15, 2017 
874The Committee intends that the provision apply to items of gross income for which the timing of in-come inclusion is determined using the all events test under present law. Under the provision, an ac-crual method taxpayer with an applicable financial statement will include an item in income under sec-tion 451 upon the earlier of when the all events test is met or when the taxpayer includes such item in revenue in an applicable financial statement. For example, under the provision, any unbilled receiv-ables for partially performed services must be recog-nized to the extent the amounts are taken into in-come for financial statement purposes. However, ac-crual method taxpayers without an applicable or other specified financial statement will continue to determine income inclusion under the all events test, unless an exception permits deferral or exclu-sion. See sec. 451(a) and Treas. Reg. sec. 1.451–1(a). The Committee intends that the financial statement conformity requirement added to section 451 not be construed as preventing the use of special methods of accounting provided elsewhere in the Code, other than part V of subchapter P (special rules for bonds and other debt instruments) excluding items of gross income in connection with a mortgage serv-icing contract. For example, it does not preclude the use of the installment method under section 453 or the use of long-term contract methods under section 460. See Treas. Reg. sec. 1.446–1(c)(1)(iii). 
875Secs. 1271–1288. 
876See Rev. Rul. 70–142, 1970–2 C.B. 115. 
877See Rev. Rul. 91–6, 1991–2, C.B. 358, and Rev. Proc. 91–50, 1991–2 C.B. 778.

879The election shall be made at such time, in such form and manner, and with respect to such cat-egories of advance payments as the Secretary may provide. For these purposes, the recognition of in-come under such election is treated as a method of accounting. 880Thus, the provision is intended to override any deferral method provided by Treasury Regulation section 1.451 095 for advance payments received for goods. 
881Sec. 162(f). 
882Thus, for example, the provision does not apply to payments made by one private party to another in a lawsuit between private parties, merely because a judge or jury acting in the capacity as a court di-rects the payment to be made. The mere fact that a court enters a judgment or directs a result in a pri-vate dispute does not cause the payment to be made ‘‘at the direction of a government’’ for purposes of the provision. 
883Sec. 162(a). an applicable or other specified financial statement.
874In the case of a contract which contains multiple performance obligations, the provision allows the taxpayer to allocate the transaction price in accordance with the allocation made in the taxpayer’s applicable financial statement. In addition, the provision directs accrual method taxpayers with an applicable finan-cial statement to apply the income recogni-tion rules under section 451 before applying the special rules under part V of subchapter P, which, in addition to the OID rules, also includes rules regarding the treatment of market discount on bonds, discounts on short-term obligations, OID on tax-exempt bonds, and stripped bonds and stripped cou-pons.
875Thus, for example, to the extent amounts are included in revenue for finan-cial statement purposes when received ( e.g., late-payment fees, cash-advance fees, or interchange fees), such amounts generally are includable in income at such time in ac-cordance with the general recognition prin-ciples under section 451. The provision pro-vides an exception for any item of gross in-come in connection with a mortgage serv-icing contract. Thus, under the provision, in-come from mortgage servicing rights will continue to be recognized in accordance with the present law rules for such items of gross income (i.e., ‘‘normal’’ mortgage servicing rights will be included in income upon the earlier of earned or received under the all events test of section 451 (i.e., not averaged over the life of the mortgage),
876and ‘‘ex- cess’’ mortgage servicing rights will be treated as stripped coupons under section 1286 and therefore subject to the original issue discount rules
877). The provision also codifies the current de-ferral method of accounting for advance pay-ments for goods, services, and other specified items provided by the IRS under Revenue Procedure 2004–34.
878That is, the provision allows accrual method taxpayers to elect
879 to defer the inclusion of income associated with certain advance payments to the end of the tax year following the tax year of receipt if such income also is deferred for financial statement purposes.880In the case of advance payments received for a combination of serv-ices, goods, or other specified items, the pro-vision allows the taxpayer to allocate the transaction price in accordance with the al-location made in the taxpayer’s applicable financial statement. The provision requires the inclusion in gross income of a deferred advance payment if the taxpayer ceases to exist. The application of these rules is a change in the taxpayer’s method of accounting for purposes of section 481. In the case of any taxpayer required by this provision to change its method of accounting for its first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017, such change is treated as initiated by the taxpayer and made with the consent of the Secretary. In the case of income from a debt instrument having OID, the related sec-tion 481(a) adjustment is taken into account over six taxable years. Effective date.—The provision generally ap-plies to taxable years beginning after De-cember 31, 2017. In the case of income from a debt instrument having OID, the provision applies to taxable years beginning after De-cember 31, 2018. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the Sen-ate amendment. 18. Denial of deduction for certain fines, pen-alties, and other amounts (sec. 13306 of the Senate amendment and sec. 162(f) and new sec. 6050X of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  The Code denies a deduction for fines or penalties paid to a government for the viola-tion of any law.
881 
HOUSE BILL  No provision. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The provision denies deductibility for any otherwise deductible amount paid or in-curred (whether by suit, agreement, or oth-erwise) to or at the direction of a govern-ment or specified nongovernmental entity in relation to the violation of any law or the in-vestigation or inquiry by such government or entity into the potential violation of any law. An exception applies to payments that the taxpayer establishes are either restitu-tion (including remediation of property) or amounts required to come into compliance with any law that was violated or involved in the investigation or inquiry, that are identified in the court order or settlement agreement as restitution, remediation, or re-quired to come into compliance. In the case of any amount of restitution for failure to pay any tax and assessed as restitution under the Code, such restitution is deduct-ible only to the extent it would have been al-lowed as a deduction if it had been timely paid. The IRS remains free to challenge the characterization of an amount so identified; however, no deduction is allowed unless the identification is made. Restitution or in-cluded remediation of property does not in-clude reimbursement of government inves-tigative or litigation costs. The provision applies only where a govern-ment (or other entity treated in a manner similar to a government under the provision) is a complainant or investigator with respect to the violation or potential violation of any law.
882An exception also applies to any amount paid or incurred as taxes due. The provision requires government agen-cies (or entities treated as such agencies under the provision) to report to the IRS and to the taxpayer the amount of each settle-ment agreement or order entered into where the aggregate amount required to be paid or incurred to or at the direction of the govern-ment is at least $600 (or such other amount as may be specified by the Secretary of the Treasury as necessary to ensure the efficient administration of the Internal Revenue laws). The report must separately identify any amounts that are for restitution or re-mediation of property, or correction of non-compliance. The report must be made at the time the agreement is entered into, as deter-mined by the Secretary of the Treasury. Effective date.—The provision denying the deduction and the reporting provision are ef-fective for amounts paid or incurred on or after the date of enactment, except that it would not apply to amounts paid or incurred under any binding order or agreement en-tered into before such date. Such exception does not apply to an order or agreement re-quiring court approval unless the approval was obtained before such date. CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the Sen-ate amendment. 19. Denial of deduction for settlements sub-ject to nondisclosure agreements paid in connection with sexual harassment or sexual abuse (sec. 13307 of the Senate amendment and new sec. 162(q) of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  A taxpayer generally is allowed a deduc-tion for ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred in carrying on any trade or business.
883However, certain exceptions apply. No deduction is allowed for (1) any charitable contribution or gift that would be allowable as a deduction under section 170 were it not for the percentage limitations, the dollar limitations, or the requirements as to the time of payment, set forth in such section; (2) any illegal bribe, illegal kick-back, or other illegal payment; (3) certain lobbying and political expenditures; (4) any fine or similar penalty paid to a government for the violation of any law; (5) two-thirds of treble damage payments under the antitrust laws; (6) certain foreign advertising ex-penses; (7) certain amounts paid or incurred by a corporation in connection with the re-acquisition of its stock or of the stock of any related person; or (8) certain applicable em-ployee remuneration. 
HOUSE BILL  No provision. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  Under the provision, no deduction is al-lowed for any settlement, payout, or attor-ney fees related to sexual harassment or sex-ual abuse if such payments are subject to a nondisclosure agreement. Effective date.—The provision is effective for amounts paid or incurred after the date of enactment. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the Sen-ate amendment.

Uniform treatment of expenses in contin-gency fee cases (sec. 3316 of the House bill and new sec. 162(q) of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  The Code provides that a taxpayer may de-duct all ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on a trade or business.
884 A current deduction for an expense for which there is a right or expectation of reim-bursement may be disallowed because these payments are not expenses of the taxpayer and are instead in the nature of an advance or a loan. The extent to which the right must be established has varied. Some cases have denied the current deduction because the right of reimbursement was fixed,
885oth- ers have allowed the current deduction be-cause the right of reimbursement was uncer-tain,
886and other cases have denied the cur-rent deduction if the taxpayer’s right to re-imbursement was subject to a contingency. Courts have held that an attorney rep-resenting clients on a contingent fee basis may not currently deduct advances to or ex-penses paid on behalf of the clients as ordi-nary and necessary business expenses.
887The amounts in these cases were to be repaid from any recovery. Courts have also held that even if reimbursement is due only under certain circumstances, generally no imme-diate deduction is allowable.
888 However, the Ninth Circuit reached the op-posite conclusion and held that attorneys who represent clients in ‘‘gross fee’’ contin-gency fee cases are not extending loans to clients and therefore may treat litigation costs, such as court fees and witness ex-penses, as deductible business expenses under the Code.
889The IRS does not follow this de-cision, except in the Ninth Circuit, based on the fact that amounts advanced by attorneys will be reimbursed by the client and there-fore are not deductible business expenses.
890 
HOUSE BILL  The provision denies attorneys an other-wise-allowable deduction for litigation costs paid under arrangements that are primarily on a contingent fee basis until the contin-gency ends. The provision effects a legislative override of the opinion in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in Boccardo v. Commissioner, 56 F.3d 1016 (9th Cir. 1995). No inference regarding the tax treatment of these costs under present law is intended. Effective date.—The provision applies to ex-penses and costs paid or incurred in taxable years beginning after the date of enactment. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  No provision. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement does not follow the House bill provision. E. Reform of Business Credits 1. Repeal of credit for clinical testing ex-penses for certain drugs for rare diseases or conditions (sec. 3401 of the House bill, sec. 13401 of the Senate amendment, and sec. 45C of the Code) PRESENT LAW  Section 45C provides a 50-percent business tax credit for qualified clinical testing ex-penses incurred in testing of certain drugs for rare diseases or conditions, generally re-ferred to as ‘‘orphan drugs.’’ Qualified clin-ical testing expenses are costs incurred to test an orphan drug after the drug has been approved for human testing by the Food and Drug Administration (‘‘FDA’’) but before the drug has been approved for sale by the FDA.
891A rare disease or condition is defined as one that (1) affects fewer than 200,000 per-sons in the United States, or (2) affects more than 200,000 persons, but for which there is no reasonable expectation that businesses could recoup the costs of developing a drug for such disease or condition from sales in the United States of the drug.
892 Amounts included in computing the credit under this section are excluded from the computation of the research credit under section 41.
893 
HOUSE BILL  The House bill repeals the credit for quali-fied clinical testing expenses. Effective date.—The provision applies to amounts paid or incurred in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The Senate amendment reduces the credit rate to 27.5 percent of qualified clinical test-ing expenses. Effective date.—The provision applies to amounts paid or incurred in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the Sen-ate amendment, but reduces the credit rate to 25 percent of qualified clinical testing ex-penses. 2. Repeal of employer-provided child care credit (sec. 3402 of the House bill and sec. 42F of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  Taxpayers are eligible for a tax credit equal to 25 percent of qualified expenditures for employee child care and 10 percent of qualified expenditures for child care resource and referral services. The maximum total credit that may be claimed by a taxpayer may not exceed $150,000 per taxable year. The credit is part of the general business cred-it.
894 Qualified child care expenditures generally include costs paid or incurred: (1) to acquire, construct, rehabilitate or expand property that is to be used as part of the taxpayer’s qualified child care facility;
895(2) for the op-eration of the taxpayer’s qualified child care facility, including the costs of training and certain compensation for employees of the child care facility, and scholarship pro-grams; or (3) under a contract with a quali-fied child care facility to provide child care services to employees of the taxpayer. To be a qualified child care facility, the principal use of the facility must be for child care (un-less it is the principal residence of the tax-payer), and the facility must meet all appli-cable State and local laws and regulations, including any licensing laws. Qualified child care expenditures for re-source and referral services include amounts paid under contract to provide child care re-source and referral services to a taxpayer’s employees. HOUSE BILL  The House bill repeals the credit for quali-fied child care expenditures and qualified child care expenditures for resource and re-ferral services. Effective date.—The provision applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  No provision. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The Conference agreement does not follow the House bill provision. 3. Rehabilitation credit (sec. 3403 of the House bill, sec. 13402 of the Senate amendment, and sec. 47 of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  Section 47 provides a two-tier tax credit for rehabilitation expenditures. A 20-percent credit is provided for qualified rehabilitation expenditures with respect to a certified historic structure. For this purpose, a certified historic structure means any building that is listed in the National Reg-ister, or that is located in a registered his-toric district and is certified by the Sec-retary of the Interior to the Secretary of the Treasury as being of historic significance to the district. A 10-percent credit is provided for qualified rehabilitation expenditures with respect to a qualified rehabilitated building, which gen-erally means a building that was first placed in service before 1936. A pre-1936 building must meet requirements with respect to re-tention of existing external walls and inter-nal structural framework of the building in order for expenditures with respect to it to qualify for the 10-percent credit. A building is treated as having met the substantial re-habilitation requirement under the 10-per-cent credit only if the rehabilitation expend-itures during the 24-month period selected by the taxpayer and ending within the taxable year exceed the greater of (1) the adjusted basis of the building (and its structural com-ponents), or (2) $5,000. The provision requires the use of straight- line depreciation or the alternative deprecia-tion system in order for rehabilitation ex-penditures to be treated as qualified under the provision. 
HOUSE BILL  The House bill repeals the rehabilitation credit. Effective date.—The provision applies to amounts paid or incurred after December 31, 2017. A transition rule provides that in the case of qualified rehabilitation expenditures (within the meaning of present law), with re-spect to any building owned or leased by the taxpayer at all times on and after January 1, 2018, the 24-month period selected by the tax-payer (under section 47(c)(1)(C)) is to begin not later than the end of the 180-day period beginning on the date of the enactment of the Act, and the amendments made by the provision apply to such expenditures paid or incurred after the end of the taxable year in which such 24-month period ends. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The Senate amendment repeals the 10-per-cent credit for pre-1936 buildings. The provi-sion retains the 20-percent credit for quali-fied rehabilitation expenditures with respect to a certified historic structure, with a modi-fication. Under the provision, the credit al-lowable for a taxable year during the five-

The ratable share for a taxable year during the five-year period is amount equal to 20 percent of the qualified rehabili-tation expenditures for the building, as allo-cated ratably to each taxable year during the five-year period. It is intended that the sum of the ratable shares for the taxable years during the five-year period does not ex-ceed 100 percent of the credit for qualified re-habilitation expenditures for the qualified rehabilitated building. Effective date.—The provision applies to amounts paid or incurred after December 31, 2017. A transition rule provides that in the case of qualified rehabilitation expenditures (for a pre-1936 building) with respect to any building owned or leased (as provided under present law) by the taxpayer at all times on and after January 1, 2018, the 24-month pe-riod selected by the taxpayer (under section 47(c)(1)(C)) is to begin not later than the end of the 180-day period beginning on the date of the enactment of the Act, and the amend-ments made by the provision apply to such expenditures paid or incurred after the end of the taxable year in which such 24-month period ends. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the Sen-ate amendment with a modification to the transition rule under the effective date re-lating to qualified rehabilitation expendi-tures under certain phased rehabilitations for which the taxpayer may select a 60- month period. Effective date.—The provision applies to amounts paid or incurred after December 31, 2017. A transition rule provides that in the case of qualified rehabilitation expenditures (for either a certified historic structure or a pre-1936 building), with respect to any build-ing owned or leased (as provided under present law) by the taxpayer at all times on and after January 1, 2018, the 24-month pe-riod selected by the taxpayer (section 47(c)(1)(C)(i)), or the 60-month period selected by the taxpayer under the rule for phased re-habilitation (section 47(c)(1)(C)(ii)), is to begin not later than the end of the 180-day period beginning on the date of the enact-ment of the Act, and the amendments made by the provision apply to such expenditures paid or incurred after the end of the taxable year in which such 24-month or 60-month pe-riod ends. 4. Repeal of work opportunity tax credit (sec. 3404 of the House bill and sec. 51 of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  In general The work opportunity tax credit is avail-able on an elective basis for employers hir-ing individuals from one or more of ten tar-geted groups. The amount of the credit avail-able to an employer is determined by the amount of qualified wages paid by the em-ployer. Generally, qualified wages consist of wages attributable to services rendered by a member of a targeted group during the one- year period beginning with the day the indi-vidual begins work for the employer (two years in the case of an individual in the long- term family assistance recipient category). Targeted groups eligible for the credit Generally, an employer is eligible for the credit only for qualified wages paid to mem-bers of a targeted group. These targeted groups are: (1) Families receiving TANF; (2) Qualified veterans; (3) Qualified ex-felons; (4) Designated community residents; (5) Voca-tional rehabilitation referrals; (6) Qualified summer youth employees; (7) Qualified food and nutrition recipients; (8) Qualified SSI re-cipients; (9) Long-term family assistance re-cipients; and (10) Qualified long-term unem-ployment recipients. Qualified wages Generally, qualified wages are defined as cash wages paid by the employer to a mem-ber of a targeted group. The employer’s de-duction for wages is reduced by the amount of the credit. For purposes of the credit, generally, wages are defined by reference to the FUTA definition of wages contained in section 3306(b) (without regard to the dollar limita-tion therein contained). Special rules apply in the case of certain agricultural labor and certain railroad labor. Calculation of the credit The credit available to an employer for qualified wages paid to members of all tar-geted groups (except for long-term family as-sistance recipients and qualified veterans) equals 40 percent (25 percent for employment of 400 hours or less) of qualified first-year wages. Generally, qualified first-year wages are qualified wages (not in excess of $6,000) attributable to service rendered by a mem-ber of a targeted group during the one-year period beginning with the day the individual began work for the employer. Therefore, the maximum credit per employee is $2,400 (40 percent of the first $6,000 of qualified first- year wages). With respect to qualified sum-mer youth employees, the maximum credit is $1,200 (40 percent of the first $3,000 of quali-fied first-year wages). Except for long-term family assistance recipients, no credit is al-lowed for second-year wages. In the case of long-term family assistance recipients, the credit equals 40 percent (25 percent for employment of 400 hours or less) of $10,000 for qualified first-year wages and 50 percent of the first $10,000 of qualified sec-ond-year wages. Generally, qualified second- year wages are qualified wages (not in excess of $10,000) attributable to service rendered by a member of the long-term family assistance category during the one-year period begin-ning on the day after the one-year period be-ginning with the day the individual began work for the employer. Therefore, the max-imum credit per employee is $9,000 (40 per-cent of the first $10,000 of qualified first-year wages plus 50 percent of the first $10,000 of qualified second-year wages). In the case of a qualified veterans, the credit is calculated as follows: (1) in the case of a qualified veteran who was eligible to re-ceive assistance under a supplemental nutri-tional assistance program (for at least a three-month period during the year prior to the hiring date) the employer is entitled to a maximum credit of 40 percent of $6,000 of qualified first-year wages; (2) in the case of a qualified veteran who is entitled to com-pensation for a service connected disability, who is hired within one year of discharge, the employer is entitled to a maximum cred-it of 40 percent of $12,000 of qualified first- year wages; (3) in the case of a qualified vet-eran who is entitled to compensation for a service connected disability, and who has been unemployed for an aggregate of at least six months during the one-year period end-ing on the hiring date, the employer is enti-tled to a maximum credit of 40 percent of $24,000 of qualified first-year wages; (4) in the case of a qualified veteran unemployed for at least four weeks but less than six months (whether or not consecutive) during the one- year period ending on the date of hiring, the maximum credit equals 40 percent of $6,000 of qualified first-year wages; and (5) in the case of a qualified veteran unemployed for at least six months (whether or not consecu-tive) during the one-year period ending on the date of hiring, the maximum credit equals 40 percent of $14,000 of qualified first- year wages. Expiration The work opportunity tax credit is not available with respect to wages paid to indi-viduals who begin work for an employer after December 31, 2019. HOUSE BILL  The provision repeals the work oppor-tunity tax credit. Effective date.—The provision applies to amounts paid or incurred to individuals who begin work for the employer after December 31, 2017. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  No provision. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement does not follow the House bill provision. 5. Repeal of deduction for certain unused business credits (sec. 3405 of the House bill, sec. 13403 of the Senate amendment, and sec. 196 of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  The general business credit (‘‘GBC’’) con-sists of various individual tax credits al-lowed with respect to certain qualified ex-penditures and activities.
896In general, the various individual tax credits contain provi-sions that prohibit ‘‘double benefits,’’ either by denying deductions in the case of expendi-ture-related credits or by requiring income inclusions in the case of activity-related credits. Unused credits may be carried back one year and carried forward 20 years.
897 Section 196 allows a deduction to the ex-tent that certain portions of the GBC expire unused after the end of the carry forward pe-riod. In general, 100 percent of the unused credit is allowed as a deduction in the tax-able year after such credit expired. However, with respect to the investment credit deter-mined under section 46 (other than the reha-bilitation credit) and the research credit de-termined under section 41(a) (for a taxable year beginning before January 1, 1990), sec-tion 196 limits the deduction to 50 percent of such unused credits.
898 
HOUSE BILL  This provision repeals the deduction for certain unused business credits. Effective date.—The provision applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The Senate amendment follows the House bill. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement does not follow the House bill provision. 6. Termination of new markets tax credit (sec. 3406 of the House bill and sec. 45D of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  Section 45D provides a new markets tax credit for qualified equity investments made to acquire stock in a corporation, or a cap-ital interest in a partnership, that is a quali-fied community development entity (‘‘CDE’’).
899The amount of the credit allow-able to the investor (either the original pur-chaser or a subsequent holder) is (1) a five- percent credit for the year in which the eq-uity interest is purchased from the CDE and for each of the following two years, and (2) a six-percent credit for each of the following four years.
900The credit is determined by ap-plying the applicable percentage (five or six

913Expenses related to this removal are not eligi-ble in connection with facilities placed in service after November 5, 1990. Sec. 44(c)(4). 914For this definition, an employee is considered full-time if employed at least 30 hours per week for 20 or more calendar weeks in the taxable year. 
915FICA taxes consist of social security (OASDI, or old age, survivor, and disability insurance) and hos-pital (Medicare) taxes imposed on employers and employees with respect to wages paid to employees under sections 3101–3128. 
916Sec. 45B. As of January 1, 2007, the Federal min-imum wage under the FLSA was $5.15 per hour. In the case of tipped employees, the FLSA provided that the minimum wage could be reduced to $2.13 per hour (that is, the employer is only required to pay cash equal to $2.13 per hour) if the combination of tips and cash income equaled the Federal minimum wage.

901The credit is recaptured if at any time during the seven-year period that begins on the date of the original issue of the investment the entity (1) ceases to be a qualified CDE, (2) the proceeds of the invest-ment cease to be used as required, or (3) the equity investment is redeemed.
902 A qualified CDE is any domestic corpora-tion or partnership: (1) whose primary mis-sion is serving or providing investment cap-ital for low-income communities or low-in-come persons; (2) that maintains account-ability to residents of low-income commu-nities by their representation on any gov-erning board of or any advisory board to the CDE; and (3) that is certified by the Sec-retary as being a qualified CDE.
903A quali- fied equity investment means stock (other than nonqualified preferred stock) in a cor-poration or a capital interest in a partner-ship that is acquired at its original issue di-rectly (or through an underwriter) from a CDE for cash, and includes an investment of a subsequent purchaser if such investment was a qualified equity investment in the hands of the prior holder.
904Substantially all of the investment proceeds must be used by the CDE to make qualified low-income com-munity investments and the investment must be designated as a qualified equity in-vestment by the CDE. For this purpose, qualified low-income community invest-ments include: (1) capital or equity invest-ments in, or loans to, qualified active low-in-come community businesses; (2) certain fi-nancial counseling and other services to businesses and residents in low-income com-munities; (3) the purchase from another CDE of any loan made by such entity that is a qualified low-income community invest-ment; or (4) an equity investment in, or loan to, another CDE.
905 A ‘‘low-income community’’ is a popu-lation census tract with either (1) a poverty rate of at least 20 percent or (2) median fam-ily income which does not exceed 80 percent of the greater of metropolitan area median family income or statewide median family income (for a non-metropolitan census tract, does not exceed 80 percent of statewide me-dian family income). In the case of a popu-lation census tract located within a high mi-gration rural county, low-income is defined by reference to 85 percent (as opposed to 80 percent) of statewide median family in-come.
906For this purpose, a high migration rural county is any county that, during the 20-year period ending with the year in which the most recent census was conducted, has a net out-migration of inhabitants from the county of at least 10 percent of the popu-lation of the county at the beginning of such period. The Secretary is authorized to designate ‘‘targeted populations’’ as low-income com-munities for purposes of the new markets tax credit.
907For this purpose, a ‘‘targeted population’’ is defined by reference to sec-tion 103(20) of the Riegle Community Devel-opment and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994
908(the ‘‘Act’’) to mean individuals, or an identifiable group of individuals, including an Indian tribe, who are low-income persons or otherwise lack adequate access to loans or equity investments. Section 103(17) of the Act provides that ‘‘low-income’’ means (1) for a targeted population within a metropoli-tan area, less than 80 percent of the area me-dian family income; and (2) for a targeted population within a non-metropolitan area, less than the greater of 80 percent of the area median family income or 80 percent of the statewide non-metropolitan area median family income. A targeted population is not required to be within any census tract. In ad-dition, a population census tract with a pop-ulation of less than 2,000 is treated as a low- income community for purposes of the credit if such tract is within an empowerment zone, the designation of which is in effect under section 1391, and is contiguous to one or more low-income communities. A qualified active low-income community business is defined as a business that satis-fies, with respect to a taxable year, the fol-lowing requirements: (1) at least 50 percent of the total gross income of the business is derived from the active conduct of trade or business activities in any low-income com-munity; (2) a substantial portion of the tan-gible property of the business is used in a low-income community; (3) a substantial portion of the services performed for the business by its employees is performed in a low-income community; and (4) less than five percent of the average of the aggregate unadjusted bases of the property of the busi-ness is attributable to certain financial prop-erty or to certain collectibles.909 The maximum annual amount of qualified equity investments is $3.5 billion for cal-endar years 2010 through 2019. No amount of unused allocation limitation may be carried to any calendar year after 2024. 
HOUSE BILL  This provision provides that the new mar-kets tax credit limitation is zero for cal-endar year 2018 and thereafter and no amount of unused allocation limitation may be carried to any calendar year after 2022. Effective date.—The provision applies to calendar years beginning after December 31, 2017. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  No provision. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement does not follow the House bill provision. 7. Repeal of credit for expenditures to provide access to disabled individuals (sec. 3407 of the House bill and sec. 44 of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  Section 44 provides a 50-percent credit for eligible access expenditures paid or incurred by an eligible small business for the taxable year. The credit is limited to eligible access expenditures exceeding $250 but not exceed-ing 10,500. The credit is part of the general business credit.
910 Eligible access expenditures generally means amounts paid or incurred by an eligi-ble small business to comply with require-ments under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.
911These expenditures912include: (1) removal of architectural, communication, physical or transportation barriers which prevent a business from being usable or ac-cessible to individuals with disabilities;
913(2) provision of qualified interpreters or other effective methods of making aurally-deliv-ered materials available to individuals with hearing impairments; (3) provision of quali-fied readers, taped texts, or other effective methods of making visually-delivered mate-rials available to individuals with visual im-pairments; (4) acquisition or modification of equipment or devices for individuals with disabilities; or (5) provision of other similar services, modifications, materials or equip-ment. An eligible small business means any per-son that elects application of section 44 and, during the preceding taxable year, (1) had gross receipts not exceeding $1,000,000 or (2) employed not more than 30 full-time employ-ees.914 
HOUSE BILL  The House bill repeals the credit for eligi-ble access expenditures. Effective date.—The provision applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017.

915paid on tips in excess of those treated as wages for purposes of meeting the minimum wage requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act (the ‘‘FLSA’’) as in ef-fect on January 1, 2007.
916The credit applies only with respect to FICA taxes paid on tips received from customers in connection with the providing, delivering, or serving of food or beverages for consumption if the tipping of employees delivering or serving food or beverages by customers is customary. The credit is available whether or not the tips are reported or a percentage of gross receipts is allocated (described below). No deduction is allowed for any amount taken into ac-count in determining the tip credit. A tax-payer may elect not to have the credit apply for a taxable year. Reporting and allocation requirements Employees are required to report monthly tips to their employer.

919Employee tip income that is reported by employees is treated as employer-provided wages subject to FICA. 
HOUSE BILL  The provision revises the amount of the credit for FICA taxes an employer pays on tips, as an amount equal to the employer’s FICA taxes paid on tips in excess of those treated as minimum wages under the FLSA without regard to the January 1, 2007 date. For 2017, this amount is $7.25. In addition, the credit is permitted only if the employer satisfies the reporting requirements of sec-tion 6053(c) to the IRS and employees, and allocates among employees who customarily receive tip income an amount equal to 10 percent (rather than eight percent) of gross receipts in excess of the amount of tips re-ported by such employees. The claiming of the credit remains elective. However, if any size eligible food or beverage establishment elects to claim the FICA tip credit for any taxable year after the provision takes effect, the establishment must satisfy this report-ing and 10-percent allocation requirement for that taxable year. Reporting and alloca-tion requirements for food and beverage es-tablishments that elect not to claim the credit remain unchanged. Effective date.—The provision applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  No provision. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement does not follow the House bill provision. 9. Employer credit for paid family and med-ical leave (sec. 13403 of the Senate amendment, and new sec. 45S of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  Present law does not provide a credit to employers for compensation paid to employ-ees while on leave. 
HOUSE BILL  No provision. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The provision allows eligible employers to claim a general business credit equal to 12.5 percent of the amount of wages paid to quali-fying employees during any period in which such employees are on family and medical leave if the rate of payment under the pro-gram is 50 percent of the wages normally paid to an employee. The credit is increased by 0.25 percentage points (but not above 25 percent) for each percentage point by which the rate of payment exceeds 50 percent. The maximum amount of family and medical leave that may be taken into account with respect to any employee for any taxable year is 12 weeks. An eligible employer is one who has in place a written policy that allows all quali-fying full-time employees not less than two weeks of annual paid family and medical leave, and who allows all less-than-full-time qualifying employees a commensurate amount of leave on a pro rata basis. For pur-poses of this requirement, leave paid for by a State or local government is not taken into account. A ‘‘qualifying employee’’ means any employee as defined in section 3(e) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 who has been employed by the employer for one year or more, and who for the preceding year, had compensation not in excess of 60 percent of the compensation threshold for highly com-pensated employees.920The Secretary will make determinations as to whether an em-ployer or an employee satisfies the applica-ble requirements for an eligible employer or qualifying employee, based on information provided by the employer. ‘‘Family and medical leave’’ is defined as leave described under sections 102(a)(1)(a)-(e) or 102(a)(3) of the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993.
921If an employer provides paid leave as vacation leave, personal leave, or other medical or sick leave, this paid leave would not be considered to be family and medical leave. This proposal would not apply to wages paid in taxable years beginning after Decem-ber 31, 2019. Effective date.—The provision is generally effective for wages paid in taxable years be-ginning after December 31, 2017. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the Sen-ate amendment. F. Energy Credits 1. Modifications to credit for electricity pro-duced from certain renewable resources (sec. 3501 of the House bill and sec. 45 of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  In general An income tax credit is allowed for the production of electricity from qualified en-ergy resources at qualified facilities (the ‘‘renewable electricity production cred-it’’).
922Qualified energy resources comprise wind, closed-loop biomass, open-loop bio-mass, geothermal energy, municipal solid waste, qualified hydropower production, and marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy. Qualified facilities are, generally, facilities that generate electricity using qualified en-ergy resources. To be eligible for the credit, electricity produced from qualified energy resources at qualified facilities must be sold by the taxpayer to an unrelated person.

Taxpayers may also elect to get a 30-percent investment tax credit in lieu of this production tax credit.924 Phase-down for wind facilities In the case of wind facilities, the available production tax credit or investment tax credit is reduced by 20 percent for facilities the construction of which begins in 2017, by 40 percent for facilities the construction of which begins in 2018, and by 60 percent for fa-cilities the construction of which begins in 2019. Special rules for determining when the con-struction of a facility begins In general, a taxpayer may establish the beginning of construction of a facility by be-ginning physical work of a significant nature (the ‘‘physical work test’’).
925Alternatively, a taxpayer may establish the beginning of construction by meeting the safe harbor test which generally requires that the taxpayer have paid or incurred five percent of the total cost of constructing the facility (the ‘‘five percent safe harbor’’).
926Both methods require that a taxpayer make continuous progress towards completion once construc-tion has begun.
927To demonstrate that con-tinuous progress is being made, taxpayers re-lying on the physical work test must show that the project is undergoing ‘‘continuous construction,’’ and taxpayer relying on the five percent safe harbor must show ‘‘contin-uous effort’’ to complete the project.
928Col- lectively, these two tests are referred to as the ‘‘continuity requirement.’’

HOUSE BILL  The provision eliminates the inflation ad-justment for wind facilities the construction of which begins after the date of enactment. Such facilities are entitled to a credit of 1.5 cents per kilowatt-hour (i.e., the statutory credit rate unadjusted for inflation). Credits remain subject to the phase-down based on the year construction begins. The provision includes a special rule for determining the beginning of construction, which is intended to codify Treasury guid-ance for determining when construction of a facility has begun, including the physical work test, the five percent safe harbor, and the continuity requirement. Effective date.—The provision terminating the inflation adjustment is effective for tax-able years ending after the date of enact-ment. The provision codifying existing guid-ance for determining when construction has begun is effective for taxable years begin-ning before, on, or after the date of enact-ment.

Property used to generate energy for the purposes of heating a swimming pool is not eligible solar energy property. In addition to the permanent credit, tem-porary investment credits are available for a variety of renewable and alternative energy property. The rules governing these tem-porary credits are described below. The energy credit is a component of the general business credit.
931An unused general business credit generally may be carried back one year and carried forward 20 years.
932The taxpayer’s basis in the property is reduced by one-half of the amount of the credit claimed. For projects whose construc-tion time is expected to equal or exceed two years, the credit may be claimed as progress expenditures are made on the project, rather than during the year the property is placed in service. The credit is allowed against the alternative minimum tax. Solar energy property The credit rate for solar energy property is increased to 30 percent in the case of prop-erty the construction of which begins before January 1, 2020. The rate is increased to 26 percent in the case of property the construc-tion of which begins in calendar year 2020. The rate is increased to 22 percent in the case of property the construction of which begins in calendar year 2021. To qualify for the enhanced credit rates, the property must be placed in service before January 1, 2024. Additionally, equipment that uses fiber- optic distributed sunlight (‘‘fiber optic solar’’) to illuminate the inside of a struc-ture is solar energy property eligible for the 30-percent credit, but only for property placed in service before January 1, 2017. Fuel cell property and microturbine property The energy credit applies to qualified fuel cell power plant property, but only for peri-ods prior to January 1, 2017. The credit rate is 30 percent. A qualified fuel cell power plant is an inte-grated system composed of a fuel cell stack assembly and associated balance of plant components that (1) converts a fuel into elec-tricity using electrochemical means, and (2) has an electricity-only generation efficiency of greater than 30 percent and a capacity of at least one-half kilowatt. The credit may not exceed $1,500 for each 0.5 kilowatt of ca-pacity. The energy credit applies to qualifying sta-tionary microturbine power plant property for periods prior to January 1, 2017. The cred-it is limited to the lesser of 10 percent of the basis of the property or $200 for each kilo-watt of capacity. A qualified stationary microturbine power plant is an integrated system comprised of a gas turbine engine, a combustor, a recuperator or regenerator, a generator or alternator, and associated balance of plant components that converts a fuel into elec-tricity and thermal energy. Such system also includes all secondary components lo-cated between the existing infrastructure for fuel delivery and the existing infrastructure for power distribution, including equipment and controls for meeting relevant power standards, such as voltage, frequency, and power factors. Such system must have an electricity-only generation efficiency of not less than 26 percent at International Stand-ard Organization conditions and a capacity of less than 2,000 kilowatts. Geothermal heat pump property The energy credit applies to qualified geo-thermal heat pump property placed in serv-ice prior to January 1, 2017. The credit rate is 10 percent. Qualified geothermal heat pump property is equipment that uses the ground or ground water as a thermal energy source to heat a structure or as a thermal energy sink to cool a structure. Small wind property The energy credit applies to qualified small wind energy property placed in service prior to January 1, 2017. The credit rate is 30 percent. Qualified small wind energy prop-erty is property that uses a qualified wind turbine to generate electricity. A qualifying wind turbine means a wind turbine of 100 kilowatts of rated capacity or less. Combined heat and power property The energy credit applies to combined heat and power (‘‘CHP’’) property placed in serv-ice prior to January 1, 2017. The credit rate is 10 percent. CHP property is property: (1) that uses the same energy source for the simultaneous or sequential generation of electrical power, mechanical shaft power, or both, in combina-tion with the generation of steam or other forms of useful thermal energy (including heating and cooling applications); (2) that has an electrical capacity of not more than 50 megawatts or a mechanical energy capac-ity of not more than 67,000 horsepower or an equivalent combination of electrical and me-chanical energy capacities; (3) that produces at least 20 percent of its total useful energy in the form of thermal energy that is not used to produce electrical or mechanical power, and produces at least 20 percent of its total useful energy in the form of electrical or mechanical power (or a combination thereof); and (4) the energy efficiency per-centage of which exceeds 60 percent. CHP property does not include property used to transport the energy source to the gener-ating facility or to distribute energy pro-duced by the facility. The otherwise allowable credit with re-spect to CHP property is reduced to the ex-tent the property has an electrical capacity or mechanical capacity in excess of any ap-plicable limits. Property in excess of the ap-plicable limit (15 megawatts or a mechanical energy capacity of more than 20,000 horse-power or an equivalent combination of elec-trical and mechanical energy capacities) is permitted to claim a fraction of the other-wise allowable credit. The fraction is equal to the applicable limit divided by the capac-ity of the property. For example, a 45 mega-watt property would be eligible to claim 15/ 45ths, or one third, of the otherwise allow-able credit. Again, no credit is allowed if the property exceeds the 50 megawatt or 67,000 horsepower limitations described above. Additionally, systems whose fuel source is at least 90 percent open-loop biomass and that would qualify for the credit but for the failure to meet the efficiency standard are eligible for a credit that is reduced in pro-portion to the degree to which the system fails to meet the efficiency standard. For ex-ample, a system that would otherwise be re-quired to meet the 60-percent efficiency standard, but which only achieves 30-percent efficiency, would be permitted a credit equal to one-half of the otherwise allowable credit (i.e., a 5-percent credit). Election of energy credit in lieu of section 45 production tax credit A taxpayer may make an irrevocable elec-tion to have the property used in certain qualified renewable power facilities be treat-ed as energy property eligible for a 30-per-cent investment credit under section 48. For this purpose, qualified facilities are facilities otherwise eligible for the renewable elec-tricity production tax credit with respect to which no credit under section 45 has been al-lowed. A taxpayer electing to treat a facility as energy property may not claim the pro-duction credit under section 45. In the case of non-wind facilities, to make this election, construction must begin before January 1, 2017. For wind facilities, the 30-percent credit rate is reduced by 20 percent in the case of any wind facility the construction of which begins in calendar year 2017, by 40 percent in the case of any wind facility the construc-tion of which begins in calendar year 2018, and by 60 percent in the case of any wind fa-cility the construction of which begins in calendar year 2019. The credit for wind facili-ties expires for facilities the construction of which begins after calendar year 2019. In general, a taxpayer may establish the beginning of construction of a facility by be-ginning physical work of a significant nature (the ‘‘physical work test’’).
933Alternatively, a taxpayer may establish the beginning of construction by meeting the safe harbor test which generally requires that the taxpayer have paid or incurred five percent of the total cost of constructing the facility (the ‘‘five percent safe harbor’’).
934Both methods require that a taxpayer make continuous progress towards completion once construc-tion has begun.
935To demonstrate that con-tinuous progress is being made, taxpayers re-lying on the physical work test must show that the project is undergoing ‘‘continuous construction,’’ and taxpayers relying on the five percent safe harbor must show ‘‘contin-uous effort’’ to complete the project.
936Col- lectively, these two tests are referred to as the ‘‘continuity requirement.’’
937 
HOUSE BILL  The provision extends the energy credit for fiber optic solar, fuel cell, microturbine, geo-thermal heat pump, small wind, and com-bined heat and power property. In each case, the credit is extended for property the con-struction of which begins before January 1, 2022. In the case of fiber optic solar, fuel cell, and small wind property, the credit rate is reduced to 26 percent for property the con-struction of which begins in calendar year 2020 and to 22 percent for property the con-struction of which begins in calendar year 2021. Qualified property must be placed in service before January 1, 2024. The provision terminates the permanent credits for solar and geothermal property the construction of which begins after December 31, 2027. The provision includes a special rule for determining the beginning of construction, which is intended to adopt Treasury guid-ance for determining when construction of a facility has begun, including the physical work test, the five percent safe harbor, and the continuity requirement. Effective date.—The provision generally ap-plies to periods after December 31, 2016, under rules similar to the rules of section 48(m), as in effect on the day before the date of enactment of the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1990. The extension of the credit for combined heat and power system property applies to property placed in service after December 31, 2016. The reduced credit rates and the termination of the permanent cred-its are effective on the date of the enactment of the provision. The special rule for deter-mining the beginning of construction of qualified property applies to taxable years beginning before, on, or after the date of en-actment of the provision.

938Sec. 45J. The 1.8-cents credit amount is reduced, but not below zero, if the annual average contract price per kilowatt-hour of electricity generated from advanced nuclear power facilities in the pre-ceding year exceeds eight cents per kilowatt-hour. The eight-cent price comparison level is indexed for inflation after 1992 (12.6 cents for 2017). 
939I.R.S. Notice 2013–68. CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement does not follow the House bill provision. 3. Extension and phaseout of residential en-ergy efficient property credit (sec. 3503 of the House bill and sec. 25D of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  In general Section 25D provides a personal tax credit for the purchase of qualified solar electric property and qualified solar water heating property that is used exclusively for pur-poses other than heating swimming pools and hot tubs. The credit is equal to 30 per-cent of qualifying expenditures. Section 25D also provides a 30 percent cred-it for the purchase of qualified geothermal heat pump property, qualified small wind en-ergy property, and qualified fuel cell power plants. The credit for any fuel cell may not exceed $500 for each 0.5 kilowatt of capacity. The credit is nonrefundable. The credit with respect to all qualifying property may be claimed against the alternative minimum tax. With the exception of solar property, the credit expires for property placed in service after December 31, 2016. In the case of quali-fied solar electric property and solar water heating property, the credit expires for prop-erty placed in service after December 31, 2021. In addition, the credit rate for such solar property is reduced to 26 percent for property placed in service in calendar year 2020 and to 22 percent for property placed in service in calendar year 2021. Qualified property Qualified solar electric property is prop-erty that uses solar energy to generate elec-tricity for use in a dwelling unit. Qualifying solar water heating property is property used to heat water for use in a dwelling unit located in the United States and used as a residence if at least half of the energy used by such property for such purpose is derived from the sun. A qualified fuel cell power plant is an inte-grated system comprised of a fuel cell stack assembly and associated balance of plant components that (1) converts a fuel into elec-tricity using electrochemical means, (2) has an electricity-only generation efficiency of greater than 30 percent, and (3) has a name-plate capacity of at least 0.5 kilowatt. The qualified fuel cell power plant must be in-stalled on or in connection with a dwelling unit located in the United States and used by the taxpayer as a principal residence. Qualified small wind energy property is property that uses a wind turbine to gen-erate electricity for use in a dwelling unit located in the United States and used as a residence by the taxpayer. Qualified geothermal heat pump property means any equipment which (1) uses the ground or ground water as a thermal energy source to heat the dwelling unit or as a ther-mal energy sink to cool such dwelling unit, (2) meets the requirements of the Energy Star program which are in effect at the time that the expenditure for such equipment is made, and (3) is installed on or in connection with a dwelling unit located in the United States and used as a residence by the tax-payer. Additional rules The depreciable basis of the property is re-duced by the amount of the credit. Expendi-tures for labor costs allocable to onsite prep-aration, assembly, or original installation of property eligible for the credit are eligible expenditures. Special proration rules apply in the case of jointly owned property, condominiums, and tenant-stockholders in cooperative housing corporations. If less than 80 percent of the property is used for nonbusiness purposes, only that portion of expenditures that is used for nonbusiness purposes is taken into account. HOUSE BILL  The provision extends the residential en-ergy efficient property credit with respect to non-solar qualified property through Decem-ber 31, 2021. The credit rate for such property is reduced to 26 percent for property placed in service in calendar year 2020 and to 22 per-cent for property placed in service in cal-endar year 2021. Effective date.—The provision applies to property placed in service after December 31, 2016. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  No provision. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement does not follow the House bill provision. 4. Repeal of enhanced oil recovery credit (sec. 3504 of the House bill and sec. 43 of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  Section 43 provides a 15-percent credit for expenses associated with an enhanced oil re-covery (‘‘EOR’’) project. Qualified EOR costs consist of the following designated expenses associated with an EOR project: (1) amounts paid for depreciable tangible property; (2) in-tangible drilling and development expenses; (3) tertiary injectant expenses; and (4) con-struction costs for certain Alaskan natural gas treatment facilities. An EOR project is generally a project that involves increasing the amount of recoverable domestic crude oil through the use of one or more tertiary re-covery methods (as defined in section 193(b)(3)), such as injecting steam or carbon dioxide into a well to effect oil displacement. The credit is reduced as the price of oil ex-ceeds a certain threshold. 
HOUSE BILL  The provision repeals the enhanced oil re-covery credit. Effective date.—The provision applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  No provision. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement does not follow the House bill provision. 5. Repeal of credit for producing oil and gas from marginal wells (sec. 3505 of the House bill and sec. 45I of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  Section 45I provides a $3-per-barrel credit for the production of crude oil and a $0.50 credit per 1,000 cubic feet of qualified natural gas production. In both cases, the credit is available only for production from a ‘‘quali-fied marginal well.’’ A qualified marginal well is defined as a domestic well: (1) production from which is treated as marginal production for purposes of the Code’s percentage depletion rules; or (2) that during the taxable year had average daily production of not more than 25 barrel equivalents and produces water at a rate of not less than 95 percent of total well efflu-ent. The maximum amount of production on which credit could be claimed is 1,095 barrels or barrel equivalents. The credit is not available to production occurring if the reference price of oil exceeds $18 ($2.00 for natural gas). The credit is re-duced proportionately for reference prices between $15 and $18 ($1.67 and $2.00 for nat-ural gas). The credit is treated as a general business credit. Unused credits can be carried back for up to five years rather than the generally applicable carryback period of one year. The credit is indexed for inflation. HOUSE BILL  The provision repeals the credit for pro-ducing oil and gas from marginal wells. Effective date.—The provision applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  No provision. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement does not follow the House bill provision. 6. Modification of credit for production from advanced nuclear power facilities (sec. 3506 of the House bill and sec. 45J of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  Taxpayers producing electricity at a quali-fying advanced nuclear power facility may claim a credit equal to 1.8 cents per kilo-watt-hour of electricity produced for the eight-year period starting when the facility is placed in service.
938The aggregate amount of credit that a taxpayer may claim in any year during the eight-year period is subject to limitation based on allocated capacity and an annual limitation as described below. An advanced nuclear facility is any nu-clear facility for the production of elec-tricity, the reactor design for which was ap-proved after 1993 by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. For this purpose, a qualifying advanced nuclear facility does not include any facility for which a substantially similar design for a facility of comparable capacity was approved before 1994. A qualifying advanced nuclear facility is an advanced nuclear facility for which the taxpayer has received an allocation of mega-watt capacity from the Secretary of the Treasury (‘‘the Secretary’’) and is placed in service before January 1, 2021. The taxpayer may only claim credit for production of elec-tricity equal to the ratio of the allocated ca-pacity that the taxpayer receives from the Secretary to the rated nameplate capacity of the taxpayer’s facility. For example, if the taxpayer receives an allocation of 750 megawatts of capacity from the Secretary and the taxpayer’s facility has a rated name-plate capacity of 1,000 megawatts, then the taxpayer may claim three-quarters of the otherwise allowable credit, or 1.35 cents per kilowatt-hour, for each kilowatt-hour of electricity produced at the facility (subject to the annual limitation described below). The credit is restricted to 6,000 megawatts of national capacity. Once that limitation has been reached, the Secretary may make no additional allocations. Treasury guidance re-quired allocation applications to be filed be-fore February 1, 2014.
939 A taxpayer operating a qualified facility may claim no more than $125 million in tax credits per 1,000 megawatts of allocated ca-pacity in any one year of the eight-year credit period. If the taxpayer operates a 1,350 megawatt rated nameplate capacity system and has received an allocation from the Sec-retary for 1,350 megawatts of capacity eligi-ble for the credit, the taxpayer’s annual lim-itation on credits that may be claimed is equal to 1.35 times $125 million, or $168.75 million. If the taxpayer operates a facility with a nameplate rated capacity of 1,350

See section 1102 of the bill (Repeal of nonrefundable credits). megawatts, but has received an allocation from the Secretary for 750 megawatts of credit eligible capacity, then the two limita-tions apply such that the taxpayer may claim a credit effectively equal to one cent per kilowatt-hour of electricity produced (calculated as described above) subject to an annual credit limitation of $93.75 million in credits (three-quarters of $125 million). The credit is part of the general business credit. 
HOUSE BILL  The provision modifies the national mega-watt capacity limitation for the advanced nuclear power production credit. To the ex-tent any amount of the 6,000 megawatts of authorized capacity remains unutilized, the provision requires the Secretary to allocate such capacity first to facilities placed in service before the year 2021, to the extent such facilities did not receive an allocation equal to their full nameplate capacity, and then to facilities placed in service after such date in the order in which such facilities are placed in service. The provision provides that the present-law placed-in-service sunset date of January 1, 2021, does not apply with respect to allocations of such unutilized na-tional megawatt capacity. The provision also allows qualified public entities to elect to forgo credits to which they otherwise would be entitled in favor of an eligible project partner. Qualified public entities are defined as (1) a Federal, State, or local government of any political subdivi-sion, agency, or instrumentality thereof; (2) a mutual or cooperative electric company; or (3) a not-for-profit electric utility which has or had received a loan or loan guarantee under the Rural Electrification Act of 1936.
940 An eligible project partner under the provi-sion generally includes any person who de-signed or constructed the nuclear power plant, participates in the provision of nu-clear steam or nuclear fuel to the power plant, or has an ownership interest in the fa-cility. In the case of a facility owned by a partnership, where the credit is determined at the partnership level, any electing quali-fied public entity is treated as the taxpayer with respect to such entity’s distributive share of such credits, and any other partner is an eligible project partner. Effective date.—The provision requiring the allocation of unutilized national megawatt capacity limitation is effective on the date of enactment. The provision allowing an election by qualified public entities to forgo credits in favor of an eligible project partner is effective for taxable years beginning after the date of enactment. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  No provision. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement does not include in the House bill. G. Bond Reforms 1. Termination of private activity bonds (sec. 3601 of the House bill and sec. 103 of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  In general Under present law, gross income generally does not include interest paid on State or local bonds.
941State and local bonds are clas-sified generally as either governmental bonds or private activity bonds. Govern-mental bonds are bonds which are primarily used to finance governmental functions or that are repaid with governmental funds. Private activity bonds are bonds with re-spect to which the State or local government serves as a conduit providing financing to nongovernmental persons (e.g., private busi-nesses or individuals). The exclusion from in-come for State and local bonds only applies to private activity bonds if the bonds are issued for certain permitted purposes (‘‘qualified private activity bonds’’). Private activity bonds Present law provides three main tests for determining whether a State or local bond is in substance a private activity bond, the two-part private business test, the five-per-cent unrelated or disproportionate use test, and the private loan test. Private business test Private business use and private payments result in State and local bonds being private activity bonds if both parts of the two-part private business test are satisfied— 1. More than 10 percent of the bond pro-ceeds is to be used (directly or indirectly) by a private business (the ‘‘private business use test’’); and 2. More than 10 percent of the debt service on the bonds is secured by an interest in property to be used in a private business use or to be derived from payments in respect of such property (the ‘‘private payment test’’). Private business use generally includes any use by a business entity (including the Federal government), which occurs pursuant to terms not generally available to the gen-eral public. For example, if bond-financed property is leased to a private business (other than pursuant to certain short-term leases for which safe harbors are provided under Treasury regulations), bond proceeds used to finance the property are treated as used in a private business use, and rental payments are treated as securing the pay-ment of the bonds. Private business use also can arise when a governmental entity con-tracts for the operation of a governmental facility by a private business under a man-agement contract that does not satisfy Treasury regulatory safe harbors regarding the types of payments made to the private operator and the length of the contract. Five-percent unrelated or disproportionate business use test A second standard to determine whether a bond is to be treated as a private activity bond is the five percent unrelated or dis-proportionate business use test. Under this test the private business use and private payment test (described above) are sepa-rately applied substituting five percent for 10 percent and generally only taking into ac-count private business use and private pay-ments that are not related or not propor-tionate to the government use of the bond proceeds. For example, while a bond issue that finances a new State or local govern-ment office building may include a cafeteria, the issue may become a private activity bond if the size of the cafeteria is excessive (as determined under this rule). Private loan test The third standard for determining wheth-er a State or local bond is a private activity bond is whether an amount exceeding the lesser of (1) five percent of the bond proceeds or (2) $5 million is used (directly or indi-rectly) to finance loans to private persons. Private loans include both business and other (e.g., personal) uses and payments by private persons; however, in the case of busi-ness uses and payments, all private loans also constitute private business uses and payments subject to the private business test. Present law provides that the substance of a transaction governs in determining whether the transaction gives rise to a pri-vate loan. In general, any transaction which transfers tax ownership of property to a pri-vate person is treated as a private loan. Special limit on certain output facilities A special rule for output facilities treats bonds as private activity bonds if more than $15 million of the proceeds of the bond issue are used to finance an output facility (an output facility includes electric and gas gen-eration, transmission and related facilities but not a facility for the furnishing of water).942 Special volume cap requirement for larger transactions A special volume cap requirement for larg-er transactions treats bonds as private activ-ity bonds if the nonqualified amount of pri-vate business use or private payments ex-ceeds $15 million (even if that amount is within the general 10-percent private busi-ness limitation for governmental bonds) un-less the issuer obtains a private activity bond volume allocation.
943 Qualified private activity bonds As stated, interest on private activity bonds is taxable unless the bonds meet the requirements for qualified private activity bonds. Qualified private activity bonds per-mit States or local governments to act as conduits providing tax-exempt financing for certain private activities. The definition of qualified private activity bonds includes an exempt facility bond, or qualified mortgage, veterans’ mortgage, small issue, redevelop-ment, 501(c)(3), or student loan bond.
944The definition of exempt facility bond includes bonds issued to finance certain transpor-tation facilities (airports, ports, mass com-muting, and high-speed intercity rail facili-ties); qualified residential rental projects; privately owned and/or operated utility fa-cilities (sewage, water, solid waste disposal, and local district heating and cooling facili-ties, certain private electric and gas facili-ties, and hydroelectric dam enhancements); public/private educational facilities; quali-fied green building and sustainable design projects; and qualified highway or surface freight transfer facilities.
945 In most cases, the aggregate volume of these tax-exempt private activity bonds is restricted by annual aggregate volume lim-its imposed on bonds issued by issuers within each State. For 2017, the State volume limit is the greater of $100 multiplied by the State population, or $305.32 million.

948Sec. 141. 
949Sec. 149(d)(5). 
950Sec. 149(d)(3). Bonds issued before 1986 and pur-suant to certain transition rules contained in the Tax Reform Act of 1986 may be advance refunded more than one time in certain cases. 
951Sec. 149(d)(2). 
952Sec. 149(d)(3)(A)(iii) and (B); Treas. Reg. sec. 1.149(d)–1(f)(3). A ‘‘call’’ provision provides the issuer of a bond with the right to redeem the bond prior to the stated maturity. 953The authority to issue two other types of tax- credit bonds, recovery zone economic development bonds and Build America Bonds, expired on January 1, 2011. 
954Certain other rules apply to qualified tax credit bonds, such as maturity limitations, reporting re-quirements, spending rules, and rules relating to ar-bitrage. Separate rules apply in the case of tax-cred-it bonds which are not qualified tax-credit bonds (i.e., ‘‘recovery zone economic development bonds,’’ and ‘‘Build America Bonds’’). 
955However, for new clean renewable energy bonds and qualified energy conservation bonds, the appli-cable credit rate is 70 percent of the otherwise appli-cable rate. 
956Sec. 54C. 957Given the differences in credit quality and other characteristics of individual issuers, the Secretary cannot set credit rates in a manner that will allow each issuer to issue tax credit bonds at par. 
958Capital expenditures to implement green com-munity programs include grants, loans, and other repayment mechanisms to implement such pro-grams. For example, States may issue these tax credit bonds to finance retrofits of existing private buildings through loans and/or grants to individual homeowners or businesses, or through other repay-ment mechanisms. Other repayment mechanisms can include periodic fees assessed on a government bill or utility bill that approximates the energy sav-ings of energy efficiency or conservation retrofits. Retrofits can include heating, cooling, lighting, water-saving, storm water-reducing, or other effi-ciency measures. 
959Given the differences in credit quality and other characteristics of individual issuers, the Secretary cannot set credit rates in a manner that will allow each issuer to issue tax credit bonds at par. 2. Repeal of advance refunding bonds (sec. 3602 of the House bill, sec. 13532 of the Senate amendment, and sec. 149(d) of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  Section 103 generally provides that gross income does not include interest received on State or local bonds. State and local bonds are classified generally as either govern-mental bonds or private activity bonds. Gov-ernmental bonds are bonds the proceeds of which are primarily used to finance govern-mental facilities or the debt is repaid with governmental funds. Private activity bonds are bonds in which the State or local govern-ment serves as a conduit providing financing to nongovernmental persons (e.g., private businesses or individuals).
948Bonds issued to finance the activities of charitable organiza-tions described in section 501(c)(3) (‘‘qualified 501(c)(3) bonds’’) are one type of private ac-tivity bond. The exclusion from income for interest on State and local bonds only ap-plies if certain Code requirements are met. The exclusion for income for interest on State and local bonds applies to refunding bonds but there are limits on advance re-funding bonds. A refunding bond is defined as any bond used to pay principal, interest, or redemption price on a prior bond issue (the refunded bond). Different rules apply to cur-rent as opposed to advance refunding bonds. A current refunding occurs when the re-funded bond is redeemed within 90 days of issuance of the refunding bonds. Conversely, a bond is classified as an advance refunding if it is issued more than 90 days before the redemption of the refunded bond.
949Proceeds of advance refunding bonds are generally in-vested in an escrow account and held until a future date when the refunded bond may be redeemed. Although there is no statutory limitation on the number of times that tax-exempt bonds may be currently refunded, the Code limits advance refundings. Generally, gov-ernmental bonds and qualified 501(c)(3) bonds may be advance refunded one time.
950Pri- vate activity bonds, other than qualified 501(c)(3) bonds, may not be advance refunded at all.
951Furthermore, in the case of an ad-vance refunding bond that results in interest savings (e.g., a high interest rate to low in-terest rate refunding), the refunded bond must be redeemed on the first call date 90 days after the issuance of the refunding bond that results in debt service savings.
952 
HOUSE BILL  The provision repeals the exclusion from gross income for interest on a bond issued to advance refund another bond. Effective date.—The provision applies to ad-vance refunding bonds issued after December 31, 2017. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The Senate amendment follows the House bill. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the Sen-ate amendment. 3. Repeal of tax credit bonds (sec. 3603 of the House bill and secs. 54A, 54B, 54C, 54D, 54E, 54F and 6431 of the Code) PRESENT LAW  In general Tax-credit bonds provide tax credits to in-vestors to replace a prescribed portion of the interest cost. The borrowing subsidy gen-erally is measured by reference to the credit rate set by the Treasury Department. Cur-rent tax-credit bonds include qualified tax credit bonds, which have certain common general requirements, and include new clean renewable energy bonds, qualified energy conservation bonds, qualified zone academy bonds, and qualified school construction bonds.
953 Qualified tax-credit bonds General rules applicable to qualified tax-credit bonds
954 Unlike tax-exempt bonds, qualified tax- credit bonds generally are not interest-bear-ing obligations. Rather, the taxpayer holding a qualified tax-credit bond on a credit allow-ance date is entitled to a tax credit. The amount of the credit is determined by multi-plying the bond’s credit rate by the face amount on the holder’s bond. The credit rate for an issue of qualified tax credit bonds is determined by the Secretary and is esti-mated to be a rate that permits issuance of the qualified tax-credit bonds without dis-count and interest cost to the qualified issuer.
955The credit accrues quarterly and is includible in gross income (as if it were an interest payment on the bond), and can be claimed against regular income tax liability and alternative minimum tax liability. Un-used credits may be carried forward to suc-ceeding taxable years. In addition, credits may be separated from the ownership of the underlying bond similar to how interest cou-pons can be stripped for interest-bearing bonds. New clean renewable energy bonds New clean renewable energy bonds (‘‘New CREBs’’) may be issued by qualified issuers to finance qualified renewable energy facili-ties.
956Qualified renewable energy facilities are facilities that: (1) qualify for the tax credit under section 45 (other than Indian coal and refined coal production facilities), without regard to the placed-in-service date requirements of that section; and (2) are owned by a public power provider, govern-mental body, or cooperative electric com-pany. The term ‘‘qualified issuers’’ includes: (1) public power providers; (2) a governmental body; (3) cooperative electric companies; (4) a not-for-profit electric utility that has re-ceived a loan or guarantee under the Rural Electrification Act; and (5) clean renewable energy bond lenders. There was originally a national limitation for New CREBs of $800 million. The national limitation was then in-creased by an additional $1.6 billion in 2009. As with other tax credit bonds, a taxpayer holding New CREBs on a credit allowance date is entitled to a tax credit. However, the credit rate on New CREBs is set by the Sec-retary at a rate that is 70 percent of the rate that would permit issuance of such bonds without discount and interest cost to the issuer.957 Qualified energy conservation bonds Qualified energy conservation bonds may be used to finance qualified conservation purposes. The term ‘‘qualified conservation purpose’’ means: 1. Capital expenditures incurred for pur-poses of: (a) reducing energy consumption in publicly owned buildings by at least 20 per-cent; (b) implementing green community programs;
958(c) rural development involving the production of electricity from renewable energy resources; or (d) any facility eligible for the production tax credit under section 45 (other than Indian coal and refined coal pro-duction facilities); 2. Expenditures with respect to facilities or grants that support research in: (a) develop-ment of cellulosic ethanol or other nonfossil fuels; (b) technologies for the capture and se-questration of carbon dioxide produced through the use of fossil fuels; (c) increasing the efficiency of existing technologies for producing nonfossil fuels; (d) automobile battery technologies and other technologies to reduce fossil fuel consumption in trans-portation; and (e) technologies to reduce en-ergy use in buildings; 3. Mass commuting facilities and related facilities that reduce the consumption of en-ergy, including expenditures to reduce pollu-tion from vehicles used for mass commuting; 4. Demonstration projects designed to pro-mote the commercialization of: (a) green building technology; (b) conversion of agri-cultural waste for use in the production of fuel or otherwise; (c) advanced battery man-ufacturing technologies; (d) technologies to reduce peak-use of electricity; and (e) tech-nologies for the capture and sequestration of carbon dioxide emitted from combusting fos-sil fuels in order to produce electricity; and 5. Public education campaigns to promote energy efficiency (other than movies, con-certs, and other events held primarily for en-tertainment purposes). There was originally a national limitation on qualified energy conservation bonds of $800 million. The national limitation was then increased by an additional $2.4 billion in 2009. As with other qualified tax credit bonds, the taxpayer holding qualified energy conservation bonds on a credit allowance date is entitled to a tax credit. The credit rate on the bonds is set by the Secretary at a rate that is 70 percent of the rate that would permit issuance of such bonds without discount and interest cost to the issuer.
959 Qualified zone academy bonds Qualifies zone academy bonds (‘‘QZABs’’) are defined as any bond issued by a State or

A total of $400 million of QZABs has been authorized to be issued annually in calendar years 1998 through 2008. The authorization was increased to $1.4 billion for calendar year 2009, and also for calendar year 2010. For each of the calendar years 2011 through 2016, the authorization was set at $400 million. Qualified school construction bonds Qualified school construction bonds must meet three requirements: (1) 100 percent of the available project proceeds of the bond issue is used for the construction, rehabilita-tion, or repair of a public school facility or for the acquisition of land on which such a bond-financed facility is to be constructed; (2) the bonds are issued by a State or local government within which such school is lo-cated; and (3) the issuer designates such bonds as a qualified school construction bond. There is a national limitation on qualified school construction bonds of $11 billion for calendar years 2009 and 2010, and zero after 2010. If an amount allocated is unused for a calendar year, it may be carried forward to the following and subsequent calendar years. Under a separate special rule, the Secretary of the Interior may allocate $200 million of school construction bond authority for In-dian schools. Direct-pay bonds and expired tax-credit bond provisions The Code provides that an issuer may elect to issue certain tax credit bonds as ‘‘direct- pay bonds.’’ Instead of a credit to the holder, with a ‘‘direct-pay bond’’ the Federal govern-ment pays the issuer a percentage of the in-terest on the bonds. The following tax credit bonds may be issued as direct-pay bonds: new clean renewable energy bonds, qualified en-ergy conservation bonds, and qualified school construction bonds. Qualified zone academy bonds may not be issued as direct- pay using any national zone academy bond allocation for calendar years after 2011 or any carryforward of such allocations. The ability to issue Build America Bonds and Re-covery Zone bonds, which have direct-pay features, has expired. 
HOUSE BILL  The provision prospectively repeals au-thority to issue tax-credit bonds and direct- pay bonds. Effective date.—The provision applies to bonds issued after December 31, 2017. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  No provision. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the House bill. 4. No tax-exempt bonds for professional sta-diums (sec. 3604 of the House sbill and sec. 103 of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  In general Section 103 generally provides gross in-come does not include interest on State or local bonds. State and local bonds are classi-fied generally as either governmental bonds or private activity bonds. Governmental bonds are bonds the proceeds of which are primarily used to finance governmental fa-cilities or the debt is repaid with govern-mental funds. Private activity bonds are bonds in which the State or local govern-ment serves as a conduit providing financing to nongovernmental persons (e.g., private businesses or individuals). The exclusion from income for State and local bonds does not apply to private activity bonds, unless the bonds are issued for certain purposes (‘‘qualified private activity bonds’’) per-mitted by the Code and other Code require-ments are met. Private activity bond tests In general A private activity bond includes any bond that satisfies (1) the ‘‘private business test’’ (consisting of two components: a private business use test and a private security or payment test); or (2) ‘‘the private loan fi-nancing test.’’960 Two-part private business test Under the private business test, a bond is a private activity bond if it is part of an issue in which: More than 10 percent of the proceeds of the issue (including use of the bond-financed property) are to be used in the trade or busi-ness of any person other than a govern-mental unit (‘‘private business use test’’); and More than 10 percent of the payment of principal or interest on the issue is, directly or indirectly, secured by (a) property used or to be used for a private business use or (b) to be derived from payments in respect of prop-erty, or borrowed money, used or to be used for a private business use (‘‘private payment test’’).
961 A bond is not a private activity bond un-less both parts of the private business test (i.e., the private business use test and the private payment test) are met. For purposes of the private payment test, both direct and indirect payments made by any private per-son treated as using the financed property are taken into account. Payments by a per-son for the use of proceeds generally do not include payments for ordinary and necessary expenses (within the meaning of section 162) attributable to the operation and mainte-nance of financed property.
962 Private loan financing test A bond issue satisfies the private loan fi-nancing test if proceeds exceeding the lesser of $5 million or five percent of such proceeds are used directly or indirectly to finance loans to one or more nongovernmental per-sons. Types of qualified private activity bonds The interest of qualified private activity bonds is tax exempt. A qualified private ac-tivity bond is a qualified mortgage, veterans’ mortgage, small issue, student loan, redevel-opment, 501(c)(3), or exempt facility bond.
963 To qualify as an exempt facility bond, 95 per-cent of the net proceeds must be used to fi-nance: (1) airports; (2) docks and wharves; (3) mass commuting facilities; (4) high-speed intercity rail facilities; (5) facilities for the furnishing of water; (6) sewage facilities; (7) solid waste disposal facilities; (8) hazardous waste disposal facilities; (9) qualified resi-dential rental projects; (10) facilities for the local furnishing of electric energy or gas; (11) local district heating or cooling facilities; (12) environmental enhancements of hydro-electric generating facilities; (13) qualified public educational facilities; or (14) qualified green building and sustainable design projects. Financing of sports facilities with govern-mental bonds In 1986, Congress eliminated a provision ex-pressly allowing tax-exempt financing for sports facilities.964Nevertheless, professional sports facilities continue to be financed with tax-exempt bonds despite the fact that pri-vately owned sports teams are the primary (if not exclusive) users of such facilities. Present law permits the use of tax-exempt bond proceeds for private activities if either part of the two-part private business test is not met. Only if both parts of the private business test (private use and private pay-ment) are met will the interest on such bonds be taxable. In the case of bond-fi-nanced professional sports facilities, issuers have intentionally structured the tax-ex-empt bond issuance and related transactions to fail the private payment test. In most of these transactions, the professional sports team is not required to pay for more than a small portion of its use of the sports facility. As a result, the private payment test is not met and the bonds financing the facility are not treated as private activity bonds, despite the existence of substantial private business use. 
HOUSE BILL  The provision provides that the interest on bonds, the proceeds of which are to be used to finance or refinance capital expenditures allocable to a professional sports stadium, is not tax-exempt. The term ‘‘professional sports stadium’’ means any facility (or ap-purtenant real property) which during at least five days during any calendar year is used as a stadium or arena for professional sports, exhibitions, games, or training. Effective date.—The provision applies to bonds issued after November 2, 2017. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  No provision. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement does not follow the House bill provision. H. Insurance 1. Net operating losses of life insurance com-panies (sec. 3701 of the House bill, sec. 13511 of the Senate amendment, and sec. 810 of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  A net operating loss (‘‘NOL’’) generally means the amount by which a taxpayer’s business deductions exceed its gross income. In general, an NOL may be carried back two years and carried over 20 years to offset tax-able income in such years. NOLs offset tax-able income in the order of the taxable years to which the NOL may be carried.
965 For purposes of computing the alternative minimum tax (‘‘AMT’’), a taxpayer’s NOL deduction cannot reduce the taxpayer’s al-ternative minimum taxable income (‘‘AMTI’’) by more than 90 percent of the AMTI.
966 In the case of a life insurance company, a deduction is allowed in the taxable year for operations loss carryovers and carrybacks, in lieu of the deduction for net operation losses allowed to other corporations.
967A life insurance company is permitted to treat a loss from operations (as defined under sec-tion 810(c)) for any taxable year as an oper-ations loss carryback to each of the three

PRESENT LAW  The small life insurance company deduc-tion for any taxable year is 60 percent of so much of the tentative life insurance com-pany taxable income (‘‘LICTI’’) for such tax-able year as does not exceed $3 million, re-duced by 15 percent of the excess of tentative LICTI over $3 million. The maximum deduc-tion that can be claimed by a small company is $1.8 million, and a company with a ten-tative LICTI of $15 million or more is not en-titled to any small company deduction. A small life insurance company for this pur-pose is one with less than $500 million of as-sets. 
HOUSE BILL  The provision repeals the small life insur-ance company deduction. Effective date.—The provision applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The Senate amendment is the same as the House bill.

PRESENT LAW  Tax on life insurance company taxable in-come In the case of a life insurance company, in-come tax is imposed on life insurance com-pany taxable income at the rate applicable to taxable income of a corporation. 
HOUSE BILL  The provision imposes an additional eight- percent income tax on life insurance com-pany taxable income. Effective date.—The provision applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  No provision. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement does not follow the House bill provision. 4. Adjustment for change in computing re-serves (sec. 3704 of the House bill, sec. 13513 of the Senate amendment, and sec. 807 of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  Change in method of accounting In general, a taxpayer may change its method of accounting under section 446 with the consent of the Secretary (or may be re-quired to change its method of accounting by the Secretary). In such instances, a taxpayer generally is required to make an adjustment (a ‘‘section 481(a) adjustment’’) to prevent amounts from being duplicated in, or omit-ted from, the calculation of the taxpayer’s income. Pursuant to IRS procedures, nega-tive section 481(a) adjustments generally are deducted from income in the year of the change whereas positive section 481(a) ad-justments generally are required to be in-cluded in income ratably over four taxable years.969 However, section 807(f) explicitly provides that changes in the basis for determining life insurance company reserves are to be taken into account ratably over 10 years. 10-year spread for change in computing life insurance company reserves For Federal income tax purposes, a life in-surance company includes in gross income any net decrease in reserves, and deducts a net increase in reserves.
970Methods for de-termining reserves for tax purposes gen-erally are based on reserves prescribed by the National Association of Insurance Com-missioners for purposes of financial report-ing under State regulatory rules. Income or loss resulting from a change in the method of computing reserves is taken into account ratably over a 10-year period.
971 The rule for a change in basis in computing reserves applies only if there is a change in basis in computing the Federally prescribed reserve (as distinguished from the net sur-render value). Although life insurance tax re-serves require the use of a Federally pre-scribed method, interest rate, and mortality or morbidity table, changes in other assump-tions for computing statutory reserves (e.g., when premiums are collected and claims are paid) may cause increases or decreases in a company’s life insurance reserves that must be spread over a 10-year period. Changes in the net surrender value of a contract are not subject to the 10-year spread because, apart from its use as a minimum in determining the amount of life insurance tax reserves, the net surrender value is not a reserve but a current liability. If for any taxable year the taxpayer is not a life insurance company, the balance of any adjustments to reserves is taken into ac-count for the preceding taxable year. 
HOUSE BILL  Income or loss resulting from a change in method of computing life insurance company reserves is taken into account consistent with IRS procedures, generally ratably over a four-year period, instead of over a 10-year period. Effective date.—The provision applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The Senate amendment is the same as the House bill. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the House bill and the Senate amendment. 5. Repeal of special rule for distributions to shareholders from pre-1984 policyholders surplus account (sec. 3705 of the House bill, sec. 13514 of the Senate amendment, and sec. 815 of the Code) 
PRESENT AND PRIOR LAW  Under the law in effect from 1959 through 1983, a life insurance company was subject to a three-phase taxable income computation under Federal tax law. Under the three-phase system, a company was taxed on the lesser of its gain from operations or its taxable in-vestment income (Phase I) and, if its gain from operations exceeded its taxable invest-ment income, 50 percent of such excess (Phase II). Federal income tax on the other 50 percent of the gain from operations was deferred, and was accounted for as part of a policyholder’s surplus account and, subject to certain limitations, taxed only when dis-tributed to stockholders or upon corporate dissolution (Phase III). To determine wheth-er amounts had been distributed, a company maintained a shareholders surplus account, which generally included the company’s pre-viously taxed income that would be available for distribution to shareholders. Distribu-tions to shareholders were treated as being first out of the shareholders surplus account, then out of the policyholders surplus ac-count, and finally out of other accounts. The Deficit Reduction Act of 1984972in- cluded provisions that, for 1984 and later years, eliminated further deferral of tax on amounts (described above) that previously would have been deferred under the three- phase system. Although for taxable years after 1983, life insurance companies may not enlarge their policyholders surplus account, the companies are not taxed on previously deferred amounts unless the amounts are treated as distributed to shareholders or sub-tracted from the policyholders surplus ac-count.
973 Any direct or indirect distribution to shareholders from an existing policyholders surplus account of a stock life insurance company is subject to tax at the corporate rate in the taxable year of the distribution. Present law (like prior law) provides that any distribution to shareholders is treated as made (1) first out of the shareholders surplus account, to the extent thereof, (2) then out of the policyholders surplus account, to the extent thereof, and (3) finally, out of other accounts. For taxable years beginning after Decem-ber 31, 2004, and before January 1, 2007, the application of the rules imposing income tax on distributions to shareholders from the policyholders surplus account of a life insur-ance company were suspended. Distributions in those years were treated as first made out of the policyholders surplus account, to the extent thereof, and then out of the share-holders surplus account, and lastly out of other accounts. 
HOUSE BILL  The provision repeals section 815, the rules imposing income tax on distributions to shareholders from the policyholders surplus account of a stock life insurance company. In the case of any stock life insurance company with an existing policyholders sur-plus account (as defined in section 815 before its repeal), tax is imposed on the balance of the account as of December 31, 2017. A life in-surance company is required to pay tax on the balance of the account ratably over the first eight taxable years beginning after De-cember 31, 2017. Specifically, the tax imposed on a life insurance company is the tax on the sum of life insurance company taxable in-come for the taxable year (but not less than zero) plus 1/8 of the balance of the existing policyholders surplus account as of Decem-ber 31, 2017. Thus, life insurance company losses are not allowed to offset the amount of the policyholders surplus account balance subject to tax. Effective date.—The provision applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The Senate amendment is the same as the House bill.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH10070 December 15, 2017 
974Sec. 832(b)(5). 
975See Part II.A.1 (Reduction in corporate tax rate). 
976Sec. 831(a). 977Sec. 832. 
978The most recent property and casualty reserve discount factors published by Treasury are in Rev. Proc. 2016–58, 2016–51 I.R.B. 839, and see Rev. Proc. 2012–44, 2012–49 I.R.B. 645. 
979This rule adopts the definition found in section 430(h)(2)(D)(i) of the term ‘‘corporate bond yield curve.’’ Section 430, which relates to minimum fund-ing standards for single-employer defined benefit pension plans, includes other rules for determining an ‘‘effective interest rate,’’ such as segment rate rules. The term ‘‘effective interest rate’’ along with these other rules, including the segment rate rules, do not apply for purposes of property and casualty insurance reserve discounting. CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the House bill and the Senate amendment. 6. Modification of proration rules for prop-erty and casualty insurance companies (sec. 3706 of the House bill, sec. 13515 of the Senate amendment, and sec. 832 of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  The taxable income of a property and cas-ualty insurance company is determined as the sum of its gross income from under-writing income and investment income (as well as gains and other income items), re-duced by allowable deductions. A proration rule applies to property and casualty insurance companies. In calculating the deductible amount of its reserve for losses incurred, a property and casualty in-surance company must reduce the amount of losses incurred by 15 percent of (1) the insur-er’s tax-exempt interest, (2) the deductible portion of dividends received (with special rules for dividends from affiliates), and (3) the increase for the taxable year in the cash value of life insurance, endowment, or annu-ity contracts the company owns.
974This pro- ration rule reflects the fact that reserves are generally funded in part from tax-exempt in-terest, from deductible dividends, and from other untaxed amounts. 
HOUSE BILL  The provision replaces the 15-percent re-duction under present law with a 26.25-per-cent reduction under the proration rule for property and casualty insurance companies. This change in the percentage takes into ac-count the reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35 to 20 percent under section 3001 of the bill (reduction in corporate tax rate). Effective date.—The provision applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The provision replaces the 15-percent re-duction under present law with a reduction equal to 5.25 percent divided by the top cor-porate tax rate. For 2018, the top corporate tax rate is 35 percent, and the percentage re-duction is 15 percent. For 2019 and there-after, the corporate tax rate is 20 percent, and the percentage reduction is 26.25 percent under the proration rule for property and casualty insurance companies. The proration percentage will be automatically adjusted in the future if the top corporate tax rate is changed, so that the product of the proration percentage and the top corporate tax rate al-ways equals 5.25 percent. Effective date.—The provision applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the Sen-ate amendment. The top corporate tax rate is 21 percent for 2018 and thereafter,
975so the percentage reduction is 25 percent under the proration rule for property and casualty in-surance companies. 7. Modification of discounting rules for prop-erty and casualty insurance companies (sec. 3707 of the House bill and sec. 832 of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  A property and casualty insurance com-pany generally is subject to tax on its tax-able income.
976The taxable income of a prop-erty and casualty insurance company is de-termined as the sum of its underwriting in-come and investment income (as well as gains and other income items), reduced by allowable deductions.977Among the items that are deductible in calculating under-writing income are additions to reserves for losses incurred and expenses incurred. To take account of the time value of money, discounting of unpaid losses is re-quired. All property and casualty loss re-serves (unpaid losses and unpaid loss adjust-ment expenses) for each line of business (as shown on the annual statement) are required to be discounted for Federal income tax pur-poses. The discounted reserves are calculated using a prescribed interest rate which is based on the applicable Federal mid-term rate (‘‘mid-term AFR’’). The discount rate is the average of the mid-term AFRs effective at the beginning of each month over the 60- month period preceding the calendar year for which the determination is made. To determine the period over which the re-serves are discounted, a prescribed loss pay-ment pattern applies. The prescribed length of time is either the accident year and the following three calendar years, or the acci-dent year and the following 10 calendar years, depending on the line of business. In the case of certain ‘‘long-tail’’ lines of busi-ness, the 10-year period is extended, but not by more than five additional years. Thus, present law limits the maximum duration of any loss payment pattern to the accident year and the following 15 years. The Treas-ury Department is directed to determine a loss payment pattern for each line of busi-ness by reference to the historical loss pay-ment pattern for that line of business using aggregate experience reported on the annual statements of insurance companies, and is required to make this determination every five years, starting with 1987. Under the discounting rules, an election is provided permitting a taxpayer to use its own (rather than an industry-wide) histor-ical loss payment pattern with respect to all lines of business, provided that applicable re-quirements are met. Treasury publishes discount factors for each line of business to be applied by tax-payers for discounting reserves.
978The dis- count factors are published annually, based on (1) the interest rate applicable to the cal-endar year, and (2) the loss payment pattern for each line of business as determined every five years. 
HOUSE BILL  The provision modifies the reserve dis-counting rules applicable to property and casualty insurance companies. In general, the provision modifies the prescribed inter-est rate, extends the periods applicable under the loss payment pattern, and repeals the election to use a taxpayer’s historical loss payment pattern. Interest rate The provision provides that the interest rate is an annual rate for any calendar year to be determined by Treasury based on the corporate bond yield curve (rather than the mid-term AFR as under present law). For this purpose, the corporate bond yield curve means, with respect to any month, a yield curve that reflects the average, for the pre-ceding 24-month period, of monthly yields on investment grade corporate bonds with vary-ing maturities and that are in the top three quality levels available.
979Because the cor-porate bond yield curve provides for 24- month averaging, the present-law rule pro-viding for 60-month averaging to determine the interest rate is repealed under the provi-sion. It is expected that Treasury will deter-mine a 24-month average for the 24 months preceding the first month of the calendar year for which the determination is made. Loss payment patterns The provision extends the periods applica-ble for determining loss payment patterns. Under the provision, the maximum duration of the loss payment pattern is determined by the amount of losses remaining unpaid using aggregate industry experience for each line of business, rather than by a set number of years as under present law. Like present law, the provision provides that Treasury determines a loss payment pattern for each line of business by reference to the historical loss payment pattern for that line of business using aggregate experi-ence reported on the annual statements of insurance companies, and is required to make this determination every five years. Under the provision, the present-law three- year and 10-year periods following the acci-dent year are extended up to a maximum of 15 more years for the lines of business to which each period applies. For lines of busi-ness to which the three-year period applies, the amount of losses that would have been treated as paid in the third year after the ac-cident year is treated as paid in that year and each subsequent year in an amount equal to the average of the amounts treated as paid in the first and second years (or, if less, the remaining amount). To the extent these unpaid losses have not been treated as paid before the 18th year after the accident year, they are treated as paid in that 18th year. Similarly, for lines of business to which the 10-year period applies, the amount of losses that would have been treated as paid in the 10th year following the accident year is treated as paid in that year and each sub-sequent year in an amount equal to the aver-age of the amounts treated as paid in the seventh, eighth, and ninth years (or if less, the remaining amount). To the extent these unpaid losses have not been treated as paid before the 25th year after the accident year, they are treated as paid in that 25th year. The provision repeals the present-law rule providing that in the case of certain ‘‘long- tail’’ lines of business, the 10-year period is extended, but not by more than five addi-tional years. The provision does not change the lines of business to which the three-year, and 10-year, periods, respectively, apply. Election to use own historical loss payment pattern The provision repeals the present-law elec-tion permitting a taxpayer to use its own (rather than an aggregate industry-experi-ence-based) historical loss payment pattern with respect to all lines of business. Effective date.—The provision generally ap-plies to taxable years beginning after De-cember 31, 2017. Under a transitional rule for the first taxable year beginning in 2018, the amount of unpaid losses and expenses unpaid (under section 832(b)(5)(B) and (6)) and the unpaid losses (under sections 807(c)(2) and 805(a)(1)) at the end of the preceding taxable year are determined as if the provision had applied to these items in such preceding tax-able year, using the interest rate and loss

Any adjustment is spread over eight taxable years, i.e., is in- cluded in the taxpayer’s gross income rat-ably in the first taxable year beginning in 2018 and the seven succeeding taxable years. For taxable years subsequent to the first taxable year beginning in 2018, the provision applies to such unpaid losses and expenses unpaid (i.e., unpaid losses and expenses un-paid at the end of the taxable year preceding the first taxable year beginning in 2018) by using the interest rate and loss payment pat-terns applicable to accident years ending with calendar year 2018. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  No provision. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the House bill with modifications. The corporate bond yield curve means, with respect to any month, a yield curve that reflects the aver-age, for the preceding 60-month period (not 24-month period), of monthly yields on in-vestment grade corporate bonds with vary-ing maturities and that are in the top three quality levels available. The present-law three-year period for discounting certain lines of business other than long-tail lines of business is not modified under the con-ference agreement. The present-law 10-year period for certain long tail lines of business is extended for a maximum of 14 more years (instead of 15 more years as under the House bill). The present-law election permitting a taxpayer to use its own (rather than an ag-gregate industry-experience-based) historical loss payment pattern is repealed. Effective date.—The provision generally ap-plies to taxable years beginning after De-cember 31, 2017. Under a transitional rule for the first taxable year beginning in 2018, the amount of unpaid losses and expenses unpaid (under section 832(b)(5)(B) and (6)) and the unpaid losses (under sections 807(c)(2) and 805(a)(1)) at the end of the preceding taxable year are determined as if the provision had applied to these items in such preceding tax-able year, using the interest rate and loss payment patterns for accident years ending with calendar year 2018. Any adjustment is spread over eight taxable years, i.e., is in-cluded in the taxpayer’s gross income rat-ably in the first taxable year beginning in 2018 and the seven succeeding taxable years. For taxable years subsequent to the first taxable year beginning in 2018, the provision applies to such unpaid losses and expenses unpaid (i.e., unpaid losses and expenses un-paid at the end of the taxable year preceding the first taxable year beginning in 2018) by using the interest rate and loss payment pat-terns applicable to accident years ending with calendar year 2018. 8. Repeal of special estimated tax payments (sec. 3708 of the House bill, sec. 13516 of the Senate amendment, and sec. 847 of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  Allowance of additional deduction and estab-lishment of special loss discount account Present law allows an insurance company required to discount its reserves an addi-tional deduction that is not to exceed the ex-cess of (1) the amount of the undiscounted unpaid losses over (2) the amount of the re-lated discounted unpaid losses, to the extent the amount was not deducted in a preceding taxable year.
980The provision imposes the requirement that a special loss discount ac-count be established and maintained, and that special estimated tax payments be made. Unused amounts of special estimated tax payments are treated as a section 6655 estimated tax payment for the 16th year after the year for which the special esti-mated tax payment was made. The total payments by a taxpayer, includ-ing section 6655 estimated tax payments and other tax payments, together with special estimated tax payments made under this provision, are generally the same as the total tax payments that the taxpayer would make if the taxpayer did not elect to have this provision apply, except to the extent amounts can be refunded under the provision in the 16th year. Calculation of special estimated tax payments based on tax benefit attributable to deduc-tion More specifically, present law imposes a requirement that the taxpayer make special estimated tax payments in an amount equal to the tax benefit attributable to the addi-tional deduction allowed under the provi-sion. If amounts are included in gross income as a result of a reduction in the taxpayer’s special loss discount account or the liquida-tion or termination of the taxpayer’s insur-ance business, and an additional tax is due for any year as a result of the inclusion, then an amount of the special estimated tax pay-ments equal to such additional tax is applied against such additional tax. If there is an ad-justment reducing the amount of additional tax against which the special estimated tax payment was applied, then in lieu of any credit or refund for the reduction, a special estimated tax payment is treated as made in an amount equal to the amount that would otherwise be allowable as a credit or refund. The amount of the tax benefit attributable to the deduction is to be determined (under Treasury regulations (which have not been promulgated)) by taking into account tax benefits that would arise from the carryback of any net operating loss for the year as well as current year benefits. In addition, tax benefits for the current and carryback years are to take into account the benefit of filing a consolidated return with another insurance company without regard to the consolidation limitations imposed by section 1503(c). The taxpayer’s estimated tax payments under section 6655 are to be determined with-out regard to the additional deduction al-lowed under this provision and the special estimated tax payments. Legislative his-tory981indicates that it is intended that the taxpayer may apply the amount of an over-payment of any section 6655 estimated tax payments for the taxable year against the amount of the special estimated tax pay-ment required under this provision. The spe-cial estimated tax payments under this pro-vision are not treated as estimated tax pay-ments for purposes of section 6655 (e.g., for purposes of calculating penalties or interest on underpayments of estimated tax) when such special estimated tax payments are made. Refundable amount To the extent that a special estimated tax payment is not used to offset additional tax due for any of the first 15 taxable years be-ginning after the year for which the payment was made, such special estimated tax pay-ment is treated as an estimated tax payment made under section 6655 for the 16th year after the year for which the special esti-mated tax payment was made. If the amount of such deemed section 6655 payment, to-gether with the taxpayer’s other payments credited against tax liability for such 16th year, exceeds the tax liability for such year, then the excess (up to the amount of the deemed section 6655 payment) may be re-funded to the taxpayer to the same extent provided under present law with respect to overpayments of tax. Regulatory authority In addition to the regulatory authority to adjust the amount of special estimated tax payments in the event of a change in the cor-porate tax rate, authority is provided to Treasury to prescribe regulations necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of the provision. Such regulations include those providing for the separate application of the provision with respect to each accident year. Separate application of the provision with respect to each accident year (i.e., applying a vintaging methodology) may be appropriate under reg-ulations to determine the amount of tax li-ability for any taxable year against which special estimated tax payments are applied, and to determine the amount (if any) of spe-cial estimated tax payments remaining after the 15th year which may be available to be refunded to the taxpayer. Regulatory authority is also provided to make such adjustments in the application of the provision as may be necessary to take into account the corporate alternative min-imum tax. Under this regulatory authority, rules similar to those applicable in the case of a change in the corporate tax rate are in-tended to apply to determine the amount of special estimated tax payments that may be applied against tax calculated at the cor-porate alternative minimum tax rate. The special estimated tax payments are not treated as payments of regular tax for pur-poses of determining the taxpayer’s alter-native minimum tax liability. Regulations have not been promulgated under section 847. HOUSE BILL  The provision repeals section 847. Thus, the election to apply section 847, the additional deduction, special loss discount account, spe-cial estimated tax payment, and refundable amount rules of present law are eliminated. The entire balance of an existing account is included in income of the taxpayer for the first taxable year beginning after 2017, and the entire amount of existing special esti-mated tax payments are applied against the amount of additional tax attributable to this inclusion. Any special estimated tax pay-ments in excess of this amount are treated as estimated tax payments under section 6655. Effective date.—The provision applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The Senate amendment is the same as the House bill. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the House bill and the Senate amendment. 9. Computation of life insurance tax reserves (sec. 13517 of the Senate amendment and sec. 807 of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  In general In determining life insurance company taxable income, a life insurance company in-cludes in gross income any net decrease in reserves, and deducts a net increase in re-serves.
982Methods for determining reserves for tax purposes generally are based on re-serves prescribed by the National Associa-tion of Insurance Commissioners for pur-poses of financial reporting under State reg-ulatory rules. In computing the net increase or net de-crease in reserves, six items are taken into

983Secs. 807(a)(2)(B) and (b)(1)(B). 
984Secs. 805(a)(4), 812. account. These are (1) life insurance re-serves; (2) unearned premiums and unpaid losses included in total reserves; (3) amounts that are discounted at interest to satisfy ob-ligations under insurance and annuity con-tracts that do not involve life, accident, or health contingencies when the computation is made; (4) dividend accumulations and other amounts held at interest in connection with insurance and annuity contracts; (5) premiums received in advance and liabilities for premium deposit funds; and (6) reason-able special contingency reserves under con-tracts of group term life insurance or group accident and health insurance that are held for retired lives, premium stabilization, or a combination of both. Life insurance reserves for any contract are the greater of the net surrender value of the contract or the reserves determined under Federally prescribed rules, but may not exceed the statutory reserve with re-spect to the contract (for regulatory report-ing). In computing the Federally prescribed reserve for any type of contract, the tax-payer must use the tax reserve method appli-cable to the contract, an interest rate for discounting of reserves to take account of the time value of money, and the prevailing commissioners’ standard tables for mortality or morbidity. Interest rate The assumed interest rate to be used in computing the Federally prescribed reserve is the greater of the applicable Federal inter-est rate or the prevailing State assumed in-terest rate. The applicable Federal interest rate is the annual rate determined by the Secretary under the discounting rules for property and casualty reserves for the cal-endar year in which the contract is issued. The prevailing State assumed interest rate is generally the highest assumed interest rate permitted to be used in at least 26 States in computing life insurance reserves for insur-ance or annuity contracts of that type as of the beginning the calendar year in which the contract is issued. In determining the high-est assumed rates permitted in at least 26 States, each State is treated as permitting the use of every rate below its highest rate. A one-time election is permitted (rev-ocable only with the consent of the Sec-retary) to apply an updated applicable Fed-eral interest rate every five years in calcu-lating life insurance reserves. The election is provided to take account of the fluctuations in market rates of return that companies ex-perience with respect to life insurance con-tracts of long duration. The use of the up-dated applicable Federal interest rate under the election does not cause the recalculation of life insurance reserves for any prior year. Under the election no change is made to the interest rate used in determining life insur-ance reserves if the updated applicable Fed-eral interest rate is less than one-half of one percentage point different from the rate used by the company in calculating life insurance reserves during the preceding five years. 
HOUSE BILL  No provision. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The provision provides that for purposes of determining the deduction for increases in certain reserves of a life insurance company, the amount of the life insurance reserves for any contract (other than certain variable contracts) is the greater of (1) the net sur-render value of the contract (if any), or (2) 92.87 percent of the amount determined using the tax reserve method otherwise applicable to the contract as of the date the reserve is determined. In the case of a variable con-tract, the amount of life insurance reserves for the contract is the sum of (1) the greater of (a) the net surrender value of the con-tract, or (b) the separate-account reserve amount under section 817 for the contract, plus (2) 92.87 percent of the excess (if any) of the amount determined using the tax reserve method otherwise applicable to the contract as of the date the reserve is determined over the amount determined in (1). In no event shall the reserves exceed the amount which would be taken into account in determining statutory reserves. No amount or item shall be taken into account more than once in de-termining any reserve. As under present law, no deduction for asset adequacy or defi-ciency reserves is allowed. The amount of life insurance reserves may not exceed the annual statement reserves. The provision provides reserve rules for supplemental bene-fits and retains present-law rules regarding certain contracts issued by foreign branches of domestic life insurance companies. Effective date.—The proposal applies to tax-able years beginning after December 31, 2017. For the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017, the difference in the amount of the reserve with respect to any contract at the end of the preceding taxable year and the amount of such reserve deter-mined as if the proposal had applied for that year is taken into account for each of the eight taxable years following that preceding year, one-eighth per year. CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the Sen-ate amendment except that, instead of 92.87 percent, the percentage relating to the stat-utory reserve is 92.81 percent. More specifi-cally, the provision provides that for pur-poses of determining the deduction for in-creases in certain reserves of a life insurance company, the amount of the life insurance reserves for any contract (other than certain variable contracts) is the greater of (1) the net surrender value of the contract (if any), or (2) 92.81 percent of the amount determined using the tax reserve method otherwise ap-plicable to the contract as of the date the re-serve is determined. In the case of a variable contract, the amount of life insurance re-serves for the contract is the sum of (1) the greater of (a) the net surrender value of the contract, or (b) the separate-account reserve amount under section 817 for the contract, plus (2) 92.81 percent of the excess (if any) of the amount determined using the tax reserve method otherwise applicable to the contract as of the date the reserve is determined over the amount determined in (1). In no event shall the reserves exceed the amount which would be taken into account in determining statutory reserves. As under present law, no deduction for asset adequacy or deficiency reserves is allowed. The amount of life insurance reserves may not exceed the annual statement reserves. A no-double-counting rule provides that no amount or item is taken into account more than once in determining any reserve under subchapter L of the Code. For example, an amount taken into account in determining a loss reserve under section 807 may not be taken into account again in determining a loss reserve under section 832. Similarly, a loss reserve determined under the tax re-serve method (whether the Commissioners Reserve Valuation Method, the Commis-sioner’s Annuity Reserve Valuation Method, a principles-based reserve method, or an-other method developed in the future, that is prescribed for a type of contract by the Na-tional Association of Insurance Commis-sioners) may not again be taken into ac-count in determining the portion of the re-serve that is separately accounted for under section 817 or be included also in deter-mining the net surrender value of a contract. The provision provides reserve rules for supplemental benefits and retains present- law rules regarding certain contracts issued by foreign branches of domestic life insur-ance companies. The provision requires the Secretary to provide for reporting (at such time and in such manner as the Secretary shall prescribe) with respect to the opening balance and closing balance or reserves and with respect to the method of computing re-serves for purposes of determining income. For this purpose, the Secretary may require that a life insurance company (including an affiliated group filing a consolidated return that includes a life insurance company) is re-quired to report each of the line item ele-ments of each separate account by com-bining them with each such item from all other separate accounts and the general ac-count, and to report the combined amounts on a line-by-line basis on the taxpayer’s re-turn. Similarly, the Secretary may in such guidance provide that reporting on a sepa-rate account by separate account basis is generally not permitted. Under existing reg-ulatory authority, if the Secretary deter-mines it is necessary in order to carry out and enforce this provision, the Secretary may require e-filing or comparable filing of the return on magnetic medial or other ma-chine readable form, and may require that the taxpayer provide its annual statement via a link, electronic copy, or other similar means. Effective date.—The provision applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. For the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017, the difference in the amount of the reserve with respect to any contract at the end of the preceding taxable year and the amount of such reserve deter-mined as if the proposal had applied for that year is taken into account for each of the eight taxable years following that preceding year, one-eighth per year. 10. Modification of rules for life insurance proration for purposes of determining the dividends received deduction (sec. 13518 of the Senate amendment and sec. 812 of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  Reduction of reserve deduction and dividends received deduction to reflect untaxed in-come A life insurance company is subject to pro-ration rules in calculating life insurance company taxable income. The proration rules reduce the company’s deductions, including reserve deductions and dividends received deductions, if the life in-surance company has tax-exempt income, de-ductible dividends received, or other similar untaxed income items, because deductible reserve increases can be viewed as being funded proportionately out of taxable and tax-exempt income. Under the proration rules, the net increase and net decrease in reserves are computed by reducing the ending balance of the reserve items by the policyholders’ share of tax-ex-empt interest.
983 Similarly, under the proration rules, a life insurance company is allowed a dividends-re-ceived deduction for intercorporate divi-dends from nonaffiliates only in proportion to the company’s share of such dividends,
984 but not for the policyholders’ share. Fully deductible dividends from affiliates are ex-cluded from the application of this proration formula, if such dividends are not themselves distributions from tax-exempt interest or from dividend income that would not be fully deductible if received directly by the tax-payer. In addition, the proration rule in-cludes in prorated amounts the increase for the taxable year in policy cash values of life

Company’s share and policyholder’s share The life insurance company proration rules provide that the company’s share, for this purpose, means the percentage obtained by dividing the company’s share of the net in-vestment income for the taxable year by the net investment income for the taxable year.
985Net investment income means 95 per-cent of gross investment income, in the case of assets held in segregated asset accounts under variable contracts, and 90 percent of gross investment income in other cases.
986 Gross investment income includes speci-fied items.
987The specified items include in-terest (including tax-exempt interest), divi-dends, rents, royalties and other related specified items, short-term capital gains, and trade or business income. Gross invest-ment income does not include gain (other than short-term capital gain to the extent it exceeds net long-term capital loss) that is, or is considered as, from the sale or exchange of a capital asset. Gross investment income also does not include the appreciation in the value of assets that is taken into account in computing the company’s tax reserve deduc-tion under section 817. The company’s share of net investment in-come, for purposes of this calculation, is the net investment income for the taxable year, reduced by the sum of (a) the policy interest for the taxable year and (b) a portion of pol-icyholder dividends.
988Policy interest is de-fined to include required interest at the greater of the prevailing State assumed rate or the applicable Federal rate (plus some other interest items). Present law provides that in any case where neither the prevailing State assumed interest rate nor the applica-ble Federal rate is used, ‘‘another appro-priate rate’’ is used for this calculation. No statutory definition of ‘‘another appropriate rate’’ is provided; the law is unclear as to what rate or rates are appropriate for this purpose.
989 In 2007, the IRS issued Rev. Rul. 2007–54,
990 interpreting required interest under section 812(b) to be calculated by multiplying the mean of a contract’s beginning-of-year and end-of-year reserves by the greater of the ap-plicable Federal interest rate or the pre-vailing State assumed interest rate, for pur-poses of determining separate account re-serves for variable contracts. However, Rev. Rul. 2007–54 was suspended by Rev. Rul. 2007– 61, in which the IRS and the Treasury De-partment stated that the issues would more appropriately be addressed by regulation.
991 No regulations have been issued to date. General account and separate accounts A variable contract is generally a life in-surance (or annuity) contract whose death benefit (or annuity payout) depends explic-itly on the investment return and market value of underlying assets.992The investment risk is generally that of the policyholder, not the insurer. The assets underlying vari-able contracts are maintained in separate accounts held by life insurers. These sepa-rate accounts are distinct from the insurer’s general account in which it maintains assets supporting products other than variable con-tracts. Reserves For Federal income tax purposes, a life in-surance company includes in gross income any net decrease in reserves, and deducts a net increase in reserves.
993Methods for de-termining reserves for tax purposes gen-erally are based on reserves prescribed by the National Association of Insurance Com-missioners for purposes of financial report-ing under State regulatory rules. For purposes of determining the amount of the tax reserves for variable contracts, how-ever, a special rule eliminates gains and losses. Under this rule,
994in determining re-serves for variable contracts, realized and unrealized gains are subtracted, and realized and unrealized losses are added, whether or not the assets have been disposed of. The basis of assets in the separate account is in-creased to reflect appreciation, and reduced to reflect depreciation in value, that are taken into account in computing reserves for such contracts. Dividends received deduction A corporate taxpayer may partially or fully deduct dividends received.
995The per- centage of the allowable dividends received deduction depends on the percentage of the stock of the distributing corporation that the recipient corporation owns. Limitation on dividends received deduction under section 246(c)(4) The dividends received deduction is not al-lowed with respect to stock either (1) held for 45 days or less during a 91-day period be-ginning 45 days before the ex-dividend date, or (2) to the extent the taxpayer is under an obligation to make related payments with respect to positions in substantially similar or related property.
996The taxpayer’s hold-ing period is reduced for periods during which its risk of loss is reduced.

HOUSE BILL  No provision. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The provision modifies the life insurance company proration rule for reducing divi-dends received deductions and reserve deduc-tions with respect to untaxed income. For purposes of the life insurance proration rule of section 805(a)(4), the company’s share is 70 percent. The policyholder’s share is 30 per-cent. Effective date.—The provision applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the Sen-ate amendment. 11. Capitalization of certain policy acquisi-tion expenses (sec. 13519 of the Senate amendment and sec. 848 of the Code) PRESENT LAW  In the case of an insurance company, speci-fied policy acquisition expenses for any tax-able year are required to be capitalized, and generally are amortized over the 120-month period beginning with the first month in the second half of the taxable year.
998 A special rule provides for 60-month amor-tization of the first $5 million of specified policy acquisition expenses with a phase-out. The phase-out reduces the amount amortized over 60 months by the excess of the insur-ance company’s specified policy acquisition expenses for the taxable year over $10 mil-lion. Specified policy acquisition expenses are determined as that portion of the insurance company’s general deductions for the taxable year that does not exceed a specific percent-age of the net premiums for the taxable year on each of three categories of insurance con-tracts. For annuity contracts, the percent-age is 1.75; for group life insurance contracts, the percentage is 2.05; and for all other speci-fied insurance contracts, the percentage is 7.7. With certain exceptions, a specified insur-ance contract is any life insurance, annuity, or noncancellable accident and health insur-ance contract or combination thereof. A group life insurance contract is any life in-surance contract that covers a group of indi-viduals defined by reference to employment relationship, membership in an organization, or similar factor, the premiums for which are determined on a group basis, and the pro-ceeds of which are payable to (or for the ben-efit of) persons other than the employer of the insured, an organization to which the in-sured belongs, or other similar person. 
HOUSE BILL  No provision. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The provision extends the amortization pe-riod for specified policy acquisition expenses from a 120-month period to the 180-month pe-riod beginning with the first month in the second half of the taxable year. The provi-sion does not change the special rule pro-viding for 60-month amortization of the first $5 million of specified policy acquisition ex-penses (with phaseout). The provision pro-vides that for annuity contracts, the per-centage is 2.1 percent; for group life insur-ance contracts, the percentage is 2.46 per-cent; and for all other specified insurance contracts, the percentage is 9.24 percent. Effective date.—The provision applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the Sen-ate amendment with modifications. Under the conference agreement, the amortization period is 180 months. For annuity contracts, the percentage is 2.09 percent; for group life insurance contracts, the percentage is 2.45 percent; and for all other specified insurance contracts, the percentage is 9.20 percent. 2.

999Sec. 101(a)(1). In the case of certain accelerated death benefits and viatical settlements, special rules treat certain amounts as amounts paid by reason of the death of an insured (that is, generally, exclud-able from income). Sec. 101(g). The rules relating to accelerated death benefits provide that amounts treated as paid by reason of the death of the insured include any amount received under a life insurance contract on the life of an insured who is a termi-nally ill individual, or who is a chronically ill indi-vidual (provided certain requirements are met). For this purpose, a terminally ill individual is one who has been certified by a physician as having an ill-ness or physical condition which can reasonably be expected to result in death in 24 months or less after the date of the certification. A chronically ill indi-vidual is one who has been certified by a licensed health care practitioner within the preceding 12- month period as meeting certain ability-related re-quirements. In the case of a viatical settlement, if any portion of the death benefit under a life insur-ance contract on the life of an insured who is termi-nally ill or chronically ill is sold to a viatical settle-ment provider, the amount paid for the sale or as-signment of that portion is treated as an amount paid under the life insurance contract by reason of the death of the insured (that is, generally, exclud-able from income). For this purpose, a viatical set-tlement provider is a person regularly engaged in the trade or business of purchasing, or taking as-signments of, life insurance contracts on the lives of terminally ill or chronically ill individuals (pro-vided certain requirements are met).

999 Under rules known as the transfer for value rules, if a life insurance contract is sold or otherwise transferred for valuable consideration, the amount paid by reason of the death of the insured that is excludable generally is limited.
1000Under the limita-tion, the excludable amount may not exceed the sum of (1) the actual value of the consid-eration, and (2) the premiums or other amounts subsequently paid by the transferee of the contract. Thus, for example, if a per-son buys a life insurance contract, and the consideration he pays combined with his sub-sequent premium payments on the contract are less than the amount of the death benefit he later receives under the contract, then the difference is includable in the buyer’s in-come. Exceptions are provided to the limitation on the excludable amount. The limitation on the excludable amount does not apply if (1) the transferee’s basis in the contract is de-termined in whole or in part by reference to the transferor’s basis in the contract,
1001or (2) the transfer is to the insured, to a partner of the insured, to a partnership in which the insured is a partner, or to a corporation in which the insured is a shareholder or offi-cer.
1002 IRS guidance sets forth more details of the tax treatment of a life insurance policy-holder who sells or surrenders the life insur-ance contract and the tax treatment of other sellers and of buyers of life insurance con-tracts. The guidance relates to the character of taxable amounts (ordinary or capital) and to the taxpayer’s basis in the life insurance contract. In Revenue Ruling 2009–13,
1003the IRS ruled that income recognized under section 72(e) on surrender to the life insurance company of a life insurance contract with cash value is ordinary income. In the case of sale of a cash value life insurance contract, the IRS ruled that the insured’s (seller’s) basis is re-duced by the cost of insurance, and the gain on sale of the contract is ordinary income to the extent of the amount that would be rec-ognized as ordinary income if the contract were surrendered (the ‘‘inside buildup’’), and any excess is long-term capital gain. Gain on the sale of a term life insurance contract (without cash surrender value) is long-term capital gain under the ruling. In Revenue Ruling 2009–14,1004the IRS ruled that under the transfer for value rules, a por-tion of the death benefit received by a buyer of a life insurance contract on the death of the insured is includable as ordinary income. The portion is the excess of the death benefit over the consideration and other amounts (e.g., premiums) paid for the contract. Upon sale of the contract by the purchaser of the contract, the gain is long-term capital gain, and in determining the gain, the basis of the contract is not reduced by the cost of insur-ance. 
HOUSE BILL  No provision. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  In general The provision imposes reporting require-ments in the case of the purchase of an exist-ing life insurance contract in a reportable policy sale and imposes reporting require-ments on the payor in the case of the pay-ment of reportable death benefits. The provi-sion sets forth rules for determining the basis of a life insurance or annuity contract. Lastly, the provision modifies the transfer for value rules in a transfer of an interest in a life insurance contract in a reportable pol-icy sale. Reporting requirements for acquisitions of life insurance contracts Reporting upon acquisition of life insurance contract The reporting requirement applies to every person who acquires a life insurance con-tract, or any interest in a life insurance con-tract, in a reportable policy sale during the taxable year. A reportable policy sale means the acquisition of an interest in a life insur-ance contract, directly or indirectly, if the acquirer has no substantial family, business, or financial relationship with the insured (apart from the acquirer’s interest in the life insurance contract). An indirect acquisition includes the acquisition of an interest in a partnership, trust, or other entity that holds an interest in the life insurance contract. Under the reporting requirement, the buyer reports information about the pur-chase to the IRS, to the insurance company that issued the contract, and to the seller. The information reported by the buyer about the purchase is (1) the buyer’s name, address, and taxpayer identification number (‘‘TIN’’), (2) the name, address, and TIN of each recipi-ent of payment in the reportable policy sale, (3) the date of the sale, (4) the name of the issuer, and (5) the amount of each payment. The statement the buyer provides to any issuer of a life insurance contract is not re-quired to include the amount of the payment or payments for the purchase of the con-tract. Reporting of seller’s basis in the life insurance contract On receipt of a report described above, or on any notice of the transfer of a life insur-ance contract to a foreign person, the issuer is required to report to the IRS and to the seller (1)) the name, address, and TIN of the seller or the transferor to a foreign person, (2) the basis of the contract (i.e., the invest-ment in the contract within the meaning of section 72(e)(6)), and (3) the policy number of the contract. Notice of the transfer of a life insurance contract to a foreign person is in-tended to include any sort of notice, includ-ing information provided for nontax purposes such as change of address notices for pur-poses of sending statements or for other pur-poses, or information relating to loans, pre-miums, or death benefits with respect to the contract. Reporting with respect to reportable death benefits When a reportable death benefit is paid under a life insurance contract, the payor in-surance company is required to report infor-mation about the payment to the IRS and to the payee. Under this reporting requirement, the payor reports (1) the name, address and TIN of the person making the payment, (2) the name, address, and TIN of each recipient of a payment, (3) the date of each such pay-ment, (4) the gross amount of the payment (5) the payor’s estimate of the buyer’s basis in the contract. A reportable death benefit means an amount paid by reason of the death of the insured under a life insurance contract that has been transferred in a re-portable policy sale. For purposes of these reporting require-ments, a payment means the amount of cash and the fair market value of any consider-ation transferred in a reportable policy sale. Determination of basis The provision provides that in determining the basis of a life insurance or annuity con-tract, no adjustment is made for mortality, expense, or other reasonable charges in-curred under the contract (known as ‘‘cost of insurance’’). This reverses the position of the IRS in Revenue Ruling 2009–13 that on sale of a cash value life insurance contract, the in-sured’s (seller’s) basis is reduced by the cost of insurance. Scope of transfer for value rules The provision provides that the exceptions to the transfer for value rules do not apply in the case of a transfer of a life insurance contract, or any interest in a life insurance contract, in a reportable policy sale. Thus, some portion of the death benefit ultimately payable under such a contract may be in-cludable in income. Effective date.—Under the provision, the re-porting requirement is effective for report-able policy sales occurring after December 31, 2017, and reportable death benefits paid after December 31, 2017. The clarification of the basis rules for life insurance and annuity contracts is effective for transactions en-tered into after August 25, 2009. The modi-fication of exception to the transfer for value rules is effective for transfers occurring after December 31, 2017.

PRESENT LAW  In general An employer generally may deduct reason-able compensation for personal services as an ordinary and necessary business expense. Section 162(m) provides an explicit limita-tion on the deductibility of compensation ex-penses in the case of publicly traded cor-porate employers. The otherwise allowable deduction for compensation with respect to a covered employee of a publicly held corpora-tion
1006is limited to no more than $1 million per year.

1017A director is considered an outside director if he or she is not a current employee of the corpora-tion (or related entities), is not a former employee of the corporation (or related entities) who is receiv-ing compensation for prior services (other than ben-efits under a qualified retirement plan), was not an officer of the corporation (or related entities) at any time, and is not currently receiving compensation for personal services in any capacity (e.g., for serv-ices as a consultant) other than as a director. when the deduction attributable to the com-pensation would otherwise be taken. Covered employees Section 162(m) defines a covered employee as (1) the chief executive officer of the cor-poration (or an individual acting in such ca-pacity) as of the close of the taxable year and (2) any employee whose total compensa-tion is required to be reported to share-holders under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (‘‘Exchange Act’’) by reason of being among the corporation’s four most highly compensated officers for the taxable year (other than the chief executive officer).
1008 Treasury regulations under section 162(m) provide that whether an employee is the chief executive officer or among the four most highly compensated officers should be determined pursuant to the executive com-pensation disclosure rules promulgated under the Exchange Act. In 2006, the Securities and Exchange Com-mission amended certain rules relating to executive compensation, including which of-ficers’ compensation must be disclosed under the Exchange Act. Under the new rules, such officers are (1) the principal executive officer (or an individual acting in such capacity), (2) the principal financial officer (or an indi-vidual acting in such capacity), and (3) the three most highly compensated officers, other than the principal executive officer or principal financial officer. In response to the Securities and Exchange Commission’s new disclosure rules, the In-ternal Revenue Service issued updated guid-ance on identifying which employees are covered by section 162(m).
1009The new guid-ance provides that ‘‘covered employee’’ means any employee who is (1) as of the close of the taxable year, the principal exec-utive officer (or an individual acting in such capacity) defined in reference to the Ex-change Act, or (2) among the three most highly compensated officers
1010for the tax- able year (other than the principal executive officer or principal financial officer), again defined by reference to the Exchange Act. Thus, under current guidance, only four em-ployees are covered under section 162(m) for any taxable year. Under Treasury regula-tions, the requirement that the individual meet the criteria as of the last day of the taxable year applies to both the principal ex-ecutive officer and the three highest com-pensated officers.
1011 Definition of publicly held corporation For purposes of the deduction disallowance of section 162(m), a publicly held corporation means any corporation issuing any class of common equity securities required to be reg-istered under section 12 of the Securities Ex-change Act of 1934.
1012All U.S. publicly trad-ed companies are subject to this registration requirement, including their foreign affili-ates. A foreign company publicly traded through American depository receipts (‘‘ADRs’’) is also subject to this registration requirement if more than 50 percent of the issuer’s outstanding voting securities are held, directly or indirectly, by residents of United States and either (i) the majority of the executive officers or directors are United States citizens or residents, (ii) more than 50 percent of the assets of the issuer are located in the United States, or (iii) the business of the issuer is administered principally in the United States. Other foreign companies are not subject to the registration requirement. Remuneration subject to the deduction limita-tion In general Unless specifically excluded, the deduction limitation applies to all remuneration for services, including cash and the cash value of all remuneration (including benefits) paid in a medium other than cash. If an individual is a covered employee for a taxable year, the deduction limitation applies to all com-pensation not explicitly excluded from the deduction limitation, regardless of whether the compensation is for services as a covered employee and regardless of when the com-pensation was earned. The $1 million cap is reduced by excess parachute payments (as defined in section 280G) that are not deduct-ible by the corporation.1013 Certain types of compensation are not sub-ject to the deduction limit and are not taken into account in determining whether other compensation exceeds $1 million. The fol-lowing types of compensation are not taken into account: (1) remuneration payable on a commission basis
1014; (2) remuneration pay-able solely on account of the attainment of one or more performance goals if certain outside director and shareholder approval re-quirements are met (‘‘performance-based compensation’’)
1015; (3) payments to a tax-fa-vored retirement plan (including salary re-duction contributions); (4) amounts that are excludable from the executive’s gross income (such as employer-provided health benefits and miscellaneous fringe benefits
1016); and (5) any remuneration payable under a written binding contract which was in effect on Feb-ruary 17, 1993. In addition, remuneration does not include compensation for which a deduction is allowable after a covered em-ployee ceases to be a covered employee. Thus, the deduction limitation often does not apply to deferred compensation that is otherwise subject to the deduction limita-tion (e.g., is not performance-based com-pensation) because the payment of com-pensation is deferred until after termination of employment. Performance-based compensation Compensation qualifies for the exception for performance-based compensation only if (1) it is paid solely on account of the attain-ment of one or more performance goals, (2) the performance goals are established by a compensation committee consisting solely of two or more outside directors,
1017(3) the ma- terial terms under which the compensation is to be paid, including the performance goals, are disclosed to and approved by the shareholders in a separate majority-ap-proved vote prior to payment, and (4) prior to payment, the compensation committee certifies that the performance goals and any other material terms were in fact satisfied. Compensation (other than stock options or other stock appreciation rights (‘‘SARs’’)) is not treated as paid solely on account of the attainment of one or more performance goals unless the compensation is paid to the par-ticular executive pursuant to a pre-estab-lished objective performance formula or standard that precludes discretion. A stock option or SAR with an exercise price not less than the fair market value, on the date the option or SAR is granted, of the stock sub-ject to the option or SAR, generally is treat-ed as meeting the exception for performance- based compensation, provided that the re-quirements for outside director and share-holder approval are met (without the need for certification that the performance stand-ards have been met). This is the case because the amount of compensation attributable to the options or SARs received by the execu-tive is based solely on an increase in the cor-poration’s stock price. Stock-based com-pensation is not treated as performance- based if it depends on factors other than cor-porate performance. HOUSE BILL  Definition of covered employee The provision revises the definition of cov-ered employee to include both the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer. Further, an individual is a covered employee if the individual holds one of these positions at any time during the taxable year. The provision also defines as a covered employee the three (rather than four) most highly compensated officers for the taxable year (other than the principal executive offi-cer or principal financial officer) who are re-quired to be reported on the company’s proxy statement (i.e., the statement required pursuant to executive compensation disclo-sure rules promulgated under the Exchange Act) for the taxable year (or who would be required to be reported on such a statement for a company not required to make such a report to shareholders). This includes such officers of a corporation not required to file a proxy statement but which otherwise falls within the revised definition of a publicly held corporation, as well as such officers of a publicly traded corporation that would oth-erwise have been required to file a proxy statement for the year (for example, but for the fact that the corporation delisted its se-curities or underwent a transaction that re-sulted in the nonapplication of the proxy statement requirement). In addition, if an individual is a covered employee with respect to a corporation for a taxable year beginning after December 31, 2016, the individual remains a covered em-ployee for all future years. Thus, an indi-vidual remains a covered employee with re-spect to compensation otherwise deductible for subsequent years, including for years during which the individual is no longer em-ployed by the corporation and years after the individual has died. Compensation does not fail to be compensation with respect to a covered employee and thus subject to the de-duction limit for a taxable year merely be-cause the compensation is includible in the income of, or paid to, another individual, such as compensation paid to a beneficiary after the employee’s death, or to a former spouse pursuant to a domestic relations order. Definition of publicly held corporation The provision extends the applicability of section 162(m) to include all domestic pub-licly traded corporations and all foreign companies publicly traded through ADRs. The proposed definition may include certain additional corporations that are not publicly traded, such as large private C or S corpora-tions. Performance-based compensation and com-missions exceptions The provision eliminates the exceptions for commissions and performance-based com-pensation from the definition of compensa-tion subject to the deduction limit.

Effective date.—The provision is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The Senate amendment follows the House bill, except that it adds a transition rule for remuneration which is provided pursuant to a written binding contract which was in ef-fect on November 2, 2017 and which was not modified in any material respect on or after such date. Effective date.—The provision applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. A transition rule applies to remunera-tion which is provided pursuant to a written binding contract which was in effect on No-vember 2, 2017 and which was not modified in any material respect on or after such date. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the Sen-ate amendment. For purposes of the transi-tion rule, compensation paid pursuant to a plan qualifies for this exception provided that the right to participate in the plan is part of a written binding contract with the covered employee in effect on November 2, 2017. For example, suppose a covered em-ployee was hired by XYZ Corporation on Oc-tober 2, 2017 and one of the terms of the writ-ten employment contract is that the execu-tive is eligible to participate in the ‘XYZ Corporation Executive Deferred Compensa-tion Plan’ in accordance with the terms of the plan. Assume further that the terms of the plan provide for participation after 6 months of employment, amounts payable under the plan are not subject to discretion, and the corporation does not have the right to amend materially the plan or terminate the plan (except on a prospective basis before any services are performed with respect to the applicable period for which such com-pensation is to be paid). Provided that the other conditions of the binding contract ex-ception are met (e.g., the plan itself is in writing), payments under the plan are grand-fathered, even though the employee was not actually a participant in the plan on Novem-ber 2, 2017.
1018 The fact that a plan was in existence on November 2, 2017 is not by itself sufficient to qualify the plan for the exception for binding written contracts. The exception for remuneration paid pur-suant to a binding written contract ceases to apply to amounts paid after there has been a material modification to the terms of the contract. The exception does not apply to new contracts entered into or renewed after November 2, 2017. For purposes of this rule, any contract that is entered into on or be-fore November 2, 2017 and that is renewed after such date is treated as a new contract entered into on the day the renewal takes ef-fect. A contract that is terminable or cancelable unconditionally at will by either party to the contract without the consent of the other, or by both parties to the contract, is treated as a new contract entered into on the date any such termination or cancella-tion, if made, would be effective. However, a contract is not treated as so terminable or cancelable if it can be terminated or can-celled only by terminating the employment relationship of the covered employee. 2. Excise tax on excess tax-exempt organiza-tion executive compensation (sec. 3802 of the House bill, sec. 13602 of the Senate amendment, and sec. 4960 of the Code) PRESENT LAW  Taxable employers and other service re-cipients generally may deduct reasonable compensation expenses.
1019However, in some cases, compensation in excess of specific lev-els is not deductible. A publicly held corporation generally can-not deduct more than $1 million of com-pensation (that is not compensation other-wise excepted from this limit) in a taxable year for each ‘‘covered employee.’’
1020For this purpose, a covered employee is the cor-poration’s principal executive officer (or an individual acting in such capacity) defined in reference to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (‘‘Exchange Act’’) as of the close of the taxable year, or any employee whose total compensation is required to be reported to shareholders under the Exchange Act by rea-son of being among the corporation’s three most highly compensated officers for the taxable year (other than the principal execu-tive officer or principal financial officer).
1021 Unless an exception applies, generally a corporation cannot deduct that portion of the aggregate present value of a ‘‘parachute payment’’ which equals or exceeds three times the ‘‘base amount’’ of certain service providers. The nondeductible excess is an ‘‘excess parachute payment.’’
1022 A para- chute payment is generally a payment of compensation that is contingent on a change in corporate ownership or control made to certain officers, shareholders, and highly compensated individuals.
1023An individual’s base amount is the average annualized com-pensation includible in the individual’s gross income for the five taxable years ending be-fore the date on which the change in owner-ship or control occurs.
1024Certain amounts are not considered parachute payments, in-cluding payments under a qualified retire-ment plan, a simplified employee pension plan, or a simple retirement account.
1025 These deduction limits generally do not af-fect a tax-exempt organization. 
HOUSE BILL  Under the provision, an employer is liable for an excise tax equal to 20 percent of the sum of (1) any remuneration (other than an excess parachute payment) in excess of $1 million paid to a covered employee by an ap-plicable tax-exempt organization for a tax-able year, and (2) any excess parachute pay-ment (under a new definition for this purpose that relates solely to separation pay) paid by the applicable tax-exempt organization to a covered employee. Accordingly, the excise tax applies as a result of an excess parachute payment, even if the covered employee’s re-muneration does not exceed $1 million. For purposes of the provision, a covered employee is an employee (including any former employee) of an applicable tax-ex-empt organization if the employee is one of the five highest compensated employees of the organization for the taxable year or was a covered employee of the organization (or a predecessor) for any preceding taxable year beginning after December 31, 2016. An ‘‘appli-cable tax-exempt organization’’ is an organi-zation exempt from tax under section 501(a), an exempt farmers’ cooperative,
1026a Fed-eral, State or local governmental entity with excludable income,1027or a political organi-zation.
1028 Remuneration means wages as defined for income tax withholding purposes,
1029 but does not include any designated Roth con-tribution.
1030Remuneration of a covered em-ployee includes any remuneration paid with respect to employment of the covered em-ployee by any person or governmental entity related to the applicable tax-exempt organi-zation. A person or governmental entity is treated as related to an applicable tax-ex-empt organization if the person or govern-mental entity (1) controls, or is controlled by, the organization, (2) is controlled by one or more persons that control the organiza-tion, (3) is a supported organization
1031dur- ing the taxable year with respect to the or-ganization, (4) is a supporting organiza-tion
1032during the taxable year with respect to the organization, or (5) in the case of a voluntary employees’ beneficiary association (‘‘VEBA’’),
1033 establishes, maintains, or makes contributions to the VEBA. However, remuneration of a covered employee that is not deductible by reason of the $1 million limit on deductible compensation is not taken into account for purposes of the provi-sion. Under the provision, an excess parachute payment is the amount by which any para-chute payment exceeds the portion of the base amount allocated to the payment. A parachute payment is a payment in the na-ture of compensation to (or for the benefit of) a covered employee if the payment is con-tingent on the employee’s separation from employment and the aggregate present value of all such payments equals or exceeds three times the base amount. The base amount is the average annualized compensation includ-ible in the covered employee’s gross income for the five taxable years ending before the date of the employee’s separation from em-ployment. Parachute payments do not in-clude payments under a qualified retirement plan, a simplified employee pension plan, a simple retirement account, a tax-deferred annuity,
1034or an eligible deferred compensa-tion plan of a State or local government em-ployer.
1035 The employer of a covered employee is lia-ble for the excise tax. If remuneration of a covered employee from more than one em-ployer is taken into account in determining the excise tax, each employer is liable for the tax in an amount that bears the same ratio to the total tax as the remuneration paid by that employer bears to the remu-neration paid by all employers to the cov-ered employee. Effective date.—The provision is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The Senate amendment is the same as the House bill, except that remuneration is treated as paid when there is no substantial risk of forfeiture of the rights to such remu-neration. In addition, the definition of remu-neration for this purpose includes amounts

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H10077 December 15, 2017 
1036Sec. 457(f) applies to an ‘‘ineligible’’ deferred compensation plan of a State or local government or a tax-exempt employer (that is, a plan that does not meet the requirements to be an eligible plan under section 457(b)). Under an ineligible plan, deferred amounts are treated as nonqualified deferred com-pensation and includible in income for the first tax-able year in which there is no substantial risk of for-feiture of the rights to such compensation. For this purpose, a person’s rights to compensation are sub-ject to a substantial risk of forfeiture if the rights are conditioned on the future performance of sub-stantial services by any individual. Earnings post- vesting are generally taxed when paid. 
1037Sec. 83. Section 83 applies generally to trans-fers of any property, not just employer stock, in connection with the performance of services by any service provider, not just an employee. However, the provision described herein applies only with respect to certain employer stock transferred to employees. 1038Under Treas. Reg. sec. 1.83–2, the employee makes an election by filing with the Internal Rev-enue Service a written statement that includes the fair market value of the property at the time of transfer and the amount (if any) paid for the prop-erty. The employee must also provide a copy of the statement to the employer. 
1039See section 83(c)(1) and Treas. Reg. sec. 1.83– 3(c) for the definition of substantial risk of for-feiture. 
1040Treas. Reg. sec. 1.83–3(d). In addition, under section 83(c)(2), the right to stock is transferable only if any transferee’s right to the stock would not be subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture. 
1041Sec. 83(h). 
1042Treas. Reg. sec. 1.83–6. 
1043See section 83(e)(3) and Treas. Reg. sec. 1.83–7. A nonqualified option is an option on employer stock that is not a statutory option, discussed below. 1044Treas. Reg. sec. 1.83–6(a)(3). 
1045Secs. 3101–3128 (FICA), 3301–3311 (FUTA), and 3401–3404 (income tax withholding). Instead of FICA taxes, railroad employers and employees are subject, under the Railroad Retirement Tax Act (‘‘RRTA’’), sections 3201–3241, to taxes equivalent to FICA taxes with respect to compensation as defined for RRTA purposes. Sections 3501–3510 provide additional rules relating to all these taxes. 
1046Sec. 3121(v); Treas. Reg. sec. 31.3121(v)(2). 
1047The employee portion of the HI tax under FICA (not the employer portion) is increased by an addi-tional tax of 0.9 percent on wages received in excess of a threshold amount. The threshold amount is $250,000 in the case of a joint return, $125,000 in the case of a married individual filing a separate return, and $200,000 in any other case. 
1048Under section 3501(b), employment taxes with respect to noncash fringe benefits are to be collected (or paid) by the employer at the time and in the manner prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury (‘‘Treasury’’). Announcement 85–113, 1985–31 I.R.B. 31, provides guidance on the application of employ-ment taxes with respect to noncash fringe benefits. 
1049Sec. 3402. Specific withholding rates apply in the case of supplemental wages. required to be included in gross income under section 457(f).
1036 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the Sen-ate amendment with modifications. Under the conference agreement, the tax rate is equal to corporate tax rate, which is 21 per-cent under the conference agreement. In ad-dition, for purposes of the requirement to treat remuneration as paid when the rights to the remuneration are no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture, the con-ference agreement clarifies that ‘‘substantial risk of forfeiture’’ is based on the definition under section 457(f)(3)(B) which applies to in-eligible deferred compensation subject to section 457(f). Accordingly, the tax imposed by this provision can apply to the value of remuneration that is vested (and any in-creases in such value or vested remunera-tion) under this definition, even if it is not yet received. The conference agreement exempts com-pensation paid to employees who are not highly compensated employees (within the meaning of section 414(q)) from the defini-tion of parachute payment, and also exempts compensation attributable to medical serv-ices of certain qualified medical profes-sionals from the definitions of remuneration and parachute payment. For purposes of de-termining a covered employee, remuneration paid to a licensed medical professional which is directly related to the performance of medical or veterinary services by such pro-fessional is not taken into account, whereas remuneration paid to such a professional in any other capacity is taken into account. A medical professional for this purpose in-cludes a doctor, nurse, or veterinarian. 3. Treatment of qualified equity grants (sec. 3803 of the House bill, sec. 13603 of the Senate amendment, and secs. 83, 3401, and 6051 of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  Income tax treatment of employer stock trans-ferred to an employee Specific rules apply to property, including employer stock, transferred to an employee in connection with the performance of serv-ices.
1037These rules govern the amount and timing of income inclusion by the employee and the amount and timing of the employer’s compensation deduction. Under these rules, an employee generally must recognize income in the taxable year in which the employee’s right to the stock is transferable or is not subject to a substan-tial risk of forfeiture, whichever occurs ear-lier (referred to herein as ‘‘substantially vested’’). Thus, if the employee’s right to the stock is substantially vested when the stock is transferred to the employee, the employee recognizes income in the taxable year of such transfer, in an amount equal to the fair market value of the stock as of the date of transfer (less any amount paid for the stock). If at the time the stock is transferred to the employee, the employee’s right to the stock is not substantially vested (referred to herein as ‘‘nonvested’’), the employee does not recognize income attributable to the stock transfer until the taxable year in which the employee’s right becomes substan-tially vested. In this case, the amount in-cludible in the employee’s income is the fair market value of the stock as of the date that the employee’s right to the stock is substan-tially vested (less any amount paid for the stock). However, if the employee’s right to the stock is nonvested at the time the stock is transferred to employee, under section 83(b), the employee may elect within 30 days of transfer to recognize income in the tax-able year of transfer, referred to as a ‘‘sec-tion 83(b)’’ election.1038If a proper and timely election under section 83(b) is made, the amount of compensatory income is capped at the amount equal to the fair market value of the stock as of the date of transfer (less any amount paid for the stock). A section 83(b) election is available with respect to grants of ‘‘restricted stock’’ (nonvested stock), and does not generally apply to the grant of op-tions. In general, an employee’s right to stock or other property is subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture if the employee’s right to full enjoyment of the property is subject to a condition, such as the future performance of substantial services.
1039An employee’s right to stock or other property is transfer-able if the employee can transfer an interest in the property to any person other than the transferor of the property.
1040Thus, gen- erally, employer stock transferred to an em-ployee by an employer is not transferable merely because the employee can sell it back to the employer. In the case of stock transferred to an em-ployee, the employer is allowed a deduction (to the extent a deduction for a business ex-pense is otherwise allowable) equal to the amount included in the employee’s income as a result of transfer of the stock.
1041The employer deduction generally is permitted in the employer’s taxable year in which or with which ends the employee’s taxable year when the amount is included and properly reported in the employee’s income.
1042 These rules do not apply to the grant of a nonqualified option on employer stock un-less the option has a readily ascertainable fair market value.
1043Instead, these rules apply to the transfer of employer stock by the employee on exercise of the option. That is, if the right to the stock is substantially vested on transfer (the time of exercise), in-come recognition applies for the taxable year of transfer. If the right to the stock is nonvested on transfer, the timing of income inclusion is determined under the rules ap-plicable to the transfer of nonvested stock. In either case, the amount includible in in-come by the employee is the fair market value of the stock as of the required time of income inclusion, less the exercise price paid by the employee. A section 83(b) election generally does not apply to the grant of op-tions. If upon the exercise of an option, non-vested stock is transferred to the employee, a section 83(b) election may apply. The em-ployer’s deduction is generally determined under the rules that apply to transfers of re-stricted stock, but a special accrual rule may apply under Treasury regulations when the transferred stock is substantially vest-ed.1044 Employment taxes and reporting Employment taxes generally consist of taxes under the Federal Insurance Contribu-tions Act (‘‘FICA’’), tax under the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (‘‘FUTA’’), and in-come taxes required to be withheld by em-ployers from wages paid to employees (‘‘in-come tax withholding’’).
1045Unless an excep-tion applies under the applicable rules, com-pensation provided to an employee con-stitutes wages subject to these taxes. FICA imposes tax on employers and em-ployees, generally based on the amount of wages paid to an employee during the year. Special rules as to the timing and amount of FICA taxes apply in the case of nonqualified deferred compensation, as defined for FICA purposes.
1046 The tax imposed on the employer and on the employee is each composed of two parts: (1) the Social Security or old age, survivors, and disability insurance (‘‘OASDI’’) tax equal to 6.2 percent of covered wages up to the OASDI wage base ($127,200 for 2017); and (2) the Medicare or hospital insurance (‘‘HI’’) tax equal to 1.45 percent of all covered wages.
1047The employee portion of FICA tax generally must be withheld and, along with the employer portion, remitted to the Fed-eral government by the employer. FICA tax withholding applies regardless of whether compensation is provided in the form of cash or a noncash form, such as a transfer of prop-erty (including employer stock) or in-kind benefits.
1048 FUTA imposes a tax on employers of six percent of wages up to the FUTA wage base of $7,000. Income tax withholding generally applies when wages are paid by an employer to an employee, based on graduated withholding rates set out in tables published by the In-ternal Revenue Service (‘‘IRS’’).
1049 Like FICA tax withholding, income tax with-holding applies regardless of whether com-pensation is provided in the form of cash or a noncash form, such as a transfer of prop-erty (including employer stock) or in-kind benefits. An employer is required to furnish each employee with a statement of compensation

1050Secs. 6041 and 6051. 
1051Employers send Form W–2 information to the Social Security Administration, which records in-formation relating to Social Security and Medicare and forwards the Form W–2 information to the IRS. Employees include a copy of Form W–2 with their income tax returns. 
1052Sections 421–424 govern statutory options. Sec-tion 423(b)(5) requires that, under the terms of an ESPP, all employees granted options generally must have the same rights and privileges. 
1053Under section 56(b)(3), this income tax treat-ment with respect to stock received on exercise of an ISO does not apply for purposes of the alternative minimum tax under section 55. 
1054Secs. 3121(a)(22), 3306(b)(19), and the last sen-tence of section 421(b). 
1055Compensation earned by an employee is gen-erally paid to the employee shortly after being earned. However, in some cases, payment is deferred to a later period, referred to as ‘‘deferred compensa-tion.’’ Deferred compensation may be provided through a plan that receives tax-favored treatment, such as a qualified retirement plan under section 401(a). Deferred compensation provided through a plan that is not eligible for tax-favored treatment is referred to as ‘‘nonqualified’’ deferred compensation. 1056Treas. Reg. sec. 1.409A–1(d). 
1057Section 409A and the regulations thereunder provide rules for nonqualified deferred compensa-tion. Compensation that fails to meet the require-ments of section 409A is also subject to an additional income tax of 20% on amounts includible in income and a potential interest factor tax (‘‘409A taxes’’). Section 409A and the additional 409A taxes apply to increases in the value of the failed compensation each year until it is paid. 
1058Treas. Reg. sec. 1.409A–1(b)(6). 
1059Treas. Reg. sec. 1.409A–1(b)(5). In addition, stat-utory option arrangements are not nonqualified de-ferred compensation arrangements. 
1060Sec. 404(a)(5). 
1061Thus, for this purpose, the qualified stock is considered transferable if the employee has the abil-ity to sell the stock to the employer (or any other person). 
1062An established securities market is determined for this purpose by the Secretary, but does not in-clude any market unless the market is recognized as an established securities market for purposes of an-other Code provision. 
1063An inclusion deferral election is revoked at the time and in the manner as the Secretary provides. 
1064Thus, as in the case of a section 83(b) election under present law, the employee must file with the IRS the inclusion deferral election and provide the employer with a copy. 
1065This requirement is met if the stock purchased by the corporation includes all the corporation’s outstanding deferral stock. 
1066For purposes of the requirement that an ESPP provide employees with the same rights and privi-leges, the rules of the provision apply in deter-mining which employees have the right to make an inclusion deferral election with respect to stock re-ceived under the ESPP. information for a calendar year, including taxable compensation, FICA wages, and withheld income and FICA taxes.
1050In addi- tion, information relating to certain non-taxable items must be reported, such as cer-tain retirement and health plan contribu-tions. The statement, made on Form W–2, Wage and Tax Statement, must be provided to each employee by January 31 of the suc-ceeding year.
1051 Statutory options Two types of statutory options apply with respect to employer stock: incentive stock options (‘‘ISOs’’) and options provided under an employee stock purchase plan (‘‘ESPP’’).
1052Stock received pursuant to a statutory option is subject to special rules, rather than the rules for nonqualified op-tions, discussed above. No amount is includ-ible in an employee’s income on the grant, vesting, or exercise of a statutory option.
1053 In addition, generally no deduction is al-lowed to the employer with respect to the option or the stock transferred to an em-ployee. If a holding requirement is met with re-spect to the stock transferred on exercise of a statutory option and the employee later disposes of the stock, the employee’s gain generally is treated as capital gain rather than ordinary income. Under the holding re-quirement, the employee must not dispose of the stock within two years after the date the option is granted and also must not dispose of the stock within one year after the date the option is exercised. If a disposition oc-curs before the end of the required holding period (a ‘‘disqualifying disposition’’), the employee recognizes ordinary income in the taxable year in which the disqualifying dis-position occurs and the employer may be al-lowed a corresponding deduction in the tax-able year in which such disposition occurs. The amount of ordinary income recognized when a disqualifying disposition occurs gen-erally equals the fair market value of the stock on the date of exercise (that is, when the stock was transferred to the employee) less the exercise price paid. Employment taxes do not apply with re-spect to the grant or vesting of a statutory option, transfer of stock pursuant to the op-tion, or a disposition (including a disquali-fying disposition) of the stock.
1054However, certain special reporting requirements apply. Nonqualified deferred compensation Compensation is generally includible in an employee’s income when paid to the em-ployee. However, in the case of a non-qualified deferred compensation plan,
1055un- less the arrangement either is exempt from or meets the requirements of section 409A, the amount of deferred compensation is first includible in income for the taxable year when not subject to a substantial risk of for-feiture (as defined1056), even if payment will not occur until a later year.
1057In general, to meet the requirements of section 409A, the time when nonqualified deferred compensa-tion will be paid, as well as the amount, must be specified at the time of deferral with limits on further deferral after the time for payment. Various other requirements apply, including that payment can only occur on specific defined events. Various exemptions from section 409A apply, including transfers of property subject to section 83.
1058Nonqualified options are not automatically exempt from section 409A, but may be structured so as not to be considered nonqualified deferred compensation.
1059A re- stricted stock unit (‘‘RSU’’) is a term used for an arrangement under which an employee has the right to receive at a specified time in the future an amount determined by ref-erence to the value of one or more shares of employer stock. An employee’s right to re-ceive the future amount may be subject to a condition, such as continued employment for a certain period or the attainment of certain performance goals. The payment to the em-ployee of the amount due under the arrange-ment is referred to as settlement of the RSU. The arrangement may provide for the settle-ment amount to be paid in cash or as a transfer of employer stock (or either). An ar-rangement providing RSUs is generally con-sidered a nonqualified deferred compensation plan and is subject to the rules, including the limits, of section 409A. The employer de-duction generally is permitted in the em-ployer’s taxable year in which or with which ends the employee’s taxable year when the amount is included and properly reported in the employee’s income.
1060 
HOUSE BILL  In general The provision allows a qualified employee to elect to defer, for income tax purposes, the inclusion in income of the amount of in-come attributable to qualified stock trans-ferred to the employee by the employer. An election to defer income inclusion (‘‘inclu-sion deferral election’’) with respect to qualified stock must be made no later than 30 days after the first time the employee’s right to the stock is substantially vested or is transferable, whichever occurs earlier. If an employee elects to defer income in-clusion under the provision, the income must be included in the employee’s income for the taxable year that includes the earliest of (1) the first date the qualified stock becomes transferable, including, solely for this pur-pose, transferable to the employer;1A
1061(2) the date the employee first becomes an ex-cluded employee (as described below); (3) the first date on which any stock of the em-ployer becomes readily tradable on an estab-lished securities market;
1062(4) the date five years after the first date the employee’s right to the stock becomes substantially vested; or (5) the date on which the employee revokes her inclusion deferral election.1063 An inclusion deferral election is made in a manner similar to the manner in which a section 83(b) election is made.
1064The provi- sion does not apply to income with respect to nonvested stock that is includible as a re-sult of a section 83(b) election. The provision clarifies that Section 83 (other than the pro-vision), including subsection (b), shall not apply to RSUs. Therefore, RSUs are not eli-gible for a section 83(b) election. This is the case because, absent this provision, RSUs are nonqualified deferred compensation and therefore subject to the rules that apply to nonqualified deferred compensation. An employee may not make an inclusion deferral election for a year with respect to qualified stock if, in the preceding calendar year, the corporation purchased any of its outstanding stock unless at least 25 percent of the total dollar amount of the stock so purchased is stock with respect to which an inclusion deferral election is in effect (‘‘de-ferral stock’’) and the determination of which individuals from whom deferral stock is purchased is made on a reasonable basis.
1065For purposes of this requirement, stock purchased from an individual is not treated as deferral stock (and the purchase is not treated as a purchase of deferral stock) if, immediately after the purchase, the indi-vidual holds any deferral stock with respect to which an inclusion deferral election has been in effect for a longer period than the election with respect to the purchased stock. Thus, in general, in applying the purchase requirement, an individual’s deferral stock with respect to which an inclusion deferral election has been in effect for the longest pe-riods must be purchased first. A corporation that has deferral stock outstanding as of the beginning of any calendar year and that pur-chases any of its outstanding stock during the calendar year must report on its income tax return for the taxable year in which, or with which, the calendar year ends the total dollar amount of the outstanding stock pur-chased during the calendar year and such other information as the Secretary may re-quire for purposes of administering this re-quirement. A qualified employee may make an inclu-sion deferral election with respect to quali-fied stock attributable to a statutory op-tion.
1066In that case, the option is not treat-ed as a statutory option and the rules relat-ing to statutory options and related stock do not apply. In addition, an arrangement under which an employee may receive qualified stock is not treated as a nonqualified de-ferred compensation plan solely because of an employee’s inclusion deferral election or ability to make an election. Deferred income inclusion applies also for purposes of the employer’s deduction of the amount of income attributable to the quali-fied stock. That is, if an employee makes an inclusion deferral election, the employer’s

1067One-percent owner status is determined under the top-heavy rules for qualified retirement plans, that is, section 416(i)(1)(B)(ii). 
1068In the case of one-percent owners, this results from application of the attribution rules of section 318 under section 416(i)(1)(B)(i)(II). Family members are determined under section 318(a)(1) and generally include an individual’s spouse, children, grand-children and parents. 
1069These officers are determined on the basis of shareholder disclosure rules for compensation under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as if such rules applied to the corporation. 
1070This requirement continues to apply up to the time an inclusion deferral election is made. That is, under the provision, no inclusion deferral election may be made with respect to qualified stock if any stock of the corporation is readily tradable on an es-tablished securities market at any time before the election is made. 
1071In applying the requirement that 80 percent of employees receive stock options or RSUs, excluded employees and part-time employees are not taken into account. For this purpose, part-time employee is defined under section 4980G(d)(4), as an employee who is customarily employed for fewer than 30 hours per week. 1072Sec. 423(b)(5). 
1073Under a transition rule, in the case of a cal-endar year beginning before January 1, 2018, the 80- percent requirement is applied without regard to whether the rights and privileges with respect to the qualified stock are the same. 
1074As defined in sec. 1563(a). 
1075That is, the maximum rate of tax in effect for the year under section 1. The provision specifies that qualified stock is treated as a noncash fringe benefit for income tax withholding purposes. deduction is deferred until the employer’s taxable year in which or with which ends the taxable year of the employee for which the amount is included in the employee’s income as described in (1)–(5) above. Qualified employee and qualified stock Under the provision, a qualified employee means an individual who is not an excluded employee and who agrees, in the inclusion deferral election, to meet the requirements necessary (as determined by the Secretary) to ensure the income tax withholding re-quirements of the employer corporation with respect to the qualified stock (as described below) are met. For this purpose, an ex-cluded employee with respect to a corpora-tion is any individual (1) who was a one-per-cent owner of the corporation at any time during the 10 preceding calendar years,
1067(2) who is, or has been at any prior time, the chief executive officer or chief financial offi-cer of the corporation or an individual acting in either capacity, (3) who is a family mem-ber of an individual described in (1) or (2),
1068 or (4) who has been one of the four highest compensated officers of the corporation for any of the 10 preceding taxable years.
1069 Qualified stock is any stock of a corpora-tion if— ∑an employee receives the stock in con-nection with the exercise of an option or in settlement of an RSU, and ∑the option or RSU was granted by the corporation to the employee in connection with the performance of services and in a year in which the corporation was an eligible corporation (as described below). However, qualified stock does not include any stock if, at the time the employee’s right to the stock becomes substantially vested, the employee may sell the stock to, or otherwise receive cash in lieu of stock from, the corporation. Qualified stock can only be such if it relates to stock received in connection with options or RSUs, and does not include stock received in connection with other forms of equity compensation, in-cluding stock appreciation rights or re-stricted stock. A corporation is an eligible corporation with respect to a calendar year if (1) no stock of the employer corporation (or any predecessor) is readily tradable on an estab-lished securities market during any pre-ceding calendar year,
1070and (2) the corpora-tion has a written plan under which, in the calendar year, not less than 80 percent of all employees who provide services to the cor-poration in the United States (or any U.S. possession) are granted stock options, or re-stricted stock units (‘‘RSUs’’), with the same rights and privileges to receive qualified stock (‘‘80-percent requirement’’).
1071 For this purpose, in general, the determination of rights and privileges with respect to stock is determined in a similar manner as pro-vided under the present-law ESPP rules.1072 However, employees will not fail to be treat-ed as having the same rights and privileges to receive qualified stock solely because the number of shares available to all employees is not equal in amount, provided that the number of shares available to each employee is more than a de minimis amount. In addi-tion, rights and privileges with respect to the exercise of a stock option are not treated for this purpose as the same as rights and privileges with respect to the settlement of an RSU.
1073 For purposes of the provision, corporations that are members of the same controlled group
1074are treated as one corporation. Notice, withholding and reporting require-ments Under the provision, a corporation that transfers qualified stock to a qualified em-ployee must provide a notice to the qualified employee at the time (or a reasonable period before) the employee’s right to the qualified stock is substantially vested (and income at-tributable to the stock would first be includ-ible absent an inclusion deferral election). The notice must (1) certify to the employee that the stock is qualified stock, and (2) no-tify the employee (a) that the employee may (if eligible) elect to defer income inclusion with respect to the stock and (b) that, if the employee makes an inclusion deferral elec-tion, the amount of income required to be in-cluded at the end of the deferral period will be based on the value of the stock at the time the employee’s right to the stock first becomes substantially vested, notwith-standing whether the value of the stock has declined during the deferral period (includ-ing whether the value of the stock has de-clined below the employee’s tax liability with respect to such stock), and the amount of income to be included at the end of the de-ferral period will be subject to withholding as provided under the provision, as well as of the employee’s responsibilities with respect to required withholding. Failure to provide the notice may result in the imposition of a penalty of $100 for each failure, subject to a maximum penalty of $50,000 for all failures during any calendar year. An inclusion deferral election applies only for income tax purposes. The application of FICA and FUTA are not affected. The provi-sion includes specific income tax with-holding and reporting requirements with re-spect to income subject to an inclusion de-ferral election. For the taxable year for which income sub-ject to an inclusion deferral election is re-quired to be included in income by the em-ployee (as described above), the amount re-quired to be included in income is treated as wages with respect to which the employer is required to withhold income tax at a rate not less than the highest income tax rate ap-plicable to individual taxpayers.
1075The em- ployer must report on Form W-2 the amount of income covered by an inclusion deferral election (1) for the year of deferral and (2) for the year the income is required to be in-cluded in income by the employee. In addi-tion, for any calendar year, the employer must report on Form W-2 the aggregate amount of income covered by inclusion de-ferral elections, determined as of the close of the calendar year. Effective date.—The provision generally ap-plies with respect to stock attributable to options exercised or RSUs settled after De-cember 31, 2017. Under a transition rule, until the Secretary (or the Secretary’s dele-gate) issues regulations or other guidance implementing the 80-percent and employer notice requirements under the provision, a corporation will be treated as complying with those requirements (respectively) if it complies with a reasonable good faith inter-pretation of the requirements. The penalty for a failure to provide the notice required under the provision applies to failures after December 31, 2017. SENATE AMENDMENT  The Senate amendment is the same as the House bill, except that, for purposes of deter-mining corporations that are members of the same controlled group and treated as one corporation, the definition of controlled group under section 414(b) applies. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the Sen-ate amendment with modifications. The con-ference agreement clarifies that (1) when an inclusion deferral election is made with re-spect to stock transferred under an ESPP, the option is not considered an ESPP, such that when an inclusion deferral election is made in connection with the exercise of both ESPPs and ISOs, the options are not treated as statutory options but rather as non-qualified stock options for FICA purposes (in addition to being subject to section 83(i) for income tax purposes), (2) an excluded em-ployee includes an individual who first be-comes a 1 percent owner or one of the 4 high-est compensated officers in a taxable year, notwithstanding that such individual may not have been among such categories for the 10 preceding taxable years, (3) the require-ment that 80 percent of all applicable em-ployees be granted stock options or re-stricted stock units with the same rights and privileges cannot be satisfied in a taxable year by granting a combination of stock op-tions and RSUs, and instead all such employ-ees must either be granted stock options or be granted restricted stock units for that year, and (4) the exception from treatment as a nonqualified deferred compensation plan for purposes of section 409A applies solely with respect to an employee who may re-ceive qualified stock. It is intended that the requirement that 80 percent of all applicable employees be granted stock options or be granted restricted stock units apply consist-ently to eligible employees, whether they are new hires or existing employees. Addi-tionally, it is intended that the limited cir-cumstances outlined in section 83(c)(3) and applicable regulations apply with respect to the determination of when stock first be-comes transferrable or is no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture. For exam-ple, income inclusion cannot be delayed due to a lock-up period as a result of an initial public offering. Finally, it is intended that the transition rule provided with respect to compliance with the 80-percent and employer notice requirements not be expanded beyond these specific items.

1076The terms ‘‘employer’’ and ‘‘employee’’ are used, although the provision herein also applies to individuals who are not employees and the service recipients of such non-employee individuals. 
1077See section 83(c)(1) and Treas. Reg. sec. 1.83– 3(c) for the definition of substantial risk of for-feiture. 
1078Under section 83(b), the employee may elect within 30 days of transfer to recognize income in the taxable year of transfer, referred to as a ‘‘section 83(b)’’ election. If a proper and timely election under section 83(b) is made, the amount of compensatory income is capped at the amount equal to the fair market value of the stock as of the date of transfer (less any amount paid for the stock). 
1079See section 83(e)(3) and Treas. Reg. sec. 1.83–7. A nonqualified option is an option on employer stock that is not a statutory option, discussed below. 1080Sections 421–424 govern statutory options. Sec-tion 423(b)(5) requires that, under the terms of an ESPP, all employees granted options generally must have the same rights and privileges. 
1081Secs. 422(a)(2) and 423(a)(2). 
1082Section 409A and the regulations thereunder provide rules for nonqualified deferred compensa-tion. Unless an arrangement either is exempt from or meets the requirements of section 409A, the amount of deferred compensation is first includible in income for the taxable year when not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture (as defined), even if payment will not occur until a later year. In gen-eral, to meet the requirements of section 409A, the time when nonqualified deferred compensation will be paid, as well as the amount, must be specified at the time of deferral with limits on further deferral after the time for payment. Various other require-ments apply, including that payment can only occur on specific defined events. Compensation that fails to meet the requirements of section 409A is also sub-ject to an additional income tax of 20 percent on amounts includible in income and a potential inter-est factor tax (‘‘409A taxes’’). Section 409A and the additional 409A taxes apply to increases in the value of the failed compensation each year until it is paid.

1089An expanded affiliated group is an affiliated group (under section 1504) except that such group is determined without regard to the exceptions for cer-tain corporations and is determined by substituting ‘‘more than 50 percent’’ for ‘‘at least 80 percent.’’ 
1090An officer is defined as the president, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer (or, if there is no such accounting officer, the controller), any vice-president in charge of a principal business unit, division or function (such as sales, administra-tion or finance), any other officer who performs a policy-making function, or any other person who performs similar policy-making functions. 4. Increase in excise tax rate for stock com-pensation of insiders in expatriated cor-porations (sec. 13604 of the Senate amendment and sec. 4985 of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  Income tax treatment of employee stock com-pensation In general Employers may grant various forms of stock compensation to employees,
1076includ- ing nonstatutory and statutory stock op-tions, restricted stock, restricted stock units, and stock appreciation rights. The tax treatment of these various forms of stock compensation depends on the specific terms and conditions of the arrangement and appli-cable rules. Stock compensation treated as property trans-ferred in connection with the performance of services Section 83 generally governs the taxation of transfers of any property in connection with the performance of services by any service provider. Typically, this encompasses the transfer of stock to an employee which is subject to conditions that amount to a sub-stantial risk of forfeiture, called ‘‘restricted stock.’’ Section 83 also generally governs the taxation of nonstatutory (or nonqualified) stock options. In general, an employee’s right to stock or other property is subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture if the employ-ee’s right to full enjoyment of the property is subject to a condition, such as the future performance of substantial services.
1077 Generally, an employee must recognize in-come in the taxable year in which the em-ployee’s right to the stock is transferable or is not subject to a substantial risk of for-feiture, whichever occurs earlier (referred to herein as ‘‘substantially vested’’). Thus, if the employee’s right to the stock is substan-tially vested when the stock is transferred to the employee, the employee recognizes in-come in the taxable year of such transfer, in an amount equal to the fair market value of the stock as of the date of transfer (less any amount paid for the stock). If at the time the stock is transferred to the employee, the employee’s right to the stock is not substan-tially vested (referred to herein as ‘‘non-vested’’), the employee does not recognize in-come attributable to the stock transfer until the taxable year in which the employee’s right becomes substantially vested. In this case, the amount includible in the employ-ee’s income is the fair market value of the stock as of the date that the employee’s right to the stock is substantially vested (less any amount paid for the stock).
1078 These rules do not apply to the grant of a nonqualified option unless the option has a readily ascertainable fair market value.
1079 Instead, these rules generally apply to the transfer of employer stock by the employee on exercise of the option. That is, if the right to the stock is substantially vested on trans-fer (the time of exercise), income recognition applies for the taxable year of transfer. If the right to the stock is nonvested on transfer, the timing of income inclusion is determined under the rules applicable to the transfer of nonvested stock. In either case, the amount includible in income by the employee is the fair market value of the stock as of the re-quired time of income inclusion, less the ex-ercise price paid by the employee. Statutory stock options Two types of statutory options apply with respect to employer stock: incentive stock options (‘‘ISOs’’) and options provided under an employee stock purchase plan (‘‘ESPP’’).1080Stock received pursuant to a statutory option is subject to special rules, rather than the rules for nonqualified op-tions, discussed above. Unlike nonqualified options, statutory options may only be con-sidered as such if granted to employees.
1081 No amount is includible in an employee’s in-come on the grant, vesting, or exercise of a statutory option. If a holding requirement is met with re-spect to the stock transferred on exercise of a statutory option and the employee later disposes of the stock, the employee’s gain generally is treated as capital gain rather than ordinary income. Under the holding re-quirement, the employee must not dispose of the stock within two years after the date the option is granted and also must not dispose of the stock within one year after the date the option is exercised. If a disposition oc-curs before the end of the required holding period (a ‘‘disqualifying disposition’’), the employee recognizes ordinary income in the taxable year in which the disqualifying dis-position occurs. The amount of ordinary in-come recognized when a disqualifying dis-position occurs generally equals the fair market value of the stock on the date of ex-ercise (that is, when the stock was trans-ferred to the employee) less the exercise price paid. Stock compensation treated as deferred com-pensation A restricted stock unit (‘‘RSU’’) is a term used for an arrangement under which an em-ployee has the right to receive at a specified time in the future an amount determined by reference to the value of one or more shares of employer stock. An employee’s right to receive the future amount may be subject to a condition, such as continued employment for a certain period or the attainment of cer-tain performance goals. The payment to the employee of the amount due under the ar-rangement is referred to as settlement of the RSU. The arrangement may provide for the settlement amount to be paid in cash or as a transfer of employer stock. An arrangement providing RSUs is generally considered a nonqualified deferred compensation plan and is subject to the rules, including the limits, of section 409A,
1082unless it meets an exemp-tion from section 409A. If the RSU either is exempt from or complies with section 409A, the employee is subject to income taxation on receipt of cash or the transfer of shares attributable to the RSU. A stock appreciation right (‘‘SAR’’) is an arrangement under which an employee has the right to receive an amount (in the form of cash or stock) determined by reference to the appreciation in value of one or more shares of employer stock, based on the dif-ference in the stock’s value when the em-ployee chooses to exercise the right and the value of the stock on the date of grant of the SAR. An SAR is generally taxable at the time of exercise on the amount of cash or value of stock transferred at the time of ex-ercise of the SAR.1083 Various exemptions from section 409A apply, including transfers of property subject to section 83, such as restricted stock.
1084 Nonqualified options and SARs are not auto-matically exempt from section 409A, but may be structured so as not to be considered nonqualified deferred compensation.
1085In addition, ISOs and ESPPs are exempt from section 409A.
1086 Section 4985 excise tax on stock compensation of insiders of expatriated corporations Under section 4985, certain holders of stock options and other stock-based compensation are subject to an excise tax upon certain transactions that result in an expatriated corporation
1087(also referred to as corporate inversions).
1088The provision imposes an ex-cise tax, currently at the rate of 15 percent, on the value of specified stock compensation held (directly or indirectly) by or for the benefit of a disqualified individual, or a member of such individual’s family, at any time during the 12-month period beginning six months before the corporation’s expatria-tion date. Specified stock compensation is treated as held for the benefit of a disquali-fied individual if such compensation is held by an entity, e.g., a partnership or trust, in which the individual, or a member of the in-dividual’s family, has an ownership interest. A disqualified individual is any individual who, with respect to a corporation, is, at any time during the 12-month period beginning on the date which is six months before the expatriation date, subject to the require-ments of section 16(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 with respect to the cor-poration, or any member of the corporation’s expanded affiliated group,
1089or would be subject to such requirements if the corpora-tion (or member) were an issuer of equity se-curities referred to in section 16(a). Disquali-fied individuals generally include officers (as defined by section 16(a)),
1090directors, and 10-

The excise tax is imposed on a disqualified individual of an expatriated corporation (as defined for this purpose) only if gain is rec-ognized in whole or part by any shareholder by reason of the acquisition resulting in the corporate inversion.
1091 Specified stock compensation subject to the excise tax includes any payment (or right to payment)
1092granted by the expatri-ated corporation (or any member of the cor-poration’s expanded affiliated group) to any person in connection with the performance of services by a disqualified individual for such corporation (or member of the corpora-tion’s expanded affiliated group) if the value of the payment or right is based on, or deter-mined by reference to, the value or change in value of stock of such corporation (or any member of the corporation’s expanded affili-ated group). In determining whether such compensation exists and valuing such com-pensation, all restrictions, other than non- lapse restrictions, are ignored. Thus, the ex-cise tax applies, and the value subject to the tax is determined, without regard to whether such specified stock compensation is subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture or is exer-cisable at the time of the corporate inver-sion. Specified stock compensation includes compensatory stock and restricted stock grants, compensatory stock options, and other forms of stock-based compensation, in-cluding stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units, phantom stock, and phantom stock options. Specified stock compensation also includes nonqualified deferred com-pensation that is treated as though it were invested in stock or stock options of the ex-patriating corporation (or member). For ex-ample, the provision applies to a disqualified individual’s nonqualified deferred compensa-tion if company stock is one of the actual or deemed investment options under the non-qualified deferred compensation plan. Specified stock compensation includes a compensation arrangement that gives the disqualified individual an economic stake substantially similar to that of a corporate shareholder. A payment directly tied to the value of the stock is specified stock com-pensation. The excise tax applies to any such specified stock compensation previously granted to a disqualified individual but cancelled or cashed-out within the six-month period end-ing with the expatriation date, and to any specified stock compensation awarded in the six-month period beginning with the expa-triation date. As a result, for example, if a corporation cancels outstanding options three months before the transaction and then reissues comparable options three months after the transaction, the tax applies both to the cancelled options and the newly granted options. Specified stock compensation subject to the tax does not include a statutory stock option or any payment or right from a quali-fied retirement plan or annuity, a tax-shel-tered annuity, a simplified employee pen-sion, or a simple retirement account. In ad-dition, under the provision, the excise tax does not apply to any stock option that is exercised during the six-month period before the expatriation date or to any stock ac-quired pursuant to such exercise, if income is recognized under section 83 on or before the expatriation date with respect to the stock acquired pursuant to such exercise. The ex-cise tax also does not apply to any specified stock compensation that is exercised, sold, exchanged, distributed, cashed out, or other-wise paid during such period in a transaction in which income, gain, or loss is recognized in full. For specified stock compensation held on the expatriation date, the amount of the tax is determined based on the value of the com-pensation on such date. The tax imposed on specified stock compensation cancelled dur-ing the six-month period before the expatria-tion date is determined based on the value of the compensation on the day before such cancellation, while specified stock com-pensation granted after the expatriation date is valued on the date granted. Under the provision, the cancellation of a non-lapse re-striction is treated as a grant. The value of the specified stock compensa-tion on which the excise tax is imposed is the fair value in the case of stock options (including warrants and other similar rights to acquire stock) and stock appreciation rights and the fair market value for all other forms of compensation. For purposes of the tax, the fair value of an option (or a warrant or other similar right to acquire stock) or a stock appreciation right is determined using an appropriate option-pricing model, as spec-ified or permitted by the Treasury Sec-retary, that takes into account the stock price at the valuation date; the exercise price under the option; the remaining term of the option; the volatility of the under-lying stock and the expected dividends on it; and the risk-free interest rate over the re-maining term of the option. Options that have no intrinsic value (or ‘‘spread’’) because the exercise price under the option equals or exceeds the fair market value of the stock at valuation nevertheless have a fair value and are subject to tax under the provision. The value of other forms of compensation, such as phantom stock or restricted stock, is the fair market value of the stock as of the date of the expatriation transaction. The value of any deferred compensation that can be val-ued by reference to stock is the amount that the disqualified individual would receive if the plan were to distribute all such deferred compensation in a single sum on the date of the expatriation transaction (or the date of cancellation or grant, if applicable). The excise tax also applies to any payment by the expatriated corporation or any mem-ber of the expanded affiliated group made to an individual, directly or indirectly, in re-spect of the tax. Whether a payment is made in respect of the tax is determined under all of the facts and circumstances. Any payment made to keep the individual in the same after-tax position that the individual would have been in had the tax not applied is a pay-ment made in respect of the tax. This in-cludes direct payments of the tax and pay-ments to reimburse the individual for pay-ment of the tax. Any payment made in re-spect of the tax is includible in the income of the individual, but is not deductible by the corporation. To the extent that a disqualified individual is also a covered employee under section 162(m), the limit on the deduction allowed for employee remuneration for such em-ployee is reduced by the amount of any pay-ment (including reimbursements) made in respect of the tax under the provision. As discussed above, this includes direct pay-ments of the tax and payments to reimburse the individual for payment of the tax. The payment of the excise tax has no effect on the subsequent tax treatment of any spec-ified stock compensation. Thus, the payment of the tax has no effect on the individual’s basis in any specified stock compensation and no effect on the tax treatment for the in-dividual at the time of exercise of an option or payment of any specified stock compensa-tion, or at the time of any lapse or forfeiture of such specified stock compensation. The payment of the tax is not deductible and has no effect on any deduction that might be al-lowed at the time of any future exercise or payment. HOUSE BILL  No provision. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The provision increases the 15 percent rate of excise tax, imposed on the value of stock compensation held by insiders of an expatri-ated corporation, to 20 percent. Effective date.—The provision applies to corporations first becoming expatriated cor-porations after the date of enactment. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the Sen-ate amendment. J. Other Provisions 1. Treatment of gain or loss of foreign per-sons from sale or exchange of interests in partnerships engaged in trade or busi-ness within the United States (sec. 13501 of the Senate amendment and secs. 864(c) and 1446 of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  In general A partnership generally is not treated as a taxable entity, but rather, income of the partnership is taken into account on the tax returns of the partners. The character (as capital or ordinary) of partnership items passes through to the partners as if the items were realized directly by the part-ners.
1093A partner holding a partnership in-terest includes in income its distributive share (whether or not actually distributed) of partnership items of income and gain, in-cluding capital gain eligible for the lower tax rates, and deducts its distributive share of partnership items of deduction and loss. A partner’s basis in the partnership interest is increased by any amount of gain and de-creased by ay amount of losses thus in-cluded. These basis adjustments prevent dou-ble taxation of partnership income to the partner. Money distributed to the partner by the partnership is taxed to the extent the amount exceeds the partner’s basis in the partnership interest. Gain or loss from the sale or exchange of a partnership interest generally is treated as gain or loss from the sale or exchange of a capital asset.
1094However, the amount of money and the fair market value of property received in the exchange that represent the partner’s share of certain ordinary income- producing assets of the partnership give rise to ordinary income rather than capital gain.
1095In general, a partnership does not adjust the basis of partnership property fol-lowing the transfer of a partnership interest unless either the partnership has made a one-time election to do so,
1096or the partner-ship has a substantial built-in loss imme-diately after the transfer.
1097If an election is in effect or the partnership has a substantial built-in loss immediately after the transfer, adjustments are made with respect to the transferee partner. These adjustments are to account for the difference between the trans-feree partner’s proportionate share of the ad-justed basis of the partnership property and the transferee partner’s basis in its partner-ship interest.
1098The effect of the adjust-ments on the basis of partnership property is

1100Any gross income derived by the foreign person that is not effectively con-nected with the person’s U.S. business is not taken into account in determining the rates of U.S. tax applicable to the person’s income from the business.
1101 Among the factors taken into account in determining whether income, gain, or loss is effectively connected gain or loss are the ex-tent to which the income, gain, or loss is de-rived from assets used in or held for use in the conduct of the U.S. trade or business and whether the activities of the trade or busi-ness were a material factor in the realization of the income, gain, or loss (the ‘‘asset use’’ and ‘‘business activities’’ tests).
1102In deter- mining whether the asset use or business ac-tivities tests are met, due regard is given to whether such assets or such income, gain, or loss were accounted for through such trade or business. Thus, notwithstanding the gen-eral rule that source of gain or loss from the sale or exchange of personal property is gen-erally determined by the residence of the seller,
1103a foreign partner may have effec-tively connected income by reason of the asset use or business activities of the part-nership in which he is an investor. Special rules apply to treat gain or loss from disposition of U.S. real property inter-ests as effectively connected with the con-duct of a U.S. trade or business.
1104To the extent that consideration received by the nonresident alien or foreign corporation for all or part of its interest in a partnership is attributable to a U.S. real property interest, that consideration is considered to be re-ceived from the sale or exchange in the United States of such property.
1105In certain circumstances, gain attributable to sales of U.S. real property interests may be subject to withholding tax of ten percent of the amount realized on the transfer.
1106 Under a 1991 revenue ruling, in deter-mining the source of gain or loss from the sale or exchange of an interest in a foreign partnership, the IRS applied the asset-use test and business activities test at the part-nership level to determine the extent to which income derived from the sale or ex-change is effectively connected with that U.S. business. 
1107Under the ruling, if there is unrealized gain or loss in partnership as-sets that would be treated as effectively con-nected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business if those assets were sold by the partnership, some or all of the foreign per-son’s gain or loss from the sale or exchange of a partnership interest may be treated as effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business. However, a 2017 Tax Court case rejects the logic of the ruling and instead holds that, generally, gain or loss on sale or exchange by a foreign person of an in-terest in a partnership that is engaged in a U.S. trade or business is foreign-source.1108 
HOUSE BILL  No provision. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  Under the provision, gain or loss from the sale or exchange of a partnership interest is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business to the extent that the transferor would have had effectively connected gain or loss had the partnership sold all of its assets at fair market value as of the date of the sale or exchange. The provision requires that any gain or loss from the hypothetical asset sale by the partnership be allocated to inter-ests in the partnership in the same manner as nonseparately stated income and loss. The provision also requires the transferee of a partnership interest to withhold 10 per-cent of the amount realized on the sale or ex-change of a partnership interest unless the transferor certifies that the transferor is not a nonresident alien individual or foreign cor-poration. If the transferee fails to withhold the correct amount, the partnership is re-quired to deduct and withhold from distribu-tions to the transferee partner an amount equal to the amount the transferee failed to withhold. The provision provides the Secretary of the Treasury with specific regulatory authority to address coordination with the nonrecogni-tion provisions of the Code. Effective date.—The provision is effective for sales and exchanges on or after November 27, 2017. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement generally fol-lows the Senate amendment. The conference agreement modifies the grant of authority to the Secretary of the Treasury to make clear that the Secretary shall issues such regula-tions as the Secretary determines appro-priate for the application of the paragraph, including in exchanges described in sections 332, 351, 354, 355, 356, or 361. The conference agreement also provides that the provisions related to withholding are effective for sales and exchanges after December 31, 2017. Addi-tionally, the conferees intend that, under regulatory authority provided by the Senate amendment to carry out withholding re-quirements of the provision, the Secretary may provide guidance permitting a broker, as agent of the transferee, to deduct and withhold the tax equal to 10 percent of the amount realized on the disposition of a part-nership interest to which the provision ap-plies. For example, such guidance may pro-vide that if an interest in a publicly traded partnership is sold by a foreign partner through a broker, the broker may deduct and withhold the 10-percent tax on behalf of the transferee. Effective date.—The portion of the provision treating gain or loss on sale of a partnership interest as effectively connected income is effective for sales, exchanges, and disposi-tions on or after November 27, 2017. The por-tion of the provision requiring withholding on sales or exchanges of partnership inter-ests is effective for sales, exchanges, and dis-positions after December 31, 2017. 2. Modification of the definition of substan-tial built-in loss in the case of transfer of partnership interest (sec. 13502 of the Senate amendment and sec. 743 of the Code) PRESENT LAW  In general, a partnership does not adjust the basis of partnership property following the transfer of a partnership interest unless either the partnership has made a one-time election under section 754 to make basis ad-justments, or the partnership has a substan-tial built-in loss immediately after the transfer.
1109 If an election is in effect, or if the partner-ship has a substantial built-in loss imme-diately after the transfer, adjustments are made with respect to the transferee partner. These adjustments are to account for the dif-ference between the transferee partner’s pro-portionate share of the adjusted basis of the partnership property and the transferee’s basis in its partnership interest.
1110The ad- justments are intended to adjust the basis of partnership property to approximate the re-sult of a direct purchase of the property by the transferee partner. Under the provision, a substantial built-in loss exists if the partnership’s adjusted basis in its property exceeds by more than $250,000 the fair market value of the partnership property.
1111Certain securitization partner-ships and electing investment partnerships are not treated as having a substantial built- in loss in certain instances, and thus are not required to make basis adjustments to part-nership property.
1112For electing investment partnerships, in lieu of the partnership basis adjustments, a partner-level loss limitation rule applies.
1113 
HOUSE BILL  No provision. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The provision modifies the definition of a substantial built-in loss for purposes of sec-tion 743(d), affecting transfers of partnership interests. Under the provision, in addition to the present-law definition, a substantial built-in loss also exists if the transferee would be allocated a net loss in excess of $250,000 upon a hypothetical disposition by the partnership of all partnership’s assets in a fully taxable transaction for cash equal to the assets’ fair market value, immediately after the transfer of the partnership interest. For example, a partnership of three tax-able partners (partners A, B, and C) has not made an election pursuant to section 754. The partnership has two assets, one of which, Asset X, has a built-in gain of $1 million, while the other asset, Asset Y, has a built-in loss of $900,000. Pursuant to the partnership agreement, any gain on sale or exchange of Asset X is specially allocated to partner A. The three partners share equally in all other partnership items, including in the built-in loss in Asset Y. In this case, each of partner B and partner C has a net built-in loss of $300,000 (one third of the loss attributable to asset Y) allocable to his partnership interest. Nevertheless, the partnership does not have an overall built-in loss, but a net built-in gain of $100,000 ($1 million minus $900,000). Partner C sells his partnership interest to another person, D, for $33,333. Under the pro-vision, the test for a substantial built-in loss applies both at the partnership level and at

If the partner-ship were to sell all its assets for cash at their fair market value immediately after the transfer to D, D would be allocated a loss of $300,000 (one third of the built-in loss of $900,000 in Asset Y). A substantial built-in loss exists under the partner-level test added by the provision, and the partnership adjusts the basis of its assets accordingly with re-spect to D. Effective date.—The provision applies to transfers of partnership interests after De-cember 31, 2017. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the Sen-ate amendment. Effective date.—The provision applies to transfers of partnership interests after De-cember 31, 2017. 3. Charitable contributions and foreign taxes taken into account in determining limita-tion on allowance of partner’s share of loss (sec. 13503 of the Senate amendment and sec. 704 of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  A partner’s distributive share of partner-ship loss (including capital loss) is allowed only to the extent of the adjusted basis (be-fore reduction by current year’s losses) of the partner’s interest in the partnership at the end of the partnership taxable year in which the loss occurred. Any disallowed loss is allowable as a deduction at the end of the first succeeding partnership taxable year, and subsequent taxable years, to the extent that the partner’s adjusted basis for its part-nership interest at the end of any such year exceeds zero (before reduction by the loss for the year).
1114 A partner’s basis in its partnership inter-est is increased by its distributive share of income (including tax exempt income). A partner’s basis in its partnership interest is decreased (but not below zero) by distribu-tions by the partnership and its distributive share of partnership losses and expenditures of the partnership not deductible in com-puting partnership taxable income and not properly chargeable to capital account.
1115In the case of a charitable contribution, a part-ner’s basis is reduced by the partner’s dis-tributive share of the adjusted basis of the contributed property.
1116 A partnership computes its taxable income in the same manner as an individual with certain exceptions. The exceptions provide, in part, that the deductions for foreign taxes and charitable contributions are not allowed to the partnership.
1117Instead, a partner takes into account its distributive share of the foreign taxes paid by the partnership and the charitable contributions made by the partnership for the taxable year.
1118 However, in applying the basis limitation on partner losses, Treasury regulations do not take into account the partner’s share of partnership charitable contributions and for-eign taxes paid or accrued.
1119The IRS has taken the position in a private letter ruling that the basis limitation on partner losses does not apply to limit the partner’s deduc-tion for its share of the partnership’s chari-table contributions.1120While the regulations relating to the loss limitation do not men-tion the foreign tax credit, a taxpayer may choose the foreign tax credit in lieu of de-ducting foreign taxes.
1121 By contrast, under S corporation rules lim-iting the losses and deductions which may be taken into account by a shareholder of an S corporation to the shareholder’s basis in stock and debt of the corporation, the share-holder’s pro rata share of charitable con-tributions and foreign taxes are taken into account.
1122In the case of charitable con-tributions, a special rule is provided pro-rating the amount of appreciation not sub-ject to the limitation in the case of chari-table contributions of appreciated property by the S corporation.
1123 
HOUSE BILL  No provision. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The provision modifies the basis limitation on partner losses to provide that the limita-tion takes into account a partner’s distribu-tive share of partnership charitable con-tributions (as defined in section 170(c)) and taxes (described in section 901) paid or ac-crued to foreign countries and to possessions of the United States. Thus, the amount of the basis limitation on partner losses is de-creased to reflect these items. In the case of a charitable contribution by the partnership, the amount of the basis limitation on part-ner losses is decreased by the partner’s dis-tributive share of the adjusted basis of the contributed property. In the case of a chari-table contribution by the partnership of property whose fair market value exceeds its adjusted basis, a special rule provides that the basis limitation on partner losses does not apply to the extent of the partner’s dis-tributive share of the excess. Effective date.—The provision applies to partnership taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the Sen-ate amendment. Effective date.—The provision applies to partnership taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 4. Cost basis of specified securities deter-mined without regard to identification (sec. 13533 of the Senate amendment and sec. 1012 of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  In general Gain or loss generally is recognized for Federal income tax purposes on realization of that gain or loss (for example, as the re-sult of sale of property). The taxpayer’s gain or loss on a disposition of property is the dif-ference between the amount realized on the sale and the taxpayer’s adjusted basis in the property disposed of.1124 To compute adjusted basis, a taxpayer must first determine the property’s unadjusted or original basis and then make adjustments prescribed by the Code.
1125The original basis of property is its cost, except as otherwise prescribed by the Code (for ex-ample, in the case of property acquired by gift or bequest or in a tax-free exchange). Once determined, the taxpayer’s original basis generally is adjusted downward to take account of depreciation or amortization, and generally is adjusted upward to reflect in-come and gain inclusions or capital improve-ments with respect to the property. Basis computation rules If a taxpayer has acquired stock in a cor-poration on different dates or at different prices and sells or transfers some of the shares of that stock, and the lot from which the stock is sold or transferred is not ade-quately identified, the shares sold are deemed to be drawn from the earliest ac-quired shares (the ‘‘first-in-first-out rule’’).
1126However, if a taxpayer makes an adequate identification (‘‘specific identifica-tion’’) of shares of stock that it sells, the shares of stock treated as sold are the shares that have been identified.
1127A taxpayer who owns shares in a regulated investment com-pany (‘‘RIC’’) generally is permitted to elect, in lieu of the specific identification or first- in-first-out methods, to determine the basis of RIC shares sold under one of two average- cost-basis methods described in Treasury regulations (together, the ‘‘average basis method’’).
1128 In the case of the sale, exchange, or other disposition of a specified security (defined below) to which the basis reporting require-ment described below applies, the first-in- first-out rule, specific identification, and av-erage basis method conventions are applied on an account by account basis.
1129To facili- tate the determination of the cost of RIC stock under the average basis method, RIC stock acquired before January 1, 2012, gen-erally is treated as a separate account from RIC stock acquired on or after that date un-less the RIC (or a broker holding the stock as a nominee) elects otherwise with respect to one or more of its stockholders, in which case all the RIC stock with respect to which the election is made is treated as a single ac-count and the basis reporting requirement described below applies to all that stock.
1130 The basis of stock acquired after December 31, 2010, in connection with a dividend rein-vestment plan (‘‘DRP’’) is determined under the average basis method for as long as the stock is held as part of that plan.
1131 Basis reporting A broker is required to report to the IRS a customer’s adjusted basis in a covered secu-rity that the customer has sold and whether any gain or loss from the sale is long-term or short-term.
1132 A covered security is, in general, any spec-ified security acquired after an applicable date specified in the basis reporting rules. A specified security is any share of stock of a corporation (including stock of a RIC); any note, bond, debenture, or other evidence of

1146Sec. 263A(b)(2)(B). No statutory exception is available for small taxpayers who produce property subject to section 263A. However, a de minimis rule under Treasury regulations treats producers that use the simplified production method and incur total indirect costs of $200,000 or less in a taxable year as having no additional indirect costs beyond those normally capitalized for financial accounting purposes.

HOUSE BILL  No provision. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The provision requires that the cost of any specified security sold, exchanged, or other-wise disposed of on or after January 1, 2018, be determined on a first-in first-out basis ex-cept to the extent the average basis method is otherwise allowed (as in the case of a tax-payer holding shares in a RIC). The provision does not apply to sales, exchanges, or other dispositions of specified securities by RICs. The provision includes several conforming amendments, including a rule restricting a broker’s basis reporting method to the first- in first-out method in the case of the sale of any stock for which the average basis meth-od is not permitted. Effective date.—The provision applies to sales, exchanges, and other dispositions after December 31, 2017. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement does not include the Senate amendment provision. 5. Expansion of qualifying beneficiaries of an electing small business trust (sec. 13541 of the Senate amendment and sec. 1361 of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  An electing small business trust (‘‘ESBT’’) may be a shareholder of an S corporation.
1134 Generally, the eligible beneficiaries of an ESBT include individuals, estates, and cer-tain charitable organizations eligible to hold S corporation stock directly. A nonresident alien individual may not be a shareholder of an S corporation and may not be a potential current beneficiary of an ESBT.
1135 The portion of an ESBT which consists of the stock of an S corporation is treated as a separate trust and generally is taxed on its share of the S corporation’s income at the highest rate of tax imposed on individual taxpayers. This income (whether or not dis-tributed by the ESBT) is not taxed to the beneficiaries of the ESBT. 
HOUSE BILL  No provision. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The Senate amendment allows a non-resident alien individual to be a potential current beneficiary of an ESBT. Effective date.—The provision takes effect on January 1, 2018. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the Sen-ate amendment. 6. Charitable contribution deduction for electing small business trusts (sec. 13542 of the Senate amendment and sec. 642(c) of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  An electing small business trust (‘‘ESBT’’) may be a shareholder of an S corporation.
1136 The portion of an ESBT that consists of the stock of an S corporation is treated as a sep-arate trust and generally is taxed on its share of the S corporation’s income at the highest rate of tax imposed on individual taxpayers. This income (whether or not dis-tributed by the ESBT) is not taxed to the beneficiaries of the ESBT. In addition to nonseparately computed income or loss, an S corporation reports to its shareholders their pro rata share of certain separately stated items of income, loss, deduction, and cred-it.1137For this purpose, charitable contribu-tions (as defined in section 170(c)) of an S corporation are separately stated and taken by the shareholder. The treatment of a charitable contribution passed through by an S corporation depends on the shareholder. Because an ESBT is a trust, the deduction for charitable contribu-tions applicable to trusts,
1138rather than the deduction applicable to individuals,
1139ap- plies to the trust. Generally, a trust is al-lowed a charitable contribution deduction for amounts of gross income, without limita-tion, which pursuant to the terms of the gov-erning instrument are paid for a charitable purpose. No carryover of excess contribu-tions is allowed. An individual is allowed a charitable contribution deduction limited to certain percentages of adjusted gross income generally with a five-year carryforward of amounts in excess of this limitation. 
HOUSE BILL  No provision. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The Senate amendment provides that the charitable contribution deduction of an ESBT is not determined by the rules gen-erally applicable to trusts but rather by the rules applicable to individuals. Thus, the percentage limitations and carryforward pro-visions applicable to individuals apply to charitable contributions made by the portion of an ESBT holding S corporation stock. Effective date.—The provision applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the Sen-ate amendment. 7. Production period for beer, wine, and dis-tilled spirits (sec. 13801 of the Senate amendment and sec. 263A of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  In general The uniform capitalization (‘‘UNICAP’’) rules, which were enacted as part of the Tax Reform Act of 1986,
1140require certain direct and indirect costs allocable to real or tan-gible personal property produced by the tax-payer to be included in either inventory or capitalized into the basis of such property, as applicable.
1141For real or personal prop-erty acquired by the taxpayer for resale, sec-tion 263A generally requires certain direct and indirect costs allocable to such property to be included in inventory. In the case of interest expense, the UNICAP rules apply only to interest paid or incurred during the property’s production period
1142and that is allocable to property produced by the taxpayer or acquired for re-sale which (1) is either real property or prop-erty with a class life of at least 20 years, (2) has an estimated production period exceed-ing two years, or (3) has an estimated pro-duction period exceeding one year and a cost exceeding $1,000,000.
1143The production pe-riod with respect to any property is the pe-riod beginning on the date on which produc-tion of the property begins, and ending on the date on which the property is ready to be placed in service or held for sale.1144In the case of property that is customarily aged (e.g., tobacco, wine, and whiskey) before it is sold, the production period includes the aging period.
1145 Exceptions from UNICAP Section 263A provides a number of excep-tions to the general capitalization require-ments. One such exception exists for certain small taxpayers who acquire property for re-sale and have $10 million or less of average annual gross receipts for the preceding three-taxable year period;
1146such taxpayers are not required to include additional sec-tion 263A costs in inventory. Another exception exists for taxpayers who raise, harvest, or grow trees.
1147Under this exception, section 263A does not apply to trees raised, harvested, or grown by the tax-payer (other than trees bearing fruit, nuts, or other crops, or ornamental trees) and any real property underlying such trees. Simi-larly, the UNICAP rules do not apply to any animal or plant having a reproductive period of two years or less, which is produced by a taxpayer in a farming business (unless the taxpayer is required to use an accrual meth-od of accounting under section 447 or 448(a)(3)).
1148 Freelance authors, photographers, and art-ists also are exempt from section 263A for any qualified creative expenses.
1149Qualified creative expenses are defined as amounts paid or incurred by an individual in the trade or business of being a writer, photographer, or artist. However, such term does not in-clude any expense related to printing, photo-graphic plates, motion picture files, video tapes, or similar items. 
HOUSE BILL  No provision. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The Senate amendment would exclude the aging periods for beer, wine, and distilled spirits from the production period for pur-poses of the UNICAP interest capitalization rules. Thus, under the provision, producers of beer, wine and distilled spirits are able to deduct interest expenses (subject to any other applicable limitation) attributable to a shorter production period. The provision does not apply to interest costs paid or accrued after December 31, 2019.

CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the Sen-ate amendment. 8. Reduced rate of excise tax on beer (sec. 13802 of the Senate amendment and sec. 5051 of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  Federal excise taxes are imposed at dif-ferent rates on distilled spirits, wine, and beer and are imposed on these products when produced or imported. Generally, these ex-cise taxes are administered and enforced by the TTB, except the taxes on imported bot-tled distilled spirits, wine, and beer are col-lected by the Customs and Border Protection Bureau (the ‘‘CBP’’) of the Department of Homeland Security (under delegation by the Secretary of the Treasury). Liability for the excise tax on beer also come into existence when the alcohol is pro-duced but is not payable until the beer is re-moved from the brewery for consumption or sale. Generally, beer may be transferred be-tween commonly owned breweries without payment of tax; however, tax liability fol-lows these products. Imported bulk beer may be released from customs custody without payment of tax and transferred in bond to a brewery. Beer may be exported without pay-ment of tax and may be withdrawn without payment of tax or free of tax from the pro-duction facility for certain authorized uses, including industrial uses and non-beverage uses. The rate of tax on beer is $18 per barrel (31 gallons).
1150Small brewers are subject to a reduced tax rate of $7 per barrel on the first 60,000 barrels of beer domestically produced and removed each year.
1151Small brewers are defined as brewers producing fewer than two million barrels of beer during a calendar year. The credit reduces the effective per- gallon tax rate from approximately 58 cents per gallon to approximately 22.6 cents per gallon for this beer. In the case of a controlled group, the two million barrel limitation for small brewers is applied to the controlled group, and the 60,000 barrels eligible for the reduced rate of tax, are apportioned among the brewers who are component members of such group. The term ‘‘controlled group’’ has the meaning as-signed to it by sec. 1563(a), except that the phrase ‘‘more than 50 percent’’ is substituted for the phrase ‘‘at least 80 percent’’ in each place it appears in sec. 1563(a). Individuals may produce limited quantities of beer for personal or family use without payment of tax during each calendar year. The limit is 200 gallons per calendar year for households of two or more adults and 100 gal-lons per calendar year for single-adult house-holds. 
HOUSE BILL  No provision. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The Senate amendment lowers the rate of tax on beer to $16 per barrel on the first six million barrels brewed by the brewer or im-ported by the importer. In general, in the case of a controlled group of brewers, the six million barrel limitation is applied and ap-portioned at the level of the controlled group. Beer brewed or imported in excess of the six million barrel limit would continue to be taxed at $18 per barrel. In the case of small brewers, such brewers would be taxed at a rate of $3.50 per barrel on the first 60,000 barrels domestically produced, and $16 per barrel on any further barrels produced. The same rules applicable to controlled groups under present law apply with respect to this limitation. For barrels of beer that have been brewed or produced outside of the United States and imported into the United States, the reduced tax rate may be assigned by the brewer to any importer of such barrels pursuant to re-quirements set forth by the Secretary of the Treasury in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Sec-retary of the Department of Homeland Secu-rity. These requirements are to include: (1) a limitation to ensure that the number of bar-rels of beer for which the reduced tax rate has been assigned by a brewer to any im-porter does not exceed the number of barrels of beer brewed or produced by such brewer during the calendar year which were im-ported into the United States by such im-porter; (2) procedures that allow a brewer and an importer to elect whether to receive the reduced tax rate; (3) requirements that the brewer provide any information as the Secretary of the Treasury determines nec-essary and appropriate for purposes of as-signment of the reduced tax rate; and (4) pro-cedures that allow for revocation of eligi-bility of the brewer and the importer for the reduced tax rate in the case of erroneous or fraudulent information provided in (3) which the Secretary of the Treasury deems to be material for qualifying for the reduced tax rate. Any importer making an election to re-ceive the reduced tax rate shall be deemed to be a member of the controlled group of the brewer, within the meaning of sec. 1563(a), except that the phrase ‘‘more than 50 per-cent’’ is substituted for the phrase ‘‘at least 80 percent’’ in each place it appears in sec 1563(a).1152 Under rules issued by the Secretary of the Treasury, two or more entities (whether or not under common control) that produce beer marketed under a similar brand, li-cense, franchise, or other arrangement shall be treated as a single taxpayer for purposes of the excise tax on beer. The provision does not apply for beer re-moved after December 31, 2019. Effective date.—The provision is effective for beer removed after December 31, 2017. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the Sen-ate amendment. 9. Transfer of beer between bonded facilities (sec. 13803 of the Senate amendment and sec. 5414 of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  Federal excise taxes are imposed at dif-ferent rates on distilled spirits, wine, and beer and are imposed on these products when produced or imported. Generally, these ex-cise taxes are administered and enforced by the TTB, except the taxes on imported bot-tled distilled spirits, wine, and beer are col-lected by the Customs and Border Protection Bureau (the ‘‘CBP’’) of the Department of Homeland Security (under delegation by the Secretary of the Treasury). The rate of tax on beer is $18 per barrel (31 gallons).
1153 Liability for the excise tax on beer also come into existence when the alcohol is pro-duced but is not payable until the beer is re-moved from the brewery for consumption or sale. Generally, beer may be transferred be-tween commonly owned breweries without payment of tax; however, tax liability fol-lows these products. Imported bulk beer may be released from customs custody without payment of tax and transferred in bond to a brewery. Beer may be exported without pay-ment of tax and may be withdrawn without payment of tax or free of tax from the pro-duction facility for certain authorized uses, including industrial uses and non-beverage uses. Small domestic brewers are subject to a re-duced tax rate of $7 per barrel on the first 60,000 barrels of beer removed each year.1154 Small brewers are defined as brewers pro-ducing fewer than two million barrels of beer during a calendar year. The credit reduces the effective per-gallon tax rate from ap-proximately 58 cents per gallon to approxi-mately 22.6 cents per gallon for this beer. Individuals may produce limited quantities of beer for personal or family use without payment of tax during each calendar year. The limit is 200 gallons per calendar year for households of two or more adults and 100 gal-lons per calendar year for single-adult house-holds. Transfer rules and removals without tax Certain removals or transfers of beer are exempt from tax. Beer may be transferred without payment of the tax between bonded premises under certain conditions specified in the regulations.
1155The tax liability ac-companies the beer that is transferred in bond. However, beer may only be transferred free of tax between breweries if both brew-eries are owned by the same brewer. 
HOUSE BILL  No provision. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The Senate amendment relaxes the shared ownership requirement of section 5414. Thus, under the provision, a brewer may transfer beer from one brewery to another without incurring tax, provided that: (i) the brew-eries are owned by the same person; (ii) one brewery owns a controlling interest in the other; (iii) the same person or persons have a controlling interest in both breweries; or (iv) the proprietors of the transferring and receiving premises are independent of each other, and the transferor has divested itself of all interest in the beer so transferred, and the transferee has accepted responsibility for payment of the tax. For purposes of transferring the tax liabil-ity pursuant to (iv) above, such relief from liability shall be effective from the time of removal from the transferor’s bonded prem-ises, or from the time of divestment, which-ever is later. The provision does not apply for calendar quarters beginning after December 31, 2019. Effective date.—The provision applies to any calendar quarters beginning after De-cember 31, 2017. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the Sen-ate amendment. 10. Reduced rate of excise tax on certain wine (sec. 13804 of the Senate amend-ment and sec. 5041 of the Code)

Liability for the excise taxes on wine come into existence when the wine is produced but is not payable until the wine is removed from the bonded wine cellar or winery for consumption or sale. Generally, bulk and bottled wine may be transferred in bond be-tween bonded premises; however, tax liabil-ity follows these products. Bulk natural wine may be released from customs custody with-out payment of tax and transferred in bond to a winery. Wine may be exported without payment of tax and may be withdrawn with-out payment of tax or free of tax from the production facility for certain authorized uses, including industrial uses and non-bev-erage uses. Reduced rates and exemptions for certain wine producers Wineries having aggregate annual produc-tion not exceeding 250,000 gallons (‘‘small do-mestic producers’’) receive a credit against the wine excise tax equal to 90 cents per gal-lon (the amount of a wine tax increase en-acted in 1990) on the first 100,000 gallons of wine domestically produced and removed during a calendar year.
1158The credit is re-duced (but not below zero) by one percent for each 1,000 gallons produced in excess of 150,000 gallons; the credit does not apply to sparkling wines. In the case of a controlled group, the 250,000 gallon limitation for wineries is applied to the controlled group, and the 100,000 gallons eligible for the credit, are apportioned among the wineries who are component members of such group. The term ‘‘controlled group’’ has the meaning assigned to it by sec. 1563(a), except that the phrase ‘‘more than 50 percent’’ is substituted for the phrase ‘‘at least 80 percent’’ in each place it appears in sec 1563(a). Individuals may produce limited quantities of wine for personal or family use without payment of tax during each calendar year. The limit is 200 gallons per calendar year for households of two or more adults and 100 gal-lons per calendar year for single-adult house-holds. 
HOUSE BILL  No provision. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The Senate amendment modifies the credit against the wine excise tax for small domes-tic producers, by removing the 250,000 wine gallon domestic production limitation (and thus making the credit available for all wine producers and importers). Additionally, under the provision, sparkling wine pro-ducers and importers are now eligible for the credit. With respect to wine produced in, or imported into, the United States during a calendar year, the credit amount is (1) $1.00 per wine gallon for the first 30,000 wine gal-lons of wine, plus; (2) 90 cents per wine gallon on the next 100,000 wine gallons of wine, plus; (3) 53.5 cents per wine gallon on the next 620,000 wine gallons of wine.
1159There is no phaseout of the credit. In the case of any wine gallons of wine that have been produced outside of the United States and imported into the United States, the tax credit allowable may be as-signed by the person who produced such wine (the ‘‘foreign producer’’) to any electing im-porter of such wine gallons pursuant to re-quirements established by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Sec-retary of Health and Human Services and the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. These requirement are to include: (1) a limitation to ensure that the number of wine gallons of wine for which the tax credit has been assigned by a foreign producer to any importer does not exceed the number of wine gallons of wine produced by such for-eign producer, during the calendar year, which were imported into the United States by such importer; (2) procedures that allow the election of a foreign producer to assign, and an importer to receive, the tax credit; (3) requirements that the foreign producer pro-vide any information that the Secretary of the Treasury determines to be necessary and appropriate for purposes of assigning the tax credit; and (4) procedures that allow for rev-ocation of eligibility of the foreign producer and the importer for the tax credit in the case of erroneous or fraudulent information provided in (3) which the Secretary of the Treasury deems to be material for qualifying for the reduced tax rate. Any importer making an election to re-ceive the reduced tax rate shall be deemed to be a member of the controlled group of the winemaker, within the meaning of sec. 1563(a), except that the phrase ‘‘more than 50 percent’’ is substitute for the phrase ‘‘at least 80 percent’’ in each place it appears in sec 1563(a).1160 The provision does not apply for wine re-moved in calendar quarters beginning after December 31, 2019. Effective date.—The provision applies to wine removed after December 31, 2017.

SENATE AMENDMENT  The Senate amendment designates mead and certain sparkling wines to be taxed at the lowest rate applicable to ‘‘still wine,’’ of $1.07 per wine gallon of wine. Mead is defined as a wine that contains not more than 0.64 grams of carbon dioxide per hundred milli-liters of wine,
1167which is derived solely from honey and water, contains no fruit product or fruit flavoring, and contains less than 8.5 percent alcohol-by-volume. The sparkling wines eligible to be taxed at the lowest rate are those wines that contain not more than 0.64 grams of carbon dioxide per hundred milliliters of wine,
1168which are de-rived primarily from grapes or grape juice concentrate and water, which contain no fruit flavoring other than grape, and which contain less than 8.5 percent alcohol by vol-ume.

CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the Sen-ate amendment. 13. Reduced rate of excise tax on certain dis-tilled spirits (sec. 13807 of the Senate amendment and sec. 5001 of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  An excise tax is imposed on all distilled spirits produced in, or imported into, the United States.
1169The tax liability legally comes into existence the moment the alco-hol is produced or imported but payment of the tax is not required until a subsequent withdrawal or removal from the distillery, or, in the case of an imported product, from customs custody or bond.
1170 Distilled spirits are taxed at a rate of $13.50 per proof gallon.
1171Liability for the excise tax on distilled spirits comes into existence when the alcohol is produced but is not de-termined and payable until bottled distilled spirits are removed from the bonded prem-ises of the distilled spirits plant where they are produced. Generally, bulk distilled spir-its may be transferred in bond between bond-ed premises; however, tax liability follows these products. Imported bulk distilled spir-its may be released from customs custody without payment of tax and transferred in bond to a distillery. Distilled spirits be ex-ported without payment of tax and may be withdrawn without payment of tax or free of tax from the production facility for certain authorized uses, including industrial uses and non-beverage uses. A portion of the revenues from the dis-tilled spirits excise tax imposed on rum im-ported or brought into
1172the United States (less certain administrative costs) is trans-ferred (‘‘covered over’’) to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
1173The amount cov-ered over is $10.50 per proof gallon ($13.25 per proof gallon during the period from July 1, 1999, through December 31, 2016). Eligible distilled spirits wholesale distribu-tors and distillers receive an income tax credit for the average cost of carrying pre-viously imposed excise tax on beverages stored in their warehouses.
1174 
HOUSE BILL  No provision. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The Senate amendment institutes a tiered rate for distilled spirits. The rate of tax is lowered to $2.70 per proof gallon on the first 100,000 proof gallons of distilled spirits, $13.34 for all proof gallons in excess of that amount but below 22,130,000 proof gallons, and $13.50 for amounts thereafter. The provision con-tains rules so as to prevent members of the same controlled group from receiving the lower rate on more than 100,000 proof gallons of distilled spirits. Importers of distilled spirits are eligible for the lower rates. The provision does not apply to distilled spirits removed after December 31, 2019. Effective date.—The provision applies to distilled spirits removed after December 31, 2017. CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the Sen-ate amendment. 14. Bulk distilled spirits (sec. 13808 of the Senate amendment and sec. 5212 of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  An excise tax is imposed on all distilled spirits produced in, or imported into, the United States.
1175The tax liability legally comes into existence the moment the alco-hol is produced or imported but payment of the tax is not required until a subsequent withdrawal or removal from the distillery, or, in the case of an imported product, from customs custody or bond.
1176 Distilled spirits are taxed at a rate of $13.50 per proof gallon.
1177Liability for the excise tax on distilled spirits comes into existence when the alcohol is produced but is not de-termined and payable until bottled distilled spirits are removed from the bonded prem-ises of the distilled spirits plant where they are produced. Generally, bulk distilled spir-its may be transferred in bond between bond-ed premises; however, tax liability follows these products. Additionally, in order to transfer such spirits in bond without pay-ment of tax, such spirits may not be trans-ferred in containers smaller than one gal-lon.
1178Imported bulk distilled spirits may be released from customs custody without payment of tax and transferred in bond to a distillery. Distilled spirits be exported with-out payment of tax and may be withdrawn without payment of tax or free of tax from the production facility for certain authorized uses, including industrial uses and non-bev-erage uses. A portion of the revenues from the dis-tilled spirits excise tax imposed on rum im-ported or brought into

ANCSA permits a Native Corporation to transfer money or other property to an Alas-ka Native Settlement Trust (‘‘Settlement Trust’’) for the benefit of beneficiaries who constitute all or a class of the shareholders of the Native Corporation, to promote the health, education and welfare of bene-ficiaries and to preserve the heritage and culture of Alaska Natives.
1184 Native Corporations and Settlement Trusts, as well as their shareholders and beneficiaries, are generally subject to tax under the same rules and in the same man-ner as other taxpayers that are corporations, trusts, shareholders, or beneficiaries. Special tax rules enacted in 2001 allow an election to use a more favorable tax regime for transfers of property by a Native Cor-poration to a Settlement Trust and for in-come taxation of the Settlement Trust. There is also simplified reporting to bene-ficiaries. Under the special tax rules, a Settlement Trust may make an irrevocable election to pay tax on taxable income at the lowest rate specified for individuals, (rather than the highest rate that is generally applicable to trusts) and to pay tax on capital gains at a rate consistent with being subject to such lowest rate of tax. As described further below, beneficiaries may generally there-after exclude from gross income distribu-tions from a trust that has made this elec-tion. Also, contributions from a Native Cor-poration to an electing Settlement Trust generally will not result in the recognition of gross income by beneficiaries on account of the contribution. An electing Settlement Trust remains subject to generally applica-ble requirements for classification and tax-ation as a trust. A Settlement Trust distribution is exclud-able from the gross income of beneficiaries to the extent of the taxable income of the Settlement Trust for the taxable year and all prior taxable years for which an election was in effect, decreased by income tax paid by the Trust, plus tax-exempt interest from State and local bonds for the same period. Amounts distributed in excess of the amount excludable is taxed to the beneficiaries as if distributed by the sponsoring Native Cor-poration in the year of distribution by the Trust, which means that the beneficiaries must include in gross income as dividends the amount of the distribution, up to the current and accumulated earnings and prof-its of the Native Corporation. Amounts dis-tributed in excess of the current and accu-mulated earnings and profits are not in-cluded in gross income by the beneficiaries. A special loss disallowance rule reduces (but not below zero) any loss that would oth-erwise be recognized upon disposition of stock of a sponsoring Native Corporation by a proportion, determined on a per share basis, of all contributions to all electing Set-tlement Trusts by the sponsoring Native Corporation. This rule prevents a stock-holder from being able to take advantage of a decrease in value of a Native Corporation that is caused by a transfer of assets from the Native Corporation to a Settlement Trust. The fiduciary of an electing Settlement Trust is obligated to provide certain infor-mation relating to distributions from the trust in lieu of reporting requirements under Section 6034A. The election to pay tax at the lowest rate is not available in certain disqualifying cases where transfer restrictions have been modified to allow a transfer of either: (a) a beneficial interest that would not be per-mitted by section 7(h) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act if the interest were Settlement common stock, or (b) any stock in an Alaska Native Corporation that would not be permitted by section 7(h) if it were Settlement common stock and the Native Corporation thereafter makes a transfer to the Trust. Where an election is already in ef-fect at the time of such disqualifying trans-fers, the special rules applicable to an elect-ing trust cease to apply and rules generally applicable to trusts apply. In addition, the distributable net income of the trust is in-creased by undistributed current and accu-mulated earnings and profits of the trust, limited by the fair market value of trust as-sets at the date the trust becomes so dispos-able. The effect is to cause the trust to be taxed at regular trust rates on the amount of recomputed distributable net income not dis-tributed to beneficiaries, and to cause the beneficiaries to be taxed on the amount of any distributions received consistent with the applicable tax rate bracket. 
HOUSE BILL  No provision. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The provision comprises three separate but related sections. The first section allows a Native Corporation to assign certain pay-ments described in ANCSA to a Settlement Trust without having to recognize gross in-come from those payments, provided the as-signment is in writing and the Native Cor-poration has not received the payment prior to assignment. The Settlement Trust is re-quired to include the assigned payment in gross income when received. The second section allows a Native Cor-poration to elect annually to deduct con-tributions made to a Settlement Trust. If the contribution is in cash, the deduction is in the amount of cash contributed. If the contribution is property other than cash, the deduction is the amount of the Native Cor-poration’s basis in the contributed property (or the fair market value of such property, if less than the Native Corporation’s basis), and no gain or loss can be recognized on the contribution. The Native Corporation’s de-duction is limited to the amount of its tax-able income for that year, and any unused deduction may be carried forward 15 addi-tional years. The Native Corporation’s earn-ings and profits for the taxable year are re-duced by the amount of any deduction claimed for that year. Generally, the Settlement Trust must in-clude income equal to the deduction by the Native Corporation. For contributions of property other than cash, the Settlement Trust takes a basis in the property equal to its basis in the hands of the Native Corpora-tion immediately before the contribution (or the fair market value of such property, if less than the Native Corporation’s basis), and may elect to defer recognition of income associated with such property until the Set-tlement Trust sells or disposes of the prop-erty. In that case, any income that is de-ferred (i.e., the amount of income that would have been included upon contribution absent the election to defer) is treated as ordinary income, while any gain in excess of the amount that is deferred takes the same char-acter as if the election had not been made. If property subject to this election is disposed of within the first taxable year subsequent to the taxable year in which the property was contributed to the Settlement Trust, the election is voided with respect to the prop-erty, and the Settlement Trust is required to pay any tax applicable to the disposition of the property, including interest, as well as a penalty of 10 percent of the amount of the tax. The provision provides for a four year assessment period in which to assess the tax, interest, and penalty amounts. The provision permits the amendment of the terms of any Settlement Trust agreement to allow this election within one year of the enactment of the provision, with certain restrictions. The third section of the provision requires any Native Corporation which has made an election to deduct contributions to a Settle-ment Trust as described above to furnish a statement to the Settlement Trust con-taining: (1) the total amount of contribu-tions; (2) whether such contribution was in cash; (3) for non-cash contributions, the date that such property was acquired by the Na-tive Corporation and the adjusted basis of such property on the contribution date; (4) the date on which each contribution was made to the Settlement Trust; and (5) such information as the Secretary determines is necessary for the accurate reporting of in-come relating to such contributions. Effective date.—The provision relating to the exclusion for ANCSA payments assigned to Settlement Trusts is effective to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2016. The provision relating to the deduction of contributions is effective for taxable years for which the Native Corporation’s refund statute of limitations period has not expired, and the provision provides a one-year waiver of the refund statute of limitations period in the event that the limitation period expires before the end of the one-year period begin-ning on the date of enactment. The provision relating to the reporting re-quirement applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2016.

PRESENT LAW  Excise tax on taxable transportation by air For domestic passenger transportation, section 4261 imposes an excise tax on amounts paid for taxable transportation. In general, for domestic flights, the tax consists of two parts: a 7.5 percent ad valorem tax ap- plied to the amount paid and a flat dollar amount for each flight segment (consisting of one takeoff and one landing). ‘‘Taxable transportation’’ generally means transpor-tation by air which begins and ends in the United States. The tax is paid by the person making the payment subject to tax and the tax is collected by the person receiving the payment. For commercial freight aviation, the ad valorem tax is 6.25 percent of the amount paid for transportation. In determining whether a flight con-stitutes taxable transportation and whether

1185See, e.g., Rev. Rul. 60–311, 1960–2 C.B. 341, which held that, since the company in question retains the elements of possession, command, and control of the aircraft and performs all services in connection with the operation of the aircraft, the company is, in fact, furnishing taxable transportation to the lessee; and the tax on the transportation of persons applies to the portion of the total payment which is allo-cable to the transportation of persons, provided such allocation is made on a fair and reasonable basis. If no allocation is made, the tax applies to the total payment for the lease of the aircraft.

1188The district court held that such notice is re-quired to persons having a deputy tax collection ob-ligation under the rationale of the Supreme Court’s holding in Central Illinois Public Service Company v. United States, 435 U.S. 21 (1978). 1189See also, Kerry Lynch, IRS To Shelve Pending Audits on Aircraft Management Fees, AINonline (July 17, 2017) http://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/ business-aviation/2017-07-17/irs-shelve-pending-au-dits-aircraft-management-fees. 
1190Examples of arrangements that cannot qualify a person as an ‘‘aircraft owner’’ include ownership of stock in a commercial airline and participation in a fractional ownership aircraft program. Ownership of stock in a commercial airline cannot qualify an in-dividual as an ‘‘aircraft owner’’ of a commercial air-line’s aircraft, and amounts paid for transportation on such flights remain subject to the tax under sec-tion 4261. Similarly, participation in a fractional ownership aircraft program does not constitute ‘‘air-craft ownership’’ for purposes of this standard. Amounts paid to a fractional ownership aircraft pro-gram for transportation under such a program are exempt from the ticket tax under section 4261(j) if the aircraft is operating under subpart K of part 91 of title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (‘‘sub-part K’’), and flights under such program are subject to both the fuel tax levied on non-commercial avia-tion an additional fuel surtax under section 4043 of the Code. A business arrangement seeking to cir-cumvent that surtax by operating outside of subpart K, allowing an aircraft owner the right to use any of a fleet of aircraft, be it through an aircraft inter-change agreement, through holding nominal shares in a fleet of aircraft, or any other arrangement that does not reflect true tax ownership of the aircraft being flown upon, is not considered ownership for purposes of the provision. 1191Such designated areas were referred to as em-powerment zones, the District of Columbia Enter-prise (‘‘DC’’) Zone, and the Gulf Opportunity (‘‘GO’’) Zone, and each of these designations and attendant tax incentives have expired. The designations and tax incentives for the DC Zone, and the GO Zone generally expired after December 31, 2011. 1400(f), 1400N(h), 1400N(c)(5), 1400N(a)(2)(D), 1400N(a)(7)(C), 1400N(d). The empowerment zones program and at-tendant tax incentives expired as of December 31, 2016. Secs. 1391(d)(1), There are also areas that were designated as renewal communities under section 1400E which received tax benefits that all expired as of December 31, 2009, except that a zero-percent cap-ital gains rate applies with respect to gain from the sale through December 31, 2014 of a qualified com-munity asset acquired after December 31, 2001, and before January 1, 2010 and held for more than five years. For more information on these programs and attendant tax incentives, see Joint Committee on Taxation, Incentives for Distressed Communities: Em-powerment Zones and Renewal Communities (JCX–38– 09), October 5, 2009. 
1192Sec. 45D. the amounts paid for such transportation are subject to tax, the Internal Revenue Service (‘‘IRS’’) has looked at who has ‘‘possession, command, and control’’ of the aircraft based on the relevant facts and circumstances.
1185 Applicability to aircraft management services Generally, an aircraft management serv-ices company (‘‘management company’’) has as its business purpose the management of aircraft owned by other corporations or indi-viduals (‘‘aircraft owners’’). In this function, management companies provide aircraft owners, among other things, with adminis-trative and support services (such as sched-uling, flight planning, and weather fore-casting), aircraft maintenance services, the provision of pilots and crew, and compliance with regulatory standards. Although the ar-rangement between management companies and aircraft owners may vary, it is our un-derstanding that aircraft owners generally pay management companies a monthly fee to cover the fixed expenses of maintaining the aircraft (such as insurance, maintenance, and recordkeeping) and a variable fee to cover the cost of using the aircraft (such as the provision of pilots, crew, and fuel). In March 2012, the IRS issued a Chief Coun-sel Advice determining that a management company provided all of the essential ele-ments necessary for providing transpor-tation by air and the owner relinquished pos-session, command and control to the man-agement company.
1186Thus, the management company was determined to be providing taxable transportation to the owner and was required to collect the appropriate federal excise tax from the aircraft owner and remit it to the IRS. The Chief Counsel Advice re-sulted in increased audit activity by the IRS on aircraft management companies. In May 2013, the IRS suspended assessment of the federal excise tax with respect to air-craft management services while it devel-oped guidance on the tax treatment of air-craft management issues. In a 2015 opin-ion,
1187an Ohio district court held that the existing revenue rulings (in effect for the tax period April 1, 2005, through June 30, 2009, the period that was the subject of the litiga-tion) regarding the possession, command and control test, failed to provide precise and not speculative notice of a collection obligation as it related to whole-aircraft management contracts.
1188As a result, the court ruled as a matter of law that because precise and not speculative notice was not received, the air-craft management company plaintiff did not have a collection obligation with respect to the Federal excise tax on payments received for whole-aircraft management services. In 2017, the IRS decided not to pursue ex-amination of the issue of whether amounts paid to aircraft companies by the owners or lessors of the aircraft are taxable until fur-ther guidance is made available. According to the IRS, for any exam in suspense the air-craft management fee issue was conceded and the taxpayers were notified accord-ingly.1189The IRS has not issued further guidance on this issue. 
HOUSE BILL  No provision. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The Senate amendment exempts certain payments related to the management of pri-vate aircraft from the excise taxes imposed on taxable transportation by air. Exempt payments are those amounts paid by an air-craft owner for management services related to maintenance and support of the owner’s aircraft or flights on the owner’s aircraft. Applicable services include support activi-ties related to the aircraft itself, such as its storage, maintenance, and fueling, and those related to its operation, such as the hiring and training of pilots and crew, as well as ad-ministrative services such as scheduling, flight planning, weather forecasting, obtain-ing insurance, and establishing and com-plying with safety standards. Aircraft man-agement services also include such other services as are necessary to support flights operated by an aircraft owner. Payments for flight services are exempt only to the extent that they are attributable to flights on an aircraft owner’s own air-craft.
1190Thus, if an aircraft owner makes a payment to a management company for the provision of a pilot and the pilot provides his services on the aircraft owner’s aircraft, such payment is not subject to Federal ex-cise tax. However, if the pilot provides his services to the aircraft owner on an aircraft other than the aircraft owner’s (for instance, on an aircraft that is part of a fleet of air-craft available for third-party charter serv-ices), then such payment is subject to Fed-eral excise tax. The provision provides a pro rata alloca-tion rule in the event that a monthly pay-ment made to a management company is al-located in part to exempt services and flights on the aircraft owner’s aircraft, and in part to flights on aircraft other than the aircraft owner’s. In such a circumstance, Federal ex-cise tax must be collected on that portion of the payment attributable to flights on air-craft not owned by the aircraft owner. Under the provision, a lessee of an aircraft is considered an aircraft owner provided that the lease is not a ‘‘disqualified lease.’’ A dis-qualified lease is any lease of an aircraft from a management company (or a related party) for a term of 31 days or less. Effective date.—The provision is effective for amounts paid after the date of enact-ment. CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the Sen-ate amendment. Effective date.—The provision is effective for amounts paid after the date of enact-ment. 17. Opportunity zones (sec. 13823 of the Sen-ate amendment and new secs. 1400Z–1 and 1400Z–2 of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  The Code occasionally has provided several incentives aimed at encouraging economic growth and investment in distressed commu-nities by providing Federal tax benefits to businesses located within designated bound-aries.
1191 One of these incentives is a federal income tax credit that is allowed in the aggregate amount of 39 percent of a taxpayer invest-ment in a qualified community development entity (CDE).
1192In general, the credit is al-lowed to a taxpayer who makes a ‘‘qualified equity investment’’ in a CDE which further invests in a ‘‘qualified active low-income community business.’’ CDEs are required to make investments in low income commu-nities (generally communities with 20 per-cent or greater poverty rate or median fam-ily income less than 80 percent of statewide median). The credit is allowed over seven years, five percent in each of the first three years and six percent in each of the next four years. The credit is recaptured if at any time during the seven-year period that begins on the date of the original issue of the invest-ment the entity (1) ceases to be a qualified CDE, (2) the proceeds of the investment cease to be used as required, or (3) the equity investment is redeemed. The Department of Treasury’s Community Development Finan-cial Institutions Fund (‘‘CDFI’’) allocates the new markets tax credits. The maximum annual amount of qualified equity investments is $3.5 billion for cal-endar years 2010 through 2019. The new mar-kets tax credit is set to expire on December 31, 2019. No amount of unused allocation lim-itation may be carried to any calendar year after 2024. 
HOUSE BILL  No provision. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The provision provides for the temporary deferral of inclusion in gross income for cap-ital gains reinvested in a qualified oppor-tunity fund and the permanent exclusion of capital gains from the sale or exchange of an investment in the qualified opportunity fund.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH10090 December 15, 2017 
1193Sec. 42. census tracts as qualified opportunity zones, where low-income communities are defined in Section 45D(e). The designation of a popu-lation census tract as a qualified oppor-tunity zone remains in effect for the period beginning on the date of the designation and ending at the close of the tenth calendar year beginning on or after the date of des-ignation. Governors may submit nominations for a limited number of opportunity zones to the Secretary for certification and designation. If the number of low-income communities in a State is less than 100, the Governor may designate up to 25 tracts, otherwise the Gov-ernor may designate tracts not exceeding 25 percent of the number of low-income com-munities in the State. Governors are re-quired to provide particular consideration to areas that: (1) are currently the focus of mu-tually reinforcing state, local, or private economic development initiatives to attract investment and foster startup activity; (2) have demonstrated success in geographically targeted development programs such as promise zones, the new markets tax credit, empowerment zones, and renewal commu-nities; and (3) have recently experienced sig-nificant layoffs due to business closures or relocations. The provision provides two main tax incen-tives to encourage investment in qualified opportunity zones. First, it allows for the temporary deferral of inclusion in gross in-come for capital gains that are reinvested in a qualified opportunity fund. A qualified op-portunity fund is an investment vehicle or-ganized as a corporation or a partnership for the purpose of investing in qualified oppor-tunity zone property (other than another qualified opportunity fund) that holds at least 90 percent of its assets in qualified op-portunity zone property. The provision in-tends that the certification process for a qualified opportunity fund will be done in a manner similar to the process for allocating the new markets tax credit. The provision provides the Secretary authority to carry out the process. If a qualified opportunity fund fails to meet the 90 percent requirement and unless the fund establishes reasonable cause, the fund is required to pay a monthly penalty of the excess of the amount equal to 90 percent of its aggregate assets, over the aggregate amount of qualified opportunity zone prop-erty held by the fund multiplied by the un-derpayment rate in the Code. If the fund is a partnership, the penalty is taken into ac-count proportionately as part of each part-ner’s distributive share. Qualified opportunity zone property in-cludes: any qualified opportunity zone stock, any qualified opportunity zone partnership interest, and any qualified opportunity zone business property. The maximum amount of the deferred gain is equal to the amount invested in a quali-fied opportunity fund by the taxpayer during the 180-day period beginning on the date of sale of the asset to which the deferral per-tains. For amounts of the capital gains that exceed the maximum deferral amount, the capital gains must be recognized and in-cluded in gross income as under present law. If the investment in the qualified oppor-tunity zone fund is held by the taxpayer for at least five years, the basis on the original gain is increased by 10 percent of the original gain. If the opportunity zone asset or invest-ment is held by the taxpayer for at least seven years, the basis on the original gain is increased by an additional 5 percent of the original gain. The deferred gain is recognized on the earlier of the date on which the quali-fied opportunity zone investment is disposed of or December 31, 2026. Only taxpayers who rollover capital gains of non-zone assets be-fore December 31, 2026, will be able to take advantage of the special treatment of capital gains for non-zone and zone realizations under the provision. The basis of an investment in a qualified opportunity zone fund immediately after its acquisition is zero. If the investment is held by the taxpayer for at least five years, the basis on the investment is increased by 10 percent of the deferred gain. If the invest-ment is held by the taxpayer for at least seven years, the basis on the investment is increased by an additional five percent of the deferred gain. If the investment is held by the taxpayer until at least December 31, 2026, the basis in the investment increases by the remaining 85 percent of the deferred gain. The second main tax incentive in the bill excludes from gross income the post-acquisi-tion capital gains on investments in oppor-tunity zone funds that are held for at least 10 years. Specifically, in the case of the sale or exchange of an investment in a qualified op-portunity zone fund held for more than 10 years, at the election of the taxpayer the basis of such investment in the hands of the taxpayer shall be the fair market value of the investment at the date of such sale or ex-change. Taxpayers can continue to recognize losses associated with investments in quali-fied opportunity zone funds as under current law. The Secretary or the Secretary’s delegate is required to report annually to Congress on the opportunity zone incentives beginning 5 years after the date of enactment. The re-port is to include an assessment of invest-ments held by the qualified opportunity fund nationally and at the State level. To the ex-tent the information is available, the report is to include the number of qualified oppor-tunity funds, the amount of assets held in qualified opportunity funds, the composition of qualified opportunity fund investments by asset class, and the percentage of qualified opportunity zone census tracts designated under the provision that have received quali-fied opportunity fund investments. The re-port is also to include an assessment of the impacts and outcomes of the investments in those areas on economic indicators including job creation, poverty reduction and new business starts, and other metrics as deter-mined by the Secretary. Effective date.—The provision is effective on the date of enactment. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement generally fol-lows the Senate amendment with the fol-lowing modifications. First, the provision provides that each population census tract in each U.S. possession that is a low-income community is deemed certified and des-ignated as a qualified opportunity zone effec-tive on the date of enactment. Second, the provision clarifies that chief executive offi-cer of the State (which includes the District of Columbia) may submit nominations for a limited number of opportunity zones to the Secretary for certification and designation. This change clarifies that the mayor of the District of Columbia may also submit nomi-nations. Third, the provision clarifies that there is no gain deferral available with re-spect to any sale or exchange made after De-cember 31, 2026, and there is no exclusion available for investments in qualified oppor-tunity zones made after December 31, 2026. The agreement also makes some technical changes to the Senate amendment to make it clear which taxpayer may claim the tax benefits. 18. Provisions relating to the low-income housing credit (secs. 13411 and 13412 of the Senate amendment and sec. 42 of the Code) PRESENT LAW  In general The low-income housing credit may be claimed over a 10-year period for the cost of building rental housing a sufficient portion of which is rent restricted and occupied by tenants having incomes below specified lev-els.
1193Qualified basis is the low-income por-tion of the building times the eligible basis. The amount of the credit for any taxable year in the credit period is the applicable percentage of the qualified basis of each qualified low-income building. The applica-ble percentage for new buildings that are not Federally subsidized, is computed to yield a present value of 70 percent of the qualified basis over a 10-year period. For other build-ings the applicable percentage is calculated to yield 30 percent. Rehabilitation expenses are treated as a separate new building. Increase in credit for certain high cost areas In the case of a building located in a quali-fied census tract or difficult development area, the eligible basis of a building is 130 percent of eligible basis. This ‘‘basis boost also applies to rehabilitation expenditures that are treated as a separate new building. A ‘‘difficult development area’’ is an area designated by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (‘‘HUD’’) as having high construction, land, and utility costs relative to the area’s median income. The portions of metropolitan statistical areas that may be designated for this purpose cannot exceed an aggregate area having 20 percent of the popu-lation of such metropolitan statistical areas. A comparable rule applies to nonmetropoli-tan areas. A ‘‘qualified census tract’’ means any cen-sus tract which is designated by HUD in which either: (1) 50 percent or more of the households have an income which is less than 60 percent of the area median income for the year; or (2) the poverty rate in that tract is 25 percent. The portion of a metro-politan statistical area that may be des-ignated for this purpose cannot exceed an area having 20 percent of the population of such metropolitan statistical area. Each metropolitan statistical area is treated as a separate area and all nonmetropolitan areas in a State are treated as one area. In addition, a building which is designated by a State housing credit agency as requir-ing an increase in credit to be financially feasible is treated as located in a HUD-des-ignated difficult development area. This rule does not apply to a building if any portion of the eligible basis is financed with tax-ex-empt bonds. General public use In order to be eligible for the low-income housing credit, the residential units in a qualified low-income housing project must be available for use by the general public. A project is available for general public use if the project complies with housing non-dis-crimination policies including those set forth in the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. sec. 3601) and (2) the project does not restrict oc-cupancy based on membership in a social or-ganization or employment by specific em-ployers. In addition, any residential unit that is part of a hospital, nursing home, san-itarium, lifecare facility, trailer park, or in-termediate care facility for the mentally or physically handicapped is not available for use by the general public. However, a project that otherwise meets the general public use requirements above

HOUSE BILL  No provision. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  Treatment of veterans’ preference as not vio-lating general public use requirements The provision replaces the exception to the general public use requirement for tenants engaged in artistic and literary activities with an exception for veterans. Increase in credit for certain rural housing For buildings eligible for the 70 percent present-value credit, the provision makes two changes. First, the provision treats such buildings located in rural areas (as defined in section 520 of the Fair Housing Act of 1949) as located in a HUD-designated difficult devel-opment area. Second, the provision reduces the eligible basis for difficult to develop areas and qualified census tracts from 130 percent to 125 percent.
1194 Effective date.—The provisions generally apply to buildings placed in service after the date of enactment.

Clarification of unrelated business income tax treatment of entities exempt from tax under section 501(a) (sec. 5001 of the House bill and sec. 511 of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  Tax exemption for certain organizations Section 501(a) exempts certain organiza-tions from Federal income tax. Such organi-zations include: (1) tax-exempt organizations described in section 501(c) (including among others section 501(c)(3) charitable organiza-tions and section 501(c)(4) social welfare or-ganizations); (2) religious and apostolic orga-nizations described in section 501(d); and (3) trusts forming part of a pension, profit-shar-ing, or stock bonus plan of an employer de-scribed in section 401(a). Section 115 excludes from gross income certain income of entities that perform an essential government function. The exemp-tion applies to: (1) income derived from any public utility or the exercise of any essential governmental function and accruing to a State or any political subdivision thereof, or the District of Columbia; or (2) income ac-cruing to the government of any possession of the United States, or any political sub-division thereof. Unrelated business income tax, in general An exempt organization generally may have revenue from four sources: contribu-tions, gifts, and grants; trade or business in-come that is related to exempt activities (e.g., program service revenue); investment income; and trade or business income that is not related to exempt activities. The Federal income tax exemption generally extends to the first three categories, and does not ex-tend to an organization’s unrelated trade or business income. In some cases, however, the investment income of an organization is taxed as if it were unrelated trade or busi-ness income.1195 The unrelated business income tax (‘‘UBIT’’) generally applies to income de-rived from a trade or business regularly car-ried on by the organization that is not sub-stantially related to the performance of the organization’s tax-exempt functions.
1196An organization that is subject to UBIT and that has $1,000 or more of gross unrelated business taxable income must report that in-come on Form 990–T (Exempt Organization Business Income Tax Return). Most exempt organizations may operate an unrelated trade or business so long as the or-ganization remains primarily engaged in ac-tivities that further its exempt purposes. Therefore, an organization may engage in a substantial amount of unrelated business ac-tivity without jeopardizing exempt status. A section 501(c)(3) (charitable) organization, however, may not operate an unrelated trade or business as a substantial part of its activi-ties.
1197Therefore, the unrelated trade or business activity of a section 501(c)(3) orga-nization must be insubstantial. Organizations subject to tax on unrelated business income Most exempt organizations are subject to the tax on unrelated business income. Spe-cifically, organizations subject to the unre-lated business income tax generally include: (1) organizations exempt from tax under sec-tion 501(a), including organizations described in section 501(c) (except for U.S. instrumen-talities and certain charitable trusts);
1198(2) qualified pension, profit-sharing, and stock bonus plans described in section 401(a);
1199 and (3) certain State colleges and univer-sities.
1200 
HOUSE BILL  The provision clarifies that an organiza-tion does not fail to be subject to tax on its unrelated business income as an organiza-tion exempt from tax under section 501(a) solely because the organization also is ex-empt, or excludes amounts from gross in-come, by reason of another provision of the Code. For example, if an organization is de-scribed in section 401(a) (and thus is exempt from tax under section 501(a)) and its income also is described in section 115 (relating to the exclusion from gross income of certain income derived from the exercise of an essen-tial governmental function), its status under section 115 does not cause it to be exempt from tax on its unrelated business income. Effective date.—The provision is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  No provision. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement does not include the House bill provision. 2. Exclusion of research income from unre-lated business taxable income limited to publicly available research (sec. 5002 of the House bill and sec. 512(b)(9) of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  Tax exemption for certain organizations Section 501(a) exempts certain organiza-tions from Federal income tax. Such organi-zations include: (1) tax-exempt organizations described in section 501(c) (including among others section 501(c)(3) charitable organiza-tions and section 501(c)(4) social welfare or-ganizations); (2) religious and apostolic orga-nizations described in section 501(d); and (3) trusts forming part of a pension, profit-shar-ing, or stock bonus plan of an employer de-scribed in section 401(a). Unrelated business income tax, in general The unrelated business income tax (‘‘UBIT’’) generally applies to income de-rived from a trade or business regularly car-ried on by the organization that is not sub-stantially related to the performance of the organization’s tax-exempt functions.1201An organization that is subject to UBIT and that has $1,000 or more of gross unrelated business taxable income must report that in-come on Form 990–T (Exempt Organization Business Income Tax Return). Most exempt organizations may operate an unrelated trade or business so long as the or-ganization remains primarily engaged in ac-tivities that further its exempt purposes. Therefore, an organization may engage in a substantial amount of unrelated business ac-tivity without jeopardizing exempt status. A section 501(c)(3) (charitable) organization, however, may not operate an unrelated trade or business as a substantial part of its activi-ties.
1202Therefore, the unrelated trade or business activity of a section 501(c)(3) orga-nization must be insubstantial. Organizations subject to tax on unrelated business income Most exempt organizations are subject to the tax on unrelated business income. Spe-cifically, organizations subject to the unre-lated business income tax generally include: (1) organizations exempt from tax under sec-tion 501(a), including organizations described in section 501(c) (except for U.S. instrumen-talities and certain charitable trusts);
1203(2) qualified pension, profit-sharing, and stock bonus plans described in section 401(a);
1204 and (3) certain State colleges and univer-sities.
1205 Exclusions from unrelated business taxable income In general Certain types of income are specifically ex-empt from unrelated business taxable in-come, such as dividends, interest, royalties, and certain rents,
1206unless derived from debt-financed property or from certain 50- percent controlled subsidiaries.
1207Other ex- emptions from UBIT are provided for activi-ties in which substantially all the work is performed by volunteers, for income from the sale of donated goods, and for certain ac-tivities carried on for the convenience of members, students, patients, officers, or em-ployees of a charitable organization. In addi-tion, special UBIT provisions exempt from tax activities of trade shows and State fairs, income from bingo games, and income from the distribution of low-cost items incidental to the solicitation of charitable contribu-tions. Organizations liable for tax on unre-lated business taxable income may be liable for alternative minimum tax determined after taking into account adjustments and tax preference items. Research income Certain income derived from research ac-tivities of exempt organizations is excluded from unrelated business taxable income. For

HOUSE BILL  The provision modifies the exclusion of in-come from research performed by an organi-zation operated primarily for purposes of carrying on fundamental research the results of which are freely available to the general public (section 512(b)(9)).

CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement does not include the House bill provision. 3. Unrelated business taxable income sepa-rately computed for each trade or busi-ness activity (sec. 13703 of the Senate amendment and sec. 512(a) of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  Tax exemption for certain organizations Section 501(a) exempts certain organiza-tions from Federal income tax. Such organi-zations include: (1) tax-exempt organizations described in section 501(c) (including among others section 501(c)(3) charitable organiza-tions and section 501(c)(4) social welfare or-ganizations); (2) religious and apostolic orga-nizations described in section 501(d); and (3) trusts forming part of a pension, profit-shar-ing, or stock bonus plan of an employer de-scribed in section 401(a). Unrelated business income tax, in general An exempt organization generally may have revenue from four sources: contribu-tions, gifts, and grants; trade or business in-come that is related to exempt activities (e.g., program service revenue); investment income; and trade or business income that is not related to exempt activities. The Federal income tax exemption generally extends to the first three categories, and does not ex-tend to an organization’s unrelated trade or business income. In some cases, however, the investment income of an organization is taxed as if it were unrelated trade or busi-ness income.
1211 The unrelated business income tax (‘‘UBIT’’) generally applies to income de-rived from a trade or business regularly car-ried on by the organization that is not sub-stantially related to the performance of the organization’s tax-exempt functions.
1212An organization that is subject to UBIT and that has $1,000 or more of gross unrelated business taxable income must report that in-come on Form 990–T (Exempt Organization Business Income Tax Return). Most exempt organizations may operate an unrelated trade or business so long as the or-ganization remains primarily engaged in ac-tivities that further its exempt purposes. Therefore, an organization may engage in a substantial amount of unrelated business ac-tivity without jeopardizing exempt status. A section 501(c)(3) (charitable) organization, however, may not operate an unrelated trade or business as a substantial part of its activi-ties.1213Therefore, the unrelated trade or business activity of a section 501(c)(3) orga-nization must be insubstantial. Organizations subject to tax on unrelated business income Most exempt organizations are subject to the tax on unrelated business income. Spe-cifically, organizations subject to the unre-lated business income tax generally include: (1) organizations exempt from tax under sec-tion 501(a), including organizations described in section 501(c) (except for U.S. instrumen-talities and certain charitable trusts);
1214(2) qualified pension, profit-sharing, and stock bonus plans described in section 401(a);
1215 and (3) certain State colleges and univer-sities.
1216 Exclusions from Unrelated Business Taxable Income Certain types of income are specifically ex-empt from unrelated business taxable in-come, such as dividends, interest, royalties, and certain rents,
1217unless derived from debt-financed property or from certain 50- percent controlled subsidiaries.
1218Other ex- emptions from UBIT are provided for activi-ties in which substantially all the work is performed by volunteers, for income from the sale of donated goods, and for certain ac-tivities carried on for the convenience of members, students, patients, officers, or em-ployees of a charitable organization. In addi-tion, special UBIT provisions exempt from tax activities of trade shows and State fairs, income from bingo games, and income from the distribution of low-cost items incidental to the solicitation of charitable contribu-tions. Organizations liable for tax on unre-lated business taxable income may be liable for alternative minimum tax determined after taking into account adjustments and tax preference items. Specific deduction against unrelated business taxable income In computing unrelated business taxable income, an exempt organization may take a specific deduction of $1,000. This specific de-duction may not be used to create a net op-erating loss that will be carried back or for-ward to another year.
1219 In the case of a diocese, province or reli-gious order, or a convention or association of churches, a specific deduction is allowed with respect to each parish, individual church, district, or other local unit. The spe-cific deduction is equal to the lower of $1,000 or the gross income derived from any unre-lated trade or business regularly carried on by the local unit.
1220 Operation of multiple unrelated trades or businesses An organization determines its unrelated business taxable income by subtracting from its gross unrelated business income deduc-tions directly connected with the unrelated trade or business.
1221Under regulations, in determining unrelated business taxable in-come, an organization that operates multiple unrelated trades or businesses aggregates in-come from all such activities and subtracts from the aggregate gross income the aggre-gate of deductions.1222As a result, an organi-zation may use a deduction from one unre-lated trade or business to offset income from another, thereby reducing total unrelated business taxable income. 
HOUSE BILL  No provision. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  For an organization with more than one unrelated trade or business, the provision re-quires that unrelated business taxable in-come first be computed separately with re-spect to each trade or business and without regard to the specific deduction generally al-lowed under section 512(b)(12). The organiza-tion’s unrelated business taxable income for a taxable year is the sum of the amounts (not less than zero) computed for each sepa-rate unrelated trade or business, less the spe-cific deduction allowed under section 512(b)(12). A net operating loss deduction is allowed only with respect to a trade or busi-ness from which the loss arose. The result of the provision is that a deduc-tion from one trade or business for a taxable year may not be used to offset income from a different unrelated trade or business for the same taxable year. The provision gen-erally does not, however, prevent an organi-zation from using a deduction from one tax-able year to offset income from the same un-related trade or business activity in another taxable year, where appropriate. Effective date.—The provision is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. Under a special transition rule, net operating losses arising in a taxable year be-ginning before January 1, 2018, that are car-ried forward to a taxable year beginning on or after such date are not subject to the rule of the provision. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the Sen-ate amendment. B. Excise Taxes 1. Simplification of excise tax on private foundation investment income (sec. 5101 of the House bill and sec. 4940 of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  Excise tax on the net investment income of private foundations Under section 4940(a), private foundations that are recognized as exempt from Federal income tax under section 501(a) (other than exempt operating foundations
1223) are sub- ject to a two-percent excise tax on their net investment income. Net investment income generally includes interest, dividends, rents, royalties (and income from similar sources), and capital gain net income, and is reduced by expenses incurred to earn this income. The two-percent rate of tax is reduced to one-percent in any year in which a founda-tion exceeds the average historical level of its charitable distributions. Specifically, the excise tax rate is reduced if the foundation’s qualifying distributions (generally, amounts

Failing this me-chanical test, the organization may qualify as a pub-lic charity if it passes a ‘‘facts and circumstances’’ test. Treas. Reg. sec. 1.170A–9(f)(3). 
1230To meet this requirement, the organization must normally receive more than one-third of its support from a combination of (1) gifts, grants, con-tributions, or membership fees and (2) certain gross receipts from admissions, sales of merchandise, per-formance of services, and furnishing of facilities in connection with activities that are related to the or-ganization’s exempt purposes. Sec. 509(a)(2)(A). In addition, the organization must not normally re-ceive more than one-third of its public support in each taxable year from the sum of (1) gross invest-ment income and (2) the excess of unrelated business taxable income as determined under section 512 over the amount of unrelated business income tax im-posed by section 511. Sec. 509(a)(2)(B). 
1231Sec. 509(a)(3). Supporting organizations are fur-ther classified as Type I, II, or III depending on the relationship they have with the organizations they support. Supporting organizations must support public charities listed in one of the other categories (i.e., per se public charities, broadly supported public charities, or revenue generating public charities), and they are not permitted to support other sup-porting organizations or testing for public safety or-ganizations. Organizations organized and operated exclusively for testing for public safety also are classified as public charities. Sec. 509(a)(4). Such organizations, however, are not eligible to receive deductible chari-table contributions under section 170. 
1232Unlike public charities, private foundations are subject to tax on their net investment income at a rate of two percent (one percent in some cases). Sec. 4940. Private foundations also are subject to more restrictions on their activities than are public char-ities. For example, private foundations are prohib-ited from engaging in self-dealing transactions (sec. 4941), are required to make a minimum amount of charitable distributions each year, (sec. 4942), are limited in the extent to which they may control a business (sec. 4943), may not make speculative in-vestments (sec. 4944), and may not make certain ex-penditures (sec. 4945). Violations of these rules re-sult in excise taxes on the foundation and, in some cases, may result in excise taxes on the managers of the foundation.

1225In addi- tion, the foundation cannot have been sub-ject to tax in any of the five preceding years for failure to meet minimum qualifying dis-tribution requirements in section 4942. Private foundations that are not exempt from tax under section 501(a), such as certain charitable trusts, are subject to an excise tax under section 4940(b). The tax is equal to the excess of the sum of the excise tax that would have been imposed under section 4940(a) if the foundation were tax exempt and the amount of the tax on unrelated business income that would have been imposed if the foundation were tax exempt, over the income tax imposed on the foundation under subtitle A of the Code. Private foundations are required to make a minimum amount of qualifying distributions each year to avoid tax under section 4942. The minimum amount of qualifying distribu-tions a foundation has to make to avoid tax under section 4942 is reduced by the amount of section 4940 excise taxes paid.
1226 
HOUSE BILL  The provision replaces the two rates of ex-cise tax on tax-exempt private foundations with a single rate of tax of 1.4 percent. Thus, under the provision, a tax-exempt private foundation generally is subject to an excise tax of 1.4 percent on its net investment in-come. A taxable private foundation is sub-ject to an excise tax equal to the excess (if any) of the sum of the 1.4-percent net invest-ment income excise tax and the amount of the tax on unrelated business income (both calculated as if the foundation were tax-ex-empt), over the income tax imposed on the foundation. The provision repeals the special reduced excise tax rate for private founda-tions that exceed their historical level of qualifying distributions. Effective date.—The provision is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  No provision. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement does not include the House bill provision. 2. Private operating foundation requirements relating to operation of an art museum (sec. 5102 of the House bill and sec. 4942(j) of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  Public charities and private foundations An organization qualifying for tax-exempt status under section 501(c)(3) is further clas-sified as either a public charity or a private foundation. An organization may qualify as a public charity in several ways.
1227Certain organizations are classified as public char-ities per se, regardless of their sources of support. These include churches, certain schools, hospitals and other medical organi-zations, certain organizations providing as-sistance to colleges and universities, and governmental units.
1228Other organizations qualify as public charities because they are broadly publicly supported. First, a charity may qualify as publicly supported if at least one-third of its total support is from gifts, grants, or other contributions from govern-mental units or the general public.1229Alter- natively, it may qualify as publicly sup-ported if it receives more than one-third of its total support from a combination of gifts, grants, and contributions from governmental units and the public plus revenue arising from activities related to its exempt pur-poses (e.g., fee for service income). In addi-tion, this category of public charity must not rely excessively on endowment income as a source of support.
1230A supporting orga-nization, i.e., an organization that provides support to another section 501(c)(3) entity that is not a private foundation and meets certain other requirements of the Code, also is classified as a public charity.
1231 A section 501(c)(3) organization that does not fit within any of the above categories is a private foundation. In general, private foundations receive funding from a limited number of sources (e.g., an individual, a fam-ily, or a corporation). The deduction for charitable contributions to private foundations is in some instances less generous than the deduction for chari-table contributions to public charities. In ad-dition, private foundations are subject to a number of operational rules and restrictions that do not apply to public charities.
1232 Tax on failure to distribute income by private nonoperating foundations Private nonoperating foundations are re-quired to pay out a minimum amount each year as qualifying distributions.
1233In gen- eral, a qualifying distribution is an amount paid to accomplish one or more of the orga-nization’s exempt purposes, including rea-sonable and necessary administrative ex-penses.1234Failure to pay out the minimum required amount results in an initial excise tax on the foundation of 30 percent of the un-distributed amount. An additional tax of 100 percent of the undistributed amount applies if an initial tax is imposed and the required distributions have not been made by the end of the applicable taxable period.
1235A foun- dation may include as a qualifying distribu-tion the salaries, occupancy expenses, travel costs, and other reasonable and necessary administrative expenses that the foundation incurs in operating a grant program. A quali-fying distribution also includes any amount paid to acquire an asset used (or held for use) directly in carrying out one or more of the organization’s exempt purposes and certain amounts set aside for exempt purposes.
1236 Private operating foundations The tax on failure to distribute income does not apply to the undistributed income of a private foundation for any taxable year for which it is an operating foundation.
1237 Private operating foundations generally op-erate their own charitable programs di-rectly, rather than serving primarily as a grantmaking entity. Private operating foundations must satisfy several tests designed to distinguish them from nonoperating (grantmaking) founda-tions. First, an operating foundation gen-erally must make qualifying distributions for the direct conduct of activities that are related to its exempt purpose (as opposed to making such distributions in the form of grants to other charities) equal to 85 percent of the lesser of its adjusted net income or its minimum investment return, each as defined under section 4942.
1238In addition, an oper-ating foundation must satisfy one of the fol-lowing three alternative tests: (1) an asset test, under which substantially more than half of the organization’s assets (generally, 65 percent) are devoted to the direct conduct of exempt activities or to functionally re-lated businesses; (2) an endowment test, under which the organization normally makes qualifying distributions for the direct conduct of activities related to its exempt purpose in an amount not less than two- thirds of its minimum investment return; or (3) a support test, under which the organiza-tion must meet certain measures to show that it receives public support.
1239 
HOUSE BILL  Under the provision, an organization that operates an art museum as a substantial ac-tivity does not qualify as a private operating foundation unless the museum is open during normal business hours to the public for at least 1,000 hours during the taxable year. Effective date.—The provision is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017.

For example, private foundations are prohib-ited from engaging in self-dealing transactions (sec. 4941), are required to make a minimum amount of charitable distributions each year, (sec. 4942), are limited in the extent to which they may control a business (sec. 4943), may not make speculative in-vestments (sec. 4944), and may not make certain ex-penditures (sec. 4945). Violations of these rules re-sult in excise taxes on the foundation and, in some cases, may result in excise taxes on the managers of the foundation. 
1246Exempt operating foundations are exempt from the section 4940 tax. Sec. 4940(d)(1). Exempt oper-ating foundations generally include organizations such as museums or libraries that devote their as-sets to operating charitable programs but have dif-ficulty meeting the ‘‘public support’’ tests necessary not to be classified as a private foundation. To be an exempt operating foundation, an organization must: (1) be an operating foundation (as defined in section 4942(j)(3)); (2) be publicly supported for at least 10 taxable years; (3) have a governing body no more than 25 percent of whom are disqualified persons and that is broadly representative of the general public; and (4) have no officers who are disqualified persons.

PRESENT LAW  Public charities and private foundations An organization qualifying for tax-exempt status under section 501(c)(3) is further clas-sified as either a public charity or a private foundation. An organization may qualify as a public charity in several ways.
1240Certain organizations are classified as public char-ities per se, regardless of their sources of support. These include churches, certain schools, hospitals and other medical organi-zations, certain organizations providing as-sistance to colleges and universities, and governmental units.
1241Other organizations qualify as public charities because they are broadly publicly supported. First, a charity may qualify as publicly supported if at least one-third of its total support is from gifts, grants or other contributions from govern-mental units or the general public.
1242Alter- natively, it may qualify as publicly sup-ported if it receives more than one-third of its total support from a combination of gifts, grants, and contributions from governmental units and the public plus revenue arising from activities related to its exempt pur-poses (e.g., fee for service income). In addi-tion, this category of public charity must not rely excessively on endowment income as a source of support.
1243A supporting orga-nization, i.e., an organization that provides support to another section 501(c)(3) entity that is not a private foundation and meets the requirements of the Code, also is classi-fied as a public charity.
1244 A section 501(c)(3) organization that does not fit within any of the above categories is a private foundation. In general, private foundations receive funding from a limited number of sources (e.g., an individual, a fam-ily, or a corporation). The deduction for charitable contributions to private foundations is in some instances less generous than the deduction for chari-table contributions to public charities. In ad-dition, private foundations are subject to a number of operational rules and restrictions that do not apply to public charities.1245 Excise tax on investment income of private foundations Under section 4940(a), private foundations that are recognized as exempt from Federal income tax under section 501(a) (other than exempt operating foundations)
1246are sub- ject to a two-percent excise tax on their net investment income. Net investment income generally includes interest, dividends, rents, royalties (and income from similar sources), and capital gain net income, and is reduced by expenses incurred to earn this income. The two-percent rate of tax is reduced to one-percent in any year in which a founda-tion exceeds the average historical level of its charitable distributions. Specifically, the excise tax rate is reduced if the foundation’s qualifying distributions (generally, amounts paid to accomplish exempt purposes)
1247 equal or exceed the sum of (1) the amount of the foundation’s assets for the taxable year multiplied by the average percentage of the foundation’s qualifying distributions over the five taxable years immediately preceding the taxable year in question, and (2) one per-cent of the net investment income of the foundation for the taxable year.
1248In addi- tion, the foundation cannot have been sub-ject to tax in any of the five preceding years for failure to meet minimum qualifying dis-tribution requirements in section 4942. Private foundations that are not exempt from tax under section 501(a), such as certain charitable trusts, are subject to an excise tax under section 4940(b). The tax is equal to the excess of the sum of the excise tax that would have been imposed under section 4940(a) if the foundation were tax exempt and the amount of the tax on unrelated business income that would have been imposed if the foundation were tax exempt, over the income tax imposed on the foundation under subtitle A of the Code. Private foundations are required to make a minimum amount of qualifying distributions each year to avoid tax under section 4942. The minimum amount of qualifying distribu-tions a foundation has to make to avoid tax under section 4942 is reduced by the amount of section 4940 excise taxes paid.
1249 Private colleges and universities Private colleges and universities generally are treated as public charities rather than private foundations1250and thus are not sub-ject to the private foundation excise tax on net investment income. 
HOUSE BILL  The provision imposes an excise tax on an applicable educational institution for each taxable year equal to 1.4 percent of the net investment income of the institution for the taxable year. Net investment income is de-termined using rules similar to the rules of section 4940(c) (relating to the net invest-ment income of a private foundation). For purposes of the provision, an applica-ble educational institution is an institution: (1) that has at least 500 students during the preceding taxable year; (2) that is an eligible education institution as described in section 25A of the Code;
1251(3) that is not described in the first section of section 511(a)(2)(B) of the Code (generally describing State colleges and universities); and (4) the aggregate fair market value of the assets of which at the end of the preceding taxable year (other than those assets that are used directly in car-rying out the institution’s exempt pur-pose
1252) is at least $250,000 per student. For these purposes, the number of students of an institution is based on the daily average number of full-time students attending the institution, with part-time students being taken into account on a full-time student equivalent basis. For purposes of determining whether an in-stitution meets the asset-per-student thresh-old and determining net investment income, assets and net investment income include amounts with respect to an organization that is related to the institution. An organi-zation is treated as related to the institution for this purpose if the organization: (1) con-trols, or is controlled by, the institution; (2) is controlled by one or more persons that control the institution; or (3) is a supported organization
1253or a supporting organiza-tion
1254during the taxable year with respect to the institution. Effective date.—The provision is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The Senate amendment follows the House bill with the following modifications. First, the definition of applicable educational in-stitution is modified in two ways: (1) it re-quires that the educational institution have at least 500 tuition paying students; and (2) it increases the asset-per-student threshold from $250,000 to $500,000. Second, the Senate amendment clarifies the operation of the related-party rules of the provision. For purposes of determining whether an educational institution meets the asset-per-student threshold and for pur-poses of determining net investment income, assets and net investment income of a re-lated organization with respect to the edu-cational institution are treated as assets and net investment income, respectively, of the educational institution, except that: 1. No such amount is taken into account with respect to more than one educational institution; and

1257Treas. Reg. sec. 1.170A–9(f)(2). Failing this me-chanical test, the organization may qualify as a pub-lic charity if it passes a ‘‘facts and circumstances’’ test. Treas. Reg. sec. 1.170A–9(f)(3). 1258To meet this requirement, the organization must normally receive more than one-third of its support from a combination of (1) gifts, grants, con-tributions, or membership fees and (2) certain gross receipts from admissions, sales of merchandise, per-formance of services, and furnishing of facilities in connection with activities that are related to the or-ganization’s exempt purposes. Sec. 509(a)(2)(A). In addition, the organization must not normally re-ceive more than one-third of its public support in each taxable year from the sum of (1) gross invest-ment income and (2) the excess of unrelated business taxable income as determined under section 512 over the amount of unrelated business income tax im-posed by section 511. Sec. 509(a)(2)(B). 
1259Sec. 509(a)(3). Organizations organized and op-erated exclusively for testing for public safety also are classified as public charities. Sec. 509(a)(4). Such organizations, however, are not eligible to receive deductible charitable contributions under section 170. 
1260Unlike public charities, private foundations are subject to tax on their net investment income at a rate of two percent (one percent in some cases). Sec. 4940. Private foundations also are subject to more restrictions on their activities than are public char-ities. For example, private foundations are prohib-ited from engaging in self-dealing transactions (sec. 4941), are required to make a minimum amount of charitable distributions each year (sec. 4942), are limited in the extent to which they may control a business (sec. 4943), may not make speculative in-vestments (sec. 4944), and may not make certain ex-penditures (sec. 4945). Violations of these rules re-sult in excise taxes on the foundation and, in some cases, may result in excise taxes on the managers of the foundation.

1264Sec. 4943(d)(3). 2. Unless the related organization is con-trolled by the educational institution or is a supporting organization (described in section 509(a)(3)) with respect to the institution for the taxable year, assets and investment in-come that are not intended or available for the use or benefit of the educational institu-tion are not taken into account. For exam-ple, assets of a related organization that are earmarked or restricted for (or fairly attrib-utable to) the educational institution would be treated as assets of the educational insti-tution, whereas assets of a related organiza-tion that are held for unrelated purposes (and are not fairly attributable to the edu-cational institution) would be disregarded. Effective date.—The provision is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the Sen-ate amendment with the following modifica-tion. The provision modifies the definition of ‘‘applicable educational institution’’ to in-clude only institutions more than 50 percent of the tuition paying students of which are located in the United States. For this pur-pose, the number of students at a location is based on the daily average number of full- time students attending the institution, with part-time students being taken into ac-count on a full-time student equivalent basis. It is intended that the Secretary promul-gate regulations to carry out the intent of the provision, including regulations that de-scribe: (1) assets that are used directly in carrying out the educational institution’s exempt purpose; (2) the computation of net investment income; and (3) assets that are intended or available for the use or benefit of the educational institution. Effective date.—The provision is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 4. Provide an exception to the private foun-dation excess business holdings rules for philanthropic business holdings (sec. 5104 of the House bill and sec. 4943 of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  Public charities and private foundations An organization qualifying for tax-exempt status under section 501(c)(3) is further clas-sified as either a public charity or a private foundation. An organization may qualify as a public charity in several ways.
1255Certain organizations are classified as public char-ities per se, regardless of their sources of support. These include churches, certain schools, hospitals and other medical organi-zations (including medical research organi-zations), certain organizations providing as-sistance to colleges and universities, and governmental units.
1256Other organizations qualify as public charities because they are broadly publicly supported. First, a charity may qualify as publicly supported if at least one-third of its total support is from gifts, grants, or other contributions from govern-mental units or the general public.
1257Alter- natively, it may qualify as publicly sup-ported if it receives more than one-third of its total support from a combination of gifts, grants, and contributions from governmental units and the public plus revenue arising from activities related to its exempt pur-poses (e.g., fee for service income). In addi-tion, this category of public charity must not rely excessively on endowment income as a source of support.1258A supporting orga-nization, i.e., an organization that provides support to another section 501(c)(3) entity that is not a private foundation and meets certain other requirements of the Code, also is classified as a public charity.
1259 A section 501(c)(3) organization that does not fit within any of the above categories is a private foundation. In general, private foundations receive funding from a limited number of sources (e.g., an individual, a fam-ily, or a corporation). The deduction for charitable contributions to private foundations is in some instances less generous than the deduction for chari-table contributions to public charities. In ad-dition, private foundations are subject to a number of operational rules and restrictions that do not apply to public charities, as well as a tax on their net investment income.
1260 Excess business holdings of private founda-tions Private foundations are subject to tax on excess business holdings.
1261In general, a pri-vate foundation is permitted to hold 20 per-cent of the voting stock in a corporation, re-duced by the amount of voting stock held by all disqualified persons (as defined in section 4946). If it is established that no disqualified person has effective control of the corpora-tion, a private foundation and disqualified persons together may own up to 35 percent of the voting stock of a corporation. A private foundation shall not be treated as having ex-cess business holdings in any corporation if it owns (together with certain other related private foundations) not more than two per-cent of the voting stock and not more than two percent in value of all outstanding shares of all classes of stock in that corpora-tion. Similar rules apply with respect to holdings in a partnership (substituting ‘‘profits interest’’ for ‘‘voting stock’’ and ‘‘capital interest’’ for ‘‘nonvoting stock’’) and to other unincorporated enterprises (by substituting ‘‘beneficial interest’’ for ‘‘vot-ing stock’’). Private foundations are not per-mitted to have holdings in a proprietorship. Foundations generally have a five-year pe-riod to dispose of excess business holdings (acquired other than by purchase) without being subject to tax.1262This five-year period may be extended an additional five years in limited circumstances.
1263The excess busi-ness holdings rules do not apply to holdings in a functionally related business or to hold-ings in a trade or business at least 95 percent of the gross income of which is derived from passive sources.
1264 The initial tax is equal to five percent of the value of the excess business holdings held during the foundation’s applicable tax-able year. An additional tax is imposed if an initial tax is imposed and at the close of the applicable taxable period, the foundation continues to hold excess business holdings. The amount of the additional tax is equal to 200 percent of such holdings. 
HOUSE BILL  The provision creates an exception to the excess business holdings rules for certain philanthropic business holdings. Specifi-cally, the tax on excess business holdings does not apply with respect to the holdings of a private foundation in any business en-terprise that, for the taxable year, satisfies the following requirements: (1) the owner-ship requirements; (2) the ‘‘all profits to charity’’ distribution requirement; and (3) the independent operation requirements. The ownership requirements are satisfied if: (1) all ownership interests in the business enterprise are held by the private foundation at all times during the taxable year; and (2) all the private foundation’s ownership inter-ests in the business enterprise were acquired not by purchase. The ‘‘all profits to charity’’ distribution requirement is satisfied if the business en-terprise, not later than 120 days after the close of the taxable year, distributes an amount equal to its net operating income for such taxable year to the private foundation. For this purpose, the net operating income of any business enterprise for any taxable year is an amount equal to the gross income of the business enterprise for the taxable year, reduced by the sum of: (1) the deduc-tions allowed by chapter 1 of the Code for the taxable year that are directly connected with the production of the income; (2) the tax imposed by chapter 1 on the business en-terprise for the taxable year; and (3) an amount for a reasonable reserve for working capital and other business needs of the busi-ness enterprise. The independent operation requirements are met if, at all times during the taxable year, the following three requirements are satisfied. First, no substantial contributor to the private foundation, or family member of such a contributor, is a director, officer, trustee, manager, employee, or contractor of the business enterprise (or an individual hav-ing powers or responsibilities similar to any of the foregoing). Second, at least a majority of the board of directors of the private foun-dation are not also directors or officers of the business enterprise or members of the family of a substantial contributor to the private foundation. Third, there is no loan outstanding from the business enterprise to a substantial contributor to the private foundation or a family member of such con-tributor. For purposes of the independent op-eration requirements, ‘‘substantial contrib-utor’’ has the meaning given to the term under section 4958(c)(3)(C), and family mem-bers are determined under section 4958(f)(4). The provision does not apply to the fol-lowing organizations: (1) donor advised funds

In addition, contributions to a sponsoring organization for maintenance in a donor advised fund are not eli-gible for a charitable deduction for income, gift, or estate tax purposes if the sponsoring organization is a Type III supporting organization (other than a functionally integrated Type III supporting organi-zation). In addition to satisfying generally applica-ble substantiation requirements under section 170(f), a donor must obtain, with respect to each charitable contribution to a sponsoring organization to be maintained in a donor advised fund, a contempora-neous written acknowledgment from the sponsoring organization providing that the sponsoring organiza-tion has exclusive legal control over the assets con-tributed. 
1281See sec. 4966(d)(2)(A). A donor advised fund does not include a fund or account that makes distribu-tions only to a single identified organization or gov-ernmental entity. A donor advised fund also does not include certain funds or accounts with respect to which a donor or donor advisor provides advice as to which individuals receive grants for travel, study, or other similar purposes. In addition, the Secretary may exempt a fund or account from treatment as a donor advised fund if such fund or account is advised by a committee not directly or indirectly controlled by a donor, donor advisor, or persons related to a or supporting organizations that are subject to the excess business holdings rules by rea-son of section 4943(e) or (f); (2) any trust de-scribed in section 4947(a)(1) (relating to char-itable trusts); or (3) any trust described in section 4947(a)(2) (relating to split-interest trusts). Effective date.—The provision is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  No provision. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement does not include the House bill provision. C. Requirements for Organizations Exempt From Tax 1. Section 501(c)(3) organizations permitted to make statements relating to political campaign in ordinary course of activities in carrying out exempt purpose (sec. 5201 of the House bill and sec. 501 of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  Section 501(c)(3) organizations Charitable organizations, i.e., organiza-tions described in section 501(c)(3), generally are exempt from Federal income tax and are eligible to receive tax deductible contribu-tions. A charitable organization must oper-ate primarily in pursuance of one or more tax-exempt purposes constituting the basis of its tax exemption.
1265The Code specifies such purposes as religious, charitable, sci-entific, testing for public safety, literary, or educational purposes, or to foster inter-national amateur sports competition, or for the prevention of cruelty to children or ani-mals.
1266In general, an organization is orga-nized and operated for charitable purposes if it provides relief for the poor and distressed or the underprivileged. In order to qualify as operating primarily for a purpose described in section 501(c)(3), an organization must sat-isfy the following operational requirements: (1) its net earnings may not inure to the ben-efit of any person in a position to influence the activities of the organization; (2) it must operate to provide a public benefit, not a pri-vate benefit;
1267(3) it may not be operated primarily to conduct an unrelated trade or business;
1268(4) it may not engage in sub-stantial legislative lobbying; and (5) it may not participate or intervene in any political campaign. Section 501(c)(3) organizations are classi-fied either as ‘‘public charities’’ or ‘‘private foundations.’’
1269Private foundations gen-erally are defined under section 509(a) as all organizations described in section 501(c)(3) other than an organization granted public charity status by reason of: (1) being a speci-fied type of organization (i.e., churches, edu-cational institutions, hospitals and certain other medical organizations, certain organi-zations providing assistance to colleges and universities, or a governmental unit); (2) re-ceiving a substantial part of its support from governmental units or direct or indirect con-tributions from the general public; or (3) pro-viding support to another section 501(c)(3) entity that is not a private foundation. In contrast to public charities, private founda-tions generally are funded from a limited number of sources (e.g., an individual, fam-ily, or corporation). Donors to private foun-dations and persons related to such donors together often control the operations of pri-vate foundations. Because private foundations receive sup-port from, and typically are controlled by, a small number of supporters, private founda-tions are subject to a number of anti-abuse rules and excise taxes not applicable to pub-lic charities.1270Public charities also have certain advantages over private foundations regarding the deductibility of contributions. Political campaign activities Charitable organizations may not partici-pate in, or intervene in (including the pub-lishing or distributing of statements), any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposi-tion to) any candidate for public office.
1271 The prohibition on such political campaign activity is absolute and, in general, includes activities such as making contributions to a candidate’s political campaign, endorse-ments of a candidate, lending employees to work in a political campaign, or providing facilities for use by a candidate. The abso-lute prohibition on campaign activities was added in 1954 by the so called ‘‘Johnson amendment.’’
1272Many other activities may constitute political campaign activity, de-pending on the facts and circumstances. The sanction for a violation of the prohibition is loss of the organization’s tax-exempt status. For organizations that engage in prohib-ited political campaign activity, the Code provides three penalties that may be applied either as alternatives to revocation of tax exemption or in addition to loss of tax-ex-empt status: an excise tax on political ex-penditures,
1273termination assessment of all taxes due,
1274and an injunction against fur-ther political expenditures.
1275 
HOUSE BILL  The provision modifies the present-law rules relating to political campaign activity by section 501(c)(3) organizations for the fol-lowing purposes: (1) section 501(c)(3) tax-ex-empt status; (2) qualifying as an eligible re-cipient of tax-deductible contributions for income,
1276gift,1277and estate tax1278pur- poses; and (3) application of the excise tax on political expenditures by section 501(c)(3) or-ganizations.
1279 For such purposes, an organization shall not fail to be treated as organized and oper-ated exclusively for a purpose described in section 501(c)(3), nor shall it be deemed to have participated in, or intervened in any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposi-tion to) any candidate for public office, sole-ly because of the content of any statement that: (A) is made in the ordinary course of the organization’s regular and customary ac-tivities in carrying out its exempt purpose; and (B) results in the organization incurring not more than de minimis incremental ex-penses. The provision does not apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2023. Effective date.—The provision is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2018. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  No provision. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement does not include the House bill provision. 2. Additional reporting requirements for donor advised fund sponsoring organiza-tions (sec. 5202 of the House bill and sec. 6033 of the Code) PRESENT LAW  Overview Some charitable organizations (including community foundations) establish accounts to which donors may contribute and there-after provide nonbinding advice or rec-ommendations with regard to distributions from the fund or the investment of assets in the fund. Such accounts are commonly re-ferred to as ‘‘donor advised funds.’’ Donors who make contributions to charities for maintenance in a donor advised fund gen-erally claim a charitable contribution deduc-tion at the time of the contribution.
1280Al- though sponsoring charities frequently per-mit donors (or other persons appointed by donors) to provide nonbinding recommenda-tions concerning the distribution or invest-ment of assets in a donor advised fund, spon-soring charities generally must have legal ownership and control of such assets fol-lowing the contribution. If the sponsoring charity does not have such control (or per-mits a donor to exercise control over amounts contributed), the donor’s contribu-tions may not qualify for a charitable deduc-tion, and, in the case of a community foun-dation, the contribution may be treated as being subject to a material restriction or condition by the donor. Statutory definition of a donor advised fund The Code defines a ‘‘donor advised fund’’ as a fund or account that is: (1) separately iden-tified by reference to contributions of a donor or donors; (2) owned and controlled by a sponsoring organization; and (3) with re-spect to which a donor (or any person ap-pointed or designated by such donor (a ‘‘donor advisor’’)) has, or reasonably expects to have, advisory privileges with respect to the distribution or investment of amounts held in the separately identified fund or ac-count by reason of the donor’s status as a donor. All three prongs of the definition must be met in order for a fund or account to be treated as a donor advised fund.

1291Alan Schenk, Victor Thuronyi, and Wei Cui, Value Added Tax: A Comparative Approach , Cam-bridge University Press, 2015. Consistent with the OECD International VAT/GST Guidelines , supra, the term VAT is used to refer to all broad-based final consumption taxes, regardless of the acronym used to identify. Thus, many countries that denominate their national consumption tax as a GST (general sales tax) are included in the estimate of the num-ber of countries with a VAT. 
1292Nearly all countries use the credit-invoice method of calculating value added to determine VAT liability. Under the credit-invoice method, a tax is imposed on the seller for all of its sales. The tax is calculated by applying the tax rate to the sales price of the good or service, and the amount of tax is generally disclosed on the sales invoice. A business credit is provided for all VAT levied on pur-chases of taxable goods and services ( i.e., ‘‘inputs’’) used in the seller’s business. The ultimate consumer (i.e., a non-business purchaser), however, does not receive a credit with respect to his or her purchases. The VAT credit for inputs prevents the imposition of multiple layers of tax with respect to the total final purchase price (i.e., a ‘‘cascading’’ of the VAT). As a result, the net tax paid at a particular stage of production or distribution is based on the value added by that taxpayer at that stage of production or distribution. In theory, the total amount of tax paid with respect to a good or service from all levels of production and distribution should equal the sales price of the good or service to the ultimate con-sumer multiplied by the VAT rate. In order to receive an input credit with respect to any purchase, a business purchaser is generally re-quired to possess an invoice from a seller that con-tains the name of the purchaser and indicates the amount of tax collected by the seller on the sale of the input to the purchaser. At the end of a reporting period, a taxpayer may calculate its tax liability by subtracting the cumulative amount of tax stated on its purchase invoices from the cumulative amount of tax stated on its sales invoices.

1283); (2) is not a private foundation (as defined in section 509(a)); and (3) maintains one or more donor advised funds.
1284 Reporting and disclosure Each sponsoring organization must dis-close on its information return: (1) the total number of donor advised funds it owns; (2) the aggregate value of assets held in those funds at the end of the organization’s tax-able year; and (3) the aggregate contribu-tions to and grants made from those funds during the year.
1285In addition, when seek-ing recognition of its tax-exempt status, a sponsoring organization must disclose whether it intends to maintain donor advised funds.

HOUSE BILL  The provision requires a sponsoring organi-zation to report additional information on its annual information return (Form 990). Sponsoring organizations must indicate: (1) the average amount of grants made from donor advised funds during the taxable year (expressed as a percentage of the value of as-sets held in such funds at the beginning of the taxable year), and (2) whether the orga-nization has a policy with respect to donor advised funds relating to the frequency and minimum level of distributions from donor advised funds. The sponsoring organization must include with its return a copy of any such policy. Effective date.—The provision is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  No provision. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement does not include the House bill provision. INTERNATIONAL TAX PROVISIONS PRESENT LAW The following discussion provides an over-view of general principles of taxation of cross-border activity as well as a detailed ex-planation of provisions in present law that are relevant to the provisions in the bill. A. General Overview of International Principles of Taxation International law generally recognizes the right of each sovereign nation to prescribe rules to regulate conduct with a sufficient nexus to the sovereign nation. The nexus may be based on nationality of the actor, i.e., a nexus between said conduct and a per-son (whether natural or juridical) with a connection to the sovereign nation, or it may be territorial, i.e., a nexus between the conduct to be regulated and the territory where the conduct occurs.
1287For example, most legal systems respect limits on the ex-tent to which their measures may be given extraterritorial effect. The broad acceptance of such norms extends to authority to regu-late cross-border trade and economic deal-ings, including taxation. The exercise of sovereign jurisdiction is usually based on either nationality of the person whose conduct is regulated or the ter-ritory in which the conduct or activity oc-curs. These concepts have been refined and, in varying combinations, adapted to form the principles for determining whether suffi-cient nexus with a jurisdiction exists to con-clude that the jurisdiction may enforce its right to impose a tax. The elements of nexus and the nomenclature of the principles may differ based on the type of tax in question. Taxes are categorized as either direct taxes or indirect taxes. The former category gen-erally refers to those taxes that are imposed directly on a person (‘‘capitation tax’’), prop-erty, or income from property and that can-not be shifted to another person by the tax-payer. In contrast, indirect taxes are taxes on consumption or production of goods or services, for which a taxpayer may shift re-sponsibility to another person. Such taxes include sales or use taxes, value-added taxes, or customs duties.1288 Although governments have imposed direct taxes on property and indirect taxes and du-ties on specific transactions since ancient times, the history of direct taxes in the form of an income tax is relatively recent.
1289 When determining how to allocate the right to tax a particular item of income, most ju-risdictions consider principles based on ei-ther source (territory or situs of the income) or residence (nationality of the taxpayer).
1290 By contrast, when the authority to collect indirect taxes in the form of sales taxes or value added taxes is under consideration, ju-risdictions analyze the taxing rights in terms of the origin principle or destination principle. The balance of this Part I.A de-scribes the principles in more detail and how jurisdictions resolve claims of overlapping jurisdiction. 1. Origin and destination principles Indirect taxes that are imposed based on the place where production of goods or serv-ices occur, irrespective of the location of the persons who own the means of production, and where the goods and services go after being produced, are examples of origin-based taxes. If, instead, authority to tax a trans-action or service is dependent on the loca-tion of use or consumption of the goods or services, the tax system is an example of a destination-based tax. The most common form of a destination-based tax is the des-tination-based value-added tax (‘‘VAT’’). Over 160 countries have adopted a VAT,
1291 which is generally a tax imposed and col-lected on the ‘‘value added’’ at every stage in the production and distribution of a good or service. Although there are several ways to compute the taxable base for a VAT, the amount of value added can generally be thought of as the difference between the value of sales (outputs) and purchases (in-puts) of a business.1292The United States does not have a VAT, nor is there a Federal sales or use tax. However, the majority of the States have enacted sales or use taxes, including both origin-based taxes and des-tination-based taxes.
1293 With respect to cross-border transactions, the OECD has recommended that the des-tination principle be adopted for all indirect taxes, in part to conform to the treatment of such transactions for purposes of customs duties. The OECD defines the destination principle as ‘‘the principle whereby, for con-sumption tax purposes, internationally trad-ed services and intangibles should be taxed according to the rules of the jurisdiction of consumption.’’
1294A jurisdiction may deter-mine the place of use or consumption by adopting the convention that the place of business or residence of a customer is the place of consumption. Use of such proxies are needed to determine the location of busi-nesses that are juridical entities, which are more able than natural persons to move the location of use of goods, services or intangi-bles in response to imposition of tax. 2. Source and residence principles Exercise of taxing authority based on a person’s residence may be based on status as

1295The current U.S. Model treaty was published February 17, 2016, and is available at https:// www.treasury.gov/ resource-center/ tax-policy/ treaties/ Documents/Treaty-US%20Model-2016.pdf ; the Preamble is available at https://www.treasury.gov/resource-cen-ter/tax-policy/treaties/Documents/Preamble- US%20Model-2016.pdf. The U.S. Model treaty is up-dated periodically to reflect developments in the ne-gotiating position of the United States. Such changes include provisions that were successfully included in bilateral treaties concluded by the United States, as well as new proposed measures not yet included in a bilateral agreement. 
1296Although U.S. courts extend comity to foreign judgments in some instances, they are not required to recognize or assist in enforcement of foreign judg-ments for collection of taxes, consistent with the common law ‘‘revenue rule’’ in Holman v. Johnson, 1 Cowp. 341, 98 Eng. Rep. 1120 (K.B.1775). American Law Institute, Restatement (Third) of Foreign Rela-tions Law of the United States , sec. 483, (1987). The rule retains vitality in U.S. case law. Pasquantino v. United States, 544 U.S. 349; 125 S. Ct. 1766; 161 L. Ed. 2d 619 (2005) (a conviction for criminal wire fraud arising from an intent to defraud Canadian tax au-thorities was found not to conflict ‘‘with any well- established revenue rule principle[,]’’ and thus was not in derogation of the revenue rule). To the extent it is abrogated, it is done so in bilateral treaties, to ensure reciprocity. At present, the United States has such agreements in force with five jurisdictions: Canada; Denmark; France; Netherlands; and Swe-den.

1305Sec. 7874. a national, resident, or domiciliary of a ju-risdiction and may reach worldwide activi-ties of such persons. As such, it is the broad-est assertion of taxing authority. For indi-viduals, the test for residence may depend upon nationality, or a physical presence test, or some combination of the two. For all other persons, determining residency may require more complex consideration of the level of activities within a jurisdiction, man-agement, control or place of incorporation. Such rules generally reflect a policy decision about the requisite level of activity within, or contact with, a jurisdiction by a person that is sufficient to warrant assertion of tax-ing jurisdiction. Source-based exercise of taxing authority taxes income from activities that occur, or property that is located, within the territory of the taxing jurisdiction. If a person con-ducts business or owns property in a jurisdic-tion, or if a transaction occurs in whole or in part in a jurisdiction, the resulting taxation may require allocation and apportionment of expenses attributable to the activity in order to ensure that only the portion of profits that have the required nexus with the terri-tory are subject to tax. Most jurisdictions, including the United States, have rules for determining the source of items of income and expense in a broad range of categories such as compensation for services, dividends, interest, royalties and gains. Regardless of which of these two bases of taxing authority is chosen by a jurisdiction, a jurisdiction’s determination of whether a transaction, activity or person is subject to tax requires that the jurisdiction establish the limits on its assertion of authority to tax. 3. Resolving overlapping or conflicting juris-diction to tax Countries have developed norms about what constitutes a reasonable regulatory ac-tion by a sovereign state that will be re-spected by other sovereign states. Consensus on what constitutes a reasonable limit on the extent of one state’s jurisdiction helps to minimize the risk of conflicts arising as a re-sult of extraterritorial action by a state or overlapping exercise of authority by states. Mechanisms to eliminate double taxation have developed to address those situations in which the source and residency determina-tions of the respective jurisdictions result in duplicative assertion of taxing authority. For example, asymmetry between different standards adopted in two countries for deter-mining residency of persons, source of in-come, or other basis for taxation may result in income that is subject to taxation in both jurisdictions. When the rules of two or more countries overlap, potential double taxation is usually mitigated by operation of bilateral tax trea-ties or by legislative measures permitting credit for taxes paid to another jurisdiction. The United States is a partner in numerous bilateral agreements that have as their ob-jective the avoidance of international double taxation and the prevention of tax avoidance and evasion. Another related objective of U.S. tax treaties is the removal of the bar-riers to trade, capital flows, and commercial travel that may be caused by overlapping tax jurisdictions and by the burdens of com-plying with the tax laws of a jurisdiction when a person’s contacts with, and income derived from, that jurisdiction are minimal. The United States Model Income Tax Con-vention (‘‘U.S. Model Treaty of 2016’’) with an accompanying Preamble by the Depart-ment of Treasury, reflects the most recent comprehensive statement of U.S. negotiating position with respect to tax treaties.
1295Bi-lateral agreements are also used to permit limited mutual administrative assistance be-tween jurisdictions.1296 In addition to entering into bilateral trea-ties, countries have worked in multilateral organizations to develop common principles to alleviate double taxation. Those prin-ciples are generally reflected in the provi-sions of the Model Tax Convention on In-come and on Capital of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (the ‘‘OECD Model treaty’’),
1297a precursor of which was first developed by a predecessor organization in 1958, which in turn has ante-cedents from work by the League of Nations in the 1920s.
1298As a consensus document, the OECD Model treaty is intended to serve as a model for countries to use in negotiating a bilateral treaty that would settle issues of double taxation as well as to avoid inappro-priate double nontaxation. The provisions have developed over time as practice with actual bilateral treaties leads to unexpected results and new issues are raised by parties to the treaties.
1299 4. International principles as applied in the U.S. system Present law combines taxation of all U.S. persons on their worldwide income, whether derived in the United States or abroad, with limited deferral of taxation of income earned by foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies and source-based taxation of the U.S.-source in-come of nonresident aliens and foreign enti-ties. Under this system (sometimes described as the U.S. hybrid system), the application of the Code differs depending on whether in-come arises from outbound investment or in-bound investment. Outbound investment re-fers to the foreign activities of U.S. persons, while inbound investment is investment by foreign persons in U.S. assets or activities, although certain rules are common to both inbound and outbound activities. B. Principles Common to Inbound and Outbound Taxation Although the U.S. tax rules differ depend-ing on whether the activity in question is in-bound or outbound, there are certain con-cepts that apply to both inbound and out-bound investment. Such areas include the transfer pricing rules, entity classification, the rules for determination of source, and whether a corporation is foreign or domestic. 1. Residence U.S. persons are subject to tax on their worldwide income. The Code defines U.S. person to include all U.S. citizens and resi-dents as well as domestic entities such as partnerships, corporations, estates and cer-tain trusts.1300The term ‘‘resident’’ is de-fined only with respect to natural persons. Noncitizens who are lawfully admitted as permanent residents of the United States in accordance with immigration laws (colloquially referred to as green card hold-ers) are treated as residents for tax purposes. In addition, noncitizens who meet a substan-tial presence test and are not otherwise ex-empt from U.S. taxation are also taxable as U.S. residents.
1301 For legal entities, the Code determines whether an entity is subject to U.S. taxation on its worldwide income on the basis of its place of organization. For purposes of U.S. tax law, a corporation or partnership is treated as domestic if it is organized or cre-ated under the laws of the United States or of any State, unless, in the case of a partner-ship, the Secretary prescribes otherwise by regulation.
1302All other partnerships and corporations (that is, those organized under the laws of foreign countries) are treated as foreign.
1303In contrast, place of organization is not determinative of residence under tax-ing jurisdictions that use factors such as situs, management and control to determine residence. As a result, legal entities may have more than one tax residence, or, in some case, no residence.
1304Only domestic corporations are subject to U.S. tax on a worldwide basis. Foreign corporations are taxed only on income that has a sufficient connection with the United States. Tax benefits otherwise available to a do-mestic corporation that migrates its tax home from the United States to foreign ju-risdiction may be denied to such corpora-tion, in which case it continues to be treated as a domestic corporation for ten years fol-lowing such migration.
1305These sanctions generally apply to a transaction in which, pursuant to a plan or a series of related transactions: (1) a domestic corporation be-comes a subsidiary of a foreign-incorporated entity or otherwise transfers substantially all of its properties to such an entity in a transaction completed after March 4, 2003; (2) the former shareholders of the domestic cor-poration hold (by reason of the stock they

1311The check-the-box regulations replaced Treas. Reg. sec. 301.7701–2, as in effect prior to 1997, under which the classification of unincorporated entities for Federal tax purposes was determined on the basis of a four characteristics indicative of status as a corporation: continuity of life, centralization of management, limited liability, and free transfer-ability of interests. An entity that possessed three or more of these characteristics was treated as a corporation; if it possessed two or fewer, then it was treated as a partnership. Thus, to achieve character-ization as a partnership under this system, tax-payers needed to arrange the governing instruments of an entity in such a way as to eliminate two of these corporate characteristics. The advent and pro-liferation of limited liability companies (‘‘LLCs’’) under State laws allowed business owners to create customized entities that possessed a critical com-mon feature—limited liability for investors—as well as other corporate characteristics the owners found desirable. As a consequence, classification was effec-tively elective for well-advised taxpayers.

1326Sec. 863(b). A taxpayer may elect one of three methods for allocating and apportioning income as U.S.- or foreign-source: (1) the 50–50 method under which 50 percent of the income from the sale of in-ventory property in such a situation is attributable to the production activities and 50 percent to the sales activities, with the income sourced based on the location of those activities; (2) independent fac-tory price (‘‘IFP’’) method under which, in certain circumstances, an IFP may be established by the taxpayer to determine income from production ac-tivities; (3) the books and records method under which, with advance permission, the taxpayer may use books of account to detail the allocation of re-ceipts and expenditures between production and sales activities.

1306 The Treasury Department and the IRS have promulgated detailed guidance, through both regulations and several no-tices, addressing these requirements under section 7874 since the section was enacted in 2004,
1307and have sought to expand the reach of the section or reduce the tax benefits of inversion transactions. For example, Notice 2014–52 announced Treasury’s and the IRS’s intention to issue regulations and took a two-pronged approached. First, it addressed the treatment of cross-border combination transactions themselves. Second, it ad-dressed post-transaction steps that tax-payers may undertake with respect to US- owned foreign subsidiaries making it more difficult to access foreign earnings without incurring added U.S. tax. On November 19, 2015, Treasury and the IRS issued Notice 2015–79, which announced their intent to issue further regulations to limit cross-bor-der merger transactions, expanding on the guidance issued in Notice 2014–52. In 2016, Treasury and the IRS issued proposed and temporary regulations that incorporate the rules previously announced in Notice 2014–52 and Notice 2015–79 and a new multiple domes-tic entity acquisition rule.
1308 In early 2017, Treasury issued final and temporary regulations
1309that adopt, with few changes, the 2016 temporary and pro-posed regulations. 2. Entity classification Certain entities are eligible to elect their classification for Federal tax purposes under the ‘‘check-the-box’’ regulations adopted in 1997.
1310Those regulations simplified the en-tity classification process for both taxpayers and the IRS by making the entity classifica-tion of unincorporated entities explicitly elective in most instances.
1311The eligibility to elect and the breadth of an entity’s choices depend upon whether it is a ‘‘per se corporation’’ and its number of beneficial owners. Foreign as well as domestic entities may make the election. As a result, it is pos-sible for an entity that operates across coun-tries to be treated as a hybrid entity. A hy-brid entity is one which is treated as a flow- through or disregarded entity for U.S. tax purposes but as a corporation for foreign tax purposes. For ‘‘reverse hybrid entities,’’ the opposite is true. The election can affect the determination of the source of the income, availability of tax credits, and other tax at-tributes. 3. Source of income rules The rules for determining the source of certain types of income are specified in the Code and described briefly below. Various factors determine the source of income for U.S. tax purposes, including the status or na-tionality of the payor, the status or nation-ality of the recipient, the location of the re-cipient’s activities that generate the income, and the location of the assets that generate the income. To the extent that the source of income is not specified by statute, the Treas-ury Secretary may promulgate regulations that explain the appropriate treatment. However, many items of income are not ex-plicitly addressed by either the Code or Treasury regulations, sometimes resulting in nontaxation of the income. On several occa-sions, courts have determined the source of such items by applying the rule for the type of income to which the disputed income is most closely analogous, based on all facts and circumstances.1312 Interest Interest is derived from U.S. sources if it is paid by the United States or any agency or instrumentality thereof, a State or any po-litical subdivision thereof, or the District of Columbia. Interest is also from U.S. sources if it is paid by a resident or a domestic cor-poration on a bond, note, or other interest- bearing obligation.
1313Special rules apply to treat as foreign-source certain amounts paid on deposits with foreign commercial banking branches of U.S. corporations or partner-ships and certain other amounts paid by for-eign branches of domestic financial institu-tions.
1314Interest paid by the U.S. branch of a foreign corporation is also treated as U.S.- source income.
1315 Dividends Dividend income is generally sourced by reference to the payor’s place of incorpora-tion.
1316Thus, dividends paid by a domestic corporation are generally treated as entirely U.S.-source income. Similarly, dividends paid by a foreign corporation are generally treated as entirely foreign-source income. Under a special rule, dividends from certain foreign corporations that conduct U.S. busi-nesses are treated in part as U.S.-source in-come.1317 Rents and royalties Rental income is sourced by reference to the location or place of use of the leased property.
1318The nationality or the country of residence of the lessor or lessee does not affect the source of rental income. Rental in-come from property located or used in the United States (or from any interest in such property) is U.S.-source income, regardless of whether the property is real or personal, intangible or tangible. Royalties are sourced in the place of use of (or the place of privilege to use) the property for which the royalties are paid.
1319This source rule applies to royalties for the use of either tangible or intangible property, in-cluding patents, copyrights, secret processes, formulas, goodwill, trademarks, trade names, and franchises. Income from sales of personal property Subject to significant exceptions, income from the sale of personal property is sourced on the basis of the residence of the seller.
1320 For this purpose, special definitions of the terms ‘‘U.S. resident’’ and ‘‘nonresident’’ are provided. A nonresident is defined as any person who is not a U.S. resident,
1321while the term ‘‘U.S. resident’’ comprises any ju-ridical entity which is a U.S. person, all U.S. citizens, as well as any individual who is a U.S. resident without a tax home in a foreign country or a nonresident alien with a tax home in the United States.
1322As a result, nonresident includes any foreign corpora-tion.
1323 Several special rules apply. For example, income from the sale of inventory property is generally sourced to the place of sale, which is determined by where title to the property passes.
1324However, if the sale is by a nonresident and is attributable to an office or other fixed place of business in the United States, the sale is treated as income from U.S. sources without regard to the place of sale, unless it is sold for use, disposition, or consumption outside the United States and a foreign office materially participates in the sale.
1325Income from the sale of inventory property that a taxpayer produces (in whole or in part) in the United States and sells out-side the United States, or that a taxpayer produces (in whole or in part) outside the United States and sells in the United States, is treated as partly U.S.-source and partly foreign-source.

1334Sec. 863(c). 1335U.S. law on navigation is codified in U.S. Code at title 33, and is consistent with the body of inter-national maritime law. The normative principles of international maritime law for determining the maritime zones and territorial sovereignty over seas are embodied in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, first opened for signature in 1982. Since 1983, the Executive Branch has agreed that the treaty is generally consistent with existing international norms of the law of the sea and that the United States would act in conformity to the principles of the treaty other than those portions re-garding deep seabed exploitation, even in the ab-sence of ratification of the treaty. 
1336Due to the regulatory framework for aviation, an international flight must either originate or con-clude in the country of residence of the airline’s owner, where income tax for the international flight is assessed. In contrast to international shipping, international aviation cannot be carried out using flags-of-convenience. Thus, although tax law treats shipping and aviation similarly, the differences be-tween the two industries and the applicable regu-latory regimes produce different tax outcomes. Full territorial sovereignty applies within 12 nautical miles of one’s coast; the contiguous waters beyond 12 nautical miles but up to 24 nautical miles are sub-ject to some regulation. Within 200 nautical miles, a country may assert an economic zone for exploi-tation of living marine resources and some minerals. Beyond 200 nautical miles are the ‘‘high seas’’ in which no sovereign state may assert exclusive juris-diction. 
1337Sec. 887(a). Special rules for determining whether transportation income is effectively con-nected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business are also provided, and for coordinating the applica-tion of sections 871, 882, and 887.

May 2, 2011), in which the Tax Court held that fees paid by a domestic corporation to its foreign parent with respect to guarantees issued by the parent for the debts of the domestic corporation were more closely analogous to compensation for services than to in-terest, and determined that the source of the fees should be determined by reference to the residence of the foreign parent-guarantor. As a result, the in-come was treated as income from foreign sources. 
1344For a detailed description of the U.S. transfer pricing rules, see Joint Committee on Taxation, Present Law and Background Related to Possible In-come Shifting and Transfer Pricing (JCX–37–10), July 20, 2010, pp. 18–50. In determining the source of gain or loss from the sale or exchange of an interest in a foreign partnership, the IRS has taken the position that to the extent that there is un-realized gain attributable to partnership as-sets that are effectively connected with the U.S. business, the foreign person’s gain or loss from the sale or exchange of a partner-ship interest is effectively connected gain or loss to the extent of the partner’s distribu-tive share of such unrealized gain or loss, and not capital gain or loss. Similarly, to the extent that the partner’s distributive share of unrealized gain is attributable to a permanent establishment of the partnership under an applicable treaty provision, it may be subject to U.S. tax under a treaty.
1327 Gain on the sale of depreciable property is divided between U.S.-source and foreign- source in the same ratio that the deprecia-tion was previously deductible for U.S. tax purposes.
1328Payments received on sales of intangible property are sourced in the same manner as royalties to the extent the pay-ments are contingent on the productivity, use, or disposition of the intangible prop-erty.
1329 Personal services income Compensation for labor or personal serv-ices is generally sourced to the place-of-per-formance. Thus, compensation for labor or personal services performed in the United States generally is treated as U.S.-source in-come, subject to an exception for amounts that meet certain de minimis criteria.
1330 Compensation for services performed both within and without the United States is allo-cated between U.S.-and foreign-source.
1331 Insurance income Underwriting income from issuing insur-ance or annuity contracts generally is treat-ed as U.S.-source income if the contract in-volves property in, liability arising out of an activity in, or the lives or health of residents of, the United States.
1332 Transportation income Transportation income is any income de-rived from, or in connection with, the use (or hiring or leasing for use) of a vessel or air-craft (or a container used in connection therewith) or the performance of services di-rectly related to such use.
1333That definition does not encompass land transport except to the extent that it is directly related to ship-ping by vessel or aircraft, but regulations ex-tend a similar rule for determining the source of income from transportation serv-ices other than shipping or aviation. Sources rules generally provide that income from furnishing transportation that both begins and ends in the United States is U.S.-source income,
1334and 50-percent of income attrib-utable to transportation that either begins or the ends in the United States is treated as U.S.-source income. However, to the extent that the operator of a shipping or cruise line is foreign, its ownership structure and the maritime law1335applicable for determining what constitutes international shipping as well as specific income tax provisions com-bine to create an industry-specific departure from the rules generally applicable.
1336 A subcategory of transportation income, ‘‘U.S. source gross transportation income’’ is subject to taxation on a gross basis at the rate of four percent.
1337Income is within the scope of this special tax if it is considered to be U.S. source because travel begins or ends in the United States, is not effectively con-nected, and is not of a kind to which the ex-emption from tax applies.
1338 An exemption from U.S. tax is provided for transportation income of foreign persons from countries that extend reciprocal relief to U.S. persons. A nonresident alien indi-vidual with income from the international operation of a ship may qualify, provided that the foreign country in which such indi-vidual is resident grants an equivalent ex-emption to individual residents of the United States.
1339A similar exemption from U.S. tax is provided for gross income derived by a for-eign corporation from the international op-eration of an aircraft, provided that the for-eign country in which the corporation is or-ganized grants an equivalent exemption to corporations organized in the United States.
1340 To determine whether income from shipping or aviation is eligible for an exemption under section 883, one must exam-ine the extent to which the foreign jurisdic-tion has extended reciprocity for U.S. busi-nesses; whether the party claiming an ex-emption is eligible for the tax relief; and the nature of the activities that give rise to the income. Income from space or ocean activities or inter-national communications In the case of a foreign person, generally no income from a space or ocean activity or from international communications is treat-ed as U.S.-source income.
1341With respect to the latter, an exception is provided if the for-eign person maintains an office or other fixed place of business in the United States, in which case the international communica-tions income attributable to such fixed place of business is treated as U.S.-source in-come.1342For U.S. persons, all income from space or ocean activities and 50 percent of in-come from international communications is treated as U.S.-source income. Amounts received with respect to guarantees of indebtedness Amounts received, directly or indirectly, from a noncorporate resident or from a do-mestic corporation for the provision of a guarantee of indebtedness of such person are income from U.S. sources.
1343This includes payments that are made indirectly for the provision of a guarantee. For example, U.S.- source income under this rule includes a guarantee fee paid by a foreign bank to a for-eign corporation for the foreign corpora-tion’s guarantee of indebtedness owed to the bank by the foreign corporation’s domestic subsidiary, where the cost of the guarantee fee is passed on to the domestic subsidiary through, for instance, additional interest charged on the indebtedness. In this situa-tion, the domestic subsidiary has paid the guarantee fee as an economic matter through higher interest costs, and the addi-tional interest payments made by the sub-sidiary are treated as indirect payments of the guarantee fee and, therefore, as income from U.S. sources. Such U.S.-source income also includes amounts received from a foreign person, whether directly or indirectly, for the provi-sion of a guarantee of indebtedness of that foreign person if the payments received are connected with income of such person that is effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business. Amounts received from a foreign person, whether directly or indirectly, for the provision of a guarantee of that person’s debt, are treated as foreign- source income if they are not from sources within the United States under section 861(a)(9). 4. Intercompany transfers Transfer pricing A basic U.S. tax principle applicable in di-viding profits from transactions between re-lated taxpayers is that the amount of profit allocated to each related taxpayer must be measured by reference to the amount of prof-it that a similarly situated taxpayer would realize in similar transactions with unre-lated parties. The transfer pricing rules of section 482 and the accompanying Treasury regulations are intended to preserve the U.S. tax base by ensuring that taxpayers do not shift income properly attributable to the United States to a related foreign company through pricing that does not reflect an arm’s-length result.
1344Similarly, the domes-tic laws of most U.S. trading partners in-clude rules to limit income shifting through transfer pricing. The arm’s-length standard is difficult to administer in situations in

1345The term ‘‘related’’ as used herein refers to re-lationships described in section 482, which refers to ‘‘two or more organizations, trades or businesses (whether or not incorporated, whether or not orga-nized in the United States, and whether or not affili-ated) owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the same interests.’’ 
1346Section 1059A buttresses section 482 by limiting the extent to which costs used to determine custom valuation can also be used to determine basis in property imported from a related party. A taxpayer that imports property from a related party may not assign a value to the property for cost purposes that exceeds its customs value.

1349See, T.D. 9803, 81 F.R. 91012 (December 17, 2016). Treas. Reg. sec. 1.367(d)–1(b) now provides that the rules of section 367(d) apply to transfers of intan-gible property as defined under Treas. Sec. 1.367(a)– 1(d)(5) after September 14, 2015, and to any transfers occurring before that date resulting from entity classification elections filed on or after September 15, 2015. Noting that commenters on the regulations had cited legislative history that contemplated ac-tive business exceptions, Treasury announced the reconsideration of the rule.

1353Commissioner v. Wodehouse, 337 U.S. 369, 388–89 (1949). After reviewing legislative history of the Rev-enue Act of 1936, the Supreme Court noted that Con-gress expressly intended to limit taxes on non-resident aliens to taxes that could be readily col-lectible, i.e., subject to withholding, in response to ‘‘a theoretical system impractical of administration in a great number of cases. H.R. Rep. No. 2475, 74th Cong., 2d Sess. 9–10 (1936).’’ In doing so, the Court re-jected P.G. Wodehouse’s arguments that an advance royalty payment was not within the purview of the statutory definition of FDAP income.

1356Sec. 883(a)(1). In addition, to the extent pro-vided in regulations, income from shipping and avia-tion is not subject to the four-percent gross basis tax if the income is of a type that is not subject to the reciprocal exemption for net basis taxation. See sec. 887(b)(1). Comparable rules under section 872(b)(1) apply to income of nonresident alien indi-viduals from shipping operations. 
1357Although technically insurance premiums paid to a foreign insurer or reinsurer are FDAP income, they are exempt from withholding under Treas. Reg. sec. 1.1441–2(a)(7) if the insurance contract is subject to the excise tax under section 4371. Treas. Reg. secs. 1.1441–2(b)(1)(i) and 1.1441–2(b)(2). 
1358For purposes of this rule, whether a person is considered a resident in the United States is deter-mined by application of the rules under section 7701(b). 
1359Sec. 871(a)(2). In addition, certain capital gains from sales of U.S. real property interests are subject to tax as effectively connected income (or in some instances as dividend income) under the Foreign In-vestment in Real Property Tax Act of 1980 (‘‘FIRPTA’’). 
1360Secs. 871(a)(1)(D), 881(a)(4).

1363Secs. 871(g)(1)(B), 881(a)(3); Treas. Reg. sec. 1.1441–1(b)(4)(iv). which no unrelated party market prices exist for transactions between related parties. When a foreign person with U.S. activities has transactions with related U.S. taxpayers, the amount of income attributable to U.S. activities is determined in part by the same transfer pricing rules of section 482 that apply when U.S. persons with foreign activi-ties transact with related foreign taxpayers. Section 482 authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to allocate income, deductions, credits, or allowances among related busi-ness entities
1345when necessary to clearly reflect income or otherwise prevent tax avoidance, and comprehensive Treasury reg-ulations under that section adopt the arm’s- length standard as the method for deter-mining whether allocations are appro-priate.
1346The regulations generally attempt to identify the respective amounts of taxable income of the related parties that would have resulted if the parties had been unre-lated parties dealing at arm’s length. For in-come from intangible property, section 482 provides ‘‘in the case of any transfer (or li-cense) of intangible property (within the meaning of section 936(h)(3)(B)), the income with respect to such transfer or license shall be commensurate with the income attrib-utable to the intangible.’’ By requiring in-clusion in income of amounts commensurate with the income attributable to the intan-gible, Congress was responding to concerns regarding the effectiveness of the arm’s- length standard with respect to intangible property—including, in particular, high-prof-it-potential intangibles.
1347 Gain recognition on outbound transfers If a transfer of intangible property to a for-eign affiliate occurs in connection with cer-tain corporate transactions, nonrecognition rules that may otherwise apply are sus-pended. The transferor of intangible property must recognize gain from the transfer as though he had sold the intangible (regardless of the stage of development of the intangible property) in exchange for payments contin-gent on the use, productivity or disposition of the transferred property in amounts that would have been received either annually over the useful life of the property or upon disposition of the property after the trans-fer.
1348The appropriate amounts of those im-puted payments are determined using trans-fer-pricing principles. Final regulations issued in 2016 eliminate an exception under temporary regulations that permitted non-recognition of gain from outbound transfers of foreign goodwill and going concern value. However, the Secretary announced that rein-statement of an exception for active trade or business is under consideration for cases with little potential for abuse and adminis-trative difficulties.
1349 C. U.S. Tax Rules Applicable to Nonresident Aliens and Foreign Corporations (Inbound) Nonresident aliens and foreign corpora-tions are generally subject to U.S. tax only on their U.S.-source income. Thus, the source and type of income received by a for-eign person generally determines whether there is any U.S. income tax liability and the mechanism by which it is taxed. The U.S. tax rules for U.S. activities of foreign taxpayers apply differently to two broad types of income: U.S.-source income that is ‘‘fixed or determinable annual or periodical gains, profits, and income’’ (‘‘FDAP in-come’’) or income that is ‘‘effectively con-nected with the conduct of a trade or busi-ness within the United States’’ (‘‘ECI’’). FDAP income generally is subject to a 30- percent gross-basis tax withheld at its source, while ECI is generally subject to the same U.S. tax rules that apply to business income derived by U.S. persons. That is, de-ductions are permitted in determining tax-able ECI, which is then taxed at the same rates applicable to U.S. persons. Much FDAP income and similar income is, however, ex-empt from tax or is subject to a reduced rate of tax under the Code1350or a bilateral in-come tax treaty.
1351 1. Gross-basis taxation of U.S.-source income. Non-business income received by foreign persons from U.S. sources is generally sub-ject to tax on a gross basis at a rate of 30 percent, which is collected by withholding at the source of the payment. As explained below, the categories of income subject to the 30-percent tax and the categories for which withholding is required are generally coextensive, with the result that deter-mining the withholding tax liability deter-mines the substantive liability. The income of non-resident aliens or for-eign corporations that is subject to tax at a rate of 30-percent includes FDAP income that is not effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business.
1352The items enumerated in defining FDAP income are illustrative; the common characteristic of types of FDAP income is that taxes with respect to the income may be readily com-puted and collected at the source, in con-trast to the administrative difficulty in-volved in determining the seller’s basis and resulting gain from sales of property.
1353The words ‘‘annual or periodical’’ are ‘‘merely generally descriptive’’ of the payments that could be within the purview of the statute and do not preclude application of the with-holding tax to one-time, lump sum payments to nonresident aliens.
1354 With respect to income from shipping, the gross basis tax potentially applicable is four percent,1355unless the income is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business, and thus subject to the graduated rates, as deter-mined under rules specific to U.S.-source gross transportation income rather than the more broadly applicable rules defining effec-tively connected income in section 864(c). Even if the income is within the purview of those special rules, it may nevertheless be exempt if the income is derived from the international operation of a ship or aircraft by a foreign entity organized in a jurisdic-tion which provides a reciprocal exemption to U.S. entities.
1356 Types of FDAP income FDAP income encompasses a broad range of types of gross income, but has limited ap-plication to gains on sales of property, in-cluding market discount on bonds and option premiums.
1357Capital gains received by non-resident aliens present in the United States for fewer than 183 days are generally treated as foreign source and are thus not subject to U.S. tax, unless the gains are effectively con-nected with a U.S. trade or business; capital gains received by nonresident aliens present in the United States for 183 days or more
1358 that are treated as income from U.S. sources are subject to gross-basis taxation.
1359In contrast, U.S-source gains from the sale or exchange of intangibles are subject to tax and withholding if they are contingent upon the productivity of the property sold and are not effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business.
1360 Interest on bank deposits may qualify for exemption on two grounds, depending on where the underlying principal is held on de-posit. Interest paid with respect to deposits with domestic banks and savings and loan associations, and certain amounts held by insurance companies, are U.S.-source income but are not subject to the U.S. tax when paid to a foreign person, unless the interest is ef-fectively connected with a U.S. trade or busi-ness of the recipient.
1361Interest on deposits with foreign branches of domestic banks and domestic savings and loan associations is not treated as U.S.-source income and is thus ex-empt from U.S. tax (regardless of whether the recipient is engaged in a U.S. trade or business).
1362Similarly, interest and original issue discount on certain short-term obliga-tions is also exempt from U.S. tax when paid to a foreign person.
1363Additionally, there is

Thus, if a U.S. insurer or reinsurer reinsures a U.S. risk with a foreign reinsurer, and that foreign reinsurer in turn reinsures the risk with a second foreign reinsurer, the excise tax ap-plies to both the premium to the first foreign rein-surer and the premium to the second foreign rein-surer. In addition, if the first foreign reinsurer is resident in a jurisdiction with a tax treaty con-taining an excise tax exemption, the revenue ruling provides that the excise tax still applies to both payments to the extent that the transaction vio-lates an anti-conduit rule in the applicable tax trea-ty. Even if no violation of an anti-conduit rule oc-curs, under the revenue ruling, the excise tax still 
applies to the premiums paid to the second foreign reinsurer, unless the second foreign reinsurer is itself entitled to an excise tax exemption.

1364 Although FDAP income includes U.S.- source portfolio interest, such interest is specifically exempt from the 30-percent gross-basis tax. Portfolio interest is any in-terest (including original issue discount) that is paid on an obligation that is in reg-istered form and for which the beneficial owner has provided to the U.S. withholding agent a statement certifying that the bene-ficial owner is not a U.S. person.
1365For obli- gations issued before March 19, 2012, port-folio interest also includes interest paid on an obligation that is not in registered form, provided that the obligation is shown to be targeted to foreign investors under the con-ditions sufficient to establish deductibility of the payment of such interest.
1366Portfolio interest, however, does not include interest received by a 10-percent shareholder,
1367cer- tain contingent interest,
1368interest received by a controlled foreign corporation from a related person,
1369or interest received by a bank on an extension of credit made pursu-ant to a loan agreement entered into in the ordinary course of its trade or business.
1370 Imposition of gross-basis tax and reporting by U.S. withholding agents The 30-percent tax on FDAP income is gen-erally collected by means of withholding.
1371 Withholding on FDAP payments to foreign payees is required unless the withholding agent,
1372i.e., the person making the pay-ment to the foreign person receiving the in-come, can establish that the beneficial owner of the amount is eligible for an exemp-tion from withholding or a reduced rate of withholding under an income tax treaty.
1373 The principal statutory exemptions from the 30-percent tax apply to interest on bank de-posits, and portfolio interest, described above.
1374 In many instances, the income subject to withholding is the only income of the foreign recipient that is subject to any U.S. tax. No U.S. Federal income tax return from the for-eign recipient is generally required with re-spect to the income from which tax was withheld, if the recipient has no ECI income and the withholding is sufficient to satisfy the recipient’s liability. Accordingly, al-though the 30-percent gross-basis tax is a withholding tax, it is also generally the final tax liability of the foreign recipient (unless the foreign recipients files for a refund). A withholding agent that makes payments of U.S.-source amounts to a foreign person is required to report and pay over any amounts of U.S. tax withheld. The reports are due to be filed with the IRS by March 15 of the cal-endar year following the year in which the payment is made. Two types of reports are required: (1) a summary of the total U.S.- source income paid and withholding tax withheld on foreign persons for the year and (2) a report to both the IRS and the foreign person of that person’s U.S.-source income that is subject to reporting.1375The non- resident withholding rules apply broadly to any financial institution or other payor, in-cluding foreign financial institutions.
1376 To the extent that the withholding agent deducts and withholds an amount, the with-held tax is credited to the recipient of the in-come.
1377If the agent withholds more than is required, and results in an overpayment of tax, the excess may be refunded to the re-cipient of the income upon filing of a timely claim for refund. Excise tax on foreign reinsurance premiums An excise tax applies to premiums paid to foreign insurers and reinsurers covering U.S. risks.
1378The excise tax is imposed on a gross basis at the rate of one percent on reinsur-ance and life insurance premiums, and at the rate of four percent on property and casualty insurance premiums. The excise tax does not apply to premiums that are effectively con-nected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business or that are exempted from the ex-cise tax under an applicable income tax trea-ty. The excise tax paid by one party cannot be credited if, for example, the risk is rein-sured with a second party in a transaction that is also subject to the excise tax. Many U.S. tax treaties provide an exemp-tion from the excise tax, including the trea-ties with Germany, Japan, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.
1379To prevent persons from inappropriately obtaining the benefits of exemption from the excise tax, the trea-ties generally include an anti-conduit rule. The most common anti-conduit rule provides that the treaty exemption applies to the ex-cise tax only to the extent that the risks covered by the premiums are not reinsured with a person not entitled to the benefits of the treaty (or any other treaty that provides exemption from the excise tax).
1380 2. Net-basis taxation of U.S.-source income The United States taxes on a net basis the income of foreign persons that is ‘‘effectively connected’’ with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States.1381Any gross income derived by the foreign person that is not effectively connected with the person’s U.S. business is not taken into account in determining the rates of U.S. tax applicable to the person’s income from the business.
1382 U.S. trade or business A foreign person is subject to U.S. tax on a net basis if the person is engaged in a U.S. trade or business. Partners in a partnership and beneficiaries of an estate or trust are treated as engaged in the conduct of a trade or business within the United States if the partnership, estate, or trust is so engaged.
1383 The question whether a foreign person is engaged in a U.S. trade or business is factual and has generated much case law. Basic issues include whether the activity con-stitutes business rather than investing, whether sufficient activities in connection with the business are conducted in the United States, and whether the relationship between the foreign person and persons per-forming functions in the United States in re-spect of the business is sufficient to at-tribute those functions to the foreign person. The trade or business rules differ from one activity to another. The term ‘‘trade or busi-ness within the United States’’ expressly in-cludes the performance of personal services within the United States.
1384If, however, a nonresident alien individual performs per-sonal services for a foreign employer, and the individual’s total compensation for the services and period in the United States are minimal ($3,000 or less in total compensation and 90 days or fewer of physical presence in a year), the individual is not considered to be engaged in a U.S. trade or business.
1385De- tailed rules govern whether trading in stocks or securities or commodities constitutes the conduct of a U.S. trade or business.
1386A for- eign person who trades in stock or securities or commodities in the United States through an independent agent generally is not treat-ed as engaged in a U.S. trade or business if the foreign person does not have an office or other fixed place of business in the United States through which trades are carried out. A foreign person who trades stock or securi-ties or commodities for the person’s own ac-count also generally is not considered to be engaged in a U.S. business so long as the for-eign person is not a dealer in stock or securi-ties or commodities. For eligible foreign persons, U.S. bilateral income tax treaties restrict the application of net-basis U.S. taxation. Under each trea-ty, the United States is permitted to tax business profits only to the extent those profits are attributable to a U.S. permanent establishment of the foreign person. The threshold level of activities that constitute a permanent establishment is generally higher than the threshold level of activities that constitute a U.S. trade or business. For ex-ample, a permanent establishment typically requires the maintenance of a fixed place of business over a significant period of time.

1407See sec. 884(d)(2) (excluding, for example, earn-ings and profits attributable to gain from the sale of Continued United States is subject to U.S. net-basis taxation on the income that is ‘‘effectively connected’’ with the business. Specific statu-tory rules govern whether income is ECI.
1387 In the case of U.S.-source capital gain and U.S.-source income of a type that would be subject to gross basis U.S. taxation, the fac-tors taken into account in determining whether the income is ECI include whether the income is derived from assets used in or held for use in the conduct of the U.S. trade or business and whether the activities of the trade or business were a material factor in the realization of the amount (the ‘‘asset use’’ and ‘‘business activities’’ tests).
1388 Under the asset use and business activities tests, due regard is given to whether the in-come, gain, or asset was accounted for through the U.S. trade or business. All other U.S.-source income is treated as ECI.
1389 A foreign person who is engaged in a U.S. trade or business may have limited cat-egories of foreign-source income that are considered to be ECI.
1390Foreign-source in-come not included in one of these categories (described next) generally is exempt from U.S. tax. A foreign person’s income from foreign sources generally is considered to be ECI only if the person has an office or other fixed place of business within the United States to which the income is attributable and the in-come is in one of the following categories: (1) rents or royalties for the use of patents, copyrights, secret processes or formulas, good will, trade-marks, trade brands, fran-chises, or other like intangible properties de-rived in the active conduct of the trade or business; (2) interest or dividends derived in the active conduct of a banking, financing, or similar business within the United States or received by a corporation the principal business of which is trading in stocks or se-curities for its own account; or (3) income derived from the sale or exchange (outside the United States), through the U.S. office or fixed place of business, of inventory or prop-erty held by the foreign person primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of the trade or business, unless the sale or ex-change is for use, consumption, or disposi-tion outside the United States and an office or other fixed place of business of the foreign person in a foreign country participated ma-terially in the sale or exchange.
1391Foreign- source dividends, interest, and royalties are not treated as ECI if the items are paid by a foreign corporation more than 50 percent (by vote) of which is owned directly, indirectly, or constructively by the recipient of the in-come.
1392 In determining whether a foreign person has a U.S. office or other fixed place of busi-ness, the office or other fixed place of busi-ness of an agent generally is disregarded. The place of business of an agent other than an independent agent acting in the ordinary course of business is not disregarded, how-ever, if the agent either has the authority (regularly exercised) to negotiate and con-clude contracts in the name of the foreign person or has a stock of merchandise from which he regularly fills orders on behalf of the foreign person.
1393If a foreign person has a U.S. office or fixed place of business, in-come, gain, deduction, or loss is not consid-ered attributable to the office unless the of-fice was a material factor in the production of the income, gain, deduction, or loss and the office regularly carries on activities of the type from which the income, gain, deduc-tion, or loss was derived.1394 Special rules apply in determining the ECI of an insurance company. The foreign-source income of a foreign corporation that is sub-ject to tax under the insurance company pro-visions of the Code is treated as ECI if the income is attributable to its United States business.
1395 Income, gain, deduction, or loss for a par-ticular year generally is not treated as ECI if the foreign person is not engaged in a U.S. trade or business in that year.
1396If, how- ever, income or gain taken into account for a taxable year is attributable to the sale or exchange of property, the performance of services, or any other transaction that oc-curred in a prior taxable year, the deter-mination whether the income or gain is tax-able on a net basis is made as if the income were taken into account in the earlier year and without regard to the requirement that the taxpayer be engaged in a trade or busi-ness within the United States during the later taxable year.
1397If any property ceases to be used or held for use in connection with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business and the property is disposed of within 10 years after the cessation, the determination whether any income or gain attributable to the disposition of the property is taxable on a net basis is made as if the disposition oc-curred immediately before the property ceased to be used or held for use in connec-tion with the conduct of a U.S. trade or busi-ness and without regard to the requirement that the taxpayer be engaged in a U.S. busi-ness during the taxable year for which the income or gain is taken into account.
1398 Transportation income from U.S. sources is treated as effectively connected with a foreign person’s conduct of a U.S. trade or business only if the foreign person has a fixed place of business in the United States that is involved in the earning of such in-come and substantially all of such income of the foreign person is attributable to regu-larly scheduled transportation.
1399 If the transportation income is effectively con-nected with conduct of a U.S. trade or busi-ness, the transportation income, along with transportation income that is from U.S. sources because the transportation both be-gins and ends in the United States, may be subject to net-basis taxation. Income from the international operation of a ship or air-craft may be eligible for an exemption under section 883, provided that the foreign juris-diction has extended reciprocity for U.S. businesses;
1400whether the party claiming an exemption is eligible for the tax relief;
1401 and the activities that give rise to the in-come qualify under relevant regulations. Allowance of deductions Taxable ECI is computed by taking into account deductions associated with gross ECI. For this purpose, the apportionment and allocation of deductions is addressed in detailed regulations. The regulations appli-cable to deductions other than interest ex-pense set forth general guidelines for allo-cating deductions among classes of income and apportioning deductions between ECI and non-ECI. In some circumstances, deduc-tions may be allocated on the basis of units sold, gross sales or receipts, costs of goods sold, profits contributed, expenses incurred, assets used, salaries paid, space used, time spent, or gross income received. More spe-cific guidelines are provided for the alloca-tion and apportionment of research and ex-perimental expenditures, legal and account-ing fees, income taxes, losses on dispositions of property, and net operating losses. De-tailed regulations under section 861 address the allocation and apportionment of interest deductions. In general, interest is allocated and apportioned based on assets rather than income. 3. Special rules FIRPTA A foreign person’s gain or loss from the disposition of a U.S. real property interest (‘‘USRPI’’) is treated as ECI and, therefore, as taxable at the income tax rates applicable to U.S. persons, including the rates for net capital gain. A foreign person subject to tax on this income is required to file a U.S. tax return under the normal rules relating to re-ceipt of ECI.1402In the case of a foreign cor-poration, the gain from the disposition of a USRPI may also be subject to the branch profits tax at a 30-percent rate (or lower treaty rate). The payor of income that FIRPTA treats as ECI (‘‘FIRPTA income’’) is generally re-quired to withhold U.S. tax from the pay-ment.
1403The foreign person can request a re-fund with its U.S. tax return, if appropriate, based on that person’s total ECI and deduc-tions (if any) for the taxable year. Branch profits taxes A domestic corporation owned by foreign persons is subject to U.S. income tax on its net income. The earnings of the domestic corporation are subject to a second tax, this time at the shareholder level, when divi-dends are paid. As described previously, when the shareholders are foreign, the sec-ond-level tax is imposed at a flat rate and collected by withholding. Unless the port-folio interest exemption or another exemp-tion applies, interest payments made by a domestic corporation to foreign creditors are likewise subject to U.S. tax. To approximate these second-level withholding taxes im-posed on payments made by domestic sub-sidiaries to their foreign parent corpora-tions, the United States taxes a foreign cor-poration that is engaged in a U.S. trade or business through a U.S. branch on amounts of U.S. earnings and profits that are shifted out of, or amounts of interest that are de-ducted by, the U.S. branch of the foreign cor-poration. These branch taxes may be reduced or eliminated under an applicable income tax treaty.
1404 Under the branch profits tax, the United States imposes a tax of 30 percent on a for-eign corporation’s ‘‘dividend equivalent amount.’’
1405 The dividend equivalent amount generally is the earnings and profits of a U.S. branch of a foreign corporation at-tributable to its ECI.
1406Limited categories of earnings and profits attributable to a for-eign corporation’s ECI are excluded in calcu-lating the dividend equivalent amount.

1430Sec. 954(b)(4). In arriving at the dividend equivalent amount, a branch’s effectively connected earnings and profits are adjusted to reflect changes in a branch’s U.S. net equity (that is, the excess of the branch’s assets over its liabilities, taking into account only amounts treated as connected with its U.S. trade or business).
1408The first adjustment reduces the dividend equivalent amount to the ex-tent the branch’s earnings are reinvested in trade or business assets in the United States (or reduce U.S. trade or business liabilities). The second adjustment increases the divi-dend equivalent amount to the extent prior reinvested earnings are considered remitted to the home office of the foreign corporation. Interest paid by a U.S. trade or business of a foreign corporation generally is treated as if paid by a domestic corporation and there-fore is subject to U.S. 30-percent withholding tax (if the interest is paid to a foreign person and a Code or treaty exemption or reduction would not be available if the interest were actually paid by a domestic corporation).
1409 Certain ‘‘excess interest’’ of a U.S. trade or business of a foreign corporation is treated as if paid by a U.S. corporation to a foreign parent and, therefore, is subject to U.S. 30- percent withholding tax.
1410For this purpose, excess interest is the excess of the interest expense of the foreign corporation appor-tioned to the U.S. trade or business over the amount of interest paid by the trade or busi-ness. Earnings stripping Taxpayers are limited in their ability to reduce the U.S. tax on the income derived from their U.S. operations through certain earnings stripping transactions that involve interest payments. If the payor’s debt-to-eq-uity ratio exceeds 1.5 to 1 (a debt-to-equity ratio of 1.5 to 1 or less is considered a ‘‘safe harbor’’), a deduction for disqualified inter-est paid or accrued by the payor in a taxable year is generally disallowed to the extent of the payor’s excess interest expense.
1411Dis- qualified interest includes interest paid or accrued to related parties when no Federal income tax is imposed with respect to such interest;
1412to unrelated parties in certain instances in which a related party guaran-tees the debt (‘‘guaranteed debt’’); or to a REIT by a taxable REIT subsidiary of that REIT. Excess interest expense is the amount by which the payor’s net interest expense (that is, the excess of interest paid or ac-crued over interest income) exceeds 50 per-cent of its adjusted taxable income (gen-erally taxable income computed without re-gard to deductions for net interest expense, net operating losses, domestic production ac-tivities under section 199, depreciation, am-ortization, and depletion). Interest amounts disallowed under these rules can be carried forward indefinitely and are allowed as a de-duction to the extent of excess limitation in a subsequent tax year. In addition, any ex-cess limitation (that is, the excess, if any, of 50 percent of the adjusted taxable income of the payor over the payor’s net interest ex-pense) can be carried forward three years. D. U.S. Tax Rules Applicable to Foreign Activities of U.S. Persons (Outbound) 1. In general In general, income earned directly by a U.S. person from the conduct of a foreign business is taxed on a current basis,1413but income earned indirectly from a separate legal entity operating the foreign business is not. Instead, active foreign business income earned by a U.S. person indirectly through an interest in a foreign corporation gen-erally is not subject to U.S. tax until the in-come is distributed as a dividend to the U.S. person. Certain anti-deferral regimes may cause the U.S. owner to be taxed on a cur-rent basis in the United States on certain categories of passive or highly mobile in-come earned by the foreign corporation re-gardless of whether the income has been dis-tributed as a dividend to the U.S. owner. The main anti-deferral regimes that provide such exceptions are the controlled foreign cor-poration (‘‘CFC’’) rules of subpart F
1414and the passive foreign investment company (‘‘PFIC’’) rules.
1415A foreign tax credit gen-erally is available to offset, in whole or in part, the U.S. tax owed on foreign-source in-come, whether the income is earned directly by the domestic corporation, repatriated as an actual dividend, or included in the domes-tic parent corporation’s income under one of the anti-deferral regimes.
1416 2. Anti-deferral regimes Subpart F Subpart F,
1417applicable to CFCs and their shareholders, is the main anti-deferral re-gime of relevance to a U.S.-based multi-national corporate group. A CFC generally is defined as any foreign corporation if U.S. persons own (directly, indirectly, or con-structively) more than 50 percent of the cor-poration’s stock (measured by vote or value), taking into account only those U.S. persons that are within the meaning of the term ‘‘United States shareholder,’’ which refers only to those U.S. persons who own at least 10 percent of the stock (measured by vote only).
1418 Subpart F income Under the subpart F rules, the United States generally taxes the 10-percent U.S. shareholders of a CFC on their pro rata shares of certain income of the CFC (referred to as ‘‘subpart F income’’), without regard to whether the income is distributed to the shareholders.
1419In effect, the United States treats the 10-percent U.S. shareholders of a CFC as having received a current distribu-tion of the corporation’s subpart F income. With exceptions described below, subpart F income generally includes passive income and other income that is readily movable from one taxing jurisdiction to another. Sub-part F income consists of foreign base com-pany income,
1420insurance income,1421and certain income relating to international boycotts and other violations of public pol-icy.
1422 Foreign base company income consists of foreign personal holding company income, which includes passive income such as divi-dends, interest, rents, and royalties, and a number of categories of income from busi-ness operations, including foreign base com-pany sales income, foreign base company services income, and foreign base company oil-related income.1423 Insurance income subject to current inclu-sion under the subpart F rules includes any income of a CFC attributable to the issuing or reinsuring of any insurance or annuity contract in connection with risks located in a country other than the CFC’s country of organization. Subpart F insurance income also includes income attributable to an in-surance contract in connection with risks lo-cated within the CFC’s country of organiza-tion as the result of an arrangement under which another corporation receives a sub-stantially equal amount of consideration for insurance of other country risks. Finally, special rules apply under subpart F with re-spect to related person insurance income
1424 in order to address captive insurance compa-nies.
1425Under these rules, the threshold for determining control is reduced to 25 percent, and any level of stock ownership by a U.S. person in such corporation is sufficient for the person to be treated as a U.S. share-holder. Investments in U.S. property The 10-percent U.S. shareholders of a CFC also are required to include currently in in-come for U.S. tax purposes their pro rata shares of the corporation’s untaxed earnings invested in certain items of U.S. property.
1426 This U.S. property generally includes tan-gible property located in the United States, stock of a U.S. corporation, an obligation of a U.S. person, and certain intangible assets, such as patents and copyrights, acquired or developed by the CFC for use in the United States.
1427There are specific exceptions to the general definition of U.S. property, in-cluding for bank deposits, certain export property, and certain trade or business obli-gations.
1428The inclusion rule for investment of earnings in U.S. property is intended to prevent taxpayers from avoiding U.S. tax on dividend repatriations by repatriating CFC earnings through non-dividend payments, such as loans to U.S. persons. Subpart F exceptions Several exceptions to the broad definition of subpart F income permit continued defer-ral for income from certain transactions, dividends, interest and certain rents and roy-alties received by a CFC from a related cor-poration organized and operating in the same foreign country in which the CFC is or-ganized.
1429The same-country exception is not available to the extent that the pay-ments reduce the subpart F income of the payor. A second exception from foreign base company income and insurance income is available for any item of income received by a CFC if the taxpayer establishes that the in-come was subject to an effective foreign in-come tax rate greater than 90 percent of the maximum U.S. corporate income tax rate (that is, more than 90 percent of 35 percent, or 31.5 percent).

1432See section 144 of the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 (Division Q of Pub. L. No. 114–113), H.R. 2029 [‘‘the PATH Act of 2015’’], which extended section 954(c)(6) for five years. Congress has previously extended the application of section 954(c)(6) several times, most recently in the Tax In-crease Prevention Act of 2014, Pub. L. No. 113–295; Pub. L. No. 107–147, sec. 614, 2002; Pub. L. No. 106–170, sec. 503, 1999; Pub. L. No. 105–277, 1998.

IRS approval is to be based on whether the method, the interest rate, the mor-tality and morbidity assumptions, and any other factors taken into account in determining foreign statement reserves (taken together or separately) provide an appropriate means of measuring income for Federal income tax purposes.

1449Secs. 531–537. 
1450Secs. 901, 902, 960, 1291(g). A provision colloquially referred to as the ‘‘CFC look-through’’ rule excludes from for-eign personal holding company income divi-dends, interest, rents, and royalties received or accrued by one CFC from a related CFC (with relation based on control) to the ex-tent attributable or properly allocable to non-subpart-F income of the payor.
1431The look-through rule applies to taxable years of foreign corporations beginning before Janu-ary 1, 2020, and to taxable years of U.S. shareholders with or within which such tax-able years of foreign corporations end.
1432 There is also an exclusion from subpart F income for certain income of a CFC that is derived in the active conduct of banking or financing business (‘‘active financing in-come’’), which applies to all taxable years of the foreign corporation beginning after De-cember 31, 2014, and for taxable years of the shareholders that end during or within such taxable years of the corporation.
1433With re- spect to income derived in the active con-duct of a banking, financing, or similar busi-ness, a CFC is required to be predominantly engaged in such business and to conduct sub-stantial activity with respect to such busi-ness in order to qualify for the active financ-ing exceptions. In addition, certain nexus re-quirements apply, which provide that income derived by a CFC or a qualified business unit (‘‘QBU’’) of a CFC from transactions with customers is eligible for the exceptions if, among other things, substantially all of the activities in connection with such trans-actions are conducted directly by the CFC or QBU in its home country, and such income is treated as earned by the CFC or QBU in its home country for purposes of such country’s tax laws. Moreover, the exceptions apply to income derived from certain cross border transactions, provided that certain require-ments are met. In the case of a securities dealer, an excep-tion from foreign personal holding company income applies to any interest or dividend (or certain equivalent amounts) from any transaction, including a hedging transaction or a transaction consisting of a deposit of collateral or margin, entered into in the or-dinary course of the dealer’s trade or busi-ness as a dealer in securities within the meaning of section 475.
1434In the case of a QBU of the dealer, the income is required to be attributable to activities of the QBU in the country of incorporation, or to a QBU in the country in which the QBU both main-tains its principal office and conducts sub-stantial business activity. A coordination rule provides that, for securities dealers, this exception generally takes precedence over the exception for active financing income. Income is treated as active financing in-come only if, among other requirements, it is derived by a CFC or by a QBU of that CFC. Certain activities conducted by persons re-lated to the CFC or its QBU are treated as conducted directly by the CFC or QBU.
1435 An activity qualifies under this rule if the activity is performed by employees of the re-lated person and if the related person is an eligible CFC, the home country of which is the same as the home country of the related CFC or QBU; the activity is performed in the home country of the related person; and the related person receives arm’s-length com-pensation that is treated as earned in the home country. Income from an activity qualifying under this rule is excluded from subpart F income so long as the other active financing requirements are satisfied. Certain income of a qualifying branch of a qualifying insurance company with respect to risks located within the home country of the branch or within the CFC’s country of creation or organization are also excepted from foreign personal holding company in-come, provided that certain requirements are met. Further, additional exceptions from insurance income and from foreign personal holding company income apply for certain income of certain CFCs or branches with re-spect to risks located in a country other than the United States, provided that the re-quirements for these exceptions, including reserve requirements, are met.1436 Exclusion of previously taxed earnings and profits A 10-percent U.S. shareholder of a CFC may exclude from its income actual distribu-tions of earnings and profits from the CFC that were previously included in the 10-per-cent U.S. shareholder’s income under sub-part F.
1437Any income inclusion (under sec-tion 956) resulting from investments in U.S. property may also be excluded from the 10- percent U.S. shareholder’s income when such earnings are ultimately distributed.
1438Or- dering rules provide that distributions from a CFC are treated as coming first out of earnings and profits of the CFC that have been previously taxed under subpart F, then out of other earnings and profits.
1439 Basis adjustments In general, a 10-percent U.S. shareholder of a CFC receives a basis increase with respect to its stock in the CFC equal to the amount of the CFC’s earnings that are included in the 10-percent U.S. shareholder’s income under subpart F.
1440Similarly, a 10-percent U.S. shareholder of a CFC generally reduces its basis in the CFC’s stock in an amount equal to any distributions that the 10-per-cent U.S. shareholder receives from the CFC that are excluded from its income as pre-viously taxed under subpart F.
1441 Passive foreign investment companies The Tax Reform Act of 1986
1442established the PFIC anti-deferral regime. A PFIC is generally defined as any foreign corporation if 75 percent or more of its gross income for the taxable year consists of passive income, or 50 percent or more of its assets consists of assets that produce, or are held for the pro-duction of, passive income.
1443Alternative sets of income inclusion rules apply to U.S. persons that are shareholders in a PFIC, re-gardless of their percentage ownership in the company. One set of rules applies to PFICs that are qualified electing funds, under which electing U.S. shareholders currently include in gross income their respective shares of the company’s earnings, with a sep-arate election to defer payment of tax, sub-ject to an interest charge, on income not currently received.1444A second set of rules applies to PFICs that are not qualified elect-ing funds, under which U.S. shareholders pay tax on certain income or gain realized through the company, plus an interest charge that is attributable to the value of deferral.
1445A third set of rules applies to PFIC stock that is marketable, under which electing U.S. shareholders currently take into account as income (or loss) the dif-ference between the fair market value of the stock as of the close of the taxable year and their adjusted basis in such stock (subject to certain limitations), often referred to as ‘‘marking to market.’’
1446 Under the PFIC regime, passive income is any income which is of a kind that would be foreign personal holding company income, including dividends, interest, royalties, rents, and certain gains on the sale or ex-change of property, commodities, or foreign currency. However, among other exceptions, passive income does not include any income derived in the active conduct of an insurance business by a corporation that is predomi-nantly engaged in an insurance business and that would be subject to tax under sub-chapter L if it were a domestic corpora-tion.
1447In applying the insurance exception, the IRS analyzes whether risks assumed under contracts issued by a foreign company organized as an insurer are truly insurance risks, whether the risks are limited under the terms of the contracts, and the status of the company as an insurance company.
1448 Other anti-deferral rules The subpart F and PFIC rules are not the only anti-deferral regimes. Other rules that impose current U.S. taxation on income earned through corporations include the ac-cumulated earnings tax rules
1449and the per- sonal holding company rules. Rules for coordination among the anti-de-ferral regimes are provided to prevent U.S. persons from being subject to U.S. tax on the same item of income under multiple regimes. For example, a corporation generally is not treated as a PFIC with respect to a par-ticular shareholder if the corporation is also a CFC and the shareholder is a 10-percent U.S. shareholder. Thus, subpart F is allowed to trump the PFIC rules. 3. Foreign tax credit Subject to certain limitations, U.S. citi-zens, resident individuals, and domestic cor-porations are allowed to claim credit for for-eign income taxes they pay. A domestic cor-poration that owns at least 10 percent of the voting stock of a foreign corporation is al-lowed a ‘‘deemed-paid’’ credit for foreign in-come taxes paid by the foreign corporation that the domestic corporation is deemed to have paid when the related income is distrib-uted as a dividend or is included in the do-mestic corporation’s income under the anti- deferral rules.
1450 The foreign tax credit generally is limited to a taxpayer’s U.S. tax liability on its for-eign-source taxable income (as determined under U.S. tax accounting principles). This limit is intended to ensure that the credit

1460Sec. 904(d). AJCA generally reduced the num-ber of income categories from nine to two, effective for tax years beginning in 2006. Before AJCA, the foreign tax credit limitation was applied separately to the following categories of income: (1) passive in-come, (2) high withholding tax interest, (3) financial services income, (4) shipping income, (5) certain dividends received from noncontrolled section 902 foreign corporations (also known as ‘‘10/50 compa-nies’’), (6) certain dividends from a domestic inter-national sales corporation or former domestic inter-national sales corporation, (7) taxable income at-tributable to certain foreign trade income, (8) cer-tain distributions from a foreign sales corporation or former foreign sales corporation, and (9) any other income not described in items (1) through (8) (so-called ‘‘general basket’’ income). A number of other provisions of the Code, including several en-acted in 2010 as part of Pub. L. No. 111–226, create ad-ditional separate categories in specific cir-cumstances or limit the availability of the foreign tax credit in other ways. See, e.g., secs. 865(h), 901(j), 904(d)(6), 904(h)(10).

1468See Treas. Reg. sec. 1.1503(d)–6(e)(1). 
1469Section 965(b)(4). The plan was required to pro-vide for the reinvestment of the repatriated divi-dends in the United States, including as a source for the funding of worker hiring and training, infra-structure, research and development, capital invest-ments, and the financial stabilization of the cor-poration for the purposes of job retention or cre-ation. 
1470Sec. 965(d)(1). 
1471Accordingly, taxpayers generally were ex-pected to pay regular dividends out of high-taxed CFC earnings (thereby generating deemed-paid cred-its available to offset foreign-source income) and section 965 dividends out of low-taxed CFC earnings (thereby availing themselves of the 85-percent de-duction). serves its purpose of mitigating double tax-ation of foreign-source income without off-setting U.S. tax on U.S.-source income.
1451 The limit is computed by multiplying a tax-payer’s total U.S. tax liability for the year by the ratio of the taxpayer’s foreign-source taxable income for the year to the taxpayer’s total taxable income for the year. If the total amount of foreign income taxes paid and deemed paid for the year exceeds the taxpayer’s foreign tax credit limitation for the year, the taxpayer may carry back the excess foreign taxes to the previous year or carry forward the excess taxes to one of the succeeding 10 years.
1452 The computation of the foreign tax credit limitation requires a taxpayer to determine the amount of its taxable income from for-eign sources in each limitation category (de-scribed below) by allocating and appor-tioning deductions between U.S.-source gross income, on the one hand, and foreign-source gross income in each limitation category, on the other. In general, deductions are allo-cated and apportioned to the gross income to which the deductions factually relate.
1453 However, subject to certain exceptions, de-ductions for interest expense and research and experimental expenses are apportioned based on taxpayer ratios.
1454In the case of interest expense, this ratio is the ratio of the corporation’s foreign or domestic (as appli-cable) assets to its worldwide assets. In the case of research and experimental expenses, the apportionment ratio is based on either sales or gross income. All members of an af-filiated group of corporations generally are treated as a single corporation for purposes of determining the apportionment ratios.
1455 The term ‘‘affiliated group’’ is determined generally by reference to the rules for deter-mining whether corporations are eligible to file consolidated returns.
1456These rules ex-clude foreign corporations from an affiliated group.
1457Interest expense allocation rules permitting a U.S. affiliated group to appor-tion the interest expense of the members of the U.S. affiliated group on a worldwide- group basis were modified in 2004, and ini-tially effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2008.
1458The effective date of the modified rules has been delayed to January 1, 2021.
1459A result of this rule is that interest expense of foreign members of a U.S. affiliated group is taken into account in determining whether a portion of the in-terest expense of the domestic members of the group must be allocated to foreign- source income. An allocation to foreign- source income generally is required only if, in broad terms, the domestic members of the group are more highly leveraged than is the entire worldwide group. The new rules are generally expected to reduce the amount of the U.S. group’s interest expense that is allo-cated to foreign-source income. The foreign tax credit limitation is applied separately to passive category income and to general category income.
1460Passive cat-egory income includes passive income, such as portfolio interest and dividend income, and certain specified types of income. All other income is in the general category. Pas-sive income is treated as general category income if it is earned by a qualifying finan-cial services entity. Passive income is also treated as general category income if it is highly taxed (that is, if the foreign tax rate is determined to exceed the highest rate of tax specified in Code section 1 or 11, as appli-cable). Dividends (and subpart F inclusions), interest, rents, and royalties received by a 10-percent U.S. shareholder from a CFC are assigned to a separate limitation category by reference to the category of income out of which the dividends or other payments were made.1461Dividends received by a 10-percent corporate shareholder of a foreign corpora-tion that is not a CFC are also categorized on a look-through basis.
1462 Special rules apply to the allocation of in-come and losses from foreign and U.S. sources within each category of income.
1463 Foreign losses from one category will first be used to offset income from foreign sources of other categories. If there remains an overall foreign loss, it will be deducted against in-come from U.S. sources. The same principle applies to losses from U.S. sources. In subse-quent years, the losses that were deducted against another category or source of income will be recaptured. That is, an equal amount of income from the same category or source that generated a loss in the prior year will be recharacterized as income from the other category or source against which the loss was deducted. Up to 50 percent of income from one source in any subsequent year will be recharacterized as income from the other source, whereas foreign-source income in a particular category can be fully recharacter-ized as income in another category until the losses from prior years are fully recap-tured.
1464 In addition to the foreign tax credit limita-tion just described, a taxpayer’s ability to claim a foreign tax credit may be further limited by a matching rule that prevents the separation of creditable foreign taxes from the associated foreign income. Under this rule, a foreign tax generally is not taken into account for U.S. tax purposes, and thus no foreign tax credit is available with re-spect to that foreign tax, until the taxable year in which the related income is taken into account for U.S. tax purposes.
1465 4. Special rules Dual consolidated loss rules Under the rules applicable to corporations filing consolidated returns, a dual consoli-dated loss (‘‘DCL’’) is any net operating loss of a domestic corporation if the corporation is subject to an income tax of a foreign coun-try without regard to whether such income is from sources in or outside of such foreign country, or if the corporation is subject to such a tax on a residence basis (a ‘‘dual resi-dent corporation’’).1466A DCL generally can-not be used to reduce the taxable income of any member of the corporation’s affiliated group. Losses of a separate unit of a domes-tic corporation (a foreign branch or an inter-est in a hybrid entity owned by the corpora-tion) are subject to this limitation in the same manner as if the unit were a wholly owned subsidiary of such corporation. An ex-emption is available under Treasury regula-tions in the case of DCLs for which a domes-tic use election (that is, an election to use the loss only for domestic, and not foreign, tax purposes) has been made.
1467Recapture is required, however, upon the occurrence of certain triggering events, including the con-version of a separate unit to a foreign cor-poration and the transfer of 50 percent or more of the assets of a separate unit within a twelve-month period.
1468 Temporary dividends-received deduction for repatriated foreign earnings AJCA section 421 added to the Code section 965, a temporary provision intended to en-courage U.S. multinational companies to re-patriate foreign earnings. Under section 965, for one taxable year certain dividends re-ceived by a U.S. corporation from its CFCs were eligible for an 85-percent dividends-re-ceived deduction. At the taxpayer’s election, this deduction was available for dividends re-ceived either during the taxpayer’s first tax-able year beginning on or after October 22, 2004, or during the taxpayer’s last taxable year beginning before such date. The temporary deduction was subject to a number of general limitations. First, it ap-plied only to cash repatriations generally in excess of the taxpayer’s average repatriation level calculated for a three-year base period preceding the year of the deduction. Second, the amount of dividends eligible for the de-duction was generally limited to the amount of earnings shown as permanently invested outside the United States on the taxpayer’s recent audited financial statements. Third, to qualify for the deduction, dividends were required to be invested in the United States according to a domestic reinvestment plan approved by the taxpayer’s senior manage-ment and board of directors.
1469 No foreign tax credit (or deduction) was al-lowed for foreign taxes attributable to the deductible portion of any dividend.
1470For this purpose, the taxpayer was permitted to specifically identify which dividends were treated as carrying the deduction and which dividends were not. In other words, the tax-payer was allowed to choose which of its dividends were treated as meeting the base- period repatriation level (and thus carry for-eign tax credits, to the extent otherwise al-lowable), and which of its dividends were treated as part of the excess eligible for the deduction (and thus subject to proportional disallowance of any associated foreign tax credits).
1471Deductions were disallowed for

1473Secs. 992(a) and (b). If a corporation fails to satisfy either or both of the 95-percent tests, it is deemed to satisfy such tests if it makes a pro rata distribution of its gross receipts which are not quali-fied export receipts and the fair market value of its assets which are not qualified export assets. Sec. 992(c). 
1474Sec. 991. Prior to the 1984 Revenue Act (Pub. L. 98–369), DISCs were eligible for more generous tax benefits that were eliminated in favor of the since- repealed foreign sales corporation regime (‘‘FSC’’). An overview of the history of the DISCs and FSCs regimes is provided in Joseph Isenbergh, Vol. 3 U.S. Taxation of Foreign Persons and Foreign Income, Para. 81. (Fourth Ed. 2016). 
1475The rate is the average of one-year constant maturity Treasury yields. The deferral benefit is the excess of the amount of tax for which the share-holder would be liable if deferred DISC income were included as ordinary income over the actual tax li-ability of such shareholder. Sec. 995(f). 
1476The amount of the deemed distribution is the sum of several items, including qualified export re-ceipts in excess of $10 million. See sec. 955(b). 
1477Sec. 995(c). 1478Under section 951(b), a domestic corporation is a United States shareholder of a foreign corporation if it owns, within the meaning of section 958(a), or is considered as owning by applying the rules of sec-tion 958(b), 10 percent or more of the voting stock of the foreign corporation. 
1479Consequently, for example, gain included in gross income as a dividend under section 1248(a) or 964(e) would constitute a dividend received for which the deduction under section 245A may be available. 
1480Pursuant to section 959(d), a distribution of previously taxed income does not constitute a divi-dend even if it reduces earnings and profits. 1481Called a ‘‘nimble dividend.’’ See, Boris I. Bittker and James S. Eustice, Federal Income Tax- ation of Corporations and Shareholders, (7th ed. 2016) para. 8–12. 
1482Under section 951(b), a domestic corporation is a United States shareholder of a foreign corporation if it owns, within the meaning of section 958(a), or is considered as owning by applying the rules of sec-tion 958(b), 10-percent or more of the voting stock of the foreign corporation. 
1483Secs. 1297, 1298. expenses that were directly allocable to the deductible portion of any dividend.
1472 Domestic international sales corporations A domestic international sales corpora-tions (‘‘DISC’’) is a domestic corporation that satisfies the following conditions: 95 percent of its gross receipts must be quali-fied export receipts; 95 percent of the sum of the adjusted bases of all its assets must be attributable to the sum of the adjusted bases of qualified export assets; the corporation must have no more than one class of stock; the par or stated value of the outstanding stock must be at least $2,500 on each day of the taxable year; and an election must be in effect to be taxed as a DISC.
1473In general, a DISC is not subject to corporate-level tax and offers limited deferral of tax liability to its shareholders.
1474 DISC income attrib-utable to a maximum of $10 million annually of qualified export receipts is generally ex-empt from income tax at both the corporate and shareholder level. Shareholders must pay interest to account for the benefit of de-ferring the tax liability on undistributed DISC income related to this $10 million max-imum annual amount.
1475Such entities are also referred to as interest charge DISCs, or IC–DISCs. Shareholders of a DISC are deemed to receive a dividend out of current earnings and profits from qualified export re-ceipts in excess of $10 million.
1476Gain on the sale of DISC stock is treated as a dividend to the extent of accumulated DISC income.
1477 The shareholders of a corporation which is not a DISC, but was a DISC in a previous taxable year, and which has previously taxed income or accumulated DISC income, are also required to pay interest on the deferral benefit, and gain on the sale or exchange of stock in such corporation is treated as a div-idend. INTERNATIONAL TAX PROVISIONS A. Establishment of Participation Exemption System for Taxation of Foreign Income 1. Deduction for foreign-source portion of dividends received by domestic corpora-tions from specified 10-percent owned foreign corporations (sec. 4001 of the House bill, sec. 14101 of the Senate amendment, and new sec. 245A of the Code) 
HOUSE BILL  In general The provision generally establishes a par-ticipation exemption system for foreign in-come. This exemption is provided for by means of a 100-percent deduction for the for-eign-source portion of dividends received from specified 10-percent owned foreign cor-porations by domestic corporations that are United States shareholders of those foreign corporations within the meaning of section 951(b) (referred to here as ‘‘participation DRD’’).1478 A specified 10-percent owned foreign cor-poration is any foreign corporation with re-spect to which any domestic corporation is a United States shareholder. The phrase does not include a passive foreign investment company within the meaning of subpart D of part VI of subchapter P. The term ‘‘dividend received’’ is intended to be interpreted broadly, consistently with the meaning of the phrases ‘‘amount re-ceived as dividends’’ and ‘‘dividends re-ceived’’ under sections 243 and 245, respec-tively.
1479Under proposed section 245A(e), the Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe such regulations or other guidance as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out the rules of section 245A, including clarifying the intended broad scope of the term ‘‘dividend received.’’ For example, if a domestic corporation in-directly owns stock of a foreign corporation through a foreign partnership and the do-mestic corporation would qualify for the par-ticipation DRD with respect to dividends from the foreign corporation if the domestic corporation owned such stock directly, the domestic corporation would be allowed a participation DRD with respect to its dis-tributive share of the partnership’s dividend from the foreign corporation. Foreign-source portion of a dividend The participation DRD is available only for the foreign-source portion of dividends received from specified 10-percent owned for-eign corporations. The foreign-source por-tion of any dividend is the amount that bears the same ratio to the dividend as the specified foreign corporation’s post-1986 un-distributed foreign earnings bears to the cor-poration’s total post-1986 undistributed earn-ings. Post-1986 undistributed earnings are the amount of the earnings and profits of a specified 10-percent owned foreign corpora-tion accumulated in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986, as of the close of the taxable year of the foreign corporation in which the dividend is distributed and not re-duced by dividends
1480distributed during that year. Post-1986 undistributed foreign earnings are, in general, the portion of post- 1986 undistributed earnings that is not at-tributable to post-1986 undistributed U.S. earnings. Post-1986 undistributed U.S. earn-ings are, in general, undistributed earnings attributable to: (a) the corporation’s income that is effectively connected with the con-duct of a trade or business within the United States, or (b) any dividend received (directly or through a wholly owned foreign corpora-tion) from an 80-percent-owned (by vote or value) domestic corporation. Rules similar to the rules described above apply when a dividend is paid out of earnings and profits of a specified 10-percent owned foreign corporation accumulated in taxable years beginning before January 1, 1987. As a consequence, the participation exemption system is available for both post-1986 and pre-1987 foreign earnings. An ordering rule provides that dividends are treated as first being paid out of post-1986 undistributed earnings to the extent of those earnings. An additional rule provides for the treat-ment of distributions of a specified 10-per-cent owned foreign corporation in excess of undistributed earnings. Under section 316(a)(2), a distribution of earnings and prof-its of a corporation in the taxable year of the distribution is treated as a dividend even if the distribution exceeds accumulated earn-ings and profits.1481The determination of the foreign-source portion of such a distribution is calculated in a similar manner as for other types of dividends. Foreign tax credit disallowance; foreign tax credit limitation No foreign tax credit or deduction is al-lowed for any taxes (including withholding taxes) paid or accrued with respect to a divi-dend that qualifies for the participation DRD. For purposes of computing the section 904(a) foreign tax credit limitation, a domes-tic corporation that is a United States share-holder of a specified 10-percent owned foreign corporation must compute its foreign-source taxable income (and entire taxable income) by disregarding the foreign-source portion of any dividend received from that foreign cor-poration for which the participation DRD is taken, as well as and any deductions prop-erly allocable or apportioned to that foreign- source portion or the stock with respect to which it is paid. Six-month holding period requirement A domestic corporation is not permitted a participation DRD in respect of any dividend on any share of stock that is held by the do-mestic corporation for 180 days or less during the 361-day period beginning on the date that is 180 days before the date on which the share becomes ex-dividend with respect to the divi-dend. For this purpose, a domestic corpora-tion is treated as holding a share of stock for any period only if the corporation is a speci-fied 10-percent owned foreign corporation and the taxpayer is a United States share-holder with respect to such corporation dur-ing that period. Effective date.—The provision applies to distributions made (and for purposes of de-termining a taxpayer’s foreign tax credit limitation under section 904, deductions in taxable years beginning) after December 31, 2017. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  In general The provision allows an exemption for cer-tain foreign income. This exemption is pro-vided for by means of a 100-percent deduction for the foreign-source portion of dividends received from specified 10-percent owned for-eign corporations by domestic corporations that are United States shareholders of those foreign corporations within the meaning of section 951(b)
1482 (referred to here as ‘‘DRD’’). A specified 10-percent owned foreign cor-poration is any foreign corporation (other than a PFIC that is not also a CFC) with re-spect to which any domestic corporation is a U.S. shareholder.
1483 Foreign-source portion of a dividend The DRD is available only for the foreign- source portion of dividends received by a do-mestic corporation from specified 10-percent

See Treas. Reg. sec. 1.952–2(b)(1). Therefore, a CFC receiving a dividend from a 10-percent owned foreign corpora-tion that constitutes subpart F income may be eligi-ble for the DRD with respect to such income. 
1487Under section 951(b) as revised by the Act, a do-mestic corporation is a United States shareholder of a foreign corporation if it owns, within the meaning of section 958(a), or is considered as owning by ap-plying the rules of section 958(b), 10-percent or more of the vote or value of the foreign corporation.

1490Pursuant to section 959(d), a distribution of previously taxed income does not constitute a divi-dend even if it reduces earnings and profits. owned foreign corporations. The foreign- source portion of any dividend is the amount that bears the same ratio to the dividend as the undistributed foreign earnings bears to the total undistributed earnings of the for-eign corporation. Undistributed earnings are the amount of the earnings and profits of a specified 10-percent owned foreign corpora-tion
1484as of the close of the taxable year of the specified 10-percent owned foreign cor-poration in which the dividend is distributed and not reduced by dividends
1485distributed during that taxable year. Undistributed for-eign earnings are the portion of the undis-tributed earnings attributable to neither in-come described in section 245(a)(5)(A) nor section 245(a)(5)(B), without regard to sec-tion 245(a)(12). Hybrid Dividends The DRD is not available for any dividend received by a U.S. shareholder from a con-trolled foreign corporation if the dividend is a hybrid dividend. A hybrid dividend is an amount received from a controlled foreign corporation for which a deduction would be allowed under this provision and for which the specified 10-percent owned foreign cor-poration received a deduction (or other tax benefit) from taxes imposed by a foreign country. If a controlled foreign corporation with re-spect to which a domestic corporation is a U.S. shareholder receives a hybrid dividend from any other controlled foreign corpora-tion with respect to which the domestic cor-poration is also a U.S. shareholder, then the hybrid dividend is treated for purposes of section 951(a)(1)(A) as subpart F income of the recipient controlled foreign corporation for the taxable year of the controlled foreign corporation in which the dividends was re-ceived and the U.S. shareholder includes in gross income an amount equal to the share-holder’s pro rata share of the subpart F in-come, determined in the same manner as section 951(a)(2). Foreign tax credit disallowance No foreign tax credit or deduction is al-lowed for any taxes paid or accrued with re-spect to a dividend that qualifies for the DRD. For purposes of computing the section 904(a) foreign tax credit limitation, a domes-tic corporation that is a U.S. shareholder of a specified 10-percent owned foreign corpora-tion must compute its foreign-source taxable income by disregarding the foreign-source portion of any dividend received from that foreign corporation for which the DRD is taken, and any deductions properly allocable or apportioned to that foreign-source portion or the stock with respect to which it is paid. Holding period requirement A domestic corporation is not permitted a DRD in respect of any dividend on any share of stock that is held by the domestic cor-poration for 365 days or less during the 731- day period beginning on the date that is 365 days before the date on which the share be-comes ex-dividend with respect to the divi-dend. For this purpose, the holding period re-quirement is treated as met only if the speci-fied 10-percent owned foreign corporation is a specified 10-percent owned foreign corpora-tion at all times during the period and the taxpayer is a U.S. shareholder with respect to such specified 10-percent owned foreign corporation at all times during the period. Effective date.—The provision is effective for taxable years of foreign corporations be-ginning after December 31, 2017, and for tax-able years of U.S. shareholders in which or with which such taxable years of foreign cor-porations end. CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  In general The provision in the conference agreement generally follows the provision in the Senate amendment, with some changes, as described below, and allows an exemption for certain foreign income by means of a 100-percent de-duction for the foreign-source portion of dividends received from specified 10-percent owned foreign corporations by domestic cor-porations
1486that are United States share-holders of those foreign corporations within the meaning of section 951(b)
1487(referred to here, as above, as ‘‘DRD’’). A specified 10-percent owned foreign cor-poration is any foreign corporation (other than a PFIC that is not also a CFC) with re-spect to which any domestic corporation is a U.S. shareholder.
1488 The term ‘‘dividend received’’ is intended to be interpreted broadly, consistently with the meaning of the phrases ‘‘amount re-ceived as dividends’’ and ‘‘dividends re-ceived’’ under sections 243 and 245, respec-tively. For example, if a domestic corpora-tion indirectly owns stock of a foreign cor-poration through a partnership and the do-mestic corporation would qualify for the par-ticipation DRD with respect to dividends from the foreign corporation if the domestic corporation owned such stock directly, the domestic corporation would be allowed a participation DRD with respect to its dis-tributive share of the partnership’s dividend from the foreign corporation. The DRD is available only to C corpora-tions that are not RICs or REITs. Foreign-source portion of a dividend The DRD is available only for the foreign- source portion of dividends received by a do-mestic corporation from specified 10-percent owned foreign corporations. The foreign- source portion of any dividend is the amount that bears the same ratio to the dividend as the undistributed foreign earnings bears to the total undistributed earnings of the for-eign corporation. Undistributed earnings are the amount of the earnings and profits of a specified 10-percent owned foreign corpora-tion
1489as of the close of the taxable year of the specified 10-percent owned foreign cor-poration in which the dividend is distributed and not reduced by dividends
1490distributed during that taxable year. Undistributed for-eign earnings are the portion of the undis-tributed earnings attributable to neither in-come described in section 245(a)(5)(A) nor section 245(a)(5)(B), without regard to sec-tion 245(a)(12). Hybrid dividends The DRD is not available for any dividend received by a U.S. shareholder from a con-trolled foreign corporation if the dividend is a hybrid dividend. A hybrid dividend is an amount received from a controlled foreign corporation for which a deduction would be allowed under this provision and for which the specified 10-percent owned foreign cor-poration received a deduction (or other tax benefit) with respect to any income, war profits, and excess profits taxes imposed by any foreign country. If a controlled foreign corporation with re-spect to which a domestic corporation is a U.S. shareholder receives a hybrid dividend from any other controlled foreign corpora-tion with respect to which the domestic cor-poration is also a U.S. shareholder, then the hybrid dividend is treated for purposes of section 951(a)(1)(A) as subpart F income of the recipient controlled foreign corporation (notwithstanding section 954(c)(6)) for the taxable year of the controlled foreign cor-poration in which the dividends was received and the U.S. shareholder includes in gross in-come an amount equal to the shareholder’s pro rata share of the subpart F income, de-termined in the same manner as section 951(a)(2). Foreign tax credit disallowance No foreign tax credit or deduction is al-lowed for any taxes paid or accrued with re-spect to any portion of a distribution treated as a dividend that qualifies for the DRD. For purposes of computing the section 904(a) foreign tax credit limitation, a domes-tic corporation that is a U.S. shareholder of a specified 10-percent owned foreign corpora-tion must compute its foreign-source taxable income (and entire taxable income) by dis-regarding the foreign-source portion of any dividend received from that foreign corpora-tion for which the DRD is taken, and any de-ductions properly allocable or apportioned to that foreign-source portion or the stock with respect to which it is paid. Holding period requirement A domestic corporation is not permitted a DRD in respect of any dividend on any share of stock that is held by the domestic cor-poration for 365 days or less during the 731- day period beginning on the date that is 365 days before the date on which the share be-comes ex-dividend with respect to the divi-dend. For this purpose, the holding period re-quirement is treated as met only if the speci-fied 10-percent owned foreign corporation is a specified 10-percent owned foreign corpora-tion at all times during the period and the taxpayer is a U.S. shareholder with respect to such specified 10-percent owned foreign corporation at all times during the period. Effective date.—The provision applies to distributions made (and for purposes of de-termining a taxpayer’s foreign tax credit limitation under section 904, deductions in taxable years beginning) after December 31, 2017. 2. Modification of subpart F inclusion for in-creased investments in United States property (sec. 4002 of the House bill, sec. 14218 of the Senate amendment, and sec. 956 of the Code) 
HOUSE BILL  Under the provision, the amount deter-mined under section 956 (relating to CFC in-vestments in United States property) with respect to a domestic corporation is zero. A similar rule is intended for domestic cor-porations that own a CFC through a domes-tic partnership. The provision includes a spe-cific grant of authority to the Secretary to issue regulations to effect that intent. Effective date.—The provision applies to taxable years of foreign corporations begin-ning after December 31, 2017.

CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement does not follow the House bill or the Senate amendment. 3. Special rules relating to sales or transfers involving specified 10-percent owned for-eign corporations (sec. 4003 of the House bill, sec. 14102 of the Senate Amendment and secs. 367(a)(3)(C), 961, 1248 and new sec. 91 of the Code) 
HOUSE BILL  Reduction in basis of certain foreign stock Solely for the purpose of determining a loss, a domestic corporate shareholder’s ad-justed basis in the stock of a specified 10-per-cent owned foreign corporation (as defined in new section 245A) is reduced by an amount equal to the portion of any dividend received with respect to such stock from such foreign corporation that was not taxed by reason of a dividends received deduction allowable under section 245A in any taxable year of such domestic corporation. This rule applies in coordination with section 1059, such that any reduction in basis required pursuant to this provision will be disregarded, to the ex-tent the basis in the 10-percent owned for-eign corporation’s stock has already been re-duced pursuant to section 1059. Inclusion of transferred loss amount in cer-tain assets transfers Under the provision, if a domestic corpora-tion transfers substantially all of the assets of a foreign branch (within the meaning of section 367(a)(3)(C)) to a foreign corporation which, after such transfer, is a specified 10- percent owned foreign corporation with re-spect to which the domestic corporation is a United States shareholder, the domestic cor-poration includes in gross income an amount equal to the transferred loss amount, subject to certain limitations. The transferred loss amount is the excess of: (1) losses incurred by the foreign branch after December 31, 2017 for which a deduction was allowed to the domestic corporation, over (2) the sum of taxable income earned by the foreign branch and gain recognized by reason of an overall foreign loss recapture arising out of disposition of assets on ac-count of the underlying transfer. For the purposes of (2), only taxable income of the foreign branch in taxable years after the loss is incurred through the close of the taxable year of the transfer is included. For transfers not covered by section 367(a)(3)(C), the transferred loss amount is reduced by the amount of gain recognized by the domestic corporation on the transfer (other than gains recognized by reason of overall foreign loss recapture). For transfers covered by section 367(a)(3)(C), the trans-ferred loss amount is reduced by the amount of gain recognized by reason of such subpara-graph. Amounts included in gross income by rea-son of the provision or by reason of section 367(a)(3)(C) are treated as derived from sources within the United States. The provision provides authority for the Secretary of the Treasury to prescribe regu-lations or other guidance for proper adjust-ments to the adjusted basis of the specified 10-percent owned foreign corporation to which the transfer is made, and to the ad-justed basis of the property transferred, to reflect amounts included in gross income under the provision. Effective date.—The provision relating to reduction of basis in certain foreign stock for the purposes of determining a loss is ef-fective for distributions made after Decem-ber 31, 2017. The provision relating to transfer of loss amounts from foreign branches to certain foreign corporations is effective for transfers after December 31, 2017. SENATE AMENDMENT  Sales by United States persons of stock In the case of the sale or exchange by a do-mestic corporation of stock in a foreign cor-poration held for one year or more, any amount received by the domestic corpora-tion which is treated as a dividend for pur-poses of section 1248, is treated as a dividend for purposes of applying the provision. Reduction in basis of certain foreign stock Solely for the purpose of determining a loss, a domestic corporate shareholder’s ad-justed basis in the stock of a specified 10-per-cent owned foreign corporation (as defined in this provision) is reduced by an amount equal to the portion of any dividend received with respect to such stock from such foreign corporation that was not taxed by reason of a dividends received deduction allowable under section 245A in any taxable year of such domestic corporation. This rule applies in coordination with section 1059, such that any reduction in basis required pursuant to this provision will be disregarded, to the ex-tent the basis in the specified 10-percent owned foreign corporation’s stock has al-ready been reduced pursuant to section 1059. Sale by a CFC of a lower-tier CFC If for any taxable year of a CFC beginning after December 31, 2017, an amount is treated as a dividend under section 964(e)(1) because of a sale or exchange by the CFC of stock in another foreign corporation held for a year or more, then: (i) the foreign-source portion of the dividend is treated as subpart F in-come of the selling CFC for purposes of sec-tion 951(a)(1)(A), (ii) a United States share-holder with respect to the selling CFC in-cludes in gross income for the taxable year of the shareholder with or within the taxable year of the CFC ends, an amount equal to the shareholder’s pro rata share (determined in the same manner as under section 951(a)(2)) of the amount treated as subpart F income under (i), and (iii) the deduction under sec-tion 245A(a) is allowable to the United States shareholder with respect to the subpart F in-come included in gross income under (ii) in the same manner as if the subpart F income were a dividend received by the shareholder from the selling CFC. In the case of a sale or exchange by a CFC of stock in another corporation in a taxable year of the selling CFC beginning after De-cember 31, 2017, to which this provision ap-plies if gain were recognized, rules similar to those in section 961(d) apply. Inclusion of transferred loss amount in cer-tain assets transfers Under the provision, if a domestic corpora-tion transfers substantially all of the assets of a foreign branch (within the meaning of section 367(a)(3)(C) as in effect before the date of enactment of TCJA) to a specified 10- percent owned foreign corporation with re-spect to which it is a U.S. shareholder after the transfer, the domestic corporation in-cludes in gross income an amount equal to the transferred loss amount, subject to cer-tain limitations. The transferred loss amount is the excess (if any) of: (1) losses incurred by the foreign branch after December 31, 2017, and before the transfer, for which a deduction was al-lowed to the domestic corporation, over (2) the sum of certain taxable income earned by the foreign branch and gain recognized by reason of an overall foreign loss recapture arising out of disposition of assets on ac-count of the underlying transfer. For the purposes of (2), only taxable income of the foreign branch in taxable years after the loss is incurred through the close of the taxable year of the transfer, is included. The trans-ferred loss amount is reduced by the amount of gain recognized by the taxpayer (other than gain recognized by reason of an overall foreign loss recapture) on account of the transfer. The amount of loss included in the gross income of the taxpayer under the proposed rule above for any taxable year cannot ex-ceed the amount allowed as a deduction under new section 245A for the taxable year (taking into account dividends received from all specified 10-percent owned foreign cor-porations with respect to which the taxpayer is a U.S. shareholder). Any amount not in-cluded in gross income for a taxable year be-cause of this proposed rule is included in gross income in the succeeding taxable year. Amounts included in gross income by rea-son of the provision are treated as derived from sources within the United States. Con-sistent with regulations or guidance that the Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe, proper adjustments are made in the adjusted basis of the taxpayer’s stock in the specified 10-percent owned foreign corporation to which the transfer is made, and in the trans-feree’s adjusted basis in the property trans-ferred, to reflect amounts included in gross income under this provision. Repeal of active trade or business exception Section 367 is amended to provide that in connection with any exchange described in section 332, 351, 354, 356, or 361, if a U.S. per-son transfers property used in the active conduct of a trade or business to a foreign corporation, such foreign corporation shall not, for purposes of determining the extent to which gain shall be recognized on such transfer, be considered to be a corporation. Effective date.—The provision relating to reduction of basis in certain foreign stock for the purposes of determining a loss is ef-fective for dividends received in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. The provisions relating to transfer of loss amounts from foreign branches to certain foreign corporations and to the repeal of the active trade or business exception are effec-tive for transfers after December 31, 2017. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The provision in the conference agreement retains elements of both the House Bill and the Senate amendment, as follows. Sales by United States persons of stock In the case of the sale or exchange by a do-mestic corporation of stock in a foreign cor-poration held for one year or more, any amount received by the domestic corpora-tion which is treated as a dividend for pur-poses of section 1248, is treated as a dividend for purposes of applying the provision. Reduction in basis of certain foreign stock Solely for the purpose of determining a loss, a domestic corporate shareholder’s ad-justed basis in the stock of a specified 10-per-cent owned foreign corporation (as defined in this provision) is reduced by an amount equal to the portion of any dividend received with respect to such stock from such foreign corporation that was not taxed by reason of a dividends received deduction allowable under section 245A in any taxable year of such domestic corporation. This rule applies in coordination with section 1059, such that any reduction in basis required pursuant to this provision will be disregarded, to the ex-tent the basis in the specified 10-percent owned foreign corporation’s stock has al-ready been reduced pursuant to section 1059.

1491Determined without regard to the rule pro-viding for proper adjustment of basis in the stock in the specified 10-percent owned foreign corporation to which the transfer is made. 1492Foreign corporations no longer in existence and for which there is no taxable year beginning or ending in 2017 are not within the scope of this provi-sion. 
1493Sec. 951(b), which defines United States share-holder as any U.S. person that owns 10 percent or more of the voting classes of stock of a foreign cor-poration. 
1494Taxation of income earned by PFICs remains subject to the antideferral PFIC regime and are in-eligible for the dividend received deduction under new section 245A. 1495For purposes of taking into account its subpart F income under this rule, a noncontrolled 10/50 cor-poration is treated as a CFC. 
1496Sec. 952(c)(1)(B)(ii). 
1497See Treas, Reg, 301.7701–3(c), under which an election may specify an effective date up to 75 days prior to the date on which the election is filed. as a dividend under section 964(e)(1) because of a sale or exchange by the CFC of stock in another foreign corporation held for a year or more, then: (i) the foreign-source portion of the dividend is treated as subpart F in-come of the selling CFC for purposes of sec-tion 951(a)(1)(A), (ii) a United States share-holder with respect to the selling CFC in-cludes in gross income for the taxable year of the shareholder with or within the taxable year of the CFC ends, an amount equal to the shareholder’s pro rata share (determined in the same manner as under section 951(a)(2)) of the amount treated as subpart F income under (i), and (iii) the deduction under sec-tion 245A(a) is allowable to the United States shareholder with respect to the subpart F in-come included in gross income under (ii) in the same manner as if the subpart F income were a dividend received by the shareholder from the selling CFC. In the case of a sale or exchange by a CFC of stock in another corporation in a taxable year of the selling CFC beginning after De-cember 31, 2017, to which this provision ap-plies if gain were recognized, rules similar to section 961(d) apply. Inclusion of transferred loss amount in cer-tain assets transfers Under the provision, if a domestic corpora-tion transfers substantially all of the assets of a foreign branch (within the meaning of section 367(a)(3)(C)) as in effect before the date of enactment of TCJA) to a specified 10- percent owned foreign corporation with re-spect to which it is a U.S. shareholder after the transfer, the domestic corporation in-cludes in gross income an amount equal to the transferred loss amount, subject to cer-tain limitations. The transferred loss amount is the excess (if any) of: (1) losses incurred by the foreign branch after December 31, 2017, and before the transfer, for which a deduction was al-lowed to the domestic corporation, over (2) the sum of certain taxable income earned by the foreign branch and gain recognized by reason of an overall foreign loss recapture arising out of disposition of assets on ac-count of the underlying transfer. For the purposes of (2), only taxable income of the foreign branch in taxable years after the loss is incurred through the close of the taxable year of the transfer, is included. The trans-ferred loss amount is reduced by the amount of gain recognized by the taxpayer (other than gain recognized by reason of an overall foreign loss recapture) on account of the transfer. Amounts included in gross income by rea-son of the provision are treated as derived from sources within the United States. Con-sistent with regulations or guidance that the Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe, proper adjustments are made in the adjusted basis of the taxpayer’s stock in the specified 10-percent owned foreign corporation to which the transfer is made, and in the trans-feree’s adjusted basis in the property trans-ferred, to reflect amounts included in gross income under this provision. The amount of gain taken into account under this provision is reduced by the amount of gain which would be recognized under section 367(a)(3)(C) as in effect before the date of enactment of TCJA
1491with re- spect to losses incurred before January 1, 2018. Repeal of active trade or business exception Section 367 is amended to provide that in connection with any exchange described in section 332, 351, 354, 356, or 361, if a U.S. per-son transfers property used in the active conduct of a trade or business to a foreign corporation, such foreign corporation shall not, for purposes of determining the extent to which gain shall be recognized on such transfer, be considered to be a corporation. Effective date.—The provisions relating to sales or exchanges of stock apply to sales or exchanges after December 31, 2017. The provision relating to reduction of basis in certain foreign stock for the purposes of determining a loss is effective for distribu-tions made after December 31, 2017. The provisions relating to transfer of loss amounts from foreign branches to certain foreign corporations and to the repeal of the active trade or business are effective for transfers after December 31, 2017. 4. Treatment of deferred foreign income upon transition to participation exemption sys-tem of taxation and deemed repatriation at two-tier rate (sec. 4004 of the House bill, sec. 14103 of the Senate amendment, and secs. 78, 904, 907 and 965 of the Code) HOUSE BILL  In general The provision generally requires that, for the last taxable year of a foreign corporation beginning before January 1, 2018, all U.S. shareholders of any CFC or other foreign cor-poration that is at least 10-percent U.S.- owned but not controlled (other than a PFIC) must include in income their pro rata shares of the accumulated post-1986 deferred foreign income that was not previously taxed. A portion of that pro rata share of de-ferred foreign income is deductible; the amount deductible varies depending upon whether the deferred foreign income is held in the form of liquid or illiquid assets. The deduction results in a reduced rate of tax of 14 percent for the included deferred foreign income held in liquid form and 7 percent for remaining deferred foreign income. A cor-responding portion of the credit for foreign taxes is disallowed, thus limiting the credit to the taxable portion of the included in-come. The increased tax liability generally may be paid over an eight-year period. Subpart F inclusion of deferred foreign in-come The mechanism for the mandatory inclu-sion of pre-effective date foreign earnings is subpart F. The provision provides that the subpart F income of all specified foreign cor-porations is increased for the last taxable year
1492that begins before January 1, 2018, by its accumulated post-1986 deferred foreign income. In contrast to the participation ex-emption deduction available only to domes-tic corporations that are U.S. shareholders under subpart F, the transition rule applies to all U.S. shareholders
1493of a specified for-eign corporation. A specified foreign cor-poration means (1) a CFC or (2) any foreign corporation in which a domestic corporation is a U.S. shareholder (determined without re-gard to the special attribution rules of sec-tion 958(b)(4)), other than a PFIC that is not a CFC.
1494A specified foreign corporation that has deferred foreign income is a de-ferred foreign income corporation. Con-sistent with the general operation of subpart F, each U.S. shareholder of a specified for-eign corporation must include in income its pro rata share of the foreign corporation’s subpart F income attributable to its accu-mulated deferred foreign income.1495 Accumulated post-1986 deferred foreign in-come Accumulated post-1986 deferred foreign in-come of a specified foreign corporation that is the subject of the mandatory inclusion under this provision is the greater of the ac-cumulated post-1986 deferred foreign income determined as of November 2, 2017 (the date of introduction of the bill) or as of December 31, 2017. The includible portion of the accu-mulated post-1986 deferred foreign income is all post-1986 earnings and profits that are (1) not attributable to income that is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States and thus sub-ject to current U.S. income tax, or (2) when distributed, not excludible from the gross in-come of a U.S. shareholder as previously taxed income under section 959. Post-1986 earnings and profits are those earnings that accumulated in taxable years beginning after 1986, computed in in accord-ance with sections 964(a) and 986, even if aris-ing from periods during which the U.S. shareholder did not own stock of the foreign corporation. Post-1986 earnings are not re-duced by distributions during the taxable year to which section 965 applies. Such earn-ings are increased by the amount of qualified deficits
1496that arose in a taxable year be-ginning before January 1, 2018, if such deficit is also treated as a qualified deficit for pur-poses of taxable years beginning after De-cember 31, 2017. Finally, the post-1986 earn-ings and profits are determined by reference to the foreign corporation’s total earnings and profits, irrespective of the foreign tax credit separate category limitations. The Secretary may prescribe appropriate rules regarding the treatment of accumu-lated post-1986 foreign deferred income of specified foreign corporations that have shareholders who are not U.S. shareholders. Such rules may also include rules that are appropriate to implement the intent of the revised section 965 and the use of the date of introduction as one of the measurement dates in order to establish a floor for deter-mining the post-1986 deferred foreign earn-ings and profits. For example, guidance may address the extent to which retroactive ef-fective dates selected in entity classification elections filed after introduction of the bill will be permitted.
1497 Reductions of amounts included in income of U.S. shareholder of foreign corporations with deficits in earnings and profits The income inclusion required of a U.S. shareholder under this transition rule is re-duced by the portion of aggregate foreign earnings and profits deficit allocated to that person by reason of that person’s interest in an ‘‘E&P deficit foreign corporation.’’ An E&P deficit foreign corporation is defined as any specified foreign corporation owned by the U.S. shareholder as of the date on which accumulated earnings and profits are meas-ure for that corporation (November 2, 2017 or December 31, 2017, as the case may be) and which also has a deficit in post-1986 earnings and profits as of that date. Accordingly, the deficits of a foreign subsidiary that accumu-lated prior to its acquisition by the U.S. shareholder may be taken into account in

1498For example, assume that a foreign corpora-tion organized after December 31, 1986 has $100 of ac-cumulated earnings and profits as of November 1, 2017, and December 31, 2017 (determined without diminution by reason of dividends distributed during the taxable year and after any increase for qualified deficits), which consist of $120 general limitation earnings and profits and a $20 passive limitation def-icit, the foreign corporation’s post-1986 earnings and profits would be $100, even if the $20 passive limita-tion deficit was a hovering deficit described in Treas. Reg. sec. 1.367(b)–17(d)(2). Foreign income taxes related to the hovering deficit, however, would not be deemed paid by the U.S. shareholder recog-nizing an incremental income inclusion. 
1499Sec. 964(b) and regulations thereunder. 1500Other foreign tax credits used by a taxpayer against tax liability resulting from the deemed in-clusion apply in full. 
1501Sec. 78. determining the aggregate foreign earnings and profits deficit of a U.S. shareholder.
1498 The U.S. shareholder aggregates its pro rata share in the foreign E&P deficits of each such company and allocates such aggregate amount among the deferred foreign income corporations in which the shareholder is a U.S. shareholder. The aggregate foreign E&P deficit is allocable to a specified foreign cor-poration in the same ratio as the U.S. share-holder’s pro rata share of post-1986 deferred income in that corporation bears to the U.S. shareholder’s pro rata share of accumulated post-1986 deferred foreign income from all de-ferred income companies of such share-holder. To illustrate the ratio, assume that Z, a domestic corporation, is a U.S. shareholder with respect to each of four specified foreign corporations, two of which are E&P deficit foreign corporations. Assume further the for-eign companies have the following accumu-lated post-1986 deferred foreign income or foreign earnings and profits deficits as of No-vember 2, 2017, and December 31, 2017: Example 
Specified Foreign Corp. Percentage Owned Post-1986 profit/deficit USD Pro Rata Share 
A ............................................... 60% ($1,000) ($600) B ............................................... 10% ($200) ($20) C ............................................... 70% $2,000 $1,400 D ............................................... 100% $1,000 $1,000 
The aggregate foreign earnings and profits deficit of the U. S. shareholder is ($620), and the aggregate share of accumulated post-1986 deferred foreign income is $2,400. Thus, the portion of the aggregate foreign earnings and profits deficit allocable to Corporation C is ($362), that is, ($620) × 1400/2400. The remain-der of the aggregate foreign earnings and profits deficit is allocable to Corporation D. The U.S. shareholder has a net surplus of earnings and profits in the amount of $1,780. The provision also permits intragroup net-ting among U.S. shareholders in an affiliated group in which there is at least one U.S. shareholder with a net E&P surplus and an-other with a net E&P deficit. The net E&P surplus shareholder may reduce its net sur-plus by the shareholder’s applicable share of aggregate unused E&P deficit, based on the group’s ownership percentage of the mem-bers. For example, a U.S. corporation may have two domestic subsidiaries, X and Y, in which it owns 100 percent and 80 percent, re-spectively. If X has a $1,000 net E&P surplus, and Y has $1,000 net E&P deficit, X is an E&P net surplus shareholder, and Y is an E&P net deficit shareholder. The net E&P surplus of X may be reduced by the net E&P deficit of Y to the extent of the group’s ownership per-centage in Y, which is 80-percent. The re-maining net E&P deficit of Y is unused. If the U.S. shareholder Z is also a wholly owned domestic subsidiary of the same U.S. parent as X and Y, the group ownership per-centage of Y is unchanged, and the surpluses of X and Z are reduced ratably by 800 of the net E&P deficit of Y. Participation exemption applied to accumu-lated post-1986 deferred foreign income A U.S. shareholder of a specified foreign corporation is allowed a deduction of a por-tion of the increased subpart F income at-tributable to the inclusion of pre-effective date deferred foreign income. The amount of the deduction is the sum of the 14-percent rate equivalent percentage of the inclusion amount that is the shareholder’s aggregate cash position and the 7-percent rate equiva-lent percentage of the portion of the inclu-sion that exceeds the aggregate cash posi-tion. By stating the permitted deduction in the form of a tax rate equivalent percentage, the provision ensures that all pre-effective date accumulated post-1986 deferred foreign income is subject to either a 7-percent or 14- percent rate of tax, depending on the under-lying assets as of the measurement date, without regard to the corporate tax rate that may be in effect at the time of the inclusion. For example, corporate taxpayers that use a fiscal year as the taxable year may report the increased subpart F income in a taxable year for which a reduced corporate tax rate would otherwise apply (on a pro-rated basis under section 15), but the allowable deduc-tion would be reduced such that the rate of U.S. tax on the income inclusion would be 7 or 14 percent. Aggregate cash position The aggregate cash position of a U.S. shareholder is the average of the sum of the shareholder’s pro rata share of the cash posi-tion of each specified foreign corporation with respect to which that shareholder is a U.S. shareholder on each of three dates: Date of introduction (November 2, 2017) and the last day of the two most recent taxable years ending before the date of introduction. Ap-propriate adjustments are made if a specified foreign corporation is not in existence on one or more of those dates. By using a three- year average as the aggregate cash position for a U.S. shareholders, the effect of unusual or anomalous transactions is muted. For purposes of this computation, the cash position of certain non-corporate entities that would be treated as specified foreign corporations if they were foreign corpora-tions is also included. The cash position of an entity consists of all cash, net accounts receivables, and the fair market value of similarly liquid assets, specifically including personal property that is actively traded on an established financial market, government securities, certificates of deposit, commer-cial paper, foreign currency, and short-term obligations. In addition, the Secretary may identify other assets that are economically equivalent to the enumerated assets that are included. Certain reductions from aggregate cash po-sition are specified in the provision. First, rules are provided to avoid the double count-ing of cash position of specified foreign cor-porations in an affiliated group, while ensur-ing that all of the cash position is taken into account. Second, regardless of the form in which a specified foreign corporation holds earnings, to the extent that the earnings constitute blocked income that could not be distributed by the corporation due to local jurisdiction restrictions,
1499such earnings are not included in the cash position of that specified foreign corporation. The blocked income remains within the scope of the accu-mulated post-1986 deferred foreign income that is subject to inclusion under this provi-sion. In addition to the authority to identify other assets that are subject to the cash po-sition determination by regulation, the pro-vision also authorizes the Secretary to dis-regard transactions that he determines had the principal purpose of reducing the aggre-gate foreign cash position. Foreign tax credits reduced A portion of foreign income taxes deemed paid or accrued with respect to the increased subpart F income attributable to the inclu-sion of pre-effective date deferred foreign in-come is not creditable against the Federal income tax attributable to the inclusion, nor is it deductible. The disallowed portion of foreign tax credits is 60-percent of foreign taxes paid attributable to the portion of the inclusion attributable to the aggregate cash position plus 80-percent of foreign taxes paid attributable to the remaining portion of the section 965 inclusion.1500 The provision coordinates the disallowance of foreign tax credits described above with the requirement
1501that a domestic cor-porate shareholder is deemed to receive a dividend in an amount equal to foreign taxes it is deemed to have paid and for which it claimed a credit. Under the coordination rule, the foreign taxes treated as paid or ac-crued by a domestic corporation as a result of the inclusion are limited to the those taxes in proportion to the taxable portion of the section 965 inclusion. The gross-up amount equals the total foreign income taxes multiplied by the fraction, numerator of which is taxable portion of the increased subpart F income under this provision and the denominator of which is the total in-crease in subpart F income under this provi-sion. The amount of deferred foreign income re-quired to be included in subpart F income under this provision is disregarded for pur-poses of determining the amount of income from foreign sources and the combined for-eign oil and gas income that a U.S. share-holder has for purposes of the recapture rules applicable to overall foreign losses, separate limitation losses, and foreign oil and gas losses under sections 904(f)(1) and 907(c)(4). The foreign income taxes deemed paid with respect to the inclusion required by the pro-vision and for which no credit is allowed in the year of inclusion by reason of section 904 limitations (e.g., because part or all of the inclusion required by the provision is offset by a net operating loss deduction) are eligi-ble for a special 20 year carry forward period, rather than the otherwise available 10 year period. Installment payments A U.S. shareholder may elect to pay the net tax liability resulting from the manda-tory inclusion of pre-effective-date undis-tributed CFC earnings in eight equal install-ments. The net tax liability that may be paid in installments is the excess of the U.S. shareholder’s net income tax for the taxable year in which the pre-effective-date undis-tributed CFC earnings are included in in-come over the taxpayer’s net income tax for that year determined without regard to the inclusion. Net income tax means net income tax as defined for purposes of the general business credit, but reduced by the amount of that credit. An election to pay tax in installments must be made by the due date for the tax re-turn for the taxable year in which the pre-ef-fective-date undistributed CFC earnings are included in income. The Treasury Secretary has authority to prescribe the manner of making the election. The first installment must be paid on the due date (determined without regard to extensions) for the tax re-turn for the taxable year of the income in-clusion. Succeeding installments must be

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH10112 December 15, 2017 
1502Section 1361 defines an S corporation as a do-mestic small business corporation that has an elec-tion in effect for status as an S corporation, with fewer than 100 shareholders, none of whom are non-resident aliens, and all of whom are individuals, es-tates, trusts or certain exempt organizations. 1503Sec. 951(b) defines United States shareholder as any U.S. person that owns 10 percent or more of combined voting classes of stock of a foreign cor-poration. 
1504For purposes of taking into account its subpart F income under this rule, a noncontrolled section 902 corporation is treated as a CFC. paid annually no later than the due dates (without extensions) for the income tax re-turn of each succeeding year. If a deficiency is later determined with respect to the net tax liability, the additional tax due may be prorated among all installment payments in most circumstances. The portions of the de-ficiency prorated to an installment that was due before the deficiency was assessed must be paid upon notice and demand. The portion prorated to any remaining installment is payable with the timely payment of that in-stallment payment, unless the deficiency is attributable to negligence, intentional dis-regard of rules or regulations, or fraud with intent to evade tax, in which case the entire deficiency is payable upon notice and de-mand. The timely payment of an installment does not incur interest. If a deficiency is deter-mined that is attributable to an understate-ment of the net tax liability due under this provision, the deficiency is payable with un-derpayment interest for the period beginning on the date on which the net tax liability would have been due, without regard to an election to pay in installments, and ending with the payment of the deficiency. Further-more, any amount of deficiency prorated to a remaining installment also bears interest on the deficiency, but not on the original in-stallment amount. The provision also includes an acceleration rule. If (1) there is a failure to pay timely any required installment, (2) there is a liq-uidation or sale of substantially all of the U.S. shareholder’s assets (including in a bankruptcy case), (3) the U.S. shareholder ceases business, or (4) another similar cir-cumstance arises, the unpaid portion of all remaining installments is due on the date of the event (or, in a title 11 case or similar proceeding, the day before the petition is filed). Special rule for S corporations A special rule permits deferral of the tran-sition net tax liability for shareholders of a U.S. shareholder that is a flow-through enti-ty known as an S corporation.
1502The S cor- poration is required to report on its income tax return the amount includible in gross in-come by reason of this provision, as well as the amount of deduction that would be al-lowable, and provide a copy of such informa-tion to its shareholders. Any shareholder of the S corporation may elect to defer his por-tion of the net tax liability at transition to the participation exemption system until the shareholder’s taxable year in which a trig-gering event occurs. The election to defer the tax is due not later than the due date for the return of the S corporation for its last taxable year that begins before January 1, 2018. Three types of events may trigger an end to deferral of the net tax liability. The first type of triggering event is a change in the status of the corporation as an S corpora-tion. The second category includes liquida-tion, sale of substantially all corporate as-sets, termination of the company or end of business, or similar event, including reorga-nization in bankruptcy. The third type of triggering event is a transfer of shares of stock in the S corporation by the electing taxpayer, whether by sale, death or other-wise, unless the transferee of the stock agrees with the Secretary to be liable for net tax liability in the same manner as the transferor. Partial transfers trigger the end of deferral only with respect to the portion of tax properly allocable to the portion of stock sold. If a shareholder of an S corporation has elected deferral under the special rule for S corporation shareholders and a triggering event occurs, the S corporation and the electing shareholder are jointly and sever-ally liable for any net tax liability and re-lated interest or penalties. The period within which the IRS may collect such liability does not begin before the date of an event that triggers the end of the deferral. If an election to defer payment of the net tax li-ability is in effect for a shareholder, that shareholder must report the amount of the deferred net tax liability on each income tax return due during the period that the elec-tion is in effect. Failure to include that in-formation with each income tax return will result in a penalty equal to five-percent of the amount that should have been reported. After a triggering event occurs, a share-holder is the S corporation may elect to pay the net tax liability in eight equal install-ments, subject to rules similar to those gen-erally applicable absent deferral. Whether a shareholder may elect to pay in installments depends upon the type of event that trig-gered the end of deferral. If the triggering event is a liquidation, sale of substantially all corporate assets, termination of the com-pany or end of business, or similar event, the installment payment election is not avail-able. Instead, the entire net tax liability is due upon notice and demand. The install-ment election is due with the timely return for the year in which the triggering event oc-curs. The first installment payment is re-quired by the due date of the same return, determined without regard to extensions of time to file. Effective Date.—The provision is effective for the last taxable year of a foreign corpora-tion that begins before January 1, 2018, and with respect to U.S. shareholders, for the taxable years in which or with which such taxable years of the foreign corporations end. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  In general The provision generally requires that, for the last taxable year beginning before Janu-ary 1, 2018, any U.S. shareholder of a speci-fied foreign corporation must include in in-come its pro rata share of the accumulated post-1986 deferred foreign income of the cor-poration. For purposes of this provision, a specified foreign corporation is any foreign corporation that has at least one U.S. share-holder. It excludes PFICs that are not also CFCs. A portion of that pro rata share of for-eign earnings is deductible; the amount of the deductible portion depends upon whether the deferred earnings are held in cash or other assets. The deduction results in a re-duced rate of tax with respect to income from the required inclusion of pre-effective date earnings. A corresponding portion of the credit for foreign taxes is disallowed, thus limiting the credit to the taxable por-tion of the included income. The separate foreign tax credit limitation rules of present law section 904 apply, with coordinating rules. The increased tax liability generally may be paid over an eight-year period. Spe-cial rules are provided for S corporations and real estate investment trusts (‘‘REITs’’). Subpart F The mechanism for requiring an inclusion of pre-effective-date foreign earnings is sub-part F. The provision provides that in the last taxable year of a deferred foreign in-come corporation that begins before January 1, 2018, which is that foreign corporation’s last taxable year before the transition to the new corporate tax regime elsewhere in the bill goes into effect, the subpart F income of the foreign corporation is increased by the greater of the accumulated post-1986 deferred foreign income of the corporation, deter-mined as of November 9, 2017, or as of Decem-ber 31, 2017 (‘‘measurement date’’). The amount so determined is includible in gross income under section 951 (hereinafter, ‘‘the section 951 inclusion’’). The transition rule applies to all U.S. shareholders1503of a deferred foreign income corporation. ‘‘Deferred foreign income cor-poration’’ is any specified foreign corpora-tion with accumulated post-1986 deferred in-come that is greater than zero. A specified foreign corporation is defined as any CFC as well as any section 902 corporation, as de-fined in section 909(d)(5) prior to date of en-actment of this bill, i.e., any foreign corpora-tion in which a U.S. person owns 10 percent of the voting stock. Consistent with the gen-eral operation of subpart F, each U.S. share-holder of a deferred foreign income corpora-tion must include in income the share-holder’s pro rata share of the foreign cor-poration’s subpart F income attributable to its section 951 inclusion.
1504 Accumulated post-1986 deferred foreign in-come A specified foreign corporation’s accumu-lated post-1986 deferred foreign income on the measurement date is based on all post- 1986 foreign earnings and profits (‘‘E&P’’) that are not previously taxed and are neither (1) attributable to income that is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States and subject to U.S. income tax nor (2) subpart F income (determined without regard to the section 951 inclusion) included in the gross income of a U.S. shareholder. The potential pool of in-cludible earnings includes all undistributed foreign earnings accumulated in taxable years beginning after 1986, computed in ac-cordance with sections 964(a) and 986, taking into account only periods when the foreign corporation was a specified corporation. The pool of post-1986 foreign earnings and profits is not reduced by distributions during the taxable year to which section 965 applies. Reductions of amounts included in income of U.S. shareholder of foreign corporations with deficits in E&P The pool of post-1986 earnings and profits taken into consideration in computing the section 951 inclusion required of a U.S. share-holder under this transition rule generally is reduced by foreign earnings and profits defi-cits that are properly allocated to that per-son. The U.S. shareholder must determine its aggregate E&P deficit based on its interest in each specified foreign corporation with a deficit in post-1986 foreign earnings and prof-its as of the measurement date (‘‘E&P deficit foreign corporation’’). The U.S. shareholder’s aggregate E&P def-icit is then allocated among the deferred for-eign income corporations in the same ratio as the U.S. shareholder’s pro rata share of post-1986 deferred income in that corporation bears to the U.S. shareholder’s pro rata share of accumulated post-1986 deferred foreign in-come from all deferred foreign income cor-porations with respect to which the share-holder is a U.S. shareholder. For the portion of aggregate E&P deficits that include quali-fied deficits, the portion of the deficit that is attributable to a qualified deficit, and the qualified activity, must be identified.

1505Committee Print, Reconciliation Recommenda-tions Pursuant to H. Con. Res. 71, S. Prt. 115–20, (De- cember 2017), as reprinted on the website of the Sen-ate Budget Committee, available at https:// www.budget.senate.gov/taxreform. , at footnote 1198, indicated that the income deducted was to be treat-ed as exempt from tax, with the result that the de-ducted income, if earned by a partnership, could give rise to an increase in a partner’s basis under section 705(a)(1)(B). 1506Other foreign tax credits used by a taxpayer against tax liability resulting from the deemed in-clusion apply in full. 
1507Sec. 78. 
1508Section 1361 defines an S corporation as a do-mestic small business corporation that has an elec-tion in effect for status as an S corporation, with no more than 100 shareholders, none of whom are non-resident aliens, and all of whom are individuals, es-tates, trusts or certain exempt organizations. 
1509To qualify as a REIT, an entity must meet cer-tain income requirements. A REIT is restricted to earning certain types of generally passive income. Among other requirements, at least 75 percent of the gross income of a REIT in each taxable year must consist of real estate-related income. Secs. 856. In addition, a REIT is required to distribute at least 90 percent of REIT income (other than net capital gain) annually. Sec. 857. Even if a REIT meets the 90-percent income distribution requirement for REIT qualification, more stringent distribution re-
quirements must be met in order to avoid an excise tax under section 4981. 
1510Liquidating distributions are covered to the ex-tent of earnings and profits, and are defined to in-clude redemptions of stock that are treated by shareholders as a sale of stock under section 302. Secs. 857(b)(2)(B), 561, and 562(b). provision does not permit intragroup netting among U.S. shareholders within an affiliated group. In taxable years beginning after 2017, amounts by which the section 951 inclusion was reduced by aggregate E&P deficits are considered as amounts included in the gross income of the U.S. shareholder. The share-holder’s pro rata share of the E&P of an E&P deficit foreign corporation that used quali-fied deficits to reduce its section 951 inclu-sion is increased by the amount of such def-icit and attributed to the same activity to which the income was attributed. Deductions from section 951 inclusion To determine the taxable portion of the section 951 inclusion, the U.S. shareholders with accumulated deferred foreign income may deduct a portion of the section 951 in-clusion in an amount that depends upon the proportion of aggregate earnings and profits attributable to cash assets rather than noncash assets, in the nature of a partial dividends-received deduction. A U.S. share-holder may deduct 71.4 percent of the aggre-gate earnings and profits attributable to cash assets, and 85.7 percent of the remain-der of the aggregate earnings and profits in the section 951 inclusion.
1505 A U.S. shareholder may elect, no later than with a timely filed return for the tax-able year, not to apply its net operating loss deduction to the deemed repatriation. If so, neither the section 951 inclusion nor any re-lated deemed paid foreign tax credits may be taken into account in computing the net op-erating loss deduction for that year. Cash position The aggregate earnings and profits attrib-utable to cash assets for a U.S. shareholder is the greater of the pro rata share of the cash position of all specified foreign corpora-tions as of the last day of the last taxable year beginning before January 1, 2018, or the average of the cash position determined on the last day of each of the two taxable years ending immediately before November 9, 2017. For purposes of this computation, the cash position of certain non-corporate entities that would be treated as specified foreign corporations if they were foreign corpora-tions is also included. The cash position of an entity consists of all cash, net accounts receivables, and the fair market value of similarly liquid assets, specifically including personal property that is actively traded on an established financial market (other than stock in the specified foreign corporation) government securities, certificates of de-posit, commercial paper, and short-term ob-ligations. To avoid double counting of cash assets, a U.S. shareholder may disregard accounts re-ceivable and short-term obligations of a specified foreign corporation if that share-holder can establish that the amounts were already taken into account by that share-holder with respect to another specified for-eign corporation. The Secretary may identify other assets that are economically equivalent to the enu-merated assets that are treated as cash. The provision also authorizes the Secretary to disregard transactions that are determined to have the principal purpose of reducing the aggregate foreign cash position. Foreign tax credit A portion of foreign income tax that is deemed paid or accrued with respect to the section 951 inclusion is not creditable or de-ductible against the Federal income tax at-tributable to the inclusion. The disallowed portion of foreign tax credits is 71.4 percent of foreign taxes paid attributable to the por-tion of the section 965 inclusion attributable to the aggregate cash position plus, 85.7 per-cent of foreign taxes paid attributable to the remaining portion of the section 965 inclu-sion.1506The provision coordinates the dis-allowance of foreign tax credits with the re-quirement
1507 that a domestic corporate shareholder is deemed to receive a dividend in an amount equal to foreign taxes it is deemed to have paid and for which it claimed a credit. Limitations on assessment extended The provision also allows an exception to the otherwise applicable limitations period for assessment of tax to ensure that the pe-riod for assessment of underpayments in tax related to the treatment of the pre-effective date foreign earnings does not expire prior to six years from the date on which the return initially reflecting the section 951 inclusion was filed. Installment payments The Senate amendment follows the House provision in allowing a U.S. shareholder to elect to pay the net tax liability resulting from the section 951 inclusion in eight in-stallments. However, if installment payment is elected, rather than requiring eight equal installments, the Senate amendment re-quires that the payments for each of the first five years equal 8 percent of the net tax li-ability, the sixth installment equals 15 per-cent of the net tax liability, increasing to 20 percent for the seventh installment and the remaining balance of 25 percent in the eighth year. Special rule for S corporations The Senate amendment also includes the special rule of the House provision that per-mits deferral of the transition net tax liabil-ity for shareholders of a U.S. shareholder that is a flow-through entity known as an S corporation.
1508After a triggering event oc-curs, a shareholder in the S corporation may elect to pay the net tax liability in eight in-stallments, subject to rules similar to those generally applicable absent deferral. Special rules for REITs To alleviate burden of compliance with this section by REITs, special rules are pro-vided if a U.S. shareholder is a REIT. First, although it must determine its pro rata share of the increase in subpart F income in accordance with the rules described above, the REIT is not required to take into ac-count the section 951 inclusion for purposes of determining the REIT’s amount of quali-fied REIT gross income.
1509The section 951 inclusion is, however, taken into account for purposes of determining the income poten-tially required to be included in taxable in-come under section 857(b). Unlike a regular subchapter C corporation, a REIT is able to deduct the portion of its income that is dis-tributed to its shareholders as a dividend or qualifying liquidating distribution each year.1510The distributed income of the REIT is not taxed at the entity level; instead, it is taxed once, at the investor level. As a result, a required inclusion under this section may trigger a requirement that the REIT dis-tribute an amount equal to 90 percent of that inclusion despite the fact that it received no distribution from the deferred foreign in-come corporation. To avoid requiring that any distribution requirement be satisfied in one year, an elec-tion to defer the section 951 inclusion is per-mitted. Under a timely election, a REIT may instead take the amounts into income over a period of eight years. It must include 8 per-cent in each of the five years beginning with the initial year in which the section 951 in-clusion is determined, 15 percent in the sixth year, 20 percent in the seventh year and 25 percent in the eighth year. In each of those years, it may claim a partial dividends-re-ceived deduction in the applicable percent-ages in proportion to the amount included in each of the eight years. Neither the REIT nor the recipient of the distribution may elect to use the installment payment. In the event that a REIT liquidates, ceases to operate its business, or distributes sub-stantially all its assets (or any other similar event occurs), any portion of the required in-clusion not yet taken into income is acceler-ated and required to be included as gross in-come as of the day before the event. Recapture from expatriated entities The provision denies any deduction claimed with respect to the mandatory sub-part F inclusion and imposes a 35-percent tax on the entire inclusion if a U.S. shareholder becomes an expatriated entity within the meaning of section 7874(a)(2) at any point within the ten-year period following enact-ment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. An enti-ty that becomes a surrogate foreign corpora-tion that is treated as a domestic corpora-tion under section 7874(b) is not within the scope of this recapture provision. Although the amount due is computed by reference to the year in which the deemed subpart F in-come was originally reported, the additional tax arises and is assessed for the taxable year in which the U.S. shareholder becomes an expatriated entity. No foreign tax credits are permitted with respect to the additional tax due as a result of the recapture rule. Regulatory authority A specific grant of regulatory authority to carry out the intent of this provision is in-cluded. For example, the Secretary may identify instances in which it is appropriate to grant relief from potential double-count-ing of earnings and profits, which may occur due to different measurement dates applica-ble to specified foreign corporations within an affiliated group, or the timing of intragroup distributions. It also specifies that the Secretary shall prescribe rules or guidance in order to deter tax avoidance through use of entity classification elections and accounting method changes, among other possible strategies. Effective date.—The provision is effective for the last taxable year of a foreign corpora-tion that begins before January 1, 2018, and

CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement generally fol-lows the Senate amendment, with several modifications, including those described below. Scope of earnings and profits subject to the transition tax The provision applies to all CFCs. It also applies to all foreign corporations (other than PFICs), in which a U.S. person owns a 10-percent voting interest, rather than only CFCs and those corporations within the defi-nition of section 902 corporation. However, in the case of a foreign corporation that is not a CFC, there must be at least one U.S. share-holder that is a domestic corporation in order for the foreign corporation to be a specified foreign corporation. Such entities must determine their deferred foreign in-come based on the greater of the aggregate post-1986 accumulated foreign earnings and profits as of November 2, 2017 or December 31, 2017, not reduced by distributions during the taxable year ending with or including the measurement date, unless such distribu-tions were made to another specified foreign corporation. The portion of post-1986 earn-ings and profits subject to the transition tax does not include earnings and profits that were accumulated by a foreign company prior to attaining its status as a specified foreign corporation. Deferred earnings of a U.S. shareholder are reduced (but not below zero) by the share-holder’s share of deficits as of November 2, 2017, from a specified foreign corporation that is not a deferred foreign income cor-porations, including the pro rata share of deficits of another U.S. shareholder in a dif-ferent U.S. ownership chain within the same U.S. affiliated group. The deficits (including hovering deficits
1511) of a foreign subsidiary that accumulated while it was a specified foreign corporation may be taken into ac-count in determining the aggregate foreign earnings and profits deficit of a U.S. share-holder. Therefore, the amount of post-1986 earnings and profits of a specified foreign corporation is the amount of positive earn-ings and profits accumulated as of the meas-urement date reduced by any deficit in earn-ings and profits of the specified foreign cor-poration as of the measurement date, with-out regard to the limitation category of the earnings or deficit. In taxable years begin-ning with the year of the section 951 inclu-sion, amounts by which the section 951 inclu-sion was reduced by aggregate E&P deficits are considered as amounts included in the gross income of the U.S. shareholder for pur-poses of applying section 959. For example, assume that a foreign cor-poration organized after December 31, 1986 has $100 of accumulated earnings and profits as of November 2, 2017, and December 31, 2017 (determined without diminution by reason of dividends distributed during the taxable year and after any increase for qualified deficits), which consist of $120 general limitation earn-ings and profits and a $20 passive limitation deficit, the foreign corporation’s post-1986 earnings and profits would be $100, even if the $20 passive limitation deficit was a hov-ering deficit. Foreign income taxes related to the hovering deficit, however, would not generally be deemed paid by the U.S. share-holder recognizing an incremental income inclusion. However, the conferees expect the Secretary may issue guidance to provide that, solely for purposes of calculating the amount of foreign income taxes deemed paid by the U.S. shareholder with respect to an inclusion under section 965, a hovering def-icit may be absorbed by current year earn-ings and profits and the foreign income taxes related to the hovering deficit may be added to the specified foreign corporation’s post- 1986 foreign income taxes in that separate category on a pro rata basis in the year of in-clusion.1512 In order to avoid double-counting and dou-ble non-counting of earnings, the Secretary may provide guidance to adjust the amount of post-1986 earnings and profits of a speci-fied foreign corporation to ensure that a sin-gle item of a specified foreign corporation is taken into account only once in determining the income of a United States shareholder subject to this provision. Such an adjust-ment may be necessary, for example, when there is a deductible payment (e.g., interest or royalties) from one specified foreign cor-poration to another specified foreign cor-poration between measurement dates. The conferees are also aware that certain taxpayers may have engaged in tax strate-gies designed to reduce the amount of post- 1986 earnings and profits in order to decrease the amount of the inclusion required under this provision. Such tax strategies may in-clude a change in entity classification, ac-counting method, and taxable year, or intragroup transactions such as distribu-tions or liquidations. The conferees expect the Secretary to prescribe rules to adjust the amount of post-1986 earnings and profits in such cases in order to prevent the avoidance of the purposes of this section. Furthermore, the conferees expect that the Secretary will exercise his authority under the consolidated return provisions to appro-priately limit the netting across chains of ownership within a group of related parties in the application of this provision. However, nothing in this provision is intended to be interpreted as limiting the Secretary’s au-thority to use such regulatory authority to prescribe regulations on proper application of this section on a consolidated basis for af-filiated groups filing a consolidated return. Application of participation exemption deduc-tion and related foreign tax credits Instead of prescribing a fixed percentage of the section 951 inclusion resulting from sec-tion 965 for which a partial dividends-re-ceived deduction is permitted, the con-ference agreement adopts the rate equiva-lent percentage method used in the House bill. As a result, the total deduction from the amount of the section 951 inclusion is the amount necessary to result in a 15.5-percent rate of tax on accumulated post-1986 foreign earnings held in the form of cash or cash equivalents, and 8-percent rate of tax on all other earnings. The calculation is based on the highest rate of tax applicable to corpora-tions in the taxable year of inclusion, even if the U.S. shareholder is an individual. The use of rate equivalent percentages is intended to ensure that the rates of tax im-posed on the deferred foreign income is simi-lar for all U.S. shareholders, regardless of the year in which section 965 gives rise to an income inclusion. Individual U.S. share-holders, and the investors in U.S. share-holders that are pass-through entities gen-erally can elect application of corporate rates for the year of inclusion.
1513In addi- tion, the increase in income that is not taxed by reason of the partial dividends-received deduction allowed under this provision is treated as income exempt from tax for pur-poses of determining the basis in an interest in a partnership or subchapter S corporation, but not as income exempt from tax for pur-poses of determining the accumulated ad-justments account of a subchapter S cor-poration.1514Similarly, the conferees expect the Secretary to provide regulations or other guidance that provide for similar treatment under section 986(c), such that any gain or loss recognized thereunder with respect to distributions of earnings previously taxed (or treated as previously taxed) by reason of sec-tion 965(a) will be diminished proportion-ately to the diminution of the net taxable in-come resulting from section 965(a) by reason of the deduction allowed under section 965(c). To reflect the change in the applicable rates of deduction, the amounts by which foreign tax credits are reduced are also changed. In addition, the rules for coordina-tion of this provision with the limitations on foreign tax credits follows the House provi-sion. Under the coordination rule, the for-eign taxes treated as paid or accrued by a do-mestic corporation as a result of the inclu-sion are limited to the those taxes in propor-tion to the taxable portion of the section 965 inclusion. The gross-up amount equals the total foreign income taxes multiplied by the fraction, numerator of which is taxable por-tion of the increased subpart F income under this provision and the denominator of which is the total increase in subpart F income under this provision. The conferees recognize that basis adjust-ments (increases or decreases) may be nec-essary with respect to both the stock of the deferred foreign income corporation and the E&P deficit foreign corporation and author-izes the Secretary to provide for such basis adjustments or other adjustments, as may be appropriate. For example, with respect to the stock of the deferred foreign income cor-poration, the Secretary may determine that a basis increase is appropriate in the taxable year of the section 951A inclusion or, alter-natively, the Secretary may modify the ap-plication of section 961(b)(1) with respect to such stock. Moreover, with respect to the stock of the E&P deficit corporation, the Secretary may require a reduction in basis for the taxable year in which the U.S. share-holder’s pro rata share of the earnings of the E&P deficit corporation are increased. With respect to the denial of the partial dividend to any U.S. shareholder that be-comes an expatriated entity within the meaning of section 7874(a)(2) at any point within the ten-year period following enact-ment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the con-ference agreement clarifies that U.S. share-holders acquired by a surrogate corporation are within the scope of the provision only if the surrogate corporation inverted post-en-actment. Determination of cash position The determination of assets to be consid-ered in measuring the cash position of an en-tity is modified in several ways. First, cash holdings of a specified foreign corporation in the form of publicly traded stock may be ex-cluded to the extent that a U.S. shareholder can demonstrate that the value of such stock was taken into account as cash or cash equivalent by another specified foreign cor-poration with respect to which such share-holder is a U.S. shareholder. The conference agreement also provides that the cash position of a U.S. shareholder does not generally include the cash attrib-utable to a direct ownership interest in a partnership, but preserves the rule that cash positions of certain noncorporate foreign en-tities owned by a specified foreign corpora-tion are taken into account if such entities

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H10115 December 15, 2017 
1515The deduction for FDII and GILTI is only available to domestic corporations. U.S. share-holders that are not domestic corporations are sub-ject to full U.S. tax on their GILTI. 
1516Under sec. 13001 of the Senate amendment, the corporate tax rate is reduced to 20 percent for tax-able years beginning after December 31, 2018. 
1517The Committee intends that the deduction al-lowed by new Code section 250 be treated as exempt-ing the deducted income from tax. Thus, for exam-ple, the deduction for global intangible low-taxed in-come could give rise to an increase in a domestic corporate partner’s basis in a domestic partnership under section 705(a)(1)(B). 
1518For example, consider a domestic corporation with $1,250 of FDII, $750 of GILTI, and taxable in-come (determined without regard to this provision) of $1,500. The sum of the corporation’s FDII and GILTI amounts is $2,000, which exceeds $1,500 by $500. For purposes of this provision, the amount of FDII for which a deduction is allowed is reduced by $500 multiplied by $1,250/$2,000, or $312.50. The amount of GILTI for which a deduction is allowed is reduced by the remainder of the excess, or $187.50 (= $500 × $750/$2,000). 
1519This formula assumes that the excess described in the preceding paragraph is positive. Otherwise there is no deduction eligible income. 
1520If the quantity in this formula is negative, deemed intangible income is zero. 
1521For example, if a building is used in the pro-duction of $1,000 of total gross income for a taxable Continued would be specified foreign corporations with respect to the U.S. shareholder if the entity were a foreign corporation. For example, if a U.S. shareholder owns a five-percent interest in a partnership, the balance of which is held by a specified foreign corporation with re-spect to which such shareholder is a U.S. shareholder, the partnership is treated as a specified foreign corporation with respect to the U.S. shareholder, and the cash or cash equivalents held by the partnership are in-cludible in the aggregate cash position of the U.S. shareholder on a look-through basis. The conferees anticipate that the Secretary will provide guidance for taking into ac-count only the specified foreign corpora-tion’s share of the partnership’s cash posi-tion, and not the five-percent interest di-rectly owned by the U.S. shareholder. Effective date.—The provision is effective for the last taxable year of a foreign corpora-tion that begins before January 1, 2018, and with respect to U.S. shareholders, for the taxable years in which or with which such taxable years of the foreign corporations end. 15. Election to increase percentage of domes-tic taxable income offset by overall do-mestic loss treated as foreign source (sec. 14305 of the Senate amendment and sec. 904(g) of the Code) 
HOUSE BILL  No provision. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The provision modifies section 904(g) by providing an election to increase the per-centage (but not greater than 100 percent) of domestic taxable income offset by any pre- 2018 unused overall domestic loss and re-characterized as foreign source. The term ‘‘pre-2018 unused overall domestic loss’’ means any overall domestic loss which: (1) arises in a qualified taxable year beginning before January 1, 2018, and (2) has not been used under the general rule set forth in sec-tion 904(g)(1). The term ‘‘qualified taxable year’’ means any taxable year of the tax-payer beginning after December 31, 2017, and before January 1, 2028. Effective date.—The provision shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the Sen-ate amendment. B. Rules Related to Passive and Mobile Income 1. Deduction for foreign-derived intangible income and global intangible low-taxed income (sec. 14202 of the Senate amend-ment and new sec. 250 of the Code) 
HOUSE BILL  No provision. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  In general The provision provides domestic corpora-tions with reduced rates of U.S. tax on their foreign-derived intangible income (‘‘FDII’’) and global intangible low-taxed income (‘‘GILTI’’).
1515GILTI is defined in section 14201 of the Senate amendment and new sec-tion 951A, while a domestic corporation’s FDII is the portion of its intangible income, determined on a formulaic basis, that is de-rived from serving foreign markets. For tax-able years beginning after December 31, 2017, and before January 1, 2019, the effective tax rate on FDII is 21.875 percent and the effec-tive U.S. tax rate on GILTI is 17.5 percent under the Senate amendment.
1516For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2018, and before January 1, 2026, the effective tax rate on FDII is 12.5 percent and the effective U.S. tax rate on GILTI is 10 percent. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025, the effective tax rate on FDII is 15.625 percent and the effective U.S. tax rate on GILTI is 12.5 percent. Deduction for FDII and GILTI Deduction for FDII and GILTI and taxable in-come limitation In the case of domestic corporations for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, and before January 1, 2026, the provision generally allows as a deduction an amount equal to the sum of 37.5 percent of its FDII plus 50 percent of its GILTI (if any). For tax-able years beginning after December 31, 2025, the deduction for FDII is reduced to 21.875 percent and the deduction for GILTI is low-ered to 37.5 percent.1517 If the sum of a domestic corporation’s FDII and GILTI amounts exceeds its taxable in-come determined without regard to this pro-vision, then the amount of FDII and GILTI for which a deduction is allowed is reduced by an amount determined by such excess. The reduction in FDII for which a deduction is allowed equals such excess multiplied by a percentage equal to the corporation’s FDII divided by the sum of its FDII and GILTI. The reduction in GILTI for which a deduc-tion is allowed equals the remainder of such excess.
1518 FDII The FDII of any domestic corporation is the amount which bears the same ratio to the corporation’s deemed intangible income as its foreign-derived deduction eligible in-come bears to its deduction eligible income. In other words, a domestic corporation’s FDII is its deemed intangible income multi-plied by the percentage of its deduction eli-gible income that is foreign-derived. The cal-culation can also be expressed as the fol-lowing: 
The Secretary is authorized to prescribe regulations or other guidance as may be nec-essary or appropriate to carry out this provi-sion. Deduction eligible income Deduction eligible income means, with re-spect to any domestic corporation, the ex-cess (if any) of the gross income of the cor-poration—determined without regard to cer-tain exceptions to deduction eligible in-come—over deductions (including taxes) properly allocable to such gross income (re-ferred to in this document as ‘‘deduction eli-gible gross income’’). The exceptions to de-duction eligible income are: (1) the subpart F income of the corporation determined under section 951; (2) the GILTI of the corporation; (3) any financial services income (as defined in section 904(d)(2)(D)) of the corporation; (4) any dividend received from a CFC with re-spect to which the corporation is a U.S. shareholder; and (5) any domestic oil and gas extraction income of the corporation; and (6) any foreign branch income (as defined in sec-tion 904(d)(2)(J)) of the corporation. The formula for deduction eligible income can generally be written as follows:
1519 Deduction Eligible Income = Gross Income¥Exceptions¥Allocable Deductions where Exceptions refers to the exceptions to deduction eligible income and Allocable De-ductions encompass all deductions (including taxes) property allocable to deduction eligi-ble gross income. Deemed intangible income The domestic corporation’s deemed intan-gible income means the excess (if any) of its deduction eligible income over its deemed tangible income return. The deemed tangible income return means, with respect to any corporation, an amount equal to 10 percent of the corporation’s qualified business asset investment (‘‘QBAI’’). Deemed intangible in-come can be calculated as follows:
1520 Deemed Intangible Income = Deduction Eligi-ble Income¥(10% × QBAI) For purposes of computing its FDII, a do-mestic corporation’s QBAI is the average of the aggregate of its adjusted bases, deter-mined as of the close of each quarter of the taxable year, in specified tangible property used in its trade or business and of a type with respect to which a deduction is allow-able under section 167. The adjusted basis in any property must be determined using the alternative depreciation system under sec-tion 168(g), notwithstanding any provision of law (or any other section of the Senate amendment) which is enacted after the date of enactment of this provision (unless such later enacted law specifically and directly amends this provision’s definition). Specified tangible property means any tan-gible property used in the production of de-duction eligible income. If such property was used in the production of deduction eligible income and income that is not deduction eli-gible income (i.e., dual-use property), the property is treated as specified tangible property in the same proportion that the amount of deduction eligible gross income produced with respect to the property bears to the total amount of gross income pro-duced with respect to the property.

year, $250 of which was domestic oil and gas extrac-tion income and the remaining $750 of which was de-duction eligible gross income, then 75 percent of a domestic corporation’s average adjusted basis in the building is included in QBAI for that taxable year. 
1522If property is sold by a taxpayer to a person who is not a U.S. person, and after such sale the property is subject to manufacture, assembly, or other processing (including the incorporation of such property, as a component, into a second prod-uct by means of production, manufacture, or assem-bly) outside the United States by such person, then the property is for a foreign use. 
1523In other words, the fact that a component is in-cluded in a piece of property that is eventually sold for a foreign use is insufficient for the sale of the component to be considered for a foreign use. 1524An S corporation’s taxable income is computed in the same manner as an individual (sec. 1363(b)) so that deductions allowable only to corporations, such as FDII and GILTI, do not apply. See Report by the House Committee on Ways and Means to accompany H.R. 6055, Subchapter S Revision Act of 1982, H. Rep. No. 97–826, p. 14; and Report by the Senate Com-mittee on Finance to accompany H.R. 6055, Sub-chapter S Revision Act of 1982, S. Rep. 97–640, p. 15. ∑The Code provides that deductions for corpora-tions provided in part VIII of subchapter B, which include the deduction for FDII and GILTI, do not apply in computing investment company taxable in-come (sec. 852(b)(2)(C)) or real estate investment trust taxable income (sec. 857(b)(2)(A)). Therefore, the deduction for FDII and GILTI does not apply to RICs or REITs. 
1525Due to the reduction in the effective U.S. tax rate resulting from the deduction for FDII and GILTI, the conferees expect the Secretary to pro-vide, as appropriate, regulations or other guidance similar to that under amended section 965 with re-spect to the determination of basis adjustments under section 705(a)(1) and the determination of gain or loss under section 986(c). 
152613.125 percent equals the effective GILTI rate of 10.5 percent divided by 80 percent. If the foreign tax rate on GILTI is 13.125 percent, and domestic corporations are allowed a credit equal to 80 percent of foreign taxes paid, then the post-credit foreign tax rate on GILTI equals 10.5 percent (= 13.125 per-cent × 80 percent), which equals the effective GILTI rate of 10.5 percent. Therefore, no U.S. residual tax is owed. 1527If the foreign tax rate on GILTI is zero percent, then the U.S. residual tax rate on GILTI is 13.125 percent. Therefore, as foreign tax rates on GILTI range between zero percent and 16.406 percent, the total combined foreign and U.S. tax rate on GILTI ranges between 13.125 percent and 16.406 percent. At foreign tax rates greater than or equal to 16.406 per-cent, there is no residual U.S. tax on GILTI, and the combined foreign and U.S. tax rate on GILTI equals the foreign tax rate. other words, the percentage of a domestic corporation’s adjusted basis in dual-use prop-erty that is included in QBAI equals the de-duction eligible gross income produced with respect to the property divided by the total gross income produced with respect to the property. Foreign-derived deduction eligible income Foreign-derived deduction eligible income means, with respect to a taxpayer for its tax-able year, any deduction eligible income of the taxpayer that is derived in connection with (1) property that is sold by the taxpayer to any person who is not a United States per-son and that the taxpayer establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary is for a foreign use
1522or (2) services provided by the tax-payer that the taxpayer establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary are provided to any person, or with respect to property, not located within the United States. Foreign use means any use, consumption, or disposi-tion that is not within the United States. Special rules for determining foreign use apply to transactions that involve property or services provided to domestic inter-mediaries or related parties. For purposes of the provision, the terms ‘‘sold,’’ ‘‘sells’’, and ‘‘sale’’ include any lease, license, exchange, or other disposition. Property or services provided to domestic inter-mediaries If a taxpayer sells property to another per-son (other than a related party) for further manufacture or modification within the United States, the property is generally not treated as sold for a foreign use even if such other person subsequently uses such prop-erty for foreign use. However, there is an ex-ception to this general rule for property (1) that is ultimately sold by a related party, or used by a related party in connection with property that is sold or the provision of serv-ices, to another person who is an unrelated party who is not a U.S. person and (2) that the taxpayer establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary is for a foreign use.
1523De- duction eligible income derived in connec-tion with services provided to another person (other than a related party) located within the United States is not treated as foreign- derived deduction eligible income, even if the other person uses the services in pro-viding services the income from which is considered foreign-derived deduction eligible income. Special rules with respect to related party trans-actions If property is sold to a related foreign party, the sale is not treated as for a foreign use unless the property is sold by the related foreign party to another person who is unre-lated and is not a U.S. person and the tax-payer establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary that such property is for a foreign use. Income derived in connection with serv-ices provided to a related party who is not located in the United States is not treated as foreign-derived deduction eligible income unless the taxpayer establishes to the satis-faction of the Secretary that such service is not substantially similar to services pro-vided by the related party to persons located within the United States. For purposes of applying these rules, a re-lated party means any member of an affili-ated group as defined in section 1504(a) deter-mined by substituting ‘‘more than 50 per-cent’’ for ‘‘at least 80 percent’’ each place it appears and without regard to sections 1504(b)(2) and 1504(b)(3). Any person (other than a corporation) is treated as a member of the affiliated group if the person is con-trolled by members of the group (including any entity treated as a member of the group by reason of this sentence) or controls any member, with control being determined under the rules of section 954(d)(3). Effective date.—The provision is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the Sen-ate amendment, with clarifications and modifications that include the following: ∑The deduction for FDII and GILTI is available only to C corporations that are not RICs or REITs.
1524 ∑The deduction for GILTI applies to the amount treated as a dividend received by a domestic corporation under section 78 that is attributable to the corporation’s GILTI amount under new section 951A. ∑The exclusions from deduction eligible income are clarified. ∑The definition of deemed tangible in-come return is clarified. Illustration of effective tax rates on FDII and GILTI Under a 21-percent corporate tax rate, and as a result of the deduction for FDII and GILTI, the effective tax rate on FDII is 13.125 percent and the effective U.S. tax rate on GILTI (with respect to domestic corpora-tions) is 10.5 percent for taxable years begin-ning after December 31, 2017, and before Jan-uary 1, 2026.
1525Since only a portion (80 per-cent) of foreign tax credits are allowed to offset U.S. tax on GILTI, the minimum for-eign tax rate, with respect to GILTI, at which no U.S. residual tax is owed by a do-mestic corporation is 13.125 percent.
1526If the foreign tax rate on GILTI is zero percent, then the U.S. residual tax rate on GILTI is 10.5 percent. Therefore, as foreign tax rates on GILTI range between zero percent and 13.125 percent, the total combined foreign and U.S. tax rate on GILTI ranges between 10.5 percent and 13.125 percent. At foreign tax rates greater than or equal to 13.125 percent, there is no residual U.S. tax owed on GILTI, so that the combined foreign and U.S. tax rate on GILTI equals the foreign tax rate. For domestic corporations in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025, the effec-tive tax rate on FDII is 16.406 percent and the effective U.S. tax rate on GILTI is 13.125 percent. The minimum foreign tax rate, with respect to GILTI, at which no U.S. residual tax is owed is 16.406 percent.1527 Effective date.—The provision is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 2. Special rules for transfers of intangible property from controlled foreign corpora-tions to United States shareholders (sec. 14203 of the Senate amendment and new sec. 966 of the Code) 
HOUSE BILL  No provision. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  For certain distributions of intangible property held by a CFC on the date of enact-ment of this provision, the fair market value of the property on the date of the distribu-tion is treated as not exceeding the adjusted basis of the property immediately before the distribution. If the distribution is not a divi-dend, a U.S. shareholder’s adjusted basis in the stock of the CFC with respect to which the distribution is made is increased by the amount (if any) of the distribution that would, but for this provision, be includible in gross income. The adjusted basis of the prop-erty in the hands of the U.S. shareholder im-mediately after the distribution is the ad-justed basis immediately before the distribu-tion, reduced by the amount of the increase (if any) described previously. For purposes of the provision, intangible property means intangible property as de-scribed in section 936(h)(3)(B) and computer software as described in section 197(e)(3)(B). The provision applies to distributions that are (1) received by a domestic corporation from a CFC with respect to which it is a U.S. shareholder and (2) made by the CFC before the last day of the third taxable year of the CFC beginning after December 31, 2017. Effective date.—The provision is effective for taxable years of foreign corporations be-ginning after December 31, 2017, and for tax-able years of U.S. shareholders in which or with which such taxable years of foreign cor-porations end. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement does not include the Senate amendment provision. C. Modifications Related to Foreign Tax Credit System 1. Repeal of section 902 indirect foreign tax credits; determination of section 960 credit on current year basis (sec. 4101 of the House bill, sec. 14301 of the Senate amendment, and secs. 902 and 960 of the Code) 
HOUSE BILL  The provision repeals the deemed-paid credit with respect to dividends received by a domestic corporation that owns 10 percent or more of the voting stock of a foreign cor-poration.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H10117 December 15, 2017 
1528See Treas. Reg. sec. 1.904–6(a). A deemed-paid credit is provided with re-spect to any income inclusion under subpart F. The deemed-paid credit is limited to the amount of foreign income taxes properly at-tributable to the subpart F inclusion. For-eign income taxes under the proposal include income, war profits, or excess profits taxes paid or accrued by the CFC to any foreign country or possession of the United States. The proposal eliminates the need for com-puting and tracking cumulative tax pools. Additionally, the provision provides rules applicable to foreign taxes attributable to distributions from previously taxed earnings and profits, including distributions made through tiered-CFCs. The Secretary is granted authority under the proposal to provide regulations and other guidance as may be necessary and appro-priate to carry out the purposes of this pro-posal. It is anticipated that the Secretary would provide regulations with rules for allo-cating taxes similar to rules in place for pur-poses of determining the allocation of taxes to specific foreign tax credit baskets.
1528 Under such rules, taxes are not attributable to an item of subpart F income if the base upon which the tax was imposed does not in-clude the item of subpart F income. For ex-ample, if foreign law exempts a certain type of income from its tax base, no deemed-paid credit results from the inclusion of such in-come as subpart F. Tax imposed on income that is not included in subpart F income, is not considered attributable to subpart F in-come. In addition to the rules described in this section, the proposal makes several con-forming amendments to various other sec-tions of the Code reflecting the repeal of sec-tion 902 and the modification of section 960. These conforming amendments include amending the section 78 gross-up provision to apply solely to taxes deemed paid under the amended section 960. Effective date.—The provision applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The Senate amendment is the same as the House bill, except with respect to certain conforming amendments. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the House bill with the following modifications. The conference agreement applies the exist-ing language of section 78, which treats the gross-up as a dividend to the domestic cor-poration, to foreign income taxes deemed paid under section 960(a), (b), and (d) (with-out regard to the phrase ‘80 percent of’ in section 960(d)(1), except with respect to sec-tion 245 and new section 245A (i.e., the deemed dividend would not receive the ben-efit of the participation exemption). The conference agreement further revises new section 250(a)(1)(B) to apply the deduction with respect to inclusions under new section 951A to the section 78 gross-up. In addition, the conference agreement eliminates the dividend reference in section 907(c)(3)(A) without disturbing the applica-tion of section 907(c)(3)(A) to certain interest payments. The conference agreement also amends section 1293(f) to provide section 960(a) credits to an inclusion of income of a qualified electing fund (as defined in section 1295) consistent with present law. The conference agreement makes certain conforming amendments to sections 901(m), 904, 907, and 909, including replacing the ref-erence to section 960(b) in section 904(k) to section 960(c), striking the reference to sec-tion 902 in section 904(d)(2)(E), and pre-serving the current applicability of sections 901(m) and 909 to all taxpayers who claim foreign tax credits, including qualified elect-ing funds. Effective date.—The provision applies to taxable years taxable years of foreign cor-porations beginning after December 31, 2017, and to taxable years of United States share-holders in which or with which such taxable years of foreign corporations end. 2. Source of income from sales of inventory determined solely on basis of production activities (sec. 4102 of the House bill, sec. 14304 of the Senate amendment, and sec. 863(b) of the Code) HOUSE BILL  Under the provision, gains, profits, and in-come from the sale or exchange of inventory property produced partly in, and partly out-side, the United States is allocated and ap-portioned on the basis of the location of pro-duction with respect to the property. For ex-ample, income derived from the sale of in-ventory property to a foreign jurisdiction is sourced wholly within the United States if the property was produced entirely in the United States, even if title passage occurred elsewhere. Likewise, income derived from in-ventory property sold in the United States, but produced entirely in another country, is sourced in that country even if title passage occurs in the United States. If the inventory property is produced partly in, and partly outside, the United States, however, the in-come derived from its sale is sourced partly in the United States. Effective date.—The provision is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The Senate amendment is identical to the House bill. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the House bill and the Senate amendment. 3. Separate foreign tax credit limitation bas-ket for foreign branch income (sec. 14302 of the Senate amendment and sec. 904 of the Code) 
HOUSE BILL  No provision. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The provision requires foreign branch in-come to be allocated to a specific foreign tax credit basket. Foreign branch income is the business profits of a United States person which are attributable to one or more QBUs in one or more foreign countries. Under this provision, business profits of a QBU shall be determined under rules estab-lished by the Secretary. Business profits of a QBU shall not, however, include any income which is passive category income. Effective date.—The provision is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the Sen-ate amendment. 4. Acceleration of election to allocate inter-est, etc., on a worldwide basis (sec. 14303 of the Senate amendment and sec. 864 of the Code) 
HOUSE BILL  No provision. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  This provision accelerates the effective date of the worldwide interest allocation rules to apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, rather than to tax-able years beginning after December 31, 2020. Effective date.—The provision is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement does not include the Senate amendment provision. D. Modification of Subpart F Provisions 1. Repeal of inclusion based on withdrawal of previously excluded subpart F income from qualified investment (sec. 4201 of the House bill, sec. 14213 of the Senate amendment, and sec. 955 of the Code) 
HOUSE BILL  The provision repeals section 955. As a re-sult, a U.S. shareholder in a CFC that in-vested its previously excluded subpart F in-come in qualified foreign base company ship-ping operations is no longer required to in-clude in income a pro rata share of the pre-viously excluded subpart F income when the CFC decreases such investments. Effective date.—The provision is effective for taxable years of foreign corporations be-ginning after December 31, 2017, and to tax-able years of U.S. shareholders within which or with which such taxable years of foreign corporations end. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The Senate amendment follows the House bill. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the House bill and the Senate amendment. 2. Repeal of treatment of foreign base com-pany oil related income as subpart F in-come (sec. 4202 of the House bill, sec. 14211 of the Senate amendment, and sec. 954(a) of the Code) 
HOUSE BILL  The provision eliminates foreign base com-pany oil related income as a category of for-eign base company income. Effective date.—The provision is effective for taxable years of foreign corporations be-ginning after December 31, 2017, and for tax-able years of U.S. shareholders in which or with which such taxable years of foreign cor-porations end. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The Senate amendment is the same as the House bill. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the House bill and the Senate amendment. Effective date.—The provision is effective for taxable years of foreign corporations be-ginning after December 31, 2017, and for tax-able years of U.S. shareholders in which or with which such taxable years of foreign cor-porations end. 3. Inflation adjustment of de minimis excep-tion for foreign base company income (sec. 4203 of the House bill, sec. 14212 of the Senate amendment, and sec. 954(b)(3) of the Code) 
HOUSE BILL  The provision amends the de minimis ex-ception of present law, which permits a CFC to exclude its foreign base company income if the sum of its total foreign base company income and gross insurance income is the lesser of five percent of its gross income or $1,000,000. In the case of any taxable year be-ginning after 2017, the provision indexes for inflation the $1,000,000 de minimis amount for foreign base company income, with all increases rounded to the nearest multiple of $50,000. Effective date.—The provision is effective for taxable years of foreign corporations be-ginning after December 31, 2017, and for tax-able years of U.S. shareholders in which or with which such taxable years of foreign cor-porations end. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The Senate amendment is the same as the House bill.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH10118 December 15, 2017 
1529Committee Print, Reconciliation Recommenda-tions Pursuant to H. Con. Res. 71, S. Prt. 115–20, (De- cember 2017), p. 378, as reprinted on the website of the Senate Budget Committee, available at https:// www.budget.senate.gov/taxreform. 1530If the amount of interest expense exceeds [(7% + AFR) × QBAI], then the quantity in brackets in the formula equals zero in the determination of FHRA. 
1531ECI includes income that is subject to the elec-tion described in section 4303 of the House bill and new sec. 4491. As a result, income that a CFC derives from certain sales to the U.S. market is excluded from the FHRA calculation and is subject to new sec. 4491, to the extent that the sales are made to a related party. CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement does not include the House bill or the Senate amendment pro-vision. 4. Look-thru rule for related controlled for-eign corporations made permanent (sec. 4204 of the House bill, sec. 14217 of the Senate amendment, and sec. 954(c)(6) of the Code) 
HOUSE BILL  The provision makes the exclusion from foreign personal holding company income for certain dividends, interest (including fac-toring income that is treated as equivalent to interest under section 954(c)(1)(E)), rents, and royalties received or accrued by one CFC from a related CFC permanent. Effective date.—The proposal is effective for taxable years of foreign corporations begin-ning after December 31, 2019, and for taxable years of U.S. shareholders in which or with which such taxable years of foreign corpora-tions end. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The Senate amendment is the same as the House bill. Effective date.—The proposal is effective for taxable years of foreign corporations begin-ning after December 31, 2017, and for taxable years of U.S. shareholders in which or with which such taxable years of foreign corpora-tions end. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement does not include the House bill or the Senate amendment pro-vision. 5. Modification of stock attribution rules for determining CFC status (sec. 4205 of the House bill, sec. 14214 of the Senate amendment, and secs. 318 and 958 of the Code) 
HOUSE BILL  The provision amends the ownership attri-bution rules of section 958(b) so that certain stock of a foreign corporation owned by a foreign person is attributed to a related U.S. person for purposes of determining whether the related U.S. person is a U.S. shareholder of the foreign corporation and, therefore, whether the foreign corporation is a CFC. In other words, the provision provides ‘‘down-ward attribution’’ from a foreign person to a related U.S. person in circumstances in which present law does not so provide. The pro rata share of a CFC’s subpart F income that a U.S. shareholder is required to include in gross income, however, continues to be de-termined based on direct or indirect owner-ship of the CFC, without application of the new downward attribution rule. It also conforms the reporting require-ments of section 6038 to require that entities that are treated as CFCs by reason of the rules on constructive ownership are within the scope of the reporting requirements. Effective date.—The provision is effective for taxable years of foreign corporations be-ginning after December 31, 2017, and to tax-able years of U.S. shareholders in which or with which such taxable years of foreign cor-porations end. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The Senate amendment is similar to the House bill, except that it does not adopt the change to the reporting requirements of sec-tion 6038 and has a different effective date. Furthermore, the Senate Finance Com-mittee explanation states that the provision is not intended to cause a foreign corpora-tion to be treated as a controlled foreign cor-poration with respect to a U.S. shareholder as a result of attribution of ownership under section 318(a)(3) to a U.S. person that is not a related person (within the meaning of sec-tion 954(d)(3)) to such U.S. shareholder as a result of the repeal of section 958(b)(4).1529 Effective date.—The provision is effective for the last taxable year of foreign corpora-tions beginning before January 1, 2018 and each subsequent year of such foreign cor-porations and for the taxable years of U.S. shareholders in which or with which such taxable years of foreign corporations end. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the Sen-ate amendment. In adopting this provision, the conferees intend to render ineffective certain transactions that are used to as a means of avoiding the subpart F provisions. One such transaction involves effectuating ‘‘de-control’’ of a foreign subsidiary, by tak-ing advantage of the section 958(b)(4) rule that effectively turns off the constructive stock ownership rules of 318(a)(3) when to do otherwise would result in a U.S. person being treated as owning stock owned by a foreign person. Such a transaction converts former CFCs to non-CFCs, despite continuous own-ership by U.S. shareholders. Effective date.—The provision is effective for the last taxable year of foreign corpora-tions beginning before January 1, 2018 and each subsequent year of such foreign cor-porations and for the taxable years of U.S. shareholders in which or with which such taxable years of foreign corporations end. 6. Modification of definition of United States shareholder (sec. 14215 of the Senate amendment and sec. 951 of the Code) 
HOUSE BILL  No provision. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The provision expands the definition of U.S. shareholder under subpart F to include any U.S. person who owns 10 percent or more of the total value of shares of all classes of stock of a foreign corporation. Effective date.—The provision is effective for taxable years of foreign corporations be-ginning after December 31, 2017, and for tax-able years of U.S. shareholders with or with-in which such taxable years of foreign cor-porations end. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the Sen-ate amendment. 7. Elimination of requirement that corpora-tion must be controlled for 30 days before subpart F inclusions apply (sec. 4206 of the House bill, sec. 14216 of the Senate amendment, and sec. 951(a)(1) of the Code) 
HOUSE BILL  The provision eliminates the requirement that a corporation must be controlled for an uninterrupted period of 30 days before sub-part F inclusions apply. Effective date.—The provision is effective for taxable years of foreign corporations be-ginning after December 31, 2017, and for tax-able years of U.S. shareholders with or with-in which such taxable years of foreign cor-porations end. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The Senate amendment is the same as the House bill. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the House bill and the Senate amendment. Effective date.—The provision is effective for taxable years of foreign corporations be-ginning after December 31, 2017, and for tax-able years of U.S. shareholders with or with-in which such taxable years of foreign cor-porations end. 8. Current year inclusion of foreign high re-turn amounts or global intangible low- taxed income by United States share-holders (sec. 4301 of the House bill, sec. 14201 of the Senate amendment, and secs. 78 and 960 and new sec. 951A of the Code) HOUSE BILL  In general Under the provision, a U.S. shareholder of any CFC must include in gross income for a taxable year an amount equal to 50 percent of its foreign high return amount (‘‘FHRA’’) in a manner generally similar to inclusions of subpart F income. FHRA means, with re-spect to any U.S. shareholder for the share-holder’s taxable year, the shareholder’s net CFC tested income less an amount equal to the excess (if any) of (1) the applicable per-centage of the aggregate of the shareholder’s pro rata share of the qualified business asset investment (‘‘QBAI’’) of each CFC with re-spect to which it is a U.S. shareholder over (2) the amount of interest expense taken into account in determining the shareholder’s net CFC tested income. The applicable percent-age is the Federal short-term rate (deter-mined under section 1274(d) for the month in which such shareholder’s taxable year ends) plus seven percentage points. The formula for FHRA, which is calculated at the U.S. shareholder level, is gen-erally:
1530 FHRA = Net CFC Tested Income – [(7% + AFR) × QBAI – Interest Expense] where AFR is the short-term Federal rate. Net CFC tested income Net CFC tested income means, with re-spect to any U.S. shareholder, the excess of the aggregate of its pro rata share of the tested income of each CFC with respect to which it is a U.S. shareholder over the aggre-gate of its pro rata share of the tested loss of each CFC with respect to which it is a U.S. shareholder. Pro rata shares are determined under the rules of section 951(a)(2). The formula for net CFC tested income, which is calculated at the U.S. shareholder level, is: Net CFC Tested Income = Sum of CFC Tested Income – Sum of CFC Tested Loss The tested income of a CFC means the ex-cess (if any) of the gross income of the cor-poration determined without regard to cer-tain exceptions to tested income, over deduc-tions (including taxes) properly allocable to such gross income. The exceptions to tested income are: (1) the corporation’s ECI if the income is subject to tax;
1531(2) any gross in-come taken into account in determining the corporation’s subpart F income; (3) any amount, except as otherwise provided by the Secretary, that qualifies for CFC look- through treatment, but only to the extent that any deduction allowable for the pay-ment or accrual of such amount does not re-sult in a reduction of the FHRA of any U.S. shareholder (determined without regard to such amount); (4) any gross income excluded as foreign personal holding company income by reason of the exceptions for active financ-ing income and active insurance income as well as the exception for dealers under sec-tion 954(c)(2)(C); (5) any gross income ex-cluded from foreign base company income or

1533Sec. 907(c)(2). 1534The section 78 gross-up amount = 100 percent × 97.1 percent × $105 = 101.90. insurance income by reason of the high-tax exception under section 954(b)(4); (6) any div-idend received from a related person (as de-fined in section 954(d)(3)); and (7) any com-modities gross income. Commodities gross income means (1) gross income of a corporation (or of a partnership in which the corporation is a partner) from the disposition of commodities that it has produced or extracted and that are commod-ities described in sections 475(e)(2)(A) and 475(e)(2)(D), and (2) the gross income of the corporation from the disposition of property that gives rise to income described in (1). Commodities income is intended to include any foreign oil and gas extraction income
1532 and any foreign oil related income.
1533 The tested loss of a CFC means the excess (if any) of the deductions (including taxes) properly allocable to the corporation’s gross income determined without regard to the tested income exceptions over the amount of such gross income. Qualified business asset investment QBAI means, with respect to any CFC for a taxable year, the aggregate of its adjusted bases (determined as of the close of the tax-able year and after any adjustments with re-spect to such taxable year) in specified tan-gible property used in its trade or business and with respect to which a deduction is al-lowable under section 168. Specified tangible property means any tangible property to the extent such property is used in the produc-tion of tested income or tested loss. The ad-justed basis in any property is determined without regard to any provision of law that is enacted after the date of enactment of this provision, unless such law specifically and directly amends this provision’s definition. If a CFC holds an interest in a partnership as of the close of the corporation’s taxable year, the corporation takes into account its distributive share of the aggregate of the partnership’s adjusted bases (determined as of such date in the hands of the partnership) in tangible property held by the partnership to the extent that such property is used in the trade or business of the partnership, is of a type with respect to which a deduction is allowable under section 168, and is used in the production of tested income or tested loss (determined with respect to the corpora-tion’s distributive share of income or loss with respect to such property). The corpora-tion’s distributive share of the adjusted basis of any property is the corporation’s distribu-tive share of income and loss with respect to such property. For purposes of determining QBAI, the Secretary is authorized to issue anti-avoid-ance regulations or other guidance as the Secretary determines appropriate, including regulations or other guidance that provide for the treatment of property if the property is transferred or held temporarily, or if avoidance was a factor in the transfer or holding of the property. Foreign tax credits and coordination with subpart F Deemed-paid credit for taxes properly attrib-utable to tested income For any FHRA included in the gross in-come of a domestic corporation, the corpora-tion is deemed to have paid foreign income taxes equal to 80 percent of its foreign high return percentage multiplied by the aggre-gate tested foreign income taxes paid or ac-crued by each CFC with respect to which the corporation is a U.S. shareholder. The for-eign high return percentage is the corpora-tion’s FHRA divided by the aggregate amount of its pro rata share of the tested in-come of each CFC with respect to which it is a U.S. shareholder. Tested foreign income taxes are the foreign income taxes paid or accrued by a CFC that are properly attrib-utable to gross income taken into account in determining tested income or tested loss. The provision creates a separate foreign tax credit basket for the FHRA inclusion, with no carryforward or carryback available for excess credits. For purpose of deter-mining the foreign tax credit limitation, any FHRA is not general category income, and income that can be classified as both a FHRA and passive category income is con-sidered passive category income. The taxes deemed to have been paid are treated as an increase in the FHRA for purposes of section 78, determined by taking into account 100 percent of its foreign high return percentage multiplied by the aggregate tested foreign income taxes. Coordination with subpart F Although FHRA inclusions do not con-stitute subpart F income, FHRA inclusions are generally treated similarly to subpart F inclusions. Thus, with respect to any CFC any pro rata amount from which is taken into account in determining the FHRA in-cluded in gross income of a U.S. shareholder, such amount, except as otherwise provided by the Secretary, is treated in the same manner as an amount included under section 951(a)(1)(A) for purposes of applying sections 168(h)(2)(B), 535(b)(10), 851(b), 904(h)(1), 959, 961, 962, 993(a)(1)(E), 996(f)(1), 1248(b)(1), 1248(d)(1), 6501(e)(1)(C), 6654(d)(2)(D), and 6655(e)(4). The provision requires that the amount of FHRA included by a U.S. corporation be allo-cated across each CFC with respect to which it is a U.S. shareholder. The portion of the FHRA treated as being with respect to a CFC equals zero for a foreign corporation with tested loss and, for a foreign corporation with tested income, the portion of the FHRA which bears the same ratio to the total FHRA as the shareholder’s pro rata amount of the tested income of the foreign corpora-tion bears to the aggregate amount of the shareholder’s pro rata share of the tested in-come of each CFC with respect to which it is a U.S. shareholder. Tested losses taken into account in deter-mining a U.S. shareholder’s FHRA cannot also reduce the shareholder’s inclusions in gross income under section 951(a)(1)(A) by reason of the earnings and profits limitation in section 952(c). Accordingly, a U.S. share-holder’s amount included in gross income under section 951(a)(1)(A) with respect to a CFC is determined by increasing the earn-ings and profits of such corporation (solely for purposes of determining such amount) by an amount that bears the same ratio (not greater than 1) to the shareholder’s pro rata share of the tested loss of such CFC as (1) the aggregate amount of the shareholder’s pro rata share of the tested income of each CFC with respect to which it is a U.S. shareholder bears to (2) the aggregate amount of the shareholder’s tested loss of each CFC with respect to which it is a U.S. shareholder. If this increase in earnings and profits results in an incremental inclusion under section 951(a)(1)(A, the CFC will increases its earn-ings and profits described in section 959(c)(2) by that amount and decrease its earnings and profits in section 959(c)(3) by that amount (even if that results in, or increases, a deficit). Taxable years for which persons are treated as U.S. shareholders of a CFC For purposes of the FHRA inclusion, a U.S. shareholder of a CFC is treated as a U.S. shareholder of the corporation for any tax-able year of the shareholder if a taxable year of the corporation ends in or with the tax-able year of such person and the person owns (within the meaning of section 958(a)) stock in the corporation on the last day in the tax-able year of the corporation on which the corporation is a CFC. A corporation is gen-erally treated as a CFC for any taxable year if the corporation is a CFC at any time dur-ing the taxable year. Examples The following examples illustrate how FHRA is calculated. The examples are highly stylized and are not meant to represent ac-tual taxpayer scenarios. Example 1: Two Wholly Owned CFCs, Each with Tested Income Assume a domestic corporation, US1, whol-ly owns two CFCs, CFC1 and CFC2. These are the only CFCs with respect to which US1 is a U.S. shareholder. Assume that the applica-ble percentage to be applied to QBAI is 10 percent. The following table includes more information about CFC1 and CFC2. Assume that their foreign sales income are items of gross income included in the computation of tested income, and that all expenses are allo-cable to their foreign sales income. Also as-sume a U.S. corporate tax rate of 20 percent, and that the foreign tax rates faced by CFC1 and CFC2 are applied evenly across each of its sources of income. Facts for Example 1

CFC-level calculations of tested income and QBAI CFC1 earns foreign sales income of $300 and has deductions of $220 (= $20 of taxes plus $200 of operating expenses) allocable to its for-eign sales income. Therefore, it has tested income of $80 (= $300 – $220) and tested for-eign income tax of $20 (= 20% × $100). CFC1 has QBAI of $500. CFC2 earns foreign sales income of $2,000 and has deductions of $385 (= $85 of taxes plus $300 of operating expenses) allocable to its foreign sales income. Therefore, it has tested income of $1,615 (= $2,000 – $385) and tested foreign income tax of $85 (= 5% × $1,700). CFC2 has QBAI of $0. U.S.-shareholder-level calculation of FHRA and tax liability US1 has net CFC tested income of $1,695, which is the sum of CFC1’s tested income of $80 and CFC2’s tested income of $1,615. Its pro rata share of QBAI is $500 (= [100% × $500] + [100% × $0]). No interest expense is taken into account in determining US1’s net CFC tested income. Therefore, US1’s FHRA = $1,695 – ([10% × $500] – $0) = $1,645. US1 receives a deemed-paid credit equal to 80 percent of its foreign high return percent-age multiplied by the aggregate tested for-eign income taxes paid or accrued by CFC1 and CFC2. Its foreign high return percentage is 97.1 percent (= FHRA/Aggregate Tested In-come = $1,645/$1,695). The aggregate tested foreign income taxes paid or accrued by CFC1 and CFC2 is $105 (= $20 + $85). There-fore, US1’s deemed-paid credit is 80 percent × 97.1 percent × $105 = $81.52. US1 includes 50 percent of its FHRA and 50 percent of its section 78 gross-up in gross in-come, or $873.45 (= 50% × [$1,645 + $101.90]).

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH10120 December 15, 2017 
1535The section 78 gross-up amount = 100 percent × 6.25 percent × $105 = $6.56. 
1536Specified tangible property does not include property used in the production of tested loss, so that a CFC that has a tested loss in a taxable year does not have QBAI for the taxable year. 
1537For example, if a building produces $1,000 of tested gross income and $250 of subpart F income for a taxable year, then 80 percent (= $1,000/$1,250) of a domestic corporation’s average adjusted basis in the building is included in QBAI for that taxable year. The tentative U.S. tax owed on this income is the U.S. corporate tax rate of 20 percent applied to the total inclusion of $873.45, or $174.69. The residual U.S. tax paid by US1 on its FHRA is its tentative U.S. tax of $174.69 less its deemed-paid credit of $81.52, or $93.17. Example 2: Variant of Example 1, With Tested Loss Example 2 generally has the same facts as example 1, except that CFC2 earns foreign sales of $360. This means that CFC2 has test-ed income (before taking into account taxes) of $60. Assume, for simplicity, that it still pays foreign taxes of $85 with respect to the $360 of foreign sales, so that its tested loss is $25 (= $60 – $85) and its tested foreign income tax is $85. Like in Example 1, CFC1 has tested income of $80 and tested foreign income tax of $20. U.S.-shareholder-level calculation of FHRA and tax liability US1 has net CFC tested income of $55, which is CFC1’s tested income of $80 less CFC2’s tested loss of $25. Its pro rata share of QBAI is $500 (= [100% × $500] + [100% × $0]). No interest expense is taken into account in de-termining US1’s net CFC tested income. Therefore, US1’s FHRA = $55 – (10% × $500) – $0 = $5. US1 receives a deemed-paid credit equal to 80 percent of its foreign high return percent-age multiplied by the aggregate tested for-eign income taxes paid or accrued by CFC1 and CFC2. Its foreign high return percentage is 6.25 percent (= FHRA/Aggregate Tested In-come = $5/$80). The aggregate tested foreign income taxes paid or accrued by CFC1 and CFC2 is $105 (= $20 + $85). Therefore, US1’s deemed-paid credit is 80 percent × 6.25 per- cent × $105 = $5.25. US1 includes 50 percent of its FHRA in gross income and 50 percent of its section 78 gross-up in gross income, or $5.78 (= 50% × [$5 + $6.56]).
1535The tentative U.S. tax owed on this income is the U.S. corporate tax rate of 20 percent applied to the total inclusion of $5.78, or $1.16. The residual U.S. tax paid by US1 on its FHRA is its tentative U.S. tax of $1.16 less its deemed-paid credit of $5.25, or $0. The amount of US1’s deemed-paid credit that is unused, $4.09, may not be carried back or carried forward. Example 3: CFC Look-Through Payment Example 3 illustrates how the FHRA cal-culation is applied when there are payments that qualify for CFC look-through treat-ment. Example 3 is limited to the calcula-tion of the FHRA and does not provide cal-culations of the amount of U.S. or foreign in-come tax related to the FHRA. USCo, a domestic corporation, wholly owns US1 and US2, each a domestic corporation. US1 wholly owns CFC1, and US2 wholly owns CFC2. These are the only CFCs with respect to which either US1 or US2 is a U.S. share-holder. Assume the applicable percentage for QBAI is 10 percent. CFC1 has total gross income of $100, none of which consists of a tested income excep-tion, and has interest expense of $30, which it pays to CFC2. CFC1 has no other deductions and has QBAI of $200. As a result, CFC1 has tested income of $70 (= $100 of gross income less $30 of interest expense). US1’s net CFC tested income is $70 and the applicable per-centage of its pro rata share of QBAI is $20 (= 10% × $200). As CFC1’s interest expense of $30 was taken into account in determining its tested income of $70, the excess of US1’s ap-plicable percentage of QBAI over this amount of interest expense is $0. As a result, US1’s FHRA is $70 (= $70 ¥ $0). CFC2 has $30 of interest income, all of which qualifies for CFC look-through treat-ment because CFC1 has no subpart F income. Assume CFC2 has no other gross income, no deductions, and no QBAI. CFC2’s interest in-come is not includible in its tested income, but only to the extent a deduction for its payment or accrual does not reduce the FHRA of any U.S. shareholder. Absent the $30 interest expense deduction used in deter-mining its net CFC tested income, US1’s net CFC tested income would have been $100, and US1’s FHRA would have been $80 (= $100 ¥ $20). With the $30 deduction, US1’s net CFC’s tested income is $70. Therefore, the deduc-tion allowable for the payment or accrual of the interest reduced the FHRA of US1 by $10, so only $20 of CFC2’s interest income is ex-cluded from tested income. As a result, CFC2 has tested income of $10 (= $30 ¥ $20), and US2 has net CFC tested income of $10 (=$10 ¥ $0). Effective date.—The provision is effective for taxable years of foreign corporations be-ginning after December 31, 2017, and for tax-able years of U.S. shareholders in which or with which such taxable years of foreign cor-porations end. SENATE AMENDMENT  In general Under the provision, a U.S. shareholder of any CFC must include in gross income for a taxable year its global intangible low-taxed income (‘‘GILTI’’) in a manner generally similar to inclusions of subpart F income. GILTI means, with respect to any U.S. share-holder for the shareholder’s taxable year, the excess (if any) of the shareholder’s net CFC tested income over the shareholder’s net deemed tangible income return. The share-holder’s net deemed tangible income return is an amount equal to 10 percent of the ag-gregate of the shareholder’s pro rata share of the qualified business asset investment (‘‘QBAI’’) of each CFC with respect to which it is a U.S. shareholder. The formula for GILTI, which is calculated at the U.S. shareholder level, is: GILTI = Net CFC Tested Income ¥ (10% × QBAI) Net CFC tested income Net CFC tested income means, with re-spect to any U.S. shareholder, the excess of the aggregate of the shareholder’s pro rata share of the tested income of each CFC with respect to which it is a U.S. shareholder over the aggregate of its pro rata share of the tested loss of each CFC with respect to which it is a U.S. shareholder. Pro rata shares are determined under the rules of section 951(a)(2). The formula for net CFC tested income, which is calculated at the U.S. shareholder level, is: Net CFC Tested Income = Sum of CFC Tested Income ¥ Sum of CFC Tested Loss The tested income of a CFC means the ex-cess (if any) of the gross income of the cor-poration—determined without regard to cer-tain exceptions to tested income—over de-ductions (including taxes) properly allocable to such gross income (referred to in this doc-ument as ‘‘tested gross income’’). The excep-tions to tested income are: (1) the corpora-tion’s ECI under section 952(b); (2) any gross income taken into account in determining the corporation’s subpart F income; (3) any gross income excluded from foreign base company income or insurance income by rea-son of the high-tax exception under section 954(b)(4); (4) any dividend received from a re-lated person (as defined in section 954(d)(3)); and (5) any foreign oil and gas extraction in-come (as defined in section 907(c)(1)). The tested loss of a CFC means the excess (if any) of deductions (including taxes) prop-erly allocable to the corporation’s gross in-come—determined without regard to the tested income exceptions—over the amount of such gross income. Qualified business asset investment QBAI means, with respect to any CFC for a taxable year, the average of the aggregate of its adjusted bases, determined as of the close of each quarter of the taxable year, in speci-fied tangible property used in its trade or business and of a type with respect to which a deduction is generally allowable under sec-tion 167. The adjusted basis in any property must be determined using the alternative de-preciation system under current section 168(g), notwithstanding any provision of law (or any other section of the Senate amend-ment) which is enacted after the date of en-actment of this provision (unless such later enacted law specifically and directly amends this provision’s definition). Specified tangible property means any property used in the production of tested in-come.1536If such property was used in the production of both tested income and income that is not tested income (i.e., dual-use prop-erty), the property is treated as specified tangible property in the same proportion that the amount of tested gross income pro-duced with respect to the property bears to the total amount of gross income produced with respect to the property.
1537 For purposes of determining QBAI, the Secretary is authorized to issue anti-avoid-ance regulations or other guidance as the Secretary determines appropriate, including regulations or other guidance that provide for the treatment of property if the property is transferred or held temporarily, or if avoidance was a factor in the transfer or holding of the property. Coordination with subpart F Although GILTI inclusions do not con-stitute subpart F income, GILTI inclusions are generally treated similarly to subpart F inclusions. Thus they are generally treated in the same manner as amounts included under section 951(a)(1)(A) for purposes of ap-plying sections 168(h)(2)(B), 535(b)(10), 904(h)(1), 959, 961, 962, 993(a)(1)(E), 996(f)(1), 1248(b)(1), 1248(d)(1), 6501(e)(1)(C), 6654(d)(2)(D), and 6655(e)(4). However, the Sec-retary may provide rules for coordinating the GILTI inclusion with provisions of law in which the determination of subpart F in-come is required to be made at the CFC level. The provision requires that the amount of GILTI included by a U.S. shareholder be allo-cated across each CFC with respect to which it is a U.S. shareholder. The portion of GILTI treated as being with respect to a CFC equals zero for a CFC with no tested income and, for a CFC with tested income, the portion of GILTI which bears the same ratio to the total amount of GILTI as the U.S. share-holder’s pro rata amount of tested income of the CFC bears to the aggregate amount of the U.S. shareholder’s pro rata amount of the tested income of each CFC with respect to which it is a U.S. shareholder. For a CFC with tested income, the following formula expresses how to determine the portion of GILTI treated as being with respect to the CFC:

1538Tested foreign income taxes do not include any foreign income tax paid or accrued by a CFC that is properly attributable to the CFC’s tested loss (if any). 1539If the amount of interest expense exceeds 10% × QBAI, then the quantity in brackets in the for-mula equals zero in the determination of GILTI. 
where is the U.S. shareholder’s pro rata amount of the tested income of a CFC and is the aggregate amount of the U.S. share-holder’s pro rata amount of the tested in-come of each CFC with respect to which it is a U.S. shareholder. For purposes of the GILTI inclusion, a per-son is treated as a U.S. shareholder of a CFC for any taxable year only if such person owns (within the meaning of section 958(a)) stock in the corporation on the last day, in such year, on which the corporation is a CFC. A corporation is generally treated as a CFC for any taxable year if the corporation is a CFC at any time during the taxable year. Deemed-paid credit for taxes properly attrib-utable to tested income For any amount of GILTI included in the gross income of a domestic corporation, the corporation’s deemed-paid credit equals 80 percent of the product of the corporation’s inclusion percentage multiplied by the ag-gregate tested foreign income taxes paid or accrued, with respect to tested income, by each CFC with respect to which the domestic corporation is a U.S. shareholder. The inclusion percentage means, with re-spect to any domestic corporation, the ratio (expressed as a percentage) of such corpora-tion’s GILTI amount divided by the aggre-gate amount of its pro rata share of the test-ed income of each CFC with respect to which it is a U.S. shareholder (referred to as ‘‘ag-gregate tested income’’ in the formulas below). Tested foreign income taxes means, with respect to any domestic corporation that is a U.S. shareholder of a CFC, the for-eign income taxes paid or accrued by the CFC that are properly attributable to the CFC’s tested income.
1538 The deemed-paid credit with respect to the GILTI inclusion can be expressed in the fol-lowing formula: 
The provision creates a separate foreign tax credit basket for GILTI, with no carryforward or carryback available for ex-cess credits. For purposes of determining the foreign tax credit limitation, GILTI is not general category income, and income that is both GILTI and passive category income is considered passive category income. As de-scribed in section 14301 of the Senate amend-ment and new section 78, the taxes deemed to have been paid are treated as an increase in GILTI for purposes of section 78, deter-mined by taking into account 100 percent of the product of the inclusion percentage and aggregate tested foreign income taxes (in-stead of 80 percent in the determination of the deemed-paid credit). Therefore, the sec-tion 78 gross-up can be expressed in the fol-lowing formula: 
Effective date.—The provision is effective for taxable years of foreign corporations be-ginning after December 31, 2017, and for tax-able years of U.S. shareholders in which or with which such taxable years of foreign cor-porations end. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the Sen-ate amendment provision, with clarifications and modifications that include the following. Net deemed tangible income return The conference agreement modifies, along lines similar to an approach taken in the House bill provision, the calculation of net deemed tangible income return for purposes of determining GILTI. Net deemed tangible income return is, with respect to any U.S. shareholder for a taxable year, the excess (if any) of 10 percent of the aggregate of its pro rata share of the QBAI of each CFC with re-spect to which it is a U.S. shareholder over the amount of interest expense taken into account in determining its net CFC tested income for the taxable year to the extent that the interest expense exceeds the inter-est income properly allocable to the interest expense that is taken into account in deter-mining its net CFC tested income. As a re-sult, the formula for GILTI in the conference agreement is generally:
1539 GILTI = Net CFC Tested Income—[(10% × QBAI)—Interest Expense] where Interest Expense is defined and limited in the manner described above. Computation of tested income and tested loss For purposes of computing deductions (in-cluding taxes) properly allocable to gross in-come included in tested income or tested loss with respect to a CFC, the deductions are allocated to such gross income following rules similar to the rules of section 954(b)(5) (or to which such deductions would be allo-cable if there were such gross income). Calculation of pro rata shares For purposes of determining pro rata shares in the computation of a U.S. share-holder’s GILTI amount, a person is treated as a U.S. shareholder of a CFC for any tax-able year of such person only if the person owns (within the meaning of section 958(a)) stock in the foreign corporation on the last day in the taxable year of the foreign cor-poration on which the foreign corporation is a CFC. Qualified business asset investment For purposes of determining a CFC’s QBAI and its adjusted basis in specified tangible property, the adjusted basis is determined by allocating the depreciation deduction with respect to the property ratably to each day during the period in the taxable year to which the depreciation relates. In addition, if a CFC holds an interest in a partnership at the close of the CFC’s taxable year, the CFC takes into account its distributive share of the aggregate of the partnership’s adjusted bases (determined as of such date in the hands of the partnership) in tangible prop-erty held by the partnership to the extent that the property is used in the trade or business of the partnership, is of a type with respect to which a deduction is allowable under section 167, and is used in the produc-tion of tested income (determined with re-spect to the CFC’s distributive share of in-come with respect to the property). The CFC’s distributive share of the adjusted basis of any property is the CFC’s distributive share of income with respect to the property. Regulatory authority to address abuse The conferees intend that non-economic transactions intended to affect tax at-tributes of CFCs and their U.S. shareholders (including amounts of tested income and tested loss, tested foreign income taxes, net deemed tangible income return, and QBAI) to minimize tax under this provision be dis-regarded. For example, the conferees expect the Secretary to prescribe regulations to ad-dress transactions that occur after the meas-urement date of post-1986 earnings and prof-its under amended section 965, but before the first taxable year for which new section 951A applies, if such transactions are undertaken to increase a CFC’s QBAI. Effective date.—The provision is effective for taxable years of foreign corporations be-ginning after December 31, 2017, and for tax-able years of U.S. shareholders in which or with which such taxable years of foreign cor-porations end. 9. Limitation on deduction of interest by do-mestic corporations which are members of an international group (sec. 4302 of the House bill, sec. 14221 of the Senate amendment, and new sec. 163(n) of the Code) HOUSE BILL  The provision limits the amount of U.S. in-terest expense that a domestic corporation which is a member of an international finan-cial reporting group can deduct to the sum of the member’s interest income plus the allow-able percentage of 110 percent of net interest expense.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH10122 December 15, 2017 
1540The International Financial Reporting Stand-ards are a set of accounting standards commonly used for the preparation of financial statements of public companies listed in countries outside the United States. 
1541The Secretary is provided is regulatory author-ity to provide for adjustments in determining the amount of net interest expense. at any time during the group’s reporting year, (2) prepares consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. Gen-erally Accepted Accounting Principles (‘‘GAAP’’), International Financial Report-ing Standards (‘‘IFRS’’), or any other com-parable method identified by the Sec-retary,
1540and (3) reports in such statements average annual gross receipts in excess of $100,000,000 (determined in the aggregate with respect to all entities which are part of such group) for the three-reporting-year pe-riod ending with such reporting year. The allowable percentage is the ratio of a corporation’s allocable share of the inter-national financial reporting group’s net in-terest expense over such corporation’s re-ported net interest expense. A corporation’s allocable share of an international financial reporting group’s net interest expense is de-termined based on the corporation’s share of the group’s earnings (computed by adding back net interest expense, taxes, deprecia-tion, and amortization) as reflected in the group’s consolidated financial statements. A corporation’s reported net interest expense is its net interest expense reported in the books and records used to prepare the group’s consolidated financial statements. For international financial reporting groups that do not prepare consolidated financial statements under U.S. GAAP, IFRS, or any other comparable method identified by the Secretary and which are filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Com-mission, the provision provides a hierarchy of other audited consolidated financial state-ments that may be relied upon by such group. The provision applies to partnerships at the partnership level under rules similar to the rules of section 3301 of the bill. The pro-vision also applies to foreign corporations engaged in a U.S. trade or business. A U.S. consolidated group is considered a single cor-poration under this provision. The amount of any interest not allowed as a deduction for any taxable year by reason of this provision or section 3301 of the bill (de-pending on whichever imposes the lower lim-itation for the amount allowed as an interest deduction with respect to such taxable year) can be carried forward as interest (and as business interest for purposes of section 3301 of the bill) for up to five years. The following example illustrates the co-ordination of this provision with section 3301 of the bill in a context involving a partner-ship. Example FP, a foreign corporation, wholly owns USS, a domestic corporation. FP and USS each own 50 percent of PS, a partnership. FP, USS, and PS prepare audited consolidated fi-nancial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP that are used for internal manage-ment purposes and under which average an-nual gross receipts for the 3-reporting-year period ending with the current reporting year in excess of $100 million are reported. During the current reporting year, the FP– USS–PS group has consolidated EBITDA of 300 and consolidated interest expense of 50. During that period, USS has EBITDA of 50 (determined without regard to distributions from PS), reported interest expense of 25, business interest of 30, and adjusted taxable income (determined without regard to USS’s distributive share of PS’s non-separately stated taxable income or loss) of 40. Also during that period, PS has EBITDA of 150, reported interest expense of 15, business in-terest of 20, and adjusted taxable income of 120. PS’s business interest is deductible only to the extent it does not exceed the limitations in each of section 163(j) (as provided in sec-tion 3301 of the bill) and section 163(n) (as provided in section 4302 of the bill). PS’s lim-itation under section 163(j) is 36, which equals 30 percent of its adjusted taxable in-come of 120 (i.e., 30% 120 = 36). PS’s limita-tion under section 163(n) is 22, which equals the allowable percentage (i.e., 160% = 50 × 150 / 300 / 15, not greater than 100%) of 110 per-cent of PS’s business interest (i.e., 22 = 110% × 20). Therefore, all 20 of PS’s business inter-est is deductible. PS’s excess amount under section 163(j) (i.e., 36 ¥ 20 = 16) and excess EBITDA under section 163(n) (i.e., 150 ¥ 300 × 15 / 50 = 60) flow through to its partners. Similarly, USS’s business interest is de-ductible only to the extent it does not exceed the limitations in each of section 163(j) and section 163(n). USS’s limitation under sec-tion 163(j) is 20, which equals 30 percent of the sum of its adjustable taxable income of 40 (determined without regard to USS’s dis-tributive share of PS’s non-separately stated taxable income or loss) or 12 (i.e., 30% × 40 = 12) plus USS’s distributive share of PS’s ex-cess amount under section 163(j)(3)(B) ( i.e., 50% × 16 = 8). USS’s limitation under section 163(n) is 17.60, which equals the allowable percentage (i.e., 53% = 50 × (50 + 30) / 300 / 25) of 110 percent of USS’s business interest ( i.e., 33 = 110% × 30) after taking into account USS’s distributive share of PS’s excess EBITDA under section 163(n) (i.e., 50% × 60 = 30). Therefore, USS may deduct 17.60 of its 30 of business interest in the current year. Effective date.—The provision is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  For any domestic corporation that is a member of a worldwide affiliated group (hereinafter referred to as the ‘‘U.S. cor-porate members’’), the provision reduces the deduction for interest paid or accrued by the corporation by the product of the net inter-est expense of the domestic corporation mul-tiplied by the debt-to-equity differential per-centage of the worldwide affiliated group. Net interest expense means the excess (if any) of: (1) interest paid or accrued by the taxpayer during the taxable year, over (2) the amount of interest includible in the gross income of the taxpayer for the taxable year.
1541 A worldwide affiliated group is one or more chains of corporations, connected through stock ownership with a common parent that would qualify as an affiliated group under section 1504(a), with two differences. First, the ownership threshold of section 1504(a)(2) is applied using 50 percent rather than 80 percent. Second, the restrictions on inclu-sion described in sections 1504(b)(2), (b)(3) and (b)(4) are disregarded for purposes of identifying the worldwide affiliated group. The debt-to-equity differential percentage means, with respect to any worldwide affili-ated group, the excess domestic indebtedness of the group divided by the total indebted-ness of the domestic corporations that are members of the group. All U.S. corporate members of the worldwide affiliated group are treated as one member when determining whether the group has excess domestic in-debtedness as a result of a debt-to-equity dif-ferential. Excess domestic indebtedness is the amount by which the total indebtedness of the U.S. corporate members exceeds 110 percent of the total indebtedness those mem-bers would hold if their total indebtedness to total equity ratio equaled the ratio of total indebtedness to total equity for the world-wide affiliated group. Total equity means, with respect to one or more corporations, the excess (if any) of: (1) the money and all other assets of such corporations, over (2) the total indebtedness of such corporations. For purposes of this computation, intragroup debt and equity interests are disregarded, and assets of the U.S. corporate members of the worldwide affiliated group exclude any interest held by any U.S. corporate member in any foreign corporation that is a member of the group. The amount of any interest not allowed as a deduction for any taxable year by reason of this provision or new section 163(j) (depend-ing on whichever imposes the lower limita-tion with respect to such taxable year) can be carried forward indefinitely. The Secretary is provided regulatory au-thority to provide rules for: (1) the preven-tion of the avoidance of this provision, (2) adjustments in the case of corporations which are members of an affiliated group as may be appropriate to carry out the purposes of the provision, (3) the coordination of this provision with section 884, (4) the treatment of partnership indebtedness, allocation of partnership debt, interest, or distributive shares, and (5) the coordination of this provi-sion with new section 163(j). Effective date.—The provision is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017.

Base erosion using deductible cross-border payments between affiliated companies (sec. 4303 of the House bill and new secs. 4491 and 6038E of the Code; sec. 14401 of the Senate amendment and secs. 6038A and 6038C and new secs. 59A and 59B of the Code) 
HOUSE BILL  In general This provision imposes an excise tax on certain amounts paid by U.S. payors to cer-tain related foreign recipients to the extent the amounts are deductible by the U.S. payor. However, the excise tax does not apply if the foreign recipient elects to be subject to U.S. income tax on the amounts received. In calculating the U.S. income tax liability imposed under such an election, deemed expenses are allowed as a deduction. A foreign tax credit of 80% of applicable for-eign credits are allowed against the U.S. tax liability imposed by this provision if an elec-tion is made. Excise tax The provision provides for an excise tax on specified amounts paid or incurred by a do-mestic corporation to a foreign corporation if both the foreign and domestic corporations are members of the same international fi-nancial reporting group. The amount of the tax is equal to 20 percent of the specified amounts paid or incurred. The excise tax is not imposed with respect to amounts that are or are deemed to be effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business of the foreign corporation. The excise tax imposed is nei-ther deductible nor creditable. A specified amount is any amount which is allowable by the payor as a deduction or in-cludible in costs of goods sold, or inventory, or in the basis of an amortizable or depre-ciable asset. A specified amount does not in-clude: (i) interest, (ii) an amount paid or in-curred for the acquisition of a security de-fined in section 475(c)(2) (without regard to

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H10123 December 15, 2017 
1542This term is defined in new section 163(n)(4) as a financial statement certified as being prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting prin-ciples, international financial reporting standards, or any other comparable method of accounting iden-tified by the Secretary of the Treasury and which is: (i) a 10–K (or successor form), or annual statement to shareholders required to be filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, or, if this is not available, (ii) an audited financial state-ment used for (1) credit purposes, (2) reporting to shareholders, partners or other proprietors, or to beneficiaries, or (3) any other substantial nontax purpose, or, if (i) and (ii) are not available, (iii) filed with any other Federal or State agency for nontax purposes, or, if (i), (ii), or (iii) are not available, a fi-nancial statement used for a purpose described in (ii)(1), (2) and (3), or filed with any regulatory or governmental body, within or outside the United States, specified by the Secretary of the Treasury. the last sentence thereof) or a commodity defined in sections 475(e)(2), that is, a com-modity actively traded within the meaning of section 1092(d)(1) or an identified hedge of such commodity, or, (iii) for a payor which has elected to use a services cost method under section 482, an amount paid or in-curred for services if such amount is the total services cost with no markup. An international financial reporting group is any group of entities that prepares con-solidated financial statements
1542if the av- erage annual aggregate payment amount for the group for the three-year period ending in the reporting year exceeds $100,000,000. The annual aggregate payment amount means the aggregate of the specified amounts made by U.S. members of the group to foreign members of the group during the reporting year. Partnerships and branches For purposes of this provision, a partner-ship is treated as an aggregate of its part-ners. Accordingly, a payment made to a partnership is treated as a payment to the partners, and a payment from a partnership is treated as a payment from the partners, in an amount equal to the partner’s distribu-tive share of the relevant item of income, gain, deduction, or loss. For purposes of this provision, U.S. branches are treated as separate entities for purposes of determining the treatment of payments between a branch and entities other than its owner and for purposes of deemed payments between a branch and its owner. Election to treat payments as effectively con-nected income If a specified amount is paid or incurred by a domestic corporation with respect to a for-eign corporation and both the foreign and domestic corporations are members of the same international financial reporting group, the foreign corporation may elect to take into account all such specified amounts as if the foreign corporation were engaged in a U.S. trade or business and had a permanent establishment and as if the payment were ef-fectively connected with that U.S. trade or business and were attributable to the perma-nent establishment, irrespective of any oth-erwise applicable treaty. If the foreign cor-poration makes such election, the excise tax is not imposed and tax is imposed on a net basis on such specified amounts less deemed expenses. The election applies for the tax-able year for which the election is made and all subsequent taxable years unless revoked with consent of the Secretary of the Treas-ury. In general, the amount treated as effec-tively connected income under this provision is treated as such for all purposes of the Code. For example, it is subject to the branch profit tax (unless otherwise reduced, such as by an applicable treaty) and is not subject to the excise tax under section 4371. However, for purposes of section 245 and new section 245A, these amounts are not treated as effectively connected income. Therefore, a distribution of earnings attributable to the amounts described in this provision is eligi-ble for the participation DRD under new sec-tion 245A. The deemed expenses with respect to any specified amount received by a foreign cor-poration during any reporting year is the amount of expenses such that the net income ratio of the foreign corporation with respect to the specified amount (taking into account only such specified amounts and such deemed expenses) is equal to the net income ratio of the international financial reporting group determined for the reporting year with respect to the product line to which the spec-ified amount relates. The net income ratio is the ratio of net income determined without regard to income taxes, interest income, and interest expense, divided by revenue. The net income ratio is calculated in accordance with the books and records used in preparing the group’s consolidated financial state-ments. The net income ratio is determined by taking into account only revenues and ex-penses of the foreign members of the inter-national financial reporting group (other than the members of the group that are or are treated as domestic corporations for pur-poses of the provision) derived from, or in-curred with respect to, persons that are not members of the group or members of the group that are or are treated as domestic corporations for purposes of the provision. The following example illustrates the de-termination of a foreign affiliate’s deemed expenses under the provision: According to the books and records (after taking into account intercompany trans-actions otherwise eliminated in consolida-tion) of an international financial reporting group consisting of US, FS1, and FS2, a do-mestic corporation, US has third-party reve-nues of $1000, incurs third-party expenses of $500, and makes a $300 payment for intercom-pany services to its foreign affiliate, FS1. FS1 has revenues of $500 ($200 of which are third-party) and incurs third-party expenses of $250. US’s other foreign affiliate, FS2, has $300 of revenues, incurs $150 of third-party expenses, and makes a $100 intercompany payment to US. US’s entire payment to FS1 is deductible for Federal income tax pur-poses, and FS1 elects to treat the $300 amount as subject to section 882(g)(1). On a consolidated basis, the US–FS1–FS2 group has revenues of $1500 and incurs third-party expenses of $900. To determine the foreign affiliate’s deemed expenses, its foreign profit margin will be de-termined by reference to ratio of the foreign earnings before interest and taxes (‘‘EBIT’’) against the foreign revenues, with adjust-ments for related party inbound and out-bound payments. In other words, the foreign affiliate’s profit margin can be determined as follows: (GEBIT ¥ USEBIT + RPOP ¥ RPIP) ÷ (GREV ¥ USREV + RPOP) GEBIT is global EBIT (determined on a consolidated basis), USEBIT is the domestic corporation’s EBIT (without regard to re-lated party transactions), RPOP is the group’s related party outbound payments made from domestic corporations to foreign affiliates, and RPIP is the group’s related party inbound payments made from foreign affiliates to domestic corporations. In the denominator, GREV is global reve-nues (determined on a consolidated basis) and USREV is the domestic corporation’s revenues (without regard to related party transactions). Under the aforementioned facts, the for-eign affiliate’s profit margin would be 37.5%, or (600 ¥ 500 + 300 ¥ 100) ÷ (1500 ¥ 1000 + 300) Accordingly, of the $300 payment from US to FS1, $112.50 would be deemed to be income effectively connected to a US trade or busi-ness, and subject to corporate tax. The re-maining $187.50 of the payment would be deemed expenses for which FSI would be al-lowed a deduction. Coordination with FDAP Amounts treated as effectively connected income under this provision are not excluded from the definition of fixed or determinable annual or periodical (‘‘FDAP’’) income. Pay-ments subject to tax under section 881 do not constitute specified payments under this provision except to the extent that the rate of tax imposed under section 881 is reduced by a bilateral income tax treaty. Joint and several liability If there is an underpayment with respect to any taxable year of an electing foreign corporation which is a member of an inter-national financial accounting group, each domestic corporation in the group is jointly and severally liable for as much of the under-payment as does not exceed the excess of such underpayment over the amount of such underpayment determined without regard to this rule and any penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount attributable to the above amount. Foreign tax credit The foreign tax credit allowed under sec-tion 906(a) with respect to amounts taken into account as effectively connected income is limited to 80 percent of the amount of taxes paid or accrued (and determined with-out regard to section 906(b)(1)). These foreign tax credits are effectively separately basketed and may not be carried backwards or forwards. Reporting An electing foreign corporation that re-ceives a specified amount is required to re-port, with respect to each member of the international financial reporting group from which any such amount is received: (i) the name and taxpayer identification number of each member, (ii) the aggregate amounts re-ceived from each member, (iii) the product lines to which such amounts relate, the ag-gregate amounts relating to each product line, and the net income ratio for each prod-uct line, and (iv) a summary of changes in fi-nancial accounting methods that affect the computation of any net income ratio de-scribed above. A domestic corporation that pays or ac-crues a specified amount with respect to which a foreign corporation has made the election is required to make a return accord-ing to the forms and regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury containing certain information and to maintain suffi-cient records to determine the tax liability imposed by this provision. The information required to be provided is as follows: (1) the name and taxpayer identification number of the common parent of the international fi-nancial reporting group of which the domes-tic corporation is a member, and (2) with re-spect to a specified amount: (A) the name and taxpayer identification number of the recipient of the amount, (B) the aggregate amounts received by the recipient, (C) the product lines to which the amounts relate and the aggregate amounts for each product line, and the net income ratio for each prod-uct line, and (D) a summary of any changes in financial accounting methods that affect the computation of any net income ratio de-scribed in (C). Treasury may prescribe regulations or other guidance that address reporting re-quirements of foreign affiliates under this provision, such as allowing reporting or elec-tions on a group basis.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH10124 December 15, 2017 
1543In the case of an applicable taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group (defined in section 1504(a)(1)) that includes a bank as defined in section 581 or a registered securities dealer defined in sec-tion 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the rates are 11 percent instead of the abovementioned 10 percent and 13.5 percent instead of the abovementioned 12.5 percent. 
1544Described in Treas. Reg. sec. 1.482–9(b). 1545As in effect before the date of enactment of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. 1546Section 15006 of the bill (and new section 6050Z) establishes certain reporting requirements. These reporting requirements are effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024, and con-tinue to be required regardless of whether the rev-enue requirement is met. Any taxpayer who makes a payment to a foreign person who is a related party (as such term is defined in section 14401 of the bill and new section 59A) of the taxpayer during the tax-able year is required to make a return, according to forms and regulations prescribed by the Secretary, setting forth (1) the amount of such payments by type and separately stated and (2) any amount paid Effective date.—The provisions of this sec-tion apply to amounts paid or incurred after December 31, 2018. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  In general Under the provision, an applicable tax-payer is required to pay a tax equal to the base erosion minimum tax amount for the taxable year. The base erosion minimum tax amount is the excess of 10 percent of the modified taxable income of the taxpayer for the taxable year over an amount equal to the regular tax liability (defined in section 26(b)) of the taxpayer for the taxable year reduced (but not below zero) by the excess of an amount equal to the credits allowed under Chapter 1 less the credit allowed under sec-tion 38 (general business credits) for the tax-able year allocable to the research credit under section 41(a). For taxable years begin-ning after December 31, 2025, two changes are made, (A) the 10-percent provided for above is changed to 12.5-percent, and (B) the reg-ular tax liability is reduced by the aggregate amount of the credits allowed under Chapter 1 (and no other adjustment is made).
1543 To determine its modified taxable income, the applicable taxpayer computes its taxable income for the year without regard to any base erosion tax benefit of a base erosion payment or base erosion percentage of any allowable net operating loss deduction. Base erosion payments A base erosion payment generally includes any amount paid or accrued by a taxpayer to a foreign person that is a related party of the taxpayer and with respect to which a deduc-tion is allowable under Chapter 1. Such pay-ments also include any amount paid or ac-crued by the taxpayer to the related party in connection with the acquisition by the tax-payer from the related party of property of a character subject to the allowance of depre-ciation (or amortization in lieu of deprecia-tion). Base erosion payments do not include pay-ments for cost of goods sold (which is not a deduction but rather a reduction to income). A base erosion payment includes any amount that constitutes reductions in gross receipts of the taxpayer that is paid or accrued by the taxpayer with respect to: (1) a surrogate foreign corporation which is a related party of the taxpayer, but only if such person first became a surrogate foreign corporation after November 9, 2017, or (2) a foreign person that is a member of the same expanded affiliated group as the surrogate foreign corporation. A surrogate foreign corporation has the meaning given in section 7874(a)(2), but does not include a foreign corporation treated as a domestic corporation under section 7874(b). A base erosion payment does not apply to any amount paid or accrued by a taxpayer for services if such services meet the require-ments for eligibility for use of the services cost method under section 482,
1544determined without regard to the requirement that the services not contribute significantly to fun-damental risks of business success or failure and such amount constitutes the total serv-ices cost with no markup. Any qualified derivative payment is not treated as a base erosion payment. A quali-fied derivative payment means any payment made by a taxpayer pursuant to a derivative with respect to which the taxpayer: (i) recog-nizes gain or loss as if such derivative were sold for its fair market value on the last business day of the taxable year (and such additional times as are required by this title or the taxpayer’s method of accounting), (ii) treats any gain or loss so recognized as ordi-nary, and (iii) treats the character of all items of income, deduction, gain or loss with respect to a payment pursuant to the deriva-tive as ordinary. No payment is treated as a qualified deriv-ative payment unless the taxpayer includes in the information required to be reported under section 6038B(b)(2) with respect to such taxable year such information as is nec-essary to identify the payments to be so treated and such other information as the Secretary of the Treasury determines nec-essary to carry out the provision. The rule for qualified derivative payments does not apply if such payment would be treated as a base erosion payment if it were not made pursuant to a derivative, including any interest, royalty, or service payment, or in the case of a contract which has deriva-tive and nonderivative components, the pay-ment is properly allocable to the nonderiva-tive component. For these purposes, the term derivative means any contract (including any option, forward contract, futures contract, short po-sition, swap, or similar contract) the value of which, or any payment or other transfer with respect to which, is (directly or indi-rectly) determined by reference to one or more of the following: (i) any share of stock of a corporation, (ii) any evidence of indebt-edness, (iii) any commodity which is actively traded, (iv) any currency, (v) any rate, price, amount, index, formula, or algorithm. Ex-cept as otherwise provided by the Secretary of the Treasury, American depository re-ceipts and similar instruments with respect to shares of stock in foreign corporations are treated as shares of stock in such foreign corporations. A base erosion tax benefit means: (i) any deduction allowed under Chapter 1 for the taxable year with respect to a base erosion payment, (ii) in the case of a base erosion payment with respect to the purchase of property of a character subject to the allow-ance for depreciation (or amortization in lieu of depreciation), any deduction allowed in Chapter 1 for depreciation or amortization in lieu of depreciation with respect to the property acquired with such payment, or (iii) any reduction in gross receipts with respect to a payment described above with respect to a surrogate foreign corporation (as defined there) in computing gross income of the tax-payer for the taxable year. Any base erosion tax benefit attributable to any base erosion payment on which tax is imposed by sections 871 or 881 and with re-spect to which tax has been deducted and withheld under sections 1441 or 1442, is not taken into account in computing modified taxable income as defined above. The amount not taken into account in computing modified taxable income is reduced under rules similar to the rules under section 163(j)(5)(B).
1545 The base erosion percentage means for any taxable year, the percentage determined by dividing the aggregate amount of base ero-sion tax benefits of the taxpayer for the tax-able year by the aggregate amount of the de-ductions allowable to the taxpayer under Chapter 1 for the taxable year, taking into account base erosion tax benefits described above and by not taking into account any deduction allowed under sections 172, 245A or 250 for the taxable year. Applicable taxpayers and related parties Applicable taxpayer means with respect to any taxable year, a taxpayer: (A) which is a corporation other than a regulated invest-ment company, a real estate investment trust, or an S corporation; (B) the average annual gross receipts of the corporation for the three-taxable-year period ending with the preceding taxable year are at least $500 million, and (C) the base erosion percentage (as defined above) of the corporation for the taxable year is four percent or higher. In the case of a foreign person the gross re-ceipts of which are taken into account for purposes of this provision, only gross re-ceipts which are taken into account in deter-mining income effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States is taken into account. If a for-eign person’s gross receipts are aggregated with a U.S. person’s gross receipts for rea-sons described in the aggregation rules below, the preceding sentence does not apply to the gross receipts of any U.S. person which are aggregated with the taxpayer’s gross receipts. All persons treated as a single employer under section 52(a) are treated as one person for purposes of this provision, except that in applying section 1563 for purposes of section 52, the exception for foreign corporations under section 1563(b)(2)(C) is disregarded (called the ‘‘aggregation rules’’). For purposes of this provision, foreign per-son has the meaning given in section 6038A(c)(3). Related party means: (i) any 25-percent owner of the taxpayer, (ii) any person who is related to the taxpayer or any 25-percent owner of the taxpayer, within the meaning of sections 267(b) or 707(b)(1), and (iii) any other person related to the taxpayer within the meaning of section 482. For these purposes, section 318 regarding constructive ownership of stock applies to these related party rules except that 10-percent is substituted for 50- percent in section 318(a)(2)(C), and for these purposes section 318(a)(3)(A), (B) and (C) do not cause a United States person to own stock owned by a person who is not a United States person. The provision provides that the Secretary of the Treasury is to prescribe such regula-tions or other guidance necessary or appro-priate, including regulations providing for such adjustments to the application of this section necessary to prevent avoidance of the provision, including through: (1) the use of unrelated persons, conduit transactions, or other intermediaries, or (2) transactions or arrangements designed in whole or in part: (A) to characterize payments otherwise subject to this provision as payments not subject to this provision, or (B) to substitute payments not subject to this provision for payments otherwise subject to this provi-sion. Information reporting requirements1546 The provision authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to prescribe additional report-ing requirements under section 6038A relat-ing to: (A) the name, principal place of busi-ness, and country or countries in which orga-nized or resident of each person which: (i) is

In addition, for purposes of information re-porting under sections 6038A and 6038C, if the reporting corporation or the foreign corpora-tion to which section 6038C applies is an ap-plicable taxpayer under this provision, the information that may be required includes: (A) base erosion payments paid or accrued during the taxable year by the taxpayer to a foreign person which is a related party of the taxpayer, (B) such information as the Sec-retary of the Treasury finds necessary to de-termine the base erosion minimum amount of the taxpayer for the taxable year, and (C) such other information as the Secretary of the Treasury determines is necessary. The penalties provided for under sections 6038A(D)(1) and (2) are both increased to $25,000. Effective date.—The provision applies to base erosion payments paid or accrued in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The provision in the conference agreement follows the Senate amendment with some changes, as follows. In general Under the provision, an applicable tax-payer is required to pay a tax equal to the base erosion minimum tax amount for the taxable year. The base erosion minimum tax amount is the excess of 10 percent
1547of the modified taxable income of the taxpayer for the taxable year over an amount equal to the regular tax liability (defined in section 26(b)) of the taxpayer for the taxable year reduced (but not below zero) by the excess (if any) of the credits allowed under Chapter 1 against such regular tax liability over the sum of: (1) the credit allowed under section 38 for the taxable year which is properly allocable to the research credit determined under section 41(a), plus (2) the portion of the applicable section 38 credits not in excess of 80 percent of the lesser of the amount of such credits or the base erosion minimum tax amount (de-termined without regard to this clause (2)). For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025, two changes are made, (A) the 10- percent provided for above is changed to 12.5- percent, and (B) the regular tax liability is reduced by the aggregate amount of the credits allowed under Chapter 1 (and no other adjustment is made).
1548 Applicable section 38 credits means the credit allowed under section 38 for the tax-able year which is properly allocable to: (A) the low-income housing credit determined under section 42(a), (B) the renewable elec-tricity production credit determined under section 45(a), and (C) the investment credit determined under section 46, but only to the extent properly allocable to the energy cred-it determined under section 48. To determine its modified taxable income, the applicable taxpayer computes its taxable income for the year without regard to any base erosion tax benefit with respect to any base erosion payment or the base erosion percentage of any allowable net operating loss deduction allowed under section 172 for the taxable year. Base erosion payments A base erosion payment means any amount paid or accrued by a taxpayer to a foreign person that is a related party of the taxpayer and with respect to which a deduction is al-lowable under Chapter 1. Such payments in-clude any amount paid or accrued by the taxpayer to the related party in connection with the acquisition by the taxpayer from the related party of property of a character subject to the allowance of depreciation (or amortization in lieu of depreciation). A base erosion payment includes any premium or other consideration paid or accrued by the taxpayer to a foreign person which is a re-lated party of the taxpayer for any reinsur-ance payments taken into account under sec-tions 803(a)(1)(B) or 832(b)(4)(A). Base erosion payments do not include any amount that constitutes reductions in gross receipts including payments for costs of goods sold. However, base erosion payment includes any amount that constitutes reduc-tions in gross receipts of the taxpayer that is paid or accrued by the taxpayer with respect to: (1) a surrogate foreign corporation which is a related party of the taxpayer, but only if such person first became a surrogate foreign corporation after November 9, 2017, or (2) a foreign person that is a member of the same expanded affiliated group as the surrogate foreign corporation. A surrogate foreign cor-poration has the meaning given in section 7874(a)(2), but does not include a foreign cor-poration treated as a domestic corporation under section 7874(b). A base erosion payment does not include any amount paid or accrued by a taxpayer for services if such services meet the require-ments for eligibility for use of the services cost method described in Treas. Reg. sec. 1.482–9, as in effect as of the date of enact-ment of TCJA, without regard to the re-quirement that the services not contribute significantly to fundamental risks of busi-ness success or failure and only if the pay-ments are made for services that have no markup component. Any qualified derivative payment is not treated as a base erosion payment. A quali-fied derivative payment means any payment made by a taxpayer pursuant to a derivative with respect to which the taxpayer: (i) recog-nizes gain or loss as if such derivative were sold for its fair market value on the last business day of the taxable year (and such additional times as are required by this title or the taxpayer’s method of accounting), (ii) treats any gain or loss so recognized as ordi-nary, and (iii) treats the character of all items of income, deduction, gain or loss with respect to a payment pursuant to the deriva-tive as ordinary. No payment is treated as a qualified deriv-ative payment unless the taxpayer includes in the information required to be reported under section 6038B(b)(2) with respect to such taxable year such information as is nec-essary to identify the payments to be so treated and such other information as the Secretary of the Treasury determines nec-essary to carry out the provision. The rule for qualified derivative payments does not apply if a payment with respect to a derivative is in substance, or is disguising, the kind of payment that would be treated as a base erosion payment if it were not made pursuant to a derivative, including any in-terest, royalty, or service payment, (or any other payment subject to this provision) or in the case of a contract which has deriva-tive and nonderivative components, the pay-ment is properly allocable to the nonderiva-tive component. For these purposes, the term derivative means any contract (including any option, forward contract, futures contract, short po-sition, swap, or similar contract) the value of which, or any payment or other transfer with respect to which, is (directly or indi-rectly) determined by reference to one or more of the following: (i) any share of stock of a corporation, (ii) any evidence of indebt-edness, (iii) any commodity which is actively traded, (iv) any currency, (v) any rate, price, amount, index, formula, or algorithm. Ex-cept as otherwise provided by the Secretary of the Treasury, American depository re-ceipts and similar instruments with respect to shares of stock in foreign corporations are treated as shares of stock in such foreign corporations. The term derivative does not include any item described in paragraphs (i) through (v) above nor shall the term ‘deriva-tive’ include any insurance, annuity, or en-dowment contract issued by an insurance company to which subchapter L applies (or issued by any foreign corporation to which such subchapter would apply if such foreign corporation were a domestic corporation). A base erosion tax benefit means: (i) any deduction allowed under Chapter 1 for the taxable year with respect to a base erosion payment, (ii) in the case of a base erosion payment with respect to the purchase of property of a character subject to the allow-ance for depreciation (or amortization in lieu of depreciation), any deduction allowed in Chapter 1 for depreciation or amortization in lieu of depreciation with respect to the property acquired with such payment, or (iii) any reduction in gross receipts with respect to a payment described above with respect to a surrogate foreign corporation (as defined there) in computing gross income of the tax-payer for the taxable year. Any base erosion tax benefit attributable to any base erosion payment on which tax is imposed by sections 871 or 881 and with re-spect to which tax has been deducted and withheld under sections 1441 or 1442, is not taken into account in computing modified taxable income as defined above. The amount not taken into account in computing modified taxable income is reduced under rules similar to the rules under section 163(j)(5)(B).1549 The base erosion percentage means for any taxable year, the percentage determined by dividing the aggregate amount of base ero-sion tax benefits of the taxpayer for the tax-able year by the aggregate amount of the de-ductions allowable to the taxpayer under Chapter 1 for the taxable year, taking into account base erosion tax benefits described above and by not taking into account any deduction allowed under sections 172, 245A or 250 for the taxable year, any deduction for amounts paid or accrued for services to which the exception for the services cost method (as described above) applies, and any deduction for qualified derivative payments which are not treated as a base erosion pay-ment as described above. Applicable taxpayers and related parties Applicable taxpayer means with respect to any taxable year, a taxpayer: (A) which is a corporation other than a regulated invest-ment company, a real estate investment trust, or an S corporation; (B) the average annual gross receipts of the corporation for the three-taxable-year period ending with the preceding taxable year are at least $500 million, and (C) the base erosion percentage (as defined above) of the corporation for the taxable year is three percent or higher.

1551Section 15006 of the bill (and new section 6050Z) establishes certain reporting requirements. These reporting requirements are effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024, and con-tinue to be required regardless of whether the rev-enue requirement is met. Any taxpayer who makes a payment to a foreign person who is a related party (as such term is defined in section 14401 of the bill and new section 59A) of the taxpayer during the tax-able year is required to make a return, according to forms and regulations prescribed by the Secretary, setting forth (1) the amount of such payments by type and separately stated and (2) any amount paid that results in a reduction of gross receipts to the taxpayer (e.g., cost of goods sold). 1552Veritas v. Commissioner, 133 T.C. No. 14 (Decem-ber 10, 2009), non-acq., IRB 2010–49 (December 6, 2010).

Commis- sioner, 148 T.C. No. 8 (2017) (holding that ‘‘workforce in place, going concern value, goodwill, and what trial witnesses described as ‘growth options’ and corporate ‘resources’ or ‘opportunities’’’ all fell out-side the definition under present law).

Commissioner , 21 T.C. 513 (1954) (thirty-one related patents must be valued as a group and the useful life for depreciation should be based on the average of the patents’ useful lives); Standard Conveyor Co. v. Commissioner , 25 B.T.A. 281, p. 283 (1932) (‘‘[I]t is evident that it is impossible to value these seven patents separately.

Commissioner, 59 T.C. 220 (1972) (taxpayer who abandoned a distribution network of contracts with separate distributorships was entitled to an aban-donment loss for the entire network in the taxable year during which the last of the contracts was ter-minated because that was the year in which the en-tire intangible value was lost). 
1555See Treas. Reg. sec. 1.482–7(g)(2)(iv) (if multiple transactions in connection with a cost-sharing ar-rangement involve platform, operating and other contributions of resources, capabilities or rights that are reasonably anticipated to be interrelated, then determination of the arm’s-length charge for platform contribution transactions and other trans-actions on an aggregate basis may provide the most reliable measure of an arm’s-length result). In the case of a foreign person the gross re-ceipts of which are taken into account for purposes of this provision, only gross re-ceipts which are taken into account in deter-mining income effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States is taken into account. If a for-eign person’s gross receipts are aggregated with a U.S. person’s gross receipts for rea-sons described in the aggregation rules below, the preceding sentence does not apply to the gross receipts of any U.S. person which are aggregated with the taxpayer’s gross receipts. All persons treated as a single employer under section 52(a) are treated as one person for purposes of this provision, except that in applying section 1563 for purposes of section 52, the exception for foreign corporations under section 1563(b)(2)(C) is disregarded (called the ‘‘aggregation rules’’). For purposes of this provision, foreign per-son has the meaning given in section 6038A(c)(3). Related party means: (i) any 25-percent owner of the taxpayer, (ii) any person who is related to the taxpayer or any 25-percent owner of the taxpayer, within the meaning of sections 267(b) or 707(b)(1), and (iii) any other person related to the taxpayer within the meaning of section 482. For these purposes, section 318 regarding constructive ownership of stock applies to these related party rules except that 10-percent is substituted for 50- percent in section 318(a)(2)(C), and for these purposes section 318(a)(3)(A), (B) and (C) do not cause a United States person to own stock owned by a person who is not a United States person. The provision provides that the Secretary of the Treasury is to prescribe such regula-tions or other guidance necessary or appro-priate, including regulations providing for such adjustments to the application of this section necessary to prevent avoidance of the provision, including through: (1) the use of unrelated persons, conduit transactions, or other intermediaries, or (2) transactions or arrangements designed in whole or in part: (A) to characterize payments otherwise subject to this provision as payments not subject to this provision, or (B) to substitute payments not subject to this provision for payments otherwise subject to this provi-sion. Information reporting requirements
1551 The provision authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to prescribe additional report-ing requirements under section 6038A relat-ing to: (A) the name, principal place of busi-ness, and country or countries in which orga-nized or resident of each person which: (i) is a related party to the reporting corporation, and (ii) had any transaction with the report-ing corporation during its taxable year, (B) the manner of relation between the reporting corporation and the person referred to in (A), and (C) transactions between the reporting corporation and each related foreign person. In addition, for purposes of information re-porting under sections 6038A and 6038C, if the reporting corporation or the foreign corpora-tion to which section 6038C applies is an ap-plicable taxpayer under this provision, the information that may be required includes: (A) base erosion payments paid or accrued during the taxable year by the taxpayer to a foreign person which is a related party of the taxpayer, (B) such information as the Sec-retary of the Treasury finds necessary to de-termine the base erosion minimum amount of the taxpayer for the taxable year, and (C) such other information as the Secretary of the Treasury determines is necessary. The penalties provided for under sections 6038A(D)(1) and (2) are both increased to $25,000. Effective date.—The provision applies to base erosion payments paid or accrued in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 2. Limitations on income shifting through in-tangible property transfers (sec. 14222 of the bill and secs. 367, 482, and 936 of the Code) HOUSE BILL  No provision. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The provision addresses recurring defini-tional and methodological issues that have arisen in controversies
1552in transfers of in-tangible property for purposes of sections 367(d) and 482, both of which use the statu-tory definition of intangible property in sec-tion 936(h)(3)(B). The provision revises that definition and confirms the authority to re-quire certain valuation methods. It does not modify the basic approach of the existing transfer pricing rules with regard to income from intangible property. Under the provision, workforce in place, goodwill (both foreign and domestic), and going concern value are intangible property within the meaning of section 936(h)(3)(B), as is the residual category of ‘‘any similar item’’ the value of which is not attributable to tangible property or the services of an in-dividual. The flush language at the end of that subparagraph is removed, to make clear that the source or amount of value is not rel-evant to whether property that is one of the specified types of intangible property is within the scope of the definition. The provision clarifies the authority of the Secretary to specify the method to be used to determine the value of intangible prop-erty, both with respect to outbound restructurings of U.S. operations and to intercompany pricing allocations,
1553 by amending 482 as well as the grant of regu-latory authority under section 367 regarding the use of aggregate basis valuation and the application of the realistic alternative prin-ciple. With respect to aggregate basis valuation, the provision requires use of that method of valuation in the case of transfers of multiple intangible properties in one or more related transactions if the Secretary determines that an aggregate basis achieves a more reli-able result than an asset-by-asset approach. The provision is consistent with the position that the additional value that results from the interrelation of intangible assets can be properly attributed to the underlying intan-gible assets in the aggregate, where doing so yields a more reliable result. This approach is also consistent with Tax Court decisions in cases outside of the section 482 context, where collections of multiple, related intan-gible assets were viewed by the Tax Court in the aggregate.1554Finally, it is also con-sistent with the cost-sharing regulations.
1555 The provision codifies use of the realistic alternative principles to determine valu-ation with respect to intangible property transactions. The realistic alternative prin-ciple is predicated on the notion that a tax-payer will only enter into a particular trans-action if none of its realistic alternatives is economically preferable to the transaction under consideration. For example, under the existing regulations provide the IRS with the ability to determine an arm’s-length price by reference to a transaction (such as the owner of intangible property using it to make a product itself) that is different from the transaction that was actually completed (such as the owner of that same intangible property licensing the manufacturing rights and then buying the product from the li-censee). Effective date.—The provision applies to transfers in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. No inference is intended with respect to application of section 936(h)(3)(B) or the authority of the Secretary to provide by regulation for such application with respect to taxable years beginning be-fore January 1, 2018.

HOUSE BILL  No provision. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The provision denies a deduction for any disqualified related party amount paid or ac-crued pursuant to a hybrid transaction or by, or to, a hybrid entity. A disqualified related party amount is any interest or royalty paid or accrued to a related party to the extent that: (1) there is no corresponding inclusion to the related party under the tax law of the country of which such related party is a resi-dent for tax purposes or is subject to tax, or (2) such related party is allowed a deduction with respect to such amount under the tax law of such country. A disqualified related party amount does not include any payment to the extent such payment is included in the gross income of a U.S. shareholder under

Extension of deduction allowable with re-spect to income attributable to domestic production activities in Puerto Rico (sec. 4401 of the House bill and sec. 199 of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  In general Present law generally provides a deduction from taxable income (or, in the case of an in-dividual, adjusted gross income) that is equal to nine percent of the lesser of the tax-payer’s qualified production activities in-come or taxable income for the taxable year. For taxpayers subject to the 35-percent cor-porate income tax rate, the nine-percent de-duction effectively reduces the corporate in-come tax rate to slightly less than 32 percent on qualified production activities income. In general, qualified production activities income is equal to domestic production gross receipts reduced by the sum of: (1) the costs of goods sold that are allocable to those re-ceipts; and (2) other expenses, losses, or de-ductions which are properly allocable to those receipts. Domestic production gross receipts gen-erally are gross receipts of a taxpayer that are derived from: (1) any sale, exchange, or other disposition, or any lease, rental, or li-cense, of qualifying production property
1556 that was manufactured, produced, grown or extracted by the taxpayer in whole or in sig-nificant part within the United States; (2) any sale, exchange, or other disposition, or any lease, rental, or license, of qualified film
1557produced by the taxpayer; (3) any lease, rental, license, sale, exchange, or other disposition of electricity, natural gas, or potable water produced by the taxpayer in the United States; (4) construction of real property performed in the United States by a taxpayer in the ordinary course of a con-struction trade or business; or (5) engineer-ing or architectural services performed in the United States for the construction of real property located in the United States. The amount of the deduction for a taxable year is limited to 50 percent of the wages paid by the taxpayer, and properly allocable to domestic production gross receipts, during the calendar year that ends in such taxable year.
1558Wages paid to bona fide residents of Puerto Rico generally are not included in the definition of wages for purposes of com-puting the wage limitation amount.1559 Rules for Puerto Rico When used in the Code in a geographical sense, the term ‘‘United States’’ generally includes only the States and the District of Columbia.
1560A special rule for determining domestic production gross receipts, however, provides that in the case of any taxpayer with gross receipts from sources within the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the term ‘‘United States’’ includes the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, but only if all of the tax-payer’s Puerto Rico-sourced gross receipts are taxable under the Federal income tax for individuals or corporations.
1561In computing the 50-percent wage limitation, the taxpayer is permitted to take into account wages paid to bona fide residents of Puerto Rico for services performed in Puerto Rico.
1562 The special rules for Puerto Rico apply only with respect to the first 11 taxable years of a taxpayer beginning after Decem-ber 31, 2005 and before January 1, 2017. 
HOUSE BILL  The provision extends the special domestic production activities rules for Puerto Rico to apply for the first 12 taxable years of a taxpayer beginning after December 31, 2005 and before January 1, 2018. Effective date.—The provision is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2016. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  No provision. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement does not include the House bill provision. 2. Extension of temporary increase in limit on cover over of rum excise taxes to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands (sec. 4402 of the House bill and sec. 7652(f) of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  A $13.50 per proof gallon
1563excise tax is imposed on distilled spirits produced in or imported into the United States.
1564The ex- cise tax does not apply to distilled spirits that are exported from the United States, in-cluding exports to U.S. possessions (e.g., Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands).
1565 The Code provides for cover over (payment) to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands of the excise tax imposed on rum imported (or brought) into the United States, without re-gard to the country of origin.
1566The amount of the cover over is limited under section 7652(f) to the lesser of (1) $10.50 per proof gal-lon ($13.25 per proof gallon before January 1, 2017) or (2) the excise tax imposed under sec-tion 5001(a)(1) on each proof gallon. Tax amounts attributable to shipments to the United States of rum produced in Puerto Rico are covered over to Puerto Rico. Tax amounts attributable to shipments to the United States of rum produced in the U.S. Virgin Islands are covered over to the U.S. Virgin Islands. Tax amounts attributable to shipments to the United States of rum pro-duced in neither Puerto Rico nor the U.S.

1569For taxable years beginning before January 1, 2006, certain domestic corporations with business op-erations in the U.S. possessions were eligible for the possession tax credit. Secs. 27(b) and 936. This credit offset the U.S. tax imposed on certain income re-lated to operations in the U.S. possessions. Subject to certain limitations, the amount of the possession tax credit allowed to any domestic corporation equaled the portion of that corporation’s U.S. tax that was attributable to the corporation’s non-U.S. source taxable income from (1) the active conduct of a trade or business within a U.S. possession, (2) the sale or exchange of substantially all of the assets that were used in such a trade or business, or (3) cer-tain possessions investment. No deduction or foreign tax credit was allowed for any possessions or foreign tax paid or accrued with respect to taxable income that was taken into account in computing the credit under section 936. Under the economic activity- based limit, the amount of the credit could not ex-ceed an amount equal to the sum of (1) 60 percent of the taxpayer’s qualified possession wages and allo-cable employee fringe benefit expenses, (2) 15 per-cent of depreciation allowances with respect to short-life qualified tangible property, plus 40 percent of depreciation allowances with respect to medium- life qualified tangible property, plus 65 percent of depreciation allowances with respect to long-life qualified tangible property, and (3) in certain cases, a portion of the taxpayer’s possession income taxes. A taxpayer could elect, instead of the economic ac-tivity-based limit, a limit equal to the applicable percentage of the credit that otherwise would have been allowable with respect to possession business income, beginning in 1998, the applicable percentage was 40 percent. 
To qualify for the possession tax credit for a tax-able year, a domestic corporation was required to satisfy two conditions. First, the corporation was required to derive at least 80 percent of its gross in-come for the three-year period immediately pre-ceding the close of the taxable year from sources within a possession. Second, the corporation was re-quired to derive at least 75 percent of its gross in-come for that same period from the active conduct of a possession business. Sec. 936(a)(2). The section 936 credit generally expired for taxable years begin-ning after December 31, 2005. 
1570A corporation will qualify as an existing credit claimant if it acquired all the assets of a trade or business of a corporation that (1) actively conducted that trade or business in a possession on October 13, 1995, and (2) had elected the benefits of the posses-sion tax credit in an election in effect for the tax-able year that included October 13, 1995. 1571Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006, Pub.

Under the provision, the cover-over limita-tion of $13.25 per proof gallon is extended for rum brought into the United States after De-cember 31, 2016 and before January 1, 2023. After December 31, 2022, the cover over amount reverts to $10.50 per proof gallon. Effective date.—The provision applies to distilled spirits brought into the United States after December 31, 2016. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  No provision. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement does not include the House bill provision. 3. Extension of American Samoa economic development credit (sec. 4403 of the House bill and sec. 119 of Pub. L. No. 109– 432) 
PRESENT LAW  A domestic corporation that was an exist-ing credit claimant with respect to American Samoa and that elected the application of section 936 for its last taxable year beginning before January 1, 2006 is allowed a credit based on the corporation’s economic activ-ity-based limitation with respect to Amer-ican Samoa. The credit is not part of the Code but is computed based on the rules of sections 30A and 936. The credit is allowed for the first eleven taxable years of a cor-poration that begin after December 31, 2005, and before January 1, 2017. A corporation was an existing credit claim-ant with respect to a American Samoa if (1) the corporation was engaged in the active conduct of a trade or business within Amer-ican Samoa on October 13, 1995, and (2) the corporation elected the benefits of the pos-session tax credit
1569in an election in effect for its taxable year that included October 13, 1995.1570A corporation that added a substan-tial new line of business (other than in a qualifying acquisition of all the assets of a trade or business of an existing credit claim-ant) ceased to be an existing credit claimant as of the close of the taxable year ending be-fore the date on which that new line of busi-ness was added. The amount of the credit allowed to a qualifying domestic corporation under the provision is equal to the sum of the amounts used in computing the corporation’s eco-nomic activity-based limitation with respect to American Samoa, except that no credit is allowed for the amount of any American Samoa income taxes. Thus, for any quali-fying corporation the amount of the credit equals the sum of (1) 60 percent of the cor-poration’s qualified American Samoa wages and allocable employee fringe benefit ex-penses and (2) 15 percent of the corporation’s depreciation allowances with respect to short-life qualified American Samoa tangible property, plus 40 percent of the corporation’s depreciation allowances with respect to me-dium-life qualified American Samoa tangible property, plus 65 percent of the corporation’s depreciation allowances with respect to long-life qualified American Samoa tangible property. The section 936(c) rule denying a credit or deduction for any possessions or foreign tax paid with respect to taxable income taken into account in computing the credit under section 936 does not apply with respect to the credit allowed by the provision. For taxable years beginning after Decem-ber 31, 2016 the credit rules are modified in two ways. First, domestic corporations with operations in American Samoa are allowed the credit even if those corporations are not existing credit claimants. Second, the credit is available to a domestic corporation (either an existing credit claimant or a new credit claimant) only if, in addition to satisfying all the present law requirements for claim-ing the credit, the corporation also has qualified production activities income (as de-fined in section 199(c) by substituting ‘‘American Samoa’’ for ‘‘the United States’’ in each place that latter term appears). In the case of a corporation that is an ex-isting credit claimant with respect to Amer-ican Samoa and that elected the application of section 936 for its last taxable year begin-ning before January 1, 2006, the credit ap-plies to the first nine taxable years of the corporation which begin after December 31, 2005, and before January 1, 2017. For any other corporation, the credit applies to the first three taxable years of that corporation which begin after December 31, 2011 and be-fore January 1, 2017. 
HOUSE BILL  The provision extends the credit for five years to apply (a) in the case of a corpora-tion that is an existing credit claimant with respect to American Samoa and that elected the application of section 936 for its last tax-able year beginning before January 1, 2006, to the first 17 taxable years of the corporation which begin after December 31, 2005, and be-fore January 1, 2023, and (b) in the case of any other corporation, to the first 11 taxable years of the corporation which begin after December 31, 2011 and before January 1, 2023. For purposes of this provision, section 119(e) of division A of the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 20061571is amended to in-dicate that any reference to section 199 of the Code is to be treated as a reference to section 199 as in effect before its repeal by the House bill. Effective date.—The provision is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2016. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  No provision. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement does not include the House bill provision. G. Other International Reforms 1. Restriction on insurance business exception to the passive foreign investment company rules (sec. 4501 of the House bill, sec. 14502 of the Senate amendment, and sec. 1297 of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  Passive foreign investment companies. The Tax Reform Act of 1986
1572established the PFIC anti-deferral regime. A PFIC is generally defined as any foreign corporation if 75 percent or more of its gross income for the taxable year consists of passive income, or 50 percent or more of its assets consists of assets that produce, or are held for the pro-duction of, passive income.
1573Alternative sets of income inclusion rules apply to U.S. persons that are shareholders in a PFIC, re-gardless of their percentage ownership in the company. One set of rules applies to PFICs that are qualified electing funds, under which electing U.S. shareholders currently include in gross income their respective shares of the company’s earnings, with a sep-arate election to defer payment of tax, sub-ject to an interest charge, on income not currently received.
1574A second set of rules applies to PFICs that are not qualified elect-ing funds, under which U.S. shareholders pay tax on certain income or gain realized through the company, plus an interest charge that is attributable to the value of deferral.
1575A third set of rules applies to PFIC stock that is marketable, under which electing U.S. shareholders currently take into account as income (or loss) the dif-ference between the fair market value of the stock as of the close of the taxable year and their adjusted basis in such stock (subject to certain limitations), often referred to as ‘‘marking to market.’’
1576 Under the PFIC regime, passive income is any income which is of a kind that would be foreign personal holding company income, including dividends, interest, royalties, rents, and certain gains on the sale or ex-change of property, commodities, or foreign currency. However, among other exceptions, passive income does not include any income derived in the active conduct of an insurance business by a corporation that is predomi-nantly engaged in an insurance business and that would be subject to tax under sub-chapter L if it were a domestic corpora-tion.

1579Treasury regulations proposed in 2015 have taken a different approach that is based on the cur-rent statutory rule. Prop. Treas. Reg. sec. 1.1297–4, 26 CFR Part 1, REG–108214–15, April 24, 2015. The pro-posed regulations provide that ‘‘the term insurance business means the business of issuing insurance and annuity contracts and the reinsuring of risks under-written by insurance companies, together with those investment activities and administrative services that are required to support or are substantially re-lated to insurance and annuity contracts issued or reinsured by the foreign corporation.’’ The proposed regulations provide that an investment activity is an activity producing foreign personal holding com-pany income, and that is ‘‘required to support or [is] substantially related to insurance and annuity con-tracts issued or reinsured by the foreign corporation to the extent that income from the activities is earned from assets held by the foreign corporation to meet obligations under the contracts.’’ The pre-amble to the proposed regulations specifically re-quests comments on the proposed regulations ‘‘with regard to how to determine the portion of a foreign insurance company’s assets that are held to meet obligations under insurance contracts issued or rein-sured by the company,’’ for example, if the assets ‘‘do not exceed a specified percentage of the corpora-tion’s total insurance liabilities for the year.’’ Ibid.

1581Sec. 934. In general, a bona fide resident of the U.S. Virgin Islands is required to file and pay tax only to the possession. Persons incurring income tax liability in both the United States and the U.S. Vir-gin Islands are required to file tax returns and pay income tax to both jurisdictions. the IRS analyzes whether risks assumed under contracts issued by a foreign company organized as an insurer are truly insurance risks, whether the risks are limited under the terms of the contracts, and the status of the company as an insurance company.
1578 
HOUSE BILL  The provision modifies the requirements for a corporation the income of which is not included in passive income for purposes of the PFIC rules. The provision replaces the test based on whether a corporation is pre-dominantly engaged in an insurance business with a test based on the corporation’s insur-ance liabilities.
1579The requirement that the foreign corporation would be subject to tax under subchapter L if it were a domestic cor-poration is retained. Under the provision, passive income for purposes of the PFIC rules does not include income derived in the active conduct of an insurance business by a corporation (1) that would be subject to tax under subchapter L if it were a domestic corporation; and (2) the applicable insurance liabilities of which con-stitute more than 25 percent of its total as-sets as reported on the company’s applicable financial statement for the last year ending with or within the taxable year. For the purpose of the provision’s excep-tion from passive income, applicable insur-ance liabilities mean, with respect to any property and casualty or life insurance busi-ness (1) loss and loss adjustment expenses, (2) reserves (other than deficiency, contingency, or unearned premium reserves) for life and health insurance risks and life and health in-surance claims with respect to contracts pro-viding coverage for mortality or morbidity risks. This includes loss reserves for prop-erty and casualty, life, and health insurance contracts and annuity contracts. Unearned premium reserves with respect to any type of risk are not treated as applicable insurance liabilities for purposes of the provision. For purposes of the provision, the amount of any applicable insurance liability may not ex-ceed the lesser of such amount (1) as re-ported to the applicable insurance regu-latory body in the applicable financial state-ment (or, if less, the amount required by ap-plicable law or regulation), or (2) as deter-mined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary. An applicable financial statement is a statement for financial reporting purposes that (1) is made on the basis of generally ac-cepted accounting principles, (2) is made on the basis of international financial reporting standards, but only if there is no statement made on the basis of generally accepted ac-counting principles, or (3) except as other-wise provided by the Secretary in regula-tions, is the annual statement required to be filed with the applicable insurance regu-latory body, but only if there is no state-ment made on either of the foregoing bases. Unless otherwise provided in regulations, it is intended that generally accepted account-ing principles means U.S. GAAP. The applicable insurance regulatory body means, with respect to any insurance busi-ness, the entity established by law to li-cense, authorize, or regulate such insurance business and to which the applicable finan-cial statement is provided. For example, in the United States, the applicable insurance regulatory body is the State insurance regu-lator to which the corporation provides its annual statement. If a corporation fails to qualify solely be-cause its applicable insurance liabilities con-stitute 25 percent or less of its total assets, a United States person who owns stock of the corporation may elect in such manner as the Secretary prescribes to treat the stock as stock of a qualifying insurance corpora-tion if (1) the corporation’s applicable insur-ance liabilities constitute at least 10 percent of its total assets, and (2) based on the appli-cable facts and circumstances, the corpora-tion is predominantly engaged in an insur-ance business, and its failure to qualify under the 25 percent threshold is due solely to runoff-related or rating-related cir-cumstances involving such insurance busi-ness. Facts and circumstances that tend to show the firm may not be predominantly engaged in an insurance business include a small number of insured risks with low likelihood but large potential costs; workers focused to a greater degree on investment activities than underwriting activities; and low loss exposure. Additional relevant facts for deter-mining whether the firm is predominantly engaged in an insurance business include: claims payment patterns for the current and prior years; the firm’s loss exposure as cal-culated for a regulator such as the SEC or for a rating agency, or if those are not cal-culated, for internal pricing purposes; the percentage of gross receipts constituting pre-miums for the current and prior years; and the number and size of insurance contracts issued or taken on through reinsurance by the firm. The fact that a firm has been hold-ing itself out as an insurer for a long period is not determinative either way. Runoff-related or rating-related cir-cumstances include, for example, the fact that the company is in runoff, that is, it is not taking on new insurance business (and consequently has little or no premium in-come), and is using its remaining assets to pay off claims with respect to pre-existing insurance risks on its books. Such cir-cumstances also include, for example, the application to the company of specific re-quirements with respect to capital and sur-plus relating to insurance liabilities imposed by a rating agency as a condition of obtain-ing a rating necessary to write new insur-ance business for the current year. Effective date.—The provision applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The Senate amendment is the same as the House bill. Effective date.—The provision applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the House bill and the Senate amendment. Effective date.—The provision applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 2. Repeal of fair market value of interest ex-pense apportionment (sec. 14503 of the Senate amendment and sec. 864 of the Code) HOUSE BILL  No provision. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The provision prohibits members of a U.S. affiliated group from allocating interest ex-pense on the basis of the fair market value of assets for purposes of section 864(e). Instead, the members must allocate interest expense based on the adjusted tax basis of assets. Effective date.—The provision is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement follows the Sen-ate amendment. Effective date.—The provision is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. 3. Modification to source rules involving pos-sessions (sec. 14504 of the Senate amend-ment and sec. 865 of the Code) 
PRESENT LAW  In general The U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Is-lands have income tax systems that ‘‘mir-ror’’ the U.S. Code, with the latter two pos-sessions being permitted under current law to delink and use their own tax systems pro-vided certain conditions are met. The U.S. Virgin Islands may also impose certain local income taxes in addition to taxes imposed by the mirror Code. The Code provides rules for coordination of United States and U.S. Vir-gin Islands taxation.
1580It permits the U.S. Virgin Islands to reduce or remit tax other-wise imposed by the mirror code if the tax is attributable to U.S. Virgin Islands source in-come or income effectively connected to the conduct of a trade or business in U.S. Virgin Islands.
1581The U.S. Virgin Islands has exer-cised that authority to provide development incentives for certain types of businesses op-erating within its borders. Under such initia-tives, companies can receive a 90 percent re-duction in their tax liability on certain in-come. Taxation of individuals Under the mirror Code, U.S. Virgin Islands citizens and residents are taxable on their worldwide income. A foreign tax credit is al-lowed for income taxes paid to the United States, foreign countries, and other posses-sions of the United States. In general, a bona fide resident of the U.S. Virgin Islands is re-quired to file and pay tax only to the posses-sion; compliance with that obligation satis-fies any Federal income tax filing obligation. All other U.S. residents or citizens with in-come from U.S. Virgin Island sources are subject to a dual filing requirement. In the case of an individual who is a U.S. citizen or alien residing in the United States or the U.S. Virgin Islands, only one tax is computed under the Code. If an individual is a bona fide resident of U.S. Virgin Islands for the entire taxable year, such tax is payable to the U.S. Virgin Islands and no U.S. tax is imposed. Otherwise, a citizen or resident of the United States who has income from

1582Sec. 932(b). See, Internal Revenue Service, Tax Guide for Individuals with Income from U.S. Possessions (Pub. 570), 2011, pp. 17–18. 
1583In Notice 2004–45, 2004–2 C.B. 33 (2004), the IRS described several scenarios in which U.S. persons claimed to have satisfied U.S. liabilities by having filed a return with the U.S. Virgin Islands.

1585Sec. 937. In the preamble to final regulations issued in 2008, certain de minimis exceptions are pro- vided for the U.S. citizen or resident with income from U.S. Virgin Island sources, in recognition that ‘‘the interaction of section 937 and other sections of the Code relating to the territories requires a bal-ance between implementing the policies Congress intended in section 937(b) while recognizing the ter-ritories’ efforts to retain and attract workers and businesses.’’ T.D. 9391, 73 F.R. 19350 (April 9, 2008); Treas.

1582 Concerns that U.S. citizens not resident in the U.S. Virgin Islands were improperly claiming residence in the U.S. Virgin Is-lands
1583or forming entities in the U.S. Vir-gin Islands in order to recharacterize income earned in the United States as sourced in the U.S. Virgin Islands and claim the 90 percent economic development credit led to legisla-tive changes in 2004.
1584These changes pro-vided a definition of bona fide residence in a possession and rules to determine source of income from possessions. They also impose a requirement that individuals report any change in residency status with respect to a possession during a taxable year.
1585 Taxation of corporations If a corporation is formed in U.S. Virgin Is-lands, it is classified as a domestic corpora-tion for U.S. Virgin Islands purposes and a foreign corporation for U.S. tax purposes. Such a corporation is only subject to U.S. tax if it has U.S.-source income or income ef-fectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States. U.S. Virgin Islands taxes a domestic corporation on its worldwide income, but the company is allowed a foreign tax credit against U.S. Vir-gin Islands tax for taxes imposed by the United States, foreign countries and other possessions. A corporation that is not formed in U.S. Virgin Islands is treated as a foreign corporation under the U.S. Virgin Islands mirror Code. A company not formed in U.S. Virgin Islands is only subject to U.S. Virgin Islands tax if it has U.S. Virgin Islands source income or income effectively con-nected with the conduct of a trade or busi-ness in U.S. Virgin Islands. The United States taxes its domestic corporations on their worldwide income, but allows a foreign tax credit for taxes imposed by foreign juris-dictions, including U.S. Virgin Islands. Sourcing rules As a general rule, the principles for deter-mining whether income is U.S. source are ap-plicable for purposes of determining whether income is possession source. In addition, the principles for determining whether income is effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business are applicable for pur-poses of determining whether income is ef-fectively connected to the conduct of a pos-session trade or business. However, except as provided in regulations, any income treated as U.S. source income or as effectively con-nected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business is not treated as income from with-in any possession or as effectively connected with a trade or business within any such pos-session.1586This rule applies regardless of where the office or fixed place of business connected to such trade or business is lo-cated. Section 865(j)(3) was added by the Tech-nical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988 (‘‘TAMRA’’),
1587and states that Treasury is authorized to waive the requirements im-posed by sections 865(e)(1)(B) and 865(g)(2) (both of which impose a 10 percent foreign tax requirement for source treatment of sales of personal property) for the purposes of determining Guam, American Samoa, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Is-lands, and Puerto Rico-source income (sec-tions 931 and 933, respectively). 
HOUSE BILL  No provision. 
SENATE AMENDMENT  The provision modifies the sourcing rule in section 937(b)(2) by modifying the U.S. in-come limitation to exclude only U.S. source (or effectively connected) income attrib-utable to a U.S. office or fixed place of busi-ness. The provision also modifies section 865(j)(3) by providing Treasury with the au-thority to waive the 10% foreign tax require-ment for source treatment of capital gains income earned by a U.S. Virgin Islands resi-dent. Effective date.—The provision shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2018. 
CONFERENCE AGREEMENT  The conference agreement does not include the Senate amendment provision. TITLE II Section 20001. Oil and Gas Program Section 20001 directs the Secretary of the Interior to establish and administer all as-pects of a competitive oil and gas program in the non-wilderness portion of the Arctic Na-tional Wildlife Refuge, known as the ‘‘1002 Area’’ or Coastal Plain. The legislation de-fines the term ‘‘Coastal Plain’’ by ref-erencing Plate 1 and Plate 2 of the October 24, 2017 Map prepared by the United States Geological Survey. The legislation repeals the prohibition on development from the Coastal Plain con-tained in section 1003 of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (16 U.S.C. 3143), and directs the Secretary to manage the oil and gas program on the Coastal Plain in a manner similar to what is required by the Naval Petroleum Reserves Production Act of 1976 (42 U.S.C. 6501 et seq.). The legis-lation sets a 16.67 percent royalty rate for leases and allocates 50 percent of the revenue derived from the program to the State of Alaska, with the remainder going to the Fed-eral Treasury. Section 20001 further requires the Sec-retary to conduct at least two area-wide lease sales within the 10-year budget win-dow—the first lease sale within four years of the Act’s enactment and the second lease sale within seven years of enactment. Each lease sale must contain not fewer than 400,000 acres and be comprised of those areas that have the highest hydrocarbon potential. The legislation directs the Secretary to issue any necessary rights-of-way or ease-ments across the Coastal Plain for the explo-ration, development, production, or trans-portation associated with the oil and gas program. Additionally, the section author-izes the development of up to 2,000 surface acres of federal land on the Coastal Plain. Section 20002. Limitations on Amount of Dis-tributed Qualified Outer Continental Shelf Revenues Section 20002 temporarily increases the an-nual limitation on offshore revenue sharing under section 105(f)(1) of the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 (Public Law 109– 432) for the states of Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas from $500 million an-nually for FY 2020 and FY 2021, to $650 mil-lion annually for those two fiscal years. Section 20003. Strategic Petroleum Reserve Drawdown and Sale Section 20003 directs the Secretary of En-ergy to draw down and sell a total of seven million barrels of crude oil from the Stra-tegic Petroleum Reserve during FY 2026 through FY 2027. The section prohibits the Secretary from taking actions that would limit the President’s authority to direct a drawdown and sale of petroleum products to address a domestic or international energy supply shortage pursuant to section 161(h) of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6241). The Secretary is further di-rected to stop the drawdown or sale of crude oil after the date on which a total of $600 million has been deposited in the general fund of the Federal Treasury. CONGRESSIONAL EARMARKS, LIMITED TAX BENEFITS, AND LIMITED TARIFF BENEFITS With respect to clause 9 of rule XXI of the Rules of the House of Representatives, the Committee has carefully reviewed the provi-sions of the bill and states that the provi-sions of the bill do not contain any congres-sional earmarks, limited tax benefits, or lim-ited tariff benefits within the meaning of the rule. TAX COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS Section 4022(b) of the Internal Revenue Service Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 requires the staff of the Joint Com-mittee on Taxation (in consultation with the Internal Revenue Service and the Treasury Department) to provide a tax complexity analysis. The complexity analysis is required for all legislation reported by the Senate Committee on Finance, the House Com-mittee on Ways and Means, or any com-mittee of conference if the legislation in-cludes a provision that directly or indirectly amends the Code and has widespread applica-bility to individuals or small businesses. The staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation has determined that the following provisions are of widespread applicability to individuals or small businesses. 1. Temporary modification of tax rates, tax brackets, standard deduction and repeal of personal exemptions (secs. 11001, 11002, 11021 and 11041 of the bill) Summary description of the provisions The bill temporarily changes the structure of the individual income tax by modifying the rate structure such that the tax brackets are 10-percent, 12-percent, 22-percent, 24-per-cent, 32-percent, 35-percent and 37-percent. The bill temporarily increases the size of the standard deduction (for 2018 the standard de-duction is $24,000 for joint filers, $18,000 for heads of household and $12,000 for other fil-ers), and temporarily eliminates personal ex-emptions. These provisions sunset for tax-able years beginning after December 31, 2025. Number of affected taxpayers It is estimated that the provision will af-fect approximately 120 million tax returns. Discussion It is not anticipated that individuals will need to keep additional records due to these provisions. It should not result in an in-crease in disputes with the IRS, nor will reg-ulatory guidance be necessary to implement this provision.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H10131 December 15, 2017 
The IRS will need to adjust its wage with-holding tables to reflect the repeal of per-sonal exemptions. Because revised wage withholding will occur within the first month of 2018, this would require employers to switch to new withholding tables some-what quickly, which can be expected to re-sult in a one-time additional burden for em-ployers (or potential additional costs for em-ployers that rely on a bookkeeping or pay-roll service). The IRS will need to modify its forms and publications. The temporary nature of the provision will necessitate that the IRS do this again once the temporary provisions ex-pire. Some taxpayers who currently itemize de-ductions may respond to the provision by claiming the increased standard deduction in lieu of itemizing. According to estimates by the staff of the Joint Committee on Tax-ation, approximately 94-percent of taxpayers will claim the standard deduction under the bill, up from approximately 70-percent under present law. These taxpayers will no longer have to file Schedule A to Form 1040, a sig-nificant number of which will no longer need to engage in the record keeping inherent in itemizing below-the-line deductions. More-over, by claiming the standard deduction, such taxpayers may qualify to use simpler versions of the Form 1040 (i.e., Form 1040EZ or Form 1040A) that are not available to in-dividuals who itemize their deductions. These forms simplify the return preparation process by eliminating from the Form 1040 those items that do not apply to particular taxpayers. This reduction in complexity and record keeping also may result in a decline in the number of individuals using a tax prepara-tion service, or tax preparation software, or a decline in the cost of such service or soft-ware. The provision also should reduce the number of disputes between taxpayers and the IRS regarding the substantiation of itemized deductions. 2. Temporary deduction for qualified busi-ness income (sec. 11011 of the bill) Summary description of the provisions For taxable years beginning after Decem-ber 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026, an in-dividual taxpayer generally may deduct 20 percent of qualified business income from a partnership, S corporation, or sole propri-etorship, as well as 20 percent of aggregate qualified REIT dividends, qualified coopera-tive dividends, and qualified publicly traded partnership income. Special rules apply to specified agricultural or horticultural co-operatives permitting the cooperative a de-duction. A limitation based on the greater of 50 per-cent of W–2 wages paid, or the sum of 25 per-cent of W–2 wages paid plus a capital allow-ance, is phased in above a threshold amount of taxable income. A disallowance of the de-duction with respect to specified service trades or businesses is also phased in above the same threshold amount of taxable in-come. The threshold amount is $157,500 (twice that amount or $315,000 in the case of a joint return), indexed. These limitations are fully phased in for a taxpayer with tax-able income in excess of the threshold amount plus $50,000 ($100,000 in the case of a joint return). Qualified business income for a taxable year generally means the net amount of do-mestic qualified items of income, gain, de-duction, and loss with respect to the tax-payer’s qualified businesses. Qualified busi-ness income does not include any amount paid by an S corporation that is treated as reasonable compensation of the taxpayer. Similarly, qualified business income does not include any guaranteed payment for services rendered with respect to the trade or business, and to the extent provided in regulations, does not include any amount al-located or distributed by a partnership to a partner who is acting other than in his or her capacity as a partner for services. Quali-fied business income or loss does not include certain investment-related income, gain, de-ductions, or loss. Number of affected taxpayers It is estimated that the provision will af-fect over ten percent of small business tax returns. Discussion It is not anticipated that individuals will need to keep additional records due to the provision. It should not result in an increase in disputes with the IRS, nor will regulatory guidance be necessary to implement this provision. It may, however, increase the number of questions that taxpayers ask the IRS, such as how to calculate qualified busi-ness income and how to apply the phaseins of the W–2 wage (or W–2 wage and capital) limit and of the exclusion of service business in-come in the case of taxpayers with taxable income exceeding the threshold amount of $157,500 (twice that amount or $315,000 in the case of a joint return), indexed. This in-creased volume of questions could have an adverse impact on other elements of IRS’s operation, such as the levels of taxpayer service. The provision should not increase the tax preparation costs for most individ-uals. The IRS will need to add to the individual income tax forms package a new worksheet so that taxpayers can calculate their quali-fied business income, as well as the phaseins. This worksheet will require a series of cal-culations. 3. Temporary increase in child tax credit (sec. 11022 of the bill) Summary description of the provisions The bill temporarily increases the value of the child tax credit to $2,000, providing that no more than $1,400 per child shall be refund-able. This $1,400 limitation is indexed for in-flation. In order to qualify for the child tax credit, a Social Security number must be provided for the qualifying child for whom such credit is claimed. These provisions sun-set for taxable years beginning after Decem-ber 31, 2025. Number of affected taxpayers It is estimated that the provision will af-fect approximately 90 million tax returns. Discussion It is not anticipated that individuals will need to keep additional records due to these provisions. It should not result in an in-crease in disputes with the IRS, nor will reg-ulatory guidance be necessary to implement this provision. The provision may, however, increase the number of questions that tax-payers ask the IRS, such as whether they may claim the new family credit for certain members of their household, or whether and to what extent the combined tax credit is re-fundable. The IRS will need to modify its forms and publications to reflect this change. The tem-porary nature of the provision will neces-sitate that the IRS do this again once the temporary provision expires. 4. Temporary suspension of the deduction for State and local income taxes (sec. 11042 of the bill) Summary description of the provisions The bill provides that in the case of an in-dividual, as a general matter, State, local, and foreign property taxes and State and local sales taxes are allowed as a deduction only when paid or accrued in carrying on a trade or business, or an activity described in section 212 (relating to expenses for the pro-duction of income). Thus, the provision al-lows only those deductions for State, local, and foreign property taxes, and sales taxes, that are presently deductible in computing income on an individual’s Schedule C, Sched-ule E, or Schedule F on such individual’s tax return. Thus, for instance, in the case of property taxes, an individual may deduct such items only if these taxes were imposed on business assets (such as residential rental property). Under the bill, in the case of an individual, State and local income, war profits, and ex-cess profits taxes are not allowable as a de-duction. The bill contains an exception to the above-stated rule. Under the provision a tax-payer may claim an itemized deduction of up to $10,000 ($5,000 for married taxpayer filing a separate return) for the aggregate of (i) State and local property taxes not paid or accrued in carrying on a trade or business, or an activity described in section 212, and (ii) State and local income, war profits, and ex-cess profits taxes (or sales taxes in lieu of in-come, etc. taxes) paid or accrued in the tax-able year. Foreign real property taxes may not be deducted under this exception. The above rules apply to taxable years be-ginning after December 31, 2017, and begin-ning before January 1, 2026. The bill also provides that, in the case of an amount paid in a taxable year beginning before January 1, 2018, with respect to a State or local income tax imposed for a tax-able year beginning after December 31, 2017, the payment shall be treated as paid on the last day of the taxable year for which such tax is so imposed for purposes of applying the provision limiting the dollar amount of the deduction. Thus, under the provision, an individual may not claim an itemized deduc-tion in 2017 on a pre-payment of income tax for a future taxable year in order to avoid the dollar limitation applicable for taxable years beginning after 2017. Number of affected taxpayers It is estimated that the provision will af-fect approximately 44 million tax returns. Discussion It is not anticipated that individuals will need to keep additional records due to this provision. Because the deduction for State and local taxes has been longstanding in the Code, its repeal may require regulatory guid-ance, so as to provide guidance for taxpayers regarding which taxes remain properly de-ductible on an individual’s Schedule C, Schedule E or Schedule F. This may also re-sult in an increase in disputes with the IRS. The IRS will need to modify its forms and publications to reflect this change. The tem-porary nature of the provision will neces-sitate that the IRS do this again once the temporary provision expires. 5. Modifications of rules for expensing depre-ciable business assets (sec. 13101 of the bill) The bill increases the maximum amount a taxpayer may expense under section 179 to $1,000,000, and increases the phase-out threshold amount to $2,500,000. The $1,000,000 and $2,500,000 amounts, as well as the $25,000 sport utility vehicle limitation, are indexed for inflation for taxable years beginning after 2018. The bill expands the definition of section 179 property to include certain depreciable tangible personal property used predomi-nantly to furnish lodging or in connection with furnishing lodging. The bill also expands the definition of qualified real property eligible for section 179 expensing to include any of the following

improvements to nonresidential real prop-erty placed in service after the date such property was first placed in service: roofs; heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning property; fire protection and alarm systems; and security systems. The bill applies to property placed in serv-ice in taxable years beginning after Decem-ber 31, 2017. Number of affected taxpayers It is estimated that the provision will af-fect over ten percent of small business tax returns. Discussion While taxpayers purchasing section 179 property will still be required to complete and file Form 4562, Depreciation and Amorti-zation (Including Information on Listed Property), significantly less detail is re-quired to be included on such form. Accord-ingly, the compliance burden of many tax-payers will be reduced. 6. Temporary 100-percent expensing for cer-tain business assets (sec. 13201 of the bill) The bill extends and modifies the addi-tional first-year depreciation deduction through 2026 (through 2027 for longer produc-tion period property and certain aircraft). The 50-percent allowance is increased to 100 percent for property acquired and placed in service after September 27, 2017, and before January 1, 2023 (January 1, 2024, for longer production period property and certain air-craft), as well as for specified plants planted or grafted after September 27, 2017, and be-fore January 1, 2023. Thus, the bill follows the present-law phase-down of bonus depre-ciation for property acquired before Sep-tember 28, 2017, and placed in service after September 27, 2017. The 100-percent allow-ance is phased down by 20 percent per cal-endar year for property placed in service, and specified plants planted or grafted, in taxable years beginning after 2022 (after 2023 for longer production period property and certain aircraft). The bill removes the requirement that the original use of qualified property must com-mence with the taxpayer (i.e., it allows the additional first-year depreciation deduction for new and used property). As a conforming amendment to the repeal of corporate AMT, the election to accelerate AMT credits in lieu of bonus depreciation is repealed. The bill maintains the section 280F in-crease amount of $8,000 for passenger auto-mobiles placed in service after December 31, 2017. However, the bill follows the present- law phase-down of the section 280F increase amount in the limitation on the depreciation deduction allowed with respect to certain passenger automobiles acquired before Sep-tember 28, 2017, and placed in service after September 27, 2017. The bill extends the special rule under the percentage-of-completion method for the al-location of bonus depreciation to a long- term contract for property placed in service before January 1, 2027 (January 1, 2028, in the case of longer production period property). The bill expands the definition of qualified property eligible for the additional first-year depreciation allowance to include qualified film, television and live theatrical produc-tions (as defined in section 181(d) and (e)) for which a deduction otherwise would have been allowable under section 181 without re-gard to the dollar limitation or termination of such section, effective for productions placed in service after September 27, 2017, and before January 1, 2027. For purposes of this provision, a production is considered placed in service at the time of initial re-lease, broadcast, or live staged performance (i.e., at the time of the first commercial ex-hibition, broadcast, or live staged perform-ance of a production to an audience). The bill excludes from the definition of qualified property any property which is pri-marily used in the trade or business of the furnishing or sale of (1) electrical energy, water, or sewage disposal services, (2) gas or steam through a local distribution system, or (3) transportation of gas or steam by pipe-line, if the rates for such furnishing or sale, as the case may be, have been established or approved by a State or political subdivision thereof, by any agency or instrumentality of the United States, by a public service or pub-lic utility commission or other similar body of any State or political subdivision thereof, or by the governing or ratemaking body of an electric cooperative. The bill excludes from the definition of qualified property any property used in a trade or business that has had floor plan fi-nancing indebtedness, unless the taxpayer with such trade or business is not a tax shel-ter prohibited from using the cash method and is exempt from the interest limitation rules by meeting a small business $25 million gross receipts test. Number of affected taxpayers It is estimated that the provision will af-fect over ten percent of small business tax returns. Discussion The reporting requirements are unchanged by this provision. Capital assets purchased during the tax year will still need to be re-ported on Form 4562, Depreciation and Amor-tization (Including Information on Listed Property); however, the current year tax de-duction associated with such assets will in-crease.

TO HONOR THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF JAMES WILLIAM LAWYER 
HON. RODNEY DAVIS 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, December 15, 2017 Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speak-er, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of James William Lawyer, a friend to many in Taylorville and Christian County, who passed away on December 6, 2017. Jim Lawyer is an-other tragic victim of Alzheimer’s disease. A beloved member of the Taylorville com-munity, Jim was a valued volunteer in many local organizations, which included serving as coach of the original Taylorville Junior Football League team, the Bears. Jim served as one of my football coaches during my freshman and sophomore years at Taylorville High School, and was an invaluable mentor and teacher. Years later, I was blessed with the opportunity to coach his grandsons in the local JFL league and pass on many of the lessons and guidance that Jim gave to me. Throughout his life, Jim impacted a count-less number of lives, mine included. Please keep his wife, Janet, and the rest of his family in your thoughts and prayers.

RECOGNIZING JO LAWSON, THE OLDEST LIVING FEMALE VET-ERAN OF MERCER COUNTY, ILLI-NOIS 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, December 15, 2017 Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mrs. Jo Lawson, the oldest living female veteran of Mercer County, Illinois. Mrs. Lawson has lived a life of service to her com-munity and her country. Mrs. Lawson grew up on a farm in Aledo. After graduating from Aledo High School, she attended the University of Iowa, where she majored in elementary education. In 1944, at twenty-three years old, Mrs. Lawson joined the United States Coast Guard. She attended basic training in West Palm Beach, Florida. Following basic training, Mrs. Lawson at-tended six months of radioman training in At-lantic City, New Jersey. After radioman train-ing, she was stationed in San Pedro, Cali-fornia. Her primary duty there was to receive messages over teletype, which often included receiving coordinates for ships and fallen air-craft. In 1946, Mrs. Lawson was discharged with a rank of 3rd Class Radioman. In 1950, she married Colonel Dave Lawson. They were classmates in high school and stayed in contact throughout the years fol-lowing their graduation They were later re-united in California. Colonel and Mrs. Lawson were married sixty-three years, until Colonel Lawson passed away in September of 2015. They had five children together, losing one to prematurity, and were also blessed with four grandchildren. In Mercer County, Mrs. Lawson taught one year at Perryton and taught seventh grade so-cial studies at Northside Junior High. Along with serving her community through teaching, Mrs. Lawson was involved with and cofounded many local organizations, including the 708 Mental Health Board and Mercer County Re-cycling. Additionally, she was a planning board representative at her church, where she helped start the Churches of Mercer County Food Pantry. Mr. Speaker, I would like to again honor Jo Lawson for her extraordinary service to both her country and her community. f 
HONORING ZACHARY GOLDBERG 
HON. DWIGHT EVANS 
OF PENNSYLVANIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, December 15, 2017 Mr. EVANS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a dedicated, driven and hard-working young man from the Second Congressional District of Pennsylvania, Zachary Goldberg, the winner of this year’s Congressional App Challenge in my District. Zachary Goldberg is a Chestnut Hill resident and a senior at Germantown Friends School in Philadelphia. For this year’s Congressional App Challenge Zachary created an app called the Pennsylvania Legislation Tracker. In his words: ‘‘I developed the Pennsylvania Legisla-tion Tracker to make information about the Pennsylvania General Assembly more readily available, enabling people to keep up to date on which legislation is currently being consid-ered and supported by their state legislators.’’ Our students are our next generation of leaders. I was so impressed by Zachary’s at-tention to detail and keen awareness to help our community by developing such a thought-ful app that aims to keep Philadelphians and Pennsylvanians more informed in the political process. It is great to see such a passion for politics and helping others at a young age. The 2nd Congressional District of Pennsyl-vania is very proud of this great accomplish-ment and extends gratitude to Zachary Gold-berg for his efforts to fight for a stronger to-morrow and dedicated support to the Com-monwealth of Pennsylvania.

IN RECOGNITION OF MASHPEE HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL 
HON. WILLIAM R. KEATING 
OF MASSACHUSETTS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, December 15, 2017 Mr. KEATING. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Mashpee High School’s third consecutive Super Bowl victory. On December 2nd the Mashpee Falcons faced off against the Blackstone Valley Tech Beavers in the Division 7 Super Bowl. The Falcons were up by six points with three min-utes left in the game and a last minute inter-ception sealed this 22–16 victory. Fans erupt-ed in ‘‘three-peat’’ cheers at Gillette Stadium, home of the New England Patriots. This is the third consecutive and fourth overall state championship for Mashpee High School Foot-ball. They left it all on the field last weekend and, as Coach Belichick would say, ‘‘did their job.’’ The dedication and support of every player, every cheerleader, their families, the coaches, and other faculty members set the foundation for the Falcons’ undefeated season. With over twenty straight wins under their belt, I have no doubt that the Falcons will continue to make our community proud. I look forward to fol-lowing their season next year and wish all of our graduating seniors continued success in the future. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to honor the third consecutive Super Bowl victory for Mashpee High School. I ask that my colleagues join me in congratulating them and wishing them all the best in the many seasons to come. f

RECOGNIZING HANNA GRADE SCHOOL FOR ITS COMMITMENT TO PROTECTING THE ENVIRON-MENT 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, December 15, 2017 Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Hanna Grade School in Orion, Il-linois, on being recognized by Nature and Cul-ture International for its commitment to pro-tecting the environment. Hanna Grade School has raised money for Nature and Culture International every year since 1999. Each year, their donation goes to a different part of the world in order to support an environmental cause. This year’s donation went to protecting jaguars in Mexico. Nature and Culture International is a nonprofit organi-zation that works to protect biologically diverse environments in Latin America. Hanna Grade School was the only school mentioned in this year’s Nature and Culture International bro-chure, the first time this has been produced.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD —Extensions of RemarksE1714 December 15, 2017 
Since 1999, Hanna Grade School has raised more than $6,000. That amount is enough to save more than 120 acres of rainforest. Mr. Speaker, I’d like to recognize Hanna Grade School for its outstanding hard work and dedication to protecting the environment, and thank its former and current students, par-ents, and faculty for their devotion to making the world a better place.

IN RECOGNITION OF LORI S. LIU 
HON. JACKIE SPEIER 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, December 15, 2017 Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Lori Liu who is leaving public service after four years on the Brisbane City Council, the last year as Mayor of this storied town near San Francisco Bay. Lori’s deep commitment to public service is evident from her accomplish-ments and contributions to her community. She is a champion of education, children, the arts, recreation, economic development and the environment. Lori was first elected to the council in 2013. While on the council, she served on, or as representative to, a number of organizations, including the Association of Bay Area Govern-ments, the Peninsula Clean Energy Board of Directors, the County Library JPA, the coun-cil’s Economic Development Subcommittee, the Health and Safety Subcommittee, the League of California Cities, the liaison to the Parks and Recreation Commission, the Airport Community Roundtable, the Planning Com-mission, the liaison to the Open Space and Ecology Committee, the Community Choice Energy Advisory Committee and many others. You may justifiably surmise from this lengthy list that Lori is well-versed in a variety of issues affecting the residents of Brisbane and the region. Her leadership is notable as she tackled one of the most longstanding opportunities and challenges in the community: the Baylands Project. Lori was indefatigable as she conducted council meetings and listened closely to the community through hours of dis-cussions involving possible offices, open space, housing, environmental cleanup and restoration, and the overall concept of a sus-tainable community. She carefully weighed the impacts of this project on Brisbane and our re-gion. She was instrumental in laying the ground-work to build a new library which will be con-structed starting next year. Libraries are com-munity spaces that connect generations and nurture life-long learning. The Brisbane Library will include a Maker’s Space to spark the cre-ativity of the next generation of innovators, spaces for children and teens, a quiet study area, an outdoor garden, a community center, and the first public arts project triggered by a city ordinance. Lori has a long track record of working on environmental issues. In fact, when she moved to Brisbane in 2004, her very first vol-unteer activity was to attend an Earth Day clean up event. While on the council, she helped to secure a grant to renovate Crocker Park Trail. This funding will make the trail more usable for bicyclists, joggers and parents with strollers. It will also establish a safe pe-destrian and bike-friendly connection between residential development at the Ridge and Lipman Middle School. Due in part to Lori’s outstanding work, Brisbane received the Plat-inum level Spotlight Award from the Institute for Local Government for environmental lead-ership and best practices. With her support, the city signed up to have all municipal electric accounts serviced by 100 percent renewable energy. Lori understands that a high quality of life for residents depends on a healthy balance of physical and financial security, education, functioning infrastructure, clean air and clean water, and recreation and entertainment. Life without music and fun would not be complete, so Lori supported the launch of two spectac-ular, family-friendly community events, the Ma-rina Kite Festival and the Star City Music Fes-tival. The kite festival celebrated its first anni-versary this June and the music festival will have its premier in July next year. Lori holds a B.A. from Tufts University and a J.D. from Northwestern University School of Law. She and her husband Raymond Liu live in Brisbane with their two young children, Samantha and Noah. Mr. Speaker, I ask the House of Represent-atives to rise with me to honor Lori Liu for her exemplary service on the Brisbane City Coun-cil. Her public service made Brisbane a better place to live, work and visit. I personally regret that she is leaving office and hope she will re-turn to offer Brisbane her skills and talents in addressing the issues facing her beloved city. I have no doubt that Lori will continue to make enormous contributions to any effort she un-dertakes.

CONGRATULATING GALESBURG, ILLINOIS FOR BEING NAMED A PROJECT WINNER FOR THE 2017 GOVERNOR’S HOMETOWN AWARD 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, December 15, 2017 Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Galesburg, Illinois for being named a project winner for the 2017 Gov-ernor’s Hometown Award due to its out-standing Galesburg Heart & Soul program. The Galesburg Heart & Soul project is a community revitalization and development ef-fort, based on broad and vigorous resident participation. The project’s goal is to allow residents to voice what they value most about their town and encourage them to actively par-ticipate in community development. The project did this by collecting the input of Galesburg Residents from all walks of life through hosting multiple focus groups. Based on their voices, an action plan was built in order to guide all stakeholders to develop a stronger, healthier, and more economically dy-namic community for all. The hard work and community collaboration visible through the Galesburg Heart & Soul project makes me especially proud to serve Il-linois’ 17th Congressional District. Mr. Speak-er, I would like to again formally congratulate Galesburg, Illinois for being named a project winner for the 2017 Governor’s Hometown Award. HONORING THE LIFE OF CHARLES GILBERT SLEPIAN HON. JAMES B. RENACCI 
OF OHIO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, December 15, 2017 Mr. RENACCI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the life of Charles Gilbert Slepian. A veteran of the United States Army, Charles dedicated his life to protecting and serving his country. Charles ‘‘Chic’’ Slepian was born and raised in the South Bronx in New York, New York. Charles was a loving husband to his wife Pa-tricia Murray, dedicated father to his children Jon and Keri from his marriage with Nita Koval, and to Jenny and James from his mar-riage to Jeanette Slepian. He was a caring grandfather to his many grandchildren and proud uncle to Michael and Mark Slepian, and Lori Mulick. A graduate of the City College of New York and Fordham Law School, Charles had a rich career as an educator and attorney. He served as Deputy Commissioner to New York City Mayor John Lindsay. Additionally, he founded the Foreseeable Risk Analysis Center to consult on various security protocols. As a security consultant, Slepian was frequently called upon by national media outlets to offer his expert analysis on the improvement of se-curity practices. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to recognize a life so fully lived. Charles shared his energy with those whom he worked and instilled his values of sacrifice and service in his loved ones. His son, James Slepian, served not only as my chief of staff, but my confidant and friend. I am grateful for the Slepian family’s service to our country and ask my colleagues in the House to join me in paying tribute to a valued soldier and citizen, Charles Gilbert Slepian.

HONORING U.S. NATIONAL GUARD’S 381ST BIRTHDAY 
HON. J. FRENCH HILL 
OF ARKANSAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, December 15, 2017 Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the men and women of the National Guard for their 381 years of dedicated service and sac-rifice to the defense of our nation. On December 13, 1636, the first militia regi-ments in North America were organized in Massachusetts. From deploying overseas in theaters of war, to being activated by our nation’s governors in times of natural disaster, the Guard has been a critical component of our national security strategy, and an integral part of America’s mili-tary supremacy. I extend my thanks to Arkansas’s Adjutant General, Mark Berry, for his dedication and leadership of Arkansas’s Guard. Thank you to those Guardsmen who are currently deployed overseas, including the Ar-kansas Guardsmen currently deployed around the world in Kosovo and Kuwait. But most of all, thank you to those National Guardsmen who have given the ultimate sac-rifice in defense of our nation.

CONGRATULATING FULTON COUN-TY, ILLINOIS FOR BEING NAMED A PROJECT WINNER FOR THE 2017 GOVERNOR’S HOMETOWN AWARD 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, December 15, 2017 Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Fulton County, Illinois for being named a project winner for the 2017 Gov-ernor’s Hometown Award due to its excep-tional recovery efforts following the event of the Canton Gas Explosion. On November 16, 2016, the town of Canton and County of Fulton were impacted by a nat-ural gas explosion. This tragic incident de-stroyed one building, damaged 66 buildings, left 12 people injured, and left one person dead. The explosion was felt as far away as one mile. The explosion occurred in downtown Canton and affected many major businesses. However, instead of faltering, the community chose to come together and show what it means to be Canton Strong. In addition to public safety agencies, many volunteer agen-cies and volunteers themselves helped move Canton toward recovery. The Canton Cham-ber of Commerce also kept businesses in-formed and helped them get up and running again. This community’s response minimized the number of residents affected, job loss, and tax revenue loss. The hard work, perseverance, and commu-nity collaboration visible through Fulton Coun-ty’s recovery efforts makes me especially proud to serve Illinois’ 17th Congressional Dis-trict. Mr. Speaker, I would like to again formally congratulate Fulton County, Illinois for being named a project winner for the 2017 Gov-ernor’s Hometown Award.
