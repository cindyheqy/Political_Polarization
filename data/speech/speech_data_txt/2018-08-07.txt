COMMEMORATING THE 53RD ANNI-VERSARY OF THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT OF 1965 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, August 7, 2018 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today not just to commemorate the landmark achievement of 53 years ago but to inform our colleagues and the nation of the need to re-double and rededicate our efforts to the work that remains to be done to protect the right of all Americans to vote free from discrimination and the injustices that prevent them from exer-cising this most fundamental right of citizen-ship. On August 6, 1965, in the Rotunda of the Capitol and in the presence of such luminaries as the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Rev. Ralph Abernathy of the Southern Chris-tian Leadership Conference; Roy Wilkins of the NAACP; Whitney Young of the National Urban League; James Foreman of the Con-gress of Racial Equality; A. Philip Randolph of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters; John Lewis of the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee; Senators Robert Kennedy, Hubert Humphrey, and Everett Dirksen; President Johnson addressed the nation before signing the Voting Rights Act: 
The vote is the most powerful instrument ever devised by man for breaking down injus-tice and destroying the terrible walls which imprison men because they are different from other men. 
The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was critical to preventing brazen voter discrimination viola-tions that historically left millions of African Americans disenfranchised. In 1940, for example, there were less than 30,000 African Americans registered to vote in Texas and only about 3 percent of African Americans living in the South were registered to vote. Poll taxes, literacy tests, and threats of vio-lence were the major causes of these racially discriminatory results. After passage of the Voting Rights Act in 1965, which prohibited these discriminatory practices, registration and electoral participa-tion steadily increased to the point that by 2012, more than 1.2 million African Americans living in Texas were registered to vote. In 1964, the year before the Voting Rights Act became law, there were approximately 300 African-Americans in public office, includ-ing just three in Congress. Few, if any, African Americans held elective office anywhere in the South. Because of the Voting Rights Act, today there are more than 9,100 black elected offi-cials, including 46 members of Congress, the largest number ever. Because of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 signed into law by President Lyndon Johnson on this day 53 years ago, I stand before you as the first African American woman Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations. Mr. Speaker, the Voting Rights Act opened the political process for many of the approxi-mately 6,000 Hispanic public officials that have been elected and appointed nationwide, including more than 275 at the state or federal level, 32 of whom serve in Congress. Native Americans, Asians and others who have historically encountered harsh barriers to full political participation also have benefited greatly. The crown jewel of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 is Section 5, which requires that states and localities with a chronic record of discrimi-nation in voting practices secure federal ap-proval before making any changes to voting processes. Section 5 protects minority voting rights where voter discrimination has historically been the worst. Since 1982, Section 5 has stopped more than 1,000 discriminatory voting changes in their tracks, including 107 discriminatory changes right here in Texas. And it is a source of eternal pride to all of us in Houston that in pursuit of extending the full measure of citizenship to all Americans, in 1975 Congresswoman Barbara Jordan, who also represented this historic 18th Congres-sional District of Texas, introduced, and the Congress adopted, what are now Sections 4(f)(3) and 4(f)(4) of the Voting Rights Act, which extended the protections of Section 4(a) and Section 5 to language minorities. During the floor debate on the 1975 reau-thorization of the Voting Rights Act, Congress-woman Jordan explained why this reform was needed: 
There are Mexican-American people in the State of Texas who have been denied the right to vote; who have been impeded in their efforts to register and vote; who have not had encouragement from those election officials because they are brown people. So, the state of Texas, if we approve this measure, would be brought within the cov-erage of this Act for the first time. 
When it comes to extending and protecting the precious right vote, the Lone Star State— the home state of Lyndon Johnson and Bar-bara Jordan—can be the leading state in the Union, one that sets the example for the na-tion. But to realize that future, we must turn from and not return to the dark days of the past. We must remain ever vigilant and oppose all schemes that will abridge or dilute the pre-cious right to vote. Mr. Speaker, I am here today to remind the nation that the right to vote—that ‘‘powerful in-strument that can break down the walls of in-justice’’—is facing grave threats. The threat stems from the decision issued in June 2013 by the Supreme Court in Shelby County v. Holder, 570 U.S. 193 (2013), which invalidated Section 4(b) of the VRA, and para-lyzed the application of the VRA’s Section 5 preclearance requirements. According to the Supreme Court majority, the reason for striking down Section 4(b) was that ‘‘times change.’’ Now, the Court was right; times have changed. But what the Court did not fully appreciate is that the positive changes it cited are due al-most entirely to the existence and vigorous enforcement of the Voting Rights Act. And that is why the Voting Rights Act is still needed. Let me put it this way: in the same way that the vaccine invented by Dr. Jonas Salk in 1953 eradicated the crippling effects but did not eliminate the cause of polio, the Voting Rights Act succeeded in stymieing the prac-tices that resulted in the wholesale disenfran-chisement of African Americans and language minorities but did eliminate them entirely. The Voting Rights Act is needed as much today to prevent another epidemic of voting disenfranchisement as Dr. Salk’s vaccine is still needed to prevent another polio epidemic. However, officials in some states, notably Texas and North Carolina, seemed to regard the Shelby decision as a green light and rushed to implement election laws, policies, and practices that could never pass muster under the Section 5 preclearance regime. My constituents remember very well the Voter ID law passed in Texas in 2011, which required every registered voter to present a valid government-issued photo ID on the day of polling in order to vote. The Justice Department blocked the law in March of 2012, and it was Section 5 that pro-hibited it from going into effect. At least it did until the Shelby decision, be-cause on the very same day that Shelby was decided officials in Texas announced they would immediately implement the Photo ID law, and other election laws, policies, and practices that could never pass muster under the Section 5 preclearance regime. The Texas Photo ID law was challenged in federal court and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit upheld the decision of U.S. District Court Judge Nelva Gonzales Ramos that Texas’ strict voter identification law dis-criminated against blacks and Hispanics and violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. Mr. Speaker, protecting voting rights and combating voter suppression schemes are two of the critical challenges facing our great de-mocracy. Without safeguards to ensure that all citi-zens have equal access to the polls, more in-justices are likely to occur and the voices of millions silenced. Those of us who cherish the right to vote justifiably are skeptical of Voter ID laws be-cause we understand how these laws, like poll taxes and literacy tests, can be used to im-pede or negate the ability of seniors, racial and language minorities, and young people to cast their votes. Consider the demographic groups who lack a government issued ID: 1. African Americans: 25 percent. 2. Asian Americans: 20 percent. 3. Hispanic Americans: 19 percent. 4. Young people, aged 18–24: 18 percent. 5. Persons with incomes less than $35,000: 15 percent.

And there are other ways abridging or sup-pressing the right to vote, including: 1. Curtailing or eliminating early voting. 2. Ending same-day registration. 3. Not counting provisional ballots cast in the wrong precinct on Election Day will not count. 4. Eliminating adolescent pre-registration. 5. Shortening poll hours. 6. Lessening the standards governing voter challenges thus allowing self-proclaimed ‘‘bal-lot security vigilantes’’ like the King Street Pa-triots to cause trouble at the polls. Mr. Speaker, on this day, the 53rd anniver-sary of the landmark Voting Rights Act signed into law by President Lyndon Johnson on Au-gust 6, 1965, I call upon House Speaker R
YAN to bring legislation intended to protect the right to vote of all Americans to the floor for debate and vote. Specifically, I call for the passage of the Voting Rights Advancement Act, (H.R. 2978) of which I am an original co-sponsor, which repairs the damage done to the Voting Rights Act by the Supreme Court’s Shelby decision. This legislation provides even greater fed-eral oversight of jurisdictions which have a his-tory of voter suppression and protects vulner-able communities from discriminatory voting practices. Mr. Speaker, before concluding there is one other point I would like to stress. In his address to the nation before signing the Voting Rights Act of 1965, President John-son said: 
Presidents and Congresses, laws and law-suits can open the doors to the polling places and open the doors to the wondrous rewards which await the wise use of the ballot. But only the individual Negro, and all oth-ers who have been denied the right to vote, can really walk through those doors, and can use that right, and can transform the vote into an instrument of justice and fulfillment. 
In other words, political power—and the jus-tice, opportunity, inclusion, and fulfillment it provides—comes not from the right to vote but in the exercise of that right. And that means it is the civic obligation of every citizen to both register and vote in every election, state and local as well as federal. Because if we can register and vote, but fail to do so, we are guilty of voluntary voter sup-pression, the most effective method of dis-enfranchisement ever devised. And in recent years, Americans have not been doing a very good job of exercising our civic responsibility to register, vote, and make their voices heard. Mr. Speaker, for millions of Americans, the right to vote protected by the Voting Rights Act of 1965 is sacred treasure, earned by the sweat and toil and tears and blood of ordinary Americans who showed the world it was pos-sible to accomplish extraordinary things. So on this 53rd anniversary of that landmark law, let us rededicate ourselves to honoring those who won for us this precious right by re-maining vigilant and fighting against both the efforts of others to abridge or suppress the right to vote and our own apathy in exercising this sacred right. TRIBUTE TO UNION COUNTY ISU EXTENSION AND OUTREACH HON. DAVID YOUNG 
OF IOWA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, August 7, 2018 Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Union County ISU Ex-tension and Outreach in Creston, Iowa on their 100-year anniversary. This is an impor-tant milestone in their history of service to Southwest Iowa and the Third Congressional District. Iowa State University Extension and Out-reach began in 1862 when President Lincoln signed into the Morrill Act, which established land-grant university systems. Extension and Outreach engaged farmers and homemakers to improve seeds, farming, and home prac-tices. ISU Extension and Outreach now fo-cuses on four main topics, ag and natural re-sources, health and well-being, economic de-velopment, and youth and 4–H outreach op-portunities. Throughout its many years of service, ISU Extension and Outreach has successfully met the needs of Southwest Iowa by providing ex-cellent education for youth through 4–H and adults with necessary services to the commu-nities. I congratulate Union County Extension on this historic anniversary and it is an honor to represent its employees in the United States Congress. I wish them nothing but con-tinued success.

IN RECOGNITION OF MR. FERNANDO ‘‘FRED’’ C. MACHADO 
HON. DAVID G. VALADAO 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, August 7, 2018 Mr. VALADAO. Mr. Speaker, today I rise alongside Representative J
IMCOSTA and Rep- resentative D
EVIN NUNES to recognize the life and public service of Fernando ‘‘Fred’’ C. Machado, a farmer, military veteran, and long- time advocate of California agriculture. Mr. Fred Machado was born on March 4, 1932 and emigrated with his family from the Azores Islands of Portugal to the United States at the age of sixteen. Fred’s parents, Joe F. and Margaret C. Machado, had seven children of which, Fred was the oldest. Grow-ing up, Fred worked various farm jobs such as milking cows, driving trucks, picking cotton, and harvesting grapes. At the age of nineteen, Fred joined the United States Navy and served aboard the USS Montague AKA 98 during the Korean Conflict. While in the military, he saved enough money to buy a car and a used trac-tor, and leased twenty-five acres. He realized his life-long ambition, to be a farmer, in 1956 when he bought his first forty acres. In 1957, he married his wife, Maxine Finney, and in 1970 expanded his personal farming operation to include a fifty-head Holstein dairy that grew over the years. Mr. Machado joined the Fresno County Farm Bureau in 1957. In 1960, he attended an Easton Center meeting and became Vice Chairman. From there, Machado climbed the ranks, eventually serving as Fresno County Farm Bureau President from 1972 to 1974. Mr. Machado was a major presence on agri-cultural boards and committees for decades throughout Fresno County and California. He served on the board of directors of the Na-tional Milk Producers Federation, Challenge Daily, Danish Creamery, and Ag One Founda-tion. Mr. Machado served three years on the Big Fresno Fair Board, appointed by President Ronald Reagan. In 1985, Frank Machado re-ceived Distinguished Service Awards from both the California Farm Bureau, as well as the Fresno County Farm Bureau. Although dedicated to Central Valley agri-culture, Fred Machado loved spending time with his family, especially his wife. Together, the couple have traveled to twenty-seven countries, and all fifty states. According to Fred, his most memorable trip was to South Korea where he was awarded the South Korea Veterans Peace Medal by the Ambas-sador of South Korea. Sadly, on Monday, July 9, 2018, Fred Machado passed away. Although he left us too soon, Fred made a lasting, positive impact on the people he met. Fred is survived by his wife Maxine, their three children, and six grandchildren. Fred Machado left his commu-nity of Fresno County a far richer place, and for that we are blessed. He was a loving hus-band, caring father, agricultural champion, and military veteran. There is no doubt he will be deeply missed. Mr. Speaker, today I ask my colleagues in the United States House of Representatives to join me in honoring the life of Fernando ‘‘Fred’’ C. Machado. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends during this difficult time. f

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, August 7, 2018 Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I am humbled to honor an extraordinary citizen of our South Florida community, Paul Novack. Hailing from Miami-Dade County, Paul has served as a tireless advocate and public serv-ant for those who call our slice of paradise their home. A proud graduate of my alma mater, the University of Miami (Go Canes!), Paul served as student body President among many other leadership roles. Following his undergraduate degree, Paul enrolled in Nova Southeastern University, where he earned his Juris Doc-torate. Upon completion of his law degree, Paul began his journey to what became an extraor-dinary legal career, representing thousands of clients and litigating numerous cases across multiple legal subjects. In 2016, Paul was honored by the Dade County Bar Association for significant contribu-tions in providing access to justice; an honor that is well deserved. In addition, Paul answered the Town of Surfside’s call to service, serving six terms as Town Commissioner and subsequently Mayor. During his tenure as Mayor, Paul worked to author and reform township ethics rules, and led the town to 12 consecutive balanced budg-ets. However, Paul’s commitment to public serv-ice didn’t stop there. In addition to his roles in public office, he has also held officer postings in our armed forces auxiliary; a Flotilla Staff Officer in the Coast Guard Auxiliary and a Captain in the Civil Air Patrol. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to recognize Paul’s countless hours of service and dedica-tion to our community. I thank him for his years of dedicated service, and wish him the very best in the years to come. Gracias (thank you) Paul. f 
ASSYRIAN MARTYR’S DAY 
HON. JEFF DENHAM 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, August 7, 2018 Mr. DENHAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise in rec-ognition of Assyrian Martyr’s Day. I stand with the Assyrians in my community in commemorating this solemn day—the day the Iraqi army entered Simele and its sur-rounding areas and massacred thousands of men, women, and children. We must never forget this horrific event and I hope one day we can erect a memorial in Simele for the fallen. We also recognize the 103rd anniversary of the Ottoman genocide against the Assyrians and others that began in 1915. I will continue pushing for global recognition of this genocide. Despite tragedies of the past, the Assyrian people have shown an unparalleled resolve to build a better and brighter future. Earlier this year, I introduced the Nineveh Plain Restoration Act in Congress to support the swift rehabilitation of the Nineveh Plain in the wake of war and violence. We must en-sure Assyrians have a home and a future in their ancestral homeland, and I will continue to prioritize this. Although we cannot change the past, I look forward to working with those in my commu-nity to build a strong and vibrant future for As-syrians here in America and around the world. I urge my colleagues to stand together with me in remembering those who lost their lives. May their memories continue to be with us. IN HONOR OF JOSEPH R. GILLIAM HON. J. FRENCH HILL 
OF ARKANSAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, August 7, 2018 Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Vietnam War Veteran Joseph R. Gilliam. Mr. Gilliam served in the U.S. Army from 1968 to 1969, and saw action in the Tay-Ming Province of Vietnam. There he served as an Armored Track Com-mander and as the Second Section Sergeant with the 25th Infantry Division. Mr. Gilliam earned a number of distinctions while serving, including a Bronze Star Medal for Meritorious Service and a Purple Heart for injuries sustained when his Armored Per-sonnel Carrier struck an Improvised Explosive Device. We as a Nation owe Mr. Gilliam a great debt of gratitude for his service and sacrifice. It is brave men and women like him that en-able us to rest easily at night. I’m honored to present Joseph R. Gilliam re-placement medals for his service in Vietnam and for his sacrifice to our nation.

REFLECTIONS ON THE 73RD ANNI-VERSARY OF THE BOMBINGS OF HIROSHIMA AND NAGASAKI 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, August 7, 2018 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in remembrance of the bomb-ings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki that ushered in the nuclear age 73 years ago this week. The atomic bombs that devastated Hiro-shima on August 6, 1945 and Nagasaki on August 9, 1945 thankfully represent the only instances where the awesome destructive power of nuclear weapons were unleashed. While it is true that the bombings of Hiro-shima and Nagasaki helped to bring a speedy and decisive end to the conflict in the Pacific theater during World War II, it is also true that devastation and carnage wrought by those ex-plosions was a vivid reminder and compelling reason for the international community to work in concert to prevent the proliferation and use of nuclear weapons. And for 73 years, the international commu-nity, led by the United States, has deterred every nation on earth from using nuclear weapons although it has been less successful in deterring several nation-states from devel-oping their nuclear weapons capability. So while we pause to remember the victims who perished in, and the lives that were saved by, the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, it is critically important that we take this mo-ment to redouble our commitment towards nu-clear nonproliferation and banishing the threat of nuclear annihilation from the earth. Mr. Speaker, since 1945 preventing the spread of nuclear weapons and weapons technology has been a pillar of the U.S.-led, rules-based international order that has brought an unprecedented era of peace and prosperity the United States and its allies in Europe, Asia, and the Pacific. It is this commitment to nuclear non-pro-liferation that has led the United States to

work with the international community to keep rogue nations from developing their own nu-clear arsenals, the most recent achievement in this regard is the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) negotiated with the Iranian government in 2015. Multilateral efforts like the JCPOA were made possible by responsible, level-headed leadership that did not needlessly engage in brinksmanship. Today, the world faces a grave threat from the rogue and hostile regime in Pyongyang in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. Mr. Speaker, it is imperative that we contin-ually seek to reduce the risk of war, and this is not accomplished through the use of over-heated, reckless, and bombastic rhetoric, or foolish and short-sighted actions like the cur-rent President’s decision to withdraw from the JCPOA. It is vitally important that the President learns the importance of using restrained and judicious rhetoric in trying to diffuse this deli-cate situation. Mr. Speaker, blustery statements and bom-bastic tweets will not defuse the tense situa-tion on the Korean peninsula or frighten the regime in North Korea. Instead, we must employ the full arsenal of America’s smart power assets—diplomacy, economic sanctions—to persuade North Korea that it is in its self-interest to turn away from the dangerous path it is traveling. The United States does not harbor hostile intentions toward North Korea and is seeking to overthrow the regime in Pyongyang. Mr. Speaker, thoughtful, sober, carefully calibrated diplomatic engagement with North Korea represents America’s best option and holds the promise of a favorable and peaceful outcome, just as was achieved with the JCPOA and the 1994 Agreed Framework reached with North Korea that stopped North Korea’s nuclear weapons program for nine years. On July 16, 1945, after witnessing the first test of the atomic bomb in Alamagordo, New Mexico, Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer, the direc-tor of the Manhattan Project, remembered the line from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad- Gita: ‘‘Now, I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.’’ Mr. Speaker, for more than 70 years the international community, led by the most indis-pensable of nations, the United States, has kept the nuclear genie in the bottle. We have been successful to date in no small part due to the thoughtful, persistent, ju-dicious, restrained application of American power by responsible, sober, determined, in-formed Presidents of the United States, from Harry Truman through Barack Obama. When he took the oath of office on January 20, 2017, that torch, and the burden of leader-ship, was passed to Donald Trump and all Americans are anxiously still waiting and pray-ing he can rise to the occasion.

LUIS FERNANDO SANCHEZ EARNS RANK OF EAGLE SCOUT 
HON. PETE OLSON 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, August 7, 2018 Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Luis Fernando Sanchez of Rich-mond, TX for earning the rank of Eagle Scout. Eagle Scout is the highest honor a Boy Scout can earn. Only a small percentage of Boy Scouts reach the rank of Eagle Scout, which requires years of effort to develop the necessary lead-ership, service and outdoor skills. To earn this honor, Luis earned 33 merit badges, and de-veloped and provided leadership to others in a service project. For his project, Luis con-structed a prayer and meditation area for Sa-cred Heart Family Catholic Church in Rich-mond, TX. Luis attends Travis High School and plans to study aeronautical engineering in college. His dedication to our community has prepared him to be a leader in his future ca-reer. The leadership skills he has learned through Boy Scouts are already benefiting our community. On behalf of the Twenty-Second Congres-sional District of Texas, congratulations again to Luis for becoming an Eagle Scout. I am proud and confident of his continued success. I thank him for his dedication to making our community a better place. f 
CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 5515, NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZA-TION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2019 
SPEECH OF  
HON. BRENDAN F. BOYLE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, July 26, 2018 Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I’d like to thank the FY19 NDAA conferees for their hard work on this important piece of legislation. There are many good, im-portant provisions in this bill, including several of my own amendments. However, I am here today to express my disappointment that the Senate provision which would have reinstated penalties against ZTE was stripped out of the final conference report. No nation steals American intellectual prop-erty or spies on America more than China, and Chinese telecommunication companies are among the most powerful tools they use to do this. In April 2018, the Commerce Depart-ment issued a seven-year ban on U.S. compa-nies working with ZTE due to its illegal sales to North Korea and Iran. Following President Trump’s negotiations on trade with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Secretary Wilbur Ross announced an alternative set of penalties that would allow the company to keep operating in the U.S. market. The Senate provision would have required the President to certify that Chi-nese telecoms had not violated U.S. laws and cooperated with U.S. investigators for a full year before granting relief from civil penalties. ZTE is a notorious ‘‘bad actor’’ on several policy fronts, and has blatantly violated and ig-nored U.S. law. The Chinese telecom com-pany is a consistent violator of U.S. intellectual property rights, sued multiple times by U.S. companies for intellectual property violations. The vast majority of these lawsuits have been successful. Our intellectual property laws set us apart from the rest of the world. They have been and remain critical to fostering American inno-vation. As the Administration develops its poli-cies on China and ZTE, it cannot forget that ZTE’s rogue behavior with regard to intellec-tual property is a critical element of the prob-lem and must be addressed in any solution. f 
TRIBUTE TO RINGGOLD COUNTY ISU EXTENSION AND OUTREACH 
HON. DAVID YOUNG 
OF IOWA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, August 7, 2018 Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Ringgold County ISU Extension and Outreach in Mount Ayr, Iowa on their 100-year anniversary. This is an im-portant milestone in their history of service to Southwest Iowa and the Third Congressional District. Iowa State University Extension and Out-reach began in 1862 when President Lincoln signed into the Morrill Act, which established land-grant university systems. Extension and Outreach engaged farmers and homemakers to improve seeds, farming, and home prac-tices. ISU Extension and Outreach now fo-cuses on four main topics, ag and natural re-sources, health and well-being, economic de-velopment, and youth and 4–H outreach op-portunities. Throughout its many years of service, ISU Extension and Outreach has successfully met the needs of Southwest Iowa by providing ex-cellent education for youth through 4–H and adults with necessary services to the commu-nities. I congratulate Ringgold County Exten-sion on this historic anniversary and it is an honor to represent its employees in the United States Congress. I wish them nothing but con-tinued success.

ADITYA SAHARIA EARNS RANK OF EAGLE SCOUT 
HON. PETE OLSON 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, August 7, 2018 Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Aditya Saharia of Sugar Land, TX for earning the rank of Eagle Scout. Eagle Scout is the highest honor a Boy Scout can earn. Only a small percentage of Boy Scouts reach the rank of Eagle Scout, which requires years of effort to develop the necessary lead-ership, service and outdoor skills. To earn this honor, Aditya earned 46 merit badges, and developed and provided leadership to others in a service project. For his project, Aditya worked with 12 other students to help con-struct trophy shelves for the Fort Settlement Middle School Orchestra, where he was pre-viously a member. This project took over 83 hours of Aditya’s time and the shelves he helped build covered a span of 48 feet. Aditya and his troop also completed over 100 hours of service following Hurricane Harvey. Aditya also regularly volunteers with the Sai Center of Houston, helping make food for local shel-ters. Aditya’s dedication to our community has prepared him to be a leader in his future ca-reer.

HONORING JULIA CHRISTY ON THE CELEBRATION OF HER 90TH BIRTHDAY 
HON. BLAINE LUETKEMEYER 
OF MISSOURI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, August 7, 2018 Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mrs. Julia Christy and wish her a Happy 90th Birthday. She will be celebrating this milestone on August 16, 2018. Mrs. Christy has enjoyed a rich and fulfilling life; from her childhood home of southeast Missouri to her current place of residency in O’Fallon she has been a blessing to her friends and family and loved by her commu-nity. During her time in southeast Missouri she met and married her late husband, Mr. Walter Christy. For over 60 years, they lived, laughed, and loved through the life they shared together. Mrs. Christy treasures the many nieces and nephews that are part of her life. Until her retirement, Mrs. Christy was a dedicated employee at McDonnell Douglas in St. Louis. Her parish, Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, is very appreciative of her dedicated volunteering spirit and commit-ment to the daily mass schedule. For many years, Mrs. Christy was an active member of her quilting circle. No doubt that those who re-ceived her quilts are still cherishing them to this day. Mr. Speaker, please join me in wishing Mrs. Julia Christy a very Happy 90th Birthday. Best wishes for much happiness and health in the years to come.

OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, August 7, 2018 Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and service of Edward Colston ‘‘Coley’’ Newton V, a Master Sergeant in the 101st and 82nd Airborne Divisions of the United States Army. Sgt. Newton, aged 47, passed away on July 11th in Lyells, Virginia, after an extended battle with melanoma. Before his service in the United States Army, Coley was raised in Westmoreland County in the Tidewater area of Virginia. He attended the Blue Ridge School in Charlottes-ville, as well as Ferrum College in Virginia. During his time at Ferrum, Coley was elected to the All-Prep football teams for his exem-plary offensive and defensive line skills. After college, Coley joined the United States Army as a private. He rose through the ranks to become Master Sergeant, graduated from Ranger School, and earned his Master Para-chutist Badge with the Airborne. Holding sev-eral leadership positions throughout his mili-tary career, Sgt. Newton was deployed sixteen times to Iraq and Afghanistan as a member of the Asymmetric Warfare Group and a con-tracted Operational Advisor. In May of this year, Coley was awarded the Sons of the American Revolution Heroism Award for his distinguished military service by the local Northern Neck Chapter of the SAR. Coley was an avid outdoorsman, a master marksman, and an able fisherman. He was well known for his hunting prowess as well as his angling abilities. Mr. Speaker, I ask you to join me in hon-oring and recognizing Master Sergeant New-ton for his life of service to our Common-wealth, nation, and the United States Army. f

While training, the orchestra will travel to east Asia where they will play five concerts in a two-week span performing in Taipei, Beijing, Shanghai, Seoul, and Daejeon. Aside from sharpening their musical talents, the intent of the National Youth Orchestra is to reach an intercultural dialogue, mutual under-standing, and peaceful relations with young artists in the host countries through music. I have full faith that Hannah will represent her-self and the First District of Iowa with honor.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, August 7, 2018 Mr. KINZINGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 2018 recipients of the Con-gressional Veteran Commendation in the Illi-nois 16th District. The six veterans receiving this commenda-tion have served this country honorably and fought for the freedoms we hold dearly. These veterans answered their country’s call during World War II, the Korean War, and the Viet-nam War, and they served with honor and dis-tinction. As a fellow war veteran, I thank them for their patriotism and sacrifices on behalf of our nation. After these veterans served their country, they came home to serve their communities. They are civic leaders, active citizens, and many continue to serve their military brothers and sisters through veteran service organiza-tions. Although their mission has changed since returning to civilian life, their leadership and tenacity have not. The recipients of the 2018 Congressional Veteran Commendation are: Cpt Michael Ebert of Morris, IL; Sgt Francis Killelea of Ot-tawa, IL; Engineman First Class Clifford Parker of Ottawa, IL; Specialist William (Bill) Phillips of LaMoille, IL; Master Sgt Eugene Thompson of Marseilles, IL; and Seaman Low-ell Wagner of Belvidere, IL.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, August 7, 2018 Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and remember the life of Ken Roos, the beloved first vice president of SEIU Local 1984 in New Hamp-shire. A passionate activist, humanitarian, and volunteer, Ken was known to love a good pro-test and dedicated himself to social and eco-nomic justice through countless amounts of service to help hardworking Granite State men and women. Through his career in public service, Ken promoted the health, safety, and well-being of the citizens of New Hampshire. His volunteer work with the Red Cross improved families’ lives after difficult times such as 9/11, New Hampshire home fires, and Hurricane Katrina. Ken literally gave a part of himself to those whose lives he touched, donating hundreds of pints of blood throughout his life. Ken was a staunch advocate for working families and or-ganized labor, advocating for many whose voices didn’t always have a seat at the table. On behalf of people across New Hamp-shire’s Second Congressional District, I ex-press my profound gratitude for Ken and his many years of devoted service to the Granite State. He will be greatly missed, but his mem-ory will live on through the kindness of every-one he touched and the lasting impact of the causes for which he fought.

As one of the oldest Ruritan clubs in the country, this chapter has worked relentlessly to respond to the needs of their community and our nation. From preparing members for service in World War II to recent efforts sup-porting the DARE education program and Project Lifesaver corporation, the King William Ruritan Club has stayed active in meeting the needs of their local community and the nation. The King William Ruritan Club has also contin-ued to serve and support the King William Emergency Ministries, ensuring that their fel-low citizens who are struggling financially con-tinue to have the utilities they and their fami-lies need. Having donated well over $400,000 back to King William, VA throughout their his-tory, the King William Ruritan Club has played an indispensable leadership role in the pro-motion of philanthropic activities. In addition to volunteer services, the club hosts events that bring the community to-gether such as their annual ‘‘Fish Fry’’ fund-raiser. This tradition started in the 1940s and is sponsored by local businesses. Guests enjoy local seafood while contributing to a great cause. Throughout the year they host town meetings where citizens can interact with law enforcement resulting in a safer and stronger community. The King William County Ruritan Club promotes values such as civility and charitableness which are vital to the health of our great democracy. Their goal is simple yet far-reaching: To make King William a better place to live and work. They continue to accomplish this mission as they approach their 80th year and I thank them for their serv-ice.

Kendra is one of just 86 court clerks in Texas to earn the certification. She pre-viously earned her Certified Court Clerk I and II certifications which are academically rig-orous and both require 40 hours of education and a three-part exam. Certified court clerks, such as Kendra, are extremely valuable to municipal courts in Texas and help ensure de-fendants receive due process and proper legal opinions. On behalf of the Twenty-Second Congres-sional District of Texas, congratulations again to Kendra Beverly for being awarded Certified Municipal Court Clerk Certification. I thank her for her dedication to the rule of law.

TRIBUTE TO SANDRA AND CARL LEE 
HON. DAVID YOUNG 
OF IOWA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, August 7, 2018 Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor Sandra and Carl Lee of Clarinda, Iowa on the very special oc-casion of their 50th wedding anniversary. They were married on June 28, 1968 at the United Methodist Church in New Market, Iowa. Sandra and Carl’s lifelong commitment to each other and their family truly embodies Iowa values. As they reflect on their 50th anni-versary, I hope it is filled with happy memo-ries. May their commitment grow even strong-er, as they continue to love, cherish, and honor one another for many years to come. Mr. Speaker, I commend this great couple on their 50th year together and I wish them many more. I ask that my colleagues in the United States House of Representatives join me in congratulating them on this momentous occasion. f 
GUN VIOLENCE 
HON. ROBIN L. KELLY 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, August 7, 2018 Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today because gun violence claims the lives of more than 90 Americans every day while hun-dreds of others are injured, many perma-nently. Despite these stark and shocking statistics, this Congress has not held a single vote to prevent gun violence—even though polling shows that more than 90 percent of Ameri-cans support commonsense, lifesaving policy changes, like a background check on every gun sale. Mr. Speaker, we—this Republican-controlled Congress—are failing American families by re-fusing to act and protect their lives. Here are the names of many, many Ameri-cans that we’ve failed. Americans failed by a Congress too be-holden to the NRA to act:

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, August 7, 2018 Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Lee Vela of Sugar Land, TX, for re-ceiving the Public Relations Society of Amer-ica (PRSA) Houston Legacy Award. PRSA awarded Lee this prestigious honor at its annual Excalibur Awards program. The Legacy Award is given to individuals who have 25 years of experience in public relations and demonstrate a strong sense of leadership and expertise in the field, showcasing a lifetime of achievement in public relations. Lee serves as Vice President of Public Affairs for the Hous-ton region of Clear Channel Outdoor. He pre-viously served as Chief Communications Offi-cer for Houston Independent School district and the Port of Houston Authority. Lee’s lead-ership at Clear Channel Outdoor was critical to the development of the ‘‘Gulf Coast Emer-gency Communications Network,’’ which helped save lives during Hurricane Harvey by displaying emergency messages on company billboards. He is the chairman of the Fire Fighters Foundation of Houston and President of the Outdoor Advertising Association of Texas. Lee has also been a PRSA member since 1986 and is the past president of the Houston PRSA chapter. On behalf of the Twenty-Second Congres-sional District of Texas, congratulations again to Lee Vela on receiving the PRSA Houston Legacy Award. His work brings great pride to TX–22. I thank him.

HONORING MOVING FORWARDS TOWARDS INDEPENDENCE 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, August 7, 2018 Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 20th anniversary of the founding of Moving Forward Towards Independence, an organization that provides adults with intellectual disabilities the skills needed to live and work independently. Moving Forward Towards Independence was founded in 1998 by a group of parents. This group created a unique transitional hous-ing program that assists young adults with in-tellectual and high functioning Autism Spec-trum Disabilities. Moving Forward Towards Independence offers structured on-campus group housing, apartment living near campus and off-campus community living. Moving For-ward Towards Independence provides class-es, social activities and individual case man-agement services to its clients to assist them in maintaining friendships, relationships and employment. Moving Forward Towards Independence has had hundreds of adults, ages 18 to 37, partici-pate in its program. Residents are from all over the country and come to Moving Forward Towards Independence with the goal of even-tually being able to live independently with minimal support. Moving Forward Towards Independence is an integral part of our community. It is active in the Center for Volunteer and Nonprofit Leadership and is a member of the Napa Chamber of Commerce. The organization reg-ularly meets with the Napa Valley Community Organizations Active in Disaster for disaster relief preparedness. Moving Forward Towards Independence is a strong supporter of the Napa Special Olympics and partners with the Napa College Disability Services Unit. The or-ganization is also an active member of the Disability Committee to the Napa Nonprofits Coalition. Mr. Speaker, Moving Forward Towards Independence is a great contributor to our Napa Valley community. It is therefore fitting and proper that we honor Moving Forward To-wards Independence here today. f

OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, August 7, 2018 Mr. L
AMALFA. Mr. Speaker I rise today to honor the life of a local community leader and retired Chief of Police, Robert Franklin Pasero. Bob Pasero was always an active member in the community of Orland. I had the privilege of meeting Bob when he was serving as the Orland Chief of Police from 2004 to 2010, and upon his retirement celebration. Bob was a role model for many in the City of Orland be-cause of his interactions and care for the peo-ple around him and the good humor he brought with it. As the Chief of Police, he al-ways led people in the right direction with his fatherly attitude and compassion. Bob was re-spected and loved by the people around him.

You would also find Bob doing the announc-ing at the local Glenn County Fair parade each year, having something encouraging to say about each entry as he knew just about each one personally. After Bob retired as Chief of Police, he did not let that stop him from serving his town. He wanted to honor those who served our country so he assisted in facilitating the Motor-Icicle Run in honor of Orland’s veterans. As a minister of his church, Victory in Christ Community Church, Bob mentored and mar-ried many young couples. Bob also organized events for his church such as the Annual Soup Bowl where once a year he and his church would make and serve food to the homeless in the community. Bob also had a passion for music and used his talent to serve God as the leader of the Victory in Christ Community Church worship band. Bob count-ed himself as a ‘‘prayer warrior’’ constantly asking for prayer through social media and personally for people he knew of in need, touching many lives with his strong faith . Bob Pasero passed away on July 25, 2018 after a hard fought battle with cancer. He will always be remembered by his family and neighbors for his contagious love for life and for others that he so gladly served. Mr. Speaker, please join me in honoring Robert Franklin Pasero for his commitment and service to the community of Orland.

ALEXIS PAGET RECEIVES LEU-KEMIA AND LYMPHOMA SOCIETY HERO AWARD 
HON. PETE OLSON 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, August 7, 2018 Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Alexis Paget of Missouri City, TX, for receiving the Hero Award from the Leu-kemia and Lymphoma Society. Alexis, a 16 year old student at Ridge Point High School, won the national award for her fundraising efforts during the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society’s Texas Gulf Coast Chap-ter’s 2018 Students of the Year campaign. Alexis raised over $61,000 with her fund-raising team and her class brought in over $350,000 to fight blood cancer. This funding is then distributed by the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society to over 1.3 million blood cancer patients in the U.S. Paget ran her cam-paign in honor of her grandfather, who lost his battle to Acute Myeloid Leukemia. On behalf of the Twenty-Second Congres-sional District of Texas, congratulations again to Alexis Paget for receiving the Hero Award from the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society. I thank her for her dedication to creating a world without blood cancer.

IN RECOGNITION OF CONNIE JACKSON 
HON. JACKIE SPEIER 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, August 7, 2018 Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Connie Jackson, an extraordinary public serv-ant and tireless advocate for residents for her 15 years as the City Manager for the City of San Bruno, California. She has left her mark on just about every square inch of this Penin-sula city of 43,000 people. I have had the great honor to work with Connie during the best and the worst of times. Her moral com-pass guides her and she is never afraid to take on challenges. I am proud to call Connie Jackson a colleague and good friend. Under Connie’s capable leadership, San Bruno has not only survived the Great Reces-sion of 2008, it came out stronger on the other side. All city programs and services were in-tact, the city was financially stronger, and it earned an AA+ credit rating. Connie oversaw San Bruno’s completion of an updated Gen-eral Plan and helped create a long-term vision for a city friendly to residents and businesses. She is particularly proud of the redevelopment of a former Navy site into a housing complex called Village at the Crossing, which provides over 1,000 apartments for individuals and fam-ilies, including affordable units for senior citi-zens. She was also instrumental in the rede-velopment of The Shops at Tanforan, a large shopping mall frequented by shoppers and diners from all over the Bay Area. For over a decade, Connie worked on the planning, design and construction of the CalTrain grade separation and station, offering commuters access to convenient public trans-portation. Connie oversaw the rebuilding of the entire aging water and wastewater infrastruc-ture, and the building of mixed-use residential and commercial projects downtown and along El Camino Real. One of the elements to her success is her talent to connect the dots and collaborate with other individuals and agen-cies. The ultimate test of her leadership came on September 9, 2010. At 6:11 p.m. that evening, a Pacific Gas and Electric Company natural gas transmission line exploded and tore a giant crater into one of the residential streets. The horrendous explosion and fire killed eight residents, destroyed 38 homes and dev-astated a neighborhood. Connie, along with other city leaders, fought with everything she had to heal the physical and psychological trauma her community suffered. I closely worked with Connie in the years following the explosion and she never wavered or was afraid to speak truth to power. She dem-onstrated strong leadership in the initial emer-gency response, community and recovery ef-forts, and pipeline safety advocacy. She led the city’s work with the National Transportation Safety Board investigation and the pro-ceedings before the California Public Utilities Commission. Connie and her colleagues were instrumental in exposing regulatory failures and corruption and in forcing corrections. Due to that work, cities all across the country have safer, improved gas utility infrastructure. Connie was also a consoler throughout the crisis. She offered her shoulder to cry on, her hugs to comfort, her smile to reassure, and her wisdom to move forward. To this day, she has regular contact with survivors. While nothing will bring back the eight vic-tims of the San Bruno explosion, PG&E was forced to give $120 million to the city for com-munity restoration, recovery and restitution. Being the community-loving and resilient city that San Bruno is, the residents decided they wanted to spend the money benefitting all residents. The city will build a new recreation center and aquatics center for everyone in San Bruno to enjoy. Connie’s talents and achievements have been recognized on many occasions. For ex-ample, she received the 2012 League of Cali-fornia Cities City Manager of Distinction award, the California Women Leading Govern-ment Leadership Award, and the 2006 Inter-national City/County Management Association program innovation award. She is a life mem-ber of the Municipal Management Assistants of Northern California and a member of ICMA. Before serving San Bruno, Connie was the city manager of the City of Hercules and the City of Fort Bragg for a combined 18 years. Mr. Speaker, I ask the House of Represent-atives to rise with me to recognize Connie Jackson, a woman and leader I hold in high esteem, for her vision, strength and persever-ance fighting for the interests of the residents of three California cities. She can enter her well-deserved retirement knowing that she has improved the lives of tens of thousands of people. San Bruno residents are lucky to count themselves among them. Connie leaves behind giant shoes to fill. Many will lead San Bruno through the next decades, but no one will leave a legacy that echoes across the generations. This will be the unique contribu-tion of Connie Jackson. f

Mr. Speaker, today I rise to remember the life of Dr. Russell Platt, age 91, who passed away on August 2, 2018 in Akron, Ohio. Dr. Platt was the first African- American doctor to finish his residency at Akron City Hospital, and he was one of the first African-American doctors in Akron to have an integrated medical practice. His story is truly inspiring. Dr. Platt was born on July 10, 1927 in Latta, South Carolina to Francis and Carlie Platt. He

attended Dillon County Training School, an unaccredited school in Latta for Negroes. He finished his high school education at Voorhees Preparatory School before going to South Carolina State University. There, he studied from 1945 until 1949, majoring in biology and secondary education and minoring in chem-istry. Later, Dr. Platt received his master’s de-gree in education from The Ohio State Univer-sity. Upon graduation, he served in the newly integrated United States Air Force. He studied aviation physiology and quickly rose to the rank of 2nd Lieutenant in Aviation Medicine. In 1960, he graduated and received his medical degree from Meharry Medical College in Nashville, Tennessee. After graduating, Dr. Platt moved to Akron, Ohio with his soulmate Barbara to train as a doctor. He knew he would be unable to be a doctor if he remained in South Carolina. Rus-sell resided in Akron for 58 years, practicing medicine there for 51 of those years. Through the course of his career it is estimated that Platt has cared for over 25,000 patients and frequently handed out his personal cellphone number for after-hour emergencies. He was beloved by the community for his service; be-lieving that his work was a calling rather than simply a career. Beyond his own practice, Dr. Platt was a proud member of The American Medical Asso-ciation, The Ohio State Medical Association, The Summit County Medical Association, The American Society of Internal Medicine, and The National Medical Association. He received many honors and accolades through the years. Most recently, Summa Health estab-lished the Russell Platt Clerkship, collecting over $10,000 for medical residents. He was selected for the prestigious Crain’s Magazine ‘‘Eight over Eighty.’’ He was also featured in an article in the Akron Beacon Journal, ‘‘Pio-neering Black Doctor Living his calling at 89.’’ But above all, Dr. Platt was dedicated to his wife and six children. A true family man, he cherished the time spent with them. He is quoted as saying, ‘‘You can’t go back. Take care of those kids while you can—go to their concerts, take them to piano lessons, take them to shows.’’ He and his wife Barbara, who passed away in 2012, are survived by six chil-dren, Michael and Russell Platt Jr., Pamela Potts, Deborah Watters, Renee, Kimberly, and ten grandchildren to carry on their memory. Dr. Russell Platt will leave a lasting impact, and I know he is dearly missed by his family and the greater community of Akron. I extend my deepest and sincerest condolences.

OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, August 7, 2018 Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Plantation at Quail Valley in Missouri City, for being named Senior Living Community of the Year. Plantation at Quail Valley in Missouri City was named Senior Living Community of the Year by the Houston Apartment Association (HAA). Each year, HAA presents awards to different properties located within its 12 county membership area. Receiving this award is a prestigious honor for Plantation at Quail Val-ley, not only locally but also brings much statewide and national recognition. This senior living community is state of the art and is greatly valued by the residents of Missouri City.

Thanks for helping make Missouri City a wonderful place to live. f 
THE SPANISH FLAG LOWERED FOR THE FINAL TIME ON TEXAS SOIL 
HON. TED POE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, August 7, 2018 Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the day was July 21, 1821. The heat of the Texas summer sun beat down upon San Antonio de Bexar, the future site of the Battle of the Alamo. The flag of Imperial Spain billowed in the wind above the roofs of the mission town. This day, however, would be the final day that this flag would fly over Texas. For nearly three centuries, the Spanish gov-erned Texas. Conquistadores, missionaries, and adventurers made their way to Texas, drawn in by the bountiful opportunities of the seemingly endless land. However, resistance against Spanish rule began to take root within its overseas colonies. In Texas, filibusters from the United States crossed into Spanish territory attempting to claim land loosely con-trolled by Spanish royal forces. Mexico caught the fever of revolution, and by the early 1800’s, certain individuals, including Father Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, were promoting re-sistance to aspects of Spanish rule. To make matters worse, Spain was forced to cede Louisiana as a result of the Napole-onic Wars at home to France, who then sold it to President Thomas Jefferson and the United States. Eventually, the pressure became too great from within, and the Mexican war of Independ-ence began in 1810. Revolutionaries, both Hispanic and Anglos, living across Spanish Mexico took up arms in open revolt against the Spanish occupiers. In Texas, Jose Bernardo Gutierrez de Lara and Augustus W. Magee captured Nacodoches, La Bahia, and San Antonio, the capital of Spanish Texas at the time, and proclaimed Texas an inde-pendent state in 1813. Despite their early suc-cess, the group eventually was defeated deci-sively by Spanish forces, thus keeping Texas under Spain’s control. However, the days of Spanish rule were numbered, and eventually the independence movement in Mexico under Agustin de lturbide and Vicente Guerrero successfully drove the Spanish from Mexican shores once and for all. Mexico would officially become an inde-pendent nation on July 21, 1821. Having pro-vided resistance against Spanish rule, Texas remained a part of an independent Mexico until the Texas Revolution fifteen years later. Mr. Speaker, we must continue to honor the state’s history. The Spanish flag is one of the Six Flags over Texas, part of the rich tapestry of the state’s history, and this event rep-resents an important moment in the history of our nation. And that is just the way it is. f 
HONORING THE SERVICE OF SERGEANT JAMES (JIMMY) RIZZO 
HON. LEE M. ZELDIN 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, August 7, 2018 Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor the service an sacrifice of James (Jimmy) Rizzo. Growmg up in Brooklyn, New York, in the shadow of the Brooklyn Navy Yard, his draft notice arrived in 1942. Mr. Rizzo was sent to Camp Crowder in Neosho, Missouri for basic training, and upon comple-tion of his training, he was assigned to the 96th Battalion and transferred to Louisiana. In 1943, he arrived in the Burmese theater, where he would be stationed to serve. Mr. Rizzo was constantly on the move in Burma. His duty was retrieving supplies and packages by airdrop from dangerous jungles and ter-rains, ensuring these supplies arrived at their military and medical destinations on time and intact. The job was a dangerous one, and dur-ing his time in Burma he faced two near-death situations. Having been promoted from Private to Cor-poral and then to Sergeant, he was awarded the African and Burma Stars. For his service and sacrifice, our nation will always be in-debted to Sergeant Rizzo, and his bravery and selflessness then and now continues to inspire us all.

TRIBUTE TO MARLENE AND LARRY HUMMEL 
HON. DAVID YOUNG 
OF IOWA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, August 7, 2018 Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor Marlene and Larry Hummel of Atlantic, Iowa on the very special occasion of their 55th wedding anni-versary. They were married on June 16, 1963 at Oakland United Methodist Church in Oak-land, Iowa. Marlene and Larry’s lifelong commitment to each other and their family truly embodies Iowa values. As they reflect on their 55th anni-versary, I hope it is filled with happy memo-ries. May their commitment grow even strong-er, as they continue to love, cherish, and honor one another for many years to come. Mr. Speaker, I commend this great couple on their 55th year together and I wish them many more. I ask that my colleagues in the United States House of Representatives join me in congratulating them on this momentous occasion.

GUN VIOLENCE 
HON. ROBIN L. KELLY 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, August 7, 2018 Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today because gun violence continues to claim the lives of Americans and it remains un-checked by this Congress. Just this weekend, Chicago—our nation’s third largest city—saw 74 people shot, 11 of whom passed away and 63 of whom were in-jured and will never be the same. Mr. Speaker, what are we doing? Or more correctly, what AREN’T we doing? We should be passing legislation to stop interstate gun trafficking, to prevent stalkers from accessing weapons, to keep suspected terrorists from purchasing weapons and to en-sure a background check on every gun sale. Tragically, this Republican-controlled Con-gress shows no intention to consider any of these commonsense, lifesaving policy changes that we know work and save lives. Mr. Speaker, we—well, more correctly, this Republican-controlled Congress is failing the American people and putting their lives and families at risk. Here are the names of many, many Ameri-cans that we’ve failed . Americans failed by a Congress too be-holden the NRA to act:
