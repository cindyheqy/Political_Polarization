IN HONOR OF THE FALLEN HE-ROES OF OPERATION RED WINGS 
HON. KEVIN BRADY 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 29, 2018 Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to honor the memory and sacrifice of the nineteen heroes who gave their lives thirteen years ago in Operation Red Wings. On June 28, 2005, four members of Navy SEAL Team 10—Danny Dietz, Matthew Axelson, Marcus Luttrell, and Michael P. Mur-phy—were tasked with killing or capturing the high-ranking Taliban official, Ahmad Shah, in the Hindu-Kush Mountains of Afghanistan. Shortly after encountering a small group of Afghani goat herders, hostile Taliban forces discovered the SEALs’ presence and began converging on their position. An intense fire-fight ensued, in which three of the four SEALs tragically lost their lives. Responding to the battle, an MH–47 Chi-nook helicopter and the 160th Special Oper-ations Aviation’s Regiment ‘‘Nightstalkers’’ were dispatched to rescue the team—only to be shot down by Taliban forces armed with an RPG. As a result, all sixteen men on board the Chinook—Chris J. Scherkenbach, Corey J. Goodnature, Daniel R. Healy, Erik S. Kristensen, Jacques J. Fontan, James E. Suh, James W. Ponder III, Jeffery A. Lucas, Jeffrey S. Taylor, Kip A. Jacoby, Marcus V. Muralles, Michael L. Russell, Michael M. McGreevy, Jr., Shamus O. Goare, Shane E. Patton, Stephen C. Reich—were killed. The lone survivor of the mission, Marcus Luttrell, lives on to share the amazing story of the mission and the heroic actions that took place. Tragically, nineteen brave heroes made the ultimate sacrifice in the service of their country during Operation Red Wings. They selflessly fulfilled their duty and defended our Nation in a time of war, and it is our responsibility to preserve the memory of their sacrifice. Their steadfast service, dedication to country, and the honorable sacrifices they made will never be forgotten. They stood where duty required them to stand, and we are forever grateful for their selflessness. These men continue to inspire their friends, families, loved ones, and the millions of peo-ple around the world who hear the story of their heroic actions. I am privileged to recog-nize and honor the service of these American heroes who laid down their lives for our great Nation. CONGRATULATING KATIE MILLER ON BEING NAMED 2018 OUT-STANDING JUNIOR BY THE ILLI-NOIS BEEF ASSOCIATION HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 29, 2018 Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Katie Miller of Cambridge, Illinois, who was named the 2018 Outstanding Junior of the Year by the Illinois Beef Association. Katie Miller has excelled on campus at Western Illinois University, where she recently completed her junior year. Her studies in agri-cultural sciences with an emphasis on animal science were inspired by the time she spent alongside her grandparents working with beef producers. Following the completion of her un-dergraduate work, she plans to pursue a grad-uate degree in ruminant nutrition or meat science, while partnering on the farm with her grandparents. Outside of the classroom, Ms. Miller is the Vice President of the Illinois Jun-ior Beef Association Board and has held var-ious other local and state leadership positions with the Illinois Beef Association further dem-onstrating her qualifications for this award. It is because of dedicated citizens like Katie Miller that I proudly serve the people of the 17th District of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I would like to formally congratulate Katie Miller on her outstanding achievement and journey into ag-ricultural science.

HONORING VIETNAM WAR VET-ERANS FROM CORNING PAINTED POST EAST AND WEST HIGH SCHOOL 
HON. TOM REED 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 29, 2018 Mr. REED. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Vietnam War veterans from the Cor-ning Painted Post East and West High School Class of 1968. Nine million Americans, ap-proximately 7.2 million living today, served on active duty in the U.S. Armed Forces during the United States involvement in Vietnam be-tween November 1, 1955 and May 7, 1975. When they returned home, our soldiers faced a hostile political climate and received less than a welcome home. These men and women deserve the recognition due for being among the 1.3% of veterans who have served their country honorably in time of war. Between Painted Post East High School and Painted Post West High School, more than sixty brave men from the graduating class of 1968 served in our military during the Vietnam War. These men answered the call to duty and served their country honorably, yet when they returned home they received little for a welcome home. As the Corning Painted Post East and West High School Class of 1968 gathers after more than forty-five years to officially welcome these men home, I would like to recognize them for their service to our nation. Serving in the Army: Robert Brooder, Kent DeCamp, Bill Kane, Francis Killigrew, Michael Wilcox, Patrick Boland, Tom Bosket, Nicholas Cavallaro, Larry Cleveland, Herman DeMonstoy, Ron Faulisi, Joseph Ferratella, Mark Howell, Joseph Kosty, Joseph Maglioca, Fred Panyard, Philip Spart, Joseph Stamilio, Charles Stebbins, Lew Tyler, and Alan Van Etten. Serving in the Navy: Donald Twist, Walter Delap, Robert Kent, Larry Ketchum, Alan Lam-bert, Gary Moshier, David Scott, and Preston Perry. Serving in the Air Force: George Audinwood, Ford Butler, Craig Burrell, Ray Copp, Jessie Glosser, Daniel Henyan, and Bobby Preset. Serving in the Marines: Dana Eckel, Michael Horvat, and Kent Rawcliffe. Serving the Department of Defense: Doug-las Taft.

He has participated in countless successful missions, including the manhunt for the Dannemora prison escapees in 2015. In addi-tion to his patrol duties, Agent Perry gave back to his unit by serving as an instructor pilot, passing on his skills and expertise to the next generation of pilots. A true public servant, Agent Perry served in the U.S. Marine Corps for four years before his career with U.S. Cus-toms and Border Protection. He has given so much to this country, and his lifelong service is truly admirable. On behalf of New York’s 21st district, I would like to thank Agent Perry for his years of hard work. He has shown true dedication to his community and country, and I wish him all the best in the years ahead.

TRIBUTE TO JOHN HALL ON THE OCCASION OF HIS RETIREMENT FROM THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOP-MENT 
HON. SUSAN W. BROOKS 
OF INDIANA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 29, 2018 Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor my friend, beloved and iconic member of the Hoosier community, John Hall, who is retiring as the Indianapolis Field Office Director for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development in Indiana (HUD). During his time at HUD, John worked tirelessly to improve the living conditions, neighborhoods, and quality of life for residents across the State of Indiana. The people of In-diana’s Fifth Congressional District are forever grateful for John’s contributions to our Hoosier community, and it is my privilege to honor him today. A native Hoosier, John was raised in Indian-apolis where he attended Shortridge High School and later graduated from Ball State University with a Bachelor’s of Social Science. After earning his undergraduate degree, John pursued graduate studies at both Indiana Uni-versity-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) and DePauw University. He then began his career teaching history and government at Ar-senal Technical High School. Passionate about community youth, John coached fresh-man track and was the trainer for the Arsenal Tech sports program. Dedicated to making a difference through education, John directed the Minority Engineering Advancement Pro-gram (MEAP) and later became an adminis-trator at the Purdue University School of Engi-neering and Technology at IUPUI. In addition to his career in education, John served as a senior aide to Senator Richard Lugar for 15 years. Under Senator Lugar, he managed a vast portfolio of issues, including education, economic development, small busi-ness, and special projects. As Assistant State Director, John worked with key Indiana staff members on domestic and international issues, specifically focusing on African affairs. He later served as Deputy Mayor of Indianap-olis for three years under Mayor Stephen Goldsmith. Under his leadership, John helped facilitate the Mayor’s education forums, the Front Porch Alliance, faith-based initiative, welfare-to-work initiative, small and minority business development, affordable housing, and inner city retail and race relations issues. During my time as Deputy Mayor of Indianap-olis, I had the unique opportunity to work side by side with John to help lead our city. A true public servant, John then became the Director of Neighborhood Relations for the Health and Hospital Corporation of Marion County in 2000. In 2002 John became the first African-Amer-ican Indianapolis Field Office Director in the history of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. As Field Office Director, John met with various mayors, housing au-thority executives, and community develop-ment professionals throughout the State of In-diana. His communication skills and deep ex-perience were instrumental in gaining a better understanding of the strengths and challenges presented in communities across the state of Indiana. Personal knowledge of neighborhood issues allowed him to understand the impor-tance of a safe, stable living environment, with available opportunities for home ownership. Responsible for leading the Indianapolis field office and offices in Gary, Indiana, John oversaw over 87 HUD employees. Under his leadership, the Indianapolis office encouraged homeownership, refinanced FHA mortgages for affordable housing, and doubled its home-ownership outreach, especially among minori-ties. This led to administering more than 460 million in grant dollars across Indiana commu-nities. John’s impact on his community goes far beyond his work at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, as evi-denced by his service on the boards of the Fund for Hoosier Excellence, the Greater Indi-anapolis Progress Committee, and the Greater Indianapolis Health Foundation. He also served as a chairman for the Greater Indy Neighborhoods Initiative, Co-Chair of the Civic Engagement segment of the Community Revi-talization Summit, Trustee of the Indianapolis Building Authority, and member of the Marion County Sheriff’s Merit Board and Indianapolis Human Rights Commission. A man of faith, John currently serves as the Staff Parish Team Leader at Barnes United Methodist Church in Indianapolis. In the public and private sector, John has been honored with numerous awards. He no-tably received the 2007 Outstanding Black Alumnus from Ball State University, the 2006 Award for Public Service from the Indiana Black Expo, the 2005 President’s Award from Ball State University’s Black Alumni Con-stituent Society, and the award for Excellence in Public Health from Indiana’s State Health Commissioner in 2004. He was also honored with the Ball State Benny Award in 2004, Drum Major Award in Community Service by the Circle City Frontiers of Indianapolis in 2000, and the Achievement in Public Service Award by the Center for Leadership Develop-ment in 1997. John has made a remarkable impression on his community and the lives of his friends, family, and colleagues. He has truly left a leg-acy of service at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and beyond that will be built upon for years to come. On behalf of Indiana’s Fifth Congressional District, I would like to congratulate John Hall on his extraordinary career and extend my gratitude for all the wonderful contributions he has made to our Hoosier community. While I know John will be missed at HUD, I wish the very best to him, his two sons and the rest of his family as he enjoys a well-deserved retire-ment. f 
TRIBUTE IN HONOR OF DR. ROB-ERT BROWNING’S RETIREMENT 
HON. HAROLD ROGERS 
OF KENTUCKY  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 29, 2018 Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate my friend and trust-ed spiritual advisor, Dr. Robert ‘‘Bob’’ Brown-ing, Pastor of First Baptist Church in Frankfort, Kentucky, upon his retirement after dedicating his life to nearly 50 years of faithful ministry. My bride, Cynthia, and I were honored to have Dr. Browning officiate our wedding in 1999. He blessed the beginning of our mar-riage with an eloquent ceremony about the un-matched value of love, devotion and thanks-giving. We have held his words close to our hearts each day and uphold Dr. Browning with the highest esteem. He was also my beloved Pastor at the Som-erset First Baptist Church, where he served our community for 16 years. Dr. Browning shared the Word of God with great boldness, discipling young Christians and shepherding his flock with enduring wisdom. I have always been inspired by his passion to serve and share the Gospel of Jesus. Just as the Bible instructs us to do, Dr. Browning has cared for the widows and the poor, visited the sick, mourned with the broken-hearted, and rejoiced with those in times of celebration. Dr. Browning was licensed and ordained to the Gospel Ministry by the First Baptist Church of Greenville after diligently studying at The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Lou-isville. While most of his ministry was dedi-cated in the Commonwealth of Kentucky, he also ministered in Atlanta, Georgia for 13 years. From 1994 to 1995, he served as President of the Kentucky Baptist Convention. As noted in his biography, ‘‘Dr. Browning is proud of his Baptist heritage and works with other Baptists through the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship to spread the Gospel, build bridges of goodwill and understanding among all peo-ple, promote the cause of justice and meet the needs of those who are struggling.’’ He and his wife, Jackie, have been a tre-mendous blessing to families and individuals across Kentucky, and I extend my deepest gratitude for their friendship and counsel over the years. As they enter into retirement, Cyn-thia and I pray the years ahead are filled with exceeding peace and joy along with their three children and five grandchildren.

HON. ANN M. KUSTER 
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 29, 2018 Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the retire-ment of the Honorable Judge Thomas A. Rappa, Jr. and to thank him for his dedicated services to the New Hampshire Judicial Branch and the people of New Hampshire for the past 30 years. After graduating from Franklin Pierce Law Center in 1986, Judge Rappa began a long career in the New Hampshire judicial system. He first worked for the Honorable Karl T. Bruckner in Woodsville, New Hampshire be-fore taking on his own practice. As a lawyer, Judge Rappa served the people of New Hampshire in his work on the interdisciplinary coordinating council for domestic violence, in teaching legal and paralegal classes at Plym-outh State College and in the College for Life Long Learning, and in instituting a Teen Court in his Plymouth, New Hampshire court. He also served for six years on the Pro Bono Ad-visory Board, where he received the L. Jona-than Ross Award in 1989, and on the Board of Governors from 1991 to 1993. Throughout his impressive tenure, Judge Rappa has truly been a leader in his commu-nity and the Granite State as a whole, dem-onstrating the compassion, wisdom, and fair-ness that is the hallmark of a great judge. I am proud to rise today in acknowledgement of his achievements and wish him the best upon his retirement.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 29, 2018 Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and congratulate Agent Brad Chambers on his retirement after 20 years of service in U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

After serving in the military, he continued his passion for protecting Ameri-cans by working tirelessly for U.S. Customs and Border Protection, occupying positions of instructor training pilot, Air-Marine Operator, and Air Interdiction Pilot. Agent Chambers also was the Founder and one of the Chief Advisers for Law Enforcement Explorers Post 2100, a group that mentors high school and college students considering a career in law enforcement or the military, which highlights Agent Chambers’ lifelong commitment to edu-cating and protecting Americans. On behalf of New York’s 21st district, I would like to thank Agent Brad Chambers for his years of hard work and service to the pub-lic, and wish him all the best in the years ahead.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 29, 2018 Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember Juan Jose´Pen˜a, who passed away this month at the age of 72.

Mr. Pen˜a was drafted into the Army in 1969 and went on to receive a multitude of decora-tions including a Bronze Star Medal for Valor. He was the most decorated member of the Fourth Infantry Division when it returned to the United States. After serving our nation, Mr. Pen˜a became a Spanish Professor at New Mexico Highlands University in Las Vegas. He went on to work as a supervisory interpreter at the United States District Court in Albuquerque for more than two decades. Mr. Pen˜a continued to work as a freelance interpreter after he retired.

He was a lead-er in Partido Raza Unida, Commander of the Albuquerque and New Mexico branches of the American GI Forum, Chairman of the Hispano Round Table, and founding member of Dads Against Discrimination.

HONORING LENORE KARLIN

Birthday and enjoy the story of ‘‘A Life Well Lived.’’ 
LENORE KARLIN —100 Y EARS  What is a life well lived? Lenore Karlin ex-emplifies 100 well spent years. Lenore was the first child born to Rose Wolf Gardner and Louis Gardner on April 25, 1918. Louis, a mite senior to his darling bride, Rose, couldn’t have been happier. There were days when Mr. Gardner took baby in pram (decorated with American flags), paraded them down the street and placed Lenore in pram in his Kingston street Boston storefront window for the world to see. Louis, an immigrant, was a great pa-triot. Two more children, Helene and Herbert fol-lowed. Louis, a shoe importer, took Rose and the children to Europe often for business and his great love, the opera. Whilst Rose and Louis enjoyed the Wagner ring in Beirut, Le-nore, Helene and Herbert were tended by a nursemaid in Czechoslovakia. These were magical voyages across the At-lantic Ocean. The children had a trunk just for toys. Lenore’s father took them to fac-tories where linens and China (perhaps even the teacups today) were crafted, as he was a collector of these fineries. They would return with cases of shoes and finery. Morris Wolf, Lenore’s grandfather on her mother’s side was a well-respected detective for the Boston police, in fact the first Jewish one. He chased criminals around the globe. Lenore remembers as a child walking down the street with her grandfather who would don a prominent hat, and when they passed the mayor of Boston, in a gesture of respect, the mayor would tip his hat to Morris. Lenore was an excellent student at Girl’s Latin School. She excelled in all subjects. Unfortunately her father became ill when she was quite young and died when she was but 15 years old. But Lenore carried the firm foundation he planted with her: his ever- present optimism and enthusiasm through-out her life. In the mid-late 1930’s, German-Jewish refu-gees began arriving in Boston, homeless, penniless and without food. Lenore and her sister ventured house-to-house raising money for these people. Because of her ef-forts, the combined Jewish philanthropies asked her to speak at their annual dinner. She was seated next to the guest of honor, who held her hand and quelled her nerves. Lenore remembers this woman as the most beautiful blue-eyed woman ever—Eleanor Roosevelt helped Lenore get through her first public speaking engagement. That was just the beginning of Lenore’s outward fo-cused life. She has always generously given to several (and now hundreds) of charities of all sorts. Her pile of mail each day rivals cor-porations. The Gardner house on Bicknell Street, had a game room on the 3rd floor, where friends often gathered. Some of Lenore’s best friends lived on her street and nearby. Many happy times were spent there. One night, Lenore was invited on a date with a guy she knew would be too busy to pay her any attention. She was envious of her sister who would be having a party at their house. She couldn’t wait to get home from the formal affair and loll about with her homies. They had transferred to Jack Gottler’s house across the street. When Lenore opened the door, across the room she saw Harold, the handsomest man. ‘‘That man is my future husband’’, was her thought. 5 years later on August 31, 1941 in an inti-mate family ceremony Lenore and Harold married. World War II and children followed. For the war effort, Lenore rolled up her sleeves and participated in the Woman’s De-fense Corps. There was loss, great tragedy and great love. Lenore and Harold wrote each other a letter every day of Harold’s 18-month deploy-ment and true to Lenore’s squirreling, every one of those letters have been saved and as-sembled into albums. Patty was born on base in Florida. What a blessing for those tumul-tuous, unknowing, scary years to come to an end in victory. Lenore was present for her nephew Lewis’ birth in Boca Raton on VJ day. Now the young family could live their lives in a burgeoning victorious post-war USA. Harold began his practice in Boston and soon Bruce was born. The Karlins needed to feath-er a bigger nest. They did that at 20 Old Farm Road, Newton, and it remained the family homestead for 40odd years. Jill and Robin were born there. Many of you here today might recall the good times, the fam-ily times, the parties, the welcoming times that the Karlins entertained or were simply available. It seemed there wasn’t a time/a night when after Lenore and Rosie poured their customary cocktail at 5:00 pm (and in the early years cigarettes) that someone wasn’t showing up to join in the festivities. Lenore kept Martinis and Manhattans de-canted in the fridge. Usually Uncle Leo and many others came by . . . Perhaps even one of you. Harold would arrive after a day of work and visiting patients in the hospital and at bedside (usually after 7:30) and the family al-ways ate some of Lenore’s famous freezer concoctions together. There would be phone call after phone call and visit after visit: People coming for shots, prescriptions, ear cleaning (ear piercing once) marriage coun-seling, or just to hang out in the warmth of the Karlin kitchen. People adored Harold and Lenore. They shared a great interest and love for people, which is why, over the years, they garnered so many friends including you. There were family vacations spent with some of you— the Jacksons, the Korsakovs, the Roberts, and the Sundells. Cape Cod, North Conway, or when Lenore and Harold would on an afternoon’s notice head to Brazil. That took Hutspah and organization to pull off. Lenore had, both, and some really good friends to look after the kids. The friendships—so many people to this day call, remember and consider Lenore as a caring friend. The age range is vast—chil-dren to elderly. There was a time when there was a triumvirate: the hilarity of Shirley, Eunice, and Lenore rivaled Lucy and Ethel. The three girls managed to get in trouble like a sitcom. Taking a pee in the woods, playing golf and coming home with poison ivy in a very uncomfortable spot or trying snow skiing and laughing so hard that they were wet from more than snow. The marriages, exchange students, friends, grandchildren—Lenore was sure to attend every meet, every match, every game even if it meant driving hours in harrowing condi-tions. Nothing daunted Lenore’s support for her grandchildren—it was unwavering. Birth-days, anniversaries, births, graduations, spe-cial occasions, surely there are many of you who could make a book of the cards Lenore has sent. She to this day never misses an op-portunity to make someone’s day brighter. Lenore has had a lifetime of volunteer work. PTA, Hospital Charity, Garden Club, and known as ‘‘The Plant Lady’’ as she and a gardening club buddy went via ‘‘The Plant Mobile’’ from school to school in the Boston inner city, teaching students to plant and grow plants. In addition she went weekly to The Hebrew Rehabilitation Center to help the elderly with planting and gardening. Le-nore also wrote Braille. She translated books into German in Braille. First she did this by hand, and in later years had a Braille type-writer. Lenore schlepped her children to every after-school class, whether they were inter-ested or not. She was interested and they were going—opera, ballet, tennis matches, ice skating. That is a theme in Lenore’s life—interest—great interest in everything. It can be a gray day and all Lenore will see is the little purple crocus making its way open. She is always eternally grateful and optimistic. When Harold died—true to Lenore’s style, it was soon overcome (not that one ever overcomes such loss). She soldiers on strong-er and doing things her way. She moved into Newbridge and seven years later closed her California residence. She has never looked back. Lenore does what she has always done— lives life on her terms. She exercises daily, she drinks (daily), and she drives (hopefully not at the same time). Firmly independent! So in honor of Lenore . . . Let’s all have a shot of American vodka! Here’s to you, Mom! Cheer’s to you, Mom! f
