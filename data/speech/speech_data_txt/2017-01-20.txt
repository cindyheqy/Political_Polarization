PRAYER The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-fered the following prayer: Let us pray. Eternal Father, our souls long for You, for we find strength and joy in Your presence. Increase our faith and teach us to trust You even during life’s storms. Today we have witnessed the peace-ful transition of power, and we are grateful for this great land. Guide our lawmakers. May they find strength and joy in Your presence. Lord, give them the wisdom to claim Your promise that You will never leave or forsake them and that nothing can separate them from Your love. Empower them to seek in every undertaking to know Your will, daily claiming the promise of Your wisdom. Keep them without stumbling or slipping, as You continue to do for them more than they can ask or imagine. We pray in Your mighty Name. Amen.

INAUGURATION AND CABINET NOMINEES Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, in November’s election, the people called for a new direction, a change from the last 8 years. Today, we took a mean-ingful step toward that new direction as we inaugurated a new President of the United States. I think it is important for all Ameri-cans—regardless of party—to remem-ber the significance of inauguration day. As we celebrate our Nation’s rich electoral tradition, we can begin to move our country forward together. It is always an honor to participate in the historical transition of power and the ceremonies surrounding it. Today was certainly no exception. On behalf of the Senate, I wish to express our gratitude to each individual, from law enforcement personnel to Inau-gural Committee staff, to congres-sional staff of volunteers whose efforts made this event a success. I wish to again congratulate Presi-dent Trump and Vice President PENCE  on today’s inauguration. We are eager to work with you and the administra-tion in advancing policies that can im-prove the lives of the American people. Today marks a new beginning. We are faced with many new opportunities. We are faced with some new challenges too. I will have more to say on that in the coming days. For now, the Senate remains hard at work as we move for-ward with the confirmation process on President Trump’s nominees. We will have an opportunity to confirm some today. It is imperative to proceed with con-firmations without delay, especially when it comes to key national and eco-nomic security needs. I urge colleagues to remember that we worked with the administration of former President Obama after he was first inaugurated. We confirmed seven—seven—members of his Cabinet on the day he took office and nearly the entire Cabinet was filled within 2 weeks. I wish to say, parenthetically, there is a lot the minority can do at the very beginning by refusing to give consent to drag this out, and that is what ap-parently is occurring here. The nomi-nations we are not doing are not even controversial. I would hope the feeling around here would be at least on day one to have some level of cooperation. We should work in the same spirit with the cur-rent administration and put the rest of President Trump’s team in place as soon as possible. Specifically, it is im-portant that we confirm General Mattis and General Kelly to their cru-cial positions as the Secretaries of De-fense and Homeland Security. That is not enough. We live in dan-gerous times. As the Democratic leader noted earlier just today, ‘‘We face threats foreign and domestic.’’ It is critical for the President to have a full national security team today, day one. That includes, in particular, the Direc-tor of the CIA. It makes no sense to

leave the post open, not for another week, not for another day, not for an-other hour. America’s enemies will not pause in plotting, planning, and train-ing simply because the Democrats refuse to vote. The American people ex-pect more. Earlier today, the Director and Dep-uty Director of the CIA resigned. They left. They are gone. The Director’s job is open and unfilled. We need to con-firm a new Director today. We need to confirm the rest of the Cabinet as quickly as we can. Republicans treated a newly inaugu-rated President Obama’s nominees fair-ly, and our Democratic friends should do so now. Our country is counting on it. I am told we want to have some de-bate about this. We will have as much debate time, starting right now, as our Democratic colleagues would like, but at the end of the debate, today—not Monday—we should install a new CIA Director. 
f 
THANKING FORMER PRESIDENT OBAMA Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, I wish to offer a few words regarding our outgoing President. I had a chance, as some others did yesterday, to receive a call from him, which I appreciated. I want to say farewell to President Obama. I think it is worth, once again, reflecting on the significance of his election and the historic achievement it represented in terms of our country’s past. That is something both he and our country should be very proud of. It is no secret that the President and I and other Members of my party have not always seen eye to eye. Over the years, we have pursued totally dif-ferent legislative priorities. Everybody around here knows that. The American people know that too. It is a big coun-try. We have different views about what ought to be done. Let me say this. I think I speak for all Americans when I thank our former President for his tremendous service to our Nation. As can be said of all First Families, he and his family have made many personal sacrifices over the past 8 years. Through it all, they have done so with dignity and with grace. To our 44th President, I wish to say, for your leadership, we are grateful. We wish you, Michelle, Malia, and Sasha all the best as you embark on this new chapter of your lives. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-pore. The Democratic whip is recog-nized. 
f 
NOMINATIONS Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I lis-tened carefully to the statement by the Republican leader on the floor, and I am hoping we can reach some agree-ment later today as to the nominations to be considered this day and very quickly next week. I will, for the record, make it clear that the seven nominees who moved through on the first day of the Obama administration were people who had their ethics state-ments filed on time, had filed all the legally required papers on time for re-view. Unfortunately, that is not the case for all of the nominees by the new Trump administration. Some of them bring to this nomination some extraor-dinarily challenging financial data, and because of their companies, be-cause of their lifestyles, because of their wealth, it takes longer to go through these documents than it does for people of modest means. When we proposed, by the Obama administra-tion, Penny Pritzker, of Chicago, to serve as Secretary of Commerce, it took 6 months to clear the paperwork on her financial background. The more complex the financial data, the more difficult and challenging it is for the committees of the Senate to do their work and to do it properly. We want to make certain we don’t cut any corners. We don’t want to cre-ate any advantage for any single nomi-nee. They have to be held to the same standard as the nominees under the Obama administration. I am hoping we can move on it with dispatch on some of these nominees, and I don’t quarrel with the Republican leader’s premise that there are some noncontroversial nominees who would be easier to han-dle than others. Let me quickly add, for those who have forgotten the record of the Repub-licans in the Senate when it comes to delaying nominations, exhibit A will continue to be the vacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court. For the first time in the history of the United States of America, the Republican majority in the U.S. Senate refused a hearing and a vote on a nominee to fill a vacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court. That went on for the entire duration of the Obama Presidency. Some 11 months, that posi-tion on the highest Court in the land remained vacant because of the specific political strategy of the Republican leader on the other side. He said: We will keep this open in the hopes that a Republican President will be able to fill it. He had a grin and a smile and, I guess, a feeling of accom-plishment on election day when a Re-publican was elected President. That vacancy continued for political rea-sons, regardless of the fact that it cre-ated at least a hardship and some con-fusion on the highest Court of the land. It went on for 10, 11 months, and it con-tinues to this day. I might also remind him that the nomination of Loretta Lynch for the highest law enforcement position in America sat on that Senate calendar for months, with no objection stated by any Member on the other side. They re-fused to call her name and allow a vote for the Attorney General of the United States of America. Similarly, an As-sistant Secretary of the Department of Treasury, a key position to deal with terrorism financing, was held on that calendar, I believe, for a year or more with no controversy. They had the power to do it, and they did it. So this notion that we slowed things down really negates and ignores the reality of the record before us. Mr. President, I yield the floor. Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I sug-gest the absence of a quorum. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-pore. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-pore. Without objection, it is so or-dered. f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-pore. The Democratic leader is recog-nized.

PEACEFUL TRANSFER OF POWER AND HOMEOWNER INSURANCE PREMIUMS Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, today we celebrate one of our democracy’s core attributes: the peaceful transfer of power. It is remarkable. I am always amazed how voters, on a cold Novem-ber evening in my State, come home from work—they would like to serve dinner to their kids or sit in their fa-vorite chair and watch their favorite TV show, but in quiet dignity, they wait in line and wait their turn to cast their vote. Then everyone awaits the decision. And the next morning, we all abide by it. It is an amazing thing about this democracy. There are no riots and tanks in the streets. It is a great thing. And although I regret the outcome of the election obviously— deeply—I still am awed by how the wellspring of democracy continues to work for 225 years after the Founders put together the remarkable document, the Constitution. Now it falls to us—Senators from both parties—to promote and defend these principles, as we must every day: the rule of law, equal protection for all Americans under it, and freedom of speech, press, and religion. We must also endeavor to expand opportunity and increase prosperity while broad-ening the circle of Americans who share in it. The peaceful transfer of power occurred, and our work starts now. President Trump said in his inau-gural address this afternoon: 
For too long, a small group in our Nation’s capital has reaped the rewards of govern-ment while the people have borne the cost. Washington flourished—but the people did not share its wealth. 
He promised to combat that trend, but in one of his first acts as President, President Trump made it harder for Americans to afford a mortgage. For working-class Americans, struggling Americans, now it is harder for them

to get a mortgage. What did he do? He reversed a recent decision by the De-partment of Housing and Urban Devel-opment to reduce annual insurance premiums that many borrowers pay, saving new homeowners an average of $500 per year. What a terrible thing to do to homeowners. President Trump, with a flick of the pen, ended that new policy, making it harder for Americans of modest means to obtain their piece of the rock, the American dream: their own home. It took only an hour after his positive words on the inaugural platform for his words to ring hollow. And actions speak louder than words. One hour after talking about helping working people and ending the cabal in Washington that hurts people, he signs a regulation that makes it more expen-sive for new homeowners to buy mort-gages—1 hour later. I ask the American people—because we Democrats are going to do this. We are going to hold the President ac-countable. Look at what the President said and then an hour later, look at what the President did. Again, actions speak louder than words. The words on that inaugural platform in relation to this new action ring hollow. Democrats agree with President Trump on this: The working men and women of America do not need more promises, they need policies that give them a leg up, help them succeed, help them afford a home, for instance. We urge President Trump to reverse this decision and give new homeowners across America their $500 back.

CABINET NOMINEES Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, on an-other matter—nominations—Senators on both sides of the aisle have ex-pressed support for the President’s key national security nominees. This evening, we expect to be able to vote on General Kelly and General Mattis, and we look forward to beginning the debate on Congressman P
OMPEO in the hopes that he can also receive a quick vote, but from there, we intend to have a full and rigorous debate on the Presi-dent-elect’s remaining nominees. My friends on the other side of the aisle did not want to have a full debate on the merits of these nominees in committee, so they should be prepared to do so on the Senate floor. Over the last several weeks, Republicans have made a mockery of the Cabinet hearing process, trying to jam through nomi-nees in truncated hearings—nominees with serious conflicts of interest and ethical issues unresolved—without giv-ing Senators and the American people a fair chance to question and hear from these nominees. If ever there were a group of Cabinet nominees who cry out for rigorous scrutiny, it is this one. I have never heard such a parade of potential eth-ical violations. The President-elect’s Cabinet is a swamp Cabinet, full of bil-lionaires and bankers, loaded with con-flicts of interest and ethical lapses as far as the eye can see. Congressman MULVANEY failed to pay taxes on a household worker—the exact same issue that has caused past nomi-nees to withdraw. Congressman P
RICE is facing serious scrutiny for trading stock with one hand and pushing legislation to boost that stock with the other. Rex Tillerson has refused to recuse himself from matters relating to ExxonMobil for the length of his term. Just yesterday we learned that Steve Mnuchin tried to hide his holdings in the Cayman Islands from the Senate Finance Committee. And, of course, at the top of the list is Betsy DeVos. Her ethics paperwork just came in after the hearing was completed. Did she not want to answer any questions on it? It shows that she was invested in multiple education companies, including companies that have millions of dollars of contracts with the Department of Education to collect on student debt. Senators have not been given an opportunity to ques-tion her about these investments be-cause we only got the information after the hearing. Sadly, the list goes on and on. The President-elect isn’t draining the swamp with his Cabinet picks, he is filling it up. It is no wonder that the American people have expressed dis-content with how this transition period is going. These issues that I mentioned, and many others, deserve to be thoroughly and rigorously reviewed by the Senate. If Senate Republicans will not let that happen in hearings, it will happen right here on the floor. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-pore. The majority leader.

UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREE-MENT—EXECUTIVE NOMINA-TIONS Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Sen-ate proceed to executive session for the en bloc consideration of the following nominations received today: James N. Mattis to be Secretary of Defense; and John F. Kelly to be Secretary of Home-land Security. I ask consent that there be 20 minutes of debate on the nomina-tions, equally divided in the usual form, and that following the use or yielding back of time, the Senate vote on the nominations in the order listed with no intervening action or debate; that if confirmed, the motions to re-consider be considered made and laid upon the table en bloc; that the Presi-dent be immediately notified of the Senate’s action; that no further mo-tions be in order; and that any state-ments relating to the nominations be printed in the R

Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-pore. Without objection, it is so or-dered. Mr. M

I yield the floor. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-pore. The Senator from Arizona. Mr. M
CCAIN. Mr. President, there is not a lot of benefit in being around here for a long period of time, but I re-member very well in January of 2009, when the new President of the United States and, in a spirit of enthusiasm and bipartisanship, the Senate, on the first day of the inauguration, approved of seven Cabinet members, seven—not two, as we are presently contem-plating, but seven. All of those individ-uals, as I recall, had some degree of concern about them, had some degree of controversy—some more, some less. But the fact is, we moved forward and almost unanimously voted in favor of these Cabinet members for the simple reason that the American people had spoken, and we had a new President of a different party, and we ought to give that President the team that he needed in order to get his job done. Now, the one difference between what I have seen here in 2017, since 2009, is that the world is on fire. Look at the world today, and look at a map of it in 2009. There weren’t 6 million refugees out of Syria. There weren’t 400,000 peo-ple murdered by Bashar al-Assad with the assistance of Vladimir Putin and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard. We didn’t have Russians using precision- guided weapons, striking hospitals in Aleppo, slaughtering innocent men, women, and children. We didn’t have the Chinese acting in the most bellig-erent fashion in the South China Sea, asserting their sovereignty over an

international waterway through which about 60 percent of the world’s econ-omy moves, as they are now. We didn’t have Vladimir Putin invad-ing Crimea in a violation of the Buda-pest agreement, in which Ukraine gave up their nuclear weapons arsenal in ex-change for a guarantee of the terri-torial integrity of Ukraine that in-cluded Crimea. We didn’t have Vladi-mir Putin invading the land of Ukraine and partitioning it and slaughtering some 10,000 brave Ukrainians who stood up against that invasion while, by the way, we wouldn’t even give them lethal weapons to defend themselves. We have a world on fire. And we have a nominee to be the Director of the CIA. I happen to know Congressman P
OMPEO very well. I happen to admire his work. I happened to notice in the hearing that there was really rel-atively no controversy associated with his candidacy, with his nomination to be the Director of the CIA. So my question to my dear friends on the other side of the aisle is: Why the hell won’t we just go ahead and give the President his national security team when we need it more than at any time in recent history? The American people have spoken about who they want to be Commander in Chief. Now let’s give the Commander in Chief his Secretary of Defense, his Secretary of Homeland Security, and let’s give him a leader of our intel-ligence community, the CIA. And, by God, when you look at the controversy surrounding our intelligence agencies— which is gigantic—we need a new Di-rector of the CIA more than ever. The American people made a deci-sion, but they also voiced—at least in my campaign, and I can only speak, frankly, for my own—a great dis-satisfaction about the fact that we don’t work together, the fact that we don’t sit down and talk about these things and get some kind of working arrangement. Well, how do you do that when we won’t even allow a non-controversial nominee for the Director of the CIA to be confirmed? I don’t get it. What is the point here? Is the point that we are just going to show the Re-publicans by slow-walking their nomi-nees? Is that what the point of this is? If it is, then in my view, you are con-tradicting the will of the American people and the verdict of the American people. I know there is controversy about the fact that Secretary Clinton got a larger number of the popular vote. I know the controversy that there were narrow victories in some of the States. But the fact is that no one in their right mind has challenged the fact that the President of the United States, whose inauguration took place today, is the President of the United States. So why would we want to—right out of the box, right out of the box, right immediately, at an incredibly con-troversial time—block a member of his Cabinet who needs to take charge with the confidence of the U.S. Senate that he will do a job and, frankly, restore— whether you happen to like the out-going team or not. And if you want to praise them, fine; if you want to sup-port them, fine. But the fact is, there is a huge controversy about our intel-ligence community. In fact, some of that, in my view, has been contributed to by the now-President of the United States with his comments about the in-telligence community. But on both sides of the aisle, we re-spect and admire Congressman POMPEO , who is well qualified. Is there anyone who has said he is not quali-fied? Is there anyone on the other side who said that P
OMPEO is not qualified; we haven’t examined his record enough? I don’t think so. If so, I haven’t heard it. But is the message now: We are just going to slow-walk the Republicans be-cause we don’t like the outcome of the election? I don’t think that is the mes-sage that I would like to send from our side. Have we, on our side, slow-walked from time to time? Have we done ev-erything right? I am not defending ev-erything that we have done on this side. But I do argue that, in January of 2009, we confirmed seven members of the President’s team on the first day. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question? Mr. M
CCAIN. I am glad to yield for a question. Mr. CORNYN. I ask the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Com-mittee whether a period of transition from one administration to another is a time of particular vulnerability to the United States, at a time when we are transitioning not only to a new ad-ministration but also to a new national security Cabinet. Isn’t this a time of particular vulner-ability for the United States? Mr. M
CCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be yielded an additional 2 minutes. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-pore. Without objection, it is so or-dered. Mr. M
CCAIN. Mr. President, I would just like to say to my friend from Texas, our leader, that there is enor-mous controversy about our intel-ligence community overall. Questions have been raised going all the way back to weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, questions about what we know or don’t know about Russian involvement in the last election. It seems to me that all of the things that the Senator from Texas just said argue for a rapid transition to a person we all trust. I would ask the Senator from Texas very quickly: Has he heard someone who objects to Congressman P
OMPEO  assuming the role of Director of the CIA? Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I am re-sponding to the Senator from Arizona. I am not confident that he will get a unanimous vote here, but he will cer-tainly be confirmed resoundingly under the rules established by the Demo-cratic majority in the last Congress, which allow 51 votes for confirmation. Mr. MCCAIN. Respectfully and with high regard, I would just ask my col-leagues on the other side of the aisle— let’s get this intelligence team to work. Let’s put them together. We will have outstanding individuals in a time when, in the view of most observers, this Nation is in greater peril than it has been in 70 years. This is a very, very serious situation we find ourselves in. The people have spoken. Let’s confirm them today. I yield the floor. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-pore. The Senator from Rhode Island. Mr. REED. Mr. President, I have the privilege of being the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, working with Senator M
CCAINwith re-spect to the nomination of General Mattis. I am strongly in favor of the gen-eral’s confirmation for many reasons. He possesses three distinct qualities that are absolutely critical: con-fidence, courage, and character. And he will eminently demonstrate those vir-tues as Secretary of Defense, in my view. I would like to also inform the body and everyone else that we just did this in a very thorough, careful, thoughtful way. General Mattis was subject to a 60- vote procedural vote because we had to waive his time from retirement to his ability to serve as Secretary of De-fense. We had a hearing under the auspices of the chairman about the policy with two noted historians and policy ex-perts. Then we had a hearing with Gen-eral Mattis. We have collectively—and the chairman’s leadership is invalu-able—moved to ensure that today we can confirm General Mattis. This has been an opportunity that we have not used to delay, defer, or deflect the Mattis nomination. In fact, it was the one that we all recognized that would have been subject to a 60-vote point of order. So this represents the demonstrated good faith of our focus to ensure that we can get people in place for the President. With that, I yield to the Senator from Oregon, Mr. W
YDEN . The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-pore. The Senator from Oregon. Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I will be very brief, just to respond to my good friend from Arizona who said that the Senate not taking up Pompeo would be contradicting the will of the people. That is not the case at all. This is about whether the Senate is going to be a rubberstamp and whether the Sen-ate is in effect going to abdicate its re-sponsibility to do oversight. Let me just mention four points real quickly. No. 1, this nomination has not been considered in the Intelligence Com-mittee. It could have been. It was not.

No. 2, we have not been able to get an-swers to our questions. A major ques-tion in particular, this body voted to sideline a law that collected phone records on law-abiding Americans. Con-gressman P
OMPEO has proposed some-thing that makes the law we sidelined look like small potatoes. He is talking about collecting lifestyle information on all Americans. We are trying to get an answer about whether there are any legal boundaries at all. We have not been able to get them. That is argu-ment No. 2. Argument No. 3 is that we have never confirmed on inauguration day a CIA Director. That is the history of this particular nomination. No. 4, I want to talk about the realities of national se-curity because I share the view of the chairman of the committee that this is a dangerous time. That is not up for debate. There are lots of people out there who do not wish our country well. If we were to have a tragedy to-night or tomorrow—heaven forbid that happens to our great country—if it did, we would have the talented senior peo-ple at the CIA there to protect our country, and I would submit, however you feel about Mr. P
OMPEO , the reality is that if he got confirmed tonight or tomorrow, and heaven forbid there was that tragedy, we would still be relying on those trained, talented professionals at the CIA who have been there, in some cases for decades, to protect our country when we are vulnerable. That is what this is all about, ensur-ing that we actually have some discus-sion here when there are outstanding questions. Senator L
EAHY , Senator B
LUMENTHAL , and I have all said we just believe there ought to be some de-bate. There hasn’t been any in the In-telligence Committee. There hasn’t been any on the floor. I have gone through the history of this nomination and explained what would happen if a tragedy were to befall our great coun-try. That is why I think we ought to have a debate in broad daylight, not when Senators are trying to figure out if their tux is going to fit and we can’t get people into a real discussion. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-pore. The Senator from Arizona. Mr. M
CCAIN. Mr. President, let me just say to my colleagues that I have had the great honor in my life of know-ing some outstanding military leaders. I consider it one of the highlights of my life being around one of these great leaders. I want to share with my colleagues that I haven’t seen a finer leader, a more outstanding and respected leader, and a more beloved leader than the man we are going to be voting on to be the Secretary of Defense, James Mattis. My friends, I am very confident that when we finish this vote, the morale all over the U.S. military will go up be-cause they will know they have a lead-er and a leader they can not only re-spect but they admire and in many cases have great affection for. So I urge my colleagues to vote aye on the Mattis nomination. Mr. President, today on the steps of this Capitol, our Nation completed an-other peaceful transition of power and inaugurated a new President. This is a sacred rite of our democracy, one that so many have given their lives to make possible. And as free citizens, we should count ourselves fortunate to have witnessed it. As our new Commander In Chief as-sumes the awesome responsibilities of his office and with threats to our na-tional security growing in scope and severity, it is imperative that the Sen-ate act quickly to provide advice and consent for the new cabinet, especially for the new Secretary of Defense. Have no doubt: our adversaries will test us in the coming days and weeks. And when they do, I want our Com-mander In Chief to have Gen. James Mattis at his side. I have had the privilege of knowing General Mattis for many years. He is, without a doubt, one of the finest mili-tary officers of his generation and an extraordinary leader who inspires a rare and special admiration of his troops. In fact, since his selection to be our next Secretary of Defense, I have received countless messages of support from those who had the honor of serv-ing with him. At his confirmation hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee, General Mattis demonstrated excep-tional command of the issues con-fronting the United States, the Depart-ment of Defense, and our military servicemembers. He also showed that his understanding of civil-military re-lations is deep and that his commit-ment to civilian control of the Armed Forces is ironclad. Over more than four decades of serv-ice, General Mattis’s character, judg-ment, and commitment to defending our Nation and our Constitution have earned him the trust of Presidents, Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle, and so many serving in our Armed Forces. That is why the Senate Armed Serv-ices Committee approved General Mattis’s nomination this Wednesday with an overwhelming bipartisan vote of 26 to 1. I hope the Senate will follow suit with a strong vote to put General Mattis to work at the Pentagon. Amer-ica will be fortunate to have General Mattis at her service once again. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I will vote for James Mattis to be the next Secretary of Defense. General Mattis stands out as a top practitioner in his field. He has earned—and rightly deserves—near-universal respect. While I opposed the hurried waiving of a care-fully considered statutory cooling off period for members of the military be-fore they can become eligible for this civilian position, I made clear then, and restate now, that my opposition to this waiver was never about General Mattis himself. I was grateful when General Mattis said in his confirmation hearing that, even from his first days as a marine, he has observed that, in the photographs on the walls of Department of Defense establishments, the civilians in suits were above those of the men and women in uniforms. I was pleased that he vowed to uphold that meaningful tradition. I am confident that, as the President’s top adviser on matters of defense, as Secretary, General Mattis will carefully provide considered de-fense advice, maximizing the wisdom of not only the Active, Reserve, and Na-tional Guard, but the whole of the De-partment of Defense, including Depart-ment civilians. Donald Trump will sorely need that experience and advice. Last weekend, President Trump again denigrated our NATO allies, a partnership that Presi-dent Kennedy very much had in mind when he vowed at his own inauguration to ‘‘pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, and oppose any foe to assure the sur-vival and success of liberty.’’ General Mattis clearly understands the value of our NATO alliance. His condemnation of Russia’s efforts to ‘‘break’’ NATO stands in stark contrast to the position of the man who has nominated him and, to me, demonstrates the sound, experienced reasoning that will provide a necessary balance to President Trump. I do harbor reservations about Gen-eral Mattis’s past statements as a pri-vate citizen related to equality within the ranks of our servicemembers. I would have much preferred to hear General Mattis renounced those past statements, but I do appreciate that, in his confirmation hearings, he said that there is nothing innate about gender or orientation that makes someone a bet-ter soldier than another. I believe the results of the progress made under President Obama will show clearly that the Nation succeeds when it has the best individuals serving to their fullest potential in the position that best matches his or her abilities. The Secretary of Defense is, of course, a critically important position. There are countless difficult choices General Mattis will have to make in steering the Department in a direction that more effectively utilizes its budg-et to respond to today’s rapidly evolv-ing challenges. And whether it is the persistent, shockingly high rates of sexual assault within the Armed Forces and of suicide among young vet-erans, or the need for far more rigorous oversight of Defense resources to re-duce waste, fraud, and abuse, the next Secretary will need to demonstrate that the Department is capable of ef-fectively addressing its own internal problems, in addition to defending the Nation. In these unsettling times, General Mattis will provide a voice of experi-ence and reason to what, by all ac-counts, looks to be an undisciplined, impulsive, and inexperienced Com-mander in Chief. On the Appropriations Committee and in other ways, I look

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES352 January 20, 2017 
forward to working closely with Gen-eral Mattis in this new role. Mr. President, the Senate today con-siders the nomination of John Kelly to be the Secretary of Homeland Security. A retired marine, General Kelly is no stranger to security efforts. Over more than four decades of service in the Ma-rines, General Kelly distinguished him-self through multiple commands and tours of duty. He is well respected by elected officials, military officers, the Marines under his command, and the law enforcement and intelligence com-munities. I have no reason to doubt that he is a man of integrity. But General Kelly is nominated to a far different post than those he occu-pied during his distinguished military career. The Department of Homeland Security—a civilian agency within our government—is charged with a far- reaching mission. From protecting na-tional security to implementing immi-gration policies, from our emergency response to domestic crises, to assist-ing in the unending fight against drugs in our communities that today features opioids and heroin as its most preva-lent threat, the Department of Home-land Security faces challenges as unique as they are numerous. While I am confident that General Kelly is well equipped to exert leadership on many of these challenges, his nomination has also raised concerns. As we look ahead to the policies and practices this new administration will seek to implement, we cannot forget the work left unfinished in the Obama administration due to the obstruction of congressional Republicans. In 2013, after a strong bipartisan vote in the Senate, truly comprehensive immigra-tion reform legislation was sent to the House of Representatives, where Re-publican leaders there refused to even bring it to a vote. That legislation ad-dressed a litany of issues facing our broken immigration system, from se-curing our borders to reforming visa programs, from bringing the undocu-mented out of the shadows to reuniting families. After House Republicans failed to bring that bill to a vote, President Obama took executive action to expand the Deferred Action for Childhood Ar-rivals, DACA, and establish the De-ferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents, DAPA, programs. These actions would have offered a reprieve for young peo-ple and parents so that they could re-main in the country, with their fami-lies, and without fear of deportation. It is fundamentally unfair for the new ad-ministration to revoke a policy de-signed to bring vulnerable immigrants out of the shadows and then to use in-formation gained from that policy to punish them. I was disheartened when a Federal court issued an injunction preventing implementation of these policies. I was more disheartened when the Supreme Court was unable to resolve this court challenge, again, due to obstruction from congressional Republicans in the consideration of President Obama’s nominee to the Supreme Court. Now, this new administration is poised to withdraw these executive orders. General Kelly is no stranger to the problems we face along the southern border. As the commander of U.S. Southern Command, he is familiar not only with immigration challenges, but with drug trafficking. While I am grateful that he has not subscribed to the singular approach that President Trump has thus far proposed with re-spect to constructing a wall along our southern border, I am deeply concerned that he has admonished so-called sanc-tuary cities and has testified that ac-celerating the deportation of undocu-mented immigrants will provide the so-lution to our broken immigration sys-tem. These views are not supported by the facts, and they are contrary to the work undertaken by the Senate just 4 years ago to comprehensively address these problems. I am also concerned about his tenure as the military officer in charge of the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, given reports that he opposed its closure and limited press access to the facility. Vermonters know that the explosion of heroin and opioid abuse across the country can, in many ways, be attrib-uted to the cross-border trafficking of illegal drugs. General Kelly has been a strong defender of a U.S. counter-narcotics strategy which, in my view and the view of many others, has been a costly failure. Since President Rea-gan’s first Andean Counter Drug Pro-gram, the interrelated problems of drugs, corruption, and violence that have plagued countries in South and Central America, and spilled over into our own country, have gotten progres-sively worse. I do not doubt that General Kelly will be confirmed to this post. Knowing that, I do want to work with him to build on successful policies such as preclearance operations, TSA Precheck, and the visa waiver program. I look forward to partnering with him to ensure the continuation of efforts to keep our northern border secure, while remaining open to the trade and com-merce we conduct with Canada, our largest trading partner. I look forward to working with General Kelly to en-sure that the Federal Emergency Man-agement Agency is fully supported and able to respond to domestic disasters. And I look forward to working with General Kelly to address vulnerabilities in our cyber infrastruc-ture. There are many challenges ahead. The Department of Homeland Security was hastily created in the wake of the September 11 attacks and, in my view, has become an unwieldly bureaucracy that suffers from inadequate trans-parency and accountability. This has resulted in adverse, sometimes severe consequences for many vulnerable peo-ple and their families who deserved better from this country. The Depart-ment needs significant reform in order to effectively confront these chal-lenges, and I urge General Kelly to seek the input of a wide range of ex-perts, as well as Congress, in identi-fying and implementing long overdue reforms. And above all, I hope General Kelly, as the Secretary of Homeland Security, will provide a thoughtful and reasoned balance to the extreme pro-posals thus far put forward by Presi-dent Trump. Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the nomination of Gen. John F. Kelly to be Secretary of Home-land Security. This is a tremendously important position, especially in these dangerous and uncertain times, and it requires a highly qualified nominee who will be able to handle one of the most complex positions here in Wash-ington, DC. After his impressive career and nomination hearing, few would question that he has the knowledge and the skill to lead the agency. He has years of experience working with our neighbors in Latin America as former commander of U.S. Southern Command, where he saw firsthand the drivers of the unaccompanied minors crisis. In his testimony, he outlined what he saw as the root causes of mi-gration, including people fleeing vio-lence and seeking asylum within the United States. Yet the position requires more than experience, it requires a true under-standing of the issues and how they af-fect the men and women we are all sworn to serve. It is in this aspect that I have lingering concerns. Anyone running DHS must be able to prioritize their resources in the appre-hension, detention, and removal of un-documented immigrants. On November 20, 2014, the Department of Homeland Security outlined how scarce Federal resources would be allocated in enforc-ing our Nation’s immigration laws. The memo focused resources on threats to national security, threats to national safety, and threats to border security, while deemphasizing law-abiding immi-grants who have integrated themselves into society. I have been generally sup-portive of this prioritization, as I be-lieve that Federal resources should be spent on enforcement actions against serious criminals. On day one as Secretary of Homeland Security, General Kelly will have to address this. I hope he will recognize the wisdom of keeping families to-gether, protecting children and the De-ferred Action for Childhood Arrivals DACA Program and focus on deporting serious criminals and those who truly pose a threat to our national security. This focus isn’t about being liberal or conservative but is a smart and hu-mane approach to enforcement of our immigration laws. General Kelly will have to grapple with the realities of our immigration system. As Secretary of Homeland Se-curity, General Kelly will be tasked with the critical duty of maintaining our southwest borders. We have heard

promises by the President-elect to build a wall that would cost taxpayers $25 billion; yet a wall will not secure the border or stop the flow of illegal drugs into the country. General Kelly himself noted that a wall alone is not enough. I hope that General Kelly will recognize that $25 billion is better spent trying to reduce factors that drive people to the United States. After speaking to General Kelly and listening to his testimony, I am cau-tiously optimistic that this is a nomi-nee who understands the issues that will be in front of a Homeland Security Secretary. Ultimately, to truly under-stand the issues, General Kelly will need an ongoing dialog with those such as myself who care deeply about fixing our immigration system. As my col-leagues are aware, my record of stand-ing up for immigrants is clear from years of work on comprehensive immi-gration reform. General Kelly should hear the stories about those with loved ones who have been torn from their homes and sent back to a country they no longer have a connection with. He should talk to those young immigrants who are American in every way except for a piece of paper who have come out of the shadows, registered with the government, and applied for DACA and fear being deported under this new ad-ministration. He should hear from par-ents who have U.S. citizen children and have lived in this country for over a decade and live with the constant threat of being separated from their children. I will support the nomination of Gen-eral Kelly to be the Secretary of Home-land Security. However, I plan on using every procedural and legislative tool to push back against any deportation force or policies that indiscriminately separate families, targets DREAMers, and generate fear in our immigrant communities. Mr, JOHNSON. Mr. President, I am honored to speak today in support of Gen. John Kelly’s nomination to be America’s fifth Secretary of the De-partment of Homeland Security. We would be hard pressed to find an individual who is better suited to this challenge, in these perilous times. General Kelly served this Nation for 45 years as a proud marine. He com-manded the finest among us during three tours in Iraq. He rose to the rank of four-star general. And tragically, he became the most senior military offi-cer to lose a child in combat when his son, Marine 2nd. Lt. Robert Kelly, was killed in November of 2010 in Afghani-stan. As a four star general and a Gold Star parent, General Kelly has served and sacrificed—he knows the price of freedom. Perhaps the best way to describe the man we should confirm today is to use his own words given in testimony be-fore our committee: ‘‘I am humbled to once again be called to serve, this time with the men and women of the Department of Homeland Security. As I solemnly swore before God when I entered the Marine Corps, if con-firmed, I will faithfully support and de-fend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies foreign and domestic—every second of every day. I believe in America and the prin-ciples upon which our country and way of life are guaranteed. I believe in re-spect, tolerance, and diversity of opin-ion. I have a profound respect for the rule of law and will always strive to uphold it. I have never had a problem speaking truth to power, and I firmly believe that those in power deserve full candor and my honest assessment and recommendations. I love my country, and I will do ev-erything within my power to preserve our liberty, enforce our laws, and pro-tect our citizens. I recognize the many challenges facing the Department of Homeland Security—and should I be confirmed—I look forward to partnering with you all to protect the homeland.’’ Colleagues, we are fortunate to have a man of such high caliber who is will-ing to once again answer the call of duty. I urge all of you to support his confirmation today. Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I support the nomination of General James Mattis to serve as Secretary of Defense. I voted against enacting an exception to the National Security Act for a re-cently retired general to serve as Sec-retary of Defense, but that vote was in support of our Nation’s tradition of ci-vilian leadership of the military. Now that General Mattis’s nomination is before the Senate on the merits, I be-lieve that he will provide the experi-ence and steady hand that will serve this administration well. General Mattis has served as a com-mander of NATO coalition troops. He commanded troops in Iraq and Afghani-stan. And he was commander of the U.S. Central Command, responsible for American military operations in the Middle East, Northeast Africa, and Central Asia. General Mattis has served as a visiting fellow at the Hoo-ver Institution at Stanford University, and Members of both parties who have worked with him have testified to his breadth of knowledge and under-standing of key threats and America’s role in the world. I was heartened to hear in the course of General Mattis’s hearing and the Senate’s consideration of his nomina-tion that he has many views that are more reasoned than those expressed by President-Elect Trump. His testimony made clear that he recognizes the very real challenges posed by Russia, and the importance of reassuring our NATO allies of America’s commitment to our common defense and mutual obliga-tions. I am pleased to hear that Gen-eral Mattis opposes the use of torture and has no intention to reverse Depart-ment of Defense policies on women and the LGBT community. I hope that Gen-eral Mattis’s counsel will persuade President Trump on these matters. I believe that General Mattis’s knowledge of and familiarity with international affairs will be of help to the incoming President and the Nation and thus I support his nomination. Mr. President, President Trump ran a divisive campaign that engaged in fear- mongering against many immigrants and scapegoated Muslim Americans. To the extent that he attempts to act on that irresponsible rhetoric, I will strongly oppose him. Thus, I appreciated many of General Kelly’s comments in his confirmation hearing before the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, including his opposition to a registry based on ethnicity or religion and his skepticism of the utility of an expensive massive border wall. I hope that General Kelly will use his voice to advocate for those views in the new ad-ministration. General Kelly has an admirable record of public service, including lead-ership of the U.S. Southern Command, which is responsible for Central Amer-ica, South America, and the Caribbean. He has a strong relationship with cur-rent Homeland Security Secretary, Jeh Johnson, which will help support a smooth transition of the $40 billion agency with its 240,000 employees. I am concerned, however, that at General Kelly’s confirmation hearing, Senator H
ARRIS repeatedly asked him whether he would honor the commit-ment made to DACA children and DREAMers not to share their personal information with Immigration and Customs Enforcement to protect them from deportation. General Kelly re-peatedly declined to say that he would. DACA recipients submitted their per-sonal information to the government on the assurance from the Department of Homeland Security that their infor-mation would not be used against them. These families now live in fear that the new administration will tear them apart. I hope that these concerns prove to be unwarranted, and, should General Kelly be confirmed, I look forward to working with him to both protect our homeland and the values we hold dear. However, his failure to provide assur-ances that he will meet the commit-ment we have made to these individ-uals who came to the United States as children means I cannot support his nomination today.

NOMINATION OF MIKE POMPEO  
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to associate myself with what the distin-guished Senator from Oregon has said. My concerns—and they will be in my full statement about Mr. P
OMPEO —are his suggestions in the past of sweeping authority for the government to col-lect bulk information on all Ameri-cans; that is, every American in this room, every American in this city, and every American in this country. We have strong bipartisan legislation that we have worked for years on, trying to

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES354 January 20, 2017 
get Republicans and Democrats across the political spectrum to set into law what the rules should be. His state-ments show that he wants to throw it all overboard. So I have concerns. Mr. President, our intelligence agen-cies have an enormous task ahead. The challenges they face range from state- sponsored information warfare to coun-tering violent extremists around the world. Among those who will lead these efforts will be the next Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. The im-portance of the CIA cannot be over-stated, and now, perhaps more than ever, we need a Director who will man-age the agency with the full confidence of the American people. This con-fidence is based not only on a future Director’s ability to comprehend secu-rity challenges, but on his or her abil-ity to safeguard the privacy and civil liberties of all Americans and to up-hold and advance United States leader-ship in protecting human rights. I have serious concerns with Presi-dent Trump’s nominee to lead the CIA. Congressman P
OMPEO has called for the reestablishment of the bulk collection of Americans’ phone records, and has even argued that the intelligence com-munity should combine that metadata ‘‘with publicly available financial and lifestyle information into a com-prehensive, searchable database.’’ He went on to say that ‘‘[l]egal and bu-reaucratic impediments to surveillance should be removed.’’ But Congress out-right rejected the bulk collection of Americans’ records when it passed the USA FREEDOM Act of 2015 on an over-whelming bipartisan basis—the very program that Congressman P
OMPEO  said that he wants to bring back. During his testimony last week, Con-gressman P
OMPEO attempted to diffuse this and other questions about his more alarming positions by affirming his appreciation of the supremacy of law. It sounded to me like the tried and true confirmation conversion. I appre-ciate that he testified that he under-stands the responsibility of a Director to uphold the Constitution and the laws passed by Congress. But I remain deeply concerned that he advocated for such dangerous measures in the first place. And I am concerned that he will push to remove ‘‘legal and bureaucratic impediments to surveillance’’—just as he said last year. We face grave threats from around the world, whether from Russia, from ISIS, or other adversaries. The director of the CIA must be trusted by all Americans to protect us from these threats, but also to protect our Na-tion’s core values. I don’t question Congressman P
OMPEO ’s loyalty to our Nation. I do question his stated beliefs that immediate security concerns can be used as a justification for eroding the fundamental rights of Americans. For these reasons, I cannot support Congressman P
OMPEO ’s nomination. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-pore. The Senator from North Carolina. Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I ask unan-imous consent for 2 additional minutes on each side. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-pore. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I would like to respond to the statement of the Senator from Oregon. As chairman of the Intelligence Committee, let me just tell Members that Congressman POMPEO has made himself available to every Member on the Committee for private meetings in their office. For everyone who would take a meeting, he met with them. He came before the committee in open session and in closed session. In open session, he stayed for as long as Members had questions, and all ques-tions were answered. Congressman P
OMPEO received from the committee over 150—may have been over 200— questions for the record. Today all questions are answered. I can’t address whether there was ever a CIA Director who was confirmed on inauguration day, but I can’t think of a time where the country has been more challenged with threats around the world and at home than we are right now. We carried out military acts last night and the night before. We have just gotten through with one of the highest security events in the his-tory of this country in Washington, DC. Why aren’t we taking up Representa-tive P
OMPEO today? It is not because there is disagreement, it is not because we haven’t had an opportunity to ask enough questions or talk to him face- to-face and get answers. It is because some people don’t want to vote on it today. They want to wait until Mon-day. I am willing to debate this as long as it needs to be debated. I don’t want to cut off anybody’s debate, but I think we owe it to the country to have a vote today. That can be in an hour, it can be in 5 hours, but I think we ought to pro-vide this President with a CIA Director who is in charge. Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question? Mr. BURR. I will be happy to yield. Mr. M
CCAIN. I object. It is time for the vote. Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, there were 2 minutes extended to each side, if I am not mistaken. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-pore. The Senator cannot object. There is 2 minutes on both sides. Mr. BURR. Mr. President, let me con-clude and then the Senator can claim his own time. We ought to do this. We ought to do it for the country, not for ourselves. It is not about us. This is about doing something for the country. An Acting Director of the CIA is just not suffi-cient, whether it is for a day or wheth-er it is for a week. Right now they need leadership that is permanent. They need to know tomorrow who is heading that Agency. I would urge my col-leagues, let’s confirm him today. We have had enough time to ask every question possible, and now is the time to vote on confirmation. I yield the floor. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-pore. The Senator from Illinois. Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I only want to ask my friend from North Carolina, the chairman of the com-mittee, two questions. Is it traditional for the Senate Intel-ligence Committee that you chair to report out a nominee like Congressman POMPEO , and have you reported him out of your committee to the floor? Mr. BURR. The Senator’s question is a very good one. It is normal for us to report out. We thought we had a deal with the Demo-cratic leader. That is why we didn’t discharge him. That is why we didn’t have a business meeting this week. I regret that I didn’t schedule that, but it certainly could have been, and I will not make that mistake again. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-pore. All time for the majority has ex-pired. Who yields time? The Senator from Michigan. Mr. DURBIN. The Democratic side yields back all time. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-pore. All time has expired.

CONFIRMATION OF JOHN KELLY Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I voted in favor of the nomination of Gen. John Kelly to be U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security, and I am submit-ting this statement to explain my vote. This nomination is not a referendum on President Donald Trump’s immigra-tion policy. If it were, I would have voted against the nomination. In considering this nomination, the questions are whether General Kelly is unqualified to serve as Homeland Secu-rity Secretary and whether his views are too extreme to lead our homeland security and immigration enforcement efforts. In my view, General Kelly eas-ily passes both tests. Gen. John Kelly is clearly qualified to head up the Homeland Security De-partment. He served honorably in the U.S. Marine Corps for more than four decades, first as an enlistee and later as an officer, culminating in his role as commander of U.S. Southern Com-mand. As SOUTHCOM commander, Kelly oversaw a variety of operations in the Caribbean, Central America, and South America from headquarters in Miami. General Kelly knows better than most what is at stake in our efforts to protect our Nation from harm. He served three tours in Iraq, and in 2010, his son, Marine 1st Lt. Robert Michael Kelly, 29, was killed in southern Af-ghanistan while leading his platoon on a combat patrol when he stepped on a concealed bomb. He is the highest ranking military officer to lose a child in combat in Afghanistan or Iraq. I am sure that I will disagree with General Kelly on some occasions, but he does not have a track record of ex-treme statements on immigration or the other issues that will be under his jurisdiction as Homeland Security Sec-retary. I know that some of my Democratic colleagues voted against General Kelly’s nomination because he refused to publicly commit to keeping the De-ferred Action for Childhood Arrivals— DACA—program in place and to pro-tecting DACA recipients from deporta-tions. Reasonable people can disagree, and I respect my colleagues who are voting against General Kelly’s nomina-tion, but I don’t believe this justifies opposing this nomination. There is no one in the Senate who is more committed than I to protecting the DACA program and no one who has worked harder to protect the young immigrants who are eligible for this program. Seven years ago, I was the first Member of Congress to ask Presi-dent Obama to establish the DACA pro-gram. DACA is based on the DREAM Act, legislation I first introduced 16 years ago that would give undocu-mented students who grew up in this country a chance to earn their citizen-ship. The young people who are eligible for DACA and the DREAM Act are known as DREAMers. Over the years, I have met hundreds of DREAMers and I have come to the floor more than 100 times to tell these DREAMers’ stories, which make the case for DACA and the DREAM Act better than I ever could. Last week, General Kelly came to my office to meet with me. We spent most of our time discussing DACA and the DREAMers. General Kelly promised me that, if he was confirmed, he would be a part of the discussions about the fu-ture of DACA. He said that he felt strongly that DREAMers should be protected from deportation and that he would fight for that view. General Kelly also committed that he would come to Chicago with me to meet with a group of DREAMers and to visit an immigration detention center, so that he would understand the human impact of the laws he will be enforcing. Based on these assurances, I am pleased to be able to support General Kelly’s nomination. But let me be clear. If General Kelly supports an ef-fort by the new administration to re-scind DACA or deport DREAMers, I will fight him tooth and nail. I congratulate General Kelly on his confirmation, and I look forward to working with him on the critical issues under his jurisdiction, especially the future of DACA and the DREAMers. Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, today I voted against the confirmation of Gen-eral John Kelly to be Secretary of Homeland Security. I have deep con-cerns about the homeland security policies that President Trump advo-cated during the campaign, and I worry that as Secretary of Homeland Secu-rity, General Kelly will feel it nec-essary to work to advance those reck-less policies. For instance, General Kelly was unable to promise the Senate that the administration will refrain from deporting our nation’s DREAM-ers, and I am troubled by his stated plans to reverse the Deferred Action for Child Arrivals, DACA, program. Furthermore, General Kelly did not provide sufficient assurance that he fully opposes the President’s wasteful and misguided plan for a border wall. However, now that he has been con-firmed, it is my hope that Secretary Kelly will be the voice of reason in the deliberations to shape the Trump ad-ministration’s homeland security pol-icy and that many of the reckless ideas candidate Trump espoused during the election will never become reality. While I voted against General Kelly, I recognize and appreciate his long and distinguished career in the marines. I believe this experience, particularly his final assignment as head of the U.S. Southern Command, will serve him well. In addition, I am encouraged by several statements General Kelly made during his confirmation hearing— statements that are at odds with the dangerous comments President Trump made during the campaign. At the hearing, General Kelly spoke out against the use of torture and said the U.S. should always abide by the Ge-neva Conventions. He did state that building a wall along the southern bor-der was not an effective way to secure the border, though he has not promised to oppose such a plan. He agreed with the intelligence community’s assess-ment that Russia was responsible for hacking into our elections. He said that surveilling mosques and targeting Muslims as security threats was unac-ceptable. Finally, he said the sweeping collection of data on Americans vio-lated the right to privacy and a much more focused effort is needed. General Kelly has a reputation for speaking truth to power—I sincerely hope he does so as a member of the Cabinet, and I hope the President will listen. New Mexico is a majority-mi-nority border State with thousands of hard-working families now living in fear of President Trump’s immigration plans. Unfortunately, I am deeply con-cerned that General Kelly will be the instrument of the President’s harmful and backwards homeland security agenda.

CONFIRMATION OF JAMES MATTIS Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, Gen. Jim Mattis is an extraordinary individual and an American patriot who has dedi-cated his life to service of country. Nevertheless, his nomination did con-cern me, given that it was contrary to underlying law that has been in place since World War II. This law restricts individuals who have come out of the military less than 7 years ago from serving as Secretary of Defense. The reason for this longstanding law is to ensure civilian control over the mili-tary. Civilian control is an important American tradition which General

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S357 January 20, 2017 
Mattis himself called a ‘‘fundamental tenet of the American military tradi-tion.’’ Due to this fundamental concern, I opposed the legislation to create an ex-ception to the law to allow General Mattis to serve. I intend to oppose any future such exceptions for any future President as long as I serve in the Sen-ate. However, now that the exception exists for General Mattis, and he is eli-gible to serve and has been nominated, I supported his confirmation today. During his confirmation hearing, he clearly stressed that he understood his new role and would work to ensure the longstanding American tradition of ci-vilian control. He will serve at the pleasure of the new President, but his job now is not to simply give and fol-low orders, but provide candid advice, ask tough questions, provide civilian leadership, and exert broad manage-ment over all aspects of DOD, not only warfighting. During his career in the U.S. Marines he has distinguished him-self both in combat and at home, earn-ing the respect of his fellow marines as well as servicemembers in every branch of the military. He has also held his marines and anyone serving with him to the highest of standards, emphasizing commitment to duty and the importance of learning and per-fecting their profession. While I voted against a waiver for him to serve as Secretary of Defense, I in no way can oppose him on the mer-its now that the waiver has been ap-proved. My vote on the waiver was no way a reflection of my support for his qualifications, but a vote which I felt was important to maintain the tradi-tion of civilian control of the military, an important American tradition which General Mattis himself called a ‘‘fundamental tenet of the American military tradition.’’ As Secretary of Defense, he will be charged with the important task of providing civilian leadership at the De-partment of Defense, the largest agen-cy in our country, and the one tasked with our national defense. New Mexico plays an outsized role in these efforts, beginning with our na-tional labs, that maintain our nuclear weapons and play an important role in multiple defense efforts. In addition, New Mexico is home to three Air Force bases. Kirtland Air Force Base, one of the most diverse in the country, not only plays a lead role in managing our nuclear weapons, but is both the home of state of the art Air Force Research Lab facilities and AFSOC’s premier training wing—the 58th Special Operations Wing. Cannon Air Force Base, home of the 27th Spe-cial Operations Wing, is at the tip of the spear in our efforts to counter ter-rorist threats to the United States. Holloman Air Force Base, which was recently selected to receive additional F–16s, continues a proud tradition of training our future F–16 pilots. Fur-thermore, White Sands Missile Range, which is utilized by all our services, is the premier testing facility in the country. Finally, New Mexico also shares the Army’s Ft. Bliss with our neighbor El Paso. I would encourage Secretary Mattis to visit New Mexico as soon as possible to learn more about how New Mexico supports our Nation’s military.

THANKING FORMER PRESIDENT OBAMA Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise to offer my words of gratitude to Presi-dent Obama as his service to our Na-tion comes to a close. I want to com-mend him for his 8 years of dedicated public service. From the first time we met in 2005, I was struck by his integ-rity, his intellect and his decency. His achievements as President are too nu-merous to list, but 3 are significant. Over 15 million jobs created since the end of the great recession, 20 million more Americans with health care, and a $1 trillion reduction in the deficit. President Obama was a strong fighter for the middle class and the vulnerable. Our Nation and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania are in a stronger position today than when President Obama took the oath of office in January 2009. As a nation, we have made progress, but we still face substantial challenges in order to grow incomes, provide a quality education for more children, and keep our nation safe. We will miss President Obama’s principled leader-ship and enduring commitment to strengthening America. Mr. President, I ask unaimous con-sent that a CNN article about Presi-dent Obama be printed in the R
ECORD . There being no objection, the mate-rial was ordered to be printed in the R

BAMA ’SGIFT TO TRUMP : A ‘P RETTY SOLID’ E
CONOMY  (by Heather Long) President Obama is giving President-elect Trump a welcome gift: A pretty good econ-omy. Unemployment is at its lowest level since 2007. Home prices are back at all-time highs. Growth is picking up. The economy ex-panded at a 3.2% annual rate from July through September. Even the middle class is (finally) getting a raise in pay. ‘‘President Trump really is inheriting an economy that’s pretty solid,’’ said Kevin Hassett, an economist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, on CNBC Fri-day. The ‘‘Obama economy’’ deserves a ‘‘B or B+’’ grade, says Paul Ashworth, chief econo-mist at Capital Economics. 
GRADING THE OBAMA ECONOMY  That’s not an A, but the economy is cer-tainly better off than it was when Obama walked into the Oval Office in 2009. Back then, the country was in the midst of a deep financial crisis and recession. The very month Obama took office, nearly 800,000 Americans lost their jobs. Obama believes he hasn’t received enough credit for the big turnaround. ‘‘Anyone claiming that America’s economy is in de-cline is peddling fiction,’’ Obama said earlier this year. Unemployment has fallen dramatically from 10% to just 4.6% now. America has gained over 11 million new jobs since Obama took office. TRUMP POINTS TO THOSE LEFT BEHIND IN  
RECOVERY  Trump has repeatedly called the unem-ployment rate ‘‘a joke’’ and ‘‘a hoax.’’ It’s unclear whether he will change that message when he takes office. Then he would be able to take credit for keeping unemployment down—or even causing it to go lower. For now, Trump continues to hammer the Obama economy as terrible. ‘‘Companies are not going to leave the United States any-more without consequences,’’ Trump said at a speech at a Carrier factory in Indianapolis, Indiana. ‘‘We’re losing so much.’’ While hiring has picked up rapidly under President Obama—2014 and 2015 were the best years of job growth since the late 1990s—the gains have almost all come in the so-called ‘‘service sector,’’ not in manufacturing and blue collar work. ‘‘There are some people doing fabulously well and others on death’s doorstep. And there’s a heck of a gulf in between,’’ says Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate.com. The U.S. has 54,000 fewer manufacturing jobs now than a year ago, according to the Labor Department. Trump is trying to stem that decline. He and vice President-elect Mike Pence nego-tiated a deal with Carrier to keep about 1,000 jobs in Indiana. Some of those jobs would have gone to Mexico. The Obama team counters that 1,000 jobs is small compared to the 178,000 jobs added in November alone. It was the 74th consecutive month of job gains under Obama. 
CAN TRUMP DO BETTER ? Trump and his new team of economic ad-visers promise to hypercharge U.S. growth. They say they can get it to 4%—stronger than recent years when the economy has grown only 2%. The question is how. Trump wants big tax cuts for businesses and individuals. He’s also planning to roll back regulation and spend more on roads and bridges. Wall Street has given these plans a big thumbs up. The stock market rallied to record levels in November after Trump won the presidency. Business and consumer con-fidence has also shot up since the momen-tous win. 
THE BIG PROBLEM FOR TRUMP  There’s just one catch: The U.S. economy has less potential to grow now than in the past, argues economist Ashworth. Two key factors drive growth: More people entering the workforce and workers being more productive on the job. Right now, the U.S. has an aging popu-lation and little appetite for much more im-migration, so it’s hard to see more workers flooding into the workforce. Trump likes to claim 94 million Americans are out of work and need jobs, but that’s not correct. That number includes retirees, people in school and those who have chosen not to work in order to take care of their family. In reality, about 2.1 million lost their jobs in recent years and appear to have simply given up looking. They are the hidden unem-ployed. Getting them jobs won’t be easy as many jobs today require specialized skills. Trump’s big hope is to get productivity up by encouraging businesses to invest more in

their factories, research and workers. Busi-ness investment has been one of the missing parts of the recovery. ‘‘We’re not quite there yet, but we’ve made a considerable amount of progress,’’ says Ashworth. f 
REMEMBERING KEN HECHLER Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, today I wish to honor Ken Hechler, a former Presidential adviser, veteran, public servant, author, Congressman, West Virginia’s 26th Secretary of State, and educator who left a significant imprint on my home State of West Virginia. Ken was born on September 20, 1914, in Roslyn, NY. Always a staunch advo-cate for engaging the public in politics, he helped organize support for Presi-dent Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal while attending Swarthmore College. He later earned a master’s degree and Ph.D. in political science, both from Columbia University. Shortly after the United States en-tered World War II, Ken was drafted into the Army where he trained as an infantryman and a tank commander. Eventually he was assigned as an Army combat historian and rose to the rank of colonel. He was one of five people as-signed to interview leaders of Nazi Ger-many after the war. His experience as a war historian led to his joining the Truman administra-tion as an adviser on local issues dur-ing his tours across the Nation. He re-mained on Truman’s administration throughout the remainder of his tenure and briefly into the administration of Dwight D. Eisenhower. He was the author of ‘‘The Bridge at Remagen,’’ which detailed the Army’s crossing of the Rhine River during World War II. This publication helped make him a household name. Ken later joined the American Polit-ical Science Association, with one of his jobs requiring him to find political science professors for colleges. His leg-acy in West Virginia began in 1957 when he got a request to teach polit-ical science at Marshall College, now Marshall University. Following one term at Marshall, he ran for Congress and won. He served nine terms in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1957 to 1977. He saw West Virginia for the wel-coming place it is. Once you have vis-ited our little State, it never really leaves you. Most importantly, Ken rec-ognized quickly the issues that matter in West Virginia—mostly concerning the coal industry and protection of our miners. In the wake of the explosion at the Consol No. 9 mine in my hometown of Farmington, Ken played a key role in the promotion of the Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969. I person-ally lost many individuals who I knew well, including my dear Uncle John and several classmates, in that explosion. The implementation of the Coal Mine Health and Safety Act set the ground-work for everything we have accom-plished for our miners since then. I will always be grateful for Ken’s contribu-tions. Among his many history-making leg-acies, Ken joined the march to Selma with the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., in 1965. He was the only active Member of Congress to participate. After a successful tenure in Congress, Ken served as West Virginia’s Sec-retary of State. He moved his desk out front so he could interact with visitors passing through. He loved to visit with all West Virginians. He fought for transparency in our campaign finance system, was passionate about pro-tecting our democratic process, and fought to ensure that West Virginians had access to cast their ballots. Ken never gave up his commitment to public service and continued to be active on the issues that matter to the public. At the age of 85, he walked 530 miles with Granny D to show his un-wavering commitment to campaign fi-nance reform, shortly after the McCain-Feingold Act passed Congress. Put simply, Ken was never one to back down from a challenge. The man was fearless and fought tirelessly for causes he believed in. What is most important is that he lived a full life, surrounded by dear friends and family. It is my hope that Ken’s loved ones are able to find peace, strength, and support in one another. This is a time to celebrate his life and vast accomplishments, as well as the countless lives he touched, and to honor his memory in our thoughts and prayers. Again, I extend my most sincere con-dolences to his loving wife, Carol, and the entire Hechler family and dear friends. I am honored to join the people of West Virginia and beyond in recog-nizing his memory, as well as the un-wavering love he had for his loved ones and our great Nation. His legacy of service will live on forever.

REMEMBERING TIM MITCHELL Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I have said many times that the Senate is a family, and today we are a family in mourning. Tim Mitchell, the assistant Democratic secretary and a 25-year Senate staffer, lost his battle with brain cancer this past Saturday night. It was a battle he waged with uncom-mon courage and grace. We are discon-solate that such an outstanding person in the prime of his life has been taken from his family and from the Senate. We send our deepest condolences and prayers to his beloved wife Alicia; his cherished son Ben; his father, the Rev-erend Dr. Philip Mitchell; his sister Christi; and the rest of his family and many, many friends. While Tim spent part of his forma-tive years in Binghamton, NY, he was born in Boston and also grew up in New Hampshire, so he ultimately pledged his sports allegiance to Boston and New England. He called himself a P-K— a preacher’s kid. He earned his under-graduate degree from the State Univer-sity of New York at Fredonia. He earned his juris doctor degree at night while he worked here in the Senate, from Catholic University’s Columbus School of Law. Tim loved his family most of all, but he also loved the Sen-ate, and he loved the Boston Red Sox— I am not sure of the order there; maybe they were tied. He actually acquired two seats from Fenway Park and put them in his basement for when he wanted to watch a game. They were just part of his extensive collection of Red Sox memorabilia, hats, ties, and the like. I don’t think any other fan was as excited and as proud as Tim was when the Red Sox won the World Series in 2004, ending an 86-year drought. Tim started his Senate career fol-lowing his junior year in college as an intern for then-Senator Don Riegle from Michigan. He returned to the Sen-ate after he graduated to work as a staff assistant in Senator Riegle’s of-fice, where he quickly displayed his talents and work ethic and was pro-moted to a job on the Senate Banking Committee. Later, he worked on the special Whitewater Committee. He also worked for former Democratic Leader Tom Daschle, on his personal staff and on the Democratic Policy Committee, before joining the floor staff in 2001. As a member of the floor staff, Tim was intimately involved in every bill, every nomination, every accomplish-ment of the Senate. Throughout it all, he was always calm, always patient, al-ways courteous, and always exhibiting his innate sense of decency and fair-ness. He was a parliamentary expert and a trusted adviser. I hope Tim’s wife Alicia, his son Ben, and his other family members know just how much Tim was loved and re-spected here in the Senate. Given the partisan nature of his job, that is, per-haps, the best testament to the type of person Tim was. Our hearts, like theirs, are broken. I hope they may find some solace in these words written by the Reverend Henry Scott Holland, originally as a sermon, but usually re-printed as a poem: 
Death is nothing at all. It does not count. I have only slipped away into the next room. Nothing has happened. Everything remains exactly as it was. I am I, and you are you, and the old life that we lived so fondly together is un-touched, unchanged. Whatever we were to each other, that we are still. Call me by the old familiar name. Speak of me in the easy way which you al-ways used. Put no difference into your tone. Wear no forced air of solemnity or sorrow. Laugh as we always laughed at the little jokes that we enjoyed together. Play, smile, think of me, pray for me. Let my name be ever the household word that it always was. Let it be spoken without an effort, without the ghost of a shadow upon it. Life means all that it ever meant. It is the same as it ever was. There is absolute and unbroken continuity. What is this death but a negligible accident?

STATE OF THE UNION ESSAY CONTEST WINNERS ∑Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, since 2010, I have sponsored a State of the Union essay contest for Vermont stu-dents. The contest, now in its 7th year, is an opportunity for Vermont’s high school students to articulate what issues they would prioritize if they were President of the United States. A panel of Vermont teachers reviewed all of the essays submitted and selected the top 20. I would like to congratulate each and every finalist and to specifically ac-knowledge Quinn Nelson Mayo as this year’s winner of the contest. I would also like to recognize Musa Mayange for placing second and A.J. DeFelice for placing third. I ask to have printed in the R
ECORD the winning essays. The material follows: 
QUINN NELSON MAYO , ST. JOHNSBURY ACADEMY  
JUNIOR (WINNER)  The United States was founded on several core values; the most important, as most of us agree, is freedom. This shared belief has been the foundation of our country for over 200 years. And for centuries, media has been a major outlet for people to exercise this freedom because it allows them to share their opinions with the masses. The idea of free speech took on a different meaning with the development of the internet in the late 80s. Since then, this liberty has grown expo-nentially. Now people have the ability to share their thoughts with a much larger au-dience. It is possible to do this anonymously and without fear of consequence. The inter-net is an incredible asset which has helped with globalization and the spread of informa-tion. However, this form of media does have its drawbacks. The leading issue is that it enables the spread of false information. So, while the internet embodies our nation’s core value of freedom, it can also be detri-mental to another vital aspect of our soci-ety: educated and well informed citizens. Regardless of one’s political views, we can all agree that 2016 has been a tumultuous year for politics, here in the United States and across the globe. The 2016 presidential campaign was a dramatic affair, and just the opening act to one of the most high-stakes elections in our country’s history. The ac-tions and rhetoric of the president-elect have inspired a great political shift, as well as a burgeoning sense of xenophobia and hatred throughout the country. During times such as these, it is important to focus on what we can do to create a better future. Much of the hate directed towards certain groups of peo-ple is due to ignorance and can be traced back to stereotypes perpetrated by unreli-able media sources. Forcing media sites to drastically increase their censorship would rightfully anger their users, on the grounds that it restricts their constitutional right to free speech. Therefore, the most plausible and effective solution to the problem of mis-information is to educate people. As of this year, 78% of the United States population has a social media profile (Statista). Facebook and Twitter have bil-lions of users across the world. It is impera-tive that we use such sites with care. The re-cent controversies over fake news have made the influence of the media on politics in-creasingly apparent. The rumor now known as ‘‘Pizzagate’’ is a prime example of a fake news story with tremendous influence. Mil-lions of people believed that Hillary Clinton was involved in a child-prostitution ring run out of a pizza parlor. This is because, for a vast number of people, social media and bi-ased news sources are their only ways of ac-quiring information. In fact, it is estimated that 62% of American adults use social media at least occasionally as a news source (Pew Research Center). However, many blindly make the assumption that it is accu-rate. When hundreds of thousands of people are susceptible to hate-driven fake news, it can have a huge impact on our democracy. This is why I propose the incorporation of media literacy as a core subject in all public schools. Public schools educate the majority of our nation’s children. Which is why, by teaching America’s youth how to approach sources impartially and critically, we can fix this problem of misinformation. Integrating media literacy as a required course at ele-mentary and high-school levels is an invest-ment in our future generations. MUSA MAYANGE , WINOOSKI HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR  
(SECOND PLACE)  Twelve years and still no change. After fleeing from a civil war in Somalia in 1992, my parents took refuge at a refugee camp in Kakuma, Kenya. After 12 years of struggle, in 2004 we flew from the National Airport of Kenya to J.F.K. International Airport in New York thinking our lives were saved. Fi-nally here, the land of the free and the home of the brave. One of the only places on earth where you can taste opportunity and smell a second chance. At the age of 17, I can see it now. America’s resistance to change. Racism exists in America. Surveys reveal that whites apply stereotypical thinking about blacks, considering them lazy and un-intelligent. What are we going to do about these attitudes towards persons of color? The American National Election Studies asked voters to rank blacks and whites from hardworking to lazy, from intelligent to un-intelligent. In 2012, 62 percent of whites gave blacks a lower score in at least one area. In 2008, 45 percent of whites expressed negative feelings about black stereotypes. (Milbank, Washington Post) For a while, we thought that the issue of racism was over and that our nation was going to move forward and ‘‘leave the past in the past.’’ It almost had me fooled because we live in Vermont and we sometimes can be isolated from world issues. But racism is still here. When everyone thought that it was no longer ‘‘relevant,’’ it’s still alive. As a young African-American immigrant, how can I wrap my head around this? As Vermonters how can we annihilate racism and get our community to be accepting of all races, cultures, and ethnic backgrounds? Ta-Nehisi Coates addresses the disadvan-tages of living with black skin in Between the World And Me. Coates says ‘‘. . . today, when 8% of the world’s prisoners are black men, our race has been refinanced to the Dream of being white. Black life is cheap, but in America, black bodies are a natural resource of incomparable value.’’ Black peo-ple are born with a disadvantage. We are more likely to go jail than white people. The Center for American Progress says, ‘‘In the United States, black people account for 60 percent of those imprisoned. The prison pop-ulation grew by 700 percent from 1970 to 2005, a rate that is outpacing crime and popu-lation rates. Black people make up 17% of the United States population yet more of us are in jail. A black man is twice as likely to go to jail than a white man, even if they did the same crime. Racism was born when humans identified skin color as a positive or negative factor. If each of us could accept that we are all hu-mans, we come from different places, and have different interests, we could accept ra-cial differences, but not let them divide us. We will never move forward if we don’t work together side by side and knock down obsta-cles. AJ DEFELICE , HARTFORD HIGH SCHOOL  
FRESHMAN (THIRD PLACE)  The United States is one of the greatest countries on Earth, prized for its natural beauty, economic opportunities, and demo-cratic principles. However, many challenges face our nation. Among the most pressing issues are climate change, immigration, and income inequality. Perhaps the most daunting problem we face is climate change, and the crucial role our country plays in it. Although President Obama recently signed the Paris Agreement to limit greenhouse gas emissions, much must still be done to combat this issue. We can begin by putting unemployed or low-in-come Americans to work—manufacturing, transporting, and installing renewable en-ergy products—such as solar panels, wind turbines, and more. This would produce a similar effect as the New Deal put into place by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to com-bat the negative effects of the Great Depres-sion. Additionally, a carbon tax should be es-tablished nationally, to lower emissions, and encourage the usage of renewable energy. A carbon tax would also allow for tax reduc-tions in other areas, and combined with em-ploying Americans to transition to wide-spread renewable energy, would create eco-nomic growth, while simultaneously reduc-ing our carbon footprint. Another controversial issue which troubles our nation is immigration. The United States is a country built on the backs of im-migrants, and to deny a path to citizenship to millions who long only for a higher qual-ity of life is unpatriotic. We must stop dehu-manizing these people and see them only for who they are—people. Immigrants strength-en our economy, whether it be as producers, consumers, or developers. To deny them ac-cess to citizenship in our nation would be de-priving ourselves of economic growth and cultural diversity. Economic and cultural change that would only strengthen American society. Income inequality is another issue which plagues our nation today. According to countless years of research, income inequal-ity has a direct correlation on social and health issues. A study conducted by the Uni-versity of Wisconsin found that people who reside in more financially unequal commu-nities are more likely to die before the age of 75. As national income inequality decreases, so do social and health problems. This de-cline can be seen in Scandinavian countries, where having a more equal gross domestic product per capita results in a higher quality of life. To make this possible for the United States, corporations must be regulated and held accountable by lawmakers to be sure that the American people are receiving the representation they deserve. As citizens, we must be responsible in electing officials who will place the needs of the greater population

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. B
LUMENTHAL , Mr. T ILLIS , Ms. K
LOBUCHAR , Mr. C ORNYN , Mr. L
EAHY , Mr. B ENNET , and Mrs. F
EINSTEIN . S. 178. A bill to prevent elder abuse and exploitation and improve the jus-tice system’s response to victims in elder abuse and exploitation cases; to the Committee on the Judiciary. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. Pisesident, I have fought for years to protect our Nation’s seniors from abuse and exploi-tation, initially, as former Chairman of the Senate Aging Committee, former Chairman of the Senate Finance Com-mittee, and more recently, as Chair-man of the Senate Judiciary Com-mittee. This past June, I chaired a Judiciary Committee hearing on Protecting Older Americans from Financial Ex-ploitation. At the hearing, we heard about numerous scams in which seniors were targeted time after time, result-ing in their being defrauded, often with devastating consequences. We also heard that many older Americans don’t report instances of elder abuse or ex-ploitation due to embarrassment, a re-fusal to acknowledge that they were victimized, or reliance on the perpe-trator as their caretaker. Sadly, these accounts of elder abuse are nothing new. What has changed is that the scams targeting seniors are becoming increasingly sophisticated. That is one of the reasons why elder fi-nancial exploitation has been dubbed ‘‘the crime of the 21st century.’’ I have made it a top priority to get the Federal Government to step up its efforts to fight the abuse, neglect, and financial exploitation of our Nation’s seniors. Last year, I called on the Justice De-partment to outline its efforts to pre-vent and respond to instances of elder abuse. First, I sent a letter to the De-partment to find out what it’s doing to protect seniors from a new and particu-larly troubling form of exploitation: the photographing and online publica-tion of nursing home residents in em-barrassing and compromising situa-tions. I also sent a letter to inquire about the Department’s efforts to fight im-poster scams, in which fraudsters pose as employees of the IRS or another government agency, in order to deprive ordinary Americans of millions of dol-lars of their hard earned money. And as tax season approaches once again, it’s critical that folks watch out for these deceitful scams. I also asked about the data the De-partment is collecting on financial ex-ploitation, as well as how this data is being used to support Federal efforts to protect America’s seniors. In its response to my inquiries, the Justice Department effectively admit-ted that it falls short in several re-spects. The Department said that it ‘‘does not collect data on the preva-lence of elder financial exploitation na-tionwide.’’ Further, the Department said that it can’t provide statistical in-formation on the number of cases it has prosecuted for elder financial ex-ploitation. What all this means is that we are not getting the full picture of elder fi-nancial exploitation. We do know that some older Ameri-cans’ trusting and polite nature, com-bined with their hard-earned retire-ment savings, make them particularly attractive targets for fraudsters. We also know that the abuse and exploi-tation of older Americans is on the rise and it can take many forms. Financial exploitation is the most widespread form of elder abuse, costing America’s seniors between an esti-mated $2.9 billion and $36 billion annu-ally. But, sadly, its costs aren’t limited to the negative effect on seniors’ bank accounts. Victims suffer all sorts of negative effects, including diminished health, loss of independence, and psy-chological distress. It is estimated that up to 37 percent of seniors in the United States are af-fected by some form of financial exploi-tation in any 5-year period. In my home State of Iowa, so-called grandparent scams are on the rise. In these scams, fraudsters present them-selves to an older American as a grand-child in distress, hoping to convince the grandparent to send cash or give out a credit card number. Con artists are also using sweep-stakes scams to steal money from sen-iors. A senior is called and told they have won a prize or sum of money. But before they can claim the supposed prize, the victim is required to pay taxes or processing fees. Once the money is paid to cover the taxes and fees, however, no prize ever material-izes. Other instances of elder financial ex-ploitation are more personal in nature and have especially devastating effects. Some victims are pressured into sign-ing over a deed, modifying a will, or giving a power of attorney. Americans have lost their farms, homes, and life savings to this form of fraud. In short, elder abuse and exploitation is a serious problem, and it demands a strong response. It requires all of us to work together in a collaborative way. So, today I am proud to introduce the Elder Abuse Prevention and Pros-ecution Act. I thank my colleagues— Senators BLUMENTHAL , T ILLIS , K LO-
BUCHAR , and C ORNYN for collaborating with me on this comprehensive and bi-partisan bill’s development and for joining as original cosponsors. It takes a multi-pronged approach to com-bating the abuse and financial exploi-tation of our nation’s senior citizens. We have heard a need for specialized prosecutors and more focused efforts to combat abuse and exploitation. That is why the bill directs the Attorney Gen-eral to designate at least one federal prosecutor in each U.S. Attorney’s Of-fice to serve as an Elder Justice Coor-dinator for that district. To ensure that elder abuse is a pri-ority for the Federal Trade Commis-sion and the Justice Department, the bill also calls for each agency to have an Elder Justice Coordinator. We also need to send a strong mes-sage that efforts to target our Nation’s seniors won’t be tolerated. That is why the bill enhances elder victims’ access to restitution and increases penalties for criminals who use telemarketing or email in their schemes to defraud sen-iors. The bill also requires that the Jus-tice Department partner with the De-partment of Health and Human Serv-ices to provide training and technical assistance to State and local govern-ments on the investigation, prevention, prosecution, and mitigation of elder abuse and neglect. Finally we have heard about the need for more data on financial exploitation

and the government’s response. Gath-ering accurate information about elder abuse is not only crucial to under-standing the scope of the problem, but it is also essential in determining where resources should be allocated. So, the bill helps to accomplish that. It requires that data be collected from federal prosecutors and law en-forcement in cases where an older American was the target of abuse or exploitation. These and other reforms included in the bill are the product of a truly bi-partisan effort, as well as insight from key stakeholders and those who’ve been battling elder financial exploi-tation on the front lines. This 21st century crime requires a 21st century response. The Elder Abuse Prevention and Prosecution Act takes a strong step toward protecting our Na-tion’s seniors, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

S. R ES. 15 Whereas section 104(f) of the Foreign As-sistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2151b(f)) (com-monly referred to as the ‘‘Helms amend-ment’’) states that no foreign assistance funds may be used to pay for the perform-ance of abortion as a method of family plan-ning or to motivate or coerce any person to practice abortions; Whereas section 518 of the Foreign Oper-ations, Export Financing, and Related Pro-grams Appropriations Act, 2006 (Public Law 109–102; 119 Stat. 2202) (commonly referred to as the ‘‘Siljander Amendment’’) states that no foreign assistance funds may be used to lobby for or against abortion; Whereas, in 1984, President Ronald Reagan established the ‘‘Mexico City Policy,’’ which prohibits foreign aid for family planning pur-poses from being given to foreign nongovern-mental organizations that perform abortions or actively promote abortion as a method of family planning, regardless of the source of funding; Whereas, upon assuming office on January 20, 1989, President George H.W. Bush contin-ued to enforce the Mexico City Policy as es-tablished by President Reagan; Whereas the Mexico City Policy was rees-tablished on January 22, 2001, by President George W. Bush; and Whereas, on January 23, 2009, President Barack Obama rescinded the Mexico City Policy: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that— (1) the President should immediately re-apply and consider improving the Mexico City Policy; and (2) Congress should expeditiously consider statutory changes that permanently codify the Mexico City Policy or an improved version thereof. f SENATE RESOLUTION 16—TO CON-STITUTE THE MAJORITY PAR-TY’S MEMBERSHIP ON CERTAIN COMMITTEES FOR THE ONE HUN-DRED FIFTEENTH CONGRESS, OR UNTIL THEIR SUCCESSORS ARE CHOSEN Mr. M

Mr. BLUNT. Thank you all. If you have a seat, you can sit down. Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, Mr. President-elect, Mr. Vice President-elect, la-dies and gentlemen, welcome to the inau-guration of the 45th President of the United States of America. Today, the legislative, the executive, and the judicial branches of our constitutional government come together for the inaugura-tion of the 45th President of the United States. Millions of people all over the world will watch and will listen to this event. (Applause.) Thirty-six years ago, at his first inaugura-tion—it was also the first inauguration on this side of the Capitol—President Ronald Reagan said that what we do here is both commonplace and miraculous—commonplace every 4 years since 1789, when President George Washington took this exact same oath; miraculous because we have done it every 4 years since 1789 and the example it sets for democracies everywhere. Wash-ington believed the inauguration of the sec-ond President would be more important than the inauguration of the first. Many people had taken control of a government up until then, but few people had ever turned that control willingly over to anyone else. As important as the first transfer of power was, many historians believe that the next election was even more important, when in 1801 one group of people—arguably, for the first time ever in history—willingly, if not enthusiastically, gave control of the govern-ment to people they believed had a dramati-cally different view of what the government would, should, and could do. After an election that actually discovered a flaw in the Constitution itself, which was remedied by the 12th Amendment, Thomas Jefferson at that inauguration, beyond the chaos of the election that had just passed, said: ‘‘We are all Republicans; we are all Fed-eralists.’’ After 4 years of Civil War, Lincoln’s second inaugural speech tried to find reason for the continued war when he pointed out that both sides ‘‘prayed to the same God.’’ He had ear-lier written about those fervent prayers that ‘‘one side must be and both sides may be wrong,’’ but in 1865 he looked to the future— and the memorable moment in that speech was—‘‘with malice toward none and charity for all.’’ In the middle of the Depression, the coun-try was told that the only thing we had to fear was fear itself. President Kennedy talked about the obligation in a democracy to country. The great question that day was ‘‘ask what you can do for your country.’’ So we come to this place again, commonplace and miraculous, a national moment of cele-bration but not a celebration of victory, a celebration of democracy. (Applause.) As we begin that celebration, I call on His Eminence Timothy Michael Cardinal Dolan, Reverend Dr. Samuel Rodriguez, and Pastor Paula White-Cain to provide readings and the invocation. Cardinal DOLAN. The prayer of King Sol-omon from the Book of Wisdom. Let us pray. God of our ancestors and Lord of mercy, You have made all things, and in Your provi-dence have charged us to rule the creatures produced by You, to govern the world in ho-liness and righteousness and to render judg-ment with integrity of heart. Give us wis-dom, for we are Your servants, weak and short lived, lacking in comprehension of judgment and of laws. Indeed, though one might be perfect among mortals, if wisdom which comes from You be lacking, we count for nothing. Now with You is wisdom who knows Your will and was there when You made the world, who understands what is pleasing in Your eyes, what is conformable with Your commands. Send her forth from Your holy heavens. From Your glorious throne dispatch her that she may be with us and work with us that we may grasp what is pleasing to You, for she knows and under-stands all things and will guide us prudently in our affairs and safeguard us by her glory. Amen. Reverend RODRIGUEZ. From the Gospel of Matthew, the fifth chapter: God blesses those who are poor and realize their need for Him, for the kingdom of heav-en is theirs. God blesses those who mourn for they will be comforted. God blesses those who are humble, for they will inherit the Earth. God blesses those who hunger and thirst for justice, for they will be satisfied. God blesses those who are merciful, for they will be shown mercy. He blesses those who are pure in heart, for they will see God. God blesses those who work for peace, for they will be called children of God. God blesses those who are persecuted for doing right, for the Kingdom of Heaven is theirs. And God blesses you when people mock you and per-secute you and lie about you and say all sorts of evil things against you because you are my followers, for you are the light of the world, like a city on a hilltop that cannot be hidden. No one lights a lamp and then puts it under a basket. Instead, a lamp is placed on its stand where it gives light to everyone in the house. In the same way, let your good deeds shine out for all to see, that everyone will praise your heavenly Father. Respectfully in Jesus’s name. Pastor WHITE-CAIN. We come to You, Heavenly Father, in the Name of Jesus, with grateful hearts, thanking You for this great country that You have decreed to Your peo-ple. We acknowledge we are a blessed nation with a rich history of faith and fortitude, with a future that is filled with promise and purpose. We recognize that every good and every perfect gift comes from You and the United States of America is Your gift, for which we proclaim our gratitude. As a nation, we now pray for our President, Donald John Trump, Vice President Michael Richard Pence, and their families. We ask that You would bestow upon our President the wisdom necessary to lead this great Na-tion, the grace to unify us, and the strength to stand for what is honorable and right in Your sight. In Proverbs 21:1, You instruct us that our leader’s heart is in Your hands. Gracious God, reveal to our President the ability to know Your will, the confidence to lead us in justice and righteousness, and the compas-sion to yield to our better angels. While we know there are many challenges before us, in every generation You have pro-vided us the strength and power to become that blessed Nation. Guide us in discern-ment, Lord, and give us that strength to per-severe and thrive. Now bind and heal our wounds and divisions and join our Nation to Your purpose. ‘‘Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done,’’ the Psalmist declared. Let Your favor be upon this one nation under God. Let these United States of America be that beacon of hope to all people and nations under Your dominion, a true hope for humankind. Glory to the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. We pray this in the Name of Jesus Christ. Amen. (Performance by the Missouri State Uni-versity Chorale.) (Applause.) Mr. BLUNT. Well, the Missouri State Uni-versity Chorale practices and performs about two blocks from my home in Springfield, MO. So it was easy to find them. We are pleased they are here. It is also a great opportunity for me to in-troduce my colleague, the Senator from New York, C
HUCK SCHUMER . Mr. SCHUMER. My fellow Americans, we live in a challenging and tumultuous time— a quickly evolving, evermore interconnected world; a rapidly changing economy that ben-efits too few while leaving too many behind; a fractured media; a politics frequently con-sumed by rancor. We face threats foreign and domestic. In such times, faith in our govern-ment, our institutions, and even our country can erode. Despite these challenges, I stand here today confident in this great country for one reason: you, the American people. (Applause.) We Americans have always been a forward- looking, problem-solving, optimistic, patri-otic, and decent people. Whatever our race, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, whether we are immigrant or native-born, whether we live with disabilities or do not, in wealth or in poverty, we are all excep-tional in our commonly held yet fierce devo-tion to our country and in our willingness to sacrifice our time, energy, and even our lives to making it a more perfect union. Today, we celebrate one of democracies core attributes—the peaceful transfer of power. Every day, we stand up for core demo-cratic principles enshrined in the Constitu-tion; the rule of law; equal protection for all under the law; the freedom of speech, press, religion—the things that make America ‘‘America.’’ We can gain strength from read-ing our history and listening to the voices of average Americans. They always save us in times of strife. (Applause.) One such American was MAJ Sullivan Ballou. On July 14, 1861, when the North and South were lining up for their first battle, a time when our country was bitterly divided and faith in the future of our country was at a nadir, Major Ballou of the 2nd Rhode Is-land volunteers penned a letter to his wife Sarah. It is one of the greatest letters in Amer-ican history. It shows the strength and cour-age of the average American. Allow me to read some of his words which echo through the ages. My very dear Sarah [he wrote], the indica-tions are very strong that we should move in a few days—perhaps tomorrow. If it is necessary that I should fall on the battlefield for my country, I am ready. I have no misgivings about, or lack of con-fidence in, the cause in which I am engaged, and my courage does not halt or falter. I know how strongly American Civilization now leans upon the triumph of the Govern-ment, and how great a debt we owe to those who went before us through the blood and suffering of the Revolution. And I am will-ing—perfectly willing—to lay down all my joys in this life, to help maintain this Gov-ernment and to pay that debt. Sarah, my love for you is deathless, it seems to bind me to you with mighty cables that nothing but Omnipotence could break; and yet my love of country comes over me like a strong wind and bears me irresistibly on with all these chains to the battlefield.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES364 January 20, 2017 
Sullivan Ballou gave his life on the battle-field a week later at the first Battle of Bull Run. It is because Sullivan Ballou and count-less others believed in something bigger than themselves and were willing to sacrifice for it that we stand today in the full blessings of liberty in the greatest country on Earth. That spirit lives on in each of us, Americans whose families have been here for genera-tions and those who have just arrived. I know our best days are yet to come. I urge all Americans to read Ballou’s full letter. His words give me solace and strength. I hope they will give you the same. (Applause.) Now, please stand while the Associate Jus-tice of the Supreme Court, Clarence Thomas, administers the oath of office to the Vice President of the United States. Associate Justice CLARENCE THOMAS administered to the Vice President-elect the oath of office prescribed by the Constitution, which he repeated, as follows: I, MICHAEL RICHARD PENCE, do sol-emnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion, and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God. Associate Justice THOMAS. God bless you. (Applause.) (Performance by the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, accompanied by the United States Marine Band.) (Applause.) Mr. BLUNT. Ladies and gentlemen, it is an honor to introduce the Chief Justice of the United States, John G. Roberts, Jr. The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, JOHN G. ROBERTS, JR., administered to the President-elect the oath of office pre-scribed by the Constitution, which he re-peated, as follows: I, DONALD JOHN TRUMP, do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States and will, to the best of my ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. So help me God. The Chief Justice. Congratulations, Mr. President. (Applause.) Mr. BLUNT. What a great honor to be able to introduce for the first time ever, any-where, the 45th President of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump. (Applause.) The PRESIDENT. Chief Justice Roberts, President Carter, President Clinton, Presi-dent Bush, President Obama, fellow Ameri-cans, and people of the world, thank you. We, the citizens of America, are now joined in a great national effort to rebuild our country and restore its promise for all of our people. Together we will determine the course of America and the world for many, many years to come. We will face challenges. We will confront hardships, but we will get the job done. Every 4 years we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power. And we are grateful to President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama for their gracious aid throughout this transi-tion. They have been magnificent. Thank you. (Applause.) Today’s ceremony, however, has very spe-cial meaning because today we are not mere-ly transferring power from one administra-tion to another or from one party to another, but we are transferring power from Wash-ington, DC, and giving it back to you, the people. For too long, a small group in our Nation’s Capital has reaped the rewards of govern-ment while the people have borne the cost. Washington flourished, but the people did not share in its wealth. Politicians pros-pered, but the jobs left and the factories closed. The establishment protected itself, but not the citizens of our country. Their victories have not been your victories. Their triumphs have not been your triumphs, and while they celebrated in our Nation’s Cap-ital, there was little to celebrate for strug-gling families all across our land. That all changes starting right here and right now, because this moment is your mo-ment. It belongs to you. It belongs to every-one gathered here today and everyone watch-ing all across America. This is your day. This is your celebration. This, the United States of America, is your country. (Applause.) What truly matters is not which party con-trols our government but whether our gov-ernment is controlled by the people. January 20, 2017, will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this Nation again. (Applause.) The forgotten men and women of our coun-try will be forgotten no longer. Everyone is listening to you now. You came by the tens of millions to become part of a historic movement, the likes of which the world has never seen before. At the center of this mo-ment is a crucial conviction that a nation exists to serve its citizens. Americans want great schools for their children, safe neigh-borhoods for their families, and good jobs for themselves. (Applause.) These are just and reasonable demands of righteous people and a righteous public. But for too many of our citizens, a different re-ality exists: mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities, rusted-out fac-tories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our Nation, an education sys-tem flush with cash but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of all knowledge, the crime and the gangs and the drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized po-tential. This American carnage stops right here and stops right now. We are one Nation and their pain is our pain. Their dreams are our dreams. Their success will be our success. We share one heart, one home, and one glorious destiny. The oath of office I take today is an oath of allegiance to all Americans. For many decades we have enriched foreign in-dustry at the expense of American industry, subsidized the armies of other countries, while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military. We have defended other nations’ borders, while refusing to defend our own, and spent trillions and trillions of dollars overseas while America’s infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay. We have made other countries rich while the wealth, strength, and confidence of our country has dissipated over the horizon. One by one, the factories shuttered and left our shores, with not even a thought about the millions and millions of American work-ers that were left behind. The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed all across the world. But that is the past. Now, we are looking only to the future. We assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, in every foreign capital, and in every hall of power. From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land. From this day forward, it is going to be only America first—America first. Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs will be made to benefit American workers and American families. (Applause.) We must protect our borders from the rav-ages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs. Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength. I will fight for you with every breath in my body, and I will never, ever let you down. America will start winning again, winning like never before. We will bring back our jobs. We will bring back our bor-ders. We will bring back our wealth. We will bring back our dreams. (Applause.) We will build new roads and highways and bridges and airports and tunnels and rail-ways all across our wonderful Nation. We will get our people off of welfare and back to work rebuilding our country with American hands and American labor. We will follow two simple rules: Buy American and hire American. (Applause.) We will seek friendship and good will with the nations of the world, but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first. We do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone but rather to let it shine as an exam-ple. We will shine for everyone to follow. We will reinforce old alliances and form new ones and unite the civilized world against radical Islamic terrorism, which we will eradicate completely from the face of the Earth. (Applause.) At the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to the United States of America, and through our loyalty to our country, we will rediscover our loyalty to each other. When you open your heart to pa-triotism, there is no room for prejudice. The Bible tells us how good and pleasant it is when God’s people live together in unity. We must speak our minds openly, debate our dis-agreements honestly, but always pursue soli-darity. (Applause.) When America is united, America is to-tally unstoppable. There should be no fear. We are protected, and we will always be pro-tected. We will be protected by the great men and women of our military and law en-forcement and, most importantly, we will be protected by God. (Applause.) Finally, we must think big and dream even bigger. In America, we understand that a na-tion is only living as long as it is striving. We will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action, constantly com-plaining but never doing anything about it. The time for empty talk is over. Now arrives the hour of action. Do not allow anyone to tell you that it cannot be done. No challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of America. We will not fail. Our country will thrive and prosper again. (Applause.) We stand at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of space, to free the Earth from the miseries of disease, and to harness the energies, industries, and technologies of tomorrow. A new national pride will stir our soul, lift our sights, and heal our divisions. (Applause.) It is time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget—that whether we are Black or Brown or White, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots. We all enjoy the same glorious freedoms, and we all sa-lute the same great American flag. (Applause.) Whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of Detroit or the windswept plains of Ne-braska, they look up at the same night sky,

they fill their heart with the same dreams, and they are infused with the breath of life by the same Almighty Creator. So to all Americans in every city near and far, small and large, from mountain to mountain, from ocean to ocean, hear these words. You will never be ignored again. Your voice, your hopes, and your dreams will de-fine our American destiny, and your courage and goodness and love will forever guide us along the way. Together, we will make America strong again. We will make Amer-ica wealthy again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And, yes, together we will make America great again. Thank you. God bless you, and God bless America. Thank you. (Applause.) Mr. BLUNT. At this time I call on Rabbi Marvin Hier, the Reverend Franklin Gra-ham, and Bishop Wayne T. Jackson to pro-vide readings and the benediction. Rabbi HIER. Eternal God, bless President Donald J. Trump and America, our great Na-tion. Guide us to remember the words of the Psalmist: Who may dwell on Your holy mountain? One who does what is right and speaks the truth, who knows that when you eat the labor of your hands, you are praiseworthy that he who sows in tears shall reap in joy, because the freedoms we enjoy are not grant-ed in perpetuity, but must be reclaimed by each generation. As our ancestors have planted for us, so we must plant for others. While it is not for us to complete the tasks, neither are we free to desist from them. Dispense justice to the needy and the or-phan, for they have no one but their fellow citizens, and because a nation’s wealth is measured by her values and not by her vaults. Bless all of our allies around the world who share our beliefs. By the rivers of Babylon we wept as we re-membered Zion. If I forget thee O Jerusalem, may my right hand forget its skill. The doer of all these shall never falter. May the days come soon when justice will dwell in the wil-derness and righteousness will abide in the fertile fields, and the work of righteousness will be peace, quietness, and confidence for-ever. Amen. Reverend GRAHAM. Mr. President, in the Bible, rain is a sign of God’s blessing. And it started to rain, Mr. President, when you came to the platform. It is my prayer that God will bless you, your family, your admin-istration, and may He bless America. The passage of Scripture comes from 1 Timothy, chapter 2: I urge them, first of all, that petitions, prayers, intercession, and thanksgiving be made for all people. For kings, for all those in authority, that we may live peacefully quiet lives in all Godliness and Holiness. This is good and it pleases God our Savior, who wants all people to be saved and come to a knowledge of the truth. For there is one God, and one Mediator between God and mankind, the man Christ Jesus who gave Himself as a ransom for all people. Now to the King Eternal, Immortal, Invisible, the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever. In Jesus’s Name. Amen. Bishop JACKSON. We thank You, Father, for letting us share this great moment to-gether. Let us not take for granted the air we breathe or the life You have given us. We were all created by You with one blood, all nations to dwell upon this land together. We are not enemies. We are brothers and sisters. We are not adversaries, but we are allies. We are not foes, but we are friends. Let us be healed by the power of Your love and united by the bond of Your Spirit. Today we pray for our 45th President, the Vice President, and their families, and give them the wisdom to guide this great Nation, the strength to protect it, and the hands to heal it. We bless President Donald J. Trump. We ask that You give him the wisdom of Sol-omon, the vision of Joseph, and the meek-ness of Christ—Solomon who kept peace among many nations, Joseph who dreamt better for the people, and Christ who accept-ed us all. O Lord, mend our hearts and stitch to-gether the fabric of this great country in the spirit of the legendary gospel singer Mahalia Jackson: Oh, deep in my heart, I do believe. The Lord will see us through, I do believe. We are on our way to victory, I do believe. We will walk hand in hand, I do believe. We shall live in peace, I do believe. Oh, deep in my heart, I do believe. America, we shall overcome. May the Lord bless and keep America, make His face shine upon us and be gracious unto us and give us peace. In the mighty Name of Jesus. Amen. (Performance of the National Anthem by Jackie Evancho and the United States Ma-rine Band.) (The Inaugural Ceremony was concluded at 12:27 p.m.) f

HONORING MICHAEL J. KEENAN 
HON. RUBEN GALLEGO 
OF ARIZONA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, January 20, 2017 Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Michael J. Keenan, who is retiring having served the interests of Arizona’s working men and women with distinction since the mid- 1970s. Upon graduating from the University of Ari-zona, Mike attended Georgetown Law School. Not forgetting his working class roots or union family heritage, Mike returned to Arizona to join the union-side law firm then known as Ward and Contreras. Through the years, Mike provided wise counsel to Arizona unions, ena-bling them to defend the rights of the Arizona workers to fair wages and safe working condi-tions. He also has represented well various trust funds which provide health insurance and retirement benefits for Arizona union mem-bers. By advancing the interests and protecting the dignity of Arizona union members—often during challenging times—Mike earned a rep-utation as not only a zealous and highly effec-tive advocate, but also as a highly ethical law-yer. Through his hard work and dedication, Mike immeasurably improved the lives of Ari-zona working men and women. It is now time for Mike to enjoy a long retire-ment with his wife, Becky, his sons Jimmy and Joey, his daughter Katie and his grand-daughter Avery. On behalf of our great state’s workers, I thank him and wish him all the best.

RECOGNIZING THE 27TH ANNIVER-SARY OF ‘‘BLACK JANUARY’’ 
HON. STEVE COHEN 
OF TENNESSEE  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, January 20, 2017 Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 27th anniversary of ‘‘Black Jan-uary’’ in Azerbaijan, a day that commemorates Azerbaijan’s stand against Soviet soldiers for independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity over all lands under Azerbaijani jurisdiction, and freedom from communism and dictator-ship. On the evening of January 19, 1990, the U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet Presidium backed by then-President Mikhail Gorbachev declared a state of emergency in response to the grow-ing national independence movement in Azer-baijan. In response to the Azeri people’s stand against Soviet aggression, Soviet troops stormed the Azerbaijani capital city of Baku and indiscriminately fired on peaceful dem-onstrators, including women and children. That night, more than 130 people died with over 700 injured, 841 arrested and five going miss-ing. While Soviet invaders attacked peaceful protestors, they also targeted critical infra-structure and workers. According to a report by Human Rights Watch entitled Black Janu-ary in Azerbaijan, ‘‘among the most heinous violations of human rights during the Baku in-cursion were the numerous attacks on medical personnel, ambulances and even hospitals.’’ Additionally, the Soviet attack served as an act of intimidation for all then-Soviet countries with independence ambitions. The Human Rights Watch report concluded that, ‘‘indeed the violence used by the Soviet Army on the night of January 19–20 constitutes an exercise in collective punishment. The punishment in-flicted on Baku by Soviet soldiers may have been intended as a warning to nationalists, not only in Azerbaijan, but in other Republics of the Soviet Union.’’ Azerbaijani citizens, however, refused to succumb to Soviet aggression. Instead, the in-vasion gave new life to their nationalism and fight for true independence. In the days after the invasion, thousands of Azerbaijanis sur-rounded Communist Party headquarters de-manding the resignation of the republic’s lead-ership, the Baku City Council demanded that Soviet troops withdraw from Azeri territories and the legislature in Azerbaijan threatened to call a referendum on secession unless Soviet troops were withdrawn within 48 hours. Soviet troops eventually withdrew and Janu-ary 20th became known as ‘‘the Day of the Nationwide Sorrow.’’ It would not be for nearly two years, however, before Azerbaijan gained political control from the Soviet Union. In Octo-ber 1991, Azerbaijan’s parliament—the Na-tional Assembly—declared its independence. While Azerbaijan still faces challenges from its neighbors, today, Azerbaijan has developed into a thriving country with double-digit growth, in large part due to a freely elected president and parliament, and free market reforms led by the energy sector that helps support energy security in Israel and Europe. I ask my col-leagues to join me in recognizing the tragic events of Black January that precipitated the independent Republic of Azerbaijan and the fall of the USSR.

TRIBUTE TO FRANK TAYLOR 
HON. PETER T. KING 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, January 20, 2017 Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an extraordinary public servant and a dedicated leader of the U.S. In-telligence Community (IC), Brigadier General (Retired) Francis Xavier Taylor, the Under Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis at the Department of Homeland Security. Brig Gen Taylor came out of retirement in 2014 when the President nominated him to be the Under Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis (I&A) at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS). After nearly 40 years of honorable service to our nation, Under Secretary Taylor will retire again on Friday, January 20, 2017. Under Secretary Taylor applied his knowl-edge and experience from his 31 years in the United States Air Force, his service at the U.S. Department of State as an Ambassador for Counterterrorism and head of Diplomatic

Security, and as Vice President of Security at General Electric. Applying his decades of ex-perience and innovative thinking, Under Sec-retary Taylor rolled up his sleeves and got to work. Due to Under Secretary Taylor’s leadership, I&A is much further along on its vision of driv-ing information sharing and delivering intel-ligence and analysis to operators and deci-sion-makers at all levels. One of Under Sec-retary Taylor’s first actions at I&A was to guide the organization through a transformation. He removed internal I&A stovepipes and realigned the organization to ensure DHS-collected in-formation now forms the basis of the majority of I&A production. Under Secretary Taylor also ordered that finished intelligence include State and local data. Under Secretary Taylor also worked tire-lessly to mature and strengthen the Depart-ment’s relationship with the state and local fu-sion centers and make information sharing a priority. In FY2016, 62 percent of I&A’s fin-ished intelligence products were disseminated at the SECRET level or below to best serve those who protect our borders, critical infra-structure and communities. Under Secretary Taylor also took to heart the need to invest in the workforce and ad-dress extremely low employee morale. He spent a great deal of his tenure fine-tuning the organization, restructuring and rebalancing the workforce. He drastically reduced the ratio of supervisors to workers, reducing the amount of bloated management and replacing it with what he called ‘‘seed corn’’—young, junior people brought in to rejuvenate the organiza-tion and help develop a truly homeland-fo-cused workforce. Our Nation owes this public servant a tre-mendous debt of gratitude. I wish to thank Under Secretary Taylor for his decades of ex-ceptional service to our country and to wish him and his wife Connie the very best in the days and years ahead. Under Secretary Tay-lor can now enjoy his three grandchildren Ava, Aaron and Alexander, while taking in some more games under the Golden Dome at Notre Dame.
