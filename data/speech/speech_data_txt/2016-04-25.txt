EARMR. SPEAKER : On April 20, 2016, pur-suant to section 3307 of Title 40, United States Code, the Committee on Transpor-tation and Infrastructure met in open ses-sion to consider two resolutions included in the General Services Administration’s Cap-ital Investment and Leasing Programs. The Committee continues to work to re-duce the cost of federal property and leases. The two resolutions considered for alteration projects address serious health and life safe-ty issues and will consolidate agencies out of leased space into owned space reducing the costs to the taxpayer. The amounts author-ized are consistent with existing funding. In total, these resolutions represent more than $27 million in avoided lease costs. I have enclosed copies of the resolutions adopted by the Committee on Transpor-tation and Infrastructure on April 20, 2016. Sincerely. BILLSHUSTER , Chairman. Enclosures.

FY2016 Project Summary PBS 
Through amended prospectus, the General Services Administration (GSA) proposes design and construction 
tor the rcconfiguration and alteration of space in the Edward J. Schwartz Federal Building-Courthouse (FB-CT) to backfill vacancy resulting 
from the opening of the San Diego Courthouse in 
FY2013. In addition to recapturing vacant space, the project aJiows federal tenants to reduce their overall footprint by consolidating their operations in federal space, relocate childcare operations currently housed in leased space, and correct 
significant life safety and security deficiencies in the 
facility. Approximately 94,000 rentable square feet will be reconfigured, 
allowing the Government to release costly leased space reducing the Government's rental payment to the private sector 
by approximately $2,723,000 annually. 
This prospectus amends Prospectus No. PCA-0167-SD14, to reflect scope changes since the submission 
of the FY20 14 prospectus and to complete work that was not previously approved or 
funded in FY 2014. Of the $61,136,000 requested in FY14, GSA received approval for a portion 
of the proposed project request and apportioned $19,729,000 of funding as part of its FY2014 
Major Repair and Alteration Expenditure

In FY2014, GSA submitted Prospectus Number PCA-0167-SDl4, proposing a $61,136,000 
repair and alteration project to alter vacant space, consolidate multiple agencies, and upgrade 
building systems. ln the absence of full funding for the FY20l4 Capital Investment and Leasing 
Program, GSA's FY2014 Expenditure Plan for Major Repairs and Alterations Program funded the project 
at $19,729,000. The Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works and the House Committee 
on Transportation and Infrastructure approved the reduced scope and funding. This amended prospectus allows 
GSA to accomplish scope that was not funded in FY2014 and to undertake additional scope items including conversion 
of vacant storage space, childcare and consolidate mu1tiple agencies. The project 
will allow GSA to backfill approximately 94,000 rsf vacated by certain District Court Judges and staff, and the Court clerk's operations when they moved 
to the new San Diego Courthouse in 
FY20l3 as well as additional space vacated by the Internal Revenue Service when they relocated to Courthouse. Currently the building does not meet blast and security standards. 
In addition, failure to repair or 
replace the outdated and inefficient building systems will cause operating costs to continue to increase 
and would likely lead to costly system failures. Further deterioration of the building's systems win make it difficult to backfill the space vacated by tenants that relocated to the San 
Diego Courthouse Annex. 
Summary of Energy Compliance 
This project will be designed to conform to requirements of the Facilities Standards for the Public Buildings 
Service and wiH implement strategies to meet the Guiding Principles for High 
Performance and Sustainable Buildings. GSA encourages design opportunities to increase energy and water efficiency above the minimum performance criteria.

The existing leased District Courthouse has experienced water intrusion issues dating 
back to initial occupancy. GSA under the Courthouse Lease is responsible for all 
maintenance and capital improvements, and has made numerous repairs over the term of 
the lease to attempt to resolve these issues. However, the selective repairs have not been 
able to adequately correct the building deficiencies, and water intrusion issues persisted. 
GSA identified significant water intrusion and mold issues in 2014, and, as a result, GSA 
is pursuing a comprehensive solution. Due primarily to the health~related concerns reported by building occupants, and the limited 
ability to move occupants within the 
building during the proposed renovation without disrupting agency missions, GSA

GSA has determined that taking ownership of the courthouse and executing the repair 
and alterations project identified in this prospectus is the most efficient means of housing 
the U.S. District Courts in Pensacola, FL. The 30-year, present value cost of alteration is 
$2,749,195 more than the cost of new construction with an equivalent annual cost disadvantage 
of $147,610, and $44,718,062 less than the cost of a lease with an 
equivalent annual cost advantage of $2,548,623. At this time, the GSA Federal Building Fund 
hns the necessary funds available to support the limited alteration of the District 
Courthouse allowing for rc-occupnncy of the District Courthouse. Utilizing existing Federal Building Fund resources, the 
Alteration alternative also provides a long-term housing solution for building occupants 
more quickly than the New Construction alternative.

The Senate met at 3 p.m. and was called to order by the President pro tempore (Mr. H
ATCH ). 
f 
PRAYER The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-fered the following prayer: Let us pray. Almighty God, the fountain of all goodness, our hearts rejoice with every remembrance of You. Make us eager to do Your bidding and worthy of Your generous mercy. We thank You that You hear and answer our prayers, pro-viding us with the privilege of entering Your throne room whenever we desire. Today, inspire our lawmakers with Your wisdom, infusing them with the steadiness of purpose that glorifies You. Give them power to follow after goodness, striving passionately to please You in their thoughts, words, and deeds. Lord, bless all their under-takings and cause them to prosper. We pray in Your merciful Name. Amen.

PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The President pro tempore led the Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Repub-lic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. E
RNST ). The majority leader is recog-nized. 
f 
MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR—H.R. 1206 AND H.R. 4885 Mr. M
CCONNELL. Madam President, I understand there are two bills at the desk due for a second reading. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will read the bills by title for the second time. The legislative clerk read as follows: A bill (H.R. 1206) to prohibit the hiring of additional Internal Revenue Service employ-ees until the Secretary of the Treasury cer-tifies that no employee of the Internal Rev-enue Service has a seriously delinquent tax debt. A bill (H.R. 4885) to require that user fees collected by the Internal Revenue Service be deposited into the general fund of the Treas-ury. 
Mr. M CCONNELL. In order to place the bills on the calendar under the pro-visions of rule XIV, I object to further proceedings en bloc. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-tion having been heard, the bills will be placed on the calendar en bloc. 
f 
ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOP-MENT APPROPRIATIONS BILL Mr. M
CCONNELL. Madam President, the top Democrat on the Appropria-tions Committee recently said that the energy security and water infrastruc-ture funding legislation before us marks an ‘‘excellent kickoff’’ to the appropriations process. This is the first bill of the ‘‘Appro-priations Committee to come to the floor,’’ she said, and ‘‘it signals that we are ready to do regular order.’’ I share Senator M
IKULSKI ’s sentiment. It has been good to see colleagues working across the aisle expressing an interest and working cooperatively this appro-priations season because we know con-tinued cooperation will be essential to a successful appropriations process. We have seen plenty of positive signs in the Appropriations Committee al-ready. The committee has already ap-proved one-third of the 12 funding bills on a bipartisan basis. With continued cooperation, we will have an oppor-tunity to pass the first of these bills on the floor this week. The energy secu-rity and water infrastructure funding legislation before us is the result of many hours of hard work and research. It will reduce wasteful spending, it will bolster national security, and by ad-vancing priorities like public safety, waterway infrastructure, economic de-velopment, and energy innovation it will impact all 50 of our States. This excellent kickoff to the appro-priations season enjoys bipartisan sup-port. It advanced out of committee by a unanimous vote. It represents yet an-other example of what is possible in a Senate that is back to work. I thank the subcommittee chairman, Senator ALEXANDER , for working with Ranking Member F
EINSTEIN to move this impor-tant bill out of committee. Let’s con-tinue our work today to get one step closer to passage. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic Leader is recognized. 
f 
COMMENDING THE PRESIDING OFFICER Mr. REID. Madam President, I com-mented to my able assistant who is at my desk with me, Bill Dauster—I have always—whenever the Presiding Officer says the Pledge of Allegiance, I am amazed at how she stands at attention. It brings back her old military mind, I am sure. Very impressive. 
f 
FBI INVESTIGATION Mr. REID. Madam President, as each day passes, the senior Senator from Iowa further distinguishes himself as the most political and partisan Judici-ary Committee chairman in history. Last Friday, Senator G
RASSLEY took his political partisanship to a new low when he encouraged the FBI to join the political crusade against Secretary Hil-lary Clinton. The Senator from Iowa is confused about the role of the FBI. By law, the FBI is obligated to do its job and con-duct an independent review for every-thing it has to work on free from polit-ical interference.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES2402 April 25, 2016 
It is wrong for any Senator, espe-cially the chairman of the Judiciary Committee who deals with these issues day after day, to urge the selective leaking of any Federal investigation. The FBI is not in the business of dis-closing information to appease polit-ical operatives, but according to press reports, that is just the sort of thing the Republican Judiciary Committee has done. Remember, there has been a lot of speculation that under Chairman G
RASSLEY ’s leadership the personal in-formation of a Clinton staffer was leaked to the press, including payroll records and a Social Security number, but urging a leak of the FBI investiga-tion for political purposes was not the only thing Senator G
RASSLEY said. The Senator from Iowa was asked what he thought was the worst change in Con-gress during his tenure. He responded that the increasing partisanship was disappointing to him. The audacity and even the hypocrisy of that statement is staggering. Sen-ator G
RASSLEY decries partisanship, while he denies a hearing and a vote to an eminently qualified Supreme Court nominee. For what? No one has a good answer on that. The Senator from Iowa complains of partisanship, even as he uses the Judiciary Committee to wage a political war against Secretary Clin-ton and her staff. Under the guise of oversight, Senator G
RASSLEY has been wasting taxpayer dollars trying to besmirch Hillary Clin-ton’s good name. This has been going on for years. The Senator’s singular focus on Secretary Clinton borders on an obsession. Senator G
RASSLEY has written dozens of letters containing hundreds of requests. He has held hear-ings. He has issued press releases. What have he and his committee achieved? Nothing. All the chairman has done is waste taxpayer dollars. The Judiciary Committee chairman is so desperate to legitimize his at-tacks against Hillary Clinton he is willing to encourage a selective leak of a Federal investigation by, of all peo-ple, the FBI. All this in an effort to award the Presidential nomination to Donald Trump. I agree in one respect with Sen-ator G
RASSLEY . Partisanship in this Chamber is awful. It is paralyzing the Senate and is preventing us from doing our constitutional duties, but much of this is the handiwork of the Judiciary Committee and Senator G
RASSLEY . I ask the Chair to announce the busi-ness of the day.

RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the leadership time is reserved.

MORNING BUSINESS The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will be in a period of morning business until 4 p.m., with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each. Mr. REID. Madam President, I sug-gest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. NELSON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. f 
CHILD POISONINGS FROM LAUNDRY PODS Mr. NELSON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to use articles as examples relevant to the subject of my speech. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. NELSON. Madam President, I rise today to speak about the rapid rise in child poisonings caused by single-use laundry products. Earlier today, we had an update on the number and se-verity of these poisonings from the American Academy of Pediatrics. It was in an indepth study just published in their journal, Pediatrics. The news is not very good, because in 2013 and 2014 that academy reports that there were over 22,000 child exposures to laundry products, resulting in the deaths of at least two children due to the chemicals in these pods, and many others have faced serious injury, with at least 17 children in that time period going into comas because of exposure to these chemicals. What am I talking about? This is a laundry pod. It is very colorful on the outside, and it smells very good. It is quite soft. Its texture, particularly to the touch of an infant—an infant’s hand and face—is very soft and reas-suring. The problem is that if it gets into an infant’s hand, where is it going to end up? It is going to end up in their mouth, and these packages are soluble. So, naturally, the plastic exterior is going to dissolve, and all of these chemicals are going to end up in the child’s digestive system. As a result of these pods, we have had two children die, and we had 22,000 child exposures in that 2-year period the study covers, with 17 children going into comas. Others have suffered seizures or internal burns to their lips, mouths, and the esophagus. If it gets into their esophagus and burns, then you have a problem. Now, what we have been advocating, Senator D
URBIN and I, in our legisla-tion is to make them as safe as possible and to get the Consumer Product Safe-ty Commission involved in these things. This Senator has met with the industry. Let me show you some of the things in which, indeed, they have made progress. This is a detergent pod package, and in order to get in it—and this pod came in this packaging—you have to tear it open. That is one good thing. They have designed this container so that it would be very difficult to get into. Even I am having difficulty getting into it. The pods would be in this con-tainer—something that would be child proof. They designed this container. This has one of those slide bars, such as on a plastic sealant freezer package, where you have to push down on it and apply pressure in order to get the slide that unzips the seal. That is also a good thing. But let me show you what the indus-try is resistant to doing. Children are naturally attracted to colorful candy. Here shown on this chart are a variety of candies, such as gummy bears, but among all of these are interspersed some of these pods. This is one. This is another. This is another, and this is an-other—not unlike the colors on this pod. So if we don’t have the packaging preventing the child from getting to this pod, then we are going to have a problem, which is why we lost two chil-dren and 17 others went into comas in the last 2 years. Now, a lot of people like these prod-ucts, and so does the Nelson family. They serve a very useful purpose. At the same time, we need to make them as safe as possible. So why not just re-move the color from the package and make it less attractive to the child. Last year, Senator DURBIN and I in-troduced legislation that would require better labeling, more child-resistant packaging and safer chemical formula-tions for these single-use laundry pod products. The bill has been referred to our Commerce Committee, and as the ranking member of that committee, I am going to talk again to Senator T
HUNE , who is the chairman of the committee, to see if we can get the committee to take up the bill as soon as possible. Earlier this year, we were able to get both the House and the Senate to pass legislation requiring childproof pack-aging for bottles of liquid nicotine, some of which had injured children and, in some cases, resulted in death as well and had poisoned thousands of others. If we could get that done in a bipartisan manner, which we did and that is now law, then there is no reason why we can’t, in a bipartisan way, ad-dress the issue posed by this problem. Keeping children safe is not a partisan issue. It is just common sense. In the interim, we want to encourage the manufacturers to keep working on new standards to reduce the poisonings. We appreciate very much the efforts at things such as this and this. That is helpful. Last week, one manufacturer announced plans to put many of the laundry pods they sell into new, more child-resistant packaging. They also announced a public edu-cation campaign urging parents to keep laundry pods away from their children. That is certainly helpful. But at the same time, we need to keep working to make these pods less at-tractive to children and, perhaps more

importantly, make the chemicals in-side these less toxic so that when a child does get hold of one and it goes into their mouth, it is not going to turn into tragedy. I thank the American Academy of Pediatrics for their very important study, and I look forward to working with our colleagues to put an end to the accidental deaths and poisonings that we see as a result of these attrac-tive products. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
TRANS-PACIFIC PARTNERSHIP Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, on Sunday, during a joint press conference in Hannover, Germany, with Chan-cellor Angela Merkel, the President of the United States said this: 
And with respect to Congress and the Trans-Pacific Partnership— 
That is the big 5,000-page trade agree-ment the President is trying to move through Congress— 
I think after the primary season is over— 
After the primary season is over— 
the politics settle down a little bit in Con-gress, and we’ll be in a position to start mov-ing forward. Because I know that we had a majority of members in the past who were in favor of this deal. Otherwise we wouldn’t have gotten the authority for me to go ahead and fast track the agreement. But I think we all know that elections can sometimes make things a little more challenging, and people take positions, in part, to protect themselves from attacks during the course of election seasons. 
I would suggest the American people should be very uneasy about their President making such a statement as that. We have already heard that there are plans by a number of forces and in-terest groups to try to slip this TPP through after the election in a lame-duck congressional session. Why would that be the case? Well, the President says it right here: The American people are uneasy about it. They are not for this. Support for it is sinking. Elections are turning on it. And it does not need to become law. I am firmly opposed to this agree-ment. I believe it is bad for our coun-try. It bothers me that if it is such a good deal, why don’t they bring it for-ward? Why don’t we have a debate here while elections are on? Why aren’t peo-ple willing to go home and explain to their constituents how and why they voted the way they did and how and why they believe the way they do? What is wrong with that? Why wait until after, when things settle down a little bit, in the President’s words, when people can’t be held accountable by their constituents for the votes they cast or they think they may be able to slide away afterward? I don’t like this. I don’t think it is the right thing to do. I think it is arro-gant. What the President is fundamen-tally saying and what a lot of these special interest groups are saying is, well, we know you in Congress are so smart, and we know the President is smart. But, the people out here, they don’t understand how smart we all are, and we just need to get this done, and so we will have this trade agreement. But we understand you probably shouldn’t do it right now while elec-tions are going on because, well, you might get your clock cleaned. They might vote you out of office. So we will see if we can’t work up a way to pass it sometime in the future. The President has made it clear that he intends to continue to push through this 5,544-page trade agreement that the American people don’t want. Polls show consistent disapproval of the TPP. A March poll by Americans for Limited Government found that 51 per-cent of Americans did not know any-thing about it. I would say at least 50 percent of the Members of Congress don’t know much about it. It is more than 5,000 pages. I have probably spent more time on it than the vast majority have, and it is rather difficult to read. No wonder the American people say they don’t know a lot about it. But of those who claim to be familiar with it, 58 percent oppose it. There are a lot of reasons for this, and we will talk about it more. Today, U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman announced that they are beginning the 13th round of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership—TTIP, they call it—with the European Union in New York. So this is the second part of the fast- track. The fast-track guarantees a fast vote—without amendments, without the option to filibuster, on the floor of the Senate for less than 2 days, and you get an up-or-down vote. That is what fast-track does. So we will have the Pacific agree-ment probably coming up first, and then we will have the TTIP, the Atlan-tic agreement, and then there is a third one, the Trade in Services Agreement. All of these are huge trade agreements, unlike anything we have seen before, creating in the Pacific an international trade union similar to the beginning of the European Union that Britain is trying to get out of. I think we should be very dubious about that. How is the trade agreement faring in Europe? How about Germany, which is probably one of the leading trading countries in Europe? A poll by the Bertelsmann Foundation, a nonprofit organization that studies domestic and international politics, found that only 17 percent of Germans feel that TTIP— the transatlantic partnership—would be a good deal even though less than 2 years ago it had a 55-percent positive rating. This study found that the more people learn about the agreement, the more they oppose it. The same thing is happening in the United States, in my opinion. The President has referred to the TPP as the ‘‘most progressive trade deal in history.’’ Its chapters create new labor and environmental provi-sions that the public really knows nothing about. Even the economic data the White House promotes as proving the validity of the TPP, if we look at it carefully, we can see that their own report and study that they cite the most—that signing the agreement will decrease the rate of American manufacturing jobs by 120,000. How is this good for America? By their own study, we are going to lose 120,000 manufacturing jobs that we would have maintained had we not signed the agreement. An-other study by Tufts University said the country will lose 400,000 jobs. We are going to go into the differences in the studies, we are going to see the as-sumptions utilized in the model the President cites, and we are going to see that the assumptions they made are not reasonable. They are extreme as-sumptions—assumptions that would never occur in the next 15 years as they assume they will occur. No wonder they can justify positive numbers with those kinds of assumptions. I think all of us have to begin to re-veal—and the American people need to be more alert—how bad this inter-national agreement really is, how it will not positively affect the lives of most Americans. It is just not going to do so. We will look at how the Korean trade deal that I supported in 2011 came no-where close to being beneficial to the United States. In 2011, when President Obama signed the deal, the President said that it would increase American exports by $10 billion to South Korea. I thought that was a good thing. It sounded pretty good, but their esti-mates were way off. The model that experts used to study the Korean trade deal is the same one they are using to study the TPP, and so we have a pretty good test: Did we increase exports by $10 billion each year to South Korea, as the model sug-gested? Well, their imports to us in-creased by $12 billion, and as of last year, we only increased our exports to Korea by less than a couple of hundred million dollars more than in 2011. So we didn’t get any increase at all—vir-tually none. They had a huge increase to us, and our trade deficit with our al-lies and friends in South Korea in-creased 280 percent. This is a serious matter. The same thing happened: They used this same computer model when we signed the agreement with China in 2000. We then had a little less than $70 billion in trade deficit with China. They assumed our exports to China would grow at the same rate as China’s exports to the United States would grow. Did that happen? No. What is the

trade deficit with China today? Push-ing $400 billion. Our trade deficit went up 6 percent again last year. So who is right here: The American people, who are worried about their jobs, their wages, their incomes, or the experts who promised all these grand things if we would just sign these agreements and everybody is going to be better off for it? I think the Amer-ican people are the ones who have been proven right by this data. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator’s time has expired. Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have 1 addi-tional minute. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, the President does not need to be threatening our allies in Britain about the decision of their own people on whether to exit from the European Union. They are not happy with how things are going in the European Union. A lot of people are concerned about it. It is heading toward a close vote. The people of the United King-dom can make their own decision with-out hearing advice or threats from the President of the United States. I don’t blame them for being offended by it. This is certainly not an acceptable po-sition for the President to take. Madam President, I appreciate the opportunity to share these remarks. I want to push back from the President’s recent statements about this trade agreement, how he plans to move it through when people aren’t watching. I also think Congress needs to speak and assert that we affirm the right of the people of the UK to decide whether to remain in the European Union. I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.

F–35 JOINT STRIKE FIGHTER Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise today in support of the F–35 Joint Strike Fighter. I have previously ad-dressed this body on the progress of the F–35 program and its importance to our national defense. On one of those occa-sions, I stated that this weapons sys-tem provides the capabilities we need to protect our freedoms and those of our allies. That statement resonates even more today as the international security landscape grows even more precarious. When the F–35 program started over 20 years ago, the strategic backdrop for the program of record was significantly different than it is today. The Cold War had recently drawn to a close, and the menace of Islamic extremists, rogue states, and nonstate actors was just be-ginning to surface. Today, these groups pose the most salient threat to our na-tional security—and we all know it. To find examples of their deviant behav-ior, look no further than the headlines of today’s papers. In Eastern Europe, Putin’s invasion of a sovereign nation threatens not only the security of the Ukrainian peo-ple but also tests the resolve of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization— perhaps our country’s most important defense alliance. In the Middle East, Iran grows more emboldened with its ballistic missile tests, rattling a region already on the verge of violent conflict. And none of this is to mention the metastasis of ISIS in Iraq and a seemingly endless civil war in Syria. In Asia, the North Korean regime constantly threatens South Korea with war. Meanwhile, tensions over terri-torial waters in the South China Sea grow more strained, escalating the pos-sibility of conflict between China and our Asian allies. All the while, China continues to leverage its economic lar-gesse to build highly advanced weapons systems. I believe many Members of this body would agree that the dangers facing our country today are more immediate and far-reaching than they were just 20 years ago. As threats to our national security proliferate across the globe, we need a next-generation weapon system of un-paralleled capability. We need a strike fighter powerful enough to deter the aggression of our foes. We need an air-craft that can penetrate advanced enemy air defenses and neutralize tar-gets on the ground. In short, we need the F–35. In fact, we need the F–35 today more than ever. Even so, there are those who seek to reduce or delay the number of F–35s being produced. I strongly advise against this action. Reducing procure-ment numbers for the F–35 will only make the aircraft more expensive in the long run. To ensure that our country continues to dominate airpower for decades to come, we must stay the course and re-sist the urge to cut aircraft. That is why I believe we must increase, not de-crease, the number of F–35s scheduled for production. Recently, several of my colleagues, led by Senators C
ORNYN and S HAHEEN , sent a letter to the Armed Services Committee and the Defense Appropria-tions Subcommittee in both the House and the Senate. Their letter was clear: The need for the F–35 in today’s envi-ronment is crucial. Therefore, the com-mittees of jurisdiction should not fol-low the President’s budget reduction plan but should maintain the program of record. I realize the frustrations that many of my colleagues have with the acquisi-tion process of the Department of De-fense. During the first two decades of the F–35’s journey, the Joint Strike Fighter Program Office experienced its fair share of setbacks, broken prom-ises, missteps, and faulty leadership de-cisions—decisions made by both gov-ernment leaders and industry partners. Even from within the Pentagon itself, we have heard the title of ‘‘acquisition malpractice’’ bestowed upon this pro-gram at the highest levels after the Nunn-McCurdy breach for cost growth. Time and again, my much esteemed colleague, the senior Senator from Ari-zona, has pointed out these shortfalls and missteps. I echo his frustrations and stress the need for an acquisition and sustainment strategy that focuses on delivering and sustaining the most available, capable, and affordable weapon systems for the warfighter. Nevertheless, we must recognize that reducing procurement numbers for the F–35 will only put an unnecessary strain on our Armed Forces. Given the dangerous state of global affairs, now is not the time to hamstring our mili-tary’s capabilities. Amid the many criticisms of the F–35 program, I wish to call attention to its successes. In terms of both capability and performance, the F–35 program has made tremendous strides. On the af-fordability front, the price of each F–35 has dropped dramatically over the past 5 years to under $100 million per air-craft. This trend is expected to con-tinue for at least the next 5 years in order to achieve a flyaway cost of $85 million per aircraft by 2019. In an affordability and capability sense, the F–35 is a bargain, but in ad-dition to being a bargain, the F–35 is also an indispensable asset to our de-fense arsenal. The F–35 has the ability to destroy some of the most advanced air-to-air and air-to-ground systems in existence today. Many of these systems are being developed by the Russians and the Chinese. The F–35’s stealth technology, advanced sensors, and weapons allow it to defeat those inte-grated air-defense environments. That is to our advantage, no question about it. Currently, even the most advanced versions of the F–16 and F/A–18 would be hard-pressed to defeat such threats alone. That is why we need the F–35. With the F–35, we can maintain our ability to strike any target anywhere in the world. The F–35 is not only a tremendous strike aircraft, but it is also a war-win-ning dogfighter. In fact, when facing legacy aircraft such as the F–16 and F/ A–18 in air-to-air combat scenarios, the F–35 consistently wins these engage-ments. The aircraft’s combination of stealth, maneuverability, and superior battlespace awareness allows the F–35 to enter the fight against legacy air-craft with a great advantage. If you ask our Marine, Navy, and Air Force pilots flying this aircraft today, they will tell you what they told me: This is the best fighter aircraft they have ever flown and the plane they want to take into battle above all others. This conclusion is shared not just by American pilots who have flown the aircraft, but also by our allies who have chosen to purchase the F–35 out of a wide variety of aircraft that are cur-rently available in other countries as well. As the Israeli Defense Minister re-cently said, ‘‘I’m very happy that we’ll

know how to preserve the qualitative military edge of the Israeli Defense Forces and of the Israeli Air Force through acquisition of this important plane.’’ Military might is useful only if three things occur: One, the capability is present to counter and engage the threat; two, the capacity and numbers are present for all of the threats; and three, those in power have the resolve to use them to protect the sovereignty of our Nation and its citizens. The current demand on our military requires every ounce of capability made available by advanced weapon systems and, just as important, the numbers needed to counter threats the globe over. Consider how in the past we chose to reduce the number of F–22 advanced fighters made available to combatant commanders. Originally, the program of record for the F–22 was 750 aircraft, yet we procured only 195. Today, the demand for the F–22 and its capabili-ties dwarfs the available jets in the in-ventory. In hindsight, we should have bought 1,000. Similar situations have also occurred with the B–2 bomber, the C–17 trans-port, and numerous other aircraft. The lesson is clear: The program of record for 1,763 F–35 A models for the Air Force and 680 B and C models for the Navy and Marine Corps have to mate-rialize and be realized. The committees of jurisdiction should also insist to the Department that the F–35 Joint Pro-gram Office also acquire the spare parts needed to sustain the numbers and accelerate that purchase to ensure that F–35s are sustained at the level of readiness demanded by the current world dynamic. As the old adage goes, if we do not learn from history, then we are doomed to repeat it. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. COATS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

GAO REPORT  
Mr. COATS. Madam President, it is the beginning of the appropriations season here in Washington. I am glad we are doing that. We are a little bit ahead of schedule from past experi-ences, although we haven’t been doing appropriations bills during my second term in the Senate. I am glad we are doing them because that is really what we are here for. For those listening, this is for when Congress determines how we spend tax-payer money. There are a number of people in the gallery today—they are all taxpayers—wondering: Where does this money that is sent to Washington go? When Hoosiers from Indiana send their hard-earned tax dollars to Wash-ington to be spent by the Federal Gov-ernment, they expect their elected leaders to be good stewards of their re-sources. After all, they worked hard to earn this money. Before they get their net paycheck, their taxes are deducted and sent to Washington. They have every right to expect us to be good stewards. It is no wonder taxpayers are furious with Washington when the Federal Government wastes the money they work so hard to make. When they hear about or read about some of the ludi-crous ways we spend their money or the wasteful ways we spend their money, they have every reason to be concerned and to be angry. Clearly, there are essential functions the Federal Government has to under-take, but we can’t continue to ignore the fact that our national debt has now passed $19 trillion. Borrowing money in order to pay for expenditures and then having obligations to pay that money back, along with interest rates, puts us in a very deep hole that we have talked about a lot, but we have not done what is necessary to address this continued plunge into debt. Seemingly every day, we see exam-ples of mismanagement and wasteful spending in Washington, which is one of the reasons I give my weekly ‘‘Waste of the Week’’ addresses. I have come to the floor now more than 40 times in this Congress to talk about docu-mented cases of waste, fraud, and abuse within the Federal Government. It is not something made up but docu-mented abuses by, generally, the Gov-ernment Accountability Office, whose job is to examine how we spend our money and to publicize how that money is spent. Now we have racked up nearly $160 billion of documented waste, fraud, and abuse. This has included the ridiculous, such as Federal grant spending on rab-bit massages, as well as the serious, such as double-dipping in the Social Security Disability Insurance funds. While many Americans struggle every day to pay their mortgage or to put food on the table, it is infuriating that the Federal Government is wast-ing money renting empty warehouses or funding a study to determine if being ‘‘hangry’’ is a real thing. I talked about the word ‘‘hangry’’ in one of my speeches several weeks ago. ‘‘Hangry’’ is a modification of the words hungry and angry. A consider-able amount of taxpayer money was spent on a study to determine if a per-son gets angrier with their spouse when he or she is hungry and so they coined the word ‘‘hangry.’’ It refers to someone who is hungry, and because they are hungry, they get a little anx-ious or a little difficult to live with. This study determined and came to the conclusion that, yes, if you are hungry, you tend to be a little bit angry and you tend to take it out on the person nearest to you, who is usually your spouse. I think any of us could have come up with that conclusion without spending $400,000 or so in order to determine that that is the case. The word ‘‘hangry’’ has now been added to Webster’s dic-tionary. You can look it up. How can we spend $400,000 of the taxpayer’s money to do this study when people are having trouble paying their bills, their mortgage, or saving money so they can send their kids to school? This is the kind of thing that infuriates the Amer-ican people. This is the kind of thing that has put our approval ratings in single digits. This is the kind of thing that causes people to say that Wash-ington needs to be shaken up. Why do we keep taking the American people’s hard-earned tax dollars and spending them on things like this? Many Americans struggle every day to put food on the table and pay their mortgage. It is infuriating to them that the Federal Government is wast-ing money doing these kind of things. Eliminating this wasteful spending can go a long way to restoring trust in Washington, and it needs to start now. That is why, as I said, the studies by the government’s only watchdog agen-cy, the Government Accountability Of-fice, are so important to the work we do here. The GAO, or the Government Ac-countability Office, just released its ‘‘2016 Annual Report’’ on additional op-portunities to reduce fragmentation, overlap, and duplication. The GAO re-port presents 92 new actions we can take—either the Congress or the ad-ministration—to improve government efficiency and effectiveness to achieve cost savings. This report and some of its findings include programs I already talked about, such as the failed ad-vanced technology vehicles program I highlighted last week. Unfortunately, in an amendment I offered here on the floor, we came up short with a vote of 48 to 49, but we raised the awareness of a program that is sitting on nearly $4 billion of unspent money. Of the five proposals that were released—money

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES2406 April 25, 2016 
was released on these five proposals— two of the companies have already gone bankrupt. Instead of sitting on $4 billion worth of additional money that we had to award, we simply said: Look, we have wasted $500 million in this pro-gram. Why don’t we take that $4 bil-lion and use it for a better purpose, like returning it to the taxpayer. If not that, we could have returned that money to the taxpayer or used the money to offset something essential, such as work that prolongs life and brings better health at NIH or perhaps put the money towards something else that is needed, such as infrastructure, but, unfortunately, we came up one vote short of a majority. I am looking forward to exploring ways in which we can use examples in our continued efforts through ‘‘Waste of the Week.’’ We are looking at sev-eral things. We know the IRS is paying billions in fraudulent refunds to crimi-nals who steal people’s IDs over the Internet, or whatever method they use, and then file for IRS returns. We are looking at consolidating programs that are scattered across 22 different Fed-eral agencies and have all kinds of du-plications or selling unused Federal property, which could save billions of dollars a year. The list doesn’t end. It just continues. I will be coming down here week after week. I will have another ‘‘Waste of the Week’’ later this week. Exposing the waste, fraud, and abuse is only the first step that the administration and Congress must take. According to this report, the actions Congress has al-ready taken—and Congress ought to be commended for this—by using GAO’s recommendations over the past 5 years has saved $56 billion. That is not small change. I have documented another $160 bil-lion worth of savings in the last 40 speeches—not million, billion. There is still plenty left to do. In 2010, I asked Hoosiers to send me to Washington to rein in the Federal Government’s runaway spending. Whether it is through my continued ‘‘Waste of the Week’’ speeches, legisla-tion, or highlighting reports like the GAO report, as I am doing today, I will continue to pour every ounce of effort I have into doing as much as I can to reduce wasteful government spending. We will be back later this week with speech No. 41 of ‘‘Waste of the Week.’’ Hopefully, we can continue to alert this Congress and this government to the hard-earned money that is being wasted and could be used for much bet-ter purposes. With that, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I am here to join Senator M
ERKLEY in of-fering amendment No. 3812 regarding funding for wind energy research. This is a straightforward amend-ment. It simply restores funding for wind energy research to the amount provided for just last year—$95.4 mil-lion. The underlying bill provides $80 mil-lion, so the Merkley-Grassley amend-ment will increase funding by just $15.4 million. These additional funds will come from within the Energy Effi-ciency and Renewable Energy Pro-gram, so we can see there is no cost to this amendment from the bottom line of the bill. It does not raise overall spending levels. It simply redirects $15 million from other renewable and effi-ciency programs to wind energy re-search. This funding will allow the Depart-ment of Energy to continue the ad-vancement of wind technologies and in-novations. These advances have greatly increased the competitiveness of wind and facilitated rapid growth in wind energy across the country. In Iowa, wind energy now accounts for more than 30 percent of the State’s total electricity supply. Wind sup-ported 88,000 jobs in 2015, an increase of 20 percent from the previous year. Wind was also the No. 1 source of new generating capacity in 2015—greater than natural gas and solar. Some of my colleagues oppose wind energy and Federal policies that sup-port this clean and renewable energy. They argue we shouldn’t pick winners or that wind is a mature industry. Don’t kid yourself. Wind, while nearly mature, is just an infant compared to the Federal dollars and incentives pro-vided for fossil and nuclear energy. It is quite amusing to me that some of the strongest opponents of wind en-ergy in this body are the biggest pro-ponents of other much more costly pro-grams for mature, traditional energy sources. For example, the 100-year-old oil and gas industry continues to ben-efit from tax preferences that benefit only their industry that result in the loss of more than $4 billion annually in tax revenue. Nuclear energy is another great ex-ample. The first nuclear powerplant came online in the United States in 1958. That was 58 years ago. Nuclear re-ceived special tax treatment, includ-ing—would you believe it—a produc-tion tax credit. Nuclear also benefits from Price-Anderson Federal liability insurance that Congress provided as a temporary measure way back in 1958. This temporary measure—can you be-lieve it—has been renewed through 2025. Nuclear energy has also received more than $74 billion in Federal re-search and development dollars since 1950. This bill includes over $1 billion for nuclear research. This is an in-crease of $71 million, or 7.3 percent, over fiscal year 2016 for wind energy re-search. We are just asking for the same amount of money appropriated for next year as this year. Fossil energy research and develop-ment is another one I can point out, which is allocated $632 million in this bill, equal to the 2016 levels. Even prominent conservative advocacy groups have called for the nuclear and fossil fuel energy funds to be cut or eliminated altogether. Again, this amendment will simply provide level funding for wind energy research by providing an additional $15 million. This is not new money, so there is no score by the CBO. I urge my colleagues to support the Merkley- Grassley amendment. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 minutes on an-other subject as in morning business. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. 
STATE OF OUR POLITICAL DISCOURSE  
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I recently gave a speech to the Midwest Political Science Undergraduate Re-search Conference, which was held at Wartburg College in Waverly, IA. It dealt with the current state of our po-litical discourse and what we should all do as Americans to try and elevate that political discourse. The election-year rhetoric is already heating up in the Senate, so I think it is appropriate to share with the Senate what I told these political science stu-dents and their professors. This is an election year, so there is a lot of talk about how Americans have voted and will vote, as well as which Americans will vote and which ones will not vote. There is something that is evident in this election season, and it is also something I have seen in-crease steadily since I have served in elected office, and that happens to be cynicism. Americans are increasingly cynical about their system of govern-ment and those who serve in that gov-ernment. Candidates of all political stripes are tapping into this cynicism by railing against so-called elites. Sometimes it is the notion of elites within a political party, elites in Wash-ington generally, or elites even in the private sector. Regardless, there is a perception that elites of some kind or another have an undue influence over decisionmaking and ordinary citizens are being ignored. I am not saying that such concerns are all illegitimate, but I think the cynicism is made worse by a lack of understanding when it comes to how our government works and, more im-portantly, why it works the way it does. It seems to me there has been a decline in interest in teaching Amer-ican students about our constitutional system and especially the principles on which it was founded. You cannot un-derstand how our government works and how it is supposed to work without understanding the Constitution. I would add that the best guide to the Constitution is the Federalist Papers. You also cannot understand the Con-stitution without understanding the Declaration of Independence, but you

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2407 April 25, 2016 
cannot understand the Declaration of Independence without understanding the natural rights philosophy. You also cannot separate the study of history from political science. To understand our current political debate, it is important to understand how we got where we are today. For in-stance, the debate between anti-Fed-eralists and Federalists sheds a great deal of light on what our founding gen-eration agreed upon and what they dis-agreed upon. Subsequent events such as the Civil War, the progressive move-ment, and the civil rights movement all drew upon earlier American polit-ical ideas, either borrowing from or re-jecting them. Our political discourse today is inevitably influenced by this heritage, but it also seems discon-nected from it. From cable news shows to the local diner, people with different views shout past each other without compre-hending the opposing arguments. In re-cent years, there has been a realign-ment of political parties that follows more closely along philosophical lines. That has led to more party-line votes, but you would think that would make our debate more about principles in-stead of pure partisanship, but it hasn’t. There has been a lot written about how Americans are increasingly sort-ing themselves into groups—where they live and work with people who think like they do and only consume like-minded media. As a result, when people do encounter a view they don’t agree with, there is a tendency to think there must be something wrong with the person who holds that view. Moreover, if a policy you disagree with gets enacted but almost no one you know supports it, naturally you feel there must be something amiss. That leads to anger, resentment, and cyni-cism, and that makes for fertile ground for demagogues. There are real differences of philos-ophy reflected in the two major polit-ical parties, so I am not arguing there shouldn’t be vigorous debate. In fact, the clash of ideas is an essential part of our representative system of govern-ment, but you cannot effectively chal-lenge an opponent’s philosophy if you don’t understand that philosophy, and you cannot understand your opponent’s philosophy unless you understand what you believe and why you believe it. That is why it is so important Ameri-cans study American history and civics. Thomas Jefferson said: 
If a Nation expects to be ignorant and free in a state of civilization, it expects what never was and never will be. If we are to guard against ignorance and remain free, it is the responsibility of every American to be informed. 
In an election year, we talk a lot about voting being a civic duty, but that is incomplete. Our civic duty goes well beyond the simple act of voting. We have a responsibility to understand what we believe and why before we go into the voting booth. Representative government doesn’t work very well if citizens are only en-gaged in the month or two before an election. Our system of government re-lies on an informed and active citi-zenry. We need more Americans to write their Members of Congress and to ask their positions, attend town meet-ings, and seek to understand both sides of an issue. Still, we have to come to terms with the fact that we are a close-ly divided nation. Better understanding of each other’s principles will elevate the debate, which is good for represent-ative government, but it will not elimi-nate and shouldn’t eliminate political differences. The next step is to respect other peo-ple’s right to live according to their principles. I believe that calls for a re-newed commitment to federalism. The Father of our Constitution, James Madison, designed a system for what he called an extended republic. The clas-sical understanding of a republic as small, unitary, and homogeneous did not apply to the new United States and it certainly doesn’t now. In fact, Madi-son argued that our large, diverse country could better prevent a major-ity faction from forming and trampling on the rights of others. However, it also required decentralizing power and allowing different States and commu-nities to do things their own way. Whenever a government takes an ac-tion, there will almost certainly be some people unhappy with it. That is why the presumption should be to let individual Americans live their lives as they see fit. When government action is warranted, the decision should be made as close as possible to those it af-fects. In my view, the extent to which the Federal Government now makes a great many decisions that affect the lives of Americans beyond the limited role envisioned in the Constitution leads to a great deal of unnecessary conflict. Since our government is so closely divided, a great many decisions will upset almost half of the American peo-ple. That is not a sustainable situation. So my preferred solution—which, of course, is based upon my political phi-losophy—is to let States and commu-nities make more of their own deci-sions when it comes to issues such as health care and education. Of course, others may disagree and do disagree, and we should have that debate, but it should be an honest and respectful de-bate based upon very basic principles. That was the end of my substantive remarks to those students at Wartburg College. I then commended the stu-dents for their interest in exploring po-litical issues. I also said to the stu-dents that the fact that they are inter-ested and that they are engaged and many of their peers are not gives these students a very special calling. I ended my speech with a challenge. I said: I would challenge you to continue developing your understanding of your political beliefs and those of others with whom you may disagree and then do your part to elevate the political dialogue. I would issue the same chal-lenge to my colleagues here in the Sen-ate. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.

I have been very fortunate to serve as his ranking member, and I think that we have put a very good bill together and that his leadership has been very strong. Last week Senator ALEXANDER  brought to the floor a chart, and on that chart there were red and blue lines, and they depicted a lot about the spending patterns of this Nation, which absolutely is relevant, considering we are talking about spending. Well, I wanted to put my rendition before us since no one on the floor is asking to speak at this time. Since 2006 I have asked my staff to put together some charts on spending, which I share every week at my con-stituent breakfast with the constitu-ency from California. I want to tell you a little bit about this chart. The source of this chart is the Congressional Budget Office, and it is the budget and economic outlook part of that. Going back to 2006, we looked at budget numbers, but the ac-tual way to look at it is really outlays. What does the Federal Government spend every year? That is the number which creates the debt and creates in-terest on the debt. In 2006 the Federal Government spent $2.654 trillion in total. Here is how it was spent: This big red part is what are called entitlements. These are manda-tory payments to programs to which an individual is entitled. If you are enti-tled to it, you get it regardless of what impact it has on the budget. They were 53 percent of what the Federal Govern-ment spent in 2006, and interest on the debt was 8 percent. So if we add 53 per-cent and 8 percent, that was about 61 percent of everything that was spent during that year. Nondefense discre-tionary was 19 percent and defense was 20 percent. So the green and the blue were the discretionary programs, the yellow was interest on the debt, and the rest were entitlements. This year the total outlay is $3.919 trillion. Entitlements have gone up to 63 percent of what the Federal Govern-ment will pay out this year. Interest on the debt has dropped 2 percent to 6.5

percent, largely because interest rates are low. Defense discretionary is 15 per-cent, and nondefense discretionary is 15.5 percent. So if we put these two things together, which we are now passing appropriations bills on, they comprise only about 30.5 percent of what the Federal Government will spend this year. The rest is entitle-ments and interest on the debt. If you are entitled to Social Security, you get it. If you are entitled to Medi-care, you get it. If you are entitled to Medicaid; disabled; women, infants, and children; and a whole host of very good programs because they help peo-ple—but they are expensive and they cost. This isn’t often talked about, and I think it is not talked about because individuals don’t want to worry people. But it is a problem, and it is a problem that needs some solutions. If you project these numbers 10 years forward to 2026, we go from total out-lays, total government payments in 2016 of $3.9 trillion, to $6.401 trillion, and entitlements are then 65 percent of what the government will spend in the year 2026. Interest on the debt will dou-ble from what it is today to 13 percent because it is estimated that interest rates will go up. So, adding the two to-gether, you see that we are well over 70 percent in spending. If we look at dis-cretionary spending, defense discre-tionary and nondefense discretionary, we will see they are both 11 percent. That is the economic outlook. So only 22 percent of the budget will be what the Appropriations Committee will be doing in 10 years from now be-cause the rest of it will not be able to be controlled. So we have a constantly escalating picture. In my own view, those things like the Army Corps of Engineers, which in a sense is the only infrastructure pro-gram this country really has outside of the highway program, will be com-pressed more, and everything we spend to make this a better country will be compressed more because of the growth in entitlements and interest on the debt. Well, I believe the time has come for Members on both sides of the aisle to sit down and see what we can do to work out solutions to this ever-grow-ing problem. Is it additional taxes? Are there ways we can change these pro-grams so that they become more effi-cient to cover people and pay for them in a better way than putting them on the debt, which is effectively what we are doing? So I want to state to our distin-guished chairman, who is now here, last week we had his red and blue lines, so this week I brought my charts that I have been using since 2006, and I be-lieve the numbers are correct, and I be-lieve they are also astonishing and they need our concern. I would like to work with the chair-man in the future, and perhaps we could bring together Republicans and Democrats to sit down and consider some remedies that will not be pun-ishing for people but will bring this huge red mark and thereby the interest mark into better control than today. I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Tennessee. Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I congratulate the Senator from Cali-fornia. With her usual precision, she has identified the big problem, and she approached it as she usually does—in a very direct way. The picture she pre-sents is not one we can tolerate in the United States of America. The good news is, we have done a good job on dis-cretionary spending. That is what we are working on in these bills. The chart I showed last week, which shows about the same things in a little different way than hers, points out that the spending in 12 appropriations bills has been flat and will be flat for the next 10 years. In other words, if the work the Appropriations Committee is doing on $1 trillion were all that there was to the Federal budget, we would not have a Federal debt problem. That blue line is Federal spending under control. We set priorities. We have oversight. Senator F
EINSTEIN and I have eliminated programs. We do that every year. We are getting control of this budget of big cost overruns that persistently happened on large con-struction projects. So I am proud of that blue line. I am not proud of the red one. That is the one Senator F
EIN-
STEIN is talking about. This is $1 tril-lion, but on top of that is $3 trillion. That is the automatic spending. There has been very little courage shown on the Republican side of the aisle or on the Democratic side of the aisle. We make big speeches sometimes about the blue line, which isn’t a prob-lem, but very few speeches about the red line that are as straightforward as Senator F
EINSTEIN ’s remarks today. We have a responsibility to tax-payers, to ourselves, and to the next generation to deal with this line be-cause that is the line which is causing the Joint Chiefs of Staff to say that our Federal debt is our biggest na-tional security problem, which is quite a thing to say in a world as unsafe as we have today. I thank the Senator from California. Her prestige in the Chamber makes her remarks today even more important. I look forward to working with her to gradually bring this red line under con-trol while we still can. I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. C

AMENDMENT NO . 3813 TO AMENDMENT NO . 3801 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator M
URRAY , I call up Murray amendment No. 3813 and ask unanimous consent that it be reported by number. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report the amendment by number. The legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from California [Mrs. F EIN-
STEIN ], for Mrs. M URRAY , proposes an amend-ment numbered 3813 to amendment No. 3801. 
The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To add a provision relating to cer-tain requirements in the acquisition of welded shipboard anchor and mooring chain) At the end of title I, add the following: S
EC. 1ll. None of the funds made avail-able by this title may be used for any acqui-sition that is not consistent with section 225.7007 of title 48, Code of Federal Regula-tions. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, is it appropriate for me to speak on the Murray amendment? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator is recognized. Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I say to the body that I support this amendment. The Murray amendment would reinforce ‘‘Buy American’’ provi-sions that have been in place for dec-ades. These provisions say that when American tax dollars are being spent, the preference should be to buy Amer-ican products. Despite current Federal regulations, there are concerns that the Corps of Engineers is circumventing these ‘‘Buy American’’ provisions and acquiring welded shipboard anchor and mooring chain manufactured by foreign sources. The Murray amendment simply reiter-ates current requirements to support American-made products, echoing lan-guage from our colleagues in the House and the 2016 appropriations bill. The amendment is good for families and workers across the country, and I urge this body to support it. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Tennessee. Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, Murray amendment No. 3813 simply re-states an existing regulation, so I have no objection to it. I am going to vote for it. I yield back all time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been yielded back. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 3813. Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient sec-ond. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. CORNYN. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator from Texas (Mr. C

Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I know of no further debate on these amendments. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendments en bloc. The amendments (Nos. 3841; 3842; 3851; 3843; 3844; 3808; 3869, as modified; and 3870) were agreed to. Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader, Senator M
CCONNELL , the Democratic leader, Senator R
EID, and my colleague, Sen-ator F
EINSTEIN . What we have done is approved eight more amendments by Senators with a voice vote, and we have already agreed to have three more votes at 11 a.m. to-morrow. We are making good progress. We hope to continue to do that and wrap up the bill soon. Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I wish to support two crucial programs important to Utah and the West in the Energy and Water Appropriations bill pending before us. The bill includes $10 million for the Central Utah Project in the Depart-ment of the Interior. This funding makes great strides in supporting rural water infrastructure. Over the decades- long life of this project, I have always advocated for appropriate funding lev-els to ensure timely completion of this project. This vital program was authorized in the 1956 Colorado River Storage Project Act and allows the State of Utah to develop its share of the Colo-rado River for irrigation and water supply. This program also reaches into five other States and provides for con-struction of water delivery infrastruc-ture. Over the past few years, the Obama administration has constantly tried to underfund the Central Utah Project, but Senator A
LEXANDER and Senator F
EINSTEIN have been able to restore funding to levels that enable construc-tion to move forward. Continuing funding for this project is important to taxpayers. Once the project is built and begins to deliver water, the people of Utah will start to repay their share of the costs to the Treasury. This funding also allows mitigation work to continue, which restores and protects lands that are important to fish and wildlife that have been im-pacted by Federal water development for this project. While we all wish additional funding were available for the important projects in our State, I believe that Senator A
LEXANDER and Senator F EIN-
STEIN have done a good job in balancing priorities, and I appreciate them in-cluding funding to continue this vital program. Another important program funded in this bill is the section 595 environ-mental infrastructure program in the Corps of Engineers. Section 595 is a program that pro-vides funding to rural areas in Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming for water construction projects. The bill includes $10 million for this program, which the Corps of Engineers will allocate competitively among the eligible States. Section 595 funding is particularly important for projects in rural areas surrounded by Federal lands. Often, local sponsors can’t meet the general 50/50 cost share required for construc-tion projects, but section 595 reduces the non-Federal cost-share. An example of where this program made a big difference in my State is in the small town of Escalante, where sec-tion 595 funds were used to rehabilitate and enlarge the Wide Hollow Reservoir. Before the project began, irrigation water that was held in the reservoir only lasted until mid-July, leaving most farmers with wilted crops during the heat of the summer. The Corps of Engineers provided $5.5 million under the section 595 program, which was matched with nearly $8 mil-lion in State grants and loans. Today, because of Section 595, Escalante farmers can expect to re-ceive water throughout the growing season, which allows them to harvest hay and other critical crops that, in the past, they would have had to pur-chase. There are projects just like Wide Hol-low Reservoir throughout the State of Utah—in fact, all throughout the West—and taxpayers can be assured that the $10 million provided in the En-ergy and Water bill will be put to good use. I appreciate Senator ALEXANDER and Senator F
EINSTEIN working with me to include these critical funds, especially given the tight budgets that we face this year and the competing priorities they had to consider. To conclude, Mr. President, I believe that the Energy and Water bill that Senator A
LEXANDER and Senator F EIN-
STEIN have before the Senate is a bal-anced, prioritized bill that includes im-portant priorities not only for my State of Utah, but also for the Nation and I urge its passage. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Nebraska. 
HONORING NEBRASKA ’S SOLDIERS WHO LOST  
THEIR LIVES IN COMBAT  
Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I rise today to continue my tribute to Ne-braska’s heroes and the current genera-tion of men and women who lost their lives defending our freedom in Iraq and Afghanistan. Each of these Nebraskans has a spe-cial story to tell. Throughout this year and beyond, I will continue to honor their memory here on the Senate floor. 
MASTER SERGEANT LINDA TARANGO -GRIESS  
Mr. President, today, I wish to high-light the life of MSG Linda Tarango- Griess of Sutton, NE. Linda was known to everyone as one proud soldier. From an early age, she was disciplined and focused on the fu-ture. Her Aunt Marie remembers this future soldier as ‘‘a great kid’’ who was always helping others. Marie would know because she raised Linda from the age of 11. Linda attended Kearney High School, where she enjoyed playing softball and volleyball. She was also active in the Big Brothers Big Sisters program. Linda’s willingness to serve as a role model and mentor for others came as no surprise to those who knew her. As one of her high school classmates re-called, Linda was ‘‘someone who al-ways had a smile and a positive atti-tude.’’ After graduating from Kearney High School in 1989, Linda was determined to go to college, but she struggled to find a way to pay for it. She learned about tuition assistance opportunities offered by the National Guard and she decided to enlist. Through the National Guard, Linda discovered her passion for being a sol-dier in the U.S. military. It also al-lowed her to complete her college edu-cation. Linda graduated from the University of Nebraska in Kearney with a degree in criminal justice. As part of her service, Linda was re-quired to train one weekend a month in York, NE. It was there that Linda met her soulmate, Doug Griess. After dat-ing for a few years, they were married in 1994. For the next several years, the young couple formed a new bond and they began planning for the future while continuing their service in the Na-tional Guard. Less than a decade after they were married, their roles in the military would bring them both to the frontlines of a new war a world away from home in Iraq. Linda and Doug wondered which of them would be called up first. Then the news came for Linda to deploy with the 267th Ord-nance Company. After deployment training, the 267th arrived at Camp Speicher near Tikrit, Iraq, in February of 2004. As one of the unit’s senior sergeants, Linda’s helpful nature and her insistence on doing every job well quickly stood out. Her professionalism and caring nature boosted the morale of her platoon. An officer from a nearby unit said Linda ‘‘was always a true profes-sional—not only a mentor but also a friend. She served her country honor-ably.’’ The summer of 2004 was shaping up to be a complicated period. Doug was at annual training back home, and ru-mors were flying about his unit deploy-ing. At the same time, Linda was plan-ning to return home on leave to be with Doug and her family for a short time. On July 10, Doug’s unit received de-ployment orders. The following day, on July 11, 2004, the unthinkable hap-pened. Linda was driving in a convoy through a high-threat area in Samarra, Iraq. The convoy was attacked by Al Qaeda insurgents, and Linda’s vehicle

took a direct hit from an improvised explosive device. Linda and another soldier were killed. She was only 2 weeks from returning to Nebraska. Doug was at home with his friends discussing their upcoming deployment. Suddenly, a car pulled up with three soldiers dressed in Class A uniforms, and Doug knew why they were there. Linda was buried in Sutton, NE, and over 1,000 mourners traveled to this small town in Central Nebraska to honor this brave soldier. A month later, Doug deployed to Iraq with his unit. His grief over the loss of Linda was held at bay for a year as he focused on his mission and his fellow soldiers. Linda would have wanted it that way. Doug’s commitment to fulfilling his oath and serving his Nation would have made her proud. MSG Linda Tarango-Griess was the first woman to lose her life in combat while serving in the Nebraska National Guard. She earned the Purple Heart, the Bronze Star, and was promoted posthumously to Master Sergeant. Doug would later remarry, and he is now the proud father of three wonder-ful children. Linda’s Aunt Marie lives in Lincoln, where she is active in Yel-low Ribbon activities for troops serving abroad. Linda’s sister Vicki lives in North Platte with her three children, not far from her brother Augie and her father Augustin. To this day, one of Linda’s cousins keeps an email from Linda that was sent before she departed on her final mission. In the email, Linda proudly describes how her platoon competed in a 5-mile run which the 267th nick-named the ‘‘Desert Dash.’’ Linda said: ‘‘None of us won the race, but in our hearts we are winners, our reward is the self-satisfaction for just finishing the race.’’ I hope all Nebraskans remember her as an example of what it means to serve our Nation with bravery, compas-sion, and joy. MSG Linda Tarango-Griess is a hero. She embodied the grit and determina-tion of an American soldier, and I am honored to tell her story. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. 
NOMINATION OF JESSICA ROSENWORCEL  
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, we have a great opportunity in the Senate to recognize and reconfirm an extraordinarily distinguished and dedi-cated public servant who happens to be from West Hartford, CT, Jessica Rosenworcel of the Federal Commu-nications Commission. I understand there was an agreement as part of the approval of Commis-sioner O’Rielly and that Michael O’Rielly, in fact, was reconfirmed as part of a very unusual request that there be that agreement. The President renominated Ms. Rosenworcel for a new 5-year term in 2015, and she was easily and unanimously confirmed by the Commerce Committee. I think we ought to keep that agreement in the Senate, that anyone a party to that agreement when the Democratic lead-er, Senator REID, agreed to reconfirm Republican FCC Commissioner Michael O’Rielly—that we ought to move for-ward. But apart from the politics and the internal agreements that may have been reached—and they deserve to be honored—Commissioner Rosenworcel is supremely well qualified, and she is needed on the Commission, which is sorely in need of her expertise and ex-perience in specific areas. Let me give just a few examples. No. 1, as an example of her leadership, she led the effort to provide for writing rules that will enable enforcement of the 9/11 locating standards for all 9/11 services across the country. The GPS location services require those rules. She has written standards and will en-able those standards to become the guiding light for all 9/11 services. That is important in cases of emergency. It is important in cases of physical and emotional trauma or crashes—an acci-dent. It is important in cases of opioid or heroin overdoses, which are becom-ing increasingly prevalent across the country. In fact, in Connecticut and, my guess, Oklahoma and all across the country, there is an epidemic of opioid and heroin addiction tragically taking a toll in deaths and financial costs. When there are overdoses, the adminis-tration of Narcan or naloxone within a limited period of time may be the dif-ference between life and death and, in fact, can bring people back from the brink of death. Those types of location standards will help emergency responders go to the places they are needed. The stand-ards applied to the 9/11 services that enable the first responders to go to those places are a result of the work that Commissioner Rosenworcel has done on the FCC. That is only one ex-ample of the kind of work she has done. She has been outspoken on the cruel struggle faced by students left out of the broadband revolution, as countless are in areas that have no Internet ac-cess at home and face obstacles, lit-erally, to complete homework they are given at school and to apply for schol-arships they need financially. Today, roughly 7 in 10 teachers assign home-work that requires access to broadband, but the data from the FCC suggests that almost 1 in 3 households lacks subscriptions to broadband serv-ices. They simply do not subscribe to those services at any speed with any server due to lack of affordability and, frankly, lack of interest. Ms. Rosenworcel has made this ‘‘homework gap’’—a term, by the way, that she coined—one of her top prior-ities and has pushed all of us to think creatively to provide all students with the connectivity they need for a fair chance to succeed. That is really the American dream—a fair chance to suc-ceed, closing the gap that results from this lack of access to the Internet, which in turn creates a homework gap and a scholarship gap and generally de-prives those students of a fair chance. As Commissioner, Ms. Rosenworcel has visited schools across the country in Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, and many more and witnessed how the Internet can support greater learning opportunities and also how limited broadband capacity prevents students from developing the skills essential for them to compete in the global, digital economy. Drawing from these experi-ences and her experience in the Senate working on this program, she called for an E-Rate 2.0 to ensure that the E-Rate Program is reinvigorated to meet the future connectivity needs for libraries and schools through stronger broadband capacity standards and ro-bust funding. That robust funding is an investment this Nation needs to make. She is continuing the legacy of Sen-ator Rockefeller to fight for strong public safety, not only on the FCC 9/11 rules, which keep communities safe and provide emergency responders the ability they need to go to places where there are overdoses or other health emergencies, but she has also worked on a bipartisan policy, a spectrum pol-icy leading the FCC to raise record-breaking amounts in the last year’s wireless spectrum auction and ensuring that there is more than enough to fully fund FirstNet, the nationwide inter-operability network for public safety officials to communicate during emer-gencies. She has taken her own time—and she has a young family—on multiple occa-sions when she is back home in Con-necticut to join me in helping to edu-cate wireless customers and consumers on what they can do to avoid cram-ming—those are the charges on phone bills that consumers never consent to and never know about in many in-stances—and where they can go to seek refunds when they are victims of these kinds of cramming scams. She has been a champion of consumer interest on cramming refunds, on preventing cram-ming, and on helping to reach wise and prudent settlements with the carriers. She has joined me to call on tele-phone companies to offer consumers new tools to block robocalls. What I find—and it is a relevant point during the campaign season in which we find ourselves—is that voters, consumers, residents, people from all walks of life in both parties, and a lot with no party at all, deeply resent the robocalling we see so often. Those robocalls come from commercial interests and some-times from political interests. I ap-prove banning robocalls. Whether or not we agree to ban them, consumers ought to have the ability to block them if they choose to. That is the cause she has championed with me.

I deeply respect her commitment to consumer interests. She is widely ac-knowledged for her keen judgment and insight on all these issues, advancing smart telecommunications policy for the public benefit. She is a graduate of Wesleyan Uni-versity and New York University Law School. Her career has been about tele-communications law, which included time as senior communications counsel for the Senate Commerce Committee under the leadership of both Senator Rockefeller and Senator Inouye. In her time on the Commission, she has been a champion of consumers, stu-dents, emergency responders, of every-day working men and women who de-serve the best system and protection of their interests when it comes to tele-communications. There was an agreement that ought to be respected, but as important or even more important than an agree-ment, she deserves and the country needs for her to serve as a Commis-sioner. I urge my colleagues to reconfirm her swiftly and overwhelmingly so that she can continue to do this vital and im-portant work she has been doing. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

EARTH DAY Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last Fri-day marked the 46th annual Earth Day, and we cannot ignore that we are at a crossroads in time. Human-caused cli-mate change is accelerating with each passing year and is now taking a severe toll on our planet. We see it in our scorched farmlands and burnt forests in the West and in the flood ravaged river valleys and superstorm battered coastlines in the East. Climate change is not a hoax, and we must act now to protect our future and our future gen-erations. Earth Day is an opportunity to rec-ognize that climate change is not only the greatest threat to our environment today, but it also poses a threat to pub-lic health and to our national and eco-nomic security. In coming years, the economy of Vermont, the United States, and every country on Earth will be altered. We must guide that economic transformation to protect fu-ture generations. We are really just beginning to grap-ple with the serious economic con-sequences of climate change across the country. In Vermont, we saw the warmest winter on record this year, with mean temperatures 5 to 10 degrees above normal and snowfall several feet below normal. On Christmas Eve, the mercury hit 68 degrees in the State capital of Montpelier, beating the pre-vious record by 17 degrees. The abnor-mally high temperatures and lack of snow hurt our ski and tourism indus-tries. Many ski areas saw business down 20 percent, and some saw a drop of as much as 40 percent. This does not just impact the ski areas and the mountains, but also our restaurants, local hotels, contractors, and other businesses that are driven by the ski industry. Climate change could also impact Vermont’s maple industry, which con-tributes more than $300 million in sales to Vermont’s economy every year. While 2016 has been a successful year for producing maple syrup, if tempera-tures continue to rise each year, in the short term we could face reduced sap quality and even a decrease in the amount of sap produced. I am also very concerned that, in the long term, our sugar maple stands could be decimated by invasive pests or threatened by drought and forest fires. The agri-culture and fisheries sector is highly dependent on specific climate condi-tions, and maple production will not be the only agricultural industry affected. The Pacific Northwest’s winemakers, Alaska’s salmon fisheries, the Southeast’s peanut producers, and corn growers in the Midwest could all face significant climate-related challenges. The threats posed by climate change are numerous and can be downright frightening. However, Earth Day—and every day—we must remember that, if we can have such a profound negative impact on our environment, we can also have a profound positive affect on the drivers of climate change. If we make climate the top priority around which we organize and refocus eco-nomic decisions, we can find solutions to climate risk through creative think-ing and innovation. While climate change does represent one of the great-est challenges of our time, we should see it as opportunity to nurture and at-tract entrepreneurism, rather than dragging our heels or denying that there is a problem. I am proud that time after time Vermonters continue to come together to identify solutions to big problems. I am amazed and energized every day by Vermont innovators who are thinking creatively and already leading nation-ally and internationally. Vermont businesses, nonprofits, and educational institutions are already tackling big problems and finding solutions to cli-mate change, solutions that are being readied to be deployed in Vermont and exported around the world. Just last week, I had joined leaders from the University of Vermont to announce a National Science Foundation competi-tive award of $20 million to Vermont EPSCoR, which will support research of the Lake Champlain Basin and its watersheds to find out what has made some parts of the basin resilient in the face of extreme weather events, while

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2413 April 25, 2016 
other parts fail to recover and rebound. Work like this on Lake Champlain will give Vermont and other regions new tools to help build resiliency in areas that have been vulnerable in the past. Recently, I was pleased to hear that not just one, but two Vermont compa-nies, Green Mountain Power and Vermont Electric Power Company, or VELCO, are finalists for the Edison Electric Institute’s prestigious Edison Award this year for their innovation and contribution to the advancement of the electric industry. Green Moun-tain Power is working to expand re-newable energy production in Vermont and is taking their Cow Power model to the next level with a large multifarm bio-digester. Meanwhile, VELCO’s Vermont Weather Analytics Center will help to build a more reli-able grid as customers, communities, and energy businesses work to prepare for the more severe storms brought by climate change and will also help gar-ner renewable energy’s full value and potential in the State. These are cut-ting-edge projects, generating jobs and knowledge while generating energy. Some people see climate change sim-ply as an environmental issue, but it is about so much more than that. Cre-ating a green energy sector is not just about cutting greenhouse gas emis-sions. It is about providing jobs for Americans in the renewable energy and energy efficiency sectors. This is about strengthening national security through energy independence. This is about breaking the stranglehold of oil on the transportation system by devel-oping alternative transportation en-ergy sources. Addressing climate change is also about ensuring that our children and grandchildren have clean air to breathe on Earth Day and every day for generations to come. We have come together before, across the aisle and across regions, to solve large problems. We must do so again. We owe it to the planet and to future generations.

ARMS SALES NOTIFICATION Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control Act requires that Congress receive prior no-tification of certain proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification, Congress has 30 cal-endar days during which the sale may be reviewed. The provision stipulates that in the Senate the notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the Senate Foreign Rela-tions Committee. In keeping with the committee’s in-tention to see that relevant informa-tion is available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the R
ECORD the notifications which have been received. If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such annex is available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign Relations Committee, room SD–423. There being no objection, the mate-rial was ordered to be printed in the RECORD , as follows:

EAR MR. CHAIRMAN : Pursuant to the re-porting requirements of Section 36(b)(5)(A) of the Arms Export Control Act (AECA), as amended, we are forwarding Transmittal No. 0K–16. This notification relates to enhance-ments or upgrades from the level of sensi-tivity of technology or capability described in the Section 36(b)(1) AECA certification 14– 44 of 17 September 2014. Sincerely, J.W. R
IXEY, Vice Admiral, USN, Director. Enclosures. 
TRANSMITTAL NO . 0K–16 Report of Enhancement or Upgrade of Sensi-tivity of Technology or Capability (Sec. 36(b)(5A), AECA) (i) Purchaser: Poland. (ii) Sec. 36(b)(1), AECA Transmittal No.: 14–44; Date: 17 September 2014; Military De-partment: Air Force. (iii) Description: On 17 September 2014, Congress was notified by Congressional cer-tification transmittal number 14–44 of the possible sale under Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act of 40 AGM–158A Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles (JASSM), 2 AGM–58A JASSM Live with Test Instrumentation Kit (TIK) and Flight Termi-nation Systems (FTS), 2 AGM–158A JASSM Inert with TIK and FTS, and 2 Flight Certifi-cation Test Vehicles. Also included: Oper-ational Flight Plan upgrade to M6.5 tape for the Polish F–16C/D Block 52 aircraft to in-clude JASSM integration, missile con-tainers, spare and repair parts, support and test equipment, publications and technical documentation, personnel training and training equipment, U.S. Government and contractor engineering, technical, and logis-tics support services, and other related ele-ments of logistical and program support. The estimated total cost was $500 million. Major Defense Equipment (MDE) constituted $270 million of this total. This transmittal reports the addition of twenty-eight (28) AGM–158A Joint Air-to Surface Standoff Missiles (JASSM) to the previously notified sale. Upon completion of contract negotiations between the U.S. Gov-ernment and the vendor, the per-missile price was significantly lower than antici-pated, resulting in residual funds available to Poland. Poland decided to use these funds to procure twenty-eight (28) additional mis-siles. Increasing the quantity of missiles will not result in a net increase in the value of MDE originally notified. The total case value will remain $500 million. (iv) Significance: The proposed increase in quantity will improve Poland’s capacity to deter regional threats and to strengthen its homeland defense as well as to strengthen its air-to-ground strike capabilities. (v) Justification: The proposed sale will contribute to the foreign policy and the na-tional security objectives of the United States by helping to improve the security of a NATO ally. Poland continues to be an im-portant force for political stability and eco-nomic progress in Central Europe. (vi) Date Report Delivered to Congress: April 21, 2016. DEFENSE SECURITY  C

Aus-tralia will have no difficulty absorbing these missiles into its armed forces. The proposed sale of this equipment will not alter the basic military balance in the region. The principal contractor for production is Raytheon in Tucson, Arizona. The principal contractor for integration is unknown and will be determined during contract negotia-tions. There are no known offset agreements proposed in connection with this potential sale. Implementation of this sale will not re-quire the assignment of any additional U.S. or contractor representatives to Australia. There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-fense readiness as a result of this proposed sale. 
TRANSMITTAL NO . 16–19 Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act Annex Item No. vii (vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 1. The AIM–120D AMRAAM hardware, in-cluding the missile guidance section, is clas-sified CONFIDENTIAL. State-of-the-art technology is used in the missile to provide it with unique beyond-visual-range capa-bility. The increase in capability from the AIM–120C–7 to AIM–120D consists of a two- way data link, a more accurate navigation unit, improved High-Angle Off-Boresight (HOBS) capability, and enhanced aircraft to missile position handoff. 2. AIM–120D features a target detection de-vice with embedded electronic counter-measures, an electronics unit within the guidance section that performs all radar sig-nal processing, mid-course and terminal guidance, flight control, target detection, and warhead burst point determination. 3. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the infor-mation could be used to develop counter-measures that might reduce weapon system effectiveness or be used in the development of a system with similar or advanced capa-bilities. 4. A determination has been made that the recipient country can provide substantially the same degree of protection for the sen-sitive technology being released as the U.S. Government. This sale is necessary in fur-therance of the U.S. foreign policy and na-tional security objectives outlined in the Policy Justification. 5.

TRANSMITTAL NO . 0E–16 Report of Enhancement or Upgrade of Sensi-tivity of Technology or Capability (Sec. 36(b)(5)(A), AECA) (i) Purchaser: Government of Tunisia. (ii) Sec. 36(b)(l), AECA Transmittal No.: 14– 23; Date: 23 July 2014; Military Department: Army. (iii) Description: On 23 July 2014, Congress was notified by Congressional Notification Transmittal Number 14–23, of the possible sale under Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Ex-port Control Act of twelve UH–60M Black Hawk aircraft as well as spare and repair parts, weapon systems, configurations up-dates, communications security equipment and radios, integration studies, support equipment, aircraft ferry and tanker sup-port, repair and return, publications and technical documentation, personnel training and training equipment, U.S. Government and contractor engineering and logistics per-sonnel services, and other related elements of logistics support. The estimated total cost was $700 million. Major Defense Equipment (MDE) constituted $440 million of this total. This transmittal reports the inclusion of eighteen (18) sets of Embedded Global Posi-tioning System/Inertial Navigation System (GPS/INS) equipment as MDE. Although the value of the GPS/INS was included in the total value of the case, it was not enumer-ated or valued as MDE in the original notifi-cation. Upgrading the status of this equip-ment to MDE will increase the MDE cost by $7.5 million. Additionally, this transmittal reports the inclusion of two (2) M36–E9 Captive Air Training Missiles (CATM) in the weapons configuration (Hellfire training missiles) as MDE. Although the value of the CATM was included in the total value of the case, it was not enumerated or valued as MDE in the original notification. Upgrading the status of this equipment to MDE will increase the MDE cost by $105,000. Finally, this transmittal report designates the Advanced Precision Kill Weapons Sys-tem (APKWS) as the specific Precision Guid-ed Rocket System listed in the original noti-fication. It has now been determined that the APKWS will be the Precision Guided Rocket System integrated into the aircraft and will include 515 all up rounds. The APKWS all-up rounds consist of guidance sections, MK66 MOD 4 2.75 inch rocket mo-tors, and M152 High Explosive (HE) war-heads. The value of the APKWS was included in the total case value of the original notifi-cation but was not included in the MDE cost. The inclusion of the APKWS as MDE will in-crease the MDE cost by $17.5 million. The re-vised total MDE cost is $465.1 million. The total case value will remain $700 million. (iv) Significance: The GPS/INS provides highly accurate all-altitude, all-weather navigation and timing information to the UH–60M Black Hawk aircraft, allowing more precise flight pattern and rendezvous. The CATM consists of a functional guidance sec-tion coupled to an inert missile bus and is used for flight training but cannot be launched. The inclusion of APKWS rounds will improve Tunisia’s capacity to sustain security operations and strengthen its inter-nal and external defense capabilities and in-crease its ability to carry out operations against terrorist forces while significantly reducing risk to civilians. (v) Justification: The United States is committed to the security of Tunisia, and it is vital to U.S. national interests to assist Tunisia to develop and maintain a strong and ready self-defense capability. This up-grade to a previously approved sale will fur-ther enhance Tunisia’s interoperability with the U.S. Army. (vi) Date Report Delivered to Congress: April 21, 2016. 
TRANSMITTAL NO . 0E–16 Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act Annex Item No. vii (vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 1. The CATM consists of a functional guid-ance section coupled to an inert missile bus and is used for flight training but cannot be launched. The missile has an operational semi-active laser seeker that can search for and lock-on to laser-designated targets. It functions like a tactical missile (without launch capability) during captive carry on the aircraft, making it suitable for training the aircrew in simulated Hellfire missile tar-get acquisition and lock. The Sensitive Technology is contained within the oper-ational semi-active laser seeker. The highest level for release of the M36–E9 CATM is SE-CRET, based upon the semi-active seeker. Reverse engineering could reveal CON-FIDENTIAL information. Vulnerability data, countermeasures, vulnerability/suscep-tibility analyses, and threat definitions are classified SECRET or CONFIDENTIAL. 2. The APKWS II All-Up-Round (AUR) is an air-to-ground weapon that consists of an APKWS II Guidance Section (GS), legacy 2.75-inch MK66 Mod 4 rocket motor and leg-acy MK152 and MK435/436 warhead/fuze. The APKWS is a tactical rocket system that can be launched from several platforms, offering multi-mission, multi-target capability and precision-strike lethality. These guided rockets are steered to the target by fol-lowing reflected laser beam energy directed onto the target either by the launching air-craft, a second aircraft, or ground-based troops operating a laser designator. Hard-ware is Unclassified; information related to performance, effectiveness, vulnerabilities and counter-measure is classified up to SE-CRET. 3. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the infor-mation could be used to develop counter-measures that might reduce system effec-tiveness or be used in the development of a system with similar or advanced capabili-ties. 4. A determination has been made that the recipient country can provide the same de-gree of protection for the sensitive tech-nology being released as the U.S. Govern-ment. This sale is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and national secu-rity objectives outlined in the Policy Jus-tification. 5. All defense articles and services listed in this transmittal have been authorized for re-lease and export to the Government of Tuni-sia.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION  Qatar—RIM–116C and RIM–116C–2 Rolling Airframe Missiles The Government of Qatar has requested a possible sale of two-hundred and fifty-two (252) RIM–116C Rolling Airframe Tactical Missiles, and two (2) RIM 116C–2 Rolling Air-frame Telemetry Missiles. Also included are support equipment, publications and tech-nical documentation, personnel training, U.S. Government and contractor engineer-ing, technical and logistics support services, live fire test event support, and other related integration elements. The total estimated value of MDE is $227 million. The overall total estimated value is $260 million. This proposed sale contributes to the for-eign policy and national security of the United States by helping to improve the se-curity of a friendly country. Qatar is an im-portant force for political stability and eco-nomic progress in the Persian Gulf region. This proposed sale will provide Qatar with military capabilities to protect its naval forces and nearby oil/gas infrastructure from air and missile threats. Qatar will have no difficulty absorbing these missiles into its armed forces. The proposed sale of this equipment, serv-ices, and support will not alter the basic military balance in the region. The principal contractor will be Raytheon Missile Systems in Tucson, Arizona. There are no known offset agreements proposed in connection with this potential sale. Implementation of this proposed sale will require multiple trips by U.S. Government and contractor representatives to participate in program and technical reviews, system in-tegration, as well as training and mainte-nance support in country for a period of thir-ty-six (36) months. There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-fense readiness as a result of this proposed sale. TRANSMITTAL NO . 16–07 Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act, as amended Annex Item No. vii (vii) Sensitivity of Technology: The RIM–116C Rolling Airframe Missile is an autonomous (i.e., ‘‘fire and forget’’) light-weight, supersonic, surface-to-air tactical missile for ship self-defense against current and evolving anti-ship cruise missile threats. Advanced technology in the RIM–116C in-cludes dual-mode RF/IR (radio frequency/in-frared) guidance with IR all-the-way capa-bility for non-emitting threats. The highest classification of the hardware, embedded software, and maintenance is CONFIDEN-TIAL. The RIM–116C–2 is a non-tactical te-lemetry round, used primarily for test and training purposes; it includes an unclassified telemeter which replaces the warhead sec-tion. The data set, generated by R1114–116C– 2 is UNCLASSIFIED. The Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM) is a product of a cooperative program with Ger-many and has been executed, since 1976, under a series of governing Memoranda of Understanding/Memoranda of Agreements (MOU/MOAs) for the development, produc-tion, and in-service support between the United States and Germany. A determination has been made that the Government of Qatar can provide substan-tially the same degree of protection for the sensitive technology being released as the U.S. Government. This sale is necessary in furtherance of U.S. foreign policy and na-tional security objectives outlined in the Policy Justification. All defense articles and services listed in this transmittal have been authorized for re-lease and export to the Government of Qatar. f 
HONORING JOHN E. ULMSCHNEIDER Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I recognize the tragic death of a Mary-lander. John E. Ulmschneider of the Prince George’s Fire/EMS Department was killed in the line of duty on Fri-day, April 15, 2016. John Ulmschneider is survived by his wife and daughter. He was known to his friends and colleagues as ‘‘Skillet,’’ a nickname he received after sustaining an injury in high school. It was while he was attending Surrattsville High School in Clinton, MD, that John de-cided to dedicate his life to serving others as firefighter. Before graduating high school, John Ulmschneider worked on the farm of a family friend. It was on that farm that he met Dawn, and the two would later get married. A colleague fondly re-membered him as ‘‘a hard-working country boy.’’ He enjoyed helping peo-ple. Personally and professionally, he was selfless and generous. This altru-ism made him not only a good person, but an ideal public servant. John Ulmschneider worked out of the Landover Hills Fire/EMS Station 830. He was a 13-year veteran of the Prince George’s County Fire/EMS Department and was described as dedicated, hum-ble, and funny. The Prince George’s County Fire/EMS Department is com-posed of nearly 2,000 volunteers, career professionals, and support personnel covering approximately 580 square miles and protecting almost 900,000 people. Marylanders should take solace in knowing that John was able to leave his mark on a department with such immense responsibilities. Maryland’s first responders are some of the best in the country. Their dedi-cation, bravery, and skill are worthy of the highest praise. John Ulmschneider had all of these traits in abundance. I thank the Ulmschneider family for sharing John with the people of Prince George’s County. I also thank John’s fellow first responders and staff at Med Star Southern Maryland Hospital Cen-ter in Clinton, MD, for doing their ut-most to save John. His legacy will never be forgotten, and I join the peo-ple of Prince George’s County in mourning his loss. f

PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS The following petitions and memo-rials were laid before the Senate and were referred or ordered to lie on the table as indicated: 
POM–157. A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of Delegates of the State of West Virginia urging the United States Con-gress to provide funding for the West Vir-ginia National Guard to sustain and enhance its capabilities in its role in a regional catas-trophe and to modernize the antiquated avi-onics of its fleet of C130s and other aircraft to meet global airspace requirements for 2020; to the Committee on Armed Services. H
OUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 20 Whereas, In the event of a regional catas-trophe, West Virginia’s east-west highways, including 1–68 and 1–64 are links to the major exit corridors from the FEMA National Cap-ital Region (NCR) westward and, assuming that a regional catastrophe will likely in-clude Baltimore to the north of the NCR and Richmond to the south of the NCR, westward evacuation utilizing these highways is high-ly likely and is, in fact anticipated; and Whereas, The routes through West Virginia will traverse rural areas that do not have in-frastructure adequate for what could be a mass of evacuees in the worst-case scenario; experience in regional emergencies, such as Superstorm Sandy in 2012, illustrates some shortcomings in planning that is less focused on regions and more on states; and Whereas, West Virginia is perfectly (and geographically) postured to support any emergency or disaster response to the NCR, including mass evacuation westward; and Whereas, FEMA regions do not necessarily represent grouping of states likely to be in-volved in some scenarios; FEMA region III contains the NCR and West Virginia as its western-most edge and in a major catas-trophe, Regions V, with Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, VII with Missouri, and IV with Ken-tucky, Tennessee, and North Carolina are likely to be involved in some combinations; and Whereas, The National Guard, through the use of Emergency Management Assistance Compacts, can operate across state lines to provide vital response capability in security, transportation, medical, housing, commu-nications, command and control, and others based on its dual role in military prepared-ness and state civil support; and Whereas, Military Force Structure as-signed to the National Guard must be consid-ered by Federal Military planners for the dual use they can encounter; National Guard Organizations require personnel, equipment, organization, training, leadership and fund-ing to maintain federal military standards and to be prepared to respond to a domestic emergency or disaster; and Whereas, Regional catastrophic planning is dependent on National Guard assets, capa-bilities and responsiveness; consequently, it is also critical that federal military planners assess the impact of their force structure changes on regional capability needs as I well as those that are state specific; and Whereas, The C–I30 H3 ‘‘Hercules’’ aircraft assigned to the 130th Airlift Wing of the West Virginia National Guard at Yeager Air-port in Charleston, West Virginia will even-tually become obsolete without system mod-ernization to the communication, naviga-tion, and surveillance (CNS) components; National Air Traffic Control (ATC) agencies and the International Civil Aviation Organi-zation (ICAO) are modernizing airspace fast-er than the US Air Force is updating C–130 avionics capabilities; and Whereas, Aircraft component acquisition becomes increasingly difficult as fewer C–130 H aircraft remain in the Air Force inventory and the unique components of the C–130, in-cluding its self contained navigational sys-tem (SCNS), face short term supply chain shortages that could be remedied with air-craft avionics modernization; and Whereas, The contract to perform mainte-nance on aircraft flight computers is re-newed annually and this perpetual reliance on short term contracts increases sustainment cost and challenges mission ef-fectiveness and operational planning; and Whereas, Reliance on short term contracts and antiquated avionics will increase Air Force expense in the long run as it trans-lates to more expensive mission-essential contracts and increased fuel expenditures due to inefficient routing: Now, therefore, be it Resolved by the Legislature of West Virginia, That the Legislature hereby urges the United States Congress to provide funding for the West Virginia National Guard to sus-tain and enhance its capabilities in its role in a regional catastrophe and to modernize the antiquated avionics of its fleet of C–130s and other aircraft to meet global airspace re-quirements for 2020; and be it Further Resolved, That the Clerk of the House of Delegates is hereby directed to for-ward a copy of this resolution to the Presi-dent and Secretary of the United States Sen-ate, the Speaker and Clerk of the House of Representatives and to the members of West Virginia congressional delegation. 
POM–158. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of the State of Tennessee urging the President of the United States and the United States Congress to take immediate action to protect citizens and lawful resi-dents from the consequences resulting from the uncontrolled influx of undocumented im-migrants into this country; to the Com-mittee on the Judiciary. H
OUSE JOINT RESOLUTION NO. 70 Whereas, the federal Department of Home-land Security has set forth in a report, enti-tled Estimates of the Unauthorized Immi-grant Population Residing in the United States: January 20111 that the unauthorized immigrant population totaled 11.5 million in 2011; and Whereas, the U.S. Customs and Border Pro-tection agency apprehended 486,651 individ-uals crossing the borders of the United States in fiscal year 2014 alone; and Whereas, the power to control immigration and naturalization is reserved to the federal government by the provisions of Article I, Section 8, of the United States Constitution, which tasks the legislative branch with es-tablishing uniform rules of naturalization; and Whereas, the explosive growth in numbers of illegal immigrants, including a substan-tial increase in unaccompanied alien chil-dren, over the past few years reflects a fail-ure by the President of the United States, his administration, and the various members of Congress to implement procedures that adequately address this issue; and Whereas, despite the lack of authority granted to the states to fully address the issue of illegal immigration, as evidenced by recent court decisions, including Arizona v. United States, 132 S. Ct. 2492 (2012), the costs of supporting illegal immigrants in this country continues to fall directly to the sev-eral states, and their counties and cities; and

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2419 April 25, 2016 
Whereas, according to the complaint filed by several states against certain officials in the administration in charge of immigration enforcement, the Texas Department of Pub-lic Safety estimated that it was spending $1.3 million per week on troopers and resources to deal with the immigration surge, as well as deploying 1,000 National Guard troops to the border at a cost of $38 million; and Whereas, the Supreme Court of the United States has decreed in Plyler v. Doe, 102 S. Ct. 2382 (1982), that education cannot be denied even to those who have entered this country illegally; and Whereas, Congress has likewise decreed that emergency medical care, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. §§1611 and 1621, cannot be denied even to those who have come here illegally; and Whereas, this General Assembly is fully aware of the growing existence of illegal im-migrants in the various counties of this State, including the 1,294 unaccompanied alien children released to sponsors in this State by the Office of Refugee Resettlement in fiscal year 2014; and Whereas, the costs of illegal immigration present a significant financial burden to each state in the form of expenditures for education, criminal justice, and emergency medical care, a burden this State cannot ab-sorb without jeopardizing the quality of life for its U.S. citizens and lawful immigrant population: Now, therefore, be it Resolved by the House of Representatives of the One Hundred Ninth General Assembly of the State of Tennessee, the Senate Concurring, That even as the members of this General Assembly take decisive steps to address the issue of illegal immigration to the fullest ex-tent of our powers, we strongly urge the President and the Congress of these United States to resolve this issue in a timely and efficient manner, to pass a comprehensive immigration policy that allows those wish-ing to immigrate to this country to do so only in a lawful manner, and to ensure that American society is not threatened by a de-cline in public safety, educational standards, medical accessibility, and the overall stand-ard of living resulting from those who know-ingly choose to enter this country in viola-tion of the law; and be it further Resolved, That the President and the Con-gress of these United States include in any comprehensive immigration policy a revision to existing federal law that would favor U.S. citizens and lawful residents in receiving benefits such as health care, education, and any other government benefits before offer-ing any benefits to those individuals enter-ing this country illegally; and be it further Resolved, That the President and the Con-gress of these United States incorporate into any comprehensive immigration policy a system in which the several states may be fully compensated by the federal government for any financial burdens that result from decisions made in Washington, D.C., with re-gard to illegal immigrants. f

MOURNING THE LOSS AND HON-ORING THE LIFE OF THE ARTIST WHO WILL ALWAYS BE KNOWN AS PRINCE 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 25, 2016 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, it is with a deep sadness and heavy heart that I rise today in tribute to Prince, whose extraordinary talent, creativity, innovation, and imagination touched the hearts and moved the feet of mil-lions of music lovers in America and around the world. Prince transitioned from this life on Thurs-day, April 21, 2016, at Paisley Park, his Chanhassen, Minnesota residential and re-cording complex. He was just 57 years young. Mr. Speaker, it seems inadequate to note that Prince was a singer, songwriter, musician, producer, performing artist, and actor. Whoever said that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts had to be talking about the artist who was formerly known as, but will always be remembered simply as Prince by the legions of fans who loved the way he made them feel about themselves. So renowned were Prince’s innovations, so electrifying was his guitar playing, so soul-af-firming were the songs he penned, and so mesmerizing was his stage presence and un-matched vocal range that Rolling Stone Maga-zine lists Prince as one of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. Prince’s musical career began in 1978, when his debut album ‘‘For You’’ was re-leased, launching one of the most influential and culture shaping careers in the history of the music industry. Prince produced some of the most memo-rable music of his generation, including the signature anthem, the soul-stirring ‘‘Purple Rain,’’ regarded by many as the greatest song of the 1980s. Prince’s unwavering courage and talent lift-ed him to a realm rarely accessible to musi-cians. Although his prolific body of work was the focus his fame, Prince was a citizen of the world and humanitarian whose life could be best summed up by the lyrics in ‘‘Diamonds and Pearls,’’ the hit single he penned: ‘‘If I could I would give you the world.’’ Prince anonymously supported and funded many community improvement organizations, such as ‘‘Yes We Code,’’ which worked with over 15 major technology companies to pro-vide technology training to marginalized inner city youth. Due to his faith as a Jehovah’s Witness he would not speak publicly about his numerous good works but all that knew him celebrated his tireless efforts to make the world a better place. Prince sold over 100 million records world-wide, making him one of the best-selling art-ists of all time, and the recipient of seven Grammy Awards, a Golden Globe Award, and the Academy Award for Best Music Original Score. Widely regarded as one of the greatest guitarists of all time, Prince was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004, in his first year of his eligibility. In addition to possessing one of the world’s most distinctive voices and dance moves, Prince was a virtuoso on every instrument he played—guitar, bass guitar, drums, keyboards, and Linn drum. Mr. Speaker, witnessing in person a per-formance by Prince was an incredible and un-forgettable experience. Prince was proudly different and he inspired generations of fans to unapologetically em-brace, celebrate, and love their authentic selves. My heart goes out to Prince’s family and friends and the infinite number of fans mourn-ing the loss of this music icon, this unique spirit, this incredible force of nature. Mr. Speaker, this is truly what it sounds like when doves cry. With the passing of Prince, the world has lost one of the greatest gifts of all; the pure joy we felt whenever Prince performed one of those songs that made us go crazy and party like it’s 1999, Yes, Prince left us too soon; just like that lit-tle red corvette. As Horatio said of Hamlet: ‘‘Good night sweet Prince, and flights of angels sing thee to thy rest.’’ Mr. Speaker, I request that the House ob-serve a moment of silence in memory of the dearly beloved Prince. We will always remember him and in our hearts will always see him laughing in the Pur-ple Rain. ANICEE LAMOREAUX HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 25, 2016 Mr. PERLMUTTER.

Anicee Lamoreaux is a 7th grader at Rocky Top Middle School and received this award because her determination and hard work have allowed her to overcome adversities. The dedication demonstrated by Anicee Lamoreaux is exemplary of the type of achievement that can be attained with hard work and perseverance.

I have no doubt she will exhibit the same dedication and character in all of her fu-ture accomplishments.

AUTISM AFTER 21 DAY 
HON. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN 
OF MARYLAND  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 25, 2016 Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, in America today, there is a population that has gone un-recognized. The conversation on autism has long ignored Autistic adults. For this reason, I rise to recognize April 21 to be noted as ‘‘Au-tism after 21 Day’’—representing the age when services for children end and services for adulthood begins. In declaring this day, we draw attention to the fact that there are many adults that need to have a country aware of their gifts and chal-lenges. This is a step in helping to create a brighter future for these adults and the people who care about them. I am proud to have organizations in my Congressional district that work hard to ad-dress these needs. In conjunction with their work and the needs of those that are adults on the Autism Spectrum, we are calling for ‘‘Autism after 21 Day’’ to acknowledge the many people who are navigating adulthood and wanting to reach their full potential. With our help, that journey may not be as lonely and isolated; rather, the individuals can be recognized as an important part of our com-munity. Twenty-six years after the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Au-tistic adults deserve access to the goals set by the ADA: equality of opportunity, full participa-tion, independent living, and economic self- sufficiency.

BUSINESS ROUNDTABLE 2016 SUS-TAINABILITY REPORT ‘‘CREATE, GROW, SUSTAIN: PEOPLE AND TECHNOLOGY AT WORK’’ 
HON. FRED UPTON 
OF MICHIGAN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 25, 2016 Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, last Friday, we celebrated Earth Day. Every year on April 22 we recognize how much we have at stake in preserving the wondrous natural resources of not just the United States, but of the entire planet. As someone who has sponsored im-portant legislation to upgrade pipeline safety standards and keep microbeads out of our waters while helping to broker a landmark deal that opened up markets for energy exports and extended tax credits for renewables, I un-derstand the many momentous ways in which we have improved the environment within our great country since the first Earth Day in 1970. And no organization has captured the many ways in which our private businesses have made, and continue to make, huge strides to-ward sustainability than the Business Round-table. But to me and so many of our colleagues, on both sides of the aisle, the unsung heroes in the effort to make our nation cleaner and more abundant are the private companies that develop technologies that are responsible for a cleaner environment. They are the ones who have developed technologies that have helped to clean our Nation’s vital waterways, including the Great Lakes. They have cleaned the air in Los Angeles, where the ‘‘brown layer’’ over the entire basin of 30–40 years ago is a distant memory. This is thanks to breakthroughs from auto manufac-turers and oil refiners alike. Chemical companies are enhancing energy efficiency in our homes and businesses, and increasing the productivity of our farmland. The ability to tap into natural gas that seemed out of reach, if we even knew it ex-isted, has enabled us to radically reduce greenhouse gas emissions into the atmos-phere. The Business Roundtable has done us all a great service by canvassing its members and compiling a document, entitled ‘‘Create, Grow, Sustain: People and Technology at Work’’ that acquaints us with the technologies that these very companies have used so effectively, and the cutting-edge approaches they have devel-oped that will facilitate sustainability long into the future. This report represents a catalog of tech-nologies promise to bring about advances under the heading of sustainability at an even more rapid pace than we seen over the past decades. The future is bright indeed. Mr. Speaker, I hope our colleagues will take the time to review the Business Roundtable 2016 sustainability report so they can see for themselves the exciting technologies being put into commerce by our leading companies. f

IN RECOGNITION OF DR. CHARLES ELACHI, DIRECTOR OF THE JET PROPULSION LABORATORY 
HON. JOHN ABNEY CULBERSON 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 25, 2016 Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor my good friend Dr. Charles Elachi, the Director of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), who plans to retire this June after 45 years of service to the people of the United States of America. Dr. Elachi’s journey to become the Director of JPL is a source of inspiration and encour-agement to every young person in America who dreams of making great discoveries or changing the world around them. Charles Elachi’s life is a true Horatio Alger story. As Dr. Elachi wrote recently in an essay for the Smithsonian, ‘‘How did a boy from an ordi-nary, middle-class family in a little Lebanese village come so far? The answer is deeply connected with what I believed as a child and I still believe today: The United States is a land of freedom and opportunity, where any-thing is possible, and where dreams can and do come true.’’ Growing up in the small Lebanese town of Rayak, Charles remembers meeting ‘‘quite a few American visitors. Over and over again,’’ he said, ‘‘I was struck by their open, positive attitude toward life, their attitude that anything is possible, no holds barred, regardless of family background, religion or color.’’ As a boy, he loved watching the stars at night, and he says watching those stars helped inspire him to study hard at school. He was so suc-cessful at his studies that he distinguished himself as Lebanon’s top science student, an honor which enabled him to attend any univer-sity he chose. He first earned a degree in physics at the University of Grenoble, France, and then earned a degree in engineering at the Poly-technic Institute. When it was time to decide on graduate school, those early positive memories of optimistic fearless Americans in-spired him to go to California, where he earned admission to the California Institute of Technology. He fell in love with southern Cali-fornia, and earned a master’s degree and a doctorate in electrical sciences from Caltech, a master’s degree in geology from UCLA, and a master’s degree in business administration from the University of Southern California. His lifelong dreams about exploring the stars and his exceptional work in college brought him to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 1970. He first worked on Earth observing missions, and then moved on to planetary ex-ploration and astrophysics. His scientific and engineering gifts and his natural talent as a leader led NASA to select Charles as the Science Team Leader on the Space Shuttle’s Imaging Radar. JPL recognized his unique skills and assigned him to be a key part of the Magellan Imaging Radar which was so essen-tial to visualize the surface of Venus through its permanent and total cloud cover for the first time. NASA and JPL were so impressed with his work that he was then chosen to lead the radar science team for the extraordinarily suc-cessful Cassini-Huygens mission to Saturn. Once again, his skill with orbital imaging radar systems proved essential in visualizing the surface of an alien world otherwise forever hidden beneath a permanent worldwide cloak of clouds—Titan. Charles’ work as the leader of this radar team was a vital part of selecting the site for humanity’s first successful landing on an alien world beyond the moon and Mars when the Huygens spacecraft landed on Titan in January, 2005. The Cassini orbiter con-tinues to thrive far beyond its predicted life-span and return groundbreaking scientific dis-coveries about Saturn, its ring system and its immense family of moons. Charles Elachi was appointed as director of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 2001, and under his visionary leadership, JPL scientists and engineers have discovered: conclusive evidence of water ice and long lasting rivers and lakes on Mars; created history’s most de-tailed gravity field and ice maps of Earth; re-turned history’s first samples and close up im-ages of a comet; landed three complex and highly successful spacecraft on Mars; blasted the first artificial crater in a comet to learn what comets are truly made of; landed the first spacecraft on Titan and sampled its surface and atmosphere; discovered lakes and seas of liquid methane on Titan using Charles’ imag-ing radar; created the first deep space tele-scopes to see the universe in ultraviolet and infrared; returned our first true close up im-ages of dwarf planets and asteroids; created the most detailed map ever made of the Moon; discovered millions of black holes; dis-covered the first Earth like exoplanet in the habitable zone of another star; discovered conclusive evidence for immeasurable millions of exoplanets in our galaxy; set a still growing record for driving a spacecraft across the sur-face of another world with the unstoppable Opportunity lander on Mars; discovered the most luminous galaxy in the universe; discov-ered conclusive evidence for liquid water today on the surface of Mars; discovered im-mense geysers of frozen water erupting from a worldwide ocean beneath the frozen surface of Saturn’s moon Enceladus; and laid the groundwork for what most planetary scientists predict could be the first discovery of life be-yond Earth in the vast oceans of Europa. These discoveries will be remembered throughout human history. ‘‘Only the United States could do this!,’’ as Charles vividly re-members a foreign visitor saying on the night a rocket sky crane gently landed the Mars Science Lab on the surface of Mars in August of 2012. Charles was reminded that night of another day he felt the same sort of immense pride in his nation when he took the oath to become a United States citizen in August of 1979. ‘‘In this nation of immigrants,’’ Charles wrote for the Smithsonian, ‘‘especially in science and engineering, where people try new things and solve problems, they don’t ask where you’re from. Instead, they ask who is the best person to help overcome a chal-lenge.’’ ‘‘In other countries, you just don’t find this merging of cultures, this melting pot. I think di-versity truly enriches our society and makes the United States more intellectually and eco-nomically powerful. People from different backgrounds bring different ideas and thought processes. The best ideas rise to the top. I see that happen at NASA and JPL all the time. How else do you land a rover on a plan-et no human has ever visited, or design a robot to capture an asteroid?’’ Charles tells us that ‘‘I believe this uniquely American spirit of optimism, the sense that anything is possible for anyone, is a key rea-son our nation is the world leader in space ex-ploration. . . . That wonderful, very American spirit of opening doors, of pushing the frontier, of pursuing the seemingly impossible—that’s what exploration is all about. When the United States landed on the moon and Neil Arm-strong took that one ‘‘small step’’ on the sur-face, when we landed a rover on Mars, when we deliberately collided with a comet to study its interior, all those milestones made people here feel deep pride as Americans. But I also believe and hope that they made people around the globe feel deep pride as humans, pride in all the positive and amazing things we can accomplish when we work together.’’ Charles Elachi embodies everything that has made America the most prosperous and powerful and freest nation in the history of the world. His life and the scientific discoveries he has left us all as his legacy will inspire us and our children and grandchildren and their de-scendants for all time. Charles Elachi and his extraordinary team of scientists and engineers have made our lives as Americans and as members of the human race far, far richer be-cause he and his team have dared and suc-ceeded in achieving mighty things. All Americans owe this wonderful good man an immeasurable debt of gratitude. We will reap the harvest of his visionary leadership for many, many generations to come. It is my great privilege to be his friend and to stand here today, on behalf of the people of Texas I represent who love NASA and its mission, and on behalf of the United States Congress, to thank Charles Elachi for his devoted service to America, to NASA, to JPL, to science and for helping lead humanity in our greatest era of discovery. May God always bless you and you and your family, Charles.
