IN RECOGNITION OF ROCCO SACRAMONE 
HON. CAROLYN B. MALONEY 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, December 27, 2016 Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Rocco Sacramone, Chef and owner and of Trattoria L’Incontro and restaurateur, for his achieve-ments and outstanding devotion to the better-ment of the Queens community. Since its opening in 1999, Trattoria L’Incontro has been a staple of the Astoria community. Under the direction of Chef Sacramone and Jack Brucculeri, Trattoria L’Incontro quickly became a ‘‘must place’’ to dine. In 2005 the restaurant was rated as one of the top two Italian restaurants in New York by Zagat, providing the highest level of quality and service in a unique setting that reflects Mr. Sacramone’s hometown in Italy. Despite his tremendous successes, Mr. Sacramone came from humble beginnings. Born in Orsonga, a small town in Abruzzo, Italy, Mr. Sacramone came to the United States with his family in 1970. At the age of 14, Mr. Sacramone began his work in res-taurants as a dishwasher in a popular Italian restaurant in Queens. Working long hours in the kitchen, he rose through the ranks and quickly became manager at Nino’s Restaurant in Greenwich Village, where he learned the front of house aspect of the restaurant busi-ness. Throughout his career, Mr. Sacramone has received numerous accolades from the New York Times, Newsday and Timeout. Mr. Sacramone attributes much of his success to his team and loving family, especially his mother Tina who worked alongside him in the kitchen and taught him his respect and love for the art of cooking. Mr. Sacramone continues to be a pillar of his community by devoting his time and sup-port to many local organizations, including Mount Sinai Hospital of Queens, United Civic Community Association, SHAREing and CAREing and L.I.C./Astoria Kiwanis Club. Mr. Sacramone also plans to travel to Italy to help the victims of the recent earthquake. Addition-ally, his generous, unending support and char-ity to the Holy Name Society of St. Francis of Assisi Church makes the ‘‘Taste of Italy’’ Scholarship fundraiser a tremendous success. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Mr. Sacramone for his tremendous achievements and continued generosity, dedi-cation and support to his community. IN RECOGNITION OF JONATHAN DARCHE HON. CAROLYN B. MALONEY 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, December 27, 2016 Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Jonathan Darche for his undying devotion to improving the lives of New Yorkers through public serv-ice. Because of the dedication that Mr. Darche has shown to his community in Astoria, he is being honored at Taminent Regular Demo-cratic Club’s 85th Annual Dinner Dance with the Taminent Political Activism Award. Mr. Darche, a life-long resident of Queens, graduated from Empire State College and re-ceived his law degree from the City University of New York School of Law. Mr. Darche began his career in public service working for Sen-ator C
HARLES E. S CHUMER . After graduating from law school, he continued his commitment to the people of Queens as an Assistant Dis-trict Attorney at the Queens County District At-torney’s Office, where he met his wife, Samantha Darche, Chief of Staff for Assemblywoman Aravella Simotas. Mr. Darche’s contributions to his community have by no means gone unnoticed. He has re-ceived numerous rewards for his dedicated public service, including the Narcotics Inves-tigation Bureau Commendation and the New York State Bar Association Citation for Achievement in Public Service. In November 2014, Mr. Darche was pro-moted to Chief Prosecutor of the New York City Civilian Complaint Review Board after his time spent serving as the Deputy Chief Pros-ecutor and the Acting Chief of Investigations at the agency. Mr. Darche’s dedication to service extends past his career. He is incredibly active in his Astoria community. Mr. Darche’s many roles include Corresponding Secretary for the Queens County Brandeis Association, member of the Taminent Regular Democratic Club, member of the Astoria Center of Israel and member of the United Community Civic Asso-ciation. Mr. Darche lives in Astoria with his wife and their two-year-old son, Moses. Mr. Darche has demonstrated tireless dedi-cation to his community throughout his entire career. As both a hardworking attorney and community servant, Jonathan Darche consist-ently devotes his time and effort to improving the lives of those around him, with much suc-cess. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the incredible accomplishments and contributions of Jonathan Darche, a man who has undeniably made his community a better place.

He currently resides in Hewlett Harbor with his partner, Dr. Fidel Abreu. Community involvement is the foundation of a successful city, and Mr. Serao exemplifies commitment to his community through his years of active service to local groups, organi-zations and elected officials. It is a privilege for me to represent a district with dedicated citizens, like Michael Serao, who work con-stantly to improve our city. Michael Serao con-sistently devotes his time and effort to improv-ing the lives of those around him, with great success.

The IATSE was founded in 1893 when rep-resentatives of stagehands working in eleven cities met in New York and pledged to support each others’ efforts to establish fair wages and working conditions for their members. The union has since evolved to embrace the devel-opment of new entertainment mediums, craft expansion, technological innovation and geo-graphic growth. Today, the over 130,000 members work in all forms of live theater, mo-tion picture and television production, trade shows and exhibitions, television broadcasting, and concerts as well as the equipment and construction shops that support all these areas of the entertainment industry. John Ford is a third generation member of IATSE Local 52 Motion Picture Studio Me-chanics, and he has been a member since 1978. He served on the Executive Board as the Property Department Representative from 1992 to 1998. Mr. Ford also served as Sec-retary and Treasurer from 1999 to April 2004. In addition to serving as the President and Business Manager since April 2004, John Ford serves as a Trustee on the Motion Pic-ture Industry Pension and Health Plans. Mr. Ford presently serves as a Trustee on the Local 52 401k Plan. He also currently serves as the International Vice President of the Ex-ecutive Board of IATSE, a position to which he was elected in July of 2006. The entertainment industry has played a strong role in our great city by providing good paying jobs to thousands of workers. IATSE ensures that stagehands receive fair pay and good benefits for their essential work. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating the extraordinary work that John Ford has done for the IATSE and his larger impact on the great city of New York.
