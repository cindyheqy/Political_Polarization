Bless the Members of this assembly,

Your greater honor and glory.

HONORING ANTHONY ‘‘TONY’’ 
NEAL HUNLEY 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, March 6, 2015 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to honor the life of Anthony ‘‘Tony’’ Neal Hunley, who passed away on January 25, 2015, after sixty remarkable years. 
Tony devoted his life to public service, in-
cluding an exemplary thirty-five year career in local law enforcement. His commitment and devotion for the betterment of his community touched countless people. Born in Sac-ramento, Tony felt a deep connection to his local region. 
Tony began his service as a teenager, 
working in the Civil Air Patrol and the Fairfield High ROTC, as a member of the class of 1972. After graduating from the police acad-emy, he went on to serve his community for a combined thirty-five years, first in the Fair-field Police Department as a police dispatcher, and then as a police officer. He transferred to the Concord Police Department in 1986, a job and a community he was proud to serve until his medical retirement in 2008, and where he was awarded Policeman of the Year. 
Tony had a great sense of adventure and 
enjoyed flying single engine airplanes, riding motorcycles and auto racing. He also found great pleasure in woodworking and golf, and was an avid reader. Most important of all was his family, whom he loved beyond measure. 
Tony was a compassionate officer with a 
great sense of humor, and his upbeat attitude was contagious. Mr. Speaker, it is appropriate at this time that we honor and thank Anthony ‘‘Tony’’ Neal Hunley for his life of service to a grateful community.

PAYING TRIBUTE TO THE LIFE OF 
PHILLIP LEVINE 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, March 6, 2015 
Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
pay tribute to the life of Phillip Levine of Fres-no, California who recently passed away at the age of 87. He leaves behind his loving family including his wife Frances J. Artley, three sons, Mark, John and Teddy, five grand-children and one great grandchild. 
Mr. Levine was born on January 10, 1928 in 
Detroit, Michigan, but has called Fresno home since 1958. The son of Russian-Jewish immi-grants, Levine was born and raised in indus-trial Detroit where he began working in the auto factories at the age of 14. He earned his Bachelor’s degree from Wayne State Univer-sity in 1950 and later earned a Master’s de-gree in Fine Arts from the University of Iowa in 1957. After receiving his graduate degree, he came to California where he began teach-
ing at California State University, Fresno. 
He went on to teach at Fresno State for 34 
years. It was there that he built a nationally recognized program in Creative Writing that in-spired many graduates to become illustrious poets. He retired in 1992 but remained deeply connected to the University. Although Levine held teaching positions at some of the most prestigious universities in the land, including New York University, Columbia University, Princeton and the University of California at Berkeley, he always returned to his home in Fresno. 
As a poetry writer, Mr. Levine celebrated 
working people, and his words both resonated and uplifted them. He wrote more than 21 col-lections of poetry and in 1995 received the Pulitzer Prize for his poem ‘‘The Simple Truth.’’ He won the National Book Award in 1991 for ‘‘What work is’’ and in 2013 he was honored with the Wallace Stevens Award which is given annually to recognize ‘‘out-standing and proven mastery in the art of po-etry.’’ In 2011, Mr. Levine was named as the 18th Poet Laureate of the United States, being declared one of America’s greatest narrative poets by Librarian of Congress, James H. Billington. While achieving numerous suc-cesses and accolades for his work, he consist-ently maintained that the success of his Fres-no State students was one of his biggest re-wards. 
Mr. Levine was truly an honorable man with 
a strong commitment to family, friends and his country that will live on in lives of the many people he touched. His passion for writing, education, and his community will be remem-bered by all who knew him. I am honored and humbled to join his family in celebrating the life of this amazing man who will never be for-gotten. 
Mr. Speaker, it is with great respect that I 
ask my colleagues in the House of Represent-atives to join me in saying farewell to Mr. Phil-lip Levine, a man full of love for life. His gen-uine character, commitment to family and community will be greatly missed.

HIGH SCHOOL WRESTLING CHAM-
PIONSHIP CONGRESSIONAL TRIB-UTE 
HON. SCOTT R. TIPTON 
OF COLORADO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, March 6, 2015 
Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
honor six athletes from Pueblo County who wrestled fearlessly the weekend of February 20th to win state titles in the Class 3A and 4A finals. On the road to their championship, these young men showed grit and determina-tion, overcoming their adversaries on the mat while bringing pride to their respective schools and the county as a whole. To formally ac-knowledge their distinction and excellence, I stand to recognize: From Pueblo County High School: Hunter 
Willits, Chris Sandoval, and Josiah Nava, 
From Pueblo South High School: Austin 
Zuniga, 
From Pueblo East High School: Jacob 
Robles, 
And from Dolores Huerta Preparatory High 
School: Marcus Garcia. 
Like many State Championship runs, Pueb-
lo’s wrestlers encountered emotional setbacks. After missing weight by one-tenth of a pound, Willits twin brother, Grant, a title favorite, was eliminated from the competition. The team was devastated by the news yet showed tre-mendous fortitude, rallying to win their three final matches. 
Mr. Speaker, it is truly an honor to recog-
nize each of these fine athletes. In a sport re-nowned for the extreme physical and mental conditions the human body is subjected to, these young men have demonstrated tenacity, tireless work ethic, and relentless commitment to success that brings honor to their schools and inspires their communities.

TRIBUTE TO THE LIFE OF SUE 
LANDSKE 
HON. LUKE MESSER 
OF INDIANA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, March 6, 2015 
Mr. MESSER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
pay tribute to the life of Sue Landske, a former Indiana State Senator and a truly admirable Hoosier. 
Sue was a devoted wife to her husband Bill, 
the loving mother to five children, and grand-mother to eight grandchildren. While raising her five children, Sue started her own busi-ness before being elected to the Indiana State Senate in 1984. Not only was Sue one of the longest serving state legislators from north-west Indiana, but she was also the second highest ranking member of the Indiana Senate upon her retirement in 2014. Sue was at the forefront of many legislative accomplishments, most specifically the ‘‘Lemon Law’’ that pro-tected consumers against the purchase of de-fective vehicles, a living-will policy that gave adults medical treatment choices if they were incapacitated, and free tuition at state funded higher education institutions for recipients of the Hoosier Purple Heart award. During her spare time, Sue loved camping with her hus-band, visiting her children at their military posts around the globe, and spending as much time as she could with her grand-children. 
She also served as a Member of the State 
Committee of the Indiana Republican Party. That is where we became friends. I always ad-mired Sue’s wisdom, candor, and civility. She was an important part of the Party’s achieve-ments during the Mitch Daniels years. 
Today, it is my privilege to honor the life of 
former State Senator Sue Landske. My thoughts and prayers go out to Sue’s family,

VFW POST 6996 
HON. JASON SMITH 
OF MISSOURI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, March 6, 2015 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the 50th Anniversary of Wash-ington County Memorial Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 6996. VFW Post 6996 was estab-lished in 1965 in Potosi, Missouri. Since then, members of Post 6996 have contributed countless volunteer hours in the Washington County community. Their selfless acts con-tinue to set an admirable example for all. 
VFW Post 6996 is comprised of members 
who have served honorably in foreign wars or overseas operations. These dedicated vet-erans seek to continue serving the American people and their fellow veterans. This non-profit service organization embodies the spirit of service and generosity by supporting troops currently overseas and ensuring returning vet-erans have access to health care, counseling, and housing. 
For their many years of service and commit-
ment to helping others, it is my pleasure to recognize the 50th Anniversary of Washington County Memorial VFW Post 6996 in the House of Representatives.

RESOLUTION COMMEMORATING 
THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE SELMA VOTING RIGHTS MARCH WITH THE ISSUANCE OF A POST-AL STAMP 
HON. JOYCE BEATTY 
OF OHIO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, March 6, 2015 
Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, today I intro-
duced a bipartisan resolution, House Concur-rent Resolution 23, that would honor the Selma to Montgomery, Alabama marches with a commemorative stamp. 
I thank the 102 House Members who co- 
sponsored this resolution and leading spon-sors Congressman B
YRNE , Congressman 
HURD, and Congresswoman S EWELL . 
The Selma Voting Rights March was a piv-
otal moment in our history that brought to-gether Americans to march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama 50 years ago. 
This stamp celebrates the march and re-
minds us to protect voting rights. 
For 125 years the Postal Service has been 
issuing stamps that celebrate cultural mile-stones and the unique history of our nation. 
Surely the protection of voting rights is a 
landmark development in our nation’s develop-ment. 
It is my hope that as we remember the 
struggles of discrimination and inequality we lift our hearts and unite to find bridges to equality and justice. 
I ask that all Members unite and join with 
me in commemorating this critical watershed event. INTRODUCTION OF THE VISION 
ZERO ACT OF 2015 
HON. EARL BLUMENAUER 
OF OREGON  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, March 6, 2015 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, our com-
munities need to be safer. More than 33,000 Americans die on our roadways each year, yet this is accepted as inevitability. Even more concerning, fatalities of our most vulnerable road users—pedestrians and bicyclists—make up a growing share of those deaths, with pe-destrian fatalities increasing 16% from 2009 to 2014. People who die on our streets are disproportionally children, seniors, and people from low income or minority communities. 
Communities across the country are recog-
nizing that there is only one number of accept-able deaths on our streets: zero. ‘‘Vision Zero’’ is the goal of eliminating all transportation-re-lated fatalities, including pedestrians, bicyclists, transit users, motorists and pas-sengers. Cities from New York to San Diego are implementing interagency Vision Zero plans connecting engineering, education, and enforcement, to reach the goal of ending transportation deaths. 
Congress should encourage this innovative 
approach to transportation safety, and today I’m pleased to introduce the Vision Zero Act of 2015 with my colleague, Representative B
UCHANAN . This bill provides local commu-
nities of all sizes with funding and best prac-tices to plan and implement a Vision Zero framework. We should no longer accept bicy-cle and pedestrian fatalities as harsh reality, and this bill gives us the tools to reverse this trend.

HONORING MS. DORIS GENTRY 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, March 6, 2015 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to honor Doris Gentry and the Human Trafficking Steering Committee for the planning and implementation of the first Napa Conference on Human Trafficking. Ms. Gentry saw the need to bring awareness on this im-portant issue, created and led a steering com-mittee made up of the honorable law enforce-ment officers of Napa County, and has been working hard to bring this conference to fru-ition. 
Human trafficking affects as many as twen-
ty-seven million people worldwide, and as many as eighty percent of the victims of human trafficking are former foster youth, but it is both a global and a local problem. The ef-fort by individuals, businesses, organizations, and governing bodies to promote the observ-ance of Human Trafficking Awareness on March 13th of 2015 represents one of the many examples of the ongoing commitment to raise awareness of and to actively oppose human trafficking. 
For Ms. Gentry, philanthropy and vol-
unteerism has been a life-long activity. She has led numerous boards and organizations dedicated to making our community a better place to live, work, and raise a family, and this conference is yet another demonstration of her 
devotion. Ms. Gentry is also a foster mom to one hundred teen boys, and has four children and six grand children of her own. 
I am proud to represent a district with prin-
cipled, community-minded and globally con-scious people such as Doris Gentry. Mr. Speaker, Ms. Gentry and the Human Traf-ficking Steering Committee deserve to be rec-ognized and honored here today.

H.R. 280 AND H.R. 294, REFORMS TO 
IMPROVE THE CARE FOR VET-ERANS WHO HAVE SACRIFICED SO MUCH FOR OUR NATION 
HON. ANDER CRENSHAW 
OF FLORIDA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, March 6, 2015 
Mr. CRENSHAW. Mr. Speaker, on Monday, 
March 2, due to inclement weather I was un-able to vote on H.R. 280 ‘Authorizing Sec-retary of Veterans Affairs to Recoup Bonuses and Awards’ and H.R. 294 the ‘Long-Term Care Veterans Choice Act’. If I had been present I would have voted ‘‘yes’’ on the pas-sage of both bills as these reforms would serve to improve the care of our Veterans who have sacrificed so much for our nation. These bills respectively improve the ability of the Vet-erans Administration to provide for the well being of those who have given so much for this nation, and expand the power of that De-partment to hold its employees accountable when they fall short of upholding that sacred duty. 
Over the past year, the Department of Vet-
erans Affairs has received scrutiny on issues that affect the care and benefits of our Vet-erans. Congress has taken action, along with the Department’s Office of the Inspector Gen-eral to investigate these wrongdoings. One finding of these investigations was the des-picable act of manipulating the Department’s appointment system to hide evidence of in-creased wait times for medical appointments, and the doctoring of medical records to the same effect. 
I believe these acts are despicable and the 
Department of Veterans Affairs must be held accountable. Veterans Affairs employees are placed in positions of special trust and con-fidence and are charged with the sacred duty of caring for those who have sacrificed for the security of this nation. This bill, H.R. 280, pro-vides the Secretary of Veterans Affairs more authority to hold accountable those employees who break faith with this obligation. While em-ployees would be afforded due process prior to being fined for misconduct, the Secretary’s decision would be final and could not be ap-pealed to any other agency or court. No sys-tem is perfect and no person is perfect. But the American people entrust the Secretary of Veterans Affairs with the responsibility of car-ing for our Veterans—which is why it is critical to empower that Department’s leaders with the authority to hold their employees accountable for their actions. 
My District in Jacksonville, Florida is one of 
the most popular retirement locations for Vet-erans. So this bill, H.R. 294 the ‘Long-Term Care Veterans Choice Act’, hits very close to home. As our Veterans enter the twilight of their lives, they often find themselves needing

increased daily care, which the Department of 
Veterans Affairs is required by law to provide. This care is given by way of veterans nursing homes, which are currently the only institu-tions capable of fulfilling the Department’s obli-gation to provide such services. However, this ‘‘one size fits all’’ method of caring for our Vet-erans is not always the most appropriate for their condition or medical situation. 
H.R. 294 corrects this situation by author-
izing the Department of Veterans Affairs to fund Medical Foster Home care for Veterans whose situation is conducive to receiving long term care in a non-institutional setting. Medical Foster Care provides actual homes for Vet-erans and families willing to accept the chal-lenge of caring for them. Many of these fami-lies are themselves retired service members, nurses, and doctors that are able to garner a little extra money and a purpose for getting out of bed every day. There is no downside to this bill. It provides a choice for our Veterans to receive the kind of care they want and de-serve in a fiscally responsible manner. I can’t think of a better way to honor their service and sacrifice. 
Therefore, Mr. Speaker, had I been present 
for these votes, I would have placed my full support behind their passage.

HONORING THE LIFE OF JERRY 
TARKANIAN 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, March 6, 2015 
Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today along 
with my colleague, Mr. N UNES to honor the life 
of Jerry Tarkanian, who passed away on Feb-ruary 11, 2015, at the age of 84. Jerry’s family and friends as well as people throughout the nation, will miss him greatly as he dedicated much of his life to inspiring young athletes in countless communities. 
Although Jerry was most recognized for his 
achievements as the basketball coach for the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, in the Cen-tral Valley we remember Jerry as Fresno State’s spirited and energetic former head basketball coach. Fresno State was Jerry’s alma mater, and the community is very proud to say so. 
Born in Euclid, Ohio, Jerry was the son of 
Armenian immigrants. He moved halfway across the country, to California, to get an education and play basketball. In 1955, he graduated from Fresno State, and later earned his master’s degree in Educational Manage-ment from the University of Redlands. 
Jerry was an enthusiastic coach for 31 
years who began his basketball coaching ca-reer at San Joaquin Memorial High School in Fresno. Jerry coached his first Division I team at California State University, Long Beach from 1968–1973. As a coach during the late 60s, his courage defied social norms of the time, becoming one of the first coaches to start more than three African-American play-ers. Jerry took an intense interest in his play-ers and wanted them to succeed both on and off the court. He was a man of encouragement who reached out to young men who lived in inner-cities and normally would not have ac-cess to a higher education. I once had the pleasure of having a conversation about Jerry Tarkanian with Magic Johnson. He told me 
that Coach Jerry Tarkanian was known around inner city playgrounds in America as the coach of second chances. In the Central Val-ley, we are truly grateful for those second chances. 
In 1973, Jerry moved to Nevada to become 
head coach at UNLV. He is now remembered as the determined individual who turned around the basketball program at UNLV and made it into a winning program. Jerry returned to Fresno and coached at Fresno State from 1995–2002. While coaching at Fresno state, his teams had a total of six 20-win seasons for a total of 153 victories. In total, his teams had 729 victories, a National championship for UNLV in 1990, and four straight NCAA tour-nament appearances for Long Beach State. Additionally, Jerry coached 42 players who were drafted by the NBA, including 12 first- round selections. Due to the efforts made by Jerry and the ‘‘Stadium Builders’’ in the mid 1990s, Save mart Center was built. For years, there had been discussions regarding an on- campus arena at Fresno State, but it was not made a reality until Jerry began his successful coaching career at the university. When he fin-ished his coaching career, Jerry worked as the Senior Development Consultant for Save mart Center. 
In 2013, Tarkanian was elected to the 
Naismith Memorial Hall of Fame, an honor his fellow coaches argued for years was long overdue. Though hospitalized in the summer for heart problems and weakened by a variety of ills, he went on stage with a walker at the induction ceremony. 
Jerry is appreciated by individuals through-
out our nation, but he is especially treasured in Fresno, California. Central Valley residents take pride in Fresno State, and it was an honor to have Jerry lead our Fresno State Bulldogs on the basketball court. Although I come to you with a heavy heart, I am honored to have known such an admirable man. 
Mr. Speaker, it is with great respect that Mr. 
N
UNES and I ask our colleagues in the House 
of Representatives to join us in honoring the life of Coach Jerry Tarkanian, as he is remem-bered for all of the contributions that he has made to individuals throughout the country as well as the people to whom he gave a second chance.

JESSE REED CHAMPION TRIBUTE 
HON. SCOTT R. TIPTON 
OF COLORADO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, March 6, 2015 
Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in 
honor of Mr. Jesse Reed. Mr. Reed cemented his name in Colorado high-school wrestling history on February 20th, 2015, at the Colo-rado State High School Wrestling Champion-ships in Denver, Colorado, by winning his fourth consecutive state title. 
Jesse, a senior at Paonia Junior-Senior 
High School, began his dominant career as a freshman, winning the 113-pound state title. In an incredible show of dedication and pure mental toughness, Jesse overcame a MCL tear during his sophomore football season, and returned to the mat that sophomore winter and battled his way to the 120-pound state title. In a sport renowned for the extreme physical and mental conditions, in which ath-
letes are subject to match after match, it is a testament to Jesse’s resolve that he was able to prevail even without a 100 percent healthy knee. 
Following another dominant season during 
his junior year and his third state title, Jesse, now in his senior year, knew that he had the opportunity to become the 18th wrestler in Colorado State history to win four consecutive titles. In a 4–1 decision, not only did Reed join that elite group but he also capped off an im-pressive final two seasons in which he didn’t lose a single match. 
Mr. Speaker, Jesse Reed’s tenacity, unwill-
ingness to succumb to adversity, and unparal-leled success is truly to be admired and for that I congratulate him. Although he has wres-tled his last match for the Eagles, his commit-ment to the sport of wrestling and to Paonia Junior-Senior High School will remain on the mat and inspire the Eagles who follow in his footsteps.

COMMEMORATING 50TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF BLOODY SUNDAY, TURNAROUND TUESDAY, AND THE FINAL MARCH FROM SELMA TO MONTGOMERY 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, March 6, 2015 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, fifty years 
ago tomorrow, in Selma, Alabama, hundreds of heroic souls risked their lives for freedom and to secure the right to vote for all Ameri-cans by their participation in marches for vot-ing rights on ‘‘Bloody Sunday,’’ ‘‘Turnaround Tuesday,’’ or the final, completed march from Selma to Montgomery. 
Those ‘‘foot soldiers’’ of Selma, brave and 
determined men and women, boys and girls, persons of all races and creeds, loved their country so much that they were willing to risk their lives to make it better, to bring it even closer to its founding ideals. 
The foot soldiers marched because they be-
lieved that all persons have dignity and the right to equal treatment under the law, and in the making of the laws, which is the funda-mental essence of the right to vote. 
On March 15, 1965, before a joint session 
of the Congress and the eyes of the nation, President Lyndon Johnson explained to the nation the significance of ‘‘Bloody Sunday’’: 
I speak tonight for the dignity of man and 
the destiny of democracy. . . . 
At times history and fate meet at a single 
time in a single place to shape a turning point in man’s unending search for freedom. 
So it was at Lexington and Concord. So it was a century ago at Appomattox. So it was last week in Selma, Alabama. 
The previous Sunday, March 7, 1965, more 
than 600 civil rights demonstrators, including our beloved colleague, Congressman J
OHN 
LEWIS of Georgia, were brutally attacked by 
state and local police at the Edmund Pettus Bridge as they marched from Selma to Mont-gomery in support of the right to vote. 
‘‘Bloody Sunday’’ was a defining moment in 
American history because it crystallized for the nation the necessity of enacting a strong and effective federal law to protect the right to vote of every American.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E316 March 6, 2015 
No one who witnessed the violence and 
brutally suffered by the foot soldiers for justice who gathered at the Edmund Pettus Bridge will ever forget it; the images are deeply seared in the American memory and experi-ence. 
Mr. Speaker, what is so moving, heroic, and 
awe-inspiring is that the foot soldiers of Selma faced their heavily armed adversaries fortified only by their love for their country and for each other and their audacious faith in a right-
eous cause. 
The example set by the foot soldiers of 
Selma showed everyone, here in America and around the world, that there is no force on earth as powerful as an idea whose time has come. 
These great but nameless persons won the 
Battle of Selma and helped redeem the great-est nation on earth. 
But we should not forget that the victory 
came at great cost and that many good and dear persons lost their lives to win for others the right to vote. 
Men like Jimmy Lee Jackson, who was shot 
by Alabama state trooper as he tried to protect his mother and grandmother from being beat-en for participating in a peaceful voting rights march in Marion, Alabama. 
Women like Viola Liuzzo, a housewife and 
mother of five, who had journeyed to Selma from Detroit to join the protests after wit-nessing on television the events at Edmund Pettus Bridge on ‘‘Bloody Sunday’’ and who was shot and killed by Klansmen while driving 
back from a trip shuttling fellow voting rights marchers to the Montgomery airport. 
Persons of faith, goodwill, and non-violence 
like the Reverend James Reeb of Boston, a minister from Boston who heeded the call of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. to come to Selma and who succumbed to the head in-juries he suffered at the hands of his white su-premacists attackers on March 9, two days after Bloody Sunday. 
Mr. Speaker, in the face of unspeakable 
hostility, violence, brutality, and hatred, the foot soldiers of Selma would not be deterred— would not be moved—would not be turned around. 
They kept their eyes on the prize and held 
on. 
And help came the very next week when 
President Johnson announced to the nation that he would send to Congress for immediate action a law designed to eliminate illegal bar-
riers to the right to vote by striking down ‘‘re-strictions to voting in all elections—Federal, State, and local—which have been used to deny Negroes the right to vote.’’ 
On August 6, 1965, that legislation—the 
Voting Rights Act of 1965—was signed into law by President Johnson and for the next 48 years did more to expand our democracy and empower racial and language minorities than any act of government since the Emancipation Proclamation and adoption of the Civil War Amendments. But our work is not done; the dreams of Dr. 
King and of all those who gave their lives in the struggle for justice are not behind us but still before us. 
Mr. Speaker, in the wake of the Supreme 
Court’s 2013 ruling in Shelby County v. Hold-er, which severely crippled the Voting Rights Act, we have seen many states across our na-tion move to enact legislation designed to limit the ability of women, the elderly, racial and language minorities to exercise their right to vote. 
To honor the memory of the foot soldiers of 
Selma, we must rededicate ourselves to a great task remaining before us—to repair the damage done to the Voting Rights Act by working to pass H.R. 885, the Voting Rights Amendments Act of 2015, which I am proud to be one of the original co-sponsors. 
As I have stated many times, the 1965 Vot-
ing Rights Act is no ordinary piece of legisla-tion. 
For millions of Americans, and for many in 
Congress, it is sacred treasure, earned by the sweat and toil and tears and blood of ordinary Americans who showed the world it was pos-sible to accomplish extraordinary things. 
As we remember and honor the foot sol-
diers of Selma, let us resolve also to restore the Voting Rights Act of 1965, so that it re-mains a lasting monument to their heroism and devotion to the country they loved.
