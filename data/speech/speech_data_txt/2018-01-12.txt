IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, January 9, 2018 Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 676. H. Res. 676 supports the rights of the peo-ple of Iran to free expression, condemns the Iranian regime for its crackdown on legitimate protests, and displays American support for peaceful Iranian protestors. H. Res. 676 rec-ognizes the rights of Iranians to peaceful forms of free expression. On December 28, 2017, Iranians in the city of Mashad began protesting against the Ira-nian regime. The protestors expressed eco-nomic grievances, frustrations over wide-spread corruption, and disapproval of the re-gime’s destabilizing support for terrorist groups. This message held sway with many Iranians and protests swiftly spread across the country. The Iranian regime has responded harshly to these protests. The regime has shut down mobile internet access and blocked and pressured companies to cut off social media applications that activists use to publicize pro-tests. Consequently, H. Res. 676 provides Congress authority to license the provision of communications technology to Iran so that people can continue to express themselves freely. The Iranian regime has also engaged in a series of significant human rights abuses and major corruption cases. The Department of State strongly rebukes the Iranian regime’s arrest of peaceful protestors, significant cor-ruption, and destabilizing activities abroad. H. Res. 676 gives Congress the authority to des-ignate and sanction elements of the Iranian re-gime involved in these abuses. This legislation is important for the United States because it emphasizes to Americans and citizens around the world that America is not afraid to stand up to defend the principles upon which our country was formed. I’ve long been a proponent of encouraging free and fair democracies and condemned authoritarianism abroad. As a member of the Judiciary committee, I have spent my tenure in Congress fighting for human and civil rights. Standing up for the rights of all people is of the utmost importance to me. Thus, it is with great pride that I support H. Res. 676 and urge my fellow members to do the same. f 
HUD AFFH RULE CHANGE 
HON. PRAMILA JAYAPAL 
OF WASHINGTON  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, January 12, 2018 Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, on Friday, the Department of Housing and Urban Develop-ment announced that it would effectively delay until 2025 the implementation of the Affirma-tively Furthering Fair Housing rule that will help communities finally realize the goals of the Fair Housing Act. This year is the 50th anniversary of that landmark law, which prohibits housing dis-crimination, and the AFFH rule aims to ensure our communities have the tools necessary to comply with it. Despite the law’s passage 50 years ago, segregation still plagues our com-munities, resulting in grave inequities in all as-pects of life. This is unacceptable. In 2015, after years of public input, the Obama administration finalized the rule, taking the first meaningful steps to empower commu-nities to develop solutions that better address the housing needs of all of their residents. The AFFH rule reaffirms the strongly held American belief that your zip code should not determine your access to opportunity. But by delaying the rule, HUD is making it clear that equity and fair housing is not a priority of this administration. Housing equity is not a choice—it’s the law.

IN RECOGNITION OF MR. JAMES GANDY 
HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, January 12, 2018 Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the exemplary work of Mr. James Gandy and congratulate him on his retirement. Mr. Gandy has served as the President of the Frisco Economic Development Corporation (FEDC) for 22 years, and in that time, has wit-nessed firsthand the economic boom that transformed Frisco from a small farm town to the economic hub it is today. During his tenure, the FEDC facilitated more than 345 projects with an economic impact of $31.1 billion to the Dallas-Fort Worth Metro-politan area. As a result of his work, more than 27,000 direct on-site jobs have been cre-ated, amounting to one fifth of the jobs in Fris-co today. Mr. Gandy played a key role in bringing the Stonebriar Centre Mall and glob-ally recognized brands—including the Dallas Cowboys—to this once-small town. As a direct result of the completion of these projects, Fris-co is the proud host to more than 6 million visitors per year. Mr. Gandy’s record of achievement does not stop there. This Frisco community leader was integral to forging public-private partnerships to create sports and entertainment venues, in-cluding the Ford Center at the Star, the Dr. Pepper Ballpark and Arena, the Toyota Sta-dium, and the Frisco Superdome. As a result of his hard work, Mr. Gandy has received attention not only at the local level, but also from around our state. Under his leadership, the FEDC was awarded the 2017 Economic Development Leadership/Innovation award from the North Texas Chapter of CoreNet Global. The Dallas Business Journal, in the year 2012 and 2015, ranked the FEDC as number one among North Texas economic development agencies, and the FEDC was recognized as high performing in both 2013 and 2016 by Atlas Advertising. He is truly an exemplary North Texas lead-er. Before serving on the FEDC, Mr. Gandy served on the Jackson County Chamber of Commerce as the Director of Economic Devel-opment for the City of Seguin, and as the President of the San Marcos Chamber of Commerce. It is clear that Mr. Gandy has worked tire-lessly to bolster the Frisco economy. Under his leadership at FEDC, the City of Frisco has seen an increase of the tax base of 38 times what it was when he took office. On behalf of the citizens and businesses of Frisco, I want to thank James Gandy for the unparalleled im-pact he has made on the city and wish him a very happy retirement. f 
SECURING DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY FIREARMS ACT OF 2O17 
SPEECH OF  
HON. HENRY C. ‘‘HANK’’ JOHNSON, JR. 
OF GEORGIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, January 9, 2018 Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4433. H.R. 4433, the Securing DHS Firearms Act of 2017, makes the Under Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) re-sponsible for the security of sensitive assets, such as badges, firearms, or other weapons. This legislation directs the DHS’s Under Secretary to create and disseminate a direc-tive. This directive should designate which as-sets should be classified as sensitive, the re-quirements for securing and safeguarding sen-sitive assets, and the methods to record and report lost assets. H.R. 4433 also directs the Under Secretary to revise the Personal Prop-erty Asset Management Program Manual, which contains the procedures and trainings for safeguarding sensitive assets, guides for recording lost assets, and requirements that a lost asset file contain both a DHS report and a corresponding police report. H.R. 4433 is vital to safeguard sensitive as-sets that could result in loss of life and signifi-cant mission derailment if lost. From 2014 to

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD —Extensions of RemarksE40 January 12, 2018 
2016, DHS purportedly lost 2,141 sensitive as-sets, including firearms, badges, and secure immigration stamps. In many of these cases, DHS personnel acted recklessly and were not held accountable for improperly safeguarding their sensitive assets. Furthermore, DHS per-sonnel often fail to track down their lost sen-sitive assets. H.R. 4433 will address this loose behavior by holding the Under Secretary of the DHS accountable for ensuring that sen-sitive assets are kept safe. I am particularly concerned with safe-guarding sensitive assets due to the increase in stolen guns within Georgia’s 4th district and the state as a whole. The Atlanta police chief recently reported that 954 guns were stolen from cars in Atlanta last year. This represents a 40 percent increase in the number of fire-arms stolen from cars compared to 2015. However, this is not just a Georgian prob-lem—a study by Harvard and Northeastern re-searchers this past year estimated that rough-ly 380,000 firearms are stolen in the U.S. every year. One of the best ways to address this issue is through prevention. By strength-ening the expectations and rules for firearm ownership within the DHS, we can do a small part to reduce the number of stolen guns in Georgia and across the country. As a member of the Judiciary committee, I have worked consistently to promote respon-sible gun ownership. I cosponsored legislation that required the review of U.S. policy regard-ing capture, custody, treatment, judicial pro-ceedings, and repatriation of suspected ‘un-lawful enemy combatants.’ With these past legislative actions in mind, I support H.R. 4433 and urge my fellow members to do the same.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, January 12, 2018 Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Speaker, deadly mudslides have destroyed homes and claimed at least seventeen lives in my district. These mudslides have devastated the communities in my district—many of which are still recovering from the horrific Thomas Fire. In order to be with my constituents and assist the community in recovery efforts, I decided to return to Santa Barbara, California. As a result, I missed votes on January 10, 2018 and January 11, 2018.

IN RECOGNITION OF FIRE CHIEF MIKE DUNCAN 
HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, January 12, 2018 Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the exemplary work of Fire Chief Mike Duncan in his service to the City of Roa-noke, Texas as we mark his retirement. Dur-ing his sixteen years as Fire Chief in Roa-noke, he has been a committed leader in his community. Chief Duncan was a seasoned fire fighter when he joined the Roanoke Fire Department as chief in 2001. He first began his firefighting career in 1974 with the City of North Richland Hills Fire Department. Since that time, he has served his community tirelessly in a variety of leadership roles. Throughout his years of service, Chief Dun-can earned certifications as a Master Fire-fighter, Advanced Fire Inspector, a Fire Serv-ice Instructor II and as the Department Head for the Fire Department. He is a leading mem-ber of the Denton County Fire Chiefs Associa-tion where he served as Treasurer for 11 years, the Tarrant County Fire Chiefs Associa-tion where he served as President in 2004, the International Association of Fire Chiefs, the National Fire Protection Association, the North East Fire Department Association and the International Code Conference. Chief Duncan has devoted 43 years to pro-tecting his neighbors. For more than four dec-ades, he has put strangers’ safety above his own, and we are indebted to him. I am deeply grateful for his service to the City of Roanoke and North Texas, and I wish Chief Duncan and his family the best in his retirement. f 
SCREENING AND VETTING PAS-SENGER EXCHANGE ACT OF 2017 
SPEECH OF  
HON. HENRY C. ‘‘HANK’’ JOHNSON, JR. 
OF GEORGIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, January 9, 2018 Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4581. H.R. 4581, the Screening and Vetting Pas-senger Exchange Act of 2017, requires the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to develop best practices for counter terrorism screening and vetting through the use of ad-vanced passenger information (API) and pas-senger name record (PNR) data. This bill also encourages the Secretary of DHS to share best practices and assist with implementation for our foreign partners. The DHS, U.S. Customs and Border Protec-tion (CBP), and the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) have all utilized API and PNR as tools for screening and vetting poten-tial criminals and terrorists. In April 2016, the European Union (EU) decided to follow in our footsteps by implementing PNR data into their counter terrorism screenings. The EU set a deadline for full integration of PNR data by May 2018. Unfortunately, many EU countries lack the knowledge, expertise, and experience with PNR data to allow them to meet their up-coming deadline. H.R. 4581 would allow the DHS to develop best practices for utilizing API and PNR data in counter terrorism screening and then share these best practices with our foreign allies. This legislation will strengthen our national security and that of our foreign partners. Since 9/11, we have prevented hundreds of acts of terror and improved our national security. However, in the last two years, the United States has experienced a surge in terrorist acts and criminal activities. As a former member of the House Armed Services Committee, I have always voted to support our law enforcement agencies in the work that they do. H.R. 4581 will fortify our Armed forces with best practices for pre-venting terrorism and allow them to continue doing their crucial work protecting our country. This legislation will also help our foreign allies so that they are able to effectively keep their people, and the people of the world, safe. Pro-tecting our national security and the national securities of our allies ought to be a given. For this reason, I support H.R. 4581 and urge my fellow members to do the same. f

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD —Extensions of RemarksE41 January 12, 2018 
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is the newest cabinet department in the United States federal government and was created in 2002 in the wake of the September 11th terrorist attacks. The department’s mis-sion is to prevent, prepare for, and respond to domestic issues, and it is deeply involved in border security and immigration services. In many ways, the DHS is still a fledgling cabinet department and H.R. 4567 aims to ensure transparency and accountability in this law en-forcement body, and to encourage interagency communication and collaboration in their shared mission to fight terrorism abroad. As a federal law enforcement agency, it’s important to establish oversight rules for the DHS. Government oversight is one of the pil-lars of the American democracy and is a vital part of promoting accountability among the powerful. This is even truer of personnel in countries outside of the United States, where agents can be operating far from a super-visor’s watchful eye. We, as one of the most powerful nations in the world, must police our international pres-ence to prevent abuses of power. As a former member of the Armed Services committee, I have long been a supporter of ethical prac-tices and even sponsored legislation to review the United States treatment of suspected ‘‘un-lawful enemy combatants’’. In our fight against terror worldwide, it’s important to make sure that we ourselves are upholding the inalien-able rights our democracy is founded upon. H.R. 4567 encourages communication and accountability within the DHS, and allows for transparency between this department and the legislative branch. I support H.R. 4567 and I urge my colleagues to do the same.

DOMESTIC EXPLOSIVES DETEC-TION CANINE CAPACITY BUILD-ING ACT OF 2017 
SPEECH OF  
HON. HENRY C. ‘‘HANK’’ JOHNSON, JR. 
OF GEORGIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, January 9, 2018 Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise to support H.R. 4577, the Domestic Explo-sives Detection Canine Capacity Building Act of 2017. This legislation directs the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to create a work group to explore best practices for developing a breeding and training program for explosive detection canines. This working group would also determine medical standards, behavioral standards, and training standards for the pro-gram. Currently in the United States, we rely heav-ily on explosive detection canines. They are a vital part of security measures not only at air-ports, but locations across the United States and the world. The sensitivity, complexity, and astuteness of a Bomb-sniffing dog’s nose sim-ply cannot be replicated with modern tech-nology, and they are some of our best assets in the fight to protect Americans from acts of terror. Previously, the TSA oversaw a breeding program to train and produce top quality serv-ice canines; however, that program was cut from the budget in 2012. This has forced the agency to purchase lower quality canines abroad at exorbitant prices. In 2017, the TSA oversaw a work force of 1,000 dogs and would need to acquire 350 annually to main-tain these numbers. A New York Times article detailing the problem noted that in one of the four trips TSA agents annually make less than half of the 110 dogs they might see pass pre-liminary screening requirements, and another 15 to 20 percent fail to complete the agency’s training program. To put it blandly, we are buying the best dogs our money can buy, and they’re not good enough. H.R. 4577 is the first step to rebuilding the TSA’s breeding program and ensuring that the dogs protecting our na-tion’s airports and travelers satisfy our stand-ards of excellence. This legislation will allow experts to not only determine which breeds are best suited for the job, but also which training methods are most effective. I am particularly concerned with this issue, because Georgia houses the busiest airport in the world. Atlanta’s Hartsfield Jackson airport in January of 2017 alone was visited by over 7.5 million passengers and played host to over 70,000 different aircrafts. Canines are widely used in the daily operations of this airport and a critical part of safety operations. Additionally, as a member of the Transpor-tation & Infrastructure committee, and a former member of the Armed Services committee I have long been concerned with issues relating to airport security and the safety of pas-sengers who travel through our country. The TSA is an agency filled with people who have dedicated their careers to protecting Ameri-cans and we must provide them with the best tools available to do so. Explosive detecting canines are a crucial piece of the front line protecting Americans from harm and a nec-essary part of ensuring that all passengers and aircrafts are protected from any threat. H.R. 4577 will ensure that the United States can develop a program that will produce ex-plosive detection canines that meet our stand-ards of excellence and will build a sustainable method for ensuring the program’s perma-nence. I support this legislation and I urge my colleagues to do the same.
