PRAYER 
Reverend Michael Wilker, Lutheran 
Church of the Reformation, Wash-ington, D.C., offered the following prayer: 
Spirit of truth and reconciliation, 
You created us in Your image to care for one another and the common good. Our Nation’s democracy intends to be one where we respect every resident 
and attend to those most vulnerable. 
But too often our political discourse 
divides us from our best selves. Too often we use religion to divide and jus-tify one group’s triumph over another. Save us from the tyranny of hate, greed, and the fear of our enemies. 
Renew our political engagement and 
cultivate generosity, patience, civility, and collegiality. Guide us to discern and honestly articulate our own deeply held values. Open our hearts to listen to and equally value our partners. 
Restore our commitment to demo-
cratic values and strengthen us to practice them skillfully. Help us con-tend and wrestle with the issues and not each other. 
Amen.

HONORING TOMIO MORIGUCHI 
HON. ADAM SMITH 
OF WASHINGTON  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, October 16, 2015 
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise to honor Tomio Moriguchi, a native of Ta-coma and longtime Seattle resident and com-munity icon, for his latest honor: the Dr. Sam-uel E. Kelly Award from the University of Washington’s Multicultural Alumni Partnership (MAP). This is a fitting recognition for Tomio’s extensive leadership and service in the com-munity over the course of decades. 
Tomio’s father, Fujimatsu Moriguchi, made a 
living selling rice to workers at logging and fishing camps in the Seattle area. The busi-ness—named Uwajimaya after the fishing vil-lage where Fujimatsu learned his trade—grew steadily until World War II, when Tomio and his family were placed in internment camps along with many Japanese-Americans. 
After the war, the Moriguchi family went 
back to work. Uwajimaya reopened and Tomio attended Garfield High School and the Univer-sity of Washington. Following his time in col-lege, Tomio enjoyed a brief stint at the Boeing Company as an engineer before joining the family business. Under his careful leadership for 30 years as CEO and in partnership with the many family members involved in the busi-ness, Uwajimaya experienced meteoric growth. Tomio guided the company through its massive expansion in the International District while adding locations in the Greater Seattle Area. Today, thanks to the careful guidance of Tomio and other family members, the com-pany now employs 500 people and is engrained in the social fabric of life in the Pa-cific Northwest. 
Outside of his business endeavors, Tomio 
has also made a life-long commitment to the betterment of his community. Tomio led the way for the development of the Keiro Nursing Home, a culturally-sensitive facility to serve the Japanese community in Seattle. He has served as President of the Hokebui Hochi Foundation, which organizes educational and cultural activities to preserve Japanese cul-ture. He also serves as publisher of the re-gion’s largest Japanese newspaper, the North American Post. Other highlights include his service on many non-profit boards and the creation of the International District Improve-ment Association. Throughout his life, Tomio has demonstrated a unique ability to serve as a unifying force and advocate for Asian Amer-ican communities in the region. 
Mr. Speaker, it is with great honor that I rec-
ognize Mr. Tomio Moriguchi for his years of service and the impact he has made within the Asian American community and countless oth-ers in the greater Seattle area. HONORING MS. MAKANI THEMBA 
HON. BARBARA LEE 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, October 16, 2015 
Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor 
Ms. Makani Themba for her extraordinary life work empowering historically marginalized communities. 
Ms. Themba’s activism spans numerous 
roles and she has a strong history of advo-cating and organizing in grassroots engage-ment alongside underserved people of color. 
For the past 14 years, Ms. Themba has 
served as the Executive Director for The Praxis Project, a nonprofit organization based in Washington D.C., which helps communities use media and policy advocacy to advance health justice. Under her leadership, The Praxis Project has raised more than $24 mil-lion dollars for advocacy organizations nation-wide. These initiatives include Communities Creating Healthy Environments (CCHE), a na-tional program of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF), which sets out to prevent childhood obesity by increasing access to healthy foods and safe places to play in com-munities of color. The program will advance RWJF’s efforts to reverse the childhood obe-sity epidemic by supporting diverse, commu-nity-based organizations and federally char-tered tribal nations in the development and im-plementation of effective, culturally responsive policy initiatives to address the root causes of 
childhood obesity. 
Prior to her tenure at The Praxis Project, 
Ms. Themba directed the Grass Roots Innova-tive Policy Program (GRIPP) a national project where she effectively engaged in media and policy advocacy to address institutional racism in welfare and public education. 
Ms. Themba has published numerous arti-
cles and case studies on race, class, media, policy advocacy and public health. She is the author of Making Policy, Making Change, and co-author of Media Advocacy and Public Health: Power for Prevention, a contributor to the volumes Community Based Participatory Research for Health, Prevention Is Primary: Strategies for Community Well Being, We the Media along with many other editorial projects. Her publications have helped set the standard for policy advocacy work and contributed sig-nificantly to the field’s current emphasis on media and policy advocacy to address health problems. Her latest book is a collaboration with The Praxis Project and includes contribu-tions from Malkia Cyril and others. It is titled, Fair Game: A Strategy Guide for Racial Jus-tice Communications in the Obama Era. 
Additionally, Ms. Themba has worked on 
international projects that build capacity among advocates to more effectively address structural racism. At Transnational Racial Jus-tice Initiative (TRJI), she leveraged tools and best practices from around the world and co- authored and edited a shadow report on insti-tutional racism and white privilege—the first of its kind. Ms. Themba has also helped initiate numer-
ous programs which have positively impacted communities facing national disasters. Through the Katrina Information Network, she connected more than 200,000 people dis-placed by the Katrina Hurricane to their fami-lies and friends through the use of informa-tional technology. 
On behalf of the residents of California’s 
13th Congressional District, I salute Ms. Makani Themba, and thank her for a lifetime of service.

RECOGNIZING THE FRIENDS OF 
INDIA MISSION 2015 
HON. ALBIO SIRES 
OF NEW JERSEY  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, October 16, 2015 
Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to rec-
ognize the upcoming Friends of India 2015 Mission. The Friends of India Mission focuses on fostering women’s business exchanges, economic empowerment, and gender parity while promoting meaningful, long-term dia-logue among business and professional women in both India and the United States. For a decade, these missions have spurred the sharing of knowledge, ideas, and best practices and continue to lay the foundation for women’s economic and political empower-ment initiatives in both societies. 
Mr. Speaker, this year’s delegation is quite 
unique. Twenty-two women, representing nine business sectors are committing themselves to expanding initiatives that promote gender im-pact investing, economic exchanges, and em-powerment opportunities; all while spurring trade between India and the United States. 
Since 2005, Daryl Rand, the Friends of 
India Mission Chair, has been leading these missions, providing unique opportunities for women to expand their professional relation-ships and represent American businesses abroad. To date, approximately 90 women have traveled as part of this group of Friends of India. 
I am proud that businesswomen from New 
Jersey’s 8th District continue to lead important missions from the United States to India. I am confident that this year’s mission will continue to promote strong business and personal rela-tionships between influential women in the Garden State and our friends in Mumbai.

HONORING HEROES DAY 
HON. RAU´L M. GRIJALVA 
OF ARIZONA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, October 16, 2015 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in 
honor of Southern Arizona’s annual Heroes Day celebration, an occasion where we pause to reflect on the brave law enforcement and

first responders who serve our state and put 
their lives at risk every day. For the seventh year, we recognize Southern Arizona’s heroes for their extraordinary responses to traumatic crises. 
Today, in the United States, more than 
900,000 law enforcement officers put their lives on the line for the safety and protection of others. They serve with valor and distinc-tion—and with great success. Every day, countless lives are saved and touched by first responder units. 
As a native of Tucson, Arizona, I am privi-
leged to know personally these incredibly cou-rageous and compassionate men and women. I have learned that being a first responder is not about what you do, it’s who you are. From Firefighter Adam Kroger, who worked with by-standers to lift the driver of a semi-tractor trail-er with lacerations and a compounded fracture out of his vehicle to safety, to Deputies Adrian Gallo and Joe Serrano, who risked their own safety to save a woman with life-threatening injuries after a head-on collision, today’s hon-orees are joined by an innate sense of service and duty. 
I wish to congratulate Heroes Day Winners 
Firefighter Adam Kroger from the Golder Ranch Fire District, Deputy Adrian Gallo and Deputy Joe Serrano from the Pima County Sheriff’s Department, Officer Robert ‘‘Bobby’’ Kelly and Stephanie Kelly, RN, from the Tuc-son Police Department, and Aaron Romero, Alexander Stewart, and Andrew Miles on this prestigious honor. I also congratulate Honor-able Mentions Jose Madrigal from CBP Tuc-
son Sector Border Patrol, Deputy Don Molchan from the Pima County Sheriff’s De-partment, and Firefighter Ryan Szach from the Golder Ranch Fire District. And finally, thank 
you to the local businesses and people of Ari-zona who take their time and energy to make this special day of recognition possible. 
The commemoration ceremony on October 
15, 2015 will be a day in which we acknowl-edge the history, achievements, contributions that first responders have made for Southern Arizona, and we are eternally grateful for their service to our community.

REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF SUE 
ANN WUEST 
HON. MARCY KAPTUR 
OF OHIO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, October 16, 2015 
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
remember the life of Sue Ann Wuest; a friend, an intellectual, and a valued member of our Toledo community. 
Sue was born in Oregon, Ohio on July 31, 
1956 to Joan and Howard Wuest. She was a graduate of Cardinal Stritch High School and earned her bachelor’s degree from the Univer-sity of Toledo. 
Sue went on to serve as the assistant direc-
tor of the Urban Affairs Center at the Univer-sity of Toledo for many years, where she worked to address challenges and find solu-tions in urban and regional development. 
Her interest in her community led her to 
serve as a Member of the Toledo Planning Commission, where she helped to guide land- use decisions to create a better community life and economic opportunity for Toledo resi-dents. During her time on the Toledo Planning 
Commission, the Commission voted unani-mously to allow the Toledo Museum of Art to begin construction of its $25 million Center for Glass museum building, of which she had said: ‘‘We have to demonstrate courage to build buildings that make a statement for our time.’’ 
Sue was an active resident of the historic 
Old West End neighborhood, where she often threw parties to celebrate the Old West End Festival. Her commitment to her community did not end there; she thrived on mentoring public officials and young professionals. 
In her spare time, she was an artist, draw-
ing, making beaded jewelry and hand painted silk scarves, among other things. Sue also en-joyed cooking for others. 
It seems as if Sue’s hallmark was to bring 
people together: among her family and friends, bring them together to celebrate a holiday or just to enjoy a dinner; at her work, where she sought out solutions with others to address the needs of the region; and in her community, where she dedicated her life to making the To-ledo area a better place for all of us to live. 
Sue will be remembered lovingly by her par-
ents, Joan and Howard Wuest and her sisters, Ann Simpkins and Amy Roman; and her brothers-in-law, nieces and nephews, and her many friends. We offer them our prayers and hope that they find comfort in the wonderful memories of our dear friend, Sue, who will be remembered with affection and gratitude for her probing intellect, kind heart, and utter dedication to advancing Toledo as a commu-nity, its people and its institutions.
