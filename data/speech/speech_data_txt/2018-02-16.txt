TRIBUTE TO JOHN REASONER 
HON. DAVID YOUNG 
OF IOWA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, February 16, 2018 Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate John Reasoner of Creston, Iowa for being named Creston Youth of the Year for 2017. John is the son of Mike and Margaret Reasoner. John has participated in numerous activities during his time at Creston Community High School. He has been active in choir, band, winter drumline, speech and musicals. He has also spent three years on the student body government and this year as the student body President. He credits his parents, family and some great teachers for his success as a stu-dent. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to represent community leaders like John in the United States Congress and it is with great pride that I recognize him today. I ask that my col-leagues in the United States House of Rep-resentatives join me in congratulating John for this outstanding recognition and in wishing him nothing but continued success.

COMMENDING MICHAEL THOMAS AND OTHER CITIZEN-ACTIVISTS DEVOTED TO PUBLIC SERVICE 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, February 16, 2018 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, with pride I rise to pay tribute to Michael Thomas, a multi-talented young man and professional football player, who is volunteering as an NFLPA extern in my office. Before he joined the Miami Dolphins in 2013 to bolster its secondary as a free safety, Mi-chael Thomas, who starred and attended Chester W. Nimitz High School in Houston, Texas, was rated the 75th best high school player in the nation by ESPN. Michael went on to collegiate stardom at Stanford University earning All-Pac-12 Honor-able-Mention after his senior year campaign with the Cardinal. Michael Thomas is one of those rare individ-uals who has a knack for making good things happen. In the very first game he played with the Miami Dolphins, Michael made the game-sav-ing play against the New England Patriots with an end-zone interception of the great Tom Brady. But what I find most exciting and inspiring about this winner is that Michael Thomas also earned his degree from Stanford University and continued his education by earning his MBA from the University of Miami Business School. Michael Thomas comes to my Washington office as an extern during the Second Session of the 115th Congress to get hands on experi-ence on how the legislative branch of the fed-eral government works. During his time in my office, Michael has made a difference by: Attending committee hearings, meetings, and briefings; Researching legislative proposals, advocacy documents, and policy analyses; Contributing to my Budget Committee work; and Drafting memoranda regarding important legislative priorities. Michael Thomas has observed and contrib-uted to the important legislative work that is performed every day in my office to advance a positive legislative agenda that puts children, families and the elderly first at the forefront of public policy initiatives and funding. Michael’s work in public service did not begin with his decision to become an extern, nor did it begin when he decided to take a knee in silent protest against a criminal justice system that too often appears to value some lives less than others. Michael Thomas is determined to make a difference in the world of professional sports and in society at large, which inspired him and other athletes to engage in next-step initiatives beyond ‘‘Taking A Knee.’’ Michael’s commitment to making the world just a little bit better is exemplified by his work on education reform in the city of Houston, as well as with the Miami Dolphins. Michael Thomas is a leader and public en-trepreneur in his own right. He proposed that the Miami Dolphins create a ‘‘Project Change Scholarship’’ through the Dolphins Foundation, which made its first award this year. Michael is now expanding this effort into a campaign to persuade every sports organiza-tion to adopt a similar scholarship program. Michael is challenging all athletes to take an internship or externship in the office of one of their local, state, or federal government elect-ed officials or agencies to gain a better appre-ciation for and understanding of the central im-portance of democratic norms, traditions, and institutions to democratic governance that is responsive, effective, innovative, and efficient. There are present and future citizen-activists in every community in America and as Mem-bers of Congress we should actively encour-age them to become and remain engaged in the important work of citizenship. I am reminded of this pearl of wisdom from Margaret Mead: ‘‘Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it’s the only thing that ever has.’’ I thank Michael Thomas for everything he is doing and has done to promote greater civic tolerance, understanding, inclusion and diver-sity, and commend him as an example and in-spiration to young people everywhere who are asking not what their country can do for them, but what they can do for their country. IN HONOR OF GARRET VICKERY AND NATHAN FAWCETT FOR EARNING THE EAGLE SCOUT AWARD HON. LIZ CHENEY 
OF WYOMING  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, February 16, 2018 Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to extend my congratulations to Garret Vickery and Nathan Fawcett on earning the Eagle Scout Award. Earning the rank of Eagle Scout requires fulfilling rigorous requirements and a dedica-tion to hard work. Throughout their time as part of Boy Scouts of America Wyoming Troop 145, Garret and Nathan have exhibited out-standing leadership abilities, service to their community, and outdoor skills that have made it apparent that they are deserving of this award. I commend their commitment to scout-ing, excellence, and higher education. I have no doubt the lessons they have learned throughout their time in the Boy Scouts will benefit them for many years to come. Again, Mr. Speaker, I would like to extend my congratulations to Garret Vickery and Na-than Fawcett for earning the Eagle Scout Award. Both them and their families deserve to be very proud of this significant honor and achievement.

TRIBUTE TO MAKAYLA M CMANN 
HON. DAVID YOUNG 
OF IOWA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, February 16, 2018 Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Makayla McMann. Makayla was recently named a win-ner of the Uncommon Students Award. The award is given through the Hoover Presi-dential Library-Museum in West Branch, Iowa. The Uncommon Student Award program an-nually identifies and honors up to 15 Iowa high school juniors who propose and accomplish a project of their own design. Makayla created and implemented a day camp in the small town of Villisca, Iowa. The camp ran for five weeks and served students in kindergarten through sixth grade. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to recognize Makayla for this award and I am proud to rep-resent her in the United States Congress. I ask that my colleagues in the United States House of Representatives join me in congratu-lating Makayla for receiving this outstanding award and in wishing her nothing but contin-ued success.

IN RECOGNITION OF HER SERVICE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE: MS. DONNA JIMENEZ 
HON. ALAN S. LOWENTHAL 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, February 16, 2018 Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Speaker, after twenty years of dedicated service to the American people as a staff member with the United States House of Representatives, Ms. Donna Jimenez will officially retire on February 28, 2018. Ms. Jimenez served with honor and distinc-tion as the longtime District Office Manager for Congressman David Dreier from 1997 to 2012, and as a Senior Constituent Services Representative for my office and the residents of California’s 47th District from 2013 until her retirement. During her time in the Legislative Branch, Ms. Jimenez served thousands of constituents of both Congressional districts, helping solve challenging cases with numerous federal de-partments and agencies. She demonstrated leadership and dedication in helping people navigate the federal bureaucracy, and derived great joy and satisfaction in serving those in most need of advocacy and assistance, among them including our nation’s veterans, seniors, the disabled, and those immigrants seeking a brighter future in America. In addition to her dedicated service to the American people, Ms. Jimenez further distin-guished herself by earning her Master of Pub-lic Administration degree with an emphasis in Immigration, from the University of LaVerne in 2002. It is with great pride and gratitude that I ex-tend my best wishes to Ms. Donna Jimenez upon her retirement from the United States House of Representatives.

TRIBUTE TO STUART FRIENDS CHURCH 
HON. DAVID YOUNG 
OF IOWA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, February 16, 2018 Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate a special Iowa church congregation from Stuart, Iowa. Stuart Friends Church recently celebrated the 140th anniversary of their congregation. In 1855, pioneers founded the first church in the Stuart community. A new building was built in 1877, named Stuart Meeting of Friends and is still in use today. The congregation supports missions locally and abroad, and welcomes all people. Mr. Speaker, I applaud and congratulate the members of Stuart Friends Church for their many years of faithful attendance and service to their community. I am proud to represent them in the United States Congress and I ask that my colleagues join me in congratulating Stuart Friends Church and wishing them all nothing but the best in the years to come. IN RECOGNITION OF GEORGE G. DODGE INTERMEDIATE SCHOOL HON. DAVID P. JOYCE 
OF OHIO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, February 16, 2018 Mr. JOYCE of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I would like to acknowledge an exceptional school in my district, the George G. Dodge Intermediate School in Twinsburg, which has been recog-nized by the Ohio Department of Education as an Ohio School to Watch and a National Forum School. An Ohio School to Watch is a school that exceeds in academic excellence, developmental responsiveness, social equity, and organizational structures and processes. Students who attend George G. Dodge Inter-mediate get one of the best hands-on edu-cation experiences in the nation. The teachers and administrators go above and beyond their normal duties to educate and influence young minds to succeed academically, socially, and in their future professions. There is no greater cause than educating the minds of the future. As a father, I know the amount of trust parents put into the hands of our educators. Knowing our school districts are exceeding in efforts for our children to succeed creates a closer, more positive community for the students, parents, and all involved in the surrounding neighbor-hoods. George G. Dodge Intermediate School’s mission is to create an environment of pride for one’s education while engaging with parents, administration, and fellow stu-dents to grow in civic engagement and extra-curricular activities. This recognition is all due to the hard work by George G. Dodge Inter-mediate School Principal Reggie Holland, his staff, Twinsburg City School District Super-intendent Kathi Powers, and Twinsburg City School District School Board members Matt Cellura, Rob Felber, Matt Curtis, Tina Davis, and Angela DeFabio. The dedication and lead-ership of these men and women is remarkable and unmatched. I am truly proud to have such a great education system in Ohio’s fourteenth district and congratulate George G. Dodge In-termediate School on this well-deserved dis-tinction.

TRIBUTE TO THE CITY OF COUNCIL BLUFFS, IOWA 
HON. DAVID YOUNG 
OF IOWA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, February 16, 2018 Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize and congratulate the City of Council Bluffs, Iowa for its selection for three awards by the Iowa Tourism Office and Travel Fed-eration of Iowa. Council Bluffs received the Outstanding Community Award, Outstanding Event Award, and the Outstanding Website Award. Council Bluffs received these distinctions for its accomplishments on a new promotional website, strong hotel occupancy, and success-fully attracting large meetings and sporting events to the city. The Council Bluffs Parks Department cited 45,000 attendees at special events during 2017. The Council Bluffs website, UnleashCB.com, had a triple-digit percentage increase in users, sessions, and page views. Mark Eckman, Executive Director of the Council Bluffs Convention and Visitors Bureau, said, ‘‘it’s definitely noteworthy when a community wins three awards. It speaks to the quality of our efforts.’’ Mr. Speaker, I applaud and congratulate the City of Council Bluffs for earning these awards. This community should be proud of receiving these outstanding awards. I ask that my colleagues in the United States House of Representatives join me in congratulating Council Bluffs for these accomplishments and in wishing this great Iowa community nothing but continued success. f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF DR. MILDRED FAY JEFFERSON 
HON. LOUIE GOHMERT 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, February 16, 2018 Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, we are blessed, in the First District of Texas, to have been home to a multitude of extraordinary in-dividuals who have made significant impacts upon not only the State of Texas and our na-tion, but the entire world. Today, we honor one of these extraordinary individuals from east Texas, the late Dr. Mildred Fay Jefferson. Dr. Jefferson was a young prodigy, raised in the town of Carthage, Texas. Her early edu-cation was completed before she reached the age of fifteen, graduating from Carthage Col-ored High School—later known as Turner High School—in 1943. The determined young woman obtained a Bachelor’s degree in Medicine from Texas College at the age of eighteen, and in 1947, she completed her Master’s degree in Biology from Tufts University. Dr. Jefferson then con-quered the odds and became the first African American woman to graduate with a Ph.D. from Harvard Medical School, in 1951. After becoming a medical doctor, Dr. Jeffer-son continued to make history with a long string of ‘‘firsts’’ for women—including being the first woman to serve on staff at Boston City Hospital, the first woman to be granted membership in the Boston Surgical Society, and the first female Surgeon General at Bos-ton University Medical Center. Dr. Jefferson married former Navy Lieuten-ant Shane Cunningham in 1961. After their di-vorce in 1978, Dr. Jefferson turned her life to activism, by establishing the Massachusetts Citizens for Life Council. It was a decision made by the American Medical Association in 1970, however, that ig-nited Dr. Jefferson’s passion to defend life. It was at this time that the American Medical As-sociation decided that they would allow mem-ber physicians, who performed abortions in states where this procedure was already al-lowed, to perform abortions and view them ethically. Viewing this decision as the aban-donment of the Hippocratic Oath to ‘‘do no harm,’’ Dr. Jefferson began a nationwide out-cry against abortion. Dr. Jefferson helped form the Value of Life Committee which was one of the organizations that initiated the national ‘‘right-to-life’’ move-ment which endures to this day. She quickly became one of the most sought after and fer-vent spokespersons in the nation to represent the pro-life stance. In 1981, Dr. Jefferson testi-fied before Congress as a result of the historic 1973 Supreme Court case, Roe v. Wade.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD —Extensions of RemarksE201 February 16, 2018 
Dr. Jefferson was quoted as saying, ‘‘I be-came a physician in order to save lives, not to destroy them.’’ She also said, ‘‘I am not willing to stand aside and allow this concept of ex-pendable human lives to turn this great land of ours into just another exclusive reservation where only the perfect, the privileged, and the planned have the right to live.’’ The National Right to Life Committee (NRLC) was co-founded by Dr. Jefferson in 1973. She then entered the world of politics, running for the U.S. Senate from Massachu-setts in 1982, 1990, and 1994. Dr. Jefferson was honored with twenty-eight honorary degrees from numerous universities and colleges. Although Dr. Jefferson passed away at the age of eighty-four on October 15, 2010, her life’s mission continues today. She will be forever remembered as one of the most notable and unwavering crusaders for the rights of unborn children. It is truly a distinct privilege to honor this re-markable woman, whose exceptional life, steadfast devotion, and landmark accomplish-ments are included in the R
ECORD , which will endure as long as there is a United States of America.

HONORING LT. MARK A. RUSSO ON HIS RETIREMENT 
HON. BILL HUIZENGA 
OF MICHIGAN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, February 16, 2018 Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate, Lieutenant Mark Russo on his retirement from the Michigan State Police. As a graduate of the 101st Trooper recruit school in 1987, Trooper Mark Russo went on to serve at the Ithaca Post, Criminal Investiga-tion Division, and the Lansing Post. He was promoted to Sergeant in 1994 at the Ionia Post and in 1998 transferred to a multijuris-dictional narcotics unit, the Metropolitan En-forcement Team. He served on that team for 14 years before being promoted to a Lieuten-ant within the Emergency Management and Homeland Security Division. During his distinguished career, Lt. Russo received multiple awards including the Sixth District Gerstacker Award, the Grand Rapids Police Chiefs Award, and the International Narcotics Interdiction Association Group of the Year Award. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the Second Dis-trict of Michigan, we thank Lt. Mark Russo and his wife Tracy for their 31 years of service to West Michigan and to our nation.

HONORING RICHARD KUNDE 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, February 16, 2018 Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Richard Kunde, who worked tirelessly to establish Sonoma County as a world-renowned wine community and food destination. Mr. Kunde was born on September 6, 1942 in Glen Ellen, California and grew up on the ranch that his German immigrant grandfather founded in 1904. He graduated from the Uni-versity of California, Davis in 1964 with a bachelor’s degree in viticulture and went on to earn a master’s degree in horticulture in 1966. Mr. Kunde worked as a viticultural consult-ant and then Director of Grower Relations for the North Coast Grape Growers Association before purchasing Sonoma Grapevine Inc. in 1982. He transformed the Santa Rosa nursery into the largest grapevine nursery in the United States. At its height, the nursery pro-duced as many as 14 million vines every year, which were planted at vineyards across Cali-fornia. Over his half-century career, Mr. Kunde pro-moted the California wine community in many ways. He co-founded the Sonoma County Grape Growers and was elected to serve as its first president in 1984. He also served as a Director and President of the Sonoma Coun-ty Harvest Fair and held offices in the Cali-fornia Nurserymens Association and the Cali-fornia Association of Winegrape Growers. And, Mr. Kunde was the first to promote the concept of American Viticultural Areas within the region believing it was important to protect the quality and value of Sonoma County grapes. Mr. Kunde dedicated himself to the scientific development of California’s wine community. He collaborated with the leading viticulturists, pathologists and entomologists at UC Davis to improve the quality and profitability of Cali-fornia wine grapes. Together, they grafted clo-nal budwood to produce superior grapes and created rootstock resistant to phylloxera, which strengthened the viability of our local and state wine communities, and beyond. To spread these new techniques, Mr. Kunde co- founded the Sonoma County Technical Group, which taught growers about the latest grape production research. Mr. Kunde was a celebrated philanthropist who, with his late wife Saralee McClelland Kunde, generously donated their time, money and energy to agricultural causes. The couple raised millions of dollars for agricultural edu-cation programs like 4–H, Future Farmers of America, and the Sonoma County Fair Foun-dation at an event space they built them-selves, Richard’s Grove and Saralee’s Vine-yard. In addition, the Kundes established a chari-table trust to provide millions of dollars for ag-ricultural education in years to come. Through the trust, the University of California, Davis re-ceived $1.5 million for an endowed chair in the Department of Viticulture and Enology. An-other beneficiary, the Sonoma County Fair Foundation received $1 million to establish the Saralee and Richard Kunde Education Fund, which will provide young people interested in agricultural careers paid internships at local dairies, farms, vineyards and wool-growing op-erations. Finally, the Youth Ag and Leadership Foundation of Sonoma County received $500,000 to foster the next generation of farm-ers and community leaders. On July 26, 2016, a grateful community came together to dedicate Saralee and Rich-ard’s Barn, a 12,000 square-foot facility that now hosts agricultural mentoring, training and education programs year-round for at-risk and other youth. The barn, Saralee’s dream project, was seeded with a $300,000 donation from Mr. Kunde. The Sonoma community came together to raise the rest of the $3 mil-lion construction cost. For all his efforts, Mr. Kunde received countless awards. He was named a Friend of Agriculture by the Sonoma County Harvest Fair, was inducted into the Sonoma County Farm Bureau Hall of Fame, won the Shining Star Award from the 4–H Foundation, and was recognized for Leadership in Agriculture by the Santa Rosa Chamber of Commerce. Of his many honors, Mr. Kunde was especially proud to have been named one of the 100 most in-fluential Sonoma County people of the 20th Century by the Santa Rosa Press Democrat in 1999 and to have received the Award of Dis-tinction from the University of California, Davis’s College of Agricultural and Environ-mental Sciences in 2008. Mr. Speaker, Richard Kunde is an icon in the national wine community, and I am proud to have called him my friend. It is therefore fit-ting and proper that we remember him here today.

RECOGNITION OF 150TH ANNIVER-SARY OF THE BENEVOLENT AND PROTECTIVE ORDER OF ELKS 
HON. DAVID P. ROE 
OF TENNESSEE  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, February 16, 2018 Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 150th anniversary of the founding of the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks. As Chairman of the House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, it is both a pleasure and an honor for me to commemorate such an enor-mous milestone for an organization that does so much for America’s veterans. Founded by a small group of friends in New York City on February 16, 1868, the Benevo-lent and Protective Order of Elks is an Amer-ican fraternal society committed to the virtues of charity, justice, brotherly love and fidelity. Over the past 150 years, the Order has grown to include nearly 1,000,000 Elks Members and 2,000 lodges across the country. The Elks have a long and storied history of supporting America’s veterans. This is evident through the century-old Elks pledge: ‘‘So long as there are veterans, the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks will never forget them.’’ In fact, during World War I, at the behest of General Pershing—who was an Elk, himself— the Order donated over $2,000,000 to assist U.S. soldiers going abroad; and organized, constructed and equipped the first two Amer-ican field hospitals in France. Following World War I, the Elks empowered nearly 50,000 disabled veterans by providing rehabilitation, vocation and education loans. It was this act of generosity that prompted the federal government to offer the first ever G.I. Bill for education benefits. Every day, Elks across the country visit VA medical facilities to provide support and friend-ship to the men and women who have borne the battle for our freedoms. Last year alone, the Elks provided over 1,000,000 hours of service to veterans and donated nearly $41,000,000 worth of goods, supplies and cash in support of America’s veterans. Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned before, it is an absolute honor for me to commemorate the 150th anniversary of this incredible and self-less organization, the Benevolent and Protec-tive Order of Elks. I would like to extend my most sincere gratitude for their work over the past 150 years and I wish them the absolute best for 150 years to come.

RECOGNIZING HEATHER PHILLIPS, TEACHER OF THE YEAR FOR OKALOOSA COUNTY SCHOOL DIS-TRICT 
HON. MATT GAETZ 
OF FLORIDA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, February 16, 2018 Mr. GAETZ. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize Heather Phillips, the Teacher of the Year for Okaloosa County School District. For many years, Ms. Phillips has served the Okaloosa County School District with excep-tional enthusiasm and an unwavering commit-ment to excellence. Ms. Phillips is a fourth-grade teacher at Bluewater Elementary School in Niceville, FL. Even though she has taught for 15 years, she feels like she is just getting started. Ms. Phillips finds the greatest inspiration from her faith in God and the support of her family. She loves seeing the world through the eyes of children and allowing their energy to influence her focus on what truly matters. Her teaching experiences in Japan and Hong Kong help her appreciate diversity. She is also an active member of her church in Niceville and enjoys being part of the commu-nity where she teaches. Ms. Phillips believes being an educator is never predictable, and she thrives on the ever-changing nature of her profession. Ms. Phillips’ many skills and wonderful char-acter truly make her an invaluable and greatly appreciated resource. For all these reasons and more, she has been selected as the 2018 Okaloosa County School District Teacher of the Year. She is honored to represent Bluewater Ele-mentary and humbled to be considered among such an immensely talented group of edu-cators.

HONORING THE LIFE OF MARGARET FAYE SCHMITTOU 
HON. JODY B. HICE 
OF GEORGIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, February 16, 2018 Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Mrs. Margaret Faye Schmittou, one of the first female Ma-rines to serve our Nation and who recently joined our Heavenly Father at the age of 96. Mr. Speaker, known by most as Faye, Mrs. Schmittou was a WWII veteran who proudly answered the call of duty when the Marine Corps first opened to women in 1944 and de-voted more than 27 years of service to the Navy Exchange. Mr. Speaker, in addition to her outstanding service to our military, she also set an exam-ple of service to her children and grand-children and was described as a person who ‘‘would give you the shirt off her back.’’ She is survived by two granddaughters and a great granddaughter and will be remembered as a guiding force in the community through her work with the Athens Detachment in Georgia’s 10th District and Helping Hands in Colbert, GA. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing her remarkable legacy of serv-ice and unyielding commitment to our great Nation. f 
TRIBUTE TO MYCALE DOWNEY 
HON. DAVID YOUNG 
OF IOWA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, February 16, 2018 Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Mycale Downey of Creston, Iowa for being named Creston Citizen of the Year for 2017. Ms. Downey has served as Creston Animal Rescue Effort’s lead volunteer since the orga-nization was founded in 1998. She and the other volunteers in the group serve the com-munity by caring for animals at the city pound. They also coordinate veterinary care and work diligently to find new homes for each of the animals. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to represent community leaders like Mycale in the United States Congress and it is with great pride that I recognize her today. I ask that my col-leagues in the United States House of Rep-resentatives join me in congratulating Mycale for this outstanding recognition and in wishing her nothing but continued success.

TRIBUTE TO RAY BAUM 
HON. BEN RAY LUJA´N 
OF NEW MEXICO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, February 16, 2018 Mr. BEN RAY LUJA´N of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I was deeply saddened to learn of Ray Baum’s passing. Ray was a consummate professional—a true gentleman, whose de-cency and graciousness showed through in everything he did. He brought decades of expertise and a depth of knowledge to his role as Majority Staff Director of the House Energy and Com-merce Committee partly due to his prior serv-ice as member of the Oregon State Legisla-ture. Ray was also a dear friend, who I was proud to work with when we both served as public utility commissioners for our respective states of Oregon and New Mexico. But more than that, Ray was a kind, brilliant, patient, and dedicated public servant. He will be deeply missed by Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle and his

IN HONOR OF GINNY STEESE RICHARDSON 
HON. MIKE KELLY 
OF PENNSYLVANIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, February 16, 2018 Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, today it is my distinct honor to recognize the dedicated career and community service of my constituent and dear friend, Ginny Steese Richardson of Mercer County, upon her retire-ment as the Treasurer of Mercer County, Pennsylvania. Ginny served the residents of Mercer County as Treasurer for 23 years, from 1994 until 2017. Ginny has lived a lifetime of service to oth-ers. Her volunteer service and commitment to improving Mercer County and the great Com-monwealth of Pennsylvania began as a young girl growing up on a farm in Grove City, where she learned the value of a hard day’s work and the importance of keeping one’s word. Over the year’s Ginny has been a member of the Mercer County Pomona Grange, the Lon-don Grange #1492, the Grove City Sports-men’s Club, the Grove City Kiwanis, the Grove City Chamber of Commerce Board of Direc-tors, and the Daughters of the American Rev-olution. One of Ginny’s most valuable contributions to the Mercer County community has been her and her family’s lifelong commitment to the Mercer County Grange Fair, where she has served as the secretary of the Fair Board for the last 30 years and has also served as the past chairman. Ginny has also served as the treasurer of the Mercer County Farm Tour. In addition to her commitment to the busi-ness and agricultural communities of Mercer County, Ginny has served as the past sec-retary of the Mercer County Republican Party and is currently serving as the party Chair-man. In this capacity, Ginny has helped many candidates on their path to victory with wise words of counsel. While serving as the Mercer County Treas-urer, Ginny was very active in the Pennsyl-vania State Treasurer’s Association and was chosen by her peers to serve as the president of this organization. During her tenure she also served on the Dog Law Advisory Board. I wish Ginny great success and happiness in her well-deserved retirement. I join her en-tire community in thanking her for her years of service.

TRIBUTE IN HONOR OF THE LIFE AND MEMORY OF LYNDA CATH-ERINE M
CDOUGALD 
HON. JOSEPH CROWLEY 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, February 16, 2018 Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the life and service of Lynda Catherine McDougald, Lynda passed on De-cember 25, 2017 at the age of 67, after a life-time of dedication to the East Elmhurst and Corona communities of Queens. Lynda’s duti-ful efforts in Queens through her leadership positions at civic organizations of all kinds made her a role model and an inspiration to those around her, as well as a model citizen who represents the very best of what it means to be a member of our community. Lynda’s experiences as an activist began in 1963 when her parents took her to the March on Washington, and soon after she participated in the first New York City Board of Education Sit- in. Thus, Lynda understood early in her life the power of community organization as an effec-tive tool for bringing about real and righteous change. In 1978 Lynda became one of the very first members of the Curtis Street Block Associa-tion, where she would eventually serve mul-tiple terms as the association’s president. Lynda also served several terms as president of both the East Elmhurst-Corona Civic Asso-ciation and the Frederick Douglass Democratic Association. In addition to leading these influ-ential groups during her life, Lynda was also an executive board member on the Commu-nity Planning Board #3 as well as the Jerome Hardeman Sr. Child Care Center board. Lynda was a participant of the 115th Precinct Coun-cil, a member of the Corona-East Elmhurst N.A.A.C.P. chapter, and a member of the Val-ley Brook Community Church Married Couples Ministry. Lynda was well known for her work within the Couples Ministry at the Antioch Baptist Church of Corona along with her hus-band of 40 years, Thomas McDougald. Lynda grew up on 104th Street between Northern Boulevard and 32nd Avenue and began working at the age of 18 at the Equi-table. She continued to work tirelessly in addi-tion to her community involvements and finally retired in late 2016 from her position of Parent Coordinator at Thurgood Marshall High School. Lynda was perfectly suited for the po-sition of Parent Coordinator, a job she per-formed with great care and love. With her abundant warmth and kindness, it is no sur-prise that she collected lifelong friends every-where she went. When Lynda and Thomas physically left the Queens community in 2016, moving to Laurel, Maryland to be closer to their children, there can be no doubt that our community lost an immense force for positive civic engagement. Unsurprisingly, within a year of living in Laurel Lynda was already attending local political and civic events and looking for ways to move for-ward in her commitment to public service, al-though accolades never factored into the rea-sons Lynda worked on behalf of those around her. Lynda is survived by her husband, Thomas; daughters Alicia and Jennifer; son, Ruxton; granddaughter Aria; Son-in-law, Kenton; sis-ters Adrienne and Vivienne; nieces Larinda and Janeene; nephews Evan, Conrad, Marlon, Coby, and Keemen. Lynda was a woman of elegance, grace, joy, hope, charity, love, and action. Mr. Speaker, Lynda’s lifelong commit-ment to serving her community and loving her family and so many friends was, and should continue to be, an inspiration to all of us. I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the life and legacy of Lynda C. McDougald. May she rest in peace. TRIBUTE TO GLORIA JEAN AND GLENN BRENNAN HON. DAVID YOUNG 
OF IOWA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, February 16, 2018 Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Gloria Jean and Glenn Brennan of Council Bluffs, Iowa on the very special occasion of their 50th wedding anniversary. They celebrated their anniversary on December 2, 2017. Gloria Jean and Glenn’s lifelong commit-ment to each other and their family truly em-bodies Iowa values. As they reflect on their 50th anniversary, may their commitment grow even stronger, as they continue to love, cher-ish, and honor one another for many years to come. Mr. Speaker, I commend this great couple on their 50th year together and I wish them many more. I ask that my colleagues in the United States House of Representatives join me in congratulating them on this momentous occasion.

RECOGNIZING RICKY LE 
HON. ERIC SWALWELL 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, February 16, 2018 Mr. SWALWELL of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ricky Le, who just concluded over five years as my chief of staff. Ricky’s story is truly an inspirational and American one. He was just four years old when his family fled communist Vietnam as refugees in a raft and came to the United States, seeking freedom and opportunity. Ricky grew up in San Jose, California, raised by his parents Tan Xuan Le and Kim Phi Luu. With the help of a local mentor, he was the first in his family to go to college. With the help of scholarships and grants, he grad-uated from the University of California, Santa Cruz. As someone appreciative of the opportu-nities he was offered by our country, Ricky has devoted his career to public service. He began by serving as an intern for my California colleague, Congresswoman Z
OE L
OFGREN , before assuming the role of sched-uler and staff assistant. Following a break to earn a law degree from Santa Clara University School of Law, Ricky went back to Congress-woman L
OFGREN ’Soffice as a policy advisor and eventually deputy chief of staff. He also worked for her on the House Administration Committee and as executive director of the California Democratic Congressional Delega-tion. His wealth of congressional experience, knowledge of California, and policy expertise is why I was grateful when Ricky agreed to be my chief of staff when I was first elected to Congress in 2012. He is believed to be the first Vietnamese American congressional chief of staff and has served as a mentor to dozens of congressional staffers from the Asian Amer-ican and Pacific Islander community. Ricky did a remarkable job in setting up my office. He assembled a great team, provided able counsel to me on the inner-workings of the House, and strived tirelessly to

help fulfill my vision of bringing new energy and ideas to Congress. For over five years Ricky has continued that great work. Day or night he has always been there to see that I am doing the best job I can to represent the East Bay. The residents of the Fifteenth Congressional District and I will be forever indebted for his service. On a personal level, I have come to deeply value Ricky’s friendship. My staff and I will truly miss his presence in our office. I know I speak for all of us as I wish Ricky all the best as he takes on his next challenge.
