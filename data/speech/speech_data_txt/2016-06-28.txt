PRAYER The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-fered the following prayer: Let us pray. Eternal God, the center of our joy, we lift our eyes to You. In a world with change and decay, You are changeless. Your presence makes us glad, and Your peace guards our hearts. Lord, today keep the eyes of our law-makers focused on You. May they look to You in their going out and coming in, in their rising up and lying down. May they see You in their labor and leisure and in their pleasure and sor-row. Guide them in life’s morning and evening, for the kingdom, power, and glory belong to You. Give them the wisdom to seize this day, working cre-atively to keep America strong. We pray in Your majestic Name. Amen.

ZIKA VIRUS AND VA–MILCON FUNDING BILL Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, we all heard Democrats warn that we ‘‘cannot delay any longer’’ on Zika control funding. We have heard them warn that ‘‘every day we wait is in-creasing the risk that we will have problems with Zika.’’ We have even heard them warn that ‘‘the mosquitoes are not going to be on recess.’’ But now, as we are about to vote on a bi-cameral compromise that reflects the $1.1 billion funding level that Demo-crats already unanimously supported here in the Senate, they are threat-ening to block the Zika control money. The Democratic leader yesterday went so far as to say that his Members ‘‘have no choice’’ but to oppose it. He and our friends across the aisle can try to come up with a line of excuses as to why they are blocking funding to ad-dress the Zika crisis and blocking sup-port for our Nation’s veterans, but here is what it all boils down to: This is par-tisan politics. They might like to pretend this Zika control measure is ‘‘woefully inad-equate,’’ but Senate Democrats are all on the record supporting this level of funding, and the CDC Director has tes-tified that this $1.1 billion funding level is sufficient ‘‘to do the things we need to do in the immediate term.’’ That is the head of the CDC. They might like to pretend that the Zika control measure walks back clean water protections, but that is false too. It actually contains a temporary, tar-geted compromise to promote mos-quito control as long-term solutions like a vaccine are being developed. They might want to dust off the ‘‘war on women’’ playbook, too, but this Zika control measure actually provides more resources for women’s health services through community health centers, public health departments, and hospitals. It is really puzzling to hear Demo-crats claim to be advocates for wom-en’s health measures when they are the ones trying to block this Zika legisla-tion and its critical resources to pro-tect women’s health. The CDC has said: ‘‘Zika virus infection during pregnancy can cause a serious defect called microcephaly, as well as other severe fetal brain defects.’’ So today Democrats have a choice: Continue pushing thinly veiled par-tisan arguments and block the Zika control funding or join with us to ad-vance a serious solution and send crit-ical funding to the President’s desk right now. Remember, this legislation is the last chance we have to get Zika control funding to the President’s desk for weeks. We should pass it to protect those especially at risk—pregnant women and babies. We should pass it to help prevent the spread of Zika and other mosquito-borne illnesses. We should pass it to help keep Americans safer from this public health concern in the midst of mosquito season. We know that blocking this bill would mean preventing critical anti- Zika funds from moving one step closer to becoming law. But here is what else it would mean: blocking critical fund-ing for our veterans, our servicemem-bers, and their families. These men and women voluntarily serve in our Armed

Forces in order to protect our country and our freedom. They don’t ask for much, but we ask so much of them. That is why we must meet our com-mitment to them by passing this Vet-erans and Military Construction fund-ing measure as soon as possible. This bill will increase critical resources to help ensure veterans receive health care and the health benefits they rely on. It will improve quality of life on military bases for soldiers, sailors, air-men, marines, and their families. It will support critical national security projects such as missile defense. It is a bipartisan measure that earned the support of both Democrats and Repub-licans when it passed the Senate. So let’s work together today and pass it again.

ZIKA VIRUS AND VA–MILCON FUNDING BILL Mr. REID. Mr. President, I don’t know what planet my friend the Re-publican leader is living on. This con-ference report is the most irresponsible legislation I have ever seen in my 34 years in Congress. That says a lot. I can’t think of anything that is close. This Zika threat is real. It is serious. Every day more and more Americans are being infected. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-vention, right now 2,900 Americans have already contracted Zika. There were 700 just last week alone who were added to that list. It was 2,200, and now it is 2,900, and 481 women have been tested positive for the virus in the United States. Eight pregnancies in the United States have resulted in severe birth defects because of Zika, and when we talk about severe birth defects, we mean it. They have little shrunken heads and their skulls are caved in. Mosquitoes have caused problems for-ever, but never like this. In spite of all the evidence of Zika’s harm to the American people, Repub-licans are pushing the conference re-port as nothing more than the goodie bag for the fringes of the Republican Party. In April, very recently, the Re-publican leader told reporters: 
We are all very much aware that this is a serious crisis. . . . We’ll be working with the administration, with the Democrats. 
That simply hasn’t proven to be true. On the conference committee the Democrats were locked out of negotia-tions. Then they jammed through this bill. When I say in the middle of the night, it was in the middle of the night. It was during the time they had the sit-in on the House floor. Chaos was there. There was no debate, no discus-sion. It was just ruled there by the Pre-siding Officer. It shortchanged the President’s request by $800 million. It took another $100 million from the Ebola funding, which is badly needed. All you have to do is talk to anyone at NIH or the Centers for Disease Control, and they will tell you. Ebola is not gone. Then they proceeded. I don’t know if they sat in a room and said: Let’s do everything we can just to hit every constituency group the American peo-ple like, and let’s just poke in their eyes. That is what they did. How about women’s health? How anti-women’s health can they make it? I will tell you that we are dealing here with pregnant women and women who want some type of birth control. The Republican conference report restricts funding for birth control provided by Planned Parenthood. My friend says they can go someplace else for it. In America today, there are huge seg-ments of the American people where this is the only place they can go for help. Women need Planned Parenthood, and what do the Republicans do be-cause of their fixation on doing every-thing they can to hurt Planned Parent-hood? They do these phony television interviews. They have fake cameras. The courts have decided that what they did is wrong. They have been sued, but that is OK. Anything they can do to whack Planned Parenthood, they are going to do it, and they tried it here. How about ObamaCare? They have tried to revoke it almost 70 times, and it didn’t work. So what do they do? They just rescind $543 million dollars and stick it in the conference report. I guess that was just to get the Presi-dent’s attention. Of course he is going to veto this, but they wanted to make sure he was going to have something really substantive in order to do it. How about the environment? Remem-ber that what we are trying to—in ad-dition to all of the things we have talked about—is that we want to make sure there is a way of getting rid of these pests—these mosquitoes. How do they do that? The only way we have found that is really effective is with spraying to kill these little varmints, these insects. Well, what do the Repub-licans do? They exempt pesticide spraying from the Clean Water Act. Why? Just because they don’t like the EPA. They don’t like the Clean Water Act. It has been around for 60 years, and they still don’t like it. How about this? We know the Demo-crats have a big constituency with vet-erans. Why not whack them? OK. Let’s do that. What we will do is take $500 million out of veterans health. That should get the Democrats’ attention. They couldn’t stop themselves from coming up with every idea. I guess they were waiting around while the chaos was happening on the House floor, say-ing: Can we think of anything else that would just be really good to do? I have it. Why don’t we rescind the order that is in effect saying you can’t fly the Confederate flag on military cemeteries? Great idea—OK, I am glad you came up with that. We are going to stick that in there too. Under this legislation the Repub-licans stuck in there a line to prohibit the legislation that says you can’t fly a Confederate flag in a military ceme-tery. Under their legislation, you can go ahead and do it. This conference report is disgraceful. It is shameful to use a real-life public health crisis to push the radical Repub-lican agenda. It is radical. I have told you what they are doing. There is a point of order against the bill also. We could raise that. Republicans were eager to inject pol-itics in this legislation, even rescind-ing $543 million from the Affordable Care Act, making the bill rescindable. For these and other reasons, we are going to vote against cloture. But it is not just Democrats saying this bill is a disaster. No, don’t leave it to us. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the RECORD a letter from 40 public health care groups, including some of these radical organizations like the March of Dimes, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Obstetricians and Gyne-cologists, Easterseals, the American Public Health Association, and 35 more.

Let us be clear: Zika is a public health emergency. It is increasingly likely that pregnant women in the U.S. will be infected with Zika this summer and give birth to in-fants with devastating, preventable birth de-fects next year. The conference committee should recon-vene immediately to craft a new bill that: Provides appropriate funding levels for all aspects of Zika response, including contra-ception for women who wish to avoid preg-nancy, and to prevent the sexual trans-mission of Zika; Does not draw funds from other important public health priorities, including Ebola ef-forts; Does not place unreasonable restrictions on Zika funding, which would hinder the ability of agencies to respond to the virus given that its course is unpredictable; Lays a foundation with FY2016 funding that can be built upon responsibly in subse-quent fiscal years, since Zika will be a long- term challenge; and

Is capable of garnering bipartisan support. The fact that it is already almost July and Congress has failed to act would seem to re-flect an appalling indifference to the lives of infants and their families. Our nation is per-ilously close to the point where it will be im-possible to distribute funding to states and localities in order to make a meaningful dif-ference this year. Many at-risk jurisdictions have been forced to lay off trained staff due to cuts and the lack of new resources, even as they are being asked to battle this new threat. Additional resources are needed im-mediately to protect pregnant women and their infants from Zika and life-altering birth defects. CDC Director Tom Frieden has stated that the estimated cost of care for a baby with the severe microcephaly caused by the Zika virus could be up to $10 million per child. If 100 babies are born with this severe form of microcephaly caused by Zika, their care will cost the U.S. economy approximately $1 bil-lion—roughly the cost of the bipartisan package passed by the Senate. If the inaction in Congress persists, the U.S. and its terri-tories could easily see dozens or even hun-dreds of infants born with preventable microcephaly, an outcome that would be not only a human tragedy but a significant eco-nomic burden. Once again, we urge you in the strongest possible terms to reconvene the conference committee to produce a responsible Zika funding bill that can pass Congress as quick-ly as possible. If this does not take place, Congress will bear the full responsibility for Zika-related birth defects across the nation in the coming years.

Mr. REID. These organizations are blasting this Republican conference re-port because they want real legislation to fund Zika. They call on Congress to pass a bill that ‘‘provides appropriate funding levels for all aspects of Zika response, including contraception for women who wish to avoid pregnancy, and to prevent the sexual transmission of Zika.’’ They want a bill that ‘‘does not draw funds from other important public health priorities, including Ebola ef-forts.’’ They want a bill that ‘‘does not place unreasonable restrictions on Zika fund-ing, which would hinder the ability of agencies to respond to the virus given that its course is unpredictable.’’ They want a bill that ‘‘lays a founda-tion with FY2016 funding that can be built upon responsibly in subsequent fiscal years, since Zika will be a long- term challenge; and is capable of gar-nering bipartisan support.’’ The letter continues: ‘‘The fact that it is already almost July and Congress has failed to act would seem to reflect an appalling indifference to the lives of infants and their families.’’ These are not Democrats saying this, these are these public health organiza-tions. They are aghast at what Repub-licans are doing. Instead of accepting their bill is a failure that is going nowhere, Repub-licans are making these threats. Yes-terday the assistant Republican leader came to the floor and said Republicans are going to abandon Zika funding ne-gotiations after this vote. The Repub-lican Senate is on pace to work the fewest days the Senate has worked in more than 60 years. Sixty years ago, the country was much smaller. There was a lot less people and a lot less busi-ness, but even with that, we are work-ing less than they did 60 years ago. In 2 weeks, the Senate plans to leave Washington for 7 weeks, which is the longest summer recess since we can re-member. Is it too much to ask Repub-licans to work until we have done our job in giving States and territories the resources they need to fight Zika and protect women? Public health organi-zations don’t think so and we don’t ei-ther. Republicans need to get serious about sending President Obama the full $1.9 billion that doctors, researchers, nurses, and public health experts say is needed to fight Zika. Every moment Republicans delay, there are other cases of Zika in innocent women, which affects their children more than one can imagine. Mr. President, will the Chair please announce the business of the day. f

TRANSPORTATION, HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, AND RE-LATED AGENCIES APPROPRIA-TIONS ACT, 2016—CONFERENCE REPORT The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will re-sume consideration of the conference report to accompany H.R. 2577, which the clerk will report. The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: Conference report to accompany H.R. 2577, a bill making appropriations for the Depart-ments of Transportation, and Housing and Urban Development, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2016, and for other purposes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until the vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the conference report will be equal-ly divided between the two leaders or their designees. The Senator from New York. Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise because I want to share a few words on the Zika component of the conference report on the MILCON–VA appropria-tions bill, which will be on the floor shortly. Unfortunately, but maybe not sur-prisingly, my friends on the other side of the aisle very well bowed down to their friends on the hard right and rid-dled this bill on Zika with poison pill provisions. If there was ever a bill de-signed to fail, it is what the Repub-licans have put together on Zika today. This bill is not only going to fail, it was designed to fail from the very be-ginning. Democrats have pushed for over 4 months for legislation on Zika, ever since the CDC and the administration requested $1.9 billion in emergency funding to deal with the threat. We tried to work with our friends on the other side of the aisle, but after we compromised at $1.1 billion, after we reached a supposed agreement, and passed it in this body with 89 votes— the overwhelming majority from both parties—Republicans turned around, without any consultation with Demo-crats in the House and Senate, and rammed through a wish list of poison pill riders that defeat the very purpose of the effort. Rather than working with Democrats to produce something both parties can support, Republicans aban-doned compromise in favor of an ex-treme rightwing bill. These changes reflected in the con-ference report have poisoned the bill. It now cuts Ebola funding by $107 million. It cuts funding for the Affordable Care Act by $543 million. It sets a precedent that emergencies have to be funded when, in the past, they have not been. Worst of all, it restricts funding for family planning services provided by health centers and providers like Planned Parenthood. We know Zika can be sexually trans-mitted. We know it poses the biggest danger to pregnant women and their unborn children, many of whom rely on health centers and Planned Parenthood as their primary health care provider, but Republicans cannot miss a chance to whack Planned Parenthood, even if their services are exactly what can help prevent the spread of this debili-tating virus.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES4594 June 28, 2016 
I listened to my friend, the majority leader. Two words never passed his lips as he talked about the bill—Planned Parenthood. Why? Because he knows saying don’t fund Planned Parenthood is a poison pill if there ever was one. He knows it was a poison pill last year when we were negotiating a short-term budget agreement and there would be no budget if it was in there. Our Republican leaders are engaged in a cynical game. They have to have assure the hard right they are not funding anything, even something as important as Zika, but they know the American people demand funding, and so they put in these poison pills. It is a cynical game and it shall not stand. My prediction is Republicans will come back after this amendment, as they know this proposal will be de-feated—they knew it—and they will come back within a few weeks with their tail between their legs saying: Let’s pass something. We know we have to do something on Zika. Why they don’t avoid that embar-rassment is beyond me. To say that this Zika legislation is a day late and a dollar short would be a drastic under-statement. It is 4 months late, $800 bil-lion short, and now, to boot, it can-nibalizes health care funding from other important priorities. Then, after all of this, the distin-guished majority leader came to the floor yesterday to accuse Democrats of playing politics with the bill because we were concerned with these changes. What a cynical and hypocritical thing to do. All Democrats have ever asked for on Zika was to give the CDC and the other agencies the funding they said they needed to do the job of pro-tecting the American people, pregnant mothers, and their babies from this dangerous virus. It wasn’t Democrats who said: Let’s give CDC only about half the money they said they need. No, Republicans did that. It wasn’t Democrats who tried to jam through poison pill amendments to the bill in the dead of night with no debate. No, Republicans did that. It wasn’t Democrats who dithered for months on end until mosquito season was already upon us to bring a bill for-ward. No, Republicans did that. And it wasn’t Democrats who loaded up the bill with partisan plums, saying that unless the other side passes this bill, they are playing politics. Oh, no, it was Republicans who did that. Moreover, these tactics mean one thing: Our Republican colleagues and particularly the Republican leadership, in both the House and Senate, are not taking the Zika threat seriously. It is no way to handle an urgent public health crisis. We will shortly hear from my friend from Florida who can document what is happening in his State and what will happen in many other States as the warmer summer season moves on. There are 2,600 Americans who have been diagnosed with the virus, includ-ing over 400 pregnant women. Six preg-nancies have already been deemed to have birth defects as a result of Zika. Americans in Puerto Rico are espe-cially impacted with 1,800 locally ac-quired cases. It is a tragedy, and we should be doing something in a bipar-tisan way—Democrats and Republicans together—working to solve an emer-gency. But, no, we get a bill riddled with poison pills done by one party, de-signed to fail in obeisance to the right-wing, which doesn’t want to spend any money. Our public health and safety is at risk. I hope my Republican colleagues will stop this partisan gambit and come around to work with us on the issue in a serious bipartisan way. We are willing to compromise, as the great leadership of the Senator from Wash-ington showed when she came to com-promise with the Senator from Ten-nessee on a proposal that didn’t do ev-erything we wanted, but we voted for it. I hope that can happen again. If saner heads are going to prevail, it has to be in this body. I hope Leader M
CCONNELL would rethink the strategy of going along with the cynical House bill so we can negotiate something that will do good for America. I yield the floor. Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am furious and fed up at Congress’s inabil-ity to act in a bipartisan way to pro-tect us from the Zika virus. The U.S. is facing a public health emergency. Americans are desperate for Congress to respond. Instead, the House of Rep-resentatives passed a Military Con-struction and Veterans Affairs and Zika conference report at 3 a.m. with no debate and no Democratic input. The bill passed by House Republicans doesn’t recognize Zika as a public health emergency. It nickels and dimes our efforts to respond. It makes it more difficult for women to access birth control. And it waives safety rules for the use of pesticides. Now the House has left town and expects the Senate to pass this terrible bill. The facts are clear: Zika is here. It disproportionately affects women and babies. It causes horrible birth defects. And there is no treatment or vaccine. If there was ever a time that Congress should act in a bipartisan way to counter a significant threat, it is now. We are now considering cloture on the conference report on Military Con-struction and Veterans Affairs and Zika appropriations. We began the con-ference with an open meeting between Democrats and Republicans, the House and the Senate. But when we got down to the last, hardest issues, Republicans decided among themselves and then told Democrats, ‘‘take it or leave it.’’ That means no Democratic conferees signed the conference report, House or Senate. We can’t sign it if it means leaving behind veterans, women’s health, birth defects prevention, and clean water. I urge the Senate to reject cloture on this conference report and send conferees back to the drawing board. The Republican conference report is flawed for many reasons, including that it provides $1.1 billion, which is $800 million less than what the Presi-dent requested to fight Zika. The Republican conference report also doesn’t treat Zika like the emer-gency it is. The World Health Organiza-tion declared the Zika virus a public health emergency on February 1. And Zika meets the Budget Act criteria for emergency spending: It is urgent, un-foreseen, and temporary. Yet Repub-licans insisted that we cut $750 million to pay for the response to Zika, includ-ing $543 million from the Affordable Care Act, $100 million from the Depart-ment of Health and Human Services, HHS, nonrecurring expense fund, and $107 million from Ebola response funds. When wildfires hit the West, Con-gress provided emergency funding. When flooding hit South Carolina and Texas last year, Congress provided emergency funding. Now, we have an infectious disease outbreak that we know causes serious birth defects, and Republicans insist our response be paid for. The conference report waives Clean Water Act requirements for the spray-ing of pesticides to control mosquitos. The need for this provision is a mys-tery to me, since the Clean Water Act already allows pesticides to be sprayed in pest emergencies. Under this bill, families can get birth control services from public health de-partments and hospitals, but not indi-vidual doctors or primary care clinics. This is important. The bill would make it more difficult for women to access birth control from their own doctors. I know the issue of birth control is difficult for some, but we know that Zika has terrible consequences for women and babies. The details about what Zika does to the brains of unborn children are truly horrific. In fact, evi-dence between Zika and birth defects is so conclusive that some countries are advising women to avoid pregnancy al-together. So the fact that this bill would make it more difficult for women to avoid pregnancy is truly astonishing to me. Republicans don’t want to treat Zika as an emergency, and they don’t want to expand access to birth control. It begs the question: Will they be willing to pay the costs associated with every child born in this country with Zika- related birth defects? Dr. Frieden, di-rector of the Centers for Disease Con-trol and Prevention, estimated that cost to be $10 million per child. Lastly, the conference report is $500 million short of the Senate-approved funding level for the Department of Veterans Affairs, VA. It cuts $250 mil-lion for needed maintenance for VA hospitals and clinics, more than half of which are 50 years or older. That means more leaking roofs and moldy conditions that make veterans sicker, not better. In the 4 months since the President requested Zika emergency funds, more

people have been infected, and more babies have been born with birth de-fects. Today there are more than 2,600 people in the U.S. and its territories in-fected with Zika, including nearly 500 pregnant women. The number of those infected is grow-ing, and the costs associated with in-fection are growing. We can’t nickel and dime our way out of this emer-gency. We know what the threat is, and we know how to respond to it. So, please, whatever differences we have on other bills, let’s come together to reach agreement on a better conference report. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from West Virginia. 
FLOODING IN WEST VIRGINIA  
Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, wow, I come to the floor of the Senate to talk about a real emergency that just oc-curred in my State of West Virginia. I know many of you across the country have witnessed and seen the terrible destruction from the sudden flash flood that ravaged West Virginia on Thurs-day in the late afternoon and evening. I come with such a heavy heart. When I hear the debate going on again about who is more cynical and who has poison pills, all I can think about is the little boy I saw at the Vol-unteer Fire Department in Clendenin on Friday. His dad is a fire chief, and he had been going to the fire depart-ment all the time since the time he was born. He is about 10 years old. We were standing in 6 inches of mud, with destruction everywhere in his town. I introduced myself to him, and I said: I am S
HELLEY . I am your Senator. How are you doing? He just melted into tears because he was so distraught at what he saw, a place he loved, the fire station just ripped apart. People he knows were kicked out of their homes, trying to figure out how to rebuild. To me, that is a real emergency. That is a real something we in the Sen-ate and those in the State and those local responders are responding to now. I think about our State, I think about all the nicknames of the State of West Virginia. The one I think I like the most is ‘‘Almost Heaven.’’ Well, ‘‘Al-most Heaven’’ wasn’t almost Heaven last Thursday. ‘‘Wild and Wonderful.’’ It was wild, all right but not so won-derful. I think the one that really has come to epitomize our West Virginians, our people, is ‘‘West Virginia Strong’’. I saw the National Guard, the West Vir-ginia Department of Transportation, public elected officials, emergency services personnel, and EMTs who were up all night doing very dangerous boat rescues to get people from the roofs of their homes and the roofs of their cars. It came so fast. I visited the shelter at Capital High School yesterday. A man told me he, the woman he lives with, and their dog just ran out with nothing. It started at his ankles, and 5 minutes later it was at his waist. That is how fast it was. Yet he still had that West Virginia strong attitude of: We are going to be OK. We are going to find a way. He had lost his car, his four-wheeler. All of his belongings are gone. He has nothing. Now he has a place to sleep in a high school gym. You know what. He has the American Red Cross right there, with 400 volun-teers from across the country so he has a warm place to sleep or a cool place to sleep away from the hot Sun, meals, the availability of cleaning supplies, and a very generous community that has come together to try to help him. That is West Virginia strong, and that is what fortifies me today. When I think of the stories of brav-ery and rescue, when you look at the 23 West Virginians who lost their lives so suddenly—a little 4-year-old boy, Ed-ward McMillion from Ravenswood, WV, was swept away in the rushing water. We just have story after story of people who didn’t know what was going to happen to them, who didn’t know how to get out, who found a way to brave through this awful thing. Then there were the stories of the communities coming together. When we were traveling through Kanawha County, I ran into some people from Parkersburg and some people from Martinsburg, which probably doesn’t mean much to the folks in the Gallery or to the Presiding Officer because they don’t know where that is, but it is 5 hours away. They just packed up their trucks, put water and food in them, and came to the aid of their fel-low West Virginians. A lot of faith communities, a lot of churches, the Mountain Mission, all kinds of volun-teers have come to help to be West Vir-ginia strong, to be West Virginians helping West Virginians. The private sector has really stepped up. AT&T, Sprint, Frontier—our tele-communications people have really gone the extra mile to make sure that people have service and are able to charge their phones. When they had to leave their homes, they might have had their phone in their pocket, but they sure didn’t have their phone charger. While that might sound like a little thing, it is a big thing. That is your lifeline to your family—to calling for help and for resources. Walmart, Proctor & Gamble, CSX, and Dow Chemical—I am leaving peo-ple out—also helped out. Anheuser- Busch brought a bunch of water in to help. I have more stories of companies that have given their corporate sup-plies to help West Virginia get back on its feet. I am basically here to say thank you. Some of the communities, such as Clendenin, White Sulfur Springs, Rupert, and Rainelle—I actually thought Rainelle’s name is Rainelle, and, boy, did they get rained on. They are probably regretting the name. They lost a lot of people in Rainelle. That small community has been crushed. FEMA has been phenomenal. The declaration from the President, for which we are very grateful, came im-mediately for the three counties. We are hoping to get other counties, such as Webster County, Roane County, Clay County, Pocahontas County, and Fayette County included in these dec-larations. Fifty-five homes in Webster Springs were totally wiped out. It has a population of 750. We all know and love the beautiful West Virginia mountains, but when the valleys fill, they fill rap-idly and disastrously. FEMA is on the ground. They have opened up their disaster recovery cen-ters in White Sulfur Springs, Greenbrier, and other places. They will be all over the place. I will tell people that what I have learned from this is that you have to get registered for individual assistance immediately. Call the phone number, go to the Web site, or go to the disaster recovery center because that starts the process, and help is there. The Small Business Administration is there, as well, to try and help. The various health departments are providing tetanus shots free of charge because, as we know, sitting water and 90-degree temperatures are scenarios for disease. What I was astounded by was the mud. We know that you can get water in your home and business, but the mud is just so destructively horrifying to look at and so difficult to clean. West Virginians need help for all types of different things. People from all around the Nation have been offer-ing to help. We have been inundated with people wanting to help. People want to come and lift up another American and lift up another family. I say thank you for that, but this is going to be a long-term project. When you have the kind of destruction we suffered, it goes on for a long time. During the first week you get a lot of help, but the weeks after that, when people are trying to rebuild and trying to get temporary transitional hous-ing—these are the kind of things that families need. Just to give a little perspective on the situation, the National Weather Service said that the rainfall was his-toric. There was 10 to 12 inches of rain-fall in 8 hours. It was a 1,000-year event in terms of the rising waters. I live a half mile from the Elk River, which crested at 33.37 feet on Friday morning. The water rose more than 27 feet be-tween Thursday afternoon and Friday morning and hit its highest crest in 125 years. This was a record-breaking event and very tragic for many of us. I wish to thank FEMA for all of the representation they brought forward. I thank all of the faith community, which has been phenomenal. I also thank the nonprofits, the United Way, and the Red Cross. I have such admira-tion and gratitude in my heart for what I saw firsthand and will see as the days move on. I will close the way I started. West Virginia people are just phenomenal. They are able to pick themselves up and still have a glimmer of hope in

their eyes. Knowing that they will be OK and will be able to rebuild after having lost everything is just phe-nomenal. I was in a meeting yesterday, and the guy leading the charge from the United Way said: Everybody close your eyes and think about the last time you lost everything. I don’t think a person in that room had ever lost everything. I thank you for all the thoughts and prayers that you kept in your heart for us. We feel them, we need them, and we appreciate them. It is a long road to re-covery, but we are on our way. With your help and God’s help, we will get there. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Washington. Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I want to start by saying how disappointed I was by the comments I heard from Re-publican leaders last night on Zika. It seems that after months and months of their delaying, after they rejected our bipartisan plan, kicked Democrats out of the negotiating room, and passed a partisan bill in the middle of the night, Republicans are now scrambling to blame anyone but themselves for their own inaction on Zika. It is absurd, it is irresponsible, and people across the country are not going to buy it. Republicans control Congress. They blocked action for months and months. They fought us at every step, and now that they finally realized that the American people aren’t going to stand for inaction, they are desperately searching for excuses instead of hon-estly looking for solutions. But women and families aren’t looking for Repub-licans to point fingers; they are look-ing for a serious response to Zika. We all know very well that Demo-crats and Republicans don’t always see eye to eye, but one thing we should be able to agree on is that when there is a serious, national, and global public health threat, we should put our dif-ferences aside and work together to protect women, families, and commu-nities. Unfortunately, when it comes to the Zika virus, Republicans are now doing the exact opposite. It has been 4 months since President Obama first put forward a strong emer-gency funding proposal. Even though we are in the midst of mosquito season, the House Republicans chose last week to double down on a partisan, pan-dering bill when it comes to this fright-ening virus. Instead of working with Democrats on a serious response to Zika, they voted to end the conference, pass an extremely partisan report in the middle of the night, and leave town. There is a lot to be concerned about in this legislation, but, critically, this proposal would impose politically mo-tivated restrictions that limit women’s access to contraception and health care with providers they rely on. It should go without saying, but in the midst of a public health emergency that im-pacts women and families, the last thing Republicans should be doing is playing politics with women’s health and making it harder for them to get care when and where they need it. It is truly frustrating, especially since just weeks ago, Senate Democrats and Re-publicans agreed on a bipartisan down-payment on the President’s proposal, and that bipartisan legislation could have already passed the House and Sen-ate, could have been signed into law by the President, and started helping women and families in need by now. Today, ahead of the Senate’s vote on this partisan political proposal that came out of the House in the middle of the night last week, we have a clear message for Republicans: Enough is enough—enough with the partisanship, enough with the poison pills, and enough with using women’s health to pander to the tea party. We have a nar-row window to get an effective re-sponse to this virus under way, and every infection that we prevent now is a potential tragedy averted for a fam-ily in the communities we serve. Democrats are ready to work to-gether, just as we have been for months. I urge Republicans to come back to the negotiating table and work with us on a real response to a truly se-rious public health threat. Women and families are expecting us to act and have already waited long enough. I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Florida. Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, it was my understanding that the Senator from Hawaii was to speak next. I ask through the Chair if the Sen-ator from South Dakota will let me go on and make a comment. Mr. THUNE. And I will follow, cor-rect? The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, we have just a short time before the vote. The President made a request for emer-gency funding in the amount of $1.9 bil-lion 4 months ago. This is a time when the Nation has an emergency. It doesn’t matter if it is an earthquake, a flood, a wildfire, a hurricane, or a vol-cano, we have always stepped forward. If you don’t believe this Zika crisis is an emergency, well, just wait. The tale tell signs are coming. We already have 50 confirmed cases of Zika in the United States. There are 2,600 Americans who are infected with the virus, and that includes 500 preg-nant women. Obviously, the southern States, such as my State of Florida, are affected much more than other States. Just yesterday there were three new cases of the virus reported in Flor-ida, which brings the State’s total to 223, including 40 pregnant women. These numbers are only going to in-crease. Four months after the request for emergency funding, the House—in the dark of night, with no opportunity to have a debate—passed a bill to deal with this virus, and as you have heard from many, it is not serious. Instead, it is another attempt to use an emer-gency must-pass bill to try to further extremist political agendas. It cuts money for Puerto Rico at a time that Puerto Rico can hardly stand on its own financially, and it cuts money for family planning. The CDC has confirmed that Zika can be sexually transmitted. What did I say? They cut money for family plan-ning, and there are over 480 pregnant women in the United States who are presently being monitored for signs of the infection. As we look for ways to prevent the spread of this sexually transmitted disease, the fact that this bill limits access to contraceptives that could help curb the spread of the virus is exactly the reverse of what makes sense. Why can’t we grow up and get to the point that we don’t have to play par-tisan politics? This is a real threat, and it is a serious threat. The CDC has con-firmed that Zika does, in fact, cause birth defects. There have been four ba-bies born with microcephalus in the country, and two of them died shortly after birth. We have seen the pictures, and we know how horrific and how tragic it is for the families involved. So we need to stop playing these political games. It is time to treat this as a real emergency, and it is time to pass the appropriations bill without all of this political agenda added to it. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from South Dakota. Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, in a few short moments Senate Democrats will have a decision to make. Will they side with American families and expectant mothers dealing with the Zika virus or will they side with their far left polit-ical allies? According to media reports, unfortunately, that outcome is increas-ingly clear. Senate Democrats will once again side with their political al-lies rather than working with Repub-licans on a solution to keep women safe from the Zika virus. Mr. President, Democrats have ap-parently decided to engage in their fa-vorite game of late—refusing to take yes for an answer. It happened last week with terrorism. Democrats urged us to pass legislation to keep guns out of the hands of terrorists, but when Senator C
ORNYN offered an amendment to do just that, Democrats opposed it almost unanimously. This week it is Zika funding. Six weeks ago, Democrats and Re-publicans from the relevant commit-tees in the Senate got together and agreed on a bill to provide $1.1 billion to fight Zika. That bill then came to the floor, and every Democrat voted for it on the floor of the Senate—every sin-gle Democrat. Last week, House and Senate nego-tiators reconciled the House and Sen-ate bills and agreed on Zika funding in the amount of $1.1 billion—in other

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4597 June 28, 2016 
words, the exact same amount that Senate Democrats unanimously sup-ported 6 weeks ago. But now Demo-crats don’t want to support it. Their reason is that the small grant program in this bill, most of which is intended for Puerto Rico, will not provide for more Federal funding for Planned Par-enthood. This bill provides expanded funding for community health centers, public health departments, and hospitals. It actually funds more avenues for access to women’s health care than what the President requested. The bill funds re-search into a Zika vaccine. It funds re-search into Zika treatments. It stream-lines mosquito control efforts, since the best way to protect men, women, and babies from contracting the Zika virus is to make sure they do not get bitten by a mosquito in the first place. The head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention—the lead gov-ernment agency for fighting diseases— has said that the Republican bill will take care of immediate Zika funding needs. Yet Democrats are holding up this bill because it will not fund a handful of Planned Parenthood clinics in Puerto Rico. Seriously, Mr. President? Seriously? That is what this is about? Democrats like to position themselves as having the moral high ground. Again and again Democrats suggested that they were fiercely committed to fighting Zika while Republicans were dragging their feet on a public health crisis. Well, here is what I see today. I see Republicans ready to pass a Zika bill and send it to the President this minute, right now. And I see Demo-crats who are more interested in paci-fying a Democrat special interest group than they are in actually doing anything about Zika. Purely and sim-ply, that is what this is—a Democratic special interest group that snapped its fingers, and the Democrats have all come running. Forget all that urgency about get-ting Zika funding passed. Forget the scientists who are waiting for vaccine funding. And forget about mosquito control efforts. Apparently, none of that matters anymore. Republicans are ready to pass Zika funding, the same amount—I will repeat: the same amount—of funding Democrats already voted for unanimously in the Senate. We are ready to pass it right now, this minute, and send it to the President. We are just waiting for Democrats to agree. Mr. President, I hope they will not keep the American people waiting. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Hawaii. Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, yester-day I joined millions of Americans in celebrating the Supreme Court’s deci-sion that reaffirms a woman’s right to access reproductive health care. This was the most important Supreme Court decision in decades to protect a woman’s access to reproductive health care. I listened to my colleague just now, and, yes, the amount in the bill is the same. But this is not the same bill. This bill contains poison pills that will pay for the funding for Zika on the backs of the people of Puerto Rico and funding for Planned Parenthood. So today, in spite of yesterday’s celebra-tion of the Supreme Court’s decision, it is clear we are reminded once again the fight to protect a woman’s reproduc-tive rights is not over. I was dismayed last week when House Republicans chose to play politics with a national public health emergency to continue their crusade against Planned Parenthood. The package we will be voting on this morning is profoundly irresponsible. Senators from both par-ties worked hard to forge a compromise Zika funding measure that would have provided the tools we need to prevent an outbreak. Instead, we will shortly be voting on an underfunded measure riddled with poison pills. This package is not equal to the cri-sis before us. It fails to recognize the real threat facing American women from Zika this summer. Zika is not just a mosquito-borne disease. It can also be sexually transmitted. That is why attacking Planned Parenthood in this bill is so foolish. Limiting access to family planning services now would put millions more women at risk of contracting Zika and giving birth to a child with microcephaly. The United States is fortunate not to have a widespread outbreak of Zika yet, but in Hawaii we are already feel-ing the impact of this virus. So far there have been 10 confirmed cases of Zika in Hawaii, and one child has been born with microcephaly. To meet this challenge, I have con-vened key leaders on Zika in Hawaii, including Governor David Ige, Hawaii director of health Dr. Virginia Press-ler, health care providers, and Dr. El-liott Parks, who is developing a Zika vaccine on Oahu. They all shared one message: Federal funding right now is critical to get ahead of a widespread Zika outbreak. Dr. Parks has been using private funding to develop his vaccine, which could turn around our fight against Zika, and an infusion of Federal funds now could push him across the finish line. This summer is a critical moment in the fight against the Zika virus. In Ha-waii, we already saw the devastating impact of a vector-borne disease when we confronted a major outbreak of Dengue. We need the same national commitment and investment to fight Zika that we provided to fight Ebola. Months have already passed since the President sent down his emergency funding request for Zika. We must act now by passing a clean supplemental spending bill, with no harmful riders to women. Zika is a public health crisis in the making, and I completely disagree with my colleagues who continue to say that we should support this bill be-cause it is what we have already agreed to. It is not. It is a profoundly different bill that continues the Republican at-tacks against women’s reproductive rights. Mr. President, I yield the floor. Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, do I un-derstand that we are in the parliamen-tary procedure where the vote has al-ready been called for at 11 o’clock? The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct. Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, may I be recognized for 2 minutes? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator has no time. That will take con-sent. Mr. NELSON. Say again. The PRESIDING OFFICER. That will take consent of the Senate. There is no time remaining for the minority. Mr. NELSON. Well, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 2 minutes, until the vote at 11 clock, in order to bring the Senate up to date on what has hap-pened to the community of Orlando. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Mr. COCHRAN. Reserving the right to object, we are trying to set up a con-versation about the conference report, and I wonder, would it be inconvenient for the Senator to defer? Mr. NELSON. I can certainly—I didn’t see anybody on the floor, and that is why—— Mr. COCHRAN. We were just passing through, checking to see what the order was, and I understand there is a standing order. So we are going to wind up, we hope, with just a few minutes of conversation about the conference report. Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I can speak later in the day. Mr. COCHRAN. I thank the Senator. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Mississippi. Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, we have come to a point where it is timely that we urge the Senate to approve the Military Construction and Veterans Af-fairs conference report. This conference agreement increases funding for veterans programs by near-ly 9 percent, including a 4.1-percent in-crease in discretionary funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs. The agreement provides funding for vet-erans health care, benefit claims proc-essing, and medical research. The agreement funds housing for military personnel and their families and en-hances the capabilities of U.S. military forces. The conference agreement also in-cludes $1.1 billion in emergency supple-mental funding to fight the Zika virus. This is the same amount previously ap-proved by the Senate. These funds will be used for mosquito control, vaccine development, and health services. The conference agreement also enhances mosquito control efforts by elimi-nating duplicative permitting require-ments for approved pesticides. This provision is specific to combating the Zika virus, and it expires after 180 days.

The conference agreement carries re-scissions of previously appropriated funds that are not needed for their original purpose. The fact that rescis-sions are included is not novel or unique. For example, the appropria-tions bill that provided funding to fight the Ebola virus included nearly $5 bil-lion in discretionary rescissions and $2.5 billion in mandatory rescissions. This conference agreement is the re-sult of extensive bipartisan negotia-tions. It is a good bill, and it should be sent to the President without delay. I urge the adoption of the conference re-port.

Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will state. The legislative clerk read as follows:

ORDER FOR RECESS  
Mr. M CCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Sen-ate recess from 12:30 p.m. until 2:15 p.m. to allow for the weekly caucus meetings. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, here is where we are. We have a public health crisis descending on our coun-try. We have been talking about this for 3 months. The administration and the CDC—all involved—said we need to get this Zika funding bill done before the Fourth of July—before the Fourth of July. This conference report, which was just prevented from passage, has exactly the same funding level that every single Democrat voted for when it left the Senate—exactly the same funding level. We know that if we don’t get this job done, we won’t have a vaccine within a year and a half. In the short term, we have been told that the single most ef-fective thing we can do is kill as many mosquitoes as possible as fast as pos-sible right here in the United States, in the southern part of our country. So here we are in an utterly absurd position of playing political games as this public health crisis mounts here in our country. Pregnant women all across America are looking at this with utter dismay, as we sit here in a partisan gridlock manufactured by the other side over issues that it is pretty hard for the general public to under-stand, refusing to pass the funds need-ed to address this public health con-cern. If that were not bad enough, we have also stopped the passage of the MILCON-Veterans’ Administration ap-propriations conference report, which includes funding for our veterans and funding for construction at military bases. So here we are going into the Fourth of July and we have impeded the pas-sage of funding to deal with an impend-ing public health crisis and in the same vote managed to vote against veterans as well. I would say to my colleagues on the other side, that is where we will be when we come back here after this brief break for the Fourth of July. I have moved to reconsider. I have changed my vote and moved to recon-sider. I would like to call on my col-leagues on the other side of the aisle to think about this, to think about where they have left this issue for the Amer-ican people. I have been approached in my State—and I know others have as well—by young women concerned about whether we are going to address this issue now, not at some time in the future. So when we get back, after we have had time to think about it all, we will address this matter again and hope-fully respond, as our constituents all across America are asking us to re-spond, to this pending health care cri-sis that we all understand. There has been plenty of discussion about this for months. This Republican majority has met the deadline, but we can’t pass it by ourselves here in the Senate. I hope our Democratic friends, upon reflection over the course of the few days we will be away, will come back with a dif-ferent attitude, and I hope we can ad-dress this crisis and address it now. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader. Mr. REID. Mr. President, as I said this morning, and I will repeat it, I don’t know what universe my friend is living in. What does he think—that we are all stupid, that the American peo-ple are dumb? They are not. They un-derstand what is going on here. We have been trying for months— months. The President asked more than 4 months ago that we would get money to fight Zika. He had already had to take $500 million from Ebola be-cause the Republicans had done noth-ing. He said more than 4 months ago: We need money. The CDC needs money. The NIH needs money. We have a crisis on our hands. So we have been on top of this. We have worked hard. Republicans have objected five times to moving legisla-tion that is meaningful. On April 28, the senior Senator from Texas objected to my request. On May 18, he objected to my unanimous consent request again and to Senator M
URRAY ’s re-quest—all in the same day. On May 24, he objected to Senator M
URRAY ’s re-quest again for funding Zika. On May 24—the same day—Senator E
NZIob-jected to Senator N
ELSON ’s unanimous consent request. He said that we need to reflect. Come on. Listen to this. If Republicans were sitting around, as I assume they were in the House, as we were all watching the takeover of the House floor by House Democrats—there wasn’t any-thing going on on the House floor, so I assume—I assume—they were sitting around thinking: What can we do to fake funding for Zika? What can we do? Well, maybe what we can do is say we

have money for Zika and then we could do everything we can to irritate them. So what they did is they said: Well, we realize this is a serious issue, but these pregnant women are the ones they are concerned about, so why don’t we stop them from going to obtain birth control. We hate Planned Parent-hood, so why don’t we stop them from going to Planned Parenthood—these desperate women who need birth con-trol and some advice about their situa-tion. A significant number of American women—especially young women—go to Planned Parenthood. On the bill we have that was just turned down today, the Republicans said: You can’t do that. We are not going to allow that. It restricts funding for birth control provided by Planned Parenthood. How about that one. But if that weren’t enough, they cut veterans funding by $500 million. And then I guess they said: Well, maybe we can do some-thing—we know we hate the environ-ment. We don’t like all those greenies, so why don’t we do this. We know that it is important that we control mosqui-toes. If we are going to do anything re-garding mosquitoes, let’s kill a lot of those mosquitoes. Oh, here is what we will do. We will exempt the Clean Water Act from the provisions of spraying pesticides. Against all environmental advice that we could get, they go ahead and do it anyway. They cut Ebola funding by another $107 million. They rescind ObamaCare by $543 million, after they have already failed 70 times to repeal it. But if that weren’t enough, listen to this one. How about this one. I guess they said: What else could we do to really stick it in their eye? There is a prohibition now in the law that says that you can’t fly the Confederate flag at our military ceme-teries. Let’s take that away. We want to be able to fly Confederate flags at military cemeteries. So they put that in there too. What do they think this is? When we passed here by almost 90 votes a bill that gave not as much money as we wanted, but $1.1 billion, it was treated as an emergency, as emer-gencies should be treated. It is no dif-ferent from a flood or a fire or an earthquake. We passed it here and sent it to the House. The night they were there on the House floor, there was chaos. One of the Presiding Officers came out and in a matter of a minute said: We are going to pass a conference report funding Zika—funding Zika—but it makes it so that you can’t go to Planned Parent-hood for birth control. We are cutting $500 million from veterans, we are going to affect how we spray pesticides, we are going to cut Ebola funding, we are going to cut ObamaCare, and we are going to, just for good measure— just for good measure, we will throw in the Confederate flag thing. I was here a week ago, and 2,200 women at that time were infected with Zika. Here it is 1 week later, and it is 2,900. About 100 women a day are being infected with Zika. We don’t know how many of these pregnant women—there are about 500 now who are pregnant who have been infected with Zika—we don’t know how many of those women are going to give birth to children who are tremendously handicapped. They have shrunken brains, and their skulls are caved in sometimes. As we sit here dithering because of this foolishness on Planned Parent-hood, the Clean Water Act, cutting vet-erans funding, Ebola funding, ObamaCare, Confederate flag, each day more women are prevented from get-ting the attention they need for birth control. It is unbelievable that someone would have the audacity to come to the floor and say: Well, it is the Demo-crats’ fault. It is the Democrats’ fault. We think you should get some money for Zika funding. It should be offset; it wouldn’t be truly emergency funding. But in the process, go ahead and let’s whack ObamaCare, Ebola money, vet-erans, Planned Parenthood, the Confed-erate flag. I mean, I can’t imagine how anyone would have the audacity to come to the floor and talk about what a great piece of legislation this is. We know what is in the bill. We have had a woman who has worked so hard on this who is one of the premier Senators ever to serve in this body, Senator M
IKULSKI from Maryland. B
ILLNELSON cares about this in Florida because his State has been hit harder than any other State. But Senator M
IKULSKI has worked hard on appropriations bills. We know how important this bill is. We know how much she wants it passed, but she doesn’t want it with this awful stuff that they have tried to do with Planned Parenthood, the Clean Water Act, veterans funding, and all of this other craziness, including the Confed-erate flag. It is hard to describe. I sat here this morning when the Senate was opening. I have been here a long time. I don’t re-member anything as outrageous and as shameful as this piece of legislation. Believe me, in the last 7
1⁄2years, the Republicans have come up with a lot, but this is the worst. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Re-publican whip. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I will tell you what shameful is. It is allow-ing more women of childbearing age to contract the Zika virus so their babies can end up looking like this. That is shameful. Make no mistake about it—our col-leagues across the aisle have filibus-tered on a partisan basis a bipartisan bill that funded our anti-Zika efforts. It also included measures to support our veterans. So we need to be absolutely clear. I heard the Democratic leader basically saying that, because his party is a sore loser in a conference report they don’t love, they are going to block funding to prevent more babies from contracting the birth defect that is suffered by this baby shown in this picture. Microcephaly, basically, is a shrunk-en skull. This baby’s prognosis is not good. Women of child-bearing age are scared to death that their baby will end up like this baby. Yet their con-cerns have fallen on deaf ears among those in this Chamber—largely Demo-crats—who voted against advancing this legislation. We are getting closer to mosquito season. The warmer weather means we are going to see more mosquitoes, and we need to get this on the President’s desk as soon as possible. The President himself asked for $1.9 billion in funding and is calling this a public health emergency, but our Democratic friends blocked it because they are sore losers in a conference negotiation report that they don’t like. We know that this virus can affect an entire generation. This birth defect is heartbreaking and life-altering, and we know it has taken a tremendous toll in much of Latin America. Fortunately, so far the only cases of Zika virus in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control, are from people who have traveled to South America and Central America and con-tracted the virus there and came home. So at least so far, the mosquitoes that carry this disease are not spreading it in the United States, but we know that will change soon. That is why we heard from the Senators from Florida, Texas, and others. They talked about its po-tential impact in the United States and particularly in our warmer States. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, severe microcephaly like this is associated with seizures, intellectual disability, hearing and vision problems, and devel-opmental delays, and that is assuming this child survives into adulthood, which most, unfortunately, do not. So how can our friends across the aisle who voted against this conference re-port, which provides Zika funding, look the mother of this baby in the eye and say: We have plenty of good reasons to deny help for more children like yours. We know this impacts not only chil-dren and these babies, but it also im-pacts whole families. It means mothers and fathers anxious about the welfare of their baby are regularly going to the doctor to gauge progress and check de-velopment. It means finding speech, oc-cupational, and physical therapies to help the child live as long of a normal life as they can. One neurologist quoted in the New York Times said: ‘‘There is no way to fix the problem, just therapies to deal with the down-stream consequences.’’ So once a baby like this contracts the Zika virus, there is no way to fix the problem. The only defense is to pre-vent children like this from getting the Zika virus by getting the funding that Democrats just voted down to the med-ical authorities so they can look for a vaccine and so we can do mosquito

eradication and the other things we know we need to do from a public health perspective to prevent more ba-bies like this one from developing these devastating birth defects. As I said, there is no cure. Once a baby has it, he or she has it for life. That means that the family will have to live with the great uncertainty about the health and well-being of their child as they consider the lifelong implications of caring for a child with this kind of disability. We know we don’t have to accept this as the outcome. We know there is a way to fight it, and that is by pre-venting the Zika virus from spreading to the United States, but unfortu-nately Senate Democrats just voted against that. As I said, there are already hundreds of travel-related cases of the virus scattered throughout the country, and I hope the administration does more to underscore the real health threats that exist when people travel to areas where Zika is at its worst. That is why I joined with one of our House colleagues who is a medical doctor, Congressman M
ICHAEL BURGESS , in asking Secretary of State Kerry and the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-vention, Dr. Frieden, how they are co-ordinating travel warnings to regions where Zika has run rampant. Texans and all Americans need to understand the risks associated with travel to those areas, and they need real-time, accurate information so they can de-termine whether they should alter their travel plans. Over the past few months, the mos-quitoes who carry this virus have been inching their way north, and today lo-cally transmitted cases have been re-ported in Puerto Rico and throughout the Caribbean. In other words, this virus, along with its devastating ef-fects, is at our doorstep. I had a chance to visit with experts in my State at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston and the Texas Medical Center, and they agree this is a major public health concern and we need to act and act soon. That is why we have to prepare for the ar-rival of the mosquitoes that carry this virus in the United States, something that our Democratic colleagues have just prevented. Fortunately, counties and cities throughout Texas have al-ready been working hard to counter the spread of the virus. When I was in Houston recently, pub-lic health officials back in April told me about measures they were imple-menting to track and manage the spread of Zika throughout the Houston area, one of the most populous urban areas in the country, and the efforts to eradicate the breeding grounds of the mosquitoes that transmit the virus. Governor Abbott of Texas is also tak-ing steps to make sure that we are as prepared as possible. But we can’t do it alone. Unfortunately, the sort of help that is needed by States like mine for mothers and fathers who could have children like this has just been blocked. Governor Abbott invited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to review the State’s plan to combat the virus and he appointed an infectious disease task force to make policy rec-ommendations on how to prevent and respond to infectious diseases includ-ing Zika. States like mine and commu-nities like Houston are doing their part, but Senate Democrats refuse to do their part. So it should go without saying that now on the frontlines of this major public health concern we need to respond at the Federal level. That is why it is shocking and shame-ful to see so many Senate Democrats oppose this bipartisan effort to guard against the virus, particularly because they have repeatedly called for an ex-pedited resolution of this appropria-tions request. Over a month ago, the minority lead-er made clear that he viewed Zika funding a major priority and one that demanded action. Senator REID, the Democratic leader, on May 23, 2016, said: ‘‘Instead of gam-bling with the health and safety of mil-lions of Americans, Republicans should give our Nation the money it needs to fight Zika, and they should do it now. Not next month, not in the fall—now.’’ Well, of course, Senator R
EIDwas ad-vocating bypassing the Senate legisla-tive process, and it was really inappro-priate for him to demand a $1.9 billion spending appropriation that adds to the deficit and debt without letting Congress do its job, but now the House and Senate have both passed legisla-tion and agreed to a conference report that Senate Democrats have just voted down. Senator R
EIDsaid for us to fail to meet this crisis would be irresponsible, and yet he just advocated failing to meet that responsibility and address the crisis. We can’t gamble with the health and well-being of women and children in this country just to serve partisan political needs, and most of the things that the Democratic leader raised in terms of objections to this conference report are just figments of his imagination. There is no mention of Planned Par-enthood in this conference report. I would challenge anybody to find Planned Parenthood mentioned once. As the Democratic leader knows, Planned Parenthood is a Medicaid pro-vider, and so Medicaid eligible individ-uals can still seek whatever services they want through Medicaid at Planned Parenthood. Then there is the Senator from Wash-ington, the top-ranking Democrat on the Appropriations subcommittee, who actually crafted the bipartisan Zika re-sponse and then walked away from it and voted against it. She said on May 26, 2016: 
Families and communities are expecting us to act. Parents are wondering if their ba-bies will be born safe and healthy. In Con-gress, we should do everything we can to tackle the virus without any further delay. Well, I agree, and I frankly do not understand how Senate Democrats, having taken this position previously, can come in here and engage in a par-tisan filibuster to stop funding for this impending public health crisis. Just last week, the senior Senator from New York said: ‘‘Every day we wait, every day is increasing the risk that we will have problems with Zika.’’ Well, today we had the chance to send a bill to the President’s desk that would meet the demands of Senator R
EID, Senator M URRAY , and Senator S
CHUMER , but they blocked it for fan-ciful and imagined reasons. One of the arguments that Senate Democrats make against the bill is that more money is needed, yet this is funded at the very level that the Sen-ate agreed to—$1.1 billion. President Obama and our Democratic colleagues repeatedly make the argument that throwing money at the problem will fix everything. Well, throwing no money at the problem will fix nothing, which is what they voted for today. Less than 7 percent—just $40 million of the $589 million transferred from the Ebola fund to fight Zika has been obli-gated as of early June. That translates to easily more than $500 million the President can still use to fight this cause in addition to the $1.1 billion in-cluded in this bill. We have heard from our colleagues on the other side of the aisle about this great need to prepare the country for this upcoming health crisis and how es-sential it is to quickly get resources to those studying the virus and working on prevention efforts and perhaps dis-covering a vaccine. But when given the chance to do that, Democrats shut it down. They filibustered the bipartisan bill that they themselves have been asking the Senate to pass, which is ab-solutely disgraceful. So I hope our colleagues on the other side of the aisle will reconsider their misguided efforts and follow through with what they have been saying we need all along—the funding to fight a real public health threat. It is a public health priority that demands our at-tention and must be addressed now and not later. Mr. President, I wonder what the Senators who voted against this bipar-tisan Zika funding bill would tell the mother of this child or perhaps another woman who is pregnant and wondering whether her child will end up with this virus and this terrible birth defect. Could they possibly look that woman in the eye and justify the reasons they have voted against funding so that other children and families can avoid this terrible devastating birth defect? I bet none of them could look that pro-spective mother in the eye and say: Well, we voted against protecting your baby and your family for good and suf-ficient reasons. As I said earlier, many of the reasons stated by the Demo-cratic leader are imagined and not real—like this idea that somehow Planned Parenthood has been targeted,

which is not even mentioned in the leg-islation. I can’t imagine a more disgraceful vote than what some of our colleagues have cast to deny funding for this im-pending public health crisis. I hope they will reconsider. I hope the fami-lies who worry about the health of their children will call their offices and say: Why did you vote against funding the money necessary to eradicate the mosquitoes that carry this disease? Why did you vote against further sci-entific research to learn how to combat it? Why did you vote against our devel-oping a vaccine that can prevent the spread of this disease not only here in the United States but around the world? I will bet none of them could look that mother in the eye because what our Democratic colleagues did today by voting down this funding was abso-lutely hypocritical, it was cynical, and it was shameful. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Vermont. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in re-sponse to the remarks of the senior Senator from Texas, I just wonder, if we had had a real conference where things were discussed, where would we be. That was impossible because the Republican leadership took the House of Representatives out of session. Had they stayed and done their work, as we are, I am sure we could have worked something out. But that, of course, was their decision. 
GENETICALLY ENGINEERED FOOD LABELING  
Mr. President, on another matter, this week marks a historic moment in Vermont. This coming Friday, July 1, Vermont’s Act 120, the first-in-the-Na-tion labeling law for genetically engi-neered—so-called GE—foods will take effect. But unfortunately for con-sumers everywhere, it could be a short- lived celebration. Late last week, a so-called deal was reached on a national mandatory label-ing law. During the weekend, I had the chance to review this proposal closely. Vermonters have reviewed it closely. I can say this: It falls short. This is an extremely complex issue— from how we define genetically engi-neered foods, to how we treat animal products; from the impact on the organics industry, to how small busi-nesses respond. It is actually not something you just talk about; the details matter here. That is why the Vermont Legislature, Republicans and Democrats working together, spent 2 years debating it. They had over 50 committee hearings featuring testimony from more than 130 representatives on all sides of the issue. The Senate has not held a single hearing on labeling. They had only one hearing on the issue of biotechnology, and they have had none on the issue of labeling foods or seeds. I would note that the proposal un-veiled late last week—and we were able to review it this weekend—is an im-provement over the legislation the Senate wisely rejected in March. That bill, the one we rejected, would con-tinue the current status quo. It pro-posed a meaningless ‘‘volunteer-only’’ approach, a thinly veiled attempt to block Vermont’s labeling law and to keep any other State from acting. This current proposal at least acknowledges that States like Vermont have enacted in this area. That is why I stayed on the floor and blocked that first bill. I thank those Senators who joined with me. We heard from the organic industry, expressing reservations about how they might be treated under a Federal GE- labeling program. Some of those con-cerns have been addressed, and the pro-posal reinforces that the USDA Or-ganic seal remains the gold standard. The proposal follows what Vermont’s Act 120 does with respect to animal products, and it addresses the gap in the Vermont law for processed foods in-spected by USDA, specifically those foods with meat. The proposal now before us also ac-knowledges at long last what I have been saying for the past year. In many rural parts of this country, including most of Vermont, we have significant technological challenges that make it nearly impossible for consumers to ac-cess the electronic or digital disclosure methods allowed in this bill. By requir-ing the Secretary of Agriculture to complete a study on this issue, I be-lieve these difficulties unavoidably will be recognized, and the Secretary should be given the authority the needs to require additional disclosure op-tions. I do hope, however, that pro-ponents of this proposal will not try to put the burden on our retail establish-ments to install costly digital scan-ners. The proponents of this deal were sent back to the drawing board after we de-railed them on March 16. As I said, I was very proud to be the Vermonter leading that effort. While it is true that this new attempt is an improve-ment in several ways, it is clear that this revised proposal is driven more by the perspectives of powerful special in-terests, than by a commitment to honor consumers’ right to know. Con-sumers’ right to know merits only grudging acceptance in this plan; con-sumers are far from this plan’s highest priority. We see evidence of that in the broad loopholes included in the defini-tions for which GE foods this proposal would apply to. While this proposal makes some posi-tive, though modest, improvements, I remain deeply concerned that it is not going to offer transparency for con-sumers. Transparency is something that many companies have already opted to provide. Look at these products. I bet most Americans can go to their cupboards and find them. Campbell’s, General Mills, Frito-Lay, Cheez-It, and the iconic Wonder Bread. All of them are already putting on their labels that they are produced with genetic engi-neering or partially produced with ge-netic engineering. It is easy. Just print it on there. Print it on there in the same way—if you have a child or a grandchild who has a peanut allergy or who requires gluten-free, you can go look for a label, and immediately, you know what you are feeding them. Thanks to the citizen-led efforts in Vermont, we are seeing more and more consumer-friendly information easily accessible to shoppers. No scanning some code. No calling an 800 number. You don’t pick up a product and say, ‘‘Gee, I have to scan a code in here’’ or ‘‘I have to call an 800 number.’’ No. You just pick up the product and look, and you find out what it has in it, every-thing from water, to celery, corn, cot-tonseed, and genetic engineered ingre-dients. We have seen countless pictures sent in by shoppers finding these la-bels. Labeling is not complicated or cost-prohibitive in practice. They are constantly printing new labels. You just add a line. Of course, to make matters worse, the bill we have before us has abso-lutely no enforcement mechanism. The negotiators of this proposal seem to think public pressure would be enough to force these multimillion-dollar cor-porations to comply. What they are saying is ‘‘You guys be the cop on the beat. You be the ones to tell them what to do.’’ Surely families squeezing every minute out of every day will not have time to hold companies accountable in the court of public opinion. Public pressure is not enough. You cannot ask consumers to go around and try to fig-ure out whether they can buy some-thing and then bring pressure. That is what we have legislatures for. At the end of the day, each of us have different reasons for wanting to know what is in our food. The fact is that, without labeling of GE foods, con-sumers cannot make informed choices. This purported deal does not go far enough to give consumers what they are asking for, which is a simple, on- package label or symbol. Of course, the bill does more than just block States from enacting GE- food labeling laws like Vermont’s Act 120; it also blocks a longstanding seed- labeling law in Vermont, one that Vermont’s organic farmers appreciate, as do conventional farmers and even backyard-hobby gardeners. This is a law that has been on the books since 2004. It ensures clear, meaningful infor-mation for farmers to know exactly what they are buying, and that is why they buy it. Perhaps in a State such as Kansas, where the last organic farm survey in 2014 counted only 83 organic farms, or Michigan, a State which is 10 times the size of Vermont and has some 332 or-ganic farms—maybe in States that don’t have organic farms, having ac-cess to that seed information is not considered useful or important, but in a State such as Vermont with only 626,000 people, where, our Northeast Or-ganic Farming Association of Vermont

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES4602 June 28, 2016 
assures me, we now have over 600 or-ganic farms, our seed-labeling law is important. The industry has complied with it the last 12 years; yet, with no hearings and no debate, this bill will block Vermont’s seed law and will pre-vent any other State from enacting one. When I was chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, I was proud that I wrote the law that set the na-tional organic standards and labeling program. I was proud of that. It started out following a discussion across the kitchen table with organic farmers in Vermont; it is now a $40 billion indus-try nationwide. I continue to closely monitor and work to protect the high standards for the organic program. They have given consumers confidence in the organic label. They have given organic pro-ducers the strong, clear, and meaning-ful standards they have demanded. They have worked hard to follow these standards, but they want to know what the standards are such that those who work hard and follow the rules are not going to have somebody come in and say, ‘‘Well, we followed the rules,’’ with no proof that they actually did. Labeling of genetically engineered products is an outgrowth of the organic movement. As a watchdog of the or-ganic program, I simply cannot support this proposal. I don’t support it. We are not saying you cannot have these ge-netically engineered foods; just let con-sumers know. Label it. Then they can decide whether to buy it, just as a par-ent with a child who may require a glu-ten-free product knows when they come in whether a product is gluten- free when it says so on the label. It doesn’t say you outlaw products with gluten in them; it says to give people a choice—the same as those with a pea-nut allergy. In this case, people want to know how their food was produced, and they want it on the label, not in some electronic code. Vermonters have a long tradition of leading the debate on issues crossing the spectrum. Vermonters stand for transparency the consumer’s right to know. Vermonters want to make in-formed decisions for their families and with their limited grocery budgets. I acknowledge—we Vermonters acknowl-edge that powerful interests are allied against Vermont’s law and against the Nation’s consumers, as has been the fact from the beginning. The proposal released last week does not respect the work that Vermont has painstakingly done in this space. This Vermonter reflects the feelings of my constituents. I will not and cannot sup-port it. Vermonters deserve better and so do all Americans. Mr. President, I see my good friend from Oregon, Senator M
ERKLEY , on the floor. He knows how important Vermont’s work has been in this na-tional public debate. I have been proud to cosponsor his legislation that recog-nizes and respects Vermont’s law. I yield to my good friend from Or-egon. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. CRUZ). The Senator from Oregon. Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ap-preciate the comments of my colleague from Vermont and the work his State has done to take on this very impor-tant issue. I wish to amplify somewhat or add to the remarks he has made. This debate is about one simple con-cept; that is, a simple, mandatory label that is consumer-friendly to inform consumers whether a product has been produced with GMO ingredients. That is it. It is the consumer’s right to know and nothing else. It has been quite an interesting jour-ney we have been on to this point. We have had the DARK Act—the Deny Americans the Right to Know Act— about the GMO status of the foods they consume, and now we have the DARK Act 2.0 coming to this floor in a decep-tive strategy to persuade Americans that we are doing something important in order to justify the preemption of our State legislators from taking on this issue State by State. Unfortu-nately, the bill before us is an echo of what we have seen before. So let’s ask the simple question: Does it meet the 1-second test for con-sumers knowing what is in their foods? That is, by the way, information 89 percent of Americans want to know. This is an issue where if you poll Democrats, Republicans, and Independ-ents, they essentially all say the same thing. Nine out of ten Americans say: We want this information on the pack-age. It is relevant to us. We think con-sumers should have the right to know. It is unusual to have an issue 9 out of 10 Democrats and 9 out of 10 Independ-ents and 9 out of 10 Republicans all agree on, but here we are at this mo-ment, with this Senate about to con-sider a bill written by and for the most powerful agricultural groups in Amer-ica to deny Americans the right to know. Let us take a closer look at what is wrong with the bill that is coming be-fore us—the Roberts bill. First of all, it does not require that simple consumer- friendly label. Instead, it says: Well, that can be an option. A company could do that, if they would like to. Well, you know what. They can do that right now, without the permission of our Federal Government. Then it says it could be an option for a company to put a symbol on a pack-age. Well, that option is there for a group right now. They can put a sym-bol on a package, if they want to. So we have granted nothing. Then it says: In lieu of putting actual informa-tion on the package, they can put a computer code on the package. A com-puter code is a square, like this, or it could be a barcode, but when you put that on the package, people say: Well, those are on the packages already. Why is it there? This bill does have a little informa-tion in it. It says: If you put this quick response code or computer code on the package, you have to say it is for addi-tional ingredient information—no ref-erence to biotechnology, no reference to GMO ingredients. It could be what version of peanuts is in the product, what version of corn, where was it raised. These are all questions a con-sumer might possibly want to know. All it says is, for more information on the ingredients. So if you look to the ingredients, and the ingredients say: tomato puree, high-fructose corn syrup and wheat flour and water, you get a little more information about those ingredients. That is what it is suggesting, even with the language in this bill that says ‘‘for more information on ingredients,’’ and nothing about the fact that this prod-uct was or wasn’t produced with bio-engineering, nothing about the fact that this product does or doesn’t con-tain genetically modified ingredients. So this is a sham because it doesn’t give that consumer-friendly informa-tion, and it is easy to give that con-sumer-friendly information. For exam-ple, let’s take a look at what is hap-pening right now on M&Ms. Here it is. The Mars corporation has said: We want to have integrity with our con-sumers so we are just going to tell them: partially produced with genetic engineering. It is a simple phrase. It meets the 1-second test. You can grab that candy bar or that bag of M&Ms, you can turn it over, and, boom, there it is, right there. That is what States have wanted to do in response to their 9 out of 10 citi-zens who desire simple information on the package. But let’s turn back. What does this bill do? This bill says compa-nies can put on a barcode with no ref-erence, no reference to the fact there are GMO ingredients. This is a com-pletely different thing. The bill also says it can put on an 800 number. We have been through this territory before too. You can put an 800 number on it. OK. That certainly is not consumer-friendly. You have to call up, wait for 20 minutes to go through a phone tree and talk to somebody on the phone. Maybe you are talking to somebody in the Philippines. Maybe they know the answer or maybe they do not. Are you kidding me? A shopper is going to go down the aisle of the gro-cery store, wanting to know the status of these different options before them, and they are going to make a call for each of them, standing there for 30 minutes, when it could have been an-swered in 1 second? No, of course not. The authors of this bill know this is a sham. This is disturbing that we are seeing DARK Act 2.0 coming back again. If you ever do get to that person on the phone line or you ever do get to that computer Web site, there is a provision in this bill that says the information on the Web site has to be on the first page, it has to be presented clearly, but it is being done by the company itself. So how big is that first page going to be, and how is it going to incorporate other information about the ingredi-ents?

This is not something being produced in a standard fashion, easy to use. Let’s realize this. In order to use the 800 number, you have to have a phone in your pocket. In order to use the barcode, you have to have a smartphone in your pocket. You have to use up your monthly digital plan. You have to expand your money to find out this information. Furthermore, some of your information is captured by the Web site when you go there. You have to give up your privacy. Again, we are seeing the sham and the scam brought forward in a new version, and that is not all. This bill has a definition that excludes the food derived from major GMO crops. I have the bill in front of me, and right up front it says what is covered. It says food that contains genetic material— that contains genetic material. Why is that important? Well, when you proc-ess crops into the ingredients that go into our food, you basically strip out, in many cases, the genetic material. Therefore, the things that are com-monly thought of as GMO ingredients wouldn’t be GMO ingredients under this bill. I have a commentary from the Food and Drug Administration, and here is what it says. It says the phrase ‘‘that contains genetic material’’ means that many foods from GE sources will not be subject to this bill, and it gives the example of genetically engineered soy—oil made from that. It goes into all kinds of products that everyone thinks of as a GMO ingredient that wouldn’t be covered. What about high-fructose corn syrup? What about oil derived from corn? Corn oil. What about sugar derived from GMO beets—the sugar that has the ge-netic material stripped from it. So in the very start of this bill, it excludes the three major crops or major compo-nents of the three major crops that are GMO in America—soybeans and corn and sugar. That is disturbing, but if that isn’t disturbing enough, another loophole has been put into this bill. Let’s turn back to what the bill actu-ally says. It says not only must it con-tain genetic material, thereby bypass-ing the soy oil and the corn oil and the sugar from the three major GMO crops, you also have to prove the ingredient ‘‘could not otherwise be obtained through conventional breeding or found in nature.’’ So all a person has to do is to assert it is possible, it could be, and then you have another massive loophole. To what point? We know it is a GMO ingredient. It is in the food. But they could say: Yes, but you could have pos-sibly developed the same thing from a non-GMO process, and they assert that so they don’t put it on their can, they don’t put it on their label. There are two major loopholes under-mining this bill, showing there is no se-rious intent to do a consumer-friendly label that justifies State preemption. I would like to say that is all, but then, as was pointed to by the Senator from Vermont, there is no enforcement in this bill. There is no authority for the USDA—U.S. Department of Agri-culture—to do a recall of products im-properly labeled. There is no enforce-ment power to exercise a fine on com-panies that fail to use some option under this bill. We can see the basic facts. This does not give a consumer-friendly label and instead sends people off through a maze, through a rat hole of telephone calls and Web sites, not in any way practical to a shopper in a store. Sec-ond, it has a definition that excludes major products from the major sources of GMO crops in America. Third, it has a huge loophole expressing the theory that if you can assert something could have been derived from a conventional breeding program, you don’t have to label. Then, fourth, no enforcement. This is completely different than the power that Vermont has under their existing bill. They have a simple 1-sec-ond test label, they have a definition that does not exclude the major crops, they do not have a loophole about some theory you could possibly have reached the same thing through conventional breeding, and they have enforcement. So this represents not even a shadow of what Vermont is doing. I have supported the idea that you could have a strong case to have a sin-gle Federal standard. It makes sense in the production of food in the country not to have different label standards in different States—the food runs through warehouses. It is spread out through different locations. Fair enough, but if you are going to take away a con-sumer-friendly label—the power to do that from a State—if you are going to preempt that, then we need to replace it with a credible, mandatory, con-sumer-friendly label at the Federal level. This bill fails the test in every major way, and that is why we should not strip States of their power. That is why we should reject this bill, and I encour-age my colleagues to do so. A con-sumer’s right to know about the food they put in their bodies is a powerful right, and we are taking it away if we pass this bill. Let us not do that. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Georgia. Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, may I inquire of the Chair, is the Senator from Connecticut due to speak next? Mr. BLUMENTHAL. I would be happy to yield to the Senator from Georgia, as long as I be permitted to follow him for up to 10 minutes. Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be recog-nized for up to 5 minutes, to be fol-lowed by Senator B
LUMENTHAL for up to 10 minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I find it unbelievable that today the United States Senate said no to pregnant moms and veterans. The vote earlier to deny cloture on the VA–MILCON legislation and the Zika virus is to say to pregnant moms in America: We don’t think the case of the Zika virus is that important; you are going to have to run the risks your-self. To say to our veterans who fought and risked their lives for us that we may not fund their health care is just not the right thing to do. I deeply regret the fact that the clo-ture motion was denied this morning. I hope that before we leave town this week, cloture will be granted so we can approve MILCON–VA appropriations and approve our response to Zika. But let me underline how important that is with two quick, brief remarks. In terms of Zika, I represent the CDC—the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention—in Atlanta, GA, the world’s health care center. I was there 2 weeks ago for a briefing on the Zika virus. There are more than 1 million Zika cases in Latin America, there are Zika cases in the Caribbean, and there are 150 in the United States of Amer-ica. The Zika virus is very unique. It attacks a pregnant mom, it attacks the child in the womb, and it attacks the brain and central nervous system, causing manifested, terrible brain problems and deformities, some that we hope we can stop and prevent. But you can’t do it if you don’t fund the Nation’s response, and the $1.1 billion in this bill, which was denied today, would go to Zika response. There are two responses we need to fund. One is the research and develop-ment for preventive vaccines so we can find them as quickly as possible. That is obviously important. But the other is the education to do the most we can to see to it that Zika is prevented wherever possible. A lot of people think that if you don’t have mosquitoes, you don’t have to worry about Zika. Zika is trans-mitted in two very distinct ways. One is through one of two types of mosqui-toes, both indigenous to my State of Georgia and most of the southeastern United States. But Zika is also trans-mitted by sexual intercourse, which means whether you are in Colorado where there are no mosquitos or Geor-gia where there are, there is another way to transmit it as well. If we don’t have a good education process in terms of how people can protect themselves against transmitting the Zika virus during sexual intercourse or protect themselves against bites by mosquitoes carrying the virus, we are going to be in big trouble. We will have a lot of ba-bies born who will have lives of tragedy because we didn’t do our jobs as U.S. Senators. It is estimated that the cost of a live birth and the lifetime of a child born with the effects of the Zika virus will be $10 million per child on the tax-payers of America—$10 million. Think of the cost that adds up to. We should come to the table imme-diately, come back, vote again, and vote for cloture on the Zika virus—the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES4604 June 28, 2016 
$1.1 billion response that passed the House—to pass the Senate and see to it that we tell the American people that we understand the dangers of Zika, and we are going to do everything we can to allow them the education they need to prevent it. We are going to respond to it, and do it in the right way. As far as the VA is concerned, I have never understood how anyone can look a veteran in the eye and say no. As chairman of the Veterans Affairs Com-mittee in the Senate, I know what these people have done. As one who served in the military, I know what sacrifice means in terms of serving in uniform. To say no to the funding of VA health care is just unconscionable, and it is wrong. Our veterans volun-teered. We don’t have a draft anymore. We don’t conscript people anymore. People volunteer. We have had 16 straight years of deployment in the Middle East of Americans who volun-teer to protect this country. They de-serve to know that when they come home, their health care is going to be provided for, their benefits are going to be provided for, and the promises we made to them to get them to volunteer to join our military are promises we keep to them, regardless of the condi-tion they may be in or the difficulties they have. So as one Member of the Senate, I can’t say no to a pregnant mom, and I can’t say no to a veteran. I don’t think anybody in here really wants to say no to them at all. I would encourage members of the Democratic Party to come back to the floor and join all of us in the Repub-lican Party to vote for cloture on the MILCON–VA and cloture on the Zika virus, and do it as soon as possible. Time is wasting. Time is of the es-sence. Time is important. Our response is important. Our pregnant moms are important. There is nobody more im-portant than the veterans of the United States of America. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Connecticut. 
PUERTO RICO  
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I strongly agree with colleagues who have supported effective, real measures to confront the spreading toll that Zika is taking around the world and, I assume, will take an even greater num-ber and magnitude in this country. But we need effective solutions that will provide funding for research, eradi-cation of mosquitoes, and education of the public without harmful restrictions that prevent women from seeking fam-ily planning services that, in fact, help to prevent the spread of Zika. Nowhere is the threat of Zika greater than in Puerto Rico. That island has been particularly hard-hit. In fact, the spreading financial crisis is combining with the spreading epidemic of Zika to create a true humanitarian crisis. That crisis will only be aggravated and deep-ened by a failure to deal effectively with the financial default that faces the island in just a few days from now. On July 1, $2 billion of loans will come due, and Puerto Rico simply lacks the resources to pay those debts. It is insolvent, so far as those debts are concerned. If the Bankruptcy Code ap-plied, it could seek relief from its creditors and prevent the race to the courthouse and the enormous litiga-tion costs and other expenses that will ensue. We have an opportunity to act on be-half of the people of the United States who have a powerfully important stake in the people of Puerto Rico and the welfare of that island. It is Americans who live there—3.5 million American citizens, who have fought in our wars, given of their culture and heritage to all of us, and have helped make Amer-ica the greatest, strongest country in the history of the world. They are American citizens who are part of the fabric of this Nation, and the people of Puerto Rico will be the ones who pay the price of a failure on our part to act effectively. The simple fact is that Puerto Rico cannot afford to pay all of its creditors and continue to provide a basic level of services for its people. That fact is un-disputed. The question is simply whether this situation is addressed in an orderly and productive way or per-mitted to enter the sea of chaos—finan-cially and in humanitarian terms—that will ensue without action on our part. Already we have seen the beginnings of this crisis. The island’s only 24/7 stroke center has closed because too many Puerto Rican neurologists have left for the mainland. The Puerto Rican Department of Education has not paid hundreds of firms that provide education and transportation services. Hospitals are barely keeping the lights on. Schools cannot pay bus drivers. My colleague from Florida, Senator NELSON , told the story yesterday of the neonatal dialysis center that is pro-viding services only to customers who can pay cash up front. Imagine, in the United States—Puerto Rico is part of the United States—children in need of lifesaving services are being turned away and denied basic health care. There is no need to guess as to what will happen on July 1. Creditors have told us—in fact, they have told us very explicitly in court papers already filed last week. They wrote: ‘‘It has long been settled law that Constitutional Debt is constitutionally required to be paid first in times of scarcity, ahead of even what government deems ‘essential services.’’’ They will claim to be paid in advance and in priority over essen-tial services. That is the stark, harsh truth of litigation, and a judgment in their favor will have lasting and irrep-arable effects on the people of Puerto Rico. If the creditors win, the people of Puerto Rico lose, and they lose tremen-dously and irreparably. The Senate has a choice. Instead of allowing a chaotic process that costs tremendously in scarce resources and benefits financially the lawyers and some of the creditors more than any-one, we can pass legislation before us today. It is not the legislation I would have preferred. In fact, this deal is not one that I find attractive. There are de-fects and weaknesses in its provisions relating to minimum wage and over-time and pensions and the structure of the board, among others. But the ques-tion is, What is the alternative? With PROMESA, the parties will have a workable judicial mechanism with a stay on litigation, ensuring that chaos is avoided and the current mess is resolved. If we devise a system that only the creditors like and works only for them, it will benefit a small group of wealthy investors that could threat-en to block Puerto Rico’s economic re-covery. In fact, the longest lasting and most alarming effect will be the uncer-tainty that results from our failure to act, which almost clearly and unavoid-ably will cause a deep recession in that island. It will, in effect, impede invest-ment in the island and quash economic recovery. Representative NYDIA VELA´ZQUEZ put it best. She has never stopped fighting for her homeland of Puerto Rico. Be-fore PROMESA passed the House she said: 
Some would have you believe that if we only yell louder, there will be a third option. But let me tell you, I have screamed so loud that I no longer have a voice. 
Like the vast majority of her House colleagues, she voted for PROMESA be-cause it is the best option available now that both sides can support. No amount of wishing or yelling will change that fact. PROMESA has the support of experts across the political spectrum and edi-torial boards across the country. It has won support from Puerto Rico’s Gov-ernor and its sole representative in the U.S. House. It has won support from business leaders in Puerto Rico and in the United States. And, crucially, the Treasury Department says it is an es-sential step—a first step—to avoid hu-manitarian catastrophe. We can come back next month, next year, or sooner to try to make it better. But there is no better bill available this week, be-fore July 1, and the impending humani-tarian crisis will most affect and most enduringly hurt the people of Puerto Rico. The choice is hope or disaster for the Americans who live in Puerto Rico. PROMESA could be better, but at the end of the day, we cannot permit the perfect to be the enemy of the good. I will continue to work for a better bill, seeking to offer amendments that im-prove it, and fighting afterward for still more improvements in this meas-ure. Today I urge my colleagues to join in supporting PROMESA. Mr. President, I yield the floor.

TRANSPORTATION, HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, AND RE-LATED AGENCIES APPROPRIA-TIONS ACT, 2016—CONFERENCE REPORT—Continued The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from West Virginia. Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in a colloquy with some of my colleagues concerning the Miners Protection Act. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. 
MINERS PROTECTION ACT  
Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, as the Presiding Officer knows very well, we have been asking for passage of the Miners Protection Act not just for our State of West Virginia but for all min-ers across America, as well as the re-tired miners who have done everything that has been asked of them. We have some of our colleagues here today. At this time, if I can—if my other colleagues will allow me—I will defer right now to Senator B
ROWN from Ohio, since he has other commitments. He will be coming back and forth. If he could go ahead and get started at this time, then I will come back and defer to our other colleague from Ohio. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Ohio. Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I know everyone is squeezed for time, but I thank Senator M
ANCHIN for his leadership, the Presiding Officer, the other Senator from West Virginia, Mrs. C
APITO , and Senator P ORTMAN , my friend from Cincinnati. We all know how serious this is. We are all willing in this body to do—at least the four of us and I know also Senator C
ASEY and Senator W ARNER — whatever it takes to get this fixed. We know we can do this for our Nation’s retired coal miners who are on the brink of losing their health care and retirement savings. This Congress can pull them back from that. The UMW health care and pension plan covers 100,000 workers, 6,800 people in Senator P
ORTMAN ’s and my State. The plans were almost completely funded before the financial collapse of almost a decade ago, but the industry’s pension funds were devastated by the recession. We know if Congress fails to act, thousands of retired miners could lose their health care this year and the en-tire plan would fall as early as 2017. For every one of those years where mine workers worked for decades and decades in the mines, they earned and contributed to their retiree health care plans and their pension plans—benefits they fought for. Their situation is similar to Senator M
ANCHIN and I, prior to—we remember what it was like here during the auto rescue, the bene-fits they fought for, benefits they gave up raises for, benefits they have earned, putting money aside, and now they have been betrayed, frankly, and that is why this is so important. We just had a meeting of a group of Senators, and Senator REIDplayed a film of what is happening in West Vir-ginia—the flooding—and much of that flooding is in miners’ country, most of it is. There were mine workers’ homes—Senator C
APITO knows this too—mine workers’ homes that were under water, as were other residents in these communities, proud communities that have done everything right, where people worked hard and played by the rules. They paid their taxes. They helped their community. They have lost so much, and this is the last thing they just simply should not lose. My contention in the Finance Com-mittee—and I know it is the contention of my colleague from Ohio too—is that committee should not do anything until we fix the miners’ pension. Sen-ator M
CCONNELL , the Republican lead-er, seems to be the only one who doesn’t want to move on this. All the rest of us do. The point a lot of us are making is, we shouldn’t allow this body—as important as I think Puerto Rico is and as much as I want to help them—we shouldn’t be voting on re-structuring Puerto Rico’s debt without lifting a finger to help our retired min-ers. I don’t want to delay Puerto Rico. I want Senator M
CCONNELL to commit to us: OK. We will move to Puerto Rico but promise a date for a vote so we can do what we need to do to move this money from the abandoned mine fund to the UMWA pension fund in a way that works for these miners, that works for the widows of miners, that works for people who are sick from working in the mines, and works for people who were injured working in the mines. As many of my colleagues know, I wear on my lapel a depiction of a ca-nary in a birdcage. All of us know in mining country, the mine workers used to take the canaries down into the mines. They had no unions in the old days to help them. They had no govern-ment that cared enough to help them. It is up to us to provide that. The ca-nary in the mine has been tweeting mercilessly, and it is time for us to step up and do what we were hired to do in these jobs. I thank Senator M
ANCHIN . Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, if I can, I will give a little background and then we will go right to Senator P
ORTMAN . I thank the Senator from Ohio. I ap-preciate it very much. The Presiding Officer understands very well. We are both from the same State, born and raised there, and tough times have always been a part of our DNA. So people know the history of the mines, as to the coal that has been pro-duced, we would not be the country we are today, we would not be the super-power of the world, if we didn’t have domestic energy in our backyard. Do-mestic energy was the coal we used to fuel the Industrial Revolution. We basi-cally defended ourselves in every war with coal. It was so important during World War II that if you were a coal miner, you would be asked to be de-ferred from fighting in the war to pro-vide the energy the country needed to defend itself. That is how important this product has been. Today it is kind of taboo to talk about it. People don’t understand we have the life we have because of it. There is a transition going on and we understand that, but, in 1946, President Harry Truman said that we can’t have the miners go on strike. John L. Lewis was going to take the miners out on strike for unfair compensation and safety reasons. Harry Truman prom-ised them if they would stay—it was so important for our economy after World War II to keep moving forward, and without the energy, we couldn’t do it. So he said: If you all will settle this strike, I will make sure everybody who produces coal—all the miners will pay into a pension fund that will guarantee that you will have health care benefits when you retire and a very meager pen-sion. We are not talking big money. We are talking very meager supplements. That was committed to and paid for. It had been funded all the way up until the greed of Wall Street in 2008, and it fell apart. Now, here we have the time. We go right up to the end of the time. Every time we go up to this timetable. Well, July 1 is Puerto Rico, and then let me tell my colleagues one thing: July 15, all the retirees will start re-ceiving notices that they will start los-ing their health care benefits within 90 days. If you have seen on television all the devastation to our State in West Vir-ginia, all the flooding, all the misery, the loss of life—one of the largest losses of life in any flooding in U.S. history. It just happened this past week in the State of West Virginia, our beautiful State. Every one of those communities you are seeing on tele-vision, with houses on fire floating down the river, with all the businesses ruined, all the homes and all the people who are left with nothing, every one of those are mining communities. Every one of them have miners living in them. Every one of them have widows who probably lost their husband to black lung depending on the health care benefits. Yet we have so many other things, and we are just asking for a vote. This is a bipartisan bill. Here we are standing on the floor, all of us, not being Democrats or Republicans, just being Americans trying to do the right thing. All we are asking for is a vote on this. It will pass. There are ways for us to pay for it so it does not cost the American taxpayers. That is what we are asking for. I don’t think that is too much to ask for. I have said let’s vote no on cloture tomorrow. I am not saying to be for or

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES4606 June 28, 2016 
against Puerto Rico. I understand the situation they are in, but unless we de-fend and fight for the people who have given us the country we have, and just disregard that, then who are we? What is our purpose for being here? With that, I yield to my good friend and colleague from Ohio, Senator P
ORTMAN . Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I thank my friend and colleague from West Virginia. I appreciate his passion for this issue. Over the years, he has fought hard for miners in every dif-ferent respect, as has his colleague from West Virginia who is in the chair right now, Senator C
APITO . They need us right now. He is absolutely right. We have a bill on the floor of the U.S. Senate that provides for essentially the bankruptcy of Puerto Rico, right? I am not being critical of that legislation. I know Puerto Rico needs help, but I also know the people I represent need help, as do the people these two Sen-ators represent and Senator B
ROWN  who spoke earlier. All we are asking for is give us a chance. We have legisla-tion that has been carefully crafted with the United Mine Workers, with the coal companies on a bipartisan basis. This is legislation that is fiscally re-sponsible. My own view, for what it is worth, is that if we don’t help now, it is very likely there could be later a need for significant funding from the taxpayers. Why? Unfortunately, be-cause we are in a situation now, where because of all these bankruptcies of all these coal companies—and we could talk about the policies toward the coal companies and the policies toward coal in this country, but the reality is, there are a lot of companies in places like Ohio and West Virginia and Vir-ginia and other States out West that are either in bankruptcy or heading to-ward bankruptcy. The people who are getting left behind are these coal min-ers who worked hard, played by the rules, have their pension, have their health care lined up, and because of the bankruptcies they find themselves on the outside. By the way, currently these mine workers’ pensions are relatively mod-est—$530 per month is the average. They are headed toward bankruptcy, by the way, within 5 to 10 years. There are 90,000 coal miners—my colleague said closer to 100,000—a little over 90,000 coal miners affected. In Ohio alone, it is over 6,000 coal miners. When that pension goes bankrupt in 5 to 10 years, there is no guarantee, as I see it, that the PBGC—that is the Pension Guaranty Benefit Corporation—is going to be there because that agency is also in trouble. So these mine workers who sacrificed so much for so long working in the mines—again, working hard, playing by the rules, helped power this Na-tion—could be left with no pensions. That is simply not acceptable. There is a further issue that some folks aren’t focused on yet but will be soon in a lot of ours States; that is, that there are about 20,000 of these re-tired coal miners who may well lose their retiree health coverage at the end of this year. So this is not down the road. This is now. This is this year. Again, these miners spent their careers in dangerous jobs. These jobs resulted in higher rates of injury, disease, can-cer, and therefore they are especially dependent on these health benefits. They have earned them. It would be devastating to those families to lose those benefits. Our solution—again, a bipartisan so-lution—Senator CAPITO is here and Senator M
ANCHIN and Senator B ROWN  and others—our solution is to have no interruption of these family health benefits, keep the pension plan solvent so it doesn’t go under, so we don’t have to have a bailout, and we can do it with a fund that is currently available. Senator M
ANCHIN spoke for a moment about how this is something that can be handled under our current fiscal sit-uation. As some of my colleagues know, I am a fiscal hawk, and I wouldn’t have signed up for this bill if I didn’t see a way to pay for it. The money would come from a miners’ health fund that is currently spending over about half of its annual alloca-tion. The fund allows for $490 million in annual spending for retired miners. Currently, it is spending closer to $225 million. So that fund is available. Our point is this: Why not use the rest of that spending authority for that fund to be able to spend the money to save the miners’ pensions and make sure they are not going to lose their health care coverage? Again, I think this solu-tion may well cost less money than simply allowing the plan to go bank-rupt, which is the other alternative, because then I think it is very likely that you would end up with a major bailout and the taxpayers would have to pick up the rest. So who are these miners? In the last several years, I have been at some of the coal mines in Ohio. I have been in aboveground coal mines and under-ground 600 feet with the coal miners. I have had an opportunity to visit three coal mines, one of them twice. Coal miners also come to a lot of my meet-ings. They come, they speak up, and they talk about why they believe they deserve to be treated fairly. They have powered this Nation. Ohio is 70-percent coal-dependent right now for electricity. Many States represented here are even higher. For some, virtually all their electricity comes from coal. It is a hard job. Again, when you are underground sev-eral hundred feet and you see the kind of work they do, you learn to appre-ciate the fact that they are taking a risk every day and they do have addi-tional health problems because of it. These are people who not only power our country, but power their commu-nities. They are engaged and involved in their communities, and they want to be sure these smaller rural commu-nities can stay vibrant. Losing that pension and losing that health care benefit obviously hurts those commu-nities. These are people who played by the rules, as I said earlier. They are pa-triotic, hardworking Americans who deserve our help right now because of this pending bankruptcy. Why on this bill? It is not about my opposition to the underlying bill, but it is about my insistence that we have a vote, and I intend not to vote to move forward with the Puerto Rico bill un-less we get our vote, and it is appro-priate. If we are going to help Puerto Rico escape bankruptcy, then we should also help the 90,000 miners we talked about in West Virginia, Ohio, and other States who are suffering the effects of these coal bankruptcies. They don’t deserve to be left behind as the Senate addresses other bank-ruptcies. Again, I want to thank my colleagues who are here. The Presiding Officer kindly took the chair so I could make these remarks. I will replace her now and have an opportunity to listen to the debate from the chair. I thank my colleagues for their willingness to stand up at this crucial time to say that this is our opportunity to be heard. That is all I am asking for. Let’s have a vote. I think if we did have a vote and all my colleagues knew the facts around this issue, I think we would be success-ful and we would be able to help a lot of these miners to get the benefits that they deserve. I yield back to my colleague. Mr. MANCHIN. I say thank you to my friend and colleague from Ohio. I thank you so much. You are absolutely correct. Of those 90,000 miners, 27,000 come from my State of West Virginia. When we talk about who are the min-ers, they are the most patriotic people you ever met. Most of them are vet-erans. They have given of themselves. They sacrifice and they will continue to do so. This country still needs a balanced energy policy that works for all of us, and they are willing to do that. They are willing to do the heavy lifting jobs they have always done. They don’t ask for a lot of accolades for doing that. I have another one of our colleagues from the great State of Indiana who knows the mining industry very well. I have been with him, and we have been out talking to them and watching how the product moves and watching how it powers this great country. With that, I yield to my friend Sen-ator D
ONNELLY from Indiana. (Mr. PORTMAN assumed the Chair.) Mr. DONNELLY. Mr. President, I thank the Presiding Officer, my col-league from Ohio, and my colleague from West Virginia. This is a critical issue. I rise today to join my colleagues in supporting the bipartisan Miners Protection Act. We are here to make sure the Federal Gov-ernment makes good on its promise of lifetime benefits for miners who risked

their lives to help our country meet its energy needs. As has been noted, President Truman and the Federal Government made a promise with the 1946 Krug-Lewis Agreement to guarantee health and pension benefits for coal miners. These workers and the generations that fol-lowed sacrificed their own long-term health and now they are depending on us to make sure they get the benefits they earned. My friend from West Virginia said that there are 27,000 miners in his State. We have 3,000 retired miners re-ceiving pension benefits and another 1,500 receiving health benefits. Many of them are in the southern part of my State. Similarly, there are tens of thousands of other retirees—90,500- plus—across the Nation in West Vir-ginia, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Illinois, and Kentucky. These retired miners and their families face a financial emer-gency unless we act now. Additionally, Congress must work to address broader problems in the multi-employer pension system, which is on the verge of crisis as well. Many plans, such as the Central States Pension Fund, which includes hundreds of thou-sands of retired Teamsters, are dan-gerously underfunded. We owe it to these hardworking Americans who did their job to do our job and to solve this problem. This is a bipartisan proposal. It isn’t about Republicans and Demo-crats. It is about Americans coming to-gether to help the 90,000-plus miners and their beneficiaries who face an im-minent loss of the benefits they have earned. They have earned these benefits. This is nothing being given to them. They have earned this everyday—walking into those mines, working nonstop and facing incredible dangers, and powering our country. We can start meeting our responsibility by scheduling a vote and passing this commonsense legislation. We made a promise to these coal miners, and we take this promise seri-ously. They did their part for decade after decade. We can’t turn our backs on them. That is not the American way. It is not the Indiana way. It is not the Ohio way. It is not the West Vir-ginia way. I urge the Senate to take up this bi-partisan Miners Protection Act as soon as possible because tens of thousands of retirees, our friends and neighbors, and our fellow Americans are counting on us to do our job and keep the word that has been given to them. I yield back. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from West Virginia. Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague from Indiana and the Senator from Ohio, the Pre-siding Officer, and my colleague from West Virginia. This is truly a bipartisan bill. As we stand before you, my colleague and I were both born and raised in West Vir-ginia. We come from different political parties, but we have been friends all our lives. The most important thing is that before we became a Republican or a Democrat, we were West Virginians first. Sometimes we might lose sight of that fact amidst all these great people in this great country. It is time for us to get together and do the right thing. These are the people who have done the heavy lifting all their lives, and all we are asking for is a commonsense piece of legislation that gives to them and protects them with a promise that we made. They worked for this. They paid into this. Their pensions were solvent. No act of their own caused this. We are not ask-ing for a bailout. There is a pay-for and a very easy pay-for. So with that, I want to recognize my colleague from West Virginia for her dedication and commitment to fight for this. I thank her so much. I yield to Senator C
APITO from our great State of West Virginia. Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I want to thank Senator M
ANCHIN , certainly for putting this colloquy together. I want to thank Senator P
ORTMAN of Ohio, Senator D
ONNELLY of Indiana, and Senator B
ROWN of Ohio. We are deeply affected by this, and the facts bear out that we can’t wait. We talk about emergencies, and what we have on the floor is the emerging bankruptcy of Puerto Rico. I think all of us have expressed deep empathy and sympathy for Puerto Rico and the situ-ation that they are in, and we appre-ciate the bipartisan effort to find a so-lution. But at the same time, we need our voices to be heard louder and clear-er. My voice is that I cannot vote for cloture on Puerto Rico when we have stranded and are stranding our hard-working coal miners and the retirees who are upcoming. You have to look at what is at stake here. We heard the numbers—21,000 Americans stand to lose their health care at the end of the year. By July 15, some are going to lose their health care in 90 days. That is way before the end of the year. You often hear the trite slogan ‘‘promises made, promises kept.’’ This was a promise that was made. This is the hard work of American coal miners who knew going in when they started to work in the mines that they were difficult and dangerous jobs. The ques-tion by the spouse was, Will my hus-band make it back today from the mines? They had a promise, and that is why a lot of them pursued and went forth in dangerous conditions to pro-vide for their families and power the country. My colleague from Ohio remarked that 70 percent of Ohio’s energy is pro-duced by coal. In our State of West Vir-ginia 95 percent is coal-produced en-ergy. We are blessed to have a lot of coal in West Virginia. That has been a good thing for a long time. Unfortu-nately, we have had a lot of issues in the coal industry, which is under as-sault from multiple directions—wheth-er it is regulation, increased competi-tion, the effects of a broader economy. All kinds of things are flying into this, but the reality is where we are today. We mentioned the numbers. Of 12,000 Americans who could lose their health care, 5,000 of those are our fellow West Virginians. I can guarantee you that between the two of us, we know quite a few them. We live in a small State. We live in a community where everybody knows everybody. I tell you one thing, to divert from this to what has hap-pened to our State with the floods. I am sure other States do this just as well, but I don’t think there is a State that does better than West Virginians helping West Virginians. What we have seen over the last few days with neigh-bors helping neighbors and people pull-ing up each other and pulling together is phenomenal. A lot of those folks are not coal mining families. They know coal mining families. They go to church with their families. Their kids go to school together. Their grand-children play together. We are all con-nected together. You look at the health care and pen-sions of 27,000 West Virginians. As was mentioned, these are not large amounts. I think the Senator from Ohio mentioned $560 a month. Unfortu-nately, for some retirees that is the difference between paying their elec-tricity bill and having food on the table. That is a substantial amount. It could mean getting gas for the car, buying their medicines, or helping their children when they might need help to purchase a new pair of shoes. All of these kinds of things are ex-tremely important in the everyday life of our retirees. I think the best voices are the voices of the miners. I have received letters, and I am sure you all have received let-ters and talked to folks yourself, from people like Rita from Ieager, WV, who wrote that her husband started work as a coal miner 40 years ago right out of high school. Without the act, she and her husband will lose their entire health care coverage. Walter is a third generation coal miner. We find these a lot. A lot of these people are third and fourth gen-eration coal miners. He is from Danville and began working in the mines when he was still in high school. He wrote to express concern not just for himself. As a typical West Vir-ginian and hardworking American, he is worried about his friends and former colleagues in Boone County. There are people like Teresa, also from Boone County, whose husband worked in the mines for 36 years and planned for re-tirement knowing that they would re-ceive the health care and pension bene-fits they were promised. She asks us to ‘‘please help these retirees to ensure that people like my husband keep the benefits he was promised and that he earned and worked hard for.’’ There is Ralph from Morgantown, who reminds us—and I think this is es-pecially important for us to reempha-size today—that ‘‘Congress has the

power to keep that promise because it is the right thing to do to protect those hardworking Americans.’’ Ralph is right. So I am going to make a stand with my colleagues. I am asking in a loud and joint voice to have this vote to keep the promise that was made. While Puerto Rico is facing a finan-cial crisis and I have great empathy for what is going on there, I cannot vote for cloture on the Puerto Rico bill until I get some certainty that we are going to move in a positive direction. I appreciate the passion and the willing-ness of Senator M
ANCHIN to join us to-gether in this colloquy today. We have bipartisanship. We have a regional coa-lition that I think we can build on every day. I hope we will be successful so that we can make sure that our min-ers and their families have the assur-ances, the security, and the faith in us who could make that decision, and the faith in this country that made that promise. I yield back to the Senator. Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, some people say this is a union versus a non-union issue. That is not the case at all. In 1946, anybody who was mining coal was a member of the United Mine Workers of America, almost 99.9 per-cent. With that type of participation, having all these people involved—that is the deal that was made. That is the deal Harry Truman, the President of our United States of America, made with John L. Lewis. You have to con-tinue to mine the coal that keeps the country running. Today, coal has been villainized to the point where people think they don’t need it, they don’t like it, they don’t want it, and it is no good for them. Well, guess what. The coal we use today is cleaner and used cleaner than ever before. We keep talking about the global cli-mate. I am not a denier. With 7 billion people, I think we have a responsi-bility. We have a responsibility to clean up the environment. We have done it, and we can do a lot more in America. We can lead the rest of the world—which burns over 7 billion tons of coal—to do it much cleaner if we are serious about it and if we don’t just continue to demonize it here in Amer-ica, its use in America, putting all these people out of work. My colleague talked about Puerto Rico and its finances. We have sym-pathy and compassion for anybody who has had difficult times. But we have people who basically gave their sweat, their blood, and their lives for the en-ergy of this country, and their widows and other people are depending on that retirement and they are depending on their health care benefits. Let me tell you the domino effect that will happen. The domino effect is this: If these health care benefits go by the wayside, a lot of the clinics that take care of people throughout West Virginia, throughout the coal industry, through-out the coal counties all across Amer-ica, are going to be hurting. They are going to be hurting as they try to keep their doors open to take care of the children, the families, the widows—the people who are depending upon them. This has a ripple effect that people don’t really consider. All we are asking of the majority leader, our majority leader—I am re-spectfully asking him—he comes from the State of Kentucky, and he under-stands the people of mining. In a com-passionate way, I am asking if he would just consider giving us the vote before we leave here. That is why we are not voting on the Puerto Rico cloture. We have basically next week, and after next week we will be gone for quite a while. These widows and all these retirees will start receiv-ing their notices July 15. We will be out of here on the 16th. What do we tell them? Well, I am sorry we are on vaca-tion. We have all gone home. We all gave up. The House is gone now. They got in so much conflict, they couldn’t take it anymore. They left early. They are not coming back. This is a shame. It is ab-solutely a shame. I am almost ashamed to tell—people say: Where do you work? I say: Oh, I work for the government in Washington. I will be almost afraid to tell them what body I am in if we can’t do better than we are doing. I am getting so sick and tired of ‘‘If you are a Republican and I am a Demo-crat, I am supposed to be against you.’’ I am not against you; I am with you. I am with this country. I want America to do well. I want the whole world to be envious that we can help other people. But if we can’t take care of ourselves, if we can’t help the people we have committed to and made a promise to, then why should anyone? Why should anyone look to America? We are the hope of the world. Well, if we are going to be the hope of the world, we better take care of the people who gave us the country we have; that is, the mine workers of this country, the United Mine Workers of America— the toughest people I have ever been around, the most generous people I have ever been around, and the most compassionate people I have ever been around. It is our responsibility, Mr. President and my colleagues, to keep our promise to the miners who have answered the call whenever their country needed them. When our country went to war, the miners stayed there and powered us to prosperity. When our economy was stagnant, these miners fueled its growth and expansion. They kept their promise to us, and now it is time for us to do the same. We must keep our promise of a lifetime pension and health benefits to our miners—some-thing they paid for, something they worked for—for their dedication to our country. That is why I am calling for the immediate passage of the Miners Protection Act. I appreciate my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. This is truly a bipar-tisan effort. I thank the Presiding Offi-cer. I thank each and every one of you. Please talk to colleagues, as we do with all our friends on both sides, and do the right thing and pass the Miners Protection Act. Mr. President, I yield the floor. FAMILY PLANNING SERVICES  
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, earlier today the Senate held a cloture vote on the conference report to accompany H.R. 2577, a bill that would fund mili-tary construction and veterans pro-grams in fiscal year 2017 and provide $1.1 billion to respond to the Zika pub-lic health crisis. There has been a great deal of misin-formation on what the bill would do and which organizations and providers would be eligible to receive funding under the bill. I would like to ask a question of the chairman of the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Edu-cation Appropriations Subcommittee, who helped to write the Zika funding package. Is it accurate to say that family planning service providers that receive Medicaid reimbursement would be eli-gible to be reimbursed for family plan-ning services through funding provided in this bill? Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, that is accurate. Let me be clear, the con-ference report provides the same access to birth control services as the admin-istration’s request by allowing reim-bursement through public health plans, which includes Medicaid. In addition, the conference agreement goes even further than the administration’s re-quest by expanding access to services through more robust funding to com-munity health centers, public health departments, and hospitals in areas most affected by the Zika virus. Mr. MANCHIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. L
ANKFORD ). Without objection, it is so ordered.

THEIR LIVES IN COMBAT

SERGEANT JOSHUA ROBINSON  
Today I reflect upon the life of Ma-rine Sgt Joshua Robinson of Hastings, NE. Josh grew up on a farm near the small village of Oak, NE. As a boy, he thrived in the outdoors. Many would say he was born to be a marine. Josh

loved hunting, fishing, and preparing animals for 4–H competitions. He first learned to shoot with a Red Ryder BB gun and became excellent at tracking wild animals. Later, the Robinson family moved to Colorado, where Josh grew into an im-pressive athlete. He discovered water sports. Water skiing, wakeboarding, and kneeboarding became his passions. By high school, this natural ability was generating success on the wres-tling team, and he would later rep-resent them three times at the State championships. In 2000, Josh’s high school graduation coincided with his family’s return to Nebraska, where he enrolled at Metro Community College in Omaha. His ath-letic ability was on full display here, too, this time riding bulls in the rodeo. Over a year after graduating high school, Josh would find a new mission. On September 11, 2001, terrorist at-tacks on our homeland changed the world and instilled a deep sense of duty and patriotism for Josh. Like so many others in the days that followed, he an-swered the call to military service. His mother Misi remembers his passion during that time, saying: 
Our freedom was put on the line. It takes young men like Josh to enlist and protect the USA. 
By 2003, Josh had enlisted in the Ma-rine Corps. That year, he also met the love of his life, Rhonda Zaruba of Bennington, NE. They connected im-mediately and were engaged shortly after Josh returned from basic training in 2004. Rhonda recalls the advice Josh’s marine friends gave him at the time: Never buy a truck, and never get married. In 2004, he did both. Josh and Rhonda were married in Omaha later that year. They grew in love and had two sons—Kodiak, who is now 10; and Wyatt, now 9. Together, Josh and Rhonda navigated their family through Josh’s two deployments to Iraq. Like so many military families, they en-dured the pain of separation on birth-days, anniversaries, and holidays. His service was their service. No one was surprised by Josh’s suc-cess in the military. His mother says Josh took the skills he learned as a boy in Nebraska and he placed them in the service of his Marine Corps brothers. As a soldier, he taught courses in tracking and mountain survival. As a scout sniper with the 1st Marine Divi-sion, he taught high-angle shooting and mountain survival at California’s Mountain Warfare Training Center. Josh taught his marines, and he also nurtured his sons. He showed Kodiak and Wyatt how to identify different animal tracks, and by a very young age, both boys were masters. They still remember how to read raccoon and deer tracks. Josh’s fellow marines, who referred to Sergeant Robinson as ‘‘Robbie,’’ say he was fearless. Through extraordinary survival skills, Josh kept his men alert and safe. As fellow marine LCpl Gavin Bristol put it: I never had any doubt there was a better man looking out for us . . . Whenever we felt fear or anxiety, we just had to remember that ‘‘Robbie’’ was with us. 
Josh was an infantryman assigned to the 1st Battalion, 5th Marine Regi-ment, 1st Marine Division, based out of Camp Pendleton, CA. After serving two tours in Iraq, he was deployed to the Helmand Province, Afghanistan, in March of 2011. At this time, Helmand Province was the most dangerous re-gion in Afghanistan and the last hold-out for the Taliban. A few months later, on June 11, a fire fight broke out, lasting 6 hours. During the attack, Josh rescued a wounded marine while leading his combat team to safety. He would later earn the Bronze Star for his actions that day. Two months later, on August 7, 2011, Josh was out on patrol and was shot twice by an enemy combatant. He died shortly after. Sgt Josh Robinson was flown to Nebraska and laid to rest on August 12, 2011, in Hastings. Saint Cecilia’s Church was filled for the fu-neral service, and hundreds of Patriot Guard riders led his procession. Fellow marine Lance Corporal Bristol often thinks of Josh, saying: 
Every day I was able to walk alongside Sergeant Robinson was a gift. He can never be replaced as a Marine, a leader, or a friend. 
To his wife Rhonda, he was a ‘‘man’s man’’ and an ‘‘amazing Marine broth-er.’’ He took new marines under his wing, and he would bring them home to meet Rhonda and their children. Josh’s sons Kodiak and Wyatt will remember motorcycle rides with their dad. They will cherish memories of him teaching them how to ride the mechan-ical bull and the snow ski. Nebraskans will remember Joshua Robinson for what he embodied and what it means to be one of the few, the proud—a marine. Sgt Joshua Robinson earned the Pur-ple Heart, the Combat Action Ribbon, and was posthumously awarded the Bronze Star. He lived his life the way he served his country—with distinction and with great honor. Sgt Joshua Robinson is a hero, and I am honored to tell his story. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. 
PROMESA  
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I come to the floor, as I have many times over the last nearly half a year, to talk about the challenges the people of Puerto Rico have. I came to the floor last week to ask consent to bring to the floor the bill that the House of Representatives called PROMESA— which, in Spanish, means ‘‘promise’’ but is anything but a promise to the challenges the people of Puerto Rico have—because I knew we needed time to be able to make a horrible bill a lot better. That is the essence of what the Senate is. It is a coequal branch of the legislative body that does not have to accept what the House of Representa-tives sends and say, well, it is an up-or- down vote. I had been speaking for some time about what I expected was going to happen. At that time, the ma-jority whip—Senator CORNYN , the dis-tinguished Senator from Texas—got up and objected to my unanimous consent request but said there will be an oppor-tunity for amendments. Obviously, the majority leader put the legislation on the table, filled the tree, and now there is no opportunity for amendments. I think the 3.5 million U.S. citizens who call Puerto Rico home deserve more than being jammed in a legisla-tive process where their lives and their futures are going to be dictated to for some time by a control board—and I will talk about that at length—by a control board for which there are no elected representatives from Puerto Rico, no one whom the Governor and Legislature of Puerto Rico get to name on behalf of the 3.5 million citizens and who can determine just about every facet of their life. Yet there cannot be a simple amendment here. The citizens of Puerto Rico are citi-zens. They deserve to be treated as citi-zens, not servants. They deserve to be treated in a way that beholds a history of proud service to the Nation. They deserve to be treated as citizens, not subjects—not subjects. If all we can do for the people of Puerto Rico is have a very prolonged understanding of what this legislation will do to the people of Puerto Rico, then that is what I intend to do. I would let my colleagues know I intend to be here for some time to talk about this legislation, that it is not a promise, the consequences to the people of Puerto Rico, and to hopefully get my colleagues to understand there is another pathway, which is not to in-voke cloture, therefore giving us the wherewithal to have amendments to make the legislation achieve its stated promise, which the goal is to ulti-mately give a pathway to the restruc-turing of Puerto Rico’s $70 billion in debt under the Bankruptcy Code. The only reason to consider any legislation at all is to find a way to give Puerto Rico the opportunity to achieve a path-way to restructuring its debt under the Bankruptcy Code. They had elements of that ability in the law before. Somehow, in the dark of night, someone or some entity went ahead and included in legislation the taking away of powers they had of hav-ing some element of access to the Bankruptcy Code. No one can find the legislative history of why that hap-pened to the Government of Puerto Rico, but it did. The only reason to consider legislation in the first place is to have a clear pathway to restruc-turing so the enormous challenges the people of Puerto Rico are facing can be

alleviated and there can be a better fu-ture, but that is not what this legisla-tion does. I will talk at length about what the legislation does and does not do, but the essence of what I want to show is the reasons this bill is simply not acceptable. They, meaning this control board which is appointed—remember, again, two members by the Speaker of the House, two members by the Senate ma-jority leader, one by the Senate minor-ity leader, one by the House minority leader, and one by the President; there-fore, four Republican appointments and three Democratic appointments, of which only one has to have their prin-cipal domicile or business on the island of Puerto Rico. That person could have their primary business in Puerto Rico but not live in Puerto Rico, and there would be no say on behalf of Puerto Rico’s elected leadership and no say on behalf of the 3.5 million people on the island about how their future will be dictated. Yet this control board that makes the ultimate decisions on so many crit-ical elements—including the very es-sence of why we are having legislation in the first place, which is to create a pathway toward restructuring—the legislation says: ‘‘The Oversight Board may certify a plan of adjustment only if it determines, in its sole discretion. . . . ’’ This phrase, ‘‘in its sole discre-tion,’’ will appear nearly 30 times throughout the legislation we are going to be voting on, and I have read the legislation fully at least twice, from cover to cover, and nearly 30 times, in critical elements about crit-ical decisions the control board will have over the people of Puerto Rico, we don’t even define what the parameters are. We say: in the control board’s sole discretion. That is an incredible grant of power, ‘‘in its sole discretion, that it is consistent with the applicable cer-tified Fiscal Plan.’’ They have the discretion to grant or deny restructuring. There are a whole series of hurdles we will talk about as to what is necessary for them to even grant that determination, which is in their sole discretion. They may never get to the point they feel Puerto Rico should have access to restructuring, which is the only reason we are even considering legislation, because they are supposed to have access to restruc-turing. By the way, that control board—non-elected, sole discretion, only one per-son from the island of Puerto Rico, ei-ther their business or their residence is going to be represented there—neither the Governor nor the legislature may exercise any control, any supervision, any oversight, or any review over the control board or its activities. That control board of seven members needs what to get to a restructuring? It doesn’t need a majority vote. It needs a supermajority vote, so instead of four out of the seven ultimately saying to Puerto Rico: All right. You met the standards we set. You can go to re-structuring now and get access to the bankruptcy process—which, by the way, would be determined by a bank-ruptcy court under the normal process. When you go for restructuring, you go to a bankruptcy court, and the judges or judge assigned the case will make those determinations. Obviously, restructuring is not a tax-payer bailout because restructuring is to take the debts that exist and re-structure them in such a way they can make payments and at the same time deal with essential services for the 3.5 million U.S. citizens who call Puerto Rico their home. No, it is not a bailout, but even to get to that restructuring, guess what, you don’t need four out of seven, a simple majority. We grow up— I see our pages here—we grow up learn-ing that majority rules, but, no, not for the 3.5 million people of Puerto Rico. We will say a supermajority has to vote, which means five of the seven have to vote to allow restructuring to take place. What does that mean? It means a mi-nority, three of those seven members, could forever not allow Puerto Rico to get access to restructuring. When did that become the process in which a mi-nority can make such a determination, an unelected minority can make such a determination to affect the lives of 3.5 million people, and instead of a major-ity view, it is a minority view? It is a pretty amazing extension of power. I see my colleague is on the floor. I would be happy to yield for a question without losing my right to the floor. Mr. SANDERS. Yes. Mr. MENENDEZ. If the Senator has a question. Mr. SANDERS. I have a question. It is a long question, but I certainly want my friend from New Jersey to respond to that question. I ask my colleague from New Jersey, is this legislation smacking of the worst form of colonialism, in the sense that it takes away all of the important democratic rights of the American citi-zens of Puerto Rico? Basically, four Re-publicans, who likely believe in strong austerity programs, will essentially be running that island for the indefinite future. Would my friend from New Jer-sey agree this is colonialism at its worst? Mr. MENENDEZ. Absolutely. The Senator from Vermont is right. I have called this legislation the ultimate neocolonialism we as a Congress would be passing. It treats the citizens of Puerto Rico like subjects, not citizens. It doesn’t allow them to have a voice. They get no one on the control board. Yet the control board can dictate budg-ets. It can dictate budget cuts. It can dictate what is or is not sufficient for the running of essential services. It will dictate whether the pensions get treated fairly. My colleague is correct. Mr. SANDERS. I ask my friend from New Jersey—there is a very strong dif-ference of opinion in the Senate and in the House about economic issues. Many of our Republican friends think trick-le-down economics—giving tax breaks to the wealthy, cutting Social Secu-rity, cutting Medicare, cutting Med-icaid, cutting education—is the way they would like to see our country move forward. Does my friend from New Jersey have any doubt, if you have a financial control board dominated by four Republicans, that is exactly the type of philosophy that will be imposed on the people of Puerto Rico? Mr. MENENDEZ. My colleague from Vermont is onto something. One of the things the control board can actually do is set the budget for Puerto Rico. As you and I both know—you have been on the Budget Committee for some time— probably the most significant things Members of Congress can set is a budg-et, which is a reflection of our prior-ities, right? How much do we believe we should spend on education, on health care? How do we provide tax breaks so students don’t graduate under a mountain of debt—something my distinguished colleague has made a major issue in his Presidential cam-paign. How do we ensure we give tax breaks, such as the earned-income tax credit which the people of Puerto Rico don’t get access to. The budget sets a series of standards. The control board will set that budget. If it wants to view austerity as its fiscal idea as to how you achieve prosperity—prosperity through austerity—it will be able to do that. I think the Senator is right. An example of that is when there are pro-visions included that really have no place in a bill for restructuring, that talk about eliminating the minimum- wage guarantees for certain parts of the Puerto Rican society and elimi-nating overtime protections. I am sure the Senator from Vermont is concerned about those. Mr. SANDERS. I am. Let me ask the Senator from New Jersey, a significant part of Puerto Rico’s $70 billion debt has been acquired in recent years by vulture funds. These are folks who pur-chase bonds for as little as 29 cents on the dollar and who get interest rates of up to 34 percent. I believe something like one-third—I may be wrong on this, but I believe about one-third of the debt of Puerto Rico is now controlled by these vulture funds. People who buy, by definition, ‘‘risky bonds’’ but now want to get 100 percent on the dol-lar, despite the fact that they paid a fraction of what the bond is worth— from a moral perspective, should the U.S. Senate be supporting legislation which allows vulture capitalists, some of whom are billionaires, to make huge profits while at the same time nutri-tion programs and educational pro-grams for low-income children in Puer-to Rico are cut? Does that sound like the kind of morality that should be passed in the U.S. Senate? Mr. MENENDEZ. My colleague is right. It is a real concern in the legisla-tion as it appears. It says here, to read to my colleague: ‘‘The Oversight Board shall determine in its sole discretion whether each proposed Budget is com-pliant with the applicable fiscal plan.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4611 June 28, 2016 
There are other sections here, to go to the Senator’s particular question, which say: Before the board ever con-siders—if it ever does—access to re-structuring, it is going to, in essence, if you read the language, not only urge but it is going to judge as to whether Puerto Rico worked out a deal with its creditors, including the vulture funds. It can hold Puerto Rico to such a standard in its sole discretion because we don’t define in the legislation what is the standard of a reasonable attempt to compromise with your creditors. That is fine, a reasonable attempt to compromise with your creditors, but if your creditors believe they have you by the neck and they want to continue to squeeze and they believe there is a con-trol board that is going to back them up and allow you to squeeze, and every time Puerto Rico comes to the Gov-ernor of Puerto Rico, who has no vote or say here, except to recommend— comes to the control board and says: Guess what. We have tried and tried, and we have negotiated in good faith with these creditors, including vulture funds, but we can’t come to an agree-ment because they want too much, and we have to provide police services, fire service, education, and health care. I mean, here is an island—part of the United States as a Commonwealth, with 3.5 million U.S. citizens—which ultimately is at the epicenter of the Zika virus and its challenge and yet they can continually be forced to deal with their creditors in such a way that the concern my colleague has might actually be materialized by the board itself. Mr. SANDERS. Let me add another point to that very discussion, which I have a hard time understanding and maybe my friend from New Jersey can educate me on this. As I understand, in this bill, there is a requirement that Puerto Rico, a territory that has been experiencing a 10-year depression, a territory in which over half of the chil-dren are living in poverty, a territory in which many schools have been shut down, where people have been laid off, where unemployment is sky high, that within this legislation, there is the im-position that the people of Puerto Rico are going to have to pay for this con-trol board to the tune—and I don’t un-derstand this—of $370 million. You have a board of seven people. No. 1, how in God’s Name do you run up an administrative cost of $370 million? Yes, you need staff and you need all that stuff, but $370 million to run a small bureaucracy sounds to be totally off the charts. Then, to tell the people of Puerto Rico, you are going to have to shut down schools, you are going to have to shut down health services, we may take away the pensions of your workers, and, oh, by the way, you are going to have to pay $370 million in order to fund this control board—am I missing anything here? I know this sounds so absurd that people may think I am misleading them, but am I missing anything here or is that the re-ality? Mr. MENENDEZ. No, the Senator is right. Not only is it $370 million, but the legislation specifically says Puerto Rico must have a dedicated source of funding. We know what this means in this institution, a dedicated source of funding. That means a guarantee of that money. There must be a dedicated source of funding to pay the $370 mil-lion for the seven-member board and whatever staff, in their sole discretion, they decide to hire. Mr. SANDERS. So it means, or it certainly could mean, the closing down of schools, nutrition programs, and health care in order to fund—and I can-not for the life of me understand how a seven-member committee can spend $370 million, but this will be taking away perhaps basic needs from hungry kids in order to maintain what seems to me an extraordinary bureaucracy. With that, I thank the Senator from New Jersey for his leadership, and I look forward to working with him. Mr. MENENDEZ. I thank the Senator for his concern and his points. Mr. President, I have come to the floor time and time again with a sim-ple message: PROMESA, the name of this legislation, which means ‘‘prom-ise’’ in Spanish, is not a promise. It is a power play, leaving the people of Puerto Rico unable to manage their own government, make their own deci-sions, do what they believe is right. I have been concerned exactly about this, and I have my remarks going back to September 22, 2015, when I started off those remarks by saying, ‘‘I rise today deeply concerned that the growing economic crisis in Puerto Rico threatens to destabilize the island, and that we must [step in] and help our fel-low American citizens before the finan-cial crisis becomes a calamity.’’ Sep-tember 22, 2015. I talked about the fact that if you do not act, the results of a financial dis-order would be much more expensive, much more chaotic both in the long term and the short term, would cost Puerto Rico and the United States, and the fact is that a potential solution rests in the hands of the administra-tion with Treasury and HHS. I talked about legislation that we in-troduced at that time, along with some of our colleagues, that would allow the government of Puerto Rico to author-ize its public utilities to rework their debts under chapter 9. We also talked about the fact that even though Puerto Rico pays about a third or so of every dollar that they get in revenue towards interest, which is unsustainable, that but for those inter-est payments, they would actually be running a surplus—a surplus—if they didn’t have debt payments. We talked about an effort that was supported by the nonpartisan National Bankruptcy Conference and numerous bankruptcy lawyers and judges to help the people of Puerto Rico. That was in September of 2015, well in advance of the crisis that has now been created, where we have brought legislation for an up-or-down vote on the Senate floor in June, on the verge of the Fourth of July recess—an up-or-down process with all of the challenges that this leg-islation has for the people in Puerto Rico. At that time, I talked about the is-land’s health care system adding addi-tional pressure to the overall financial system and about the way in which we fund those health programs—Medicare, Medicaid. How we treat them as it re-lates to U.S. citizens living in Puerto Rico is different, part of which has been their challenge. Then I came back to the floor in De-cember of 2015 to once again speak about the urgency of the moment and to give us the time to think intel-ligently about how we help the people of Puerto Rico meet their challenge and at the same time be able to do it in such a way that respects their rights as citizens of the United States. I came to the floor on December 9 of 2015 to ask unanimous consent to pur-sue a proposal we thought was rather modest. There were four things we needed for the citizens of Puerto Rico, and for Puerto Rico to have access to the Bankruptcy Code, restoring certain elements of that, which, of course, would not cost the Treasury a penny, nor would it raise the deficit. We tried to get a focus then—because already at that time there were serious financial issues on the island—and we had an ob-jection by the chairman of the Finance Committee saying that there were ne-gotiations underway to come to an agreement. That was December 9, 2015. Then in March of 2016, we introduced legislation that I think would be a far greater set of circumstances, enabling the people of Puerto Rico to see a fu-ture but a future they would help de-termine. Yes, it had overtures of an oversight board—but not a control board that controls their destiny—with a greater representation under certain standards of people’s abilities that would ultimately be brought to serve on the board. I thought that legislation created the right structure; created a true over-sight—not control—board; created standards that are clear and concise and that the people of Puerto Rico and its government officials would know— ‘‘This is what I must do in order to achieve a pathway to restructuring’’— and that represented the people of Puerto Rico, as well as the leaders of the Congress, and that gave us an op-portunity to ensure that any restruc-turing plan was based on an objective and independent analysis of the is-land’s situation and provided assur-ances to creditors that future govern-ments would adhere to a prudent, long- term fiscal plan, while reaffirming and representing and respecting Puerto Rico’s sovereignty. That was in March of this year. Then in April we had a press con-ference to try to bring forth the con-sequences of the need to act at that time—April 28 of 2016.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES4612 June 28, 2016 
Then I came to the floor again on May 24 of 2016 to talk about the chal-lenges that the people of Puerto Rico are facing and to have an informed, in-telligent debate and process to get to the type of legislation that would both solve the problem and meet their needs. So that continues all the way through June of this year. To me, as someone who started in September of last year to raise the alarm bells—and not only to do that but to then come up with a legislative proposal that was embraced by all of the elected leader-ship of Puerto Rico, by all of the major parties in Puerto Rico, by the members of their legislature, the Governor and others who all put out statements say-ing that this was a pathway that would respect the citizens of Puerto Rico and give them the tools they need to re-structure their debt, become fiscally responsible, and realize the hopes and aspirations of the people of Puerto Rico. So I not only raised the alarm bells as of September of last year, I created a legislative solution for it so that we could have an informed debate. What do we have in the greatest de-liberative body in the world? We have legislation drafted in the House, for which there is no opportunity to do what the majority leader said he want-ed this Congress and the Senate to do more often—to have a full debate and a full airing of amendments in such a way that the voices of the American people, as represented by the Members of the Senate, could speak. So my hope is that over the next pe-riod of time, we are going to have a full display for our colleagues to under-stand what they will be voting on when it comes to cloture so that when they vote, they vote with open arms. The people of Puerto Rico, unable to manage their own government, make their own decisions under this bill— that is what those who vote for it be-lieve is right. We have heard the words of ‘‘Invictus’’: ‘‘I am a master of my fate. I am the captain of my soul.’’ But that apparently doesn’t apply to the 3.5 million American citizens in Puerto Rico who have helped shape the history of this Nation, and I will talk about that at quite some length. We have heard the words of Jack Welch, who said: ‘‘Control your own destiny or someone else will.’’ Well, ap-parently our Republican colleagues be-lieve in the case of Puerto Rico that someone else should, that those 3.5 mil-lion citizens should not be part of de-termining their own future. They be-lieve in an unelected control board that can rule with an iron fist, as they see fit, regardless of what the Puerto Rican people would want. Thomas Jefferson said: ‘‘I know of no safe depository of the ultimate powers of the society but the people them-selves.’’ I have heard many of my friends here on the other side quote some of the Founding Fathers, including Jefferson. He said: I know of no safe depository of the ulti-mate powers of the society but the people themselves. And if we think them not en-lightened enough to exercise their control with the ultimate discretion, the remedy is not to take it from them, but to inform their discretion. 
But in the case of Puerto Rico, we have decided not to help them make their own decisions but to take powers away from the society, as Jefferson spoke of, powers away from the 3.5 mil-lion U.S. citizens who call Puerto Rico their home—away from them. So that is what is at the heart of this debate about PROMESA, which doesn’t really guarantee a pathway to restruc-turing, which subjugates the people of Puerto Rico to a control board on which they have no direct representa-tion, and they will have to live with the consequences of the fiscal dictates the control board will have edict over in their sole discretion. Yet, who has to live with it and who has to pay for it, as the conversation with Senator S
ANDERS revealed? They will. They have to pay the $370 million; they have to have a dedicated source of revenue for it. By the way, this control board—we will talk a little bit more about that later—has no limits as to how long it is going to exist. It says in the first in-stance 5 years, but then it says again, in its sole discretion, when it deter-mines that Puerto Rico has reached a standard by which they are fiscally on the right path and have access to the bond markets. But that discretion will be totally controlled by the control board in their sole discretion, so they could extend their life for quite some period of time. So in the spirit of making sure that the 3.5 million U.S. citizens of Puerto Rico have an opportunity for a better path and a real promise, I have many amendments to offer, many amend-ments that in the aggregate would show my colleagues what we might have done, what we could have done, and what we still can do by voting against cloture, what reasonable mid-dle ground we could have reached to truly help solve the crisis and the hu-manitarian catastrophe that awaits the people of Puerto Rico rather than simply ignore the right of their will and choose the road to colonialism. I would note that calls for a thorough debate on the Senate floor are bipar-tisan in nature. I thank my colleague Senator W
ICKER for joining me in a let-ter to the leadership asking for a full and open process to consider this bill with amendments—as many as it will take to make it right. I would remind my colleagues that each one of us was elected to this very Chamber to debate and enact legisla-tion, to improve the lives of Ameri-cans, and the people of Puerto Rico are Americans. I emphasize that fact. Sometimes I have heard in my con-gressional career between the House and the Senate—some people ask me about—I had Members of the House, when I served in the other body, who would come to me and say: Do I need a passport to go to Puerto Rico? And I would look at them, and I thought they were jesting, but they were serious. The people of Puerto Rico are U.S. citi-zens. They have worn the uniform of the United States. They have shed blood. They have died. They love this country greatly. By the way, one plane flight to anywhere in the United States, and they have all the full rights, privileges, and obligations as any other citizen of the United States, which means that the human capital flight we are seeing taking place in Puerto Rico is a great flight because people, seeing there is no future for them, will ultimately leave. But I fear that instead of a robust de-bate and thoughtful consideration of amendments to improve this bill, those who want to see the House bill signed into law as drafted have delayed and delayed and delayed until the last pos-sible minute. We can, as U.S. Senators, change that course of events. I understand that sometimes the deck is stacked against you, but I also believe that you can reshuffle the deck, that there is the power of individual Members of the Senate to ultimately say: We need a pathway that allows us to improve the legislation and to improve the lives of the 3.5 million U.S. citizens who call Puerto Rico home. How can we as U.S. Senators shirk our responsibilities when the people of Puerto Rico are at the edge of a great challenge and yet we don’t want them to have a say as to how they meet that challenge? They need our help, and they need it today. This bill will affect a generation—a generation—of Puerto Ricans, and we owe it to them, as we would our broth-ers and sisters who live in our States, to get it right. So let me once again remind every one of my colleagues how deeply poor this legislation is and how incomplete it is. In addition to the undemocratic control board and obfuscated path to restructuring, the bill would actually increase poverty and out-migration rather than stem both. That is because it provides an exception to the Federal minimum wage for younger workers, and it exempts the island from recently finalized overtime protections. What does that have to do with a bill to allow restructuring so that Puerto Rico can restructure its debt, not pay over a third of every dollar that it takes in to creditors, and be able to deal with the health, well-being, edu-cation, and future prosperity of its peo-ple? Why is that in here, other than as an experiment in what some would believe is the process to prosperity which is through austerity? So the way to pros-perity in the minds of those who will be voting on this bill—as to my Demo-cratic colleagues, I hope they under-stand that I have stood with them when they have talked about raising the minimum wage.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4613 June 28, 2016 
talked about raising the minimum wage. We see raising the minimum wage as a way to create greater rising wages for our families. I think one of the great discontents we have in this country today, as is evidenced in the political process, is that despite all the major macro-economic numbers—where we see the GDP rising, where we see unemploy-ment lowering, where we see all of the realities of low interest rates, a strong stock market, and all of these macro-economic indicators that would sug-gest everything is good—for the aver-age American, their challenge is that they see their wages and income stag-nant, and yet they see their challenges rising—paying a mortgage, putting food on the table, educating their kids, having them graduate but not under a mountain of debt, being able to think about retirement in the future, and in-creasingly having to take care of a loved one, as my sister did with my dear mother who faced the challenges of Alzheimer’s before she died. That is a very American story. What is our answer to that? Our an-swer to that for the people of Puerto Rico is to cut their wages. Let’s not guarantee you a Federal minimum wage, and, by the way, if you are forced to work overtime, let’s not give you the protections that are given in the laws of the United States. So for U.S. citizens, my colleagues here advocate to raise the minimum wage, have overtime protections, and do what Secretary Perez did in pro-viding the overtime protections. But for the people of Puerto Rico, it is OK. Now I know some colleagues will say: Well, that provision suggests that the Governor would have to invoke that. He would have to invoke not having a minimum wage for certain younger workers and that, as to the overtime protections, he would have to invoke waiving the overtime protections. The problem is that this control board could very well say in its sole discre-tion: You know what; you can’t afford to pay the minimum wage to your peo-ple. You can’t afford overtime protec-tions. You should really consider re-voking that. Since that control board is the only guarantor or decider of whether you will get access to restructuring, that is an awful lot of power to weigh on the Governor of Puerto Rico. If they say to him: We believe the Republicans and the majority of the Congress have de-cided that there should be this excep-tion. Ultimately, you should really re-voke that. That is why they put it there in the first place—that control board will have an enormous amount of power. Reading from the legislation: 
A fiscal plan developed under this section shall, with respect to the territorial govern-ment or covered territorial instrumentality, provide a method to achieve fiscal responsi-bility and access to the capital markets . . . [and] adopt appropriate recommendations submitted by the oversight board under Sec-tion 205(a). . . . ’’ This board is incredibly powerful. So if this board says: You know, you have an opportunity, Governor, to undo the minimum wage and overtime protec-tions, well, that is a lot of power that that Governor is facing and a board that holds Puerto Rico’s future in its hands to determine whether or not there will be access to restructuring. So, guess what. We are voting for this. We are going to start the demise of the minimum wage and overtime. If you somehow think you can narrow it to the citizens of Puerto Rico, who are U.S. citizens, then you are saying that they are not citizens but that they are, in fact, subjects. At a time when we are working to in-crease workers’ wages, this legislation goes in the opposite direction. It actu-ally cuts workers’ wages. It amazes me that the solution to Puerto Rico’s economy growing again is to ensure that workers can make even less money. I don’t think lowering people’s wages is a pro-growth strat-egy. It is a pro-migration strategy, be-cause if I am a U.S. citizen living on the island of Puerto Rico, and I say: Wow, if I take a flight to Newark, NJ, or if I take a flight to Orlando, FL, or if I take a flight to New York City or to anywhere else in this great country and if I get a job there, I will have a full minimum wage paid and I will have overtime protections. By the way, I am going to have access, if I am a senior citizen, to have all of my Medi-care paid for, like any other U.S. cit-izen. If I have a child eligible for Med-icaid payments, I will get the full pay-ment. When I work in the United States, I will have access to the child tax credits which I don’t have in Puer-to Rico. There is a whole host of rea-sons why cutting the minimum wage and workers’ wages isn’t about improv-ing the opportunity to have a pro- growth strategy. It is going to drive a pro-migration to the United States. All it will do is intensify the out-migration to the mainland, where people are eli-gible for higher minimum wages and commonsense overtime protections. In addition, this bill does nothing—I repeat, nothing—to fix the impending health care funding cliff, a crisis that will impact generations of Puerto Ricans not just today but obviously for years to come. For decades, the health care system in Puerto Rico, most nota-bly Medicare and Medicaid, have been grossly underfunded. If we talk about poor choices that maybe various ad-ministrations in Puerto Rico have made on both sides of the equation, well, we have exacerbated their cir-cumstances by the way in which we have treated the U.S. citizens in Puer-to Rico. They receive rates that are half of those anywhere else in the country. If you are a U.S. citizen living in Puerto Rico under Medicare or Med-icaid, you get half, roughly, of those rates of anywhere else in the country. So if you come to the United States, you get the other half. You get full funding. That not only affects the indi-vidual in terms of their health care and their economic output, but it affects the system of providers, the services, hospitals, doctors, and technicians be-cause the funding is less. This inequal-ity in payments comes even as U.S. citizens on the island pay the same amount in Medicare and Social Secu-rity taxes. Let me repeat that. Citizens on the island of Puerto Rico, who are U.S. citizens, pay the same amount in Medi-care and Social Security taxes as those of us on the mainland, yet we reim-burse them at different rates. So despite paying their fair share of taxes to pay for these vital health pro-grams, the island’s health system is funded at half the rate of other U.S. providers, which is an unsustainably low rate. Is it any wonder, given this inequality, that doctors on the island aren’t able to sustain a practice and are moving to the mainland? The ‘‘mass exodus of doctors,’’ as it was called in a story on National Pub-lic Radio this year, is having a dra-matic effect on the island’s population. Unlike other critical issues facing the island, a prolonged emigration of health care providers to the mainland United States cannot be reversed quickly because once these providers have relocated, they are unlikely to re-turn. Their absence is already leading to a tremendous gap in the health care workforce, further exacerbating the difficulty Puerto Rico residents face when seeking care. This funding in-equality is largely responsible for the fact that health care accounts for roughly a third of the island’s debt. Let me repeat that. The funding in-equality for the U.S. citizens in Puerto Rico is responsible for the fact that health care accounts are roughly a third of the island’s debt. So when we talk about the people of Puerto Rico and whatever their governmental lead-ers have decided in the past, we have contributed as a Congress, treating the people of Puerto Rico with such a dis-parity that they have had to use a third of their own money, which has been generated in debt, in order to meet the health care of those U.S. citi-zens. How is that fair? So we have contributed to this crisis, and our idea of helping to solve the cri-sis is to create an unelected control board that has total say, that can cut budgets, that can have austerity, that can eliminate minimum wage and over-time protections, and that does noth-ing to equalize the fairness and reim-bursement on the health care that I just described as the cause of nearly one-third of the debt. This is not a problem of bad doctors or irresponsible patients. It is a prob-lem of unfair treatment and bottom- basement funding levels that have driv-en the island’s health care system to a breaking point. I don’t want to make light of the decisions facing providers in Puerto Rico to move off the island. On the contrary, I can only imagine how difficult it is to uproot your fam-ily to move to the mainland, leaving

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES4614 June 28, 2016 
behind your whole legacy, your whole family, friends, schools, and, in the case of providers, patients who rely on them for critical care. So this decision cannot be easy for those providers who are still in Puerto Rico today, but it has become increasingly difficult to put off longer. There is already a serious lack of providers to cover the needs of the is-land’s residents. With doctors leaving the island in droves, it is a situation that is getting worse literally day by day. The situation facing health care in Puerto Rico has truly hit a crisis point. Now, let me take a step back and look at how the island’s health care system got to this point, because it is all part of why they have a fiscal chal-lenge. Take Puerto Rico’s Medicaid Pro-gram. It is called miSALUD, or my health, and this vital program covers half of all Puerto Ricans. It is a basic lifeline to more than 1.4 million people, but it is capped and therefore limited in what it can do. Unlike the Medicaid Program in my State of New Jersey or in any of the other 49 States or the Dis-trict of Columbia, the Medicaid Pro-gram in Puerto Rico is limited in the funds available to cover the health care costs of its beneficiaries. Mississippi, which has a smaller over-all population and less than half of the Medicaid enrollees as Puerto Rico, re-ceived a whopping 74 percent of its Medicaid funds from the Federal Gov-ernment last year. In Puerto Rico, however, the percentage was only 55 percent, and it is set that low in stat-ute. During the debate on the Affordable Care Act, I was able to successfully en-sure that additional funding was in-cluded to help the territories. This funding amounted to more than $7 bil-lion in total, of which $6.3 billion went to Puerto Rico and has helped to keep the program solvent. But that is about to expire at the end of fiscal year 2019. While this may seem way out into the future, there is a good chance that the funding will run out sooner rather than later, and some estimates have the funding being used for other health ex-penses by this time next year. I want to add that those estimates were made before we knew of the gravity of the Zika virus and what it is imposing upon the people of Puerto Rico. It is a topic I want to momentarily discuss further. But Puerto Rico is, in essence, the epicenter in terms of the United States, as part of the United States and its Commonwealth status, of the challenge of the Zika virus. The solution to the impending Med-icaid funding cliff is clear: Provide the same open-ended funding stream in the same way as any other State. This would immediately provide Puerto Rico’s Medicaid program with the in-flux of funding it needs to more ade-quately cover costs, ensure that bene-ficiaries are able to get treatments, and stem the tide of doctors and other providers fleeing for the mainland. The grand irony of the whole situation is that my Republican friends since day one have refused to consider providing this type of equitable treatment to Puerto Rico. I don’t want to make as-sumptions on motives, but it appears that not only do they support the sta-tus quo on Puerto Rico, but they are also actively working to impose the same short-sighted, doomed-to-fail policies on the other Medicaid pro-grams we have on Puerto Rico as well. Just last week, Republicans released a white paper calling for the imposi-tion of so-called per capita caps on the Medicaid program. This policy, a block grant by any other name, would be dev-astating for our Nation’s Medicaid pro-gram, imposing the same funding limi-tations on Medicaid programs through-out the country as we are currently ex-periencing in Puerto Rico. We see the results of those caps. As we stand here today, watching in real time as Puerto Rico’s Medicaid program is in crisis and facing a fund-ing cliff set to cause chaos for more than a million beneficiaries, Repub-licans have said to the people of this country: We refuse to accept that re-ality and admit that capping Medicaid is a terrible idea with catastrophic Medicare and health care con-sequences. On the contrary, what we see in Puerto Rico—we want to make that the reality for the rest of the Na-tion. It is not a surprise. I know many— not all, but many—of my colleagues have refused to acknowledge the bene-fits of Medicaid, not only to the mil-lions of people who rely on it to get health care, but there are billions of dollars left on the table in Republican- led States that refuse to expand Med-icaid under the Affordable Care Act. Unfortunately, in the case of Med-icaid, reality plays a diminished role in Republican policy development. This is true when it comes to the very serious threat of Zika in Puerto Rico. Accord-ing to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there are already more than 1,800 cases of locally acquired Zika infection. That is infinitely more than the rest of the country, which has a combined total of, as I understand it, zero locally acquired infections. That means that the people in Puerto Rico face a risk everywhere they are—at home, at work, at school. Let’s not forget that 68 percent of the island’s population enrolled in either Medicare or Medicaid. Therefore, the threat it poses for a health care system on the brink of collapse cannot be over-stated. This morning the Senate voted not to invoke cloture on a bill to provide funding on Zika because it not only lacks the funding necessary for an ade-quate response for Puerto Rico—and, for that fact, the entire country—it also includes several unacceptable pol-icy riders. One example is to further re-strict access to contraception for a dis-ease that is not only sexually trans-mitted but has potentially devastating effects on fetuses. So that doesn’t make any sense. The people of Puerto Rico deserve ac-cess to health care. They deserve to know that the taxes they paid to fund critical programs such as Medicare and Medicaid will be available to them just as they are to any fellow Americans on the mainland. They deserve to know their doctors can sustain a medical practice and that they will be there to treat them when they are sick. Above all, they deserve to be treated with eq-uity and fairness like any other Amer-ican—this is a central point—not like second-class citizens simply because they call Puerto Rico home. Let me go through some of the chal-lenges of why this bill is, in my view, simply not acceptable. Here are five critical flaws of this legislation. It has an undemocratic, neo-colonial control board, a majority appointed by Republicans but none by the people of Puerto Rico—none. So this would be the equivalent of our States having a challenge, and the Governor of that State and the legislature of that State and no one who resides in that State having anybody on a control board that is going to dictate its future—no one who comes from the elected rep-resentatives of that State. So that State would be told ‘‘By the way, here is what you are going to do’’ by an unelected, undemocratic control board. Secondly, I hear a lot that sup-posedly the hedge funds are all against this legislation. Well, it has a prioritization of hedge funds over retir-ees and essential services. You have to read the language of the PROMESA legislation. It is clear that it not only reaffirms some of what it says in the Puerto Rican Constitution, but it goes beyond. It has a prioritization of those hedge funds over retirees and essential services. As I have said before, there is a lack of a clear pathway. The only reason we are even considering legislation is to grant Puerto Rico access to the bank-ruptcy courts for restructuring. It had some of that capacity in the past. Somehow it was taken away. It lacks a clear pathway to restructure. It re-quires a 5-to-2 super majority vote, which means that a minority—three members—can hold back or never grant a pathway to restructuring or make it go through such incredible hurdles, in-cluding how it deals with creditors, be-fore it ever guarantees—if it ever guar-antees in its sole discretion—whether Puerto Rico has met the standards to qualify for the pathway to restruc-turing. It would only happen if they vote to do so. The whole purpose of this legislation was to give Puerto Rico access to re-structuring. Yet we are creating a con-trol board with a super majority, which means a minority can dictate what the majority view might be, and that mi-nority can hold the 3.5 million U.S. citizens of Puerto Rico hostage to a fu-ture that they certainly don’t want.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4615 June 28, 2016 
It has continued disparity in health care funding, as I was just speaking about, and tax credits. And it goes to a $4.25 per-hour min-imum wage with no overtime protec-tions. So if you live in Puerto Rico, the way to get ahead is to have your min-imum wage cut for a certain group of citizens, as dictated by the legislation. Let me talk about this disparity in health care funding and tax cuts. The same kind of disparate treatment is also prevalent for individual tax cred-its such as the earned income tax cred-it and the child tax credit. Despite serving our country and being subject to payroll taxes, the 3.5 million American citizens of Puerto Rico are not eligible for the EITC and only partly eligible for the CTC. In par-ticular, the earned-income tax credit is a ready-made tool that has been proven to reduce unemployment and poverty and increase labor participation and economic growth. It encourages people to enter the workforce rather than being part of an informal economy that strips away the tax base. Numerous studies have shown the power of the earned-income tax credit to draw peo-ple into the workforce to increase earn-ings and reduce poverty. The labor force participation rate, which measures the share of adults who are working or seeking work, is 40 percent in Puerto Rico, far below the nationwide rate of 62 percent. If there were at any time an area in the United States that needed access to the earned-income tax credit to incentivize work—to create that possibility—it is in Puerto Rico. The Department of Labor estimates that Puerto Rico’s unemployment rate is 11.7 percent—— Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield for a question? Mr. MENENDEZ. I understand that I can yield for a question, but I do not yield the floor. Mr. INHOFE. I understand that. But will the Senator please advise us as to how much longer he will be taking on the floor? Mr. MENENDEZ. I would be happy to do so. It will be several hours. Mr. INHOFE. Would the Senator mind, since I am going to be talking about projects in New Jersey and about the WRDA projects in which the Sen-ator has a lot of interest—will he yield to me to talk about that for 10 min-utes? Mr. MENENDEZ. My understanding from the Parliamentarian is I cannot do that and preserve the right to the floor. Otherwise, I would be happy to do that. Mr. INHOFE. Let me ask the Chair. Is it possible for me to go ahead and receive from him a specific period of time at the end of which he retains the floor? The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. C
AS-
SIDY). That would require unanimous consent. Mr. INHOFE. All right. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-sent that I be recognized as in morning business. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator does not have the right for a unan-imous consent, as the Senator does not have the floor. The Senator from New Jersey has the floor. Mr. INHOFE. Yes, I understand that. Mr. MENENDEZ. Thank you, Mr. President. If there were a procedural way, I would be happy to accommodate my colleague, but since there is not and since there are no amendments being permitted on this legislation, I have no other choice but to speak up for the 3.5 million U.S. citizens who call Puerto Rico home because they will not get an opportunity for amendments to be de-bated or passed. So at a time where the labor force participation rate, which measures the share of adults who are working or seeking work, is 40 percent in Puerto Rico, it is far below the 62 percent throughout the country. So the earned- income tax credit would be a tremen-dous opportunity. This legislation does nothing as it relates to that, even in the face of Puerto Rico’s unemploy-ment rate at 11.7 percent compared with 4.7 percent for the United States as a whole. At the height of the 2008–2009 finan-cial crisis, unemployment peaked at 10 percent in October of 2009—10 percent at the height of the financial crisis— yet far below Puerto Rico’s current 11.7-percent unemployment rate. It is fair to say we would be having a much different debate today if we were talk-ing about a State that had an unem-ployment rate of 11.7 percent. In relation to Puerto Rico, some of my Republican colleagues have sug-gested that there are possible tax in-centives that would better incentivize growth, labor force participation and, perhaps, investment in the Puerto Rican economy, but they dismiss the earned-income tax credit as one of those because they say Puerto Ricans do not pay Federal income tax. To begin with, most Puerto Rican households do not earn enough to be el-igible for Federal income tax. More im-portantly, if they were pulled into the formal economy through the incentive of the earned-income tax credit, they would be paying more taxes in Puerto Rico and to Puerto Rico. Finally, these American citizens are eligible for the EITC as soon as they leave Puerto Rico and come to the mainland, which is another powerful incentive to leave the island, further eroding its already limited tax base. The latest estimates indicate that ap-proximately 70,000 Puerto Rican resi-dents are now relocating to the States each year in search of economic and employment opportunities. Expanding the EITC to the people of Puerto Rico could help stem that tide. Once again, I remind my colleagues that Puerto Ricans are Americans just like you and me and should be eligible for the same benefits that we have. In addition to the five critical flaws, let me read to you some of the lan-guage of the House Interior Committee and the powers of the board so we un-derstand why it is that I feel compelled to try to convince my colleagues—in the face of there being no amendment process allowed—to vote against clo-ture, create an opportunity, a pathway toward amendments, have up-or-down votes to them, hopefully improve the legislation, and then be able to move forward. This is what the House Natural Re-sources Committee said. These are not my words or my interpretation of it. This is what the House Natural Re-sources Committee said: ‘‘The Over-sight Board may impose mandatory cuts on Puerto Rico’s government and instrumentalities—a power far beyond that exercised by the Control Board es-tablished for the District of Columbia.’’ Think about that. The oversight board may impose mandatory cuts— not that they are going to suggest to the Governor and Legislature of Puerto Rico: Hey, here is a series of things we think are wasteful. Here is a series of things we think you could do better. Here is how you could save money: You should prioritize public safety over public health. You should prioritize public education over something else. They will make the absolute deter-mination in their sole discretion on mandatory cuts on Puerto Rico’s gov-ernment and its instrumentalities. ‘‘Instrumentalities’’ means the dif-ferent agencies, whether it be the power agency or the higher education authority or any other. That is what is meant by ‘‘instrumentalities’’ or the ‘‘municipalities.’’ It has a wide range— basically any governmental entity, as we would have any governmental enti-ty in any of our States, for example. So they would impose the ability to have any mandatory cuts. Remember, this is an unelected board—no representation directed by the people of Puerto Rico from the people of Puerto Rico, but they are going to suffer mandatory cuts on their government and instru-mentalities, and our Republican col-leagues in the House wanted to pound on their chests and say ‘‘a power far be-yond that exercised by the Control Board established for the District of Columbia.’’ The District of Columbia’s Control Board is pretty significant. This one, as it relates to the 3.5 million people in Puerto Rico, this power is far beyond that which the District of Columbia has. Also from the House Natural Re-sources Committee: ‘‘The board would have broad sovereign’’—sovereign. Words mean something in legislation when we move it into law. ‘‘The board would have broad sovereign powers to effectively overrule decisions by Puer-to Rico’s legislature, governor and other public authorities.’’ So if the duly-elected Governor of Puerto Rico felt it was important in the midst of the Zika virus to go ahead and raise the budget of Puerto Rico’s health care system to deal with that

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES4616 June 28, 2016 
and for some reason the control board felt they shouldn’t spend that much on that, it could overrule that decision. If the Legislature of Puerto Rico de-cided to extend the school year for their children in public schools or if they wanted to have a special health care program for them or if they want-ed to be able to have students go to colleges and universities—and we have had a great debate in this country about the cost of a university edu-cation—and they wanted to subsidize a greater part of that, the unelected seven members of the control board— which has no one coming from Puerto Rico itself, directed by the people of Puerto Rico—can make a sovereign de-cision. ‘‘Sovereign’’ basically means they have the power to effectively overrule decisions by the Governor of Puerto Rico, who gets elected by the 3.5 million citizens in Puerto Rico; by the Legislature of Puerto Rico, which gets elected by the citizens of Puerto Rico; or by other public entities that may make decisions in that regard. They can overrule those public entities in Puerto Rico. So it is as if we had a control board in a State that could overrule the Governor, overrule the legislature, overrule the higher edu-cation authority, overrule any entity in that State, but that has no represen-tation from the people of that State. That is in essence what we are saying they can do—sovereign powers to do that. The oversight board can ‘‘effectively nullify,’’ which means that is it. You have a law and you think it is a good law for the people of Puerto Rico. Well, we don’t think it is a good law, and we are going to nullify it—‘‘any new laws or policies adopted by Puerto Rico that do not conform to requirements speci-fied in the bill.’’ But again, if those re-quirements were clearly stated, unam-biguous, defined, and we could agree on that, then maybe that might not be such an onerous power. But when near-ly 30 times you say ‘‘in the board’s sole discretion,’’ which means ‘‘I get to de-cide what I think is conforming to re-quirements specified in the bill,’’ that is an incredibly broad grant of power. Yet, for the citizens of Puerto Rico, we think that is OK. We don’t want that here, but it is OK for the people of Puerto Rico. I don’t use the word ‘‘neocolonialism’’ lightly. I don’t use that lightly. But there is a little bit of a history here that is going on, and maybe there is no better single exam-ple of our unfair and unjust treatment of Puerto Rico than the story of the is-land of Vieques, or La Isla Nina, as they call it. This is part of Puerto Rico. It is a small island, Vieques, just 21 miles long and 4 miles wide, located 8 miles off the coast of San Juan. De-spite its small size, the island is home to about 10,000 Americans. It is a beau-tiful place, with pristine beaches and one of the few bioluminescent bays left in the world. Behind me, in this picture, you can see a jelly fish and a snorkeler that are illuminated by the bioluminescent or-ganisms that naturally exist there. Mr. President, if you have an oppor-tunity to visit Vieques and its bio bay, I would encourage you to go. It is truly an extraordinary sight, with small plankton in the water that light up in an otherworldly blue when they move. On a moonless night, the waves appear to glow in the dark, and kayak tours leave trails of light behind them as they paddle through the water and ex-plore the natural beauty of Mosquito Bay. In fact, since 1980 the bay has been listed with the National Park Service as a national natural land-mark. Surrounded by mangrove trees, with a high salt content, the bay is a perfect habitat for the bioluminescent plankton, making it unique, and it is widely considered to be the best exam-ple of a bio bay in the United States and perhaps the world. But the history of this tropical para-dise is scarred with a violent and explo-sive past. In the 1940s, the U.S. Navy, in search of a location for a new base and testing ground, purchased parcels of land on Vieques that amounted to two-thirds of the entire island. On the eastern half of the island lay the Vieques Naval Training Range, on the western end was the Naval Ammuni-tion Support Detachment, and sand-wiched in between were the residents of Vieques, the 10,000 U.S. citizens. I am proud to say that my home State of New Jersey is home to mili-tary installations that are not only critical to our national defense but are a boon to our local economies and an asset to our communities and our State as a whole. And Puerto Rico has a long and storied history of support for and enlistment in our Armed Forces. However, the naval installation on Vieques was no ordinary base. In-stead, the Navy used the island—which, remember, is very small and home to a vibrant local community—as a bomb-ing range. From ship-to-shore shelling to air-to-ground bombing, Vieques was bombarded with live ammunition that left deep and lasting scars on the land-scape. I frequently hear concerns from my constituents who live near our Air Force base in New Jersey that the planes passing overhead are loud, that they are disturbing them as they go about their daily lives. It is a serious concern. We have worked with the FAA to monitor and regulate that. But imagine that instead of carrying pas-sengers or cargo to New Jersey, those planes were dropping military-grade explosives that land just a few miles from your home. Imagine warships parked off of your shore firing live rounds onto your beaches. Needless to say, this bombardment was of great concern to the people of Vieques, but for decades it continued unabated. It wasn’t until tragedy struck that people actually began to take notice of the plight of the island and to demand change. In February of 1999, 2 AV–8 Harrier aircraft fired 263 depleted uranium rounds onto the is-land, in violation of the memorandum of understanding under which the base operated. Not only are the depleted uranium rounds slightly radioactive, but they contain toxic heavy metals. Then, on April 9, 1999, an errant bomb missed its mark and killed David Sanes Rodriguez, a civilian security guard working at the base, and injured oth-ers. The Navy attributed this tragic ac-cident to human error and miscommunication between ground crews and the pilot. The death of Mr. Sanes sparked massive protests in Puerto Rico and renewed calls for the Navy to cease operation in Vieques. In July of 1999, when I was a Member of the House of Representatives, I had an opportunity to visit Vieques and see firsthand the impact of the naval oper-ations there. In the midst of all the de-scriptions of what was going on there, there was still great patriotism—great patriotism by the U.S. citizens of Puer-to Rico and the 10,000 citizens on the island of Vieques, even in the midst of what was taking place. The Navy eventually decided to go. We are a decade removed from the ces-sation of military exercises on Vieques, and much of the Federal land that once housed military equipment has been turned over to a national wildlife ref-uge, but our legacy of failure con-tinues. Although the Navy has left, providing some reprieve for the citi-zens of Vieques, they left behind a leg-acy of toxic contamination. You can see here in this picture a scuba diver off the coast of Vieques standing next to a massive unexploded ordnance left over from the Navy’s use of the island. This is not uncommon in Vieques. Vieques has one of the highest cancer rates in the entire United States and the highest in Puerto Rico. Viequesans, on average, have two heavy metal-re-lated diseases. Remember those de-pleted uranium rounds that were im-properly fired? Diseases like hyper-tension and cirrhosis occur at an astro-nomically high rate compared to the rest of Puerto Rico and the rest of the United States. The part of the island used by the Navy is listed on the national prior-ities list as a Superfund site, which could and should eventually lead to re-mediation, but that progress has been slow. The EPA has identified the possi-bility that unexploded ordnances could contain toxins like mercury, lead, cop-per, magnesium, lithium, percolate, TNT, napalm, and depleted uranium, among others. A significant part of the Superfund cleanup process is identi-fying the responsible parties and work-ing with them to come up with remedi-ation plans; however, we know who the culprit is largely here. It is us. It is the U.S. Government, and we have a re-sponsibility to the Americans living on Vieques to clean up the mess we cre-ated. Even while they were supporting the Nation and accepting what was

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4617 June 28, 2016 
going on and showing their patriotism, we left them with a Superfund site. This bill won’t do anything to take care of that responsibility and that cost, so it continues to tell the people of Puerto Rico: You are good enough to wear the uniform of the United States, you are good enough to serve the coun-try, you are good enough to bleed for it, good enough to die for it, but you are not good enough to determine your own future. I think amending the bill in front of us to provide real relief would give us the opportunity to do right by the peo-ple of Puerto Rico, possibly even to do right by the people of Vieques, to do right by the American citizens who have given so much of their lives to their country and to our military and who have been taken advantage of for our benefit. So, again, when we look at this bill and we see a control board totally un-representative of the Puerto Rican peo-ple, except for one person who must have either their primary residence or their primary business there—you can even have your primary business there without being a resident of the island and be part of determining the future of the island’s 3.5 million people—then you get a sense of why they feel they are being taken advantage of. (Ms. AYOTTE assumed the Chair.) I hope we do not continue the legacy of misuse and exploitation. We cannot let this opportunity pass by. We owe it to the people of Puerto Rico to have open and robust debate on this bill and to ensure that it provides real relief. That means having amendments. We can do it in time. I know some of my colleagues have suggested that there is a risk if we don’t have the July 1 dead-line, but this bill calls for retroactivity as it stands right now. It takes actions and says retroactively—I believe to De-cember of last year—that any actions would be, in essence, frozen. So if the bill is retroactive to December, then it would be retroactive from whenever it gets passed and signed into law, which means we could freeze any potential action and get it right on behalf of the people of Puerto Rico. Again, I want to focus on what I be-lieve are the most significant failings of this bill, most notably the vast power and undemocratic nature of the board. Not only does this legislation remain silent on so many important issues, it actually exacerbates the colo-nial status and second-class citizenship view that some Members of Congress seem to have of the 3.5 million Ameri-cans who call Puerto Rico home. I don’t. That is why I am on the floor trying to fight for their rights. Unfor-tunately, under their common-law sta-tus, they don’t have a voting represent-ative in the House of Representatives, they don’t have a voting representative in the U.S. Senate. I have one-half million U.S. citizens of Puerto Rican descent in my great State of New Jersey, many who have deep ties to family and friends on the island, and they tell me of the chal-lenges. In fact, they also tell me how they cannot believe this is the status of where they are. We have a letter that speaks for one of those national organizations, which I will get to shortly to speak to how those people who largely represent the Puerto Rican people feel in this regard. That is why many of them feel this legislation per-petuates what happened in places like Vieques, what happened in the dis-proportionate payment in Medicare and Medicaid, in health care. Yet one flight away, they have all the rights of any one of us in this Chamber or any one of us in this country. Under the legislation, the control board would have colonial-level pow-ers, which are certainly completely un-acceptable to me and certainly to the people of Puerto Rico. In fact, accord-ing to a recent poll commissioned by Puerto Rico’s largest newspaper, El Nuevo Dia, 69 percent of all respond-ents opposed the PROMESA bill, while 54 percent opposed the very idea of an oversight board. Think about that. This is Puerto Rico’s largest news-paper. Sixty-nine percent of all re-spondents oppose the PROMESA bill— 69 percent of the people of Puerto Rico. Ultimately, how are you going to have an attempt by an undemocratic control board to make dictates over 3.5 million U.S. citizens, when 69 percent said: We oppose the legislation, legislation which is supposed to be there to help them, and 69 percent said: No, what you are offering us is not something we want. Fifty-four percent oppose the very idea of an oversight board, and that consensus is talked about by a co-alition of many civil society groups in Puerto Rico, the Puerto Rican Con-sensus Against the Fiscal Board. They say: 
We write to you on behalf of the Concertacion Puertorriquena Contra la Junta de Control Fiscal (Puerto Rican Con-sensus Against the Fiscal Board); we are a broad-based organization that represents nu-merous civic and political organizations in Puerto Rico and the continental United States. Our signing members comprise labor syn-dicates and cooperatives; local business lead-ers, social, environmental and human rights organizations, artists, students and aca-demics, religious organizations, LGBTQ and feminist movements, special community or-ganizations, cooperative institutions, polit-ical parties and immigrants organizations, Puerto Rican diaspora groups as well as many individual citizens. This multi sectorial coalition has been formed as a common front to oppose H.R. 5278. Because of the negative consequences that it will have upon all of Puerto Rican so-ciety, we respectfully urge you to vote against this bill when it is presented in the Senate. After studying the H.R. 5278 bill we have reached a unanimous agreement that this bill is totally unacceptable. While it is cer-tain that Puerto Rico faces serious economic and social challenges, there is simply no way that we can consider a solution that would require our country to surrender its right to a democratic government while putting such broad dictatorial powers in the hands of a few unelected individuals. In addition to a categorical refusal to give up our human right to representative democ-racy and government, we consider the eco-nomic policies in this bill to be grossly inad-equate and detrimental to the goal of restor-ing economic growth and stability. The bill has no clear mechanism for restructuring the debt and there are no defined measures for economic development. Instead it is clear that this bill is designed to impose even more. . . . These are the people of Puerto Rico, who are very bright people, believe me. They have read the bill. They have come together in a coalition, as I de-scribed at the beginning and the intro-duction of their letter. Here is what they say: 
Instead it is clear that this bill is designed to impose even more austerity measures which would further depress the economy, exacerbate the ongoing exodus of young peo-ple and professionals and have the effect of shrinking the tax base. What lies ahead for Puerto Rico should H.R. 5278 be passed in the Senate is untold hardship for the most vulnerable sectors: the elderly, children and the working poor. With a poverty rate of 46 percent and a shrinking economy, the idea of imposing austerity measures that would reduce government services such as in health and education is unthinkable. Puerto Rico, as of this moment has no clear mechanism for restructuring its debt but an unspecific restructuring mechanism in exchange for giving up our pensions— 
An unspecific restructuring mecha-nism. It goes to what I said, which is the only reason we should be consid-ering the bill in the first place— 
our employment, our health care program and our representative democracy is not a path to recovery and cannot be considered an option. The imposition of H.R. 5278 or similar leg-islation on the part of the U.S. Congress, where we have no voting representation— 
Which is why I am standing on the floor today to speak on their behalf— 
constitutes a violation of our human rights. Furthermore, it places in evidence that the relationship between Puerto Rico and the United States has never been anything other than that of a colonial subjugation; which is considered a crime under international law regarding the rights of non-self-governing territories. The most recent SCOTUS decisions permit the U.S. Congress to approve H.R. 5278, using in effect its powers to unilaterally take over our governance in order to protect the inter-est of hedge funds and bondholders. While this action by Congress will be seen inter-nationally as one that unmasks the intrinsic 118-year-old colonial relationship, such a measure would also evidence the underlying racism that infuses relations between Puerto Rico and the United States. We will do everything within our power to stop this bill from being enacted. If the bill were however, to be approved, we are ready to resist its implementation by all available means. Furthermore, we have also declared our collective willingness and disposition to go forward with a plan of broad protests as well as acts of civil disobedience in Puerto Rico and in the United States. As a broad co-alition defending the people of Puerto Rico against a great injustice— 
These are all their words, not mine— 
we have the duty and right to vigorously pursue a policy of consistent noncooperation until the legislation is withdrawn.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES4618 June 28, 2016 
We urge you to forge a different path, one that respects our right to democracy and dignity and that is intent on truly fixing the underlying problems; we ask you to vote NO on H.R. 5278. 
In that same vein, let me read what Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon, one of the most respected public figures in Puerto Rico who governed the island for 12 years, wrote: 
I was governor of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico for 12 years. In 1993, I handed over my office to my successor with a mod-est budget surplus, a growing economy, and access to the financial markets at reason-able rates. I write to request an open debate on the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Stability Act [PROMESA] which would pro-vide Puerto Rico much needed relief for the adjustment of debts but will needlessly in-flict irreparable and permanent damage to the political relationship of Puerto Rico with the United States of America. As recently as June 9, 2016, the Supreme Court of the United States has described this relationship as follows: ‘‘Puerto Rico, like a state, is an autonomous political entity, sov-ereign over matters not ruled by the [Fed-eral] Constitution.’’ This sovereignty over our internal affairs is exercised by the people of Puerto Rico through our own Constitution under a com-pact entered in 1952 with the Congress of the United States. This compact was ordained in order to es-tablish the relationship between Puerto Rico and the United States under the principle— 
And I am creating emphasis here— 
under the principle of the consent of the gov-erned. 
Which is the hallmark of our great democracy, the principle of the consent of the governed. 
The Oversight, Management, and Stability Act needlessly, empowers the Oversight Board that it creates with the authority to override the decisions of the Governor of Puerto Rico, and the laws of the Legislature, thus encroaching on the sovereign powers of the Commonwealth rendering nugatory the right to vote of the citizens of the Common-wealth. This empowerment of the Oversight Board by the Congress tramples upon the compact providing for self-government and under-mines the democratic underpinnings of the Commonwealth relationship established with the United States. It will be an irreparable blow even after the Board is terminated. The encroachment powers of the Board are not necessary to ensure compliance by Puer-to Rico with the Fiscal Plan required by the Act. There are other means consistent with respect for Puerto Rico’s sovereignty and self-government to accomplish this. I respectfully request that the members of the Senate have the opportunity to engage in an open debate and be allowed to present amendments so that the bill may respect the democratic process in Puerto Rico and the sovereignty of its citizens. 
Let me quote from a letter that an-other former Governor, Anibal Acevedo Vila—who at one time also served in the House of Representatives as Resi-dent Commissioner of Puerto Rico— said: 
As former governor of Puerto Rico and former member of Congress, I am writing you to express my strong opposition to S 2328 (HR 5278) under consideration of the Senate. All candidates for Governor of Puerto Rico in the November election, the majority of the members of the Puerto Rican House of Representatives and the Senate, and the ma-jority of Puerto Ricans . . . oppose this bill as well. A bill that promises only one thing for cer-tain: to end our Republican form of govern-ment with its checks and balances. The bill called PROMESA is known in Puerto Rico as La Junta, a name commonly used for mili-tary dictatorships in Latin America. Please, do not take all its implications lightly. It is incredible and a shame that the most important piece of legislation considered by Congress regarding Puerto Rico since the au-thorization and approval of the Common-wealth Constitution in 1952, effectively de-nies basic principles of democracy and self- government, trashes that same Constitution and uses the plenary powers of Congress with a mentality reminiscent of 18th century co-lonialism. That is why I urge you to vote NO on Clo-ture and to support the amendments that have been filed to create a more representa-tive board, limit the overreaching powers of the board, establish a clear and effective path to restructuring, and really protect pensions and basic services to the people. These amendments will eliminate many of the most aggravating dispositions of this bill. And if the amendments are not approved I strongly urge you to vote NO on approval. Those who are pushing to blindly pass the bill acknowledge its imperfections and its excesses. They say Congress will need to do more work in the future to help Puerto Rico. But you know, as do they and do I that the Congressional calendar won’t allow further action on Puerto Rico for a long time. We will be stuck with the consequences. It’s im-perative to get it right this time. The July 1st deadline is not the end of the world. The bill already has retroactive provi-sions. Don’t make July 1st the end of democ-racy for Puerto Ricans. ‘‘‘Don’t make July 1st the end of de-mocracy for Puerto Ricans.’’ I am going to read some other state-ments to show you the breadth and scope of the opposition, including from those who are now running for Gov-ernor. Those are two very esteemed former Governors of Puerto Rico. You heard the consensus, the group that came together from all different walks of life. But to suggest there is political support from the people of Puerto Rico beyond those individuals I have already read—let me read to you from those who are running for Governor in Puer-to Rico, what they say. Mr. David Bernier, who leads the pop-ular Democratic Party and who is their current candidate for Governor, wrote: 
Dear Majority Leader McConnell: I am Dr. David Bernier, former Secretary of State of Puerto Rico, as well as current candidate for Governor of the Popular Demo-cratic Party (PPD, for its Spanish acronym), which I preside. As you know, the PPD is the governing party controlling the Executive and Legislative branch in Puerto Rico. I have written to you on several occasions expressing my opposition to, and deep con-cerns with, H.R. 5278, the so-called PROMESA bill. These concerns are shared by a clear majority of Puerto Ricans who are opposed to this bill, as well as is every can-didate for Governor of every political party, due to its undemocratic financial control board, the lack of real tools for economic growth, and the uncertain treatment given to pensioners, among other reasons. Fortunately it is still not too late. That is why I urge you to approve five amendments being proposed by Senator ROBERT MENEN -
DEZwhich would remedy many of the fatal flaws contained in this bill. One of these amendments would ensure that our retirees are given a real priority during this process. Other amendments are aimed at guaran-teeing a minimum level of participation by Puerto Ricans on the control board and mak-ing sure central services are rendered. Most importantly, one of these amend-ments would prevent the federal overreach and wholesale takeover of Puerto Rico’s gov-ernment by striking Section 205 of PROMESA. This would ensure that voters’ elected representatives have the last say over the Commonwealth’s government, in-stead of a group of 7 unelected Washington bureaucrats. Surely the Governors and state legislators of Kentucky and Nevada would not accept the type of blatant violation of their fundamental right to self-government that would be imposed on Puerto Rico under this bill. For these reasons we urge you to adopt the amendments proposed by Senator M
ENENDEZ , as they would avert the violation of Puerto Ricans’ democratic rights and ensure the protection of our retirees’ hard-earned public pensions. We will therefore continue to op-pose the PROMESA bill unless and until these amendments are included in the final legislation. 
There is Rafael Bernabe, who is run-ning for Governor of Puerto Rico for the Partido del Pueblo Trabajador. He says: 
As candidate for Governor of Puerto Rico for the Partido del Pueblo Trabajador I wish to convey to you our firm opposition to the PROMESA Bill that is now under consider-ation in the Senate. We believe that the fiscal and economic policies that affect the Puerto Rican people need to be adopted by the representatives elected by the Puerto Rican people. The PROMESA bill violates this fundamental democratic principle as it would create an unelected board that would have consider-able powers to impose or block fiscal meas-ures and policies in Puerto Rico. Such an or-ganism would lack all democratic legitimacy and would only make the resolution of Puer-to Rico’s debt crisis more difficult. Not surprisingly, a vast array of organiza-tions in Puerto Rico and the Puerto Rican diaspora have expressed their rejection of this legislation. In order to regain the path of economic de-velopment, Puerto Rico requires: 1. An enabling renegotiation of its public debts. We label it enabling since it should en-able Puerto Rico to attain a path of sustain-able economic development. This renegoti-ation must have as a priority the protection of pensions and essential public services. 2. An audit of Puerto Rico’s debts. There are excellent grounds to suspect that a sig-nificant portion of this debt is illegal, uncon-stitutional or otherwise illegitimate. This, in turn, is legal ground for annulling such portions. 3. A suspension of payments on this unsustainable debt until an audit and an adequate renegotiation is completed. 
It goes on to say a series of others. 
Unfortunately, the PROMESA bill includes no provisions that correspond with these re-quirements. 
They suggest that PROMESA be put aside and that a brief substitute meas-ure regarding point 4, which, in es-sence, is a temporary suspension, be in place. Mr. Hector Ferrer is the current can-didate for Resident Commissioner.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4619 June 28, 2016 
Resident Commissioner, for those who may not follow this, is the nonvoting delegate from Puerto Rico to the House of Representatives. They get to be a voice for Puerto Rico. They act very strongly on behalf of the 3.5 million American citizens of Puerto Rico, but they don’t have a vote in the House of Representatives, and there is no such delegate here. This gentleman, Hector Ferrer, the current candidate for Resident Com-missioner, the person who would be that voice in the House of Representa-tives for the popular Democratic Party of Puerto Rico, writes: 
I [am] writing to respectfully request you vote NO on cloture and to support an open amendment process on the Puerto Rico Over-sight, Management, and Economic Stability Act. The simple reality is that, as drafted, PROMESA is an affront to the basic right of the Puerto Rican people to self-governance. This is not in dispute—the bill plainly sup-plants our elected government with a feder-ally-appointed ‘‘Oversight Board,’’ which the people of the Commonwealth will have essen-tial no say in. This should be alarming not only to the Puerto Rican people, but to any-one who believes in the democratic ideals of American government. This is a bill that can and should be im-proved through debate and the full amend-ment process. To circumvent that process simply for the purpose of meeting super-fluous deadline is to do a great disservice to the Puerto Rican people. There is simply no evidence to suggest that a missed debt pay-ment by our government on July 1 will have the consequences the proponents claim. Rather, we should be fighting for the right bill that can bring real relief and economic opportunity to the Puerto Rican people. Puerto Ricans have much at stake in this debate, and I commend your willingness to lead and advocate for a position held by the overwhelming majority of us. 
Other national organizations have written. The National Conference of Puerto Rican Women, Inc., writes: 
Dear Majority Leader McConnell and Democratic Leader Reid: We, the National Conference of Puerto Rican Women, representing Puerto Rican women and other Latinas across the United States, urge the Senate to amend bill H.R. 5278, also known as PROMESA. We believe that, as it stands today, PROMESA, cannot live up to the ‘‘promise’’ of helping Puerto Rico resolve its fiscal crisis without exacer-bating the humanitarian fiscal crisis that continues to unfold in the island. We strongly oppose the following three as-pects of H.R. 5278 that was passed by the U.S. House of Representatives: (1) The ‘‘Oversight’’ Board is not required to create a comprehensive economic develop-ment strategy and yet imposes— 
This is what Senator S ANDERS was bringing up in his colloquy with me earlier— 
an additional debt burden of $370 million on the people of Puerto Rico to cover their ex-penses, with hundreds of millions more in implementation costs, according to the Con-gressional Budget Office scoring of the bill. 
I would add, with a dedicated revenue source. How many times wouldn’t we like to see a dedicated revenue source in the things we advocate? That is a difficult thing to accomplish, but this control board gets a dedicated revenue source, all paid for by the people of Puerto Rico, even in the midst of an enormous economic challenge. H.R. 5278 authorizes the Governor of Puer-to Rico, with the consent of the ‘‘Oversight’’ Board, to lower the federal minimum wage to $4.25 for those 25 years old and younger, accelerating the exodus of young talent and thereby hindering Puerto Rico’s future eco-nomic growth. The creation of the ‘‘Oversight’’ Board out-lined in PROMESA focuses on the method by which members are selected without suffi-cient consideration to the expertise needed to ensure a viable outcome. The lives of Puerto Ricans, who are Amer-ican citizens, have been placed in an unprec-edented vulnerable position so desperate that many Puerto Ricans have been forced to abandon their homes and leave loved ones to migrate to the United States mainland in search of employment. Despite efforts to maintain some semblance of normalcy, their lives have been harshly disrupted. They are struggling with low wage jobs or unemploy-ment, while health services are drastically reduced and schools are being closed. We therefore urge the Senate to amend H.R. 5278 as follows: Eliminate the provisions authorizing the board to prevent the enforcement of any law, regulation or action duly taken by the elect-ed officials of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. Eliminate provisions that authorize the Board to supplement the will of the elected officials of Puerto Rico with a budget and a fiscal plan that overrides the express wishes of the Legislature and the Governor of Puer-to Rico. Require the Oversight Board to develop a sound economic development strategy for Puerto Rico inclusive of a cost benefit anal-ysis; a plan that takes into account lowering the unemployment rate, improving public services, fostering entrepreneurship, pro-tecting the natural resources and agricul-tural development as a means to achieve and sustain economic growth and stability. Require the Oversight committee to main-tain the same minimum wage and healthcare benefits equal to the U.S. including the bene-fits to Veterans’ Federal assistance program. Require all members of the board to be nominated by the free selection of the Presi-dent. Require only a simple majority to vote in favor of restructuring Puerto Rico’s debt. 
Everybody on the island recognizes this as a critical element. A minority of the board can stop the majority will because the legislation calls for a supermajority of five of seven to cast a vote for restructuring. People on the island understand that, at a minimum, a simple majority should be required for restructuring Puerto Rico’s debt. 
Include economic incentives to ensure that Puerto Rice not only balances its budgets, but that it can also grows its economy and eventually pay its debts. Ensure that the language that says that Puerto Rico’s pension systems are ‘‘ade-quately funded’’ be changed to ‘‘fully fund-ed’’ in order to prevent over 300,000 retirees and public employees from suffering further cuts to their benefits. It is with great hope we write this request for support of Puerto Rico during this time of hardship. As U.S. citizens, Puerto Ricans have made enormous contributions to this society: men and women [from Puerto Rico] have fought in every war, where many gave their lives, contributed to science, education and the arts and the economy. We now look to our elected officials to demonstrate their commitment to service and equity for citi-zens and work to amend H.R. 5278 so that any fiscal remedy is not at the expense of the Puerto Rican people and does not exacer-bate the existing humanitarian crisis. We further believe that if these amend-ments are not included, the bill should not be approved as is and we would oppose this legislation as it would represent a frontal at-tack on the island’s democratic rights, and would not include any economic develop-ment measures that are the only lasting so-lutions to this crisis. So there is a common thread to all of these different individuals who have led the 3.5 million citizens of Puerto Rico. All those who aspire to lead the 3.5 million citizens of Puerto Rico, all of the civic society groups, they under-stand the neocolonialism of the legisla-tion. They understand there is no clear pathway to restructuring, and they un-derstand, to quote this part of that let-ter, that it is ‘‘a frontal attack on the island’s democratic rights.’’ As the senior member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I have heard many of my colleagues on the floor, in committee, and elsewhere, talk eloquently about democratic and human rights globally, worldwide. We are a beacon of light to the rest of the world for democracy and human rights. Yet, for the 3.5 million citizens of the United States who call Puerto Rico home, if we do this, this is not a beacon of light, it is not a respect for democ-racy. Yet that is what we are poised to do, without amendment. The Coalition of Women’s Organiza-tions in Puerto Rico wrote: 
The Puerto Rico Women’s Movement joins many organizations and other sectors that are opposed to a Federal Fiscal Control Board appointed by the US government for Puerto Rico. ‘‘Puerto Rico is going through great economic and financial challenges. ‘‘The Puerto Rico Women’s Movement has consistently denounced how austerity meas-ures adopted within the island are severely weakening the human rights of our popu-lation. ‘‘The Federal Fiscal Control Board pro-posed by the US Congress would be staffed by individuals who do not represent Puerto Rico’s interests. ‘‘This Federal Fiscal Control Board will have only one task: ensuring the payment of a multibillion dollar debt at the expense of our people’s quality of life,’’ stated Josie Pantoja, spokesperson for the feminist orga-nization. The Puerto Rico Women’s Move-ment is a collective of women’s organiza-tions, feminist groups and activists. 
The Puerto Rico Women’s Movement has sent a letter to many of our col-leagues requesting that they vote against the current version of H.R. 2578, which empowers the fiscal control board to supersede and veto the deci-sions of publicly elected officials in Puerto Rico. And they go on: 
‘‘MAMPR, Proyecto Matria, InterMujeres, the Caribbean Institute of Human Rights, feminists and activists denounced that the imposition of such Board represents a seri-ous human rights violation against the peo-ple of Puerto Rico,’’ expressed Eva Prados, also spokesperson of the collective. Should H.R. 5278 pass in the Senate, it would bring untold hardship to the most vul-nerable sectors: the elderly, children, poor

women and the working class. With a pov-erty rate of 46 percent (where women rep-resent 57 percent of those living in poverty) and a shrinking economy, the idea of impos-ing austerity measures that would continue to reduce government services in health, education, access to justice, among others, is unthinkable.’’ 
So here we are. The Puerto Rico Women’s Movement is going to join different strategies of resistance at the People’s Assembly to be held on Satur-day, June 25—that took place—and to speak out against these injustices. I ask unanimous consent that all of these letters that I have read be print-ed in the R
ECORD . There being no objection, the mate-rial was ordered to be printed in the R
ECORD , as follows: 
JUNE14, 2016. From: Spokespersons, Concertacio ´n Puertorriquen˜a Contra la Junta de Con-trol Fiscal, San Juan, Puerto Rico. To: Hon. Senator Bob Mene´ndez, U.S. Sen-ate, Washington, DC. D
EARSENATOR MENE´NDEZ , We write to you on behalf of the Concertacio ´n Puertorriquen˜a Contra la Junta de Control Fiscal (Puerto Rican Consensus Against the Fiscal Board); we are a broad-based organiza-tion that represents numerous civic and po-litical organizations in Puerto Rico and the continental United States. Our signing mem-bers comprise labor syndicates and coopera-tives; local business leaders, social, environ-mental and human rights organizations, art-ists, students and academics, religious orga-nizations, LGBTTQ and feminist movements, special communities organizations, coopera-tive institutions, political parties and immi-grants organizations, Puerto Rican diaspora groups as well as many individual citizens. This multi sectorial coalition has been formed as a common front to oppose H.R. 5278. Because of the negative consequences that it will have upon all of Puerto Rican so-ciety, we respectfully urge you to vote against this bill when it is presented in the Senate. After studying the H.R. 5278 bill we have reached a unanimous agreement that this bill is totally unacceptable. While it is cer-tain that Puerto Rico faces serious economic and social challenges, there is simply no way that we can consider a solution that would require our country to surrender its right to a democratic government while putting such broad dictatorial powers in the hands of a few unelected individuals. In addition to a categorical refusal to give up our human right to representative democ-racy and government, we consider the eco-nomic policies in this bill to be grossly inad-equate and detrimental to the goal of restor-ing economic growth and stability. The bill has no clear mechanism for restructuring the debt and there are no defined measures for economic development. Instead it is clear that this bill is designed to impose even more austerity measures which would fur-ther depress the economy, exacerbate the on-going exodus of young people and profes-sionals and have the effect of shrinking the tax base. What lies ahead for Puerto Rico should H.R. 5278 be passed in the Senate is untold hardship for the most vulnerable sec-tors: the elderly, children and the working poor. With a poverty rate of 46% and a shrinking economy, the idea of imposing austerity measures that would reduce gov-ernment services such as in health and edu-cation is unthinkable. Puerto Rico, as of this moment has no clear mechanism for restructuring its debt but an unspecific restructuring mechanism in exchange for giving up our pensions, our employment, our health care program and our representative democracy is not a path to recovery and cannot be considered an op-tion. The imposition of H.R. 5278 or similar leg-islation on the part of U.S. Congress, where we have no voting representation, con-stitutes a violation of our human rights. Furthermore, it places in evidence that the relationship between Puerto Rico and the United States has never been anything other than that of colonial subjugation; which is considered a crime under international law regarding the rights of non-self-governing territories. The most recent SCOTUS decisions permit the U.S. Congress to approve H.R. 5278, using in effect its powers to unilaterally take over our governance in order to protect the inter-est of hedge funds and bondholders. While this action by Congress will be seen inter-nationally as one that unmasks the intrinsic 118–year-old colonial relationship, such a measure would also evidence the underlying racism that infuses relations between Puerto Rico and the United States. We will do everything within our power to stop this bill from being enacted. If the bill were however, to be approved, we are ready to resist its implementation by all available means. Furthermore, we have also declared our collective willingness and disposition to go forward with a plan of broad protests as well as acts of civil disobedience in Puerto Rico and in the United States. As a broad co-alition defending the people of Puerto Rico against a great injustice, have the duty and right to vigorously pursue a policy of con-sistent noncooperation until this legislation is withdrawn. We urge you to forge a different path, one that respects our right to democracy and dignity and that is intent on truly fixing the underlying problems; we ask you to vote NO on H.R. 5278. Sincerely, The spokespersons for the Concertacio ´n Puertorriquen˜a Contra la Junta de Control Fiscal: J

EMOCRATIC LEADER REID: We, the National Conference of Puerto Rican Women (NACOPRW), representing Puerto Rican women and other Latinas across the United States urges the Senate to amend bill H.R. 5278, also known as PROMESA. We believe that, as it stands today, PROMESA, cannot live up to the ‘‘promise’’ of helping Puerto Rico resolve its fiscal crisis without exacer-bating the humanitarian and fiscal crisis that continues to unfold in the island.

EAR SENATORS : I am writing to respect-fully request you vote NO on closure and to support an open amendment process on the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act. (S 2378) The simple reality is that, as drafted, PROMESA is an affront to the basic right of the Puerto Rican people to self-governance. This is not in dispute—the bill plainly sup-plants our elected government with a feder-ally-appointed ‘‘Oversight Board,’’ which the people of the Commonwealth will have essen-tially no say in. This should be alarming not only to the Puerto Rican people, but to any-one who believes in the democratic ideals of American government. This is a bill that can and should be im-proved through debate and the full amend-ment process. To circumvent that process simply for the purpose of meeting super-fluous deadline is to do a great disservice to the Puerto Rican people. There is simply no evidence to suggest that a missed debt pay-ment by our government on July 1 will have the consequences the proponents claim. Rather, we should be fighting for the right bill that can bring real relief and economic opportunity to the Puerto Rican people. Puerto Ricans have much at stake in this debate, and I commend your willingness to lead and advocate for a position held by the overwhelming majority of us. I look forward to doing anything that I can to further your efforts. Sincerely, H

O THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES OF  A
MERICA : I was governor of the Common-wealth of Puerto Rico for 12 years. In 1993, I handed over my office to my successor with a modest budget surplus, a growing econ-omy, and access to the financial markets at reasonable rates. I write to request an open debate on the Puerto Rico Oversight, Man-agement and Stability Act which would pro-vide Puerto Rico much needed relief for the adjustment of debts but will needlessly in-flict irreparable and permanent damage to the political relationship of Puerto Rico with the United States of America. As recently as June 9, 2016, The Supreme Court of the United States has described this relationship as follows: ‘‘Puerto Rico, like a state, is an autonomous political entity, sov-ereign over matters not ruled by the [Fed-eral] Constitution.’’ This sovereignty over our internal affairs is exercised by the people of Puerto Rico through our own Constitution under a compact entered in 1952 with the Congress of the United States. This compact was ordained in order to establish the rela-tionship between Puerto Rico and the United States under the principle of the consent of the governed. The Oversight, Management, and Stability Act needlessly, empowers the Oversight Board that it creates with the authority to override the decisions of the Governor of Puerto Rico, and the laws of the Legislature, thus encroaching on the sovereign powers of the Commonwealth rendering nugatory the right to vote of the citizens of the Common-wealth. This empowerment of the Oversight Board by the Congress tramples upon the compact providing for self-government and under-mines the democratic underpinnings of the Commonwealth relationship established with the United States. It will be an irreparable blow even after the Board is terminated. The encroachment powers of the Board are not necessary to ensure compliance by Puer-to Rico with the Fiscal Plan required by the Act. There are other means consistent with respect for Puerto Rico’s sovereignty and self-government to accomplish this. I respectfully request that the members of the Senate have the opportunity to engage in an open debate and be allowed to present amendments so that the bill may respect the democratic process in Puerto Rico and the sovereignty of its citizens. Cordially yours, RAFAEL HERNA´NDEZ COLO´N, Governor of Puerto Rico, 1973–1976; 1985–1992. 
SANJUAN, PUERTO RICO, 27 June 2016. D
EARSENATOR : As candidate for Governor of Puerto Rico for the Partido del Pueblo Trabajador I wish to convey to you our firm opposition to the PROMESA Bill that is now under consideration in the Senate. We believe that the fiscal and economic policies that affect the Puerto Rican people need to be adopted by the representatives elected by the Puerto Rican people. The PROMESA bill violates this fundamental democratic principle as it would create an unelected board that would have consider-able powers to impose or block fiscal meas-ures and policies in Puerto Rico. Such an or-ganism would lack all democratic legitimacy and would only make the resolution of Puer-to Rico’s debt crisis more difficult. Not surprisingly a vast array of organiza-tions in Puerto Rico and the Puerto Rican diaspora have expressed their rejection of this legislation. In order to regain the path of economic de-velopment Puerto Rico requires: 1. An enabling renegotiation of its public debts. We label it enabling since it should en-able Puerto Rico to attain a path of sustain-able economic development (including a transition to renewable energy). This renego-tiation must have as a priority the protec-tion of pensions and essential public serv-ices. 2. An audit of Puerto Rico’s public debts. There are excellent grounds to suspect that a significant portion of this debt is illegal, unconstitutional or otherwise illegitimate. This, in turn, is legal ground for annulling such portions. 3. A suspension of payments on this unsustainable debt until an audit and an adequate renegotiation is completed. 4. Congressional action to protect Puerto Rico against litigation (a stay of legal ac-tions) in the case of suspension in payments. 5. A plan of economic reconstruction that emphasizes reinvestment in Puerto Rico of the profits generated here, including a revi-sion of federal and local tax policies to in-sure that they promote economic develop-ment. 6. Congressional support, including fund-ing, to facilitate such an economic recon-struction, as part of similar projects to ben-efit U.S. working people. Unfortunately, the PROMESA bill includes no provisions that correspond to these re-quirements. Since a major debt service payment is due on the 1st of July we suggest that PROMESA be put aside and a brief substitute measure regarding point 4 above be approved instead, while adequate legislation is considered in the near future.

ENATOR : As former governor of Puerto Rico and former member of Congress I am writing you to express my strong opposition to S 2328 (HR 5278) under consideration of the Senate. All candidates for Governor of Puer-to Rico in the November election, the major-ity of the members of the Puerto Rican House of Representatives and Senate, and the majority of Puerto Ricans (see El Nuevo Dia poll of June 16, 2016) oppose this bill as well. A bill that promises only one thing for certain: to end our Republican form of gov-ernment with its checks and balances. The bill called PROMESA is known in Puerto Rico as La Junta, a name commonly used for military dictatorships in Latin America. Please, do not take all its implications light-ly. It is incredible and a shame that the most important piece of legislation considered by Congress regarding Puerto Rico since the au-thorization and approval of the Common-wealth Constitution in 1952, effectively de-nies basic principles of democracy and self- government, trashes that same Constitution and uses the plenary powers of Congress with a mentality reminiscent of 18th century co-lonialism. That is why I urge you to vote NO on Clo-ture and to support the amendments that have been filed to create a more representa-tive board, limit the overreaching powers of the board, establish a clear and effective path to restructuring, and really protect pensions and basic services to the people. These amendments will eliminate many of the most aggravating dispositions of this bill. And if the amendments are not approved I strongly urge you to vote NO on approval. Those who are pushing to blindly pass the bill acknowledge its imperfections and its excesses. They say Congress will need to do more working the future to help Puerto Rico. But you know, as do they and do I, that the Congressional calendar won’t allow further action on Puerto Rico for a long time. We will be stuck with the con-sequences. It’s imperative to get it right this time. The July 1st deadline is not the end of the world. The bill already has retroactive provi-sions. Don’t make July 1st the end of democ-racy for Puerto Ricans. Thanks, G
OVERNOR ANI´BALACEVEDO -VILA´. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. I know there are more. I think the National Puerto Rican Coalition had one, and I will get to those in a few moments.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES4622 June 28, 2016 
These threads that are constantly seen by the people of Puerto Rico and by other independent services, such as the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which states: 
The board would have broad sovereign pow-ers to effectively overrule decisions by Puer-to Rico’s legislature, governor, and other public authorities [ . . . ] it can effectively nullify any new laws or policies adopted by Puerto Rico that did not conform to require-ments specified in the bill. 
That is not what I am saying. It is not the residents of Puerto Rico who say it. It is the Congressional Budget Office. So not to believe me—this is the nonpartisan entity we use to analyze legislation, and they say the board has broad sovereign powers to effectively overrule decisions by Puerto Rico’s leg-islature. We hear these people crying out from the island to their fellow citizens in the United States: Don’t take away our basic democratic rights to give them to an unelected, unrepresentative control board that can nullify any new laws or policies adopted by Puerto Rico that don’t conform to requirements speci-fied in the bill. Even the bill’s own author noted in a committee report: 
The Oversight Board may impose manda-tory cuts on Puerto Rico’s government and instrumentalities, a power— 
I read this before— 
far beyond that exercised by the Control Board established for the District of Colum-bia. If the Board, in its sole discretion— 
An enormous grant of power. ‘‘In its sole discretion,’’ what does that mean—in its sole discretion. It is pret-ty obvious. The seven of them will get together and decide, well, in our discre-tion, this is, in fact, how this should move forward. The bill cites this 29 times in critical moments in the legislation: ‘‘In its sole discretion,’’ which, in essence, uses the superpowers in this bill. It could choose to close more schools, to shut-ter more hospitals, to cut senior citi-zens’ pension to the bone. I know some people are thinking that will not hap-pen. Well, already the government of Puerto Rico has made some very tough choices to do some of that in order to try to meet its obligations, but it came to the conclusion that there is only so far they can go. But an oversight board, ‘‘in its sole discretion,’’ could make that decision as well. And the powers aren’t limited to just budget and fiscal policy, although I would say those—just those two alone, let’s forget about anything else, budget and fiscal policy—I always think that one of the most important things we do in the Congress is to set the budget for the Nation. We all have budgets in our lives. We may not think of them as budgets, but we have one. It is our in-come by however we derive it. By our work and our salary or our business, by maybe some investments—if we have enough money to make investments, get some interest, rates are very low— however we derive it, that is our in-come. And then we have our expenses: the home we keep for our family; the health care we provide for them; the educational opportunity we want to have for our children to graduate and not graduate with a mountain of debt; taking care of a loved one, a mom or dad or in-law; going ahead and think-ing about our own retirement in the fu-ture; the church, synagogue, or mosque that we tithe to; the charitable con-tributions we make to organizations we believe are important because of the work they do, those are expressions of our values as individuals. The Nation’s budget is an expression of our collective values as a country. What will we provide for the national defense? How will we secure our home-land against acts of terrorism? What will we spend to educate our children, both elementary, secondarily, and how are we going to help students not grad-uate under a mountain of debt but have that human capital that we need to drive America’s competitiveness? How are we going to defend our coun-try across the globe, for example, from ISIS? How much money are we going to spend in research and development so the Alzheimer’s that took my mother’s life can be cured, so we can find the cause and then develop a cure for can-cer and so many other dreaded dis-eases. All of these things, and many more, that we decide collectively as a Con-gress are in the budget is an expression of our collective values as a nation. Yet the people of Puerto Rico are not going to have the right to determine their budget and an expression of their values for the 3.5 million U.S. citizens who call Puerto Rico home. So as the bill states in section 205: 
The Oversight Board— 
They call it oversight. I call it a con-trol board because oversight is one thing, but when you have the control to dictate things, to me that is more of a control board— 
may at any time submit recommendations to the Governor or the Legislature . . . relating to the management of the territorial govern-ment’s financial affairs, including economic forecasting and multiyear fiscal forecasting capabilities, information technology, placing controls on expenditures for personnel, re-ducing benefit costs— 
What does that mean? Reducing em-ployee benefit costs maybe to make them pay more of their health care, re-duce the amount of sick time or over-time they can have— 
reforming procurement practices, and plac-ing other controls on expenditures; the structural relationship of departments, agen-cies, and independent agencies within the territorial government; the modification of existing revenue structures— 
Existing revenue structures. As a member of the Senate Finance Com-mittee, I know what that means. A rev-enue structure is how we derive the money to run our government. That overwhelmingly is in Federal taxes, but there are a whole host of fees and other sources of revenues that we de-rive. This entity is going to be able to modify what that revenue structure is, or the establishment of additional rev-enue structures, which many here would revolt against in terms of having taxes imposed on them, which is tax-ation without representation. That is what we are going to say to the people of Puerto Rico. It is not good for the rest of the American citi-zens, but for the 3.5 million citizens in Puerto Rico: You can have taxation without representation for you—for you— the establishment of alternatives for meet-ing obligations to pay for pensions of terri-torial government employees; modifications or transfers of the type of services that are the responsibility of and are delivered by the territorial government; modifications of the types of services that are delivered by enti-ties other than the territory government; the effects of the territory’s laws and court orders on the operations of the territorial government; the establishment of a per-sonnel system for employees of the terri-torial government that is based upon em-ployee performance standards; the privatiza-tion and commercialization of entities with-in the territorial government. 
That is pretty significant. I know many of my colleagues, particularly the Democratic caucus, have a real concern about the privatization of cer-tain governmental services. Well, we as Democrats are going to vote to undo the minimum wage, undo overtime pro-tections. We are going to vote to allow this unelected oversight board to ulti-mately say there are entities within the government of Puerto Rico that should be privatized. I will talk a little bit later because I know many of my friends on the Democratic side of the aisle are concerned about the environ-ment and environmental sighting of sites. Well, we are going to give them fast-track to go ahead and make all types of environmental sites and by-pass other laws that Puerto Rico has to preserve the environment, but for the people of Puerto Rico, we will leave those environmental laws largely by the wayside. While this section calls these com-ments ‘‘recommendations,’’ section 201 of the bill allows the board to ‘‘adopt appropriate recommendations sub-mitted by the Oversight Board under Section 205(a).’’ So these are more than recommenda-tions because it allows the board to adopt appropriate recommendations submitted by the oversight board under a different section. So if the board de-cides to hold a fire sale and put some of Puerto Rico’s natural wonders on the auction block to the highest bidder, they can. I have visited the island of Puerto Rico many times, and I have seen some of its natural wonders. It has incred-ibly beautiful places. It has places like Vieques, which is also incredibly beau-tiful and is a place for the U.S. mili-tary to perform its bombing runs, and the people of Puerto Rico for years and years supported half of the national de-fense. It could take a part of Vieques

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4623 June 28, 2016 
and say: Well, this should be sold. It could take another part of the natural wonders of Puerto Rico and say it should be sold. So if the board decides to hold the fire sale and sell the natural wonders of Puerto Rico to the highest bidder, they can. They could decide to sell off Las Cabezas de San Juan Nature Reserve in Fajardo or Cueva Ventana in Arecibo or Guanica Dry Forest or to build con-dominiums in San Cristobal Canyon or hotels in Blamenco Beach on Culebra. But what do the Puerto Rican people want? Is that what we want, or is that what an oversight board would want? The fact is, this legislation puts bal-anced budgets and untested ideology ahead of the health, safety, and well- being of children and families, similar to the control board travesty that un-folded in Flint. I don’t know if we want to repeat a mistake like that. Without their voices represented on the control board, there is nothing that the people of Puerto Rico will be able to do. The fact that the Puerto Rican people will have absolutely no say over who is appointed or what action they decide to take is clearly blatant neocolonialism. I am afraid we are opening the flood-gates for Puerto Rico to become a lab-oratory for rightwing economic poli-cies. Puerto Rico deserves much more than to be an unwilling host of untest-ed experiments in austerity. I am not advocating to completely remove all the oversight powers. To the contrary, the legislation I offered actually has some oversight powers. I support helping Puerto Rico make in-formed, prudent decisions that put it on a path to economic growth and sol-vency. But despite its name, the over-sight board envisioned by this bill doesn’t simply oversee; it directs and it commands. It doesn’t assist; it con-trols. In section 201(d)(2), PROMESA makes clear that ‘‘if the Governor fails to sub-mit to the Oversight Board a Fiscal Plan, that the Oversight Board deter-mines in its sole discretion’’—again, undefined, but we have a generic sense of what ‘‘in its sole discretion’’ means. If we read the legislation, the Governor can recommend. The oversight board can reject. The Governor can rec-ommend. The oversight board can re-ject. 
If the Governor fails [ultimately] to sub-mit to the Oversight Board a Fiscal Plan that the Oversight Board determines in its sole discretion satisfies the requirements set forth in [that subsection] by the time speci-fied in the notice delivered under subsection (a), the Oversight Board shall— 
Words of art, ‘‘shall,’’ ‘‘mandatory’’— 
develop and submit to the Governor and the Legislature a Fiscal Plan. 
Then, in section 202(e)(4), PROMESA reiterates that the board has the final say. They have the final say by stating: 
If the Governor fails to develop an Instru-mentality Budget that is a compliant budget by the day before the first day of the fiscal year for which the Instrumentality Budget is being developed, the Oversight Board shall submit an Instrumentality Budget to the Governor (including any revision to the In-strumentality Budget made by the Oversight Board pursuant to subsection(c)(2)) and such Budget shall be (A) deemed to be approved by the Gov-ernor— Not that the Governor approves it; the oversight board shall deem it to be approved. So the oversight board is now the Governor of Puerto Rico and its legislature too— 
(B) the subject of the compliance certifi-cation issued by the Oversight Board to the Governor; and (C) in full force and effect beginning on the first day of the applicable fiscal year. 
So the oversight board goes back and forth with the Governor. The Governor is trying to represent the interests of all of the people of Puerto Rico, 3.5 million U.S. citizens, trying to balance the responsibility for making its pay-ments but doing it in a way that can still help the citizens of Puerto Rico be able to go about their lives, to not have a brain drain, have everybody leave the island because they can take one flight on JetBlue to the United States and find a much better life. Yet, despite those actions in which he is balancing all of this, as is the Legislature of Puerto Rico, at the end of the day, the oversight board says: You know what, in our sole discretion, that doesn’t meet our standards. So guess what. We are going to give you a budget. We are going to deem that the Governor ap-proved this budget, basically, whether he approved it or not. We take it as a section of law that you approved it, and then it will go into full force and effect. Now, in addition to the power to take the budget, which, as I described be-fore, is the single most important doc-ument we use as a Congress because it reflects the interests of the American people and our values as a people, how will we do all of those things which the Governor of Puerto Rico and the Legis-lature have to do for the 3.5 million citizens of Puerto Rico? Now we have gone from an opportunity for the Gov-ernor to try to make his case of what is the best balance for Puerto Rico— but it is rejected at the sole discretion of the oversight board. They will deter-mine what the budget is. They will mandate it, and it will go into full force and effect. Then, in section 203(d), PROMESA al-lows the board make mandatory budget cuts. It says: 
BUDGET REDUCTIONS BY OVERSIGHT BOARD  If the Oversight Board determines that the Governor, in the case of any then-applicable certified Instrumentality Budgets, and the Governor and the Legislature, in the case of the then-applicable certified Territory Budg-et— 
All it means is that the instrumen-tality budgets are subdivisions of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the ter-ritory budget is Puerto Rico, so it is ei-ther one—virtually total blanket con-trol— have failed to correct an inconsistency iden-tified by the Oversight Board under sub-section (c), the Oversight Board shall— 
Words of art meaning ‘‘mandatory’’— 
with respect to the territorial government, other than covered territorial instrumental-ities, make appropriate reductions in nondebt expenditures. . . . 
This is very important, reductions in nondebt expenditures. The oversight board won’t touch moneys that are going to pay debt, but it can make mandatory reductions in nondebt ex-penditures—everything else that goes to the health and well-being of the peo-ple of Puerto Rico—‘‘to ensure that the actual quarterly revenues and expendi-tures for the territorial government are in compliance with the applicable certified Territory Budget’’—the cer-tified budget that the Governor and legislature didn’t pass but that the oversight board passed. So not only do they set themselves up to have total control over that budget, at the end of the day they can make a budget and they can make it mandatory. And by the way, after we tell you this budget should have so much revenue, if that falls short, we have the absolute right to cut the nondebt expenditures, mean-ing the expenditures for everyday life in Puerto Rico, such as public safety, public health, public education, senior citizens, and others. They can cut that, and they can do it in a way that it will become final. To further go on, section 2 of that reads ‘‘with respect to covered terri-torial instrumentalities at the sole dis-cretion of the Oversight Board.’’ Now, territorial instrumentalities or other subdivisions or other government agen-cies can make reductions in nondebt expenditures to ensure that the same revenues and expenses are in compli-ance with the applicable certified budg-et that the oversight board ultimately created and made mandatory. It can in-stitute automatic hiring freezes at the territorial instrumentality. What could that be? That could be a hospital. If there is a hospital association that is part of the territorial instrumentality, hiring in the midst of the Zika chal-lenge, they can freeze it. If there is an instrumentality that deals with the public safety, they can freeze the hir-ing there. Even though the government of Puerto Rico may feel they have a bigger challenge, they can institute automatic hiring freezes. They can pro-hibit the covered territorial instrumen-tality from entering into any contract or engaging in any financial or other transaction unless previously approved by the oversight board, which means that they can never, at the end of the day, act on their own. They have the oversight board that they have to go and ask everything of. In section 204(a)(5), the bill gives the Board the authority to veto legislation passed by the Puerto Rico Legislature and signed by the Governor, stating that ‘‘the Oversight Board may take such actions as it considers necessary, consistent with this Act, to ensure that

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES4624 June 28, 2016 
the enactment or enforcement of the law will not adversely affect the terri-torial government’s compliance with the Fiscal Plan, including preventing the enforcement or application of the law.’’ So in addition to having the power to basically say to the Governor: Sorry, legislature, your budget is not accept-able. Here is the budget we determined is acceptable. This budget is now deemed as mandated, and it goes into full implementation. If we are wrong, by the way—this is the oversight board—in our fiscal estimates, we will have the right to cut nondebt expendi-tures, meaning the predators, the hedge funds, all those, they can get their money, but we can cut nondebt expenditures to ensure that we met the lowest fiscal forecast—totally in the oversight board’s control. And then if they didn’t have enough power as it was, they can veto any leg-islation passed by the Puerto Rican Legislature and signed by the Gov-ernor, stating that the oversight board may take such actions as it considers necessary and consistent with this act. So what is the use of having a Gov-ernor and a legislature if they can’t pass their budget, if they can’t direct even within a fiscal plan that they come up with? It gets vetoed. It gets imposed. The oversight board can cut nondebt expenditures. So why have a Governor? Why go through the farce? In section 204(b)(5), PROMESA also allows the board to override contracts, rules, regulations, and executive or-ders. It states that ‘‘if a contract, rule, regulation or executive order fails to comply with policies established by the Oversight Board under this subsection, the Oversight Board may take such ac-tions as it considers necessary to en-sure that such a contract, rule, regula-tion or executive order will not ad-versely affect the territorial govern-ment’s compliance with the Fiscal Plan, including by preventing the exe-cution or enforcement of the contract, the rule or the executive order or regu-lation.’’ It sounds like a lot of legalistic words. What does that mean? It means that in addition to them passing it and saying: ‘‘This is it; you are going to have to live with it,’’ they are going to be able to make, in addition—if we made the wrong projections, we are going to be able to cut nondebt expend-itures. By the way, if you do something that we think—the unelected oversight board representatives of Puerto Rico— if you pass a rule Puerto Rican society might have to live under or a rule that an entity might have to be obligated to follow or if you pass a regulation that might be for the well-being and health and safety of the people of Puerto Rico or if you pass an executive order, if it fails to comply with what we believe are the policies established by us, we have the right to basically override it and to prevent the execution or en-forcement of it. So this substitutes the oversight board’s opinion of what, in fact, is in the best interest of the Puerto Rican people, even though there is no real representation of the people of Puerto Rico. My first amendment, if given the op-portunity, would be to attempt to strike the right balance and give the people of Puerto Rico at least some representation on this all-powerful board. The current legislation denies the Puerto Rican people any represen-tation on a board that effectively re-places the decisionmaking powers of the legislative and executive branches of their democratically elected govern-ment. Why is it that 3.5 million citizens of Puerto Rico are denied the right to put people on this board through a process of advise and consent within their own government and legislature, with cer-tain qualifications, just like we have qualifications here? Why is it that they can have no say about who is going to dictate their future, in essence, par-ticularly with such an enormous, pow-erful board reaching into every poten-tial aspect of Puerto Rican life? Our amendment adds two additional voting members chosen by the elected representatives of the people of Puerto Rico. The Speaker would still get his two, and the majority leader would get his two. The rest would be the same, but at least the people of Puerto Rico would have some say. (Mr. GARDNER assumed the Chair.) When you have stakeholders involved in the decisionmaking process, you are more likely to be able to have the pop-ulation agree to the tough choices you are going to make. When there is no representation, there is revolt. That is the very essence of how this Nation came to be—taxation without represen-tation, a desire to have a say, a desire to be governed by those who have the consent of the governed. That is what the people of Puerto Rico have had and continue to want to have. These two additional members would be chosen by the President from a list of four candidates submitted by the Governor of Puerto Rico with the ad-vice and consent of the Legislature of Puerto Rico. Republicans will still ap-point a majority of members. From an ideological perspective, what is so wrong about that in terms of giving the people of Puerto Rico some direct say? I personally believe that all members of the board should be chosen by the people of Puerto Rico or their elected representatives, along the standards that we set for membership in terms of backgrounds and abilities to make sure these are people who can help Puerto Rico guide its way through the future. They should come from the island, and that is exactly what my legislation would call for. But I wanted to be reasonable and open to compromise, which is why my amendment only would require two members of a nine-person board to be chosen by Puerto Rico. Certainly, we can all agree that the people who will have to deal with this board should have some say over who is making all of the decisions. If we had an opportunity, my second amendment would keep recommenda-tions made by the control board to be advisory only. If they are called rec-ommendations, the board shouldn’t be able to compel them into a fiscal plan as the bill currently allows. Besides the fundamental flaws with the control board, there is also one of the most sig-nificant parts other than, of course, representation. The board structure here is so omnipotent, and there should be representation from the people of Puerto Rico. But beyond that, the fun-damental flaw of the control bill is that this bill also fails to provide a clear path to restructuring, which is, as I have said several times, the whole purpose of this bill to begin with. The unelected control board created in this bill will have the authority to decide whether Puerto Rico’s debts are wor-thy of restructuring. Let’s not fool ourselves in believing that it is a sure thing that this bill guarantees the island the ability to re-structure its debts. Indeed, section 206 of the bill lists four gatekeeping requirements before any restructuring can occur. Section 8 requires that the oversight board ‘‘prior to issuing a restructuring certification regarding an entity . . . shall determine’’—this is the oversight board—‘‘in its sole discretion. . . . ’’ Again, one of the most important parts of why we are even considering legislation and the only reason we are really considering legislation is to help Puerto Rico through getting access to restructuring in the bankruptcy sys-tem. Yet we create a bar that says that the control board, this unelected group of these 7 people with all these other powers, in addition to that, ‘‘shall de-termine, in its sole discretion, that the entity has made good-faith efforts to reach a consensual restructuring with the creditors; [and] the entity has adopted procedures necessary to de-liver timely, audited financial state-ments; and made public draft financial statements and other information suf-ficient for any interested person to make an informed decision with re-spect to a possible restructuring.’’ Let’s look at the first part of that. ‘‘The entity has made good-faith ef-forts to reach a consensual restruc-turing with the creditors’’—in their sole discretion. So what does that mean? Puerto Rico has a wide number of creditors. As part of this law, basically, the government of Puerto Rico will have to try to come to an understanding with its creditors to see if they could work out some-thing they could agree before getting access to restructuring. But it is the board, in its sole discretion, that deter-mines whether Puerto Rico has actu-ally had a good-faith effort. What if you have members appointed who believe that creditors should get every dime they invested—even the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4625 June 28, 2016 
vulture funds that Senator S ANDERS  was talking about, which bought ex-tremely low at high interest rates and want to maximize their profits—and the oversight board says: No, you haven’t made sufficient good-faith ef-fort to reach a consensual restruc-turing with your creditors; go back. So the Governor of Puerto Rico goes back and tries again. He is weighing all of the elements of what is important for him to be able to govern like any Governor of any State would, with all of the interests of its people in every dimension. So the Governor goes back and tries to work with the creditors, but the creditors know this: You know, this oversight board is on my side on this question, so I can squeeze the Gov-ernor harder and harder and harder, be-cause at the end of the day, it is the oversight board, in its sole discretion, that will make a determination as to whether there have been good-faith ef-forts to reach a consensual restruc-turing with the creditors. We would like to think that this board will be totally aboveboard, that their only interest is doing the right thing for the people of Puerto Rico. But you grant this much power— unelected and unresponsive. If I read the legislation right, they may have to do a report annually or every so often. But for the most part, the control board operates on its own. It has that $370 million of dedicated funding, and dictates how long it will live because it has the ultimate discretion as to whether after 5 years whether Puerto Rico has created a fiscal stability that meets the standard in their sole discre-tion and also that determines whether or not they have access to the bond market in their sole discretion. If not, they can extend their life. When they extend their life, they keep control over the people of Puerto Rico. So whoever is the Governor of Puerto Rico—this will extend far beyond the present Governor. It is not even this present Governor, who will be leaving office at the end of this year. There will be elections, and there will be a new Governor. That new Governor is going to potentially have this enor-mous, omnipotent power in a board that can squeeze it in a way that is simply unfair to the citizens of Puerto Rico. They go on to say in that same vein that not only is it about the Governor of Puerto Rico, but it is whether ‘‘the entity is either a covered territory that has adopted a Fiscal Plan certified by the Oversight Board, a covered ter-ritorial instrumentality that is subject to a Territory Fiscal Plan certified by the Oversight Board, or a covered terri-torial instrumentality that has adopt-ed an Instrumentality Fiscal Plan cer-tified by the Oversight Board.’’ And as it relates to modifying, if they can come to an agreement if there is a modification, only the board can determine if such modification is ac-cepted. But that is not even the tough part. Even if Puerto Rico meets these metrics, the bill doesn’t guarantee the restructuring—not even close. Instead, PROMESA requires a super majority 5- to-2 vote of the control board for any of the island’s debts to be restructured. I grew up understanding basically that the majority rules, and that is a fundamental element in my view. I know that in the Senate we have a 60- vote requirement for closing a fili-buster, coming to an end on a piece of legislation to move forward, but, gen-erally, we come from the perspective that majority rules. Here we have a super majority that has to determine it. By virtue of insisting on a super ma-jority, there is another, terrible, ad-verse possibility that a minority, or three people of the board—since there are seven, you need five—say: No, we are not satisfied; we don’t believe we should go to restructuring, even though four other members of this board, as presently determined, can say: Well, yes, we think Puerto Rico has done enough to go to restructuring. But if those three stay strong and say: No, we don’t think you have done enough to do restructuring, then the minority can thwart the will of the majority and thwart the whole process of why we are in the midst of having legislation in the first place, which again is to give the people of Puerto Rico a chance for restructuring. So that means that these three people, a minority of the board, could derail the island’s intent to achieve sustainable debt repayments. Now, as to sustainable debt pay-ments, that means: Yes, we want to repay our debts, but we have to be able to sustain the health, well-being, and protection of our people at the same time that we pay those debts. That is what restructuring is all about—to per-mit both to take place. Without any authority to restructure its debt, all this legislation will do is to take away the democratic rights of 3.5 million Americans and leave the fu-ture to wishful thinking and a prayer that the crisis will somehow be re-solved. Instead of leaving this critical deci-sion up to the whims of a minority of the board, one of my amendments would provide a clear path to restruc-turing by removing this arbitrary vote requirement. Instead, under my amendment, the government or instrumentality would be able to restructure its debts once it has engaged in good-faith efforts to reach a consensual agreement with creditors, establish a system to develop and make public, timely, audited fi-nancial statements, and adopted a fis-cal plan that was ultimately approved by the board, but done in such a way that takes into account all of the ele-ments that are important for the Gov-ernor and Legislature of Puerto Rico to consider on behalf of its people, as we as a legislative body consider on behalf of the American people. When the main purpose of this bill is to give Puerto Rico the tools to re-structure all of its debts, why would we leave that authority to chance or to the sole discretion of a control board for which only three can deny that op-portunity ever? Now, PROMESA also doesn’t provide enough protections to ensure the health, safety, and well-being of the people of Puerto Rico. The bill only re-quires the board to ‘‘ensure the funding of essential public services,’’ which, when coupled with creditor priorities throughout the bill, leaves the people of Puerto Rico at the mercy of the con-trol board. Even in this Chamber we have debates as to what is the nec-essary funding to ‘‘ensure the funding of essential public services.’’ Some-times it is ideological, sometimes it is partisan, and sometimes it is not par-tisan. Members get together and say: We think there should be more for de-fense, and Republicans and Democrats might very well come together for that. We think there should be more to deal with the Zika virus, and Repub-licans and Democrats might come to-gether for that, but sometimes we dis-agree. The bottom line is that determina-tion to give to an oversight board, in-stead of to the elected Government of Puerto Rico, the authority to deter-mine what is ‘‘ensure the essential funding of the public services.’’ We have debates about that here all the time—robust debates. Why should such a debate and an ultimate determina-tion be left to seven unelected, unac-countable individuals? I have two amendments to fix this if we had an op-portunity for an amendment. One would strengthen the funding require-ment for essential services by requiring funding ‘‘at a level that increases the safety, health, and standard of living of the people of Puerto Rico.’’ Another amendment would require the fiscal plan to reduce factors that lead to economic out-migration from the island. These are two priorities we should all share, Democrats and Repub-licans alike. We saw all too painfully what happened in Flint when budgets came ahead of people. We saw it when budgets came ahead of people. Bal-anced budgets don’t mean much when children are poisoned by the water they drink. It seems to me we have to learn from history and balance fiscal responsibility with the well-being of children and families. Finally, I would plan to offer an amendment to protect senior citizens and avoid an increase in elderly pov-erty. PROMESA currently improves a vague and undefined requirement to ‘‘provide adequate funding for public pension systems.’’ We are having debates about Social Security as a form of a pension system, and we have debates in the States about what their public pension plans are. To suggest that this oversight board—with the words ‘‘provide ade-quate funding,’’ it is going to be their sole discretion as to what adequate funding means. They may think ade-quate funding is enough to pay only

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES4626 June 28, 2016 
half of what recipients are supposed to receive. They may decide that certain categories of recipients may not re-ceive full funding, and others may. When you read the words ‘‘adequate funding,’’ what that funding is goes un-defined with a board that nearly 30 times has ‘‘in their sole discretion’’ the ability to determine what things are. Again, it is an enormous grant of power. So those who have worked a lifetime in Puerto Rico and now are pensioned in Puerto Rico will be at a lesser stand-ard in terms of protection than the bondholders and the hedge funds and all those entities that made huge in-vestments, trying to make a killing. Pensioners have no real protection at the end of the day. Maybe it is true that the present system doesn’t guar-antee them all the protections they want to have, but we do nothing by saying this is your fig leaf. We rein-force in the language of PROMESA the importance of bondholders but mini-mize the importance of pensioners. Our amendment would ensure that senior retirees and pensioners are bet-ter protected from the whims of the control board. After all, retirees in Puerto Rico, who spent 30 years serv-ing the island as police officers, fire-fighters, teachers, and nurses didn’t have any choice but to participate in the pension plan. They had mandatory participation. So you mandate them to participate, but now you are sug-gesting that a control board can make a decision as to what is sufficient and what is not sufficient. Unlike hedge funds, which were able to pick and choose what investments to make and often bought bonds at pennies on the dollar, public servants had to invest in the pension system. They had no way of knowing their nest egg, which they worked their entire lives for, was at risk of being taken away. They didn’t contribute to the fis-cal problems facing Puerto Rico. They didn’t borrow so much or fail to make annual contributions to the fund. They did all the right things. So why should they lose their retirement funds? This is just a small example of the 30 amendments that I filed, which should give my colleagues some idea of how flawed I believe this bill to be and how extensive the Senate debate should be. I know, as all of us know, that success on amendments is never guaranteed. But at the very least—at the very least—the people of Puerto Rico de-serve a thorough and thoughtful debate on the Senate floor and the oppor-tunity to offer amendments. They de-serve more than the Senate holding its nose to improve an inferior solution. I filed the amendments to show the breadth and scope of what is wrong with PROMESA, but I would be happy to agree to the most important ones having an up-or-down vote. I think the 3.5 million citizens of Puerto Rico de-serve at least that. I would hope the majority leader, Senator M
CCONNELL , would stand true to his word when he said as we began this legislative ses-sion that we need to open up the legis-lative process in a way that allows more amendments from both sides— and allow us to call this bill up, I would add—for debate so that we can do what we are elected to do. Here we are, not even talking about having more amendments; we are not having any amendments to this bill. Somehow we think the 3.5 million citi-zens of Puerto Rico don’t deserve the debate we would insist on for any of the citizens of our States or of this Na-tion. I have read through several of the letters that we asked unanimous con-sent to include, and I think they speak powerfully about the views of the peo-ple of Puerto Rico as they relate to what, in fact, should be the process— that there should be an effort to have amendments to change the law that is being proposed in such a way. But there is a history, and I sometimes wonder about our knowledge of Puerto Rico and its people and its history. As I said, I used to serve in the House, and people would ask whether you needed a passport to go to Puerto Rico. I thought they were kidding, but they weren’t. They did not understand that the people of Puerto Rico are United States citizens and have every right and responsibility that any other citizen of the United States has. They can come to the mainland of the United States and have all the full rights and privileges of any other cit-izen. That goes back to the 1900s when, on April 12, 1900, President McKinley signed the Organic Act of 1900, also known as the Foraker Act, which es-tablished the civil government of Puer-to Rico. The President of the United States appointed a Governor and Executive Council, and Puerto Ricans elected their own 35-member House of Rep-resentatives and enjoyed a judicial sys-tem with a supreme court. A Resident Commissioner was to be sent to the U.S. Congress to advise but not to vote. In addition, the Federal laws of the United States came into effect for Puerto Rico, while also formally recog-nizing citizenship. Some at the time argued that the Or-ganic Act of 1900 denied Puerto Ricans the basic rights guaranteed in the Con-stitution and constituted taxation without representation, the very es-sence now, quite a long period of time later—116 years later, we are having that same debate by virtue of this oversight board, and, in essence, the act made a sham of the Democratic principles upon which the United States was founded. So in 1917, President McKinley signed the Jones-Shafroth Act, known as the Jones Act, into law. That law amended the previous Foraker Act and changed Puerto Rico’s status to an organized but unincorporated territory. At this time, Americans were still grappling with what their imperialistic empire meant for them and for their Nation. If Puerto Rico remained a colony, with all the trappings of the Old World, the United States was no better than colo-nial powers of the Old World. So the Jones Act created a bill of rights which extended many U.S. Constitutional rights to Puerto Rico, and that was the beginning of having respect for all of the citizens of Puerto Rico. The bill created a more autonomous government with three branches, much like that of the United States—the Governor, the executive branch, the Attorney General, a commissioner of education. The Governor appointed the remaining heads of executive depart-ments. The Puerto Ricans directly elected the members of the bicameral legislature. Most importantly, the Jones Act stated that all Puerto Ricans are ‘‘hereby declared and shall be deemed and held to be citizens of the United States.’’ Interestingly enough, one of the im-mediate results and motivating factors for the change was the extension of conscription. The Selective Service Act of 1917 drafted 20,000 Puerto Rican sol-diers into World War I—20,000 Puerto Rican soldiers into World War I. The Great Depression severely af-fected Puerto Rico due to its connec-tion to the United States economy. Re-lief didn’t arrive for Puerto Rico until the appointment of Governor Rexford Tugwell in 1941. Governor Tugwell was an economics professor at Columbia University and was part of President Roosevelt’s brain trust of Columbia academics. He was dedicated to bring-ing economic growth to the struggling island. He first suggested the idea of a popularly elected Puerto Rican Gov-ernor to President Roosevelt in 1942. The third principle of the Atlantic Charter prepared by President Roo-sevelt and Prime Minister Winston Churchill read that they respect ‘‘the right of all peoples to choose the form of government under which they will live,’’ and they wished to see the sov-ereign rights of self-governance ‘‘re-stored to those who have been forcibly deprived of them.’’ On February 10, 1943, the Puerto Rican Legislative Assembly, under its president of the senate at that time, Luis Munoz Marin, unanimously adopt-ed a concurrent resolution to ‘‘lay be-fore the President and the Congress of the United States of America the right of the people of Puerto Rico that the colonial system of government be ended and to decide democratically the permanent political status of Puerto Rico as expeditely as possible, imme-diately if feasible.’’ President Roosevelt, in 1943, formed a commission to evaluate the Jones Act. The commission heard Munoz Marin’s grievances, but it didn’t recommend the vast changes he had hoped for. In-stead, it recommended the Puerto Rican people must be consulted—must be consulted—and agree to any further changes to the Foraker Act. The com-mission also indulged Governor Tugwell’s original recommendation

that the Governor of Puerto Rico be elected by the Puerto Rican people. That first formal change to the Jones Act came with the 1947 Elective Gov-ernor Act, and in 1948 Luis Munoz Marin became Puerto Rico’s first popu-larly elected Governor. Munoz Marin was determined to redefine Puerto Rico’s status and his relationship to the United States, and he found a part-ner in U.S. Senator Millard Tydings. By 1945, Tydings was ready to file his third bill for Puerto Rican independ-ence. President Truman sent a special mes-sage to Congress concerning the status of Puerto Rico, calling for legislation that would become known as the Tydings-Pinero bill. It called for a ref-erendum to choose from three options: independence, Statehood, or Common-wealth. That bill died in committee but was an important moment in the his-tory of the U.S.-Puerto Rico relation-ship. The provisions for an associated State set the foundation for the even-tual Commonwealth status of the President of Puerto Rico, and it is that status by which, in 1952, the Constitu-tion of Puerto Rico officially estab-lished the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. Following amendment and ratifi-cation by the U.S. Congress, Governor Luis Munoz Marin enacted the Con-stitution on July 25, 1952. Why do I share that history? Because in that whole process, there was a de-sire to give greater say, to give greater oversight, to give greater consent to the governed—to the people of Puerto Rico. It built slowly to the point at which it got to elect its own Governor and its own legislature. Now we are es-sentially considering a piece of legisla-tion that snatches that away from the people of Puerto Rico and says: No, you don’t have the right to consent of the government. We will govern you as we see fit, through an oversight board that is totally unelected and nonrepresenta-tive. While the people of Puerto Rico weren’t granted U.S. citizenship until 1917, the island has a long and proud history of fighting on the side of Amer-ica long before. I want to talk about that history because it seems to me that if you are worthy of putting on the uniform of the United States, if you are worthy of fighting for the United States, if you are worthy of taking a bullet for your country, if you are worthy of dying for your country, then you are worthy of having the right of the government to be—the con-sent of the government to be governed. This is a long and proud history of the people of Puerto Rico from the in-fancy of our Nation. This goes back— before the Commonwealth, the people of Puerto Rico have been there with us. As far back as 1777, Puerto Rican ports were used by U.S. ships, enabling them to run British blockades and keep com-merce flowing, which was so crucial to the war. In one instance, members of the Puerto Rican militia guided two U.S. warships into harbor, shielding them from attack from a powerful British warship, the HMS Glasgow. De-spite British demands, the Puerto Rican Governor held strong and refused to hand over the ships to the British commander, protecting American sail-ors from imminent capture or worse. Two years later, Puerto Ricans took up arms and joined in an invasion of Pensacola, which was then the British capital of its West Florida Colony. They subsequently defeated a British Army 2,500 soldiers strong, capturing the stronghold and draining resources from the British. It was Puerto Rican soldiers who took up arms in the U.S. Civil War, de-fending Washington, DC, from attack and fought in the Battle of Fredericks-burg. Some served as officers in the Union Army, as in the case of Lieuten-ant Augusto Rodriquez. In 1862, Augusto Rodriquez volunteered for the 15th Connecticut Volunteer Infantry and first held the rank of First Ser-geant and then promoted to 2nd Lieu-tenant on April 12, 1864. He led his men in the Battles of Fredericksburg and Wyse Fork and earned the Army Civil War Campaign Medal. In World War I, approximately 20,000 Puerto Ricans were drafted into the U.S. Armed Forces. The first shot the U.S. fired in World War I was aimed at German ships sailing out of San Juan Bay to attempt to supply enemy U- boats waiting in open waters in the At-lantic. In a separate engagement, LT Fredrick Riefkohl became the first sailor of Puerto Rican descent to be awarded the Navy Cross, after he dis-persed a German U-boat after a torpedo narrowly missed his ship. Lieutenant Riefkohl continued to serve in the Navy after World War I and then went on to command a ship that took part in the Battle of Guadalcanal during World War II. It is estimated that more than 65,000 Puerto Ricans served in U.S. Armed Forces during World War II. Many sol-diers from the island served in the 65th Infantry Regiment that was deployed to the Panama Canal Zone and in Ger-many and Central Europe. Individual awards earned by soldiers of the 65th Infantry Regiment during World War II include: a Distinguished Service Cross, two Silver Stars, two Bronze Stars, and 90 Purple Hearts. The regiment re-ceived campaign participation credit for Rome-Arno, Rhineland, Ardennes- Alsace, and Central Europe. The Korean war. It started with the Revolutionary War. We are up to the Korean war. Sixty-one thousand Puer-to Ricans served in the military during the Korean war. Once again, the 65th Infantry Regiment, known as the Borinqueneers—the segregated mili-tary unit composed almost entirely of soldiers from Puerto Rico—played a crucial and prominent role in the Ko-rean war just as they did during World War I and World War II. Their storied history has been described as ‘‘one of pride, courage, heartbreak and redemp-tion.’’ After disembarking at Pusan, South Korea, in September 1950, the regiment blocked the escape routes of retreating North Korean units and overcame pockets of resistance. In a critical battle near Yongam-ni, the regiment defeated a force of 400 enemy troops, and by the end of October, they captured 921 prisoners while killing or wounding more than 600 enemy sol-diers. Their success led GEN Douglas McArthur to observe that the regiment was showing magnificent ability and courage in field operations. As the Borinqueneers continued to fight and played a major role in the Army’s operations, General McArthur further recognized their service by say-ing this: 
The Puerto Ricans forming the ranks of the gallant 65th Infantry on the battlefields of Korea by valor, determination, and a reso-lute will to victory give daily testament to their invincible loyalty to the United States and the fervor of their devotion to those im-mutable standards of human relations to which the Americans and Puerto Ricans are in common dedicated. They are writing a brilliant record of achievement in battle and I am proud indeed to have them in this com-mand. I wish that we might have many more like them. 
General McArthur. I am proud to say I worked with Sen-ator B
LUMENTHAL and others to make sure the heroic Borinqueneers received their well-deserved and long overdue national recognition of the Congres-sional Gold Medal, the highest expres-sion of national appreciation for distin-guished achievements and contribu-tions to the United States. That reso-lution, by the Senate and the House of Representatives, read: 
That Congress finds the following: (1) In 1898, the United States acquired Puerto Rico in the Treaty of Paris that ended the Spanish-American War and, by the following year, Congress had authorized rais-ing a unit of volunteer soldiers in the newly acquired territory. (2) In May 1917, two months after legisla-tion granting United States citizenship to individuals born in Puerto Rico was signed into law, and one month after the United States entered World War I, the unit was transferred to the Panama Canal Zone in part because United States Army policy at the time restricted most segregated units to noncombat roles, even though the regiment could have contributed to the fighting effort. (3) In June 1920, the unit was re-designated and the ‘‘65th Infantry Regiment, United States Army’’, and served as the United States military’s last segregated unit com-posed primarily of Hispanic soldiers. (4) In January 1943, 13 months after the at-tack on Pearl Harbor that marked the entry of the United States into World War II, the Regiment again deployed to the Panama Canal Zone before deploying overseas in the spring of 1944. 
It goes on to speak to a lot of what I previously said as it relates to the in-credible elements of it. It goes on to say: 
(6) Although an executive order issued by President Harry S. Truman in July 1948 de-clared it to be United States policy to ensure equality of treatment and opportunity for all persons in the armed services without re-spect to race or color, implementation of

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES4628 June 28, 2016 
this policy had yet to be fully realized when armed conflict broke out on the Korean Pe-ninsula in June of 1950, and both African- American soldiers and Puerto Rican soldiers served in segregated units. (7) Brigadier General William W. Harris, who served as the Regiment’s commander during the early stages of the Korean War, later recalled that he had initially been re-luctant to take the position because of ‘‘prej-udice’’ within the military and ‘‘the feeling of the officers and even the brass at the Pen-tagon . . . that the Puerto Ricans wouldn’t make a good combat soldier. . . . I know my contemporaries felt that way and, in all hon-esty, I must admit that at the time I had the same feeling . . . that the Puerto Rican was a rum and Coca-Cola soldier.’’ (8) One of the first opportunities the Regi-ment had to prove its combat worthiness arose on the eve of the Korean War during Operation PORTREX, one of the largest military exercises that had been conducted up until that point, where the Regiment dis-tinguished itself by repelling an offensive consisting of over 32,000 troops of the 82nd Airborne Division and the United States Ma-rine Corps, supported by the Navy and Air Force, thereby demonstrated that the Regi-ment could hold its own against some of the best-trained forces in the United States mili-tary. (9) In August 1950, with the United States Army’s situation in Korea deteriorating, the Department of the Army’s headquarters de-cided to bolster the 3rd Infantry Division and, owing in part to the 65th Infantry Regi-ment’s outstanding performance during Op-eration PORTREX, it was among the units selected for the combat assignment. The de-cision to send the Regiment to Korea and at-tach it to the 3rd Infantry Division was a landmark change in the United States mili-tary’s racial and ethnic policy. (10) As the Regiment sailed to Asia in Sep-tember 1950, members of the unit informally decided to call themselves the ‘‘Borinqueneers’’, a term derived from the Taino word for Puerto Rico meaning ‘‘land of the brave lord’’. (11) The story the 65th Infantry Regiment during the Korean War has been aptly de-scribed as ‘‘one of pride, courage, heart-break, and redemption’’. (12) Fighting as a segregated unit from 1950 to 1952, the Regiment participated in some of the fiercest battles of the war, and its tough-ness, courage and loyalty earned the admira-tion of many who had previously harbored reservations about Puerto Rican soldiers based on lack of previous fighting experience and negative stereotypes, including Briga-dier General Harris, whose experience even-tually led him to regard the Regiment as ‘‘the best damn soldiers that I had ever seen’’. (13) After disembarking at Pusan, South Korea in September 1950, the Regiment blocked the escape routes of retreating North Korean units and overcame pockets of resistance. The most significant battle took place near Yongam-ni. . . . Its success led General McArthur . . . to observe that the Regiment was ‘‘showing magnificent ability and courage in field operations’’. 
I share this because here we are hear-ing the great GEN Douglas McArthur saying that ‘‘the Puerto Ricans form-ing the ranks of the gallant 65th Infan-try on the battlefields of Korea by valor, determination, and a resolute will to victory give daily testament to their invincible loyalty to the United States.’’ So where is our invincible loyalty back to the people of Puerto Rico? PROMESA? False promise? A control board with no representation, one that will determine every aspect of its life, that supersedes the duly elected Gov-ernor and Legislature of Puerto Rico in virtually every significant way? Their invincible loyalty to the United States, where is ours to them? ‘‘And the fervor of their devotion to those immutable standards of human relations to which the Americans and Puerto Ricans are in common dedicated. . . . I wish that we might have many more like them’’ to send. I was really thrilled to go to the Con-gressional Gold Medal ceremony. It was a fitting and appropriate moment to recognize the 65th Infantry Regi-ment, but the way we really would honor them and their sacrifice on be-half of our Nation would be to say that you fought for our collective freedom, and we will fight for your rights to ul-timately govern by your will, not by the will imposed by us. It is pretty amazing to me, if you were to go with me to the Vietnam Me-morial, you would see an estimated 48,000 Puerto Ricans who served in Vietnam. The contributions of those brave soldiers are many. The highest decoration, the Medal of Honor, was awarded to SSG Felix M. Conde-Fal-con, SP4 Hector Santiago Colon, CPT Euripides Rubio, PFC Carlos Lozada, and CPT Humbert Roque Versace. One of the most decorated U.S. military servicemembers in the Vietnam war was Jorge Otero Barreto. He was born in Vega Baja and served five tours dur-ing the war. He participated in 200 combat missions, earned 38 military decorations, including 3 Silver Stars, 3 Bronze Stars, 5 Purple Hearts, and 5 Air Medals. To this day, more than 10,000 sons and daughters of Puerto Rico continue to proudly serve in the U.S. Armed Forces, following in the legacy of those who served before and in the spirit of the Borinqueneers. In fact, just over 2 years ago, Con-gress passed a resolution honoring them for their heroism. During Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, 1,700 Puerto Rican Na-tional Guardsmen were deployed. Four brave Puerto Rican soldiers paid the ultimate sacrifice to the Nation in the Gulf War. Captain Manuel Rivera, a marine, was the first serviceman of Puerto Rican descent to die in Oper-ation Desert Shield. The war in Iraq and Afghanistan was fought with as many as 1,800 Puerto Rican servicemembers. Our volunteer soldiers all face inherited risks of de-fending our freedoms. We honor their sacrifices on Memorial Day. We pay tribute to their dedication, but we are here to take away the rights away from their sons and daughters to have a say over their future, to have the basic concept of what it is to live in a democracy, to have the consent of the government. I share this long history from the Revolutionary War to today, to Iraq and Afghanistan, so that my colleagues understand that the people of Puerto Rico have been just as American as anyone from Colorado or New Jersey or California or New York or Mississippi. They have served on behalf of the Na-tion. They have shed blood on behalf of the Nation, and many of them have committed the ultimate sacrifice on behalf of the Nation. On Veterans Day and Memorial Day, we all rightfully honor those who have served and those who have committed the ultimate sac-rifice. How is it that we dishonor their memories by taking away the consent of the government? Why can’t we have a simple opportunity to show the rest of the world that we are not colonial-ists in our views, that we can have amendments to improve the oppor-tunity for the people of Puerto Rico to feel that they have some say about their future: These are tough times, and we will make tough decisions, but we will come through it together as we always have, and we will have a say in it. Why can’t we do that? What is the urgency, especially with retroactivity in the bill? What is this false urgency of July 1? I think July 1 is important, mind you, but what is the false ur-gency at the end of the day to suggest that you can’t get it right and to, in my view, dishonor the sacrifices that so many Puerto Ricans have made? We remember 20-year-old SPC Frances Marie Vega of Fort Buchanan; SPC Lizbeth Robles, a 31-year-old na-tive of Vega Baja; and Aleina Ramirez Gonzalez, who was 33 years old and grew up in Hormigueros. They gave their lives in Iraq. I am afraid this bill doesn’t honor them. Mark my words, if we don’t seize this opportunity to address this crisis in a meaningful way, we will be right here next year picking up the pieces, but they will, sadly, be pieces because we have not done in this legislation what is necessary to help the people of Puerto Rico. There is a reason we call this country the United States of America, whether it is the terrible flooding that is taking place in West Virginia—I think of my colleagues, Senator MANCHIN and Sen-ator C
APITO . I know what that can do after Superstorm Sandy; I lived it in New Jersey and in our region—or when I cast votes for wildfires in the West, for flooding in Mississippi or that went on with Katrina. There is a reason we call this country the United States of America. There are reasons we are United States citizens. The people of Puerto Rico are also United States citizens, and they need to be treated no less. They need to be treated as citi-zens, not subjects. Once again, I would highlight the na-ture of problems with legislation and what we can do about it. There are five critical flaws that we can correct in the Senate: ‘‘an undemocratic, neo-co-lonial control board—majority ap-pointed by Republicans, none by the people of Puerto Rico.’’ With the gal-lantry and the devotion they have had

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4629 June 28, 2016 
to our country, they should have rep-resentation on the board. It is not too much to ask. ‘‘Prioritization of hedge funds over retirees and essential services’’—noth-ing is wrong with that. ‘‘Lack of a clear path to restruc-turing’’—that is the only reason we are considering this legislation. The only reason we are even considering a bill is to provide a pathway to restructuring. There is no clear pathway. We need a supermajority vote of the board. The majority is supposed to rule, not a supermajority. When you require a supermajority, a minority of the seven- member board—three—could stop the pathway to restructuring. ‘‘Continued disparity in health care funding and tax credits’’—it doesn’t even talk about that in this legisla-tion. By the way, the way we grow prosperity—I am sure Americans watching tonight’s debate would say to themselves: Wow, cut the minimum wage to $4.25 per hour. That is really going to make me more prosperous. It is really going to help me sustain my family. It is really going to be able to educate my kids. It is really going to be able to keep my home. It is really going to be able to take care of mom or dad. It is really going to help me retire. I don’t think they would say that, but for the people of Puerto Rico, that is good enough. If they have to work long overtime, protection—we don’t have any reason to have that. I want to go through some of the spe-cific language this bill has and talk about the consequences of that lan-guage one more time. My colleagues have an opportunity to change this and to be able to do it in such a way that we can get it right and do it well and in time. I have some understanding that the House is considering a pro forma ses-sion. There is no reason why—we have reasonable amendments here, hopefully supported by some of our Republican colleagues—we can’t get this right. They could adopt it in a pro forma ses-sion, or to those who are worried about the July 1 date, there are retroactive provisions of the law, and that retro-activity could encompass any period of time there is a gap, as it does right now. It goes back retroactively to freeze actions going back to December of last year. Under this legislation, the board would have broad sovereign—sovereign is important; it means ‘‘unto itself’’— powers to effectively overrule decisions by Puerto Rico’s Legislature, Gov-ernor, and other public authorities. What is the use of electing our lead-ership, what is the use of electing a Governor and a legislature in a State if we can have a control board that says: Sorry Governor, sorry legislature, this is what the people of Puerto Rico may want, and this is what you may rep-resent, but, no, we know better. We know better through this control board, which doesn’t represent you, by the way, and we will ultimately be able to overrule decisions that you make. If our States were ever in a precarious economic problem, which one of our States would be willing to accept that from a control board? The oversight board can effectively nullify any new laws or policies adopt-ed by Puerto Rico that did not conform to requirements specified in the bill. They can nullify. ‘‘Nullify’’ means the Governor of Puerto Rico opposes— maybe the legislature, as we do, comes up with a legislative idea. They send it to the President, and in their case, they send it to the Governor. He may agree with them and sign it. Guess what. The oversight board can effec-tively nullify any of those new laws or policies if they do not conform to re-quirements specified in the bill—a bill that says nearly 30 times ‘‘in the con-trol board’s sole discretion,’’ which is an enormous grant of power without defining what that means. We know what the general use of ‘‘in your sole discretion’’ means. It is, ‘‘I get to de-cide how I see fit.’’ How could we accept such an enor-mous grant of power for such an impor-tant part of being able to nullify any law the elected representatives of the people of Puerto Rico, the Governor, and its legislature adopt? But that is exactly what this legislation that we are going to vote for does, and a vote for this is a vote to do exactly that—to give this oversight control board the power to nullify whatever the people of Puerto Rico want to see by virtue of their elected representatives, the Gov-ernor and the legislature. I don’t know who among us would cast such a vote if it meant our States would have the will of the people nul-lified for its elected representatives. There are other provisions here as well. I am reading to you, by the way, from the House Natural Resources Committee language. This is not be-cause I am saying it; it is not my inter-pretation of the bill. No, it is what the majority in the House Natural Re-sources Committee put in their bill language, and at the end of the day says: ‘‘The Oversight Board may im-pose mandatory cuts on Puerto Rico’s government and instrumentalities—a power far beyond that exercised by the Control Board established for the Dis-trict of Columbia.’’ They can make decisions that say: You know what, you are spending too much on education; you can do with fewer teachers. You are spending too much even in the midst of the Zika health crisis; you put too much in that budget for health care. Yes, there is a challenge of crime in Puerto Rico, par-ticularly in the urban areas, but you will have to do with fewer police. Tour-ism is important to you as a revenue source, but you are doing too much ad-vertising to try to get people into Puerto Rico, especially in the midst of people’s concern about the Zika virus, but for you to say it is still safe to come to Puerto Rico, it has been taken care of; you are spending too much. The list is unlimited. The oversight board can impose mandatory cuts on Puerto Rico’s government and instru-mentalities, meaning not just the main government but all these subdivi-sions—a power far beyond that exer-cised by the control board established for the District of Columbia. That is a pretty powerful board. Look, this power that we gave is even greater than what the District of Columbia had. So it is like pounding on your chest; we gave this board even more power. Neither the Governor nor the legisla-ture may exercise any control, super-vision, oversight, or review over the oversight board or its activities—no power whatsoever. This is one of the ones that is the most amazing to me because a budget, as I have said several times, is in es-sence the single-most significant thing we do as legislators. How do we provide for the common good? How do we pro-vide for education? How do we provide for health care? How do we provide for retirement? What incentives do we give to business? What do we do to ulti-mately protect our country in the homeland? What do we do to defend our country abroad? How do we promote our foreign policy? All of these things and so much more—what tax credits do we give to our families so they are able to raise their children? What benefits are we going to give so there can be homeownership? How do we provide for retirement opportunities? All of these are contained in the budget, which we provide by the con-sent of the government. We are the rep-resentatives of the government. We provide these. They may not like some of our decisions, but they have that chance to change it when it is time for elections. But here, it doesn’t matter, Governor of Puerto Rico; it doesn’t matter, legislature of Puerto Rico. Yes, you were elected by the people of Puer-to Rico, but the oversight board shall determine in its sole discretion—again, an enormous grant of power—whether each proposed budget is compliant with an applicable fiscal plan. We have a chart that speaks to the fact that if, in fact, there is a back and forth and there is a decision that the Governor’s budget is not sufficient, then at the end of the day, the over-sight board can make that determina-tion. So the oversight board can go back and forth with the Governor. The Gov-ernor, as the elected representative of the Puerto Rican people, is going to think about this: How much money do I need to educate our people? How much money do I need for health care— especially the Zika virus. How much money do I need to protect the citizens of Puerto Rico? How much money will we be able to provide for higher edu-cation so we have the human capital to fuel the economy of the Common-wealth? But he does that in conjunction with the legislature. He has the checks and

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES4630 June 28, 2016 
balances that we do as a legislature with the executive branch—in our case it is the President; in his case, the Gov-ernor—and all of those considerations go back and forth. But at the end of the day, if the oversight board doesn’t like any of the budgets that have been sent to them, they can say: OK. We will deem—first of all, we will devise a budget. We will say the Governor has, in essence, approved this budget, even though he didn’t, and we will deem it to go into full force and effect. And, by the way, if the revenue projections we made—the oversight board—in that budget are wrong, we will be able to make mandatory cuts in the nondebt obligations—nondebt expenditures, which basically means that the money to pay the debts will not be touched, but everything else, even though they are the ones who created the budget, if it falls short, they can arbitrarily and capriciously decide to make cuts in nondebt expenditures. So with respect to the government, they can make appropriate reductions in nondebt expenditures. That means they are going to make decisions about health and welfare and public safety and education and all the things crit-ical for the lives of 3.5 million citizens of Puerto Rico. So that clearly is an incredible grant of power to have mandatory budget cuts. The other issue is, this legislation fast-tracks developments on the island as it relates to energy. Now, many of my colleagues have been so rigorous in their advocacy for making sure we get our energy policy right; that we have the right balance, that we have the right laws to observe the right siting. If we are going to have a new energy plant, what does it look like? Is it gas- fired? Is it coal-fired? Is it some other fuel source? Where is it going to be lo-cated? What air quality emissions are going to be acceptable and not accept-able? If the Governor of Puerto Rico, who knows it best, establishes certain standards, those standards can largely be waived by the control board in an ef-fort to site locations where, in fact, they think it is going to be good for the energy needs of Puerto Rico, but it may not be good for the environment. Why would we delegate on such critical issues that we care about—on the envi-ronment, on education, on the health and well-being of our citizens—why would we never be willing to delegate that ourselves, as a Senate and a Con-gress, to any other entity? We make those decisions ourselves, but we would never delegate it to a control board elected by any of us or the people we represent, but we are willing to do that with respect to the territorial govern-ance in Puerto Rico and make those decisions. Why would we be willing to go ahead, at a time that this Congress is seeking—at least I know Democrats are seeking—to raise the minimum wage, to raise the standard of living for all Americans, to see higher incomes because many Americans feel that re-gardless of all of these macroeconomic numbers—I can tell people all the time that the GDP has grown, that we have the lowest rate of unemployment, that we have seen X number of consecutive years—I think 6 or 7—of private sector job growth, a whole host of economic indicators that would say things are moving in the right direction, but in the average life of many Americans, they feel their wages are stagnant. I think that has given a great rise to the unrest that exists in our national poli-tics because you can tell people: Look at all these macroeconomic numbers, and they say: Yes, but in my life, my wages are stagnant. I haven’t seen a growth in my wages and income. I have seen a growth in my challenges: in edu-cating my kids, in making sure they don’t have a lot of debt; in preparing for retirement, which I am now putting off because there is no way I can retire in that period of time; taking care of loved ones, where people increasingly take care of members of their family— on a whole host of issues. But the peo-ple of Puerto Rico will ultimately have less of a minimum wage for a young part of the population, and they will have less in terms of overtime protec-tion. Why would we, the party that wants to see rising wages and overtime pro-tections, say to the people of Puerto Rico: You deserve less. As guardians of the environment who want to see a bet-ter environmental quality for all of our citizens, why would we say to the peo-ple of Puerto Rico they deserve less? Why would we be some of the strongest advocates of democracy here at home in our own elections and in the world and say to the people of Puerto Rico they deserve less? Why do we work so hard to honor the men and women who served our country in uniform? And we want to see the best health care for them, which they deserve. We want to see them taken care of if they have a disability. We want to take care of their survivors if they ultimately com-mit the ultimate sacrifice. But for the people of Puerto Rico and those who have fought for our country, they don’t get the same democratic rights. They don’t get the same respect. They are citizens. So I don’t want to see Puerto Rico’s natural wonders be subjected to the auction block because a control board says they need to sell that. I don’t want to see an oversight board that doesn’t represent the people of Puerto Rico, ultimately be able to say to its Governor: This is what you are going to have to do if you want to get access to restructuring, if that determination is really arbitrary and capricious be-cause the standards here are not clear-ly defined. The whole reason to get access to re-structuring is the reason for this bill, and without it—without that clear ac-cess and with a minority representa-tion—this bill is so undemocratic in so many ways. It is undemocratic in the way it imposes upon the people of Puerto Rico a board that will control their destiny without any say in it, without any representation; with a control board that can determine and dictate what its future will be in fiscal policy, in cuts to expenditures; how it will be able to deal with siting environ-mental issues; how it will be able to create the pressure because this con-trol board is the gatekeeper to restruc-turing. It can say: Sorry. You really should use those provisions the Con-gress gave you to lower the minimum wage, to provide for exemptions from overtime protections because that is really a pathway to prosperity. In all these respects, this bill is so undemo-cratic and yet it is further exacerbated by the fact that we have an undemo-cratic process here. So I hope my colleagues will—I un-derstand sometimes the deck is stacked against you. I have been around long enough in the legislative process in the House and the Senate to understand those moments, but there are moments you have to stand in the way. I believe that while the deck may be stacked, it can be reshuffled, and it can be reshuffled by voting against clo-ture, so we can have—not to kill this bill but to improve it, to make it more democratic, to have it live within the ideals we all share—Republicans and Democrats alike—what representative democracy is all about, about Jeffer-sonian principles, about the Founders with the consent of the governed. Puer-to Ricans have no less a right to be a part of the consent of the governed and to be governed by their consent. So we can make this better. Now, if a majority of the Senate—if 60 Members of the Senate vote for clo-ture, there is one other procedure I will pursue after cloture, which would still allow us the opportunity for amend-ments to be offered. While I would like to see a process that would allow us to consider a series of amendments, I would certainly seek to embody the major elements of what I think is wrong with the bill in that amendment and to seek that opportunity. I would hope, in the first and foremost in-stance, that we don’t have cloture and that voting against cloture means vot-ing for democracy. It means voting for an opportunity. It respects the will of the citizens of Puerto Rico, the ones I read collectively, including former Governors, present members of the Puerto Rican Congress and Legisla-ture, of civil society—all of those ele-ments that actually believe they de-serve a better day—to be treated better by the U.S. Senate, treated better by the Congress, treated better by their country, and that gives us an oppor-tunity to do that, and we can do it posthaste. I am ready to stay as long as it is necessary. I must be honest with you. I know we all want to rush off to Independence Day, but this isn’t inde-pendence for the people of Puerto Rico. This is how we treat subjects, not citi-zens. So I am willing to stay as long as

necessary to work on amendments to get this process resolved so we can have the right bill at the end of the day. Now, if I fail to convince enough of my colleagues to vote against cloture, then I hope they will join me in a pro-cedural move that would allow me to offer an amendment—and I will explain that tomorrow when I come to the floor. I hope that at that moment, at least we would have the option of vot-ing on an amendment where we could make this bill better—less colonial, more democratic, more respectful of the rights of the citizens of Puerto Rico so that, in fact, we can honor their fealty, their loyalty, what Mac-Arthur said about them in their service to our country, and be seen throughout the world for the values we want for everybody else and that we tell every-body else, to promote democracy and human rights. We need to govern by example, and the way we govern by example is mak-ing sure we have a democratic process and a democratic piece of legislation, small ‘‘d,’’ that allows the people of Puerto Rico to have their say. I see my colleague, the distinguished ranking member of the Natural Re-sources Committee, is here. I am happy to recognize my colleague from Wash-ington State, and I yield for a question. (Mr. DAINES assumed the Chair.) Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I see my colleague from New Jersey has been on the floor for several hours talking about the very important issue that frankly deserves a lot more dis-cussion in the U.S. Senate. It is an issue of great importance to this terri-tory of the United States, and it cer-tainly is an important issue to the peo-ple of the United States of America, whether they understand that or not, because the success of Puerto Rico, fi-nancially, is also tied to how well the United States, as a partner of this ter-ritory, continues to be successful as well. Everybody thinks of the situation with Greece and the European Union. Well, they should also be thinking about the situation in Puerto Rico and its relationship to the United States of America because, if it doesn’t go well for Puerto Rico, I guarantee it is not going to go well for the United States of America. My colleague has been on the floor now for hours talking about the struc-ture of what would be a fair way to enter into a reorganization of the debt. I thank him for coming to the floor and doing this. I think it was probably 7-plus months ago that we had one of the first hear-ings on this issue and tried to get peo-ple to focus their attention on the cri-sis. What kind of authority does the territory have today and what kind of structure should we honor as they con-front this financial crisis? So I just want to put up a couple of charts. I am going to ask that we turn it a little differently so that when I ask a question, my colleague can actually see the chart. I will try to position my-self here on the floor so he might be able to join in this question. I know there are many charts here about the situation, and I want to make sure that I am saying this the right way because part of the issue with the debt crisis is my under-standing that 45 percent of Puerto Rico is in poverty, including 58 percent of the children; that there is a 12-percent unemployment rate, which is nearly double that of our highest State; and that the sales tax is 11.5 percent. People are saying: ‘‘Well, stop gov-ernment spending.’’ They are doing that. That part is being achieved. But the per capita income is almost half of the poorest State in the United States. So I think many people don’t have any idea—when they look at this debt issue, they think, OK, this is where we are going to get money. This is a very difficult issue. Part of the discussion we are going to have next—and that is what I hope my colleagues understand—that whatever happens tomorrow, this issue is not going away. The financial stability of Puerto Rico is going to be a question mark for a long time, and we are going to have to figure out how a territory that has 45 percent of the population living in poverty and these rates of un-employment—how we are going to put them back on the right path? This is the fundamental question. How do we get back on the right path? In the Senate, there are probably 100 opinions about whether you do the earned-income tax credit, go back to tax breaks for manufacturers, what-ever the ideas are, but we are not even at that stage. We are just at the finan-cial crisis stage. The fundamental question is, How do you get out of the financial crisis when the economy of the country is in this hard of a spot? So I ask my colleague, the Senator from New Jersey, if he is aware of these numbers and these statistics. Mr. MENENDEZ. I appreciate the Senator raising the numbers and the statistics. Unfortunately, I am aware of them. They dramatize why what we do here is so critically important for the 3.5 million U.S. citizens who call Puerto Rico home. When the per capita income is almost half of what it is in the poorest State, when the other 50 percent of the popu-lation lives in poverty, including 58 percent who are children—that is why I worry when the control board can make the decision to make mandatory cuts, because how do you help these children? How do you help create a ris-ing income? How do you ultimately, in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, which has doubled the sales tax to 11.5 percent to get income and at the same time has the lowest spending levels since 2005, as you rightly point out, with public employment down by 20 percent—they have made cuts. So it is not that they are not being responsible and making cuts, but a control board that can make even greater cuts with-out any say as to how it happens and where it happens and whatnot, is un-democratic. So I agree. Ms. CANTWELL. I am wondering if my colleague from New Jersey is aware of this point, which I find most inter-esting and am trying to understand. He has been talking about this control board and all the power they are going to have. Do you understand that in this House bill, the members of that control board won’t be paid, but the measure allows them to accept, use, and dispose of gifts, requests, devices of services or property, both real and personal, for the purposes of aiding and facilitating their work? So they literally can ac-cept gifts, but what kind of gifts? Mr. MENENDEZ. Nice. It is a real concern. It is one of the many ill-de-fined parts of the legislation, espe-cially when you have 7 unelected mem-bers ultimately having the fate of 3.5 million people in their hands. You worry about provisions of the bill that seem to allow them to be able to make those types of choices and accept those types of potential gifts in a way that can ultimately lead them to the wrong decisions. So I am concerned about it. Ms. CANTWELL. As I bring up—this is a provision I am just getting famil-iar with, and I am obviously very con-cerned about it. Through the Chair, I would say that I am very concerned about the fact that now we are going to turn over all this authority to people who can accept gifts. I don’t know what that means and who is going to oversee that because they are going to be appointed in a process that I believe will probably be challenged as uncon-stitutional, which will also take the bill to a whole other level of legal un-certainty. But I wanted to go over this and ask about this point. It is my under-standing that they are about $72 billion in debt. For fiscal year 2016, the debt payments will be about $4.1 billion. So making a full payment would require about 25 percent of their annual in-come. My understanding is that a sig-nificant part of this debt is the GO bonds and that various bonds have been issued. The question becomes, if your annual revenue is $17 billion a year, how are you going to reorganize this huge debt when your population is al-ready at a 45-percent poverty rate? So I think all of us, in a normal situ-ation, would say: Let the bankruptcy court figure that out. That is what I would do. I would say let the bank-ruptcy court figure that out because bankruptcy laws in the United States of America are fairer and they decide these issues. They decide what is fair treatment under the law. I certainly would prefer that. I don’t prefer a board of people who can get gifts and make all these decisions because I want legal certainty and I want it now, and I would rather be more prescriptive in the law. Do you know of any way the people of Puerto Rico could pay the $72 billion in debt by themselves? I am trying to

understand what we are asking of the rest of the people who have been inves-tors and if people think we are going to do this on the backs of the Puerto Ricans given the fiscal crisis they are already in. Mr. MENENDEZ. What the Senator said is absolutely right, and this is one of the critical elements of why a clear pathway to restructuring is so nec-essary, because if there is no clear pathway to restructuring and if there are no safeguards over the control board, the determination of how much that control board can say that you have to pursue in terms of payments towards creditors, the effort that they will consider sufficient in their sole discretion about whether they have made an appropriate, reasonable effort to deal with creditors could lead them to an enormous payment, and they are already using a third of every dollar in revenue they have to pay interest. So the whole purpose of this debate or the effort of the bill that is on the floor is to create a pathway to restructuring so that they don’t have to come up with $17 billion—nearly 25 percent of all of their budget—in a way that would crip-ple the essential services for Puerto Rico. So, yes, it is a very legitimate concern. It is one of the reasons we need a clear pathway to restructuring. It is why we shouldn’t have a control board with a supermajority vote nec-essary to achieve that and with arbi-trary standards like ‘‘in its sole discre-tion.’’ Ms. CANTWELL. I wonder, because a lot of this debate has been so focused on the people of Puerto Rico, whom I fully want to support, and I wish this body would engage in a full, robust de-bate, with amendments and a markup. But, there are costs to the U.S. tax-payers. Mr. President, I want to know if my colleague understands that U.S. tax-payers basically can be on the hook for as much as $24 billion over the next 10 years? The United States is already contributing as much as $6.6 billion for their budget as it relates to the Med-icaid costs. And if, again, you don’t have a functioning economy, if you have even more people in poverty be-cause now you have said you are going to put the brunt of the $72 billion on the backs of the Puerto Rican govern-ment and infrastructure, then you are driving more people into poverty. Our costs are going to be real. This is about getting it right with legal cer-tainty so we can move forward because this issue is not going away. They are not all of a sudden going to become healthy when this bill passes. My sense is that what has been passed by the House leads will lead to much legal uncertainty and lawsuits are going to ensue. All my colleagues know that when people disagree, the next thing they do is go to court. What we would rather have is legal certainty so that we can get a resolu-tion of this through the regular bank-ruptcy process. If we don’t do this right, there are billions of dollars that the U.S. economy can be on the hook for because the worse we make it for Puerto Rico, the more money will be involved for the U.S. Government. So while this proposal is not about giving them more money now, it is cer-tainly about what is a fair settlement on this debt. If you ask me, that shouldn’t be decided or discussed here in the Halls of the U.S. Senate or Con-gress just because a bunch of hedge funds have enough money to hire lob-byists to show up here. It should be de-cided through a bankruptcy court, through a normal bankruptcy process, just like it is done in any other place. I wonder if my colleague thinks our colleagues understand these issues that will cost the U.S. economy? Has the Senator heard any numbers similar to this? Mr. MENENDEZ. I appreciate the Senator raising the question. First of all, the Senator from Washington State is absolutely right that it is not a bail-out. A bailout is when I give you money to pay your debts. That is a bailout. A pathway to restructuring is a way for you—in this case, Puerto Rico—to make yourself right with your creditors and find a way to do it in a way that still preserves the oppor-tunity for essential services for the people of Puerto Rico, which is why the pathway to restructuring is so impor-tant, so it doesn’t become a bailout at the end of the day. So it is necessary to have the clear pathway to restructuring so the gov-ernment of Puerto Rico and its people will take care of its obligations, and we will restructure the debt in such a way that it will be responsible and they will take care of it. But in the absence of that, there are real questions as to what the United States is going to do for the 3.5 million U.S. citizens in Puerto Rico. Ms. CANTWELL. I would also say to my colleague that I think the mystery here is some people think that what will happen is it will just get worse in Puerto Rico, and that is true if we don’t make the right decisions. This is a time where we need to come to-gether. We all need to come together and come up with a solution that we believe in. A solution that we know has legal certainty because we are going to have thornier questions to answer. I ask my colleague from New Jersey if he is aware that Puerto Ricans don’t have to stay in Puerto Rico? They don’t have to stay there. In fact, they have come to the United States, and we have seen over the last several years that 300,000 Puerto Ricans have come to the United States of America. That is how many have come. Somebody es-timated for me that last year 80,000 came. So, if they have 45 percent poverty rate and 12 percent unemployment and now you are going to put the people and the government of Puerto Rico at the mercy of four people they don’t even know and they don’t even get a say in the process, I guarantee you peo-ple are going to leave. So that 300,000 people has cost us an additional $4.1 billion in the United States of Amer-ica. Basically, every Puerto Rican who moves to the mainland costs us about $2,500, and we believe that, over the last several years, it has been about $175 million per year. OK. So the reason I am asking this is because I am trying to understand whether our colleagues understand this. The Senator and I have spent a little more time on this. The Senator represents a large Puerto Rican popu-lation, and the Senator has done great service for our foreign affairs and for-eign policy. Does the Senator know whether people understand this issue and the consequences, that they will come to the United States? They will be here, and we have open arms. But there is a different process here, and it is almost as if there is an incentive. I would throw in the Medicaid num-bers here as well and ask my colleague through the Presiding Officer: In Puer-to Rico, the per capita Medicaid spend-ing is about $1,800, but here in the United States, that same Puerto Rican—to cover his Medicaid costs— would be over $5,200. So, if someone is in Puerto Rico and they realize the situation is going to get worse, they don’t think there is a successful economic plan, and they can come to the United States—these num-bers are going to be exacerbated by more and more Puerto Ricans coming here, the cost for us will be getting higher, to say nothing of some of the other challenges. So, personally, I would want Puerto Rico to have the best successful oppor-tunity to restore a robust economy, and it is going to require tough deci-sions. We need to have everybody in the pool when it comes to those deci-sions, and we have to have a fair proc-ess that will stand up in court. I ask my colleague from New Jersey, who is on the Finance Committee, if he thinks people understand the signifi-cance of Medicaid? How much Medicaid money we are going to be asked for? Mr. MENENDEZ. I appreciate my colleague’s point. I will reiterate. First, the people of Puerto Rico are U.S. citizens. They can take a flight to the United States, and they have all the rights, privileges, and responsibil-ities as any other U.S. citizen. They would have full reimbursement on Medicaid or Medicare. They would have protections of the minimum wage, overtime protections, and just about anything that any one of us has in this body or any of the people we represent in this body. So that is right. In terms of the cost, if you have gone to Puerto Rico, as I have many times, you know that the Puerto Rican people don’t want to leave. It is a beautiful is-land. They are beautiful people. They are hard-working and faithful to God and country, as exhibited by all of the military commitments they have had to the United States since the Revolu-tionary War, all through.

It is a beautiful island with idyllic views and natural wonders. The only rain forest in the United States is in Puerto Rico. They don’t want to leave. But if you choke off all of their aspi-rations, all of their opportunities, if you treat them so dramatically dif-ferent—as we do in both tax and health care policy—then, yes, they will have no choice and many will come. When they come, they will have the full privileges of any U.S. citizen and, therefore, it will be more costly. It is ironic that while we are creating a brain drain and a flight of human capital out of the island—which is critically necessary for it to grow again—we are creating the policies with the control board that ultimately go counter to what we would like to see the commitment of the people of Puerto Rico be in Puerto Rico versus fleeing and coming to the United States. Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I would also ask my colleague this. I have read some articles in the press on this subject, and I know in Florida there are so many Puerto Ricans and many in New Jersey as well. But I read this quote from the Miami Herald, that said: ‘‘Some bottom-feeders bought Puerto Rican debt at cheap prices and don’t want a restructuring that might allow repayment at less than the full face value of the bonds—allowing them to make a huge killing at the expense of Puerto Rico’s beleaguered popu-lation.’’ To me, that is what this debate is about. What I am saying is that we need to have a process that is fair and open. A bankruptcy process that people can understand, and that the people who are appointed have that done in a way that meets constitutional chal-lenges and that don’t mire us in debate for the next 2 years while the Puerto Rico economy continues to flounder. I don’t know if my colleague has read press accounts such as this, but I feel that a lot of people don’t know the de-tails about this debt, the size of it, or the background or what people are of-fering or the process that Puerto Rico has been through. They have tried to reorganize this debt. They haven’t been successful because people think that, as long as they have the opportunity, they will not settle. That is why people go through the bankruptcy process. That is why we afford people in the United States of America these same opportunities. But, by not affording Puerto Rico the bankruptcy process, it is going to hurt the people of Puerto Rico and then, in consequence, it is going to hurt the people of the United States, including the U.S. taxpayers, because we will not have gotten this right, and we will not be able to help Puerto Rico get on the right track. I don’t know if my colleague has seen comments like this in other places? Mr. MENENDEZ. I have read what the distinguished Senator from Wash-ington has raised here. There was the direct quote from the Miami Herald— and there are others as well—that bot-tom feeders bought Puerto Rican debt at cheap prices and don’t want a re-structuring that might allow repay-ment at less than the full face value of the bonds, making a huge killing. This is why I am so concerned and why I have focused on it in the course of my discussion about the oversight board— that at the end of the day, it is the final arbitrator of whether or not Puer-to Rico has actually negotiated in good faith with the creditors. The Governor of Puerto Rico and the government of Puerto Rico can try to make all the good-faith negotiations they want. But if at the end of the day they are being squeezed by, among oth-ers, the bottom feeders that you talk about here who bought Puerto Rico’s debt cheaply and wanted, ultimately, the highest price in return to make a killing, they may say: Oh, no, we are going to say to the oversight board: They haven’t worked with us in a rea-sonable manner to try to come to an accommodation. It is in the oversight board’s sole determination whether or not these entities, these creditors like the ones that you have described, ulti-mately are going to be told: No, Puerto Rico has done enough to try to accom-modate you, and, therefore, we are going to try to let them go restructure. That, by the way, needs a super major-ity of vote. So the minority could de-cide that, no, we don’t think that the bond holders have had a reasonable enough offer from Puerto Rico so we are withholding restructuring and, therefore, squeeze the government of Puerto Rico into accepting a deter-mination as to what is the appropriate reimbursement in a way that cannot protect the people of Puerto Rico and their health and well-being. Ms. CANTWELL. I don’t know what Leonardo DiCaprio is doing, but I guar-antee you there is going to be another movie. It is not going to be ‘‘The Wolf of Wall Street,’’ it is going to be about Puerto Rico. People are going to find out exactly how we got into this situation. They are going to find out what a mess it was, and they are going to find out how much it cost our economy. That is what is going to happen. Instead, we could take the time here to have an open amendment process, offer some amendments, and try to get a legal process that is open, that is by the book, and is what we would provide to people in the United States—because Puerto Rico is part of the United States—then we could let a bankruptcy court make these decisions instead of letting a few people make the decision. I think my colleagues don’t under-stand how much is at risk or how much the cost to the U.S. economy could be and certainly how big the debate is going to be that we still have to have in the Congress, in the House of Rep-resentatives, and in the Senate on this issue of how we are going to get Puerto Rico out of this mess. But, if you think you are putting $72 billion on the backs of the Puerto Rican economy, it is not going to help us in our economy, and it is not going to help their economy. We need a more fair restructuring plan, one that gives us legal certainty, one that will not be challenged as unconstitutional, one that doesn’t give gifts to creditors— something that is fair. I know a lot of people think there is some magic date. I read that my House counterpart from the Natural Re-sources Committee said July 1 is not a magic date. He is the one who worked on this bill as it came through the House. He said there wasn’t a magic date. So it is wrong that somehow peo-ple think there is a magic date and that is why we have to buy a policy when you can’t even have an open dis-cussion on amendments. It is very bad policy. Instead, I would prefer us not to be some footnote in some movie in the fu-ture that everybody in America watch-es and tears their hair out over, saying: ‘‘Well, how did that happen? Why did we lose all of that money?’’ These are two important issues. They are important for Puerto Rico, and they are important for the United States of America. I will say I know all our colleagues in the House and the White House are well intentioned. They want to get a resolution. But getting a resolution that might put us into further jeopardy is a challenge given how important it is to make sure that everybody is a part of the process. That is, everybody is part of the debt reorganization. Is it your understanding that with the decision of just four board mem-bers, the board could force Puerto Rico into a position that none of the debt would go? Or they could avoid any of that debt becoming part of that reorga-nization? Mr. MENENDEZ. It is possible that even after a majority of the board, four or five members—well, four members would be a majority—would ultimately put Puerto Rico through a series of hurdles. Let’s say it even meets those hurdles. A minority of the board—three members, I don’t know—may be ideo-logically determined. They may believe the bond holders deserve every last penny, and the pensioners deserve nothing. I don’t know. But since we create overly broad powers, we leave critical elements of the deciding proc-ess in the sole discretion of the mem-bers of this board. Then we say: By the way, it is not a simple majority that will give us and grant us the pathway to restructuring; it is a minority. We need a super majority. And by virtue of having a super majority and minority, only three of those seven members could say: No, we are still not satisfied. We are not giving you access to re-structuring, in which case even though Puerto Rico has done a series of things—maybe even far beyond what they are willing to do for the well- being of their people but to get to re-structuring, to get to the bankruptcy court that my colleague from Wash-ington State is speaking about—they

could still fall flat because that minor-ity could deny them that possibility. Ms. CANTWELL. Through the Chair, I would say to my colleague that I have heard your concerns on the floor, and I look at these problems. I know some colleagues say: I don’t want bank-ruptcy. We want a process here. We don’t want a bailout. Well, by having a flawed bill that ends up in a legal process that declares it unconstitutional means that you are going to end up with a bailout, because we are going to be on the hook. What would be better is that we had all the debt in a reorganizing structure and had a fair process through a bank-ruptcy court for these issues to be de-cided. Like you, I have a concern—on point No. 10 of this chart—about this ap-pointee process because I think it is going to be challenged. People are even admitting that the Department of Jus-tice says it is going to be challenged. We don’t want this process held up for 2 more years, 4 more years because somebody doesn’t think the board has the authority to operate. Why not pass a bill where we are sure that they have the authority to operate? Why not do it the right way so we know the language is legal? I think it is unbelievable that we would say to the people of Puerto Rico—where 45 percent of the popu-lation is in poverty—oh, and by the way, as to this control board, which is going to control everything you guys do, we are going to make you pay $370 million of that cost. Oh, but they could have gifts. I know people were in a hurry. They wanted to get a deal. They wanted to be respectful, but there are a lot of holes in this bill that deserve a debate and deserve an amendment process. I ask my colleague if he is familiar with the fact that a $370 million cost would also be imposed on the people of Puerto Rico for something which they never had a say in. It is not as if they can even submit what they think the plan could be. They could, but the board doesn’t have to consider it. They don’t have to do anything. It is clearly given to this board of individuals. Those four people can come up with a debt process, they can come up with the requirements, and they can come up with a whole scheme. Mr. MENENDEZ. My colleague is ab-solutely right. Even at a time when there is not enough money for essential services and the dramatic cutbacks that have already taken place for the people’s health, education, and safety, we are going to impose upon them a $370 mil-lion obligation. I want to cite to my colleague lan-guage from the legislation that says this: ‘‘Within 30 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the territorial government shall designate a dedicated funding source, not subject to subse-quent legislative appropriations, suffi-cient to support the annual expenses of the Oversight Board as determined in the Oversight Board’s sole and exclu-sive discretion.’’ They get to dictate their own budget. They tell the government of Puerto Rico—by the way, by passing this bill, we tell the government of Puerto Rico: Have a dedicated revenue source for it, and the oversight board will tell you how much they have to spend—they want to spend—and that is what you have to pay for. It is pretty outrageous. Ms. CANTWELL. Through the Chair, I thank my colleague from New Jersey for being on the floor. When I think about the pressure being applied in the halls here, where one individual said, ‘‘you can see the pressure running through the halls of the Capitol’’—we don’t see Puerto Ricans running through the halls of the Capitol. What we see are people who have been struggling with this issue and trying to get the best deal possible. But the best thing we could do for them is give them bankruptcy authority and a clear path that allows them to restructure their debt. That is all we have to do. Then everybody is in on restructuring the $72 billion of debt. They can then move on, and next Janu-ary, we can have a realistic conversa-tion in the Senate. Nothing precludes us from having it. What are we going to do about the 45 percent poverty rate? We will not have added another 10 percent to that. We will not have added to the unemployment rate, which is now higher than the 12 percent. We will still have very, very tough and thorny questions to deal with, but we can have a path for the $72 billion of debt to be successfully restructured with a plan that protects the interests of the U.S. taxpayers. I certainly want to help the people of Puerto Rico, but I also know the views here are going to be varied on what that economic strategy is for Puerto Rico. Everybody is going to have an idea. But there should be 100 percent agreement that all the debt is on the table and that they should be given full bankruptcy authority to get a restruc-turing plan. If our colleagues in the House think this is bankruptcy, well, then, they shouldn’t be afraid of discussing a bill with us from the Senate that is bank-ruptcy. I don’t understand the hesi-tation to get this right because getting it wrong will cost taxpayers here in the United States as well. We want a successful program. We don’t want constitutional challenges. We don’t want this held up. We want a plan to move forward. The challenges are tough enough as it is. So I ask my colleague if he understands what the hurry is in passing this legislation without even allowing amendments or allowing floor debate. Mr. MENENDEZ. Well, I don’t under-stand why there are no amendments or floor debate. And I want to take my colleague’s question to make some final points that I think are important. I have talked to some of our col-leagues, and they have said: Well, what happens if we don’t meet the July 1 deadline, as Senator C
ANTWELL just ref-erenced? Well, first of all, in the legis-lation there is a stay on litigation ret-roactive to December of 2015, meaning that any lawsuit filed after that point would be halted once the stay is en-acted, which is basically when the leg-islation is enacted. There is no prece-dent to suggest that Puerto Rico would not be able to fund essential services while we work to get the bill right over the next few days. And once that stay is enacted, any pending lawsuits, in-cluding those attempting to freeze as-sets, would be deemed unenforceable. So the bogeyman of July 1, if we don’t do this—No. 1, no, there is a stay already in the bill that would cover that. No. 2, I think some of my colleagues have said to me: Well, why did some of the Members of the House of Rep-resentatives who happen to be of Puer-to Rican descent vote for the bill? Well, first of all, not all of them did. Congressman G
UTIE´RREZ of Chicago voted against the bill. But you have to read the statements of my colleagues, for whom I have the deepest, deepest respect. I served with them in the House. I know their passion as it re-lates to Puerto Rico. I know their com-mitment to the people of Puerto Rico. But you have to read their statements. They were tortured, really, as they were coming to this conclusion on the vote. Basically, if you read them, they— well, here is part of Congresswoman V
ELA´ZQUEZ ’s statement. She says: 
The lack of parity for federal funds caused the island government to borrow well beyond its means. . . . The federal government con-tinued to treat Puerto Rico like it was a lab-oratory experiment, creating incentives and then removing them, creating economic chaos and job loss. . . . Wall Street enabled the local government’s addiction to the bond market, coming up with new ways to turn cash flows to debt instruments. . . . [T]his was a . . . keg waiting to explode. . . . [I]t is not the political elite or Wall Street tycoons who suffered, but instead the working-class families who call the island home—my brothers and sisters. 
And then she goes on to say, basi-cally: 
Am I angry that this bill contains labor provisions that are not only obnoxious but counterintuitive? Yes. Am I outraged that Puerto Rico will have to foot the $370 million price tag for an Oversight Board [they] do not want? Yes. 
This is what the Senator from Wash-ington and I were just talking about. Continuing to read her letter: 
Do I believe that the creditors, who lent the island money and bought debt on the cheap, should wait in line behind retirees even though Puerto Rico’s own constitution [might say] otherwise? Yes. . . . Should the bill include incentives for economic growth and parity for health care? Of course, it should. The reality is that Republicans are in control and we have no choice but to com-promise. 
My colleagues have said: Well, why did the Members of the House of Rep-resentatives who happen to be of Puer-to Rican descent vote for it? Basically,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4635 June 28, 2016 
because they had a gun to their head where they were told it is either this or nothing. But that is not what the Sen-ate is all about. The Senate is the in-stitution where one man or woman, standing up for an idea or an ideal, can see their way to make change. We all have that power in this institution. We have the power to make maybe what is the passion of the House at the mo-ment be more tempered in this body. It is the nature of how the Founders structured our two legislative bodies. It is time for us to live up to the highest calling of the Senate and take care of the 3.5 million people of Puerto Rico, who are U.S. citizens, in the right way. So where Congresswoman V
ELA´ZQUEZ or any of my other col-leagues in the House felt they had no choice and no options, that is not what the Senate is all about. That is why the Senate rules permit even the mi-nority at times—although it had been structured in such a way to make it very hard, there are still ways, if we choose as Members, to cast that vote. So as to the July 1 deadline, we have provisions. This provision in the bill is probably the only one I like, at least the way it is written, with a retro-active stay. Secondly, my colleagues didn’t have much of a choice, so they felt that it is either this or nothing. And if it is nothing, then there are real problems. I don’t accept the ‘‘this or nothing.’’ I accept it can be better, as Senator C
ANTWELL has suggested, and I believe that can take place. That hap-pens tomorrow when we come back into session. I hope there will be a vote against cloture to give us that opportunity. If we fail—if enough Members want to vote for an undemocratic bill that goes against some of the very Republican principles of being true to the Found-ers of the Constitution and the archi-tects of our great democracy that sug-gests that consent of the governed is essential, and if they believe, at the end of the day—again, I know many of them have an aversion to corporate welfare—then I would hope they would be true to their principles and vote against cloture. For the Democratic side, I would hope the very essence of our belief in rising wages and overtime protections and also the view of the consent of the governed—we are strong advocates of democracy—and making sure of the en-vironmental protections we fight so hard on—those should not be denied to the people of Puerto Rico. We can vote against cloture and create a process for some reasonable amendments. I am sure there can be agreements to come to that, to have a chance for the people of Puerto Rico to have a say and make the bill better by virtue of a demo-cratic process in the Senate. In the absence of that, if we fail, there is a motion that is available to table an amendment that is in the tree in order to offer another amendment. I hope my colleagues, in a bipartisan fashion, if they think it is so important to get cloture—which I don’t agree with in terms of timing; the July 1 deadline is dealt with; the reasons oth-ers voted for it are amply understood— then there is an opportunity to vote to table one of the amendments that are on the table now and, therefore, create an opening for an amendment where we could at least have that debate and have that opportunity. Those are avail-able, as I understand it, from the Par-liamentarian under the rules. I hope we can achieve that moment. It would be one of the bright moments of the Senate versus one of the darkest moments, I think, if we continue on the road we are on. With that, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. ROUNDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. f

RECOGNIZING HOT SPRINGS NATIONAL PARK Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, in honor of the National Park Service’s 100th birthday year, I want to recognize Hot Springs National Park in Hot Springs, AR. Hot Springs is a world famous tourist destination and it is not hard to see why. Whether it is to take advan-tage of the many recreational activi-ties like hiking or boating or to bathe in the hot, therapeutic waters found in the area, guests have traveled from across the country and around the world to visit Hot Springs. In an effort to preserve its unique hot springs, Hot Springs first became a protected area in 1832 when Congress declared the area a reservation. It was officially des-ignated as a national park in 1921. In the years after it became a res-ervation, Hot Springs experienced ex-tensive economic growth and majestic bathhouses replaced the rudimentary wooden structures surrounding the hot water springs. The remaining bath-house row structures in Hot Springs National Park are now part of a Na-tional Historic Landmark District that sees thousands of visitors each year. But Hot Springs has more than just unique natural features. Over the last century, they have hosted Major League Baseball spring training. They are also home to Oaklawn horse racing, and the notorious gangster Al Capone is even rumored to have spent time in town. Finally, former President Bill Clinton graduated from Hot Springs High School. Hot Springs National Park is a true Arkansas treasure, and the sur-rounding town makes it that much bet-ter. This park has a storied history, but its best days are ahead of it. The hot springs are still flowing, the bath-houses are still open, and the scenery remains breathtaking. In honor of the National Park Service’s 100th birthday year, I encourage you to go out and find your park. f 
APPOINTMENT OF ROSE GOTTEMOELLER TO BE DEPUTY SECRETARY GENERAL OF NATO Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, on June 27th, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg appointed Under Secretary of State Rose Gottemoeller to become the next Deputy Secretary General of the North Atlantic Treaty Organiza-tion. I am pleased to see such a well-re-spected and qualified individual take up a critically important post within NATO. Rose Gottemoeller has distinguished herself at the State Department as the consummate public servant. Her work in the State Department has focused on pragmatically confronting some of the most critical international secu-rity issues the United States faces, in-cluding nonproliferation, arms control, and nuclear security. She is best known for her role in the New START Treaty, when she represented the United States as its chief negotiator. She has been confirmed by the Senate for two different positions at State, first as Assistant Secretary of State for Verification and Compliance and currently as Under Secretary for Arms Control and International Security. In these roles, Rose has been integral to ensuring that American national secu-rity priorities are realized, and I per-sonally could not think of a more com-petent individual who has the requisite experience and expertise to be the next Deputy Secretary General. Under Secretary Gottemoeller will be taking up her post at a critical time for Europe. NATO’s core mission is safeguarding the freedom and security of its 28 members. The freedom and se-curity of Europe today is threatened by Russian aggression on its eastern flank and from the instability and violence emanating from the Middle East and North Africa. The United States and our NATO allies must stand together as one in order to achieve national and international security against these threats. I would like to conclude my remarks by saying, for the record, that I myself have had numerous opportunities to

interact with Rose Gottemoeller dur-ing my time on the Senate Foreign Re-lations Committee and have come away impressed. She has been forth-right when questioned during hearings and briefings. She has been pleasant, upfront, and informative during meet-ings.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO LOUIS ARMENTARO ∑Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, in honor of Independence Day, I wish to recog-nize Louis Armentaro of Park County. Louis is an Army veteran, having served as an infantryman in the 442nd Regimental Combat Team during World War II. We celebrate our inde-pendence and freedom because of peo-ple like Louis, who selflessly put him-self in harm’s way, fighting against tyranny for his country. Over the Fourth of July weekend, I will have the privilege to honor Louis and watch him announce his 68th Liv-ingston Roundup Parade. Louis started this tradition back in 1949, when he re-turned to Montana after serving in World War II. During his time in the special services in Japan, Louis de-lighted in running audio for his fellow soldiers at the GI theatre, ball games, and parades. He is in the Guinness Book of World Records as the ‘‘most durable rodeo parade announcer.’’ His passion for western swing and its abil-ity to transport people inspired him to start Sound Over the West audio and announcing when he returned home. As a child, Louis grew up with a pas-sion for authentic country music. Not only is he one of the greatest curators of this style in Montana, he is also one of the most revered pedal steel guitar players in the country music commu-nity. In the early 1950s, Louis, his brother Frank Armentaro, and their friend Oscar Bergsing started the Rhythm Ramblers, one of the longest living bands in Montana. For decades, they created a soundtrack for count-less swing dancers across the State. While performances from the group are extremely rare today, Louis continues to play his steel guitar every morning. At 91 years old, he is one of the most experienced steel guitar players alive. Louis, with the support of his de-voted wife, Donna, has become a pillar in the Livingston community. Not only have the couple raised and fostered an estimated 30 children, they are an in-dispensable part of the Livingston Roundup Rodeo. For many cowboys and cowgirls, this event is known as Cowboy Christmas; Louis Armentaro is their Santa Claus. He is the dependable voice and orchestrator and is the most recognizable attraction in the rodeo parade. During the parade and the rodeo, Louis blares his curated collec-tion of western swing music. For the last six decades, he has introduced peo-ple of all ages to sounds of American country and the history these songs can teach. I am proud to honor this unique man for his service to his community and our country.∑ f 
TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT GENERAL JEFFERY W. TALLEY ∑Mr. M
CCAIN. Mr. President, today I honor a dedicated soldier and business entrepreneur who has demonstrated il-lustrious service to our Nation while in uniform and in private, public, and aca-demic sectors. After 34 years of service as a model citizen-soldier, LTG Jeffery W. Talley is retiring from his distin-guished Army career. LTG Jeffrey W. Talley served as both the Chief of the Army Reserve and the Commanding General of U.S. Army Re-serve Command from 11 June 2012 to 1 June 2016. Lieutenant General Talley led the Army Reserve through one of the most tumultuous times in its his-tory, guiding the command through the initial phases of a drawdown of forces as it simultaneously supported the war in Afghanistan and executed multiple contingency deployments in support of our Nation. Through his leadership, Lieutenant General Talley has forever changed the mission, cul-ture, and composition of the Army Re-serve. He leaves a combat-tested com-ponent that is more responsive to the Joint and Army warfighting require-ments and contributes directly to our ability to fight and win our Nation’s wars. Lieutenant General Talley is respon-sible for developing and executing crit-ical enabler capabilities to the Joint Force through the use of Army Reserve Engagement Cells and Teams, AREC/ Ts. AREC/Ts assist Army Service Com-ponent Commands and Combatant Commands by integrating Army Re-serve capabilities into plans, exercises, and operational activities and provide reachback capability to the whole of the U.S. Army Reserve Command’s CONUS-based theater enabling com-mands. The Army Reserve possesses the majority of force structure of the Army’s total capability in many key areas to include more than 90 percent of the Army’s Civil Affairs capability, more than 50 percent of the Army’s total logistics and medical capability, and nearly all of the Army’s theater opening capability. Nothing is more important to Lieutenant General Talley than taking care of our Nation’s most precious resource: our soldiers. As a citizen-soldier himself, Lieuten-ant General Talley is acutely aware of the challenges and sacrifices of Army Reserve soldiers as they juggle their service to the Nation, community, and family well-being. This focus on sol-diers and their families, combined with the recognition that soldier support is a critical component of soldier readi-ness, led him to create the Private Public Partnership Office, P3O. P3O has blossomed into one of the DOD’s most effective hiring and readiness generating programs. This indispen-sable capability recognizes the tie that Army Reserve soldiers have with their local communities. Lieutenant General Talley codified the comprehensive transformation of the Army Reserve from a strategic, static component of the Army, to an integral, operational asset critical to the success of the Army’s mission to provide trained and ready forces. Lieu-tenant General Talley’s accomplish-ments will benefit the Army Reserve, the Army, and the Joint Force for years to come. Jeffery Talley and his wife, Linda, have four children: Christopher, Josh-ua, and Matthew—a combat veteran— and Ashley. The Talley family moved 23 times throughout Jeffery’s military career. During those times, Linda vol-unteered as a senior family readiness adviser. For her dedication, she was named ‘‘Volunteer of the Year’’ and re-ceived the Essayons Award for spouses who make significant contributions to the Army Engineer Regiment. I wish Jeffery, Linda, and the entire Talley family the best in their future endeav-ors and the next chapter of their lives. ∑

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: (1) Since 2006, incidents of murder, other violent crime, and corruption perpetrated by armed criminal gangs and illicit trafficking organizations have risen alarmingly in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras (referred to in this Act as the ‘‘Northern Triangle’’). (2) In 2013, Honduras had the highest per capita homicide rate of any nation in the world, with 90.4 murders for every 100,000 people in the country. El Salvador and Gua-temala were in the top 5 countries with the highest per capita homicide rates. (3) Since 2013, El Salvador’s murder rate rose sharply to become the highest of any country in the world in 2015 at 108.5 homi-cides for every 100,000 people, following a dramatic escalation of violence between the country’s 2 largest armed criminal gangs, Mara Salvatrucha (commonly known as ‘‘MS-13’’) and Barrio 18. (4) According to the United Nations Inter-national Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF), the per capita homicide rate for children in El Salvador and Guatemala is higher than any other country in the world. In 2014, 27 out of every 100,000 children were murdered in El Salvador. (5) According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), Hon-duras and El Salvador have the highest per capita female homicide rates in the world. In 2014, 90 out of every 100,000 females were murdered in Honduras (6) In April 2016, UNHCR’s spokesperson stated, ‘‘The number of people fleeing vio-lence in Central America has surged to levels not seen since the region was wracked by armed conflicts in the 1980s. Action is ur-gently needed to ensure that unaccompanied children and others receive the protection to which they are entitled.’’. (7) Since 2013, individuals fleeing the Northern Triangle have sought sanctuary in neighboring countries and there has recently been a 1,185 percent increase in the number of asylum applications from citizens of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras to the Governments of Mexico, Panama, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Belize. (8) Unaccompanied minors from the North-ern Triangle now make up the majority of unaccompanied minors encountered at the international border between the United States and Mexico, with the fastest increase occurring among children younger than 12 years of age. (9) Human smugglers are increasingly re-sponsible for the transit of migrants from the Northern Triangle to the United States. According to the Government Account-ability Office, human smugglers frequently use aggressive and misleading marketing to recruit migrants. (10) Many female migrants face rape and sexual violence during the journey, either from smugglers or others encountered on the route, or risk being trafficked for sex or labor. (11) Challenges to the rule of law in the Northern Triangle have been exacerbated by the limited ability and lack of political will

on the part of governments to investigate and prosecute those responsible for murder. In 2014, approximately 95 percent of murders remained unresolved in Honduras and El Sal-vador. (12) The presence of major drug trafficking organizations in the Northern Triangle con-tributes to violence, corruption, and crimi-nality. The 2016 International Narcotics Con-trol Strategy Report prepared by the Depart-ment of State estimated that ‘‘approxi-mately 90 percent of the cocaine trafficked to the United States in the first half of 2015 first transited through the Mexico/Central America corridor’’. (13) Widespread public sector corruption in the Northern Triangle undermines economic and social development and directly affects regional political stability, as demonstrated by the indictment and resignation of former Guatemalan president Otto Perez Molina on corruption charges. (14) Human rights defenders, journalists, trade unionists, social leaders, and LGBT ac-tivists in the Northern Triangle face dire conditions, as evidenced by the March 2016 murder of Honduran activist Berta Ca ´ceres and the targeted killing of more than 200 such civil society leaders since 2006. Almost none of these cases have resulted in convic-tions. (15) The Northern Triangle struggles with high levels of economic insecurity. In 2014, more than 62 percent of Hondurans, more than 59 percent of Guatemalans, and more than 31 percent of Salvadorans lived below the poverty line. (16) Weak investment climates and low lev-els of educational opportunity are barriers to inclusive economic growth and social devel-opment in the Northern Triangle. (17) Although the CAM Program has ap-proval rates of nearly 98 percent, due to lim-ited resources, of the 8,920 children that have applied for humanitarian protection, only 626 have been conditionally approved and only 368 have entered the United States. (18) Approximately 50 percent of unaccom-panied minors facing United States immigra-tion proceedings receive legal representa-tion. Children with legal counsel appeared at their hearings more than 95 percent of the time. (19) As of May 2016, 492,978 cases were pend-ing before immigration courts, with such cases taking an average of 553 days to reach a final decision. 
SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
It is the sense of Congress that— (1) the United States must address the vio-lence and humanitarian crisis resulting in the elevated numbers of unaccompanied chil-dren, women, and refugees from the North-ern Triangle arriving at the Southwestern border of the United States; (2) the violence and humanitarian crisis has been prompted by the severe challenges posed by— (A) high rates of homicide, sexual violence, and violent crime perpetrated by armed criminal actors; (B) endemic corruption; and (C) the limited ability and the lack of po-litical will on the part of governments to protect their citizens and uphold the rule of law in the Northern Triangle; (3) the United States must work with international partners— (A) to address the complicated conditions in the Northern Triangle that contribute to the violence and humanitarian crisis; and (B) to protect vulnerable populations, par-ticularly women and children, fleeing vio-lence in the region; (4) the Plan of the Alliance for Prosperity in the Northern Triangle, which was devel-oped by the Governments of El Salvador, of Guatemala, and of Honduras, with the tech-nical assistance of the Inter-American De-velopment Bank, represents a comprehensive approach to address the complex situation in the Northern Triangle; (5) the U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America, as articulated by President Obama and Vice President Biden, provides important support for the Alliance for Pros-perity and other United States national se-curity priorities, including rule of law and anti-corruption initiatives; (6) combating corruption in the Northern Triangle must remain a critical priority and the United Nation’s Commission Against Im-punity in Guatemala (CICIG) and the Organi-zation of American States’ Mission to Sup-port the Fight Against Corruption and Impu-nity in Honduras (MACCIH) are important contributions to this effort; (7) the CAM Program provides a safe, legal, and orderly alternative to children fleeing violence in the Northern Triangle; (8) the United States must— (A) expand the CAM Program to ensure the safe and orderly processing of refugee chil-dren in the region; (B) strengthen internal asylum systems in Mexico and other countries in the region to protect and process eligible children and families, including establishing and expand-ing in-country reception centers; (C) expand access to legal representation for unaccompanied alien children facing United States immigration proceedings; and (D) reduce delays in immigration courts, which contribute to misinformation that mi-grants who come to the United States will not be removed; and (9) it is imperative for the United States to sustain a long-term commitment to address-ing the factors causing Central Americans to flee their countries by strengthening citizen security, the rule of law, democratic govern-ance, the protection of human rights, and in-clusive economic growth in the Northern Triangle.

BER WYDEN : The Child Welfare League of America endorses the Families First Preven-tion Services Act. We feel that the legisla-tion offers the important possibility of al-lowing funds to provide vital mental health, substance use and in-home services that could help children stay with their own fami-lies. Current funding for this important part of a continuum of needed services is lacking and we know we must address these areas if we are to strengthen the well-being and out-comes for children and families that come to the child welfare and child protection sys-tems. This legislation provides an important re-authorization of the two Title IV-B programs including an extension of the adoption-kin-ship incentives, court improvement funds, workforce development funds tied to case-worker visits, and the regional partnership grants. The bill includes some needed im-provements to the Chaffee program in regard to the age of eligibility. We hope to work with the Congress and the Administration in the implementation of some of the more challenging aspects of the bill to make sure that the oversight and im-plementation of the residential care parts of this law are carried out in the most effective way possible. In the years ahead we also hope to push Congress on new strategies that can go beyond simply reallocating current child welfare funds and instead invest in what is truly needed and proven effective. Thank you again for your dedication and hard work. Sincerely, C

GETT : One of the Children’s Defense Fund (CDF)’s first reports decades ago was Chil-dren without Homes: An Examination of Public Responsibility to Children in Out-of- Home Care and we have been unrelenting since in our advocacy for children who come to the attention of the child welfare system and their families. Today I offer CDF’s full support of the proposed Family First Preven-tion Services Act. It takes historic and long overdue steps to direct federal child welfare dollars to improve outcomes for vulnerable children and families. I urge you to move to-ward a timely mark up in both the House and Senate so these vulnerable children do not have to wait longer for these important reforms. Especially significant are the redirected funds in the Act for services and programs to assist children at risk of foster care to re-main safely with parents or family care-givers. The proposal ensures quality preven-tion and treatment services for mental health and substance abuse problems that bring many families to the attention of the child welfare system. Such services and treatment are especially critical in respond-ing to the current heroin and opioid epi-demic, and we applaud additional provisions to address this crisis. The proposal also helps strengthen families and protect children by providing them in-home skill-based services. At the same time, it requires states to have a plan to track and prevent child maltreat-ment fatalities. The Family First Prevention Services Act takes important steps to ensure children who need foster care will be placed in the least-restrictive most family-like setting ap-propriate to their needs, and gives special at-tention to children whose emotional or other special needs require residential treatment. It continues to recognize and increase sup-ports for grandparents and other relatives who step in to care for children when their parents cannot; addresses the special needs of pregnant and parenting teens and protec-tions for their children; and offers supports to help older youth transition from foster care to adulthood. There is a continued im-portant emphasis on ensuring permanent families for children. This new proposal builds on your Commit-tees’ work on previous bipartisan and bi-cameral child welfare legislation. In fact, it was 36 years ago today, June 13th, 1980 that the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act was passed by Congress and then signed into law on June 17th. You followed that with the Adoption and Safe Families Act, the Foster Care Independence Act, the Fos-tering Connections to Success and increasing Adoptions Act, and more recently the Pre-venting Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act, to name several, all of which included provisions to begin to better align federal funding with improved outcomes for vulnerable children and their families. The Family First Preventive Services Act now takes important next steps. The Children’s Defense Fund looks forward to working with all of you to make the pro-posed improvements for children in the Fam-ily First Prevention Services Act a reality. Thank you for your continuing leadership on behalf of these most vulnerable children and their families. Sincerely yours, MARIAN WRIGHT EDELMAN , President.

EARCHAIRMAN BRADY AND RANKING MEM-
BERLEVIN: As a nationwide membership or-ganization comprised of many of the most long standing and respected child and family organizations in the county, Children’s Home Society of America is writing in sup-port of your efforts to promote and improve outcomes for many of the hundreds of thou-sands of children and youth who come to the attention of the child welfare system each year, including children in foster care. Over the decades the House Ways and Means Com-mittee, with bipartisan support, has taken significant steps forward on behalf of our most vulnerable children and the Family First Prevention Services Act of 2016 con-tinues those efforts. Allowing funds under Title IV–E of the So-cial Security Act, currently used primarily for out-of-home care for children, to be used for the first time for prevention services to help keep children at risk of placement in foster care safely at home with their parents or with kin is a significant move in the right direction. Kinship caregivers play a critical role in protecting children temporarily while their parents are not able to and also in en-suring new permanent families for children who cannot return home. We strongly support the bill’s recognition of the importance of quality services for these children, which are evidence-based and trauma-informed and the importance of ac-countability in tracking the provision of services and their benefits for children. States at different stages in reforming their systems will also have help training staff for the development and delivery of these new services and putting in place the infrastruc-ture needed to administer and oversee their delivery and child outcomes. The Family First Prevention Services Act over time also will take important steps to

ensure children who need to enter foster care will be placed in the least restrictive setting appropriate to their needs, by targeting fed-eral dollars only on smaller family-foster homes and on other care settings for chil-dren and youth with special treatment needs or those in special circumstances, such as pregnant and parenting teens or older youth in independent living settings. A number of states already have undertaken special ef-forts to reduce the number of children in congregate care and to preserve group care settings for children with special treatment needs. Children and society pay a high cost when the current systems fail to adequately ad-dress the needs of the children who come to the attention of our child welfare systems, nearly 80 percent of whom are victims of ne-glect. We believe that the specific changes proposed will go far in encouraging state and local child welfare systems, private pro-viders, the courts and youth and families who have been involved in the system to work together to achieve significant change for children over the next decade. We look forward to working with you to ensure these new child welfare finance re-forms will truly benefit children who come to the attention of the child welfare system and to continue to explore additional im-provements on their behalf to ensure they all have safe, permanent families. Thank you for your continuing leadership on behalf of these children. Sincerely, S

EARCHAIRMAN BUCHANAN : Children’s Hos-pital of Wisconsin strongly supports the Family First Prevention Services Act of 2016 (H.R. 5456). We applaud your leadership on this important issue. Children’s Hospital of Wisconsin (Chil-dren’s) is the region’s only independent health care system dedicated solely to the health and well-being of children. We serve children from every county in the state and are recognized as one of the leading pediatric health care centers in the United States. In addition, Children’s is the largest not-for- profit, community-based child and family serving agency in Wisconsin. Through our Community Services work, we provide a con-tinuum of care to more than 15,000 children and families annually. This includes family preservation and support, child and family counseling, child welfare, child advocacy and protection, and foster care and adoption services. We strongly support the Family First Pre-vention Services Act that that would allow funds under Title IV–E of the Social Security Act to be used for the first time for evidence- based prevention services to help keep chil-dren at risk of placement in foster care safe-ly at home with their parents or with kin. The legislation represents a significant and meaningful shift in child welfare policy by prioritizing up-front, evidence-based services to keep families together. We know from ex-perience and empirical research that this is important for the healthy development of children. The bill also makes significant advance-ments to integrate interventions and meas-ures focused on child well-being into the child welfare system. Children’s believes that prioritizing and providing account-ability for child well-being, in addition to safety and permanency, is critical to achiev-ing better outcomes for children and society and positioning children to thrive into adult-hood. Children’s is committed to improving the health and well-being of children and fami-lies. We believe the Family First Prevention Services Act will enable the child welfare system to better serve our most vulnerable children and families. Sincerely, AMYHERBST , Vice President, Child Well-Being, Children’s Hospital of Wisconsin.

UCHANAN AND RANKING MEMBER DOGGETT : On behalf of the First Focus Campaign for Children (FFCC), a bipartisan organization committed to making children and their families a priority in federal policy and budget decisions, I am writing in strong sup-port of H.R. 5456, the Family First Preven-tion Services Act of 2016. This bill that makes important policy changes in federal child welfare spending that better support the needs of vulnerable children and fami-lies. Currently, there are 415,000 children in the foster care system, a number that has in-creased by 3.5 percent from 2014. Nearly 31 percent of children placed in foster care were removed due to parental alcohol or drug use, and in some states, the percentage of re-moval due to parental substance abuse is closer to 60 percent. In addition, 57,000 chil-dren in foster care live in group homes or congregate care settings. These children and youth do not have a clinical need to be in such a setting, and should be with families who can provide love and support. The Family First Prevention Services Act of 2016 contains many important provisions that address these poor statistics and will make a significant impact in strengthening and keeping families together. For the first time states will be able to use federal dollars from Tide IV–E of the Social Security Act to provide time-limited, evidence-based serv-ices to families. The services are aimed to help prevent children from entering the fos-ter care system by allowing federal reim-bursement to families for mental health services, substance abuse treatment, and in- home parent skill-based programs. In addi-tion, the bill incentivizes states to ensure that children are placed in family-based set-tings by only allowing federal reimburse-ment after an assessment has occurred and it has been determined that the child should be placed in a quality residential treatment program. The legislation also includes a number of other provisions aimed to reform and strengthen the child welfare system includ-ing the extension of the Tile IV–B program, improving supports for youth transitioning to adulthood, establishing model foster care licensing standards, and calling for a GAO review to examine compliance of states in reinvesting savings from the federal adop-tion assistance reimbursement for special needs kids We look forward to working with you to ensure these new child welfare finance re-forms will truly benefit children who come to the attention of the child welfare system and to continue to explore additional im-provements on their behalf to ensure they all have safe, permanent families. Thank you for your continued leadership on behalf of these children. Sincerely, BRUCE LESLEY , President. f 
CELEBRATING THE EDUCATIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS OF MRS. SYLVIA CRIER 
HON. CEDRIC L. RICHMOND 
OF LOUISIANA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, June 28, 2016 Mr. RICHMOND. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Mrs. Sylvia Crier on receiving the annual New Orleans Excellence in Teach-ing Award from New Schools for New Orleans. The Excellence in Teaching Award is given to a teacher that goes above and beyond for their students and who has a powerful impact on their school community. Mrs. Crier began her teaching career more than 51 years ago when New Orleans public schools were newly integrated. Prior to start-ing her teaching career, Mrs. Crier received her Bachelor’s of Science in English from Tuskegee University and moved to New Orle-ans shortly after—and we’re glad she did. At the young age of 75, Mrs. Crier has taught English, U.S. History, civics and busi-ness to generations of New Orleans students. Currently, the students of McDonough 35 High are lucky enough to have a teacher who is in-vested in not only their educational achieve-ment but also their professional and personal development. Mr. Speaker, I join with the Crier family in celebrating Mrs. Crier’s dedication to her stu-dents and receiving this achievement.

Dentistry. He has served in private practice and has continued to deliver professional den-tal care and oral care education to the citizens in his local community for the past 28 years. Dr. Donald is the first dentist from Region 12 of the AGD and the Mississippi AGD to hold an elected national office and to become the national President of this organization. The Academy of General Dentistry was founded in 1952 with the foundational core principal of continuing education for general dentists to advance their knowledge, edu-cation and training in all fields of dentistry through post-graduate continuing education. The Academy of General Dentistry is the second largest dental professional organiza-tion in North America with over 40,000 mem-bers consisting of 62 constituents in the United States and Canada with student and international members. Members of the Academy of General Den-tistry are required to acquire continuing edu-cation as a membership requirement and can obtain a coveted Fellowship and Mastership in the AGD. Fellows in the AGD make up 15% of the membership and only 5% of the membership obtain the coveted Mastership award. Dr. Don-ald obtained the Mastership award in 2009. Dr. Donald has been a member of the AGD since 1988 and has served in both appointed and elected positions of leadership within the AGD. He was appointed to the Legislative and Governmental Affairs Council in 2000 and served as chair from 2003 to 2006. He was elected as Regional Director of Region 12 and served for five years and two as chair. He has been elected to serve as AGD Speaker of the House, and in 2013 he was elected as the AGD Vice President. Dr. Donald was instrumental in the concep-tion, formulation and implementation of the AGD advocacy strategic plan including the in-troduction and initiation of the AGD Advocacy fund and the AGD Hill Day and has helped guide the AGD advocacy efforts for the gen-eral dentists for the past 16 years. Dr. Donald received the first Dentist of the Year award in his home state of Mississippi in 2010 and was recognized as the 2016 Alum-nus of the Year for the University of Mis-sissippi School of Dentistry. He is the first and current project chair of the Mississippi Mission of Mercy which has provided 1.3 million dol-lars of free dental care to 2,800 patients in Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in commending Dr. W. Mark Donald, DMD, MAGD for his service as the 52nd President of the Academy of General Dentistry, and also to acknowledge the significance that the Acad-emy of General Dentistry has had on the pro-fession of dentistry, the oral health care deliv-ery system of the United States, and the im-portance of oral health care for all our citizens.

HONORING THE RETIREMENT OF BRAD DOHERTY 
HON. FILEMON VELA 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, June 28, 2016 Mr. VELA. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to rec-ognize the accomplishments of a remarkable community member, Brownsville Herald Photo Editor Brad Doherty. Mr. Doherty recently re-tired after nearly 33 years of dedicated service to the newspaper and the Brownsville commu-nity. Born in the Texas Panhandle town of Slaton, Mr. Doherty dreamed of becoming a basketball player, but traded in his basketball for a camera in college. Mr. Doherty earned a degree from the University of Texas at Aus-tin’s College of Fine Arts before joining the staff at The Brownsville Herald. Mr. Doherty was passionate about telling stories through photojournalism. For more than three decades, Mr. Doherty has been present at community events including football games, graduations, and festivals like Browns-ville’s famous Charro Days Fiesta. In addition to working full-time at the news-paper, Mr. Doherty served as an adjunct pro-fessor of photography at the University of Texas at Brownsville, he became a highly re-garded professor. He was a mentor to many aspiring journalists and many of his photo-journalism students went on to become his co- workers at The Brownsville Herald. Despite his busy days, he always found a way to spend time with his wife, Anna, daugh-ter, Kenya, and their Weimaraners. The family often traveled to Real de Catorce, Mexico where Mr. Doherty would photograph scenes from both the bustling village and the stark plains surrounding it. Brad Doherty left an indelible mark on The Brownsville Herald and the community it serves. Mr. Doherty is an immensely talented photographer and teacher, and he will be missed by his colleagues and by all those who have seen Brownsville come alive through his photography. f 
FRANKIE’S STORY 
HON. BRENDAN F. BOYLE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, June 28, 2016 Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in memory of Frankie Prout, a young man from the Port Richmond area of Philadelphia described by his devoted mother Jacqueline as happy and well-loved by everyone who knew him. I also rise in honor of the 129 victims of drug overdose deaths each day; 78 of those from opioids. In February of 2012, at the tragically young age of 20, Frankie succumbed to a heroin overdose in a half-way house, preceded by his addiction to Percocet—an addiction that began two years earlier with a prescription from the dentist. After repeated attempts to seek reha-bilitation and attempts to qualify for meaningful treatment, Frankie was denied the resources he needed to overcome his addiction. We must remind one another of people like Frankie, and put names and faces to the near-ly 30,000 people who fall victim to opioid over-dose each year. But we must also take action to make that tragic number zero. We as elect-ed leaders must not abandon any more vic-tims like Frankie. And we cannot stand by as mothers like Jacqueline bury their children. THE COMMODITY FUTURES TRAD-ING COMMISSION’S POSITION LIMITS LITERATURE REVIEW HON. K. MICHAEL CONAWAY 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, June 28, 2016 Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to submit into the C
ONGRESSIONAL RECORD an important document related to the ongoing work to finalize a position limits rulemaking at the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commis-sion (CFTC). The document, an unpublished draft literature review prepared by the CFTC’s Office of the Chief Economist (OCE), is titled ‘‘Analysis of the Various Economic Studies Cited in Comment Letters in the Position Lim-its Rulemaking.’’ The House Committee on Agriculture (Com-mittee) conducted oversight of research prac-tices at OCE based on a report published by the CFTC’s Office of Inspector General (CFTC OIG). As part of this oversight initiative, the Committee requested, obtained, and reviewed documents and information related to the CFTC OIG’s report. As a result of its oversight efforts, the Committee obtained a literature re-view on position limits that was never finalized or circulated to the full commission. Having reviewed the draft literature review prepared by the CFTC’s own economists, I believe it presents a comprehensive overview of the current state of economic research on excessive speculation and an objective anal-ysis of the potential utility of position limits. The document discusses in detail the ongoing and vigorous debate among economists about what constitutes excessive speculation and what, if any, impact it might have on prices and volatility in the commodity futures mar-kets. In addition, the document summarizes and provides a brief analysis of many of the most important academic studies cited by commenters and utilized by CFTC staff in drafting the proposed rule. On June 14, 2016, I requested that CFTC Chairman Massad make this document public because I believe the insights and information contained in this report will benefit the general public’s understanding of and ability to com-ment on the proposed rule. On June 17, 2016, Chairman Massad declined on the grounds that (i) the document was a summary of stud-ies submitted during the comment period and, (ii) it was never intended to be public. The document, however, is much more than a summary of studies submitted during the comment period; it also is a wide-ranging ex-amination of how to define excessive specula-tion, how to measure it, and how it may im-pact markets. For reference, I have included the entirety of the conclusion section here: 
Economists debate whether ‘‘excessive speculation,’’ meaning a link between large speculation positions and unwarranted price changes or price volatility, exists in these regulated markets, and if so to what degree. The question presented is a surprisingly dif-ficult one to answer. All the empirical stud-ies on this question have drawbacks, and none is conclusive. This inconclusivity is not surprising. It is inevitable, given the eco-nomic uncertainties that inhere in the data and the complexity of the question. There are many theoretical and empirical assump-tions, and often multiple leaps of faith, that

are needed to transform and interpret raw market data into meaningful and persuasive results. There is no decisive statistical meth-od for establishing evidence for or against position limits in the commodity. Those that use Granger causality method-ology tend to conclude that there is no evi-dence of excessive speculation or its con-sequences on price returns and price vola-tility, and many industry commenters op-posed to position limits used this method-ology. But that methodology is peculiarly sensitive to model design choices, and above we have analyzed designed modelling deci-sions that may have affected the ultimate conclusions of these studies. Moreover, there are countervailing Granger studies showing a link between large speculative positions and price volatility. And studies such as Cheng, Kirilenko, and Xiong, Convective Risk Flows in Commodity Futures Markets (working paper 2012), indicate that some Granger studies may mask the impact of ex-cessive speculation in times of financial stress. Those that use comovement and cointegra-tion methods tend to conclude there is evi-dence of deleterious effects of ‘‘excessive speculation.’’ Yet comovement just tests for correlation, not causation, and a correlation between large financial trading in the com-modity markets and price changes and vola-tility could be driven by a common causal agent such as macroeconomic factors. Those studies that use models of funda-mental supply and demand reach a whole host of divergent opinions on the subject, each opinion only as strong as the many modelling choices. In this way, the economic literature is in-conclusive. Even clearly written, well-re-spected papers often contain nuances. It is telling that Hamilton, Causes and Con-sequences of the Oil Shock of 2007–2008, Brookings Paper on Economic Activity (2009), has been cited by both proponents and opponents of position limits. What can be said with certainty is summa-rized in the Commission’s NPRM: that large speculative positions and outsized market power pose risks to a well-functioning mar-ketplace. These risks may very well differ depending on commodity market structure, but can in some markets cause real-world price impacts through a higher risk premium as a component of total price. There are also economic studies indicating some correla-tion between increased speculation and price volatility in times of financial stress, but this correlation does not imply causation. There are studies indicating that in certain markets, such as crude oil, or certain time periods, such as times of financial stress, the impact of excessive speculation may be greater. These findings are all exceptions to the general rule that increased participation of speculators should generally be expected to lead to better price discovery and less un-warranted price volatility. Comment letters on either side declaring that the matter is settled in their favor among respectable economists are simply in-correct. The best economists on both sides of the debate concede that there is a legitimate debate afoot. This analysis paper documents that the academic debate amongst econo-mists about the magnitude, prevalence, and pervasiveness of the risk of outsized market positions has reputable and legitimate stand-ard-bearers for opposing positions. 
While I have my own opinion about the util-ity of a position limits regime, my push to make this document public has nothing to do with a disagreement over the outcome of this specific policy debate. I believe that to make informed decisions it is important that law-makers, policy makers, and the public have access to the best available information. This literature review, much like other whitepapers, studies, and analyses published by OCE, pro-vides such information in a manner that is clear and understandable. It is my hope that this information will be used to continue to improve our understanding of derivatives markets and the regulatory rules we enact to govern them. For this reason, I am making this report public prior to the July 13 closing date of the comment period for the CFTC’s position limits rulemaking. The cover memo, full literature review, and all of the correspondence between the CFTC and the Committee regarding this document are available on the Committee’s website at http://agriculture.house.gov/uploadedfiles/posi-tionllimitslanalysis.pdf.

OMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE , Washington, DC, June 14, 2016. Hon. T
IMOTHY G. M ASSAD , Chairman, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Washington, DC. D
EARCHAIRMAN MASSAD : The House Com-mittee on Agriculture is conducting over-sight of research practices at the U.S. Com-modity Futures Trading Commission’s (CFTC) Office of the Chief Economist (OCE) based on a report published by the agency’s Office of Inspector General (OIG). As part of this oversight initiative, the Committee re-quested documents and information related to the OIG’s report and discovered the exist-ence of a draft literature review on position limits that was never finalized or circulated to the full commission. I write to request that you direct CFTC staff to finalize and make public this report for use in the Com-mission’s ongoing work on the position lim-its rulemaking. On February 18, 2016, the OIG published a report following up on a 2014 review of OCE research programs. After interviewing OCE economists, the OIG decided to expand its re-view of OCE to include research topic selec-tion due to allegations that the Chief Econo-mist has refused to permit research on topics relevant to the agency’s mission, including position limits, and economists have begun limiting their research proposals to non-con-troversial topics based on a perception that the Chief Economist will not permit research that may conflict with the official positions of the CFTC. The OIG’s findings were deeply troubling, and the Committee requested documents and communications related to the OIG’s inves-tigation for additional oversight. Among the documents the Committee received was a draft literature review summarizing and ana-lyzing economic studies cited in comment letters on the position limits rulemaking that was sent to your office on June 30, 2015. The version we have seen is labeled draft number 20, but does not appear to have been submitted for final review within OCE after it was shared with your office. I have reviewed the document, and I be-lieve it presents a comprehensive overview of the current state of economic research on ex-cessive speculation and an objective analysis of the potential utility of position limits. The report discusses in detail the ongoing and vigorous debate among economists about what constitutes excessive speculation and what, if any, impact it might have on prices and volatility in the commodity futures markets. The authors of this report raise im-portant questions about whether position limits are an effective tool for limiting the effects of excessive speculation. They also highlight the market stabilizing effects of speculative activity and suggest that sup-pressing such activity may carry unintended risks, such as disruptions to liquidity and price discovery. I appreciate your work on the recent sup-plement to the proposed position limits rule-making. Your proposal takes steps towards addressing several of the concerns that have been raised before both this Committee and your agency. As stakeholders and market participants review the new language and file their comments, this report, which puts the best economic literature in context, may help clarify what can and cannot be accom-plished in the final rule. Position limits are a complex regulatory tool and their impact on markets is uncer-tain. Given the sweeping nature of this rule-making and the intense debate it has pro-voked since its inception, this even-handed report prepared by the Commission’s own economists should serve as an invaluable re-source for the Commission and the public. Therefore, the Committee requests that you finalize this report before continuing with the next steps in the rulemaking process. The Committee on Agriculture is the prin-cipal authorizing committee for all matters related to agriculture and commodity ex-changes in the House of Representatives and ‘‘shall have general oversight responsibil-ities’’ as set forth in House Rule X. Please respond to this request in writing on or before June 24, 2016. Your response should specify the date by which the lit-erature review will be finalized and made public. If you have any questions about this request, please contact Emily Wong or Paul Balzano of the majority staff. Sincerely, K. M

EAR MR. CHAIRMAN : I am writing in re-sponse to your letter of June 14, 2016 regard-ing the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s (‘‘CFTC’’ or ‘‘Commission’’) rulemaking concerning position limits on de-rivatives. As you note in your letter, the position limits rulemaking (‘‘proposal’’ or ‘‘rule’’) is a very important one. As with all rulemakings, the Commission is following a transparent and thorough process. No cur-rent Commissioner was in office when the initial position limits rule was proposed, and therefore we have taken the time to listen to market participants and consider the pro-posal very carefully. The Commission has made extensive efforts to ensure the public has ample opportunity to comment on the proposal and has extended the public com-ment period multiple times. As part of any rulemaking process, all comment letters are made publicly available on the Commission’s website. Commission staff routinely summarize these comments, which can be helpful to Commissioners and staff because comments are often volumi-nous in detail. In the case of this rule, some of the comment letters referenced studies re-garding position limits or related matters conducted by third parties, including aca-demic researchers, economists and trade or-ganizations. The draft document you men-tion in your letter is a summary of studies submitted during the rulemaking comment periods. A majority of these studies were submitted prior to the publication of the proposed rule in December 2013 and were summarized and listed in that 2013 proposal. While staff summaries of public comments (or material referred to in the comments)

are internal Commission documents and not themselves published as part of the final rule, I can assure you that, consistent with normal practice, any final rule will summa-rize the comments we receive, including those comments that refer to third party studies, just as was done for the proposed rule published in December 2013. I appreciate the complexity of the issues surrounding the position limits rule, and the importance of thoroughly and fully consid-ering public comments. I have made it a pri-ority to finalize a position limits rule this calendar year and believe we are making good progress toward that goal. If you have further questions, please con-tact me or Cory Claussen. Sincerely, T

IN MEMORY OF MEMPHIS POLICE K–9 OFFICER GUNNER 
HON. STEVE COHEN 
OF TENNESSEE  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, June 28, 2016 Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join with the people of Memphis who are mourning the loss of a member of the Mem-phis Police Department’s K–9 unit. Gunner, a fearless German Shepherd, served with his partner and handler Sgt. Roo-sevelt Twilley for five years before retiring in 2010. In 2009, Gunner risked his life to help ap-prehend a suspected thief and saved his han-dler’s life in the process. Gunner was stabbed 10 times during the incident. After emergency surgery and a blood transfusion, he returned to duty just two months later. Last week, Gunner was laid to rest by his brothers and sisters of the Memphis Police Department in recognition of his life-long serv-ice to the safety of Memphis. As a State Senator I offered legislation to in-crease the penalty for shooting police dogs like Gunner because an attack on a member of the K–9 unit is an attack on all our police, and we need to protect those who protect us from harm. We are grateful for their service and we mourn the loss of K–9 officer Gunner.

HONORING MR. FRANK OMATSU 
HON. JUDY CHU 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, June 28, 2016 Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mr. Frank Omatsu, an outstanding citizen who has done so much for his country and his community in his 92 years. A native Californian, Frank was born in 1924 in Los Angeles, where he lived until the outbreak of World War II. His family was then uprooted and forced across the country to the Jerome War Relocation Center, a Japanese imprisonment camp in Arkansas. Frank was only a high school student at the time, and yet despite the cruelty of his imprisonment, he never wavered in his dedication to his country. When the imprisonment camps were finally closed, instead of returning back to the life from which he was uprooted, Frank chose to join the U.S. Army. He served in the Military Intelligence Service, 77th Division, where he served overseas in the Philippines and Japan. Even after his family was treated like pris-oners, he chose to fight for his country. When Frank returned home from the war, he immediately went back to school to com-plete his education, and attended Los Angeles City College and the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). After graduating from UCLA, he became the first ‘Nisei,’ or second- generation Japanese American, to manage the Sumitomo Bank of California. As a man-ager, Mr. Omatsu provided loans and support to Japanese Americans returning from intern-ment camps, helping them to get back on their feet financially. Always an active leader in his community, Frank was Finance Officer for Commodore Perry Post 525 of the American Legion Veterans organization. In 1985, he served as chairperson of the Little Tokyo Cen-tennial Time Capsule. This time capsule, bur-ied beneath a tree at the Japanese American Cultural and Community Center in Little Tokyo, Los Angeles, preserves the culture and history of the Japanese American community in Los Angeles at the time. The following year, Frank founded the ‘Astronaut Ellison Onizuka Memorial Board’ to honor the first Asian Pa-cific American to reach outer space who was tragically killed in the Challenger Space Shut-tle in 1986. The board celebrates the life and upholds the legacy of Astronaut Onizuka as an inspiration to future generations of Asian Pacific Americans. Building upon his legacy of serving others and improving his community, Frank was one of the ‘‘magnificent seven’’ original board members of Keiro Senior Healthcare, a not- for-profit organization dedicated to enhancing the quality of senior life for the Los Angeles Japanese-American community. Keiro has provided quality care, bilingual resources, and culturally sensitive programs to the elderly Japanese American community. The Keiro fa-cilities themselves have become a cornerstone of the community, where families would gather to celebrate their rich cultural history. As one of the original board members of Keiro, Frank used his finance and banking knowledge to ensure the success of the orga-nization, which has been operating since 1961. He served on the board for 42 years, helping to make Keiro a cherished and valued institution in the Japanese American commu-nity in Los Angeles and across the state of California. Along with his colleagues, friends, and all those whose lives he impacted through his work, I am so grateful to Frank Omatsu for his lifelong dedication to Keiro and the Japanese American community. I congratulate him on this milestone, and wish him many more!

IN CELEBRATION OF THE 300TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE TOWN OF STRATHAM 
HON. FRANK C. GUINTA 
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, June 28, 2016 Mr. GUINTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 300th anniversary of the Town of Stratham, New Hampshire. Though formally incorporated as a town in New Hampshire on March 20, 1716, Stratham saw settlers on its lands formally known as Squamscott Patent going back to the 1600’s. I know that these early settlers must have felt the way its current residents feel today, that it is a beautiful part of our historic state, with a great deal to offer families and businesses starting out there. Stratham has been the home to many influ-ential leaders for the State of New Hampshire including former Members of the U.S. House of Representatives David Barker Jr. and Jo-siah Bartlett Jr., former Members of the U.S. Senate Daniel Clark and Maurice Murphy Jr., and Paine Wingate who served in both the U.S. Senate and U.S. House of Representa-tives. Thomas Wiggin also hailed from Stratham and served as the first governor of what was then called the Upper Plantations of New Hampshire. Many of these influential fig-ures from Stratham went on to make great contributions to the Granite State, and their family names still remain strong in the resi-dents here today who proudly carry on in the name of their forefathers. For the past 300 years, this town has been a landmark of independence and success, and the residents of Stratham should be proud of all that they’ve accomplished throughout its storied history. I am pleased to join with the citizens of Stratham as they mark this great milestone for their town and community, and it is truly an honor to represent them in Con-gress. f 
HONORING THE CAREER OF DETECTIVE JOSEPH SMOLA 
HON. JOHN KATKO 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, June 28, 2016 Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay trib-ute to the esteemed career of Detective Jo-seph Smola, who served over 28 years with the City of Syracuse Police Department. Detective Smola was appointed to the Syra-cuse Police Department on September 16, 1985, and served commendably in various units within the Department until his retirement in March of 2014. As a result of his excellent service throughout his 28 years of service, he received two Divisional Commendations, twelve Bureau Commendations, twelve De-partmental Commendations, The Meritorious Service Award in 2004, as well as several let-ters of appreciation. During my time as a federal prosecutor I had the opportunity to serve with Detective Smola as part of the Syracuse Gang Violence Task Force. Detective Smola was an integral part of this effort for more than a decade and his work helped to drastically reduce the gang presence in some of our community’s most violent neighborhoods. For over 28 years, Detective Smola served with great dignity, loyalty and devotion to our community. He has truly helped to make the City of Syracuse a better, safer place for its citizens.

RECOGNIZING ALZHEIMER’S AND BRAIN AWARENESS MONTH 
HON. CHRISTOPHER H. SMITH 
OF NEW JERSEY  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, June 28, 2016 Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, as we close out the month of June, Alzheimer’s and Brain Awareness Month, it is critical to note that the effort to enhance treatment and find a cure for Alzheimer’s must be prioritized year round. Yet, there is no better time to re-flect upon the progress that has been made in this effort, the long road ahead and opportuni-ties just around the corner. According to the Alzheimer’s Association, 5.4 million Americans suffer from Alzheimer’s or related dementia and as the baby boom population ages, that number is expected to skyrocket. This devastating disease impacts patients and families alike. Over 15 million family members and friends provide over 18 billion hours of unpaid care to their loved ones annually, at tremendous emotional and often financial sacrifice. Alzheimer’s is a progressive disease that af-fects an individual’s cognitive abilities. While Alzheimer’s is the sixth leading cause of death for Americans, it is the only disease among the ten leading causes of death in America that cannot be prevented cured or even slowed. Alzheimer’s is also the most expensive dis-ease in America and incurs catastrophic costs to Medicare and Medicaid—approximately $236 billion in 2016. On average, Medicare spends three times more on seniors with Alz-heimer’s than without. To ensure that optimum care is provided to every Alzheimer’s patient, we need to find in-novative ways to improve quality of care. To this end, I have introduced legislation—the Health Outcomes, Planning, and Education (HOPE) for Alzheimer’s Act—which will amend the Social Security Act to add an additional one-time benefit for care planning services for Medicare beneficiaries newly diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. This one time comprehensive care planning session will arm patients and caregivers with the facts, prognosis, and most efficacious treatment plan. It is our moral imperative to support individ-uals with Alzheimer’s and their caregivers. We have an obligation to care for our citizens as they age and we must support them as they struggle to face the challenges of this disease. HOPE fulfills this obligation by ensuring quality of life for Alzheimer’s patients. These patients are often hospitalized because co- morbidities, such as diabetes, become uncon-trolled when patients are no longer able to manage their own care. In other instances, medicines prescribed to control the symptoms of Alzheimer’s can be rendered ineffective when patients, unequipped with sufficient in-formation, use them in conjunction with other prescriptions. Care planning can ensure this does not happen, ensuring that symptoms are controlled to the extent possible, so patients can have the best quality of life. Not only would HOPE improve health out-comes for Alzheimer’s patients, it would also mitigate the huge, unnecessary costs associ-ated with preventable trips to hospitals and emergency rooms. This is especially impor-tant, as Alzheimer’s is the most expensive dis-ease in America and presents a unique cost to Medicare and Medicaid. A cost estimate commissioned by the Alz-heimer’s Association and conducted by Healthsperien, a DC based health care con-sulting firm, indicated that as a result of this legislation, net federal health spending would decrease by $692 million over the 10-year pe-riod. The cost estimate is based on a study track-ing 1,756 patients newly diagnosed with de-mentia, depression or mild cognitive impair-ment, broken into two cohorts, one cohort re-ceiving comprehensive care planning and chronic care management through a collabo-rative care model and the other cohort not. The study showed a significant savings for those patients enrolled in the collaborative care model as opposed to their peers and based on the study, the HOPE benefit is esti-mated to have a per person savings of $600 and per person cost $200 for a 3:1 return on investment. Passage of my legislation, which has 291 bipartisan cosponsors, will empower individ-uals with much-needed information to outline their future treatments and care—giving pa-tients HOPE, and a plan for their future. In closing Mr. Speaker, I urge my col-leagues to support my bill and hope that the momentum brought to this issue during Alz-heimer’s and Brain Awareness Month carries forward.

TRIBUTE TO RANDY LANOIX 
HON. GARRET GRAVES 
OF LOUISIANA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, June 28, 2016 Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Randy Lanoix of Donaldsonville, Louisiana, as he nears the end of his term as the 111th Chairman of the Independent Insurance Agents & Brokers of America, also known as the Big ‘‘I.’’ Randy was installed as Chairman of the Big ‘‘I’’ in September 2015, and he has been a strong, thoughtful and charismatic leader for inde-pendent insurance agents across the country. Randy has a strong track record in the inde-pendent agency system, serving as president of the Independent Insurance Agents & Bro-kers of Louisiana (IIABL) in 2001 and as the Louisiana representative on the Big ‘‘I’’ na-tional Board of Directors from January 2005 to September 2010. He received the Lou Daniel award, which is the highest honor bestowed by the IIABL, in 2010. Randy is also a past re-cipient of the ‘‘Mr. Chairman’’ award for his work as Louisiana’s legislative chairman and his work with the Louisiana state legislature. On the national level, Lanoix has served on the Professional Liability Committee, the Trust-ed Choice
®Board of Directors, numerous task forces, and two terms on the Government Affairs Committee, where he was chairman of State Government Affairs. In these leadership positions, Randy has always sought to pro-mote an environment where independent agents, in both Louisiana and across the country, can continue to thrive in their busi-ness and represent their customers. Randy is the owner of the Lanoix Insurance Agency in Port Allen, Louisiana which is lo-cated in my congressional district. He has been married to his wife Nell for more than 36 years, and they have two sons, Bryan and David, who work in the family agency along-side their father. Their family also includes daughters-in-law Leslie and Michelle along with their grandson Brooks and their grand-daughter Riley. I am pleased to join Randy’s colleagues from across Louisiana and the nation in con-gratulating him as he finishes his term as Chairman of the Big ‘‘I.’’ f

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, June 28, 2016 Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of the 70th anniversary of the chartering of the U.S. Department of Energy’s Argonne National Laboratory, located in my district in Il-linois. Argonne traces its beginnings to experi-ments by the renowned physicist Enrico Fermi, who led researchers in creating the world’s first self-sustaining nuclear reaction. From its initial mission to fulfill the promise of the atom as a new energy source, Argonne has grown into a multidimensional laboratory addressing a range of major scientific and so-cietal needs, still however, with the primary mission to invent, innovate, and protect energy technologies for the nation. The lab’s work now spans the spectrum from basic research to applied science in areas including physics, materials and chem-istry, math and computer science, life sciences, renewable energy, nuclear energy, energy storage, transportation, establishing energy surety and securing critical infrastruc-ture. And Argonne remains on the cutting edge as it extends its expertise into new sci-entific endeavors including protein character-ization, nanomaterials, molecular engineering and urban sciences. I am pleased to have in my district a na-tional laboratory that is a longstanding global

leader in battery research. Argonne continues to license its chemistries for use in bestselling electric vehicles and has positioned itself to meet the emerging storage needs of the new electric grid. This unique history, combined with its role as convener of a regional eco-system of governments, universities, non-prof-its, industries and other public and private en-tities delivering innovative research and tech-nology, means Argonne National Laboratory is a big reason why Chicago and the Midwest will be a focal point in the impending clean en-ergy revolution. I am also proud to say that not only is Ar-gonne home to Mira, one of the world’s fastest supercomputers, and the Advanced Photon Source, the brightest X-ray source in the Western Hemisphere, but that ongoing up-dates to these and other user facilities at the lab will help maintain U.S. leadership in sci-entific discovery. Argonne is not only a scientific, but also an economic engine for my district and the state of Illinois, as the lab employs some 3,000 peo-ple, attracts thousands more as visitors and scientific facility users, and spends approxi-mately $300 million annually through procure-ments to a diverse group of large and small businesses to support its overall mission. Finally, by employing more than 400 grad-uate and undergraduate students each year and annually hosting approximately 3,000 ele-mentary, middle, and high school students for various programs, the lab is also an important educator and contributor to the STEM pipeline on which future prosperity of this country de-pends. Clearly, scientific research is fundamental to the progress of society. The 70th anniversary of the chartering of Argonne National Labora-tory is an excellent opportunity to reflect upon the contributions this world-class institution has made, is making, and is poised to make in the years to come—across an array of es-sential, life-changing disciplines. Mr. Speaker I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the 70th anniversary of the char-tering of Argonne National Lab and I yield back the balance of my time. HONORING SHERIFF CARLOS CARRIZALES 
HON. FILEMON VELA 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, June 28, 2016 Mr. VELA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to rec-ognize the late Sheriff Carlos Carrizales for a lifetime of distinguished service to Bee County and the state of Texas. A selfless public serv-ant, he spent his entire career in law enforce-ment and served as Bee County Sheriff for the past 12 years. He will be remembered as an admired community leader. In addition to his steadfast professional service to Bee County, Sheriff Carrizales was active in several community organizations. He served on the advisory board of the Safe and Drug Free Schools and Communities program and was a dedicated supporter of the Boys & Girls Club. Sheriff Carrizales also enjoyed success in sports. He earned a football scholarship to Monterrey Tech, where in 1976, his team won the Collegiate Football National Champion-ship. He earned the title Texas State Powerlifting Champion in 1980 and was in-ducted into the Beeville Sports Hall of Fame in 2005 and 2006. He is greatly missed by Pat, his wife of 35 years, his two sons, Philip and Andy, their families, and the thousands of Beeville resi-dents he served and protected every day. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me today to honor Sheriff Carrizales for his life-time of service to the Bee County community.

HONORING CHARLES S. WEISS, PH.D. 
HON. JAMES P. McGOVERN

CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor my dear friend Dr. Charles Weiss on the occasion of his retirement from the Col-lege of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massa-chusetts. Dr. Weiss, also known as ‘‘Chick,’’ has been a member of the College of the Holy Cross family for forty-one years. He joined the faculty as a member of the Department of Psy-chology, which he later chaired. As a member of the faculty, Chick was a well-loved pro-fessor, a sought after author, an inquisitive re-searcher, and an active participant in multiple College committees. Chick also served the College in several administrative roles, most recently as Director of the Office of Strategic Initiatives and Corporate and Foundation Rela-tions. In this capacity, Chick has been pivotal in ensuring that the intellectual and financial assets of Holy Cross were available to numer-ous deserving organizations throughout my district. While Chick has certainly left his mark on the College of the Holy Cross, it is his positive impact on Central Massachusetts that is truly remarkable. Through both his words and deeds, he has made the City of Worcester a better place. Among his many contributions, I know that he is most proud of his work with the Nativity School of Worcester, an all-schol-arship middle school for economically dis-advantaged boys that he helped found. With-out him, there would be no Nativity School. Not only did Nativity School present him an award in recognition of his many contributions, the school named the award after him, and every year presents the Charles ‘‘Chick’’ Weiss Award to a member of the community who lives up to Chick’s commitment to serv-ice—not an easy task. In addition to his service to the Nativity School, Chick has served on the board of the Central and Western Massachusetts Chapter of the American Red Cross; the Children’s Friend; The EcoTarium; the Greater Worcester Community Foundation and the Abby Kelly Foster School, just to name a few. I am par-ticularly grateful to Chick for his leadership role on the Blackstone Valley Visitors Center Advisory Committee, a project that is particu-larly near and dear to my heart. I am pleased to congratulate Chick on his retirement from the College of the Holy Cross. I know that his wife, Gayle, and son, Joe, will enjoy spending a bit more time with him, but I also know that his work in the City of Worcester is not done. Congratulations Chick on a professional life well lived, and best wish-es for a happy retirement, and all that is ahead of you.
