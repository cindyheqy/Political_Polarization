PRAYER Chaplain David L.

May this day, that right, not be ignored or undertaken lightly. As citizens all over this land go to the ballot boxes, give to all of us the sense of high privilege and joyous re-sponsibility. Help those who will be elected to public office to understand the real source of their mandate, a mandate given by no party, received at no place of voting, but given by Your grace; a mandate to govern wisely and well; a mandate to represent God and truth at the heart of the Nation; a mandate to do good in the name of Him under whom this republic was estab-lished. We humbly ask You, Lord our God, to lead America in the paths where Your spirit would have our Nation walk to do the tasks which You have set before the United States so may we together seek happiness for all our citizens in Your holy name, You who create us all equal in your sight, and therefore, brothers and sisters. In Your holy and matchless name I pray. Amen. f

HONORING SAMUEL BEAMON 
HON. ELIZABETH H. ESTY 
OF CONNECTICUT  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, November 6, 2018 Ms. ESTY of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor and celebrate the life of one of Waterbury’s finest sons, Samuel K. Beamon, Sr., who died this past Sunday, October 28, 2018. With Sam’s passing, we lost a great American, a proud Marine, and I lost a very dear friend. A graduate of W.F. Kaynor Technical High School in Waterbury, Sam enlisted in the United States Marine Corps in 1965 and was deployed to South Vietnam. He became a hel-icopter mechanic, crew chief, and aerial gun-ner, flying more than 320 combat missions. Sam earned numerous awards while in the Marine Corps including 16 Air Medals and Combat Air Crew Wings, the Combat Action Ribbon, Navy and Presidential Unit Citations, and the Good Conduct Medal. He wrote about his time in the Marine Corps in his book, Fly-ing Death: The Vietnam Experience, which was published in 2007. After returning home, Sam worked at Pratt & Whitney before answering the call to service again—but this time, as a police officer. In 1970, he joined the Waterbury Police Depart-ment. He was the first African American Acci-dent Investigator, radar operator and instruc-tor, and member of the SWAT Team. As the first African American promoted to Lieutenant in the Waterbury Police Department, Sam paved the way for others. He mentored many in the department, including Vernon Riddick, who later became the first African American Police Chief of Waterbury and now West Hart-ford, and Patrick Riddenhour, now the first Af-rican American Police Chief of Danbury—both of whom credit Sam Beamon with teaching them how to be an effective leader. Sam’s leg-acy includes his work to improve the lives of the youth of Waterbury. He served many years as the Commander of the Juvenile Divi-sion and was active in the Waterbury Depart-ment of Children and Families Extended Team and ‘‘Project Hometown Support.’’ He served on both Governor Rowland’s and Mayor O’Neill’s juvenile task forces to identify the issues pertaining to the youth of Connecticut, implement policies to protect young people, engage in practices that promote character building opportunities for at-risk students, and work with law enforcement officials to encour-age dialog in the community to identify issues that negatively impact at-risk students. Sam was inducted into the Connecticut Vet-erans Hall of Fame in 2011. He was extremely active in the veterans’ community serving as the Commandant of both Department of Con-necticut and the Brass City Detachment of the Marine Corps League. He was a life member of VFW Post 201 and a member of American Legion Post 135. In 2014, he was named Chairman of the City of Waterbury’s Veterans Memorial Committee. Sam also served for six years on my Veterans Advisory Board, helping me better serve veterans in Connecticut and across the nation. As a founding member of the ‘‘Forever Wave Program’’ that visits local schools to teach proper flag etiquette, he enjoyed pass-ing on the love of his country, the military, vet-erans and Gold Star families. He was 19 years old when his Kaynor Tech classmate, Michael Kight, was killed in Vietnam. Upon Sam’s return to Connecticut, he honored his friend Michael and his Gold Star Family by visiting the local schools during Memorial Day and Veterans Day to share his stories of serv-ice to inspire the students to serve others as well. Sam’s commitment to improving the lives and welfare of others extended well-beyond his involvement in veterans’ organizations. A man who lived through some of the most divi-sive times in our country’s history, Sam sought to inspire and unite today’s youth. As a boy himself, he was a member of the country’s first Young Marines Detachment, founded at VFW Post 201 in Waterbury. He knew the im-portance of community service, inspiring self- confidence, healthy living, and being true to one’s moral compass. He understood the ad-versity some of our youth face in overcoming social, political, and economic barriers, but knew it can be done with hard work, a positive attitude, and moral grounding to overcoming all challenges. He mentored countless stu-dents, teaching them about the value of edu-cation, and what it means to believe in one’s country, and answer the call to service. For Sam, his call to service and leadership may have begun but did not end with his time in the military. It meant giving back to Waterbury, the city that gave him so much. A leader in every sense of the word, Sam was honored at our Black History Month Congressional cere-mony in Waterbury in February 2016. His re-marks were touching; a perfect blend of self- reflection, humility, and his ironic sense of humor. In July 2016, he became the first Waterburian and African-American to receive UNICO National’s John Basilone Freedom Award. Even though UNICO was founded in Waterbury, CT in 1922, it had yet to bestow this prestigious award on one of its native sons. While Sam may be the first non-Italian to receive the John Basilone Freedom Award, I wonder if UNICO heard the story about how he found a way to visit his good Italian friend Colonel Chiarella in the hospital. When hos-pital staff told Sam that only immediate family was allowed to visit the Colonel, Sam didn’t miss a beat. He told them that he was the Colonel’s brother. This story perfectly encapsulates just who Sam was: he was the man who would stand by your side, offering his unwavering support when you needed him. To veterans across the State of Connecticut and his family and friends in the City of Waterbury, Sam was a man of conviction, honor, and leadership. Although cancer took his life far too soon, it did not take his spirit. His infectious positive energy brought joy to the people around him. When I brought him apple cider donuts just a week before he died, he was full of plans about ev-erything we had to do to set the country straight. He was and will always be my favor-ite Marine. Sam Beamon helped teach me how to care for those who have worn the uniform, how to fight with everything you’ve got, and how to cherish every day we are blessed to be on this earth. He never gave up. He never gave in. Nor should we. God speed, Sam Beamon. Our prayers, our thanks, and our love go with him.

HONORING STATE SENATOR JEAN LEISING 
HON. LUKE MESSER 
OF INDIANA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, November 6, 2018 Mr. MESSER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today, on behalf of the entire 6th Congressional District of Indiana, to recognize State Senator Jean Leising for her contribution to our state. For nearly 18 years, Jean has represented East Central and Southeast Indiana with honor and integrity in the Indiana State Senate. As the Chair of the Senate Committee on Agri-culture, Jean has been an advocate for farm-ers in her district, leading on issues that im-pact family farms across Indiana. She also continues to be a strong voice on education policy in the Indiana General Assembly, work-ing to ensure our students and teachers are well equipped to succeed. Our state is better off today because of her extraordinary leader-ship and service. On a personal note, I have known Jean and her husband, Frank, for decades. I would like to thank them for their friendship and support of my work in Congress. I wish them contin-ued success in all that God has planned for their family.

OF INDIANA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, November 6, 2018 Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, it is with great respect and admiration that I take this time to recognize Colonel Robert A. Clifford, a fellow Gary, Indiana native, who has been se-lected for induction into the Indiana Military Veterans Hall of Fame, Class of 2018.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD —Extensions of RemarksE1496 November 6, 2018 
2018, at the National Guard Armory in Indian-apolis. Robert Clifford was born and raised in Gary, Indiana. His military training began at Pennsyl-vania Military College. With each passing year, the Colonel proved himself to be a lead-er among his peers, which resulted in him being commissioned a Second Lieutenant in the United States Army. Colonel Clifford’s ca-reer was both outstanding and extensive, and throughout his time in the service, he was rec-ognized by his commanding officers. In 1967, Robert was ordered to Vietnam as Infantry Platoon Leader, 1st Brigade of the 101st Air-borne Division. During his time in Vietnam, he spent 324 consecutive days in combat oper-ations. For his service, he was awarded the Silver Star, two Bronze Stars, and the Combat Infantryman’s Badge. The Colonel worked in the Indiana National Guard armory as a traditional weekend soldier before he returned to active status to work with the Indiana National Guard. Entrusted with many responsibilities, he served in many capacities including Commander, 13th Engi-neer Battalion; Commander, 138th Signal Bat-talion; Commander of the State Maintenance Program; and 38th Infantry Division General Staff (G3) Training and Operations Officer, a role in which he was responsible for approxi-mately 12,500 soldiers. During his career, Robert was assigned as the Indiana National Guard Engineer and Environmental Officer, overseeing all National Guard facilities for maintenance and repair. In addition, Colonel Clifford was able to help build five new armor-ies, two maintenance shops, the first ammuni-tion supply center, and numerous support fa-cilities. At one point in his career, he was one of three officers assigned by the Pentagon to start a military to military relationship with the newly created country of Slovakia. The suc-cessful partnership of these two groups is now in its 24th year. Colonel Clifford also served as the State of Indiana Public Health and Pre-paredness Director and was tasked with cre-ating a comprehensive plan, involving all nec-essary state organizations, to provide an im-mediate response to weapons of mass de-struction. This plan was not only implemented; it was made an example of by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a strategy that states should incorporate. Throughout the years, Colonel Clifford was bestowed numerous awards for his service. He has received the prestigious Legion of Merit Award for his truly exceptional efforts and devotion to the Indiana National Guard. He was awarded the prestigious Sagamore of the Wabash and was named ‘‘A Hoosier Hero.’’ In addition, the Colonel was designated a Distinguished Member of the Second Bat-talion of the 502nd Infantry Regiment of the 101st Airborne Division. He was among the first five ever to receive this honor from his Battalion. Robert Clifford’s commitment to his career is exceeded only by his devotion to his amazing family. Robert and his wonderful wife, Karen, have been married for 48 years. They have two sons, Rob (Jill) and Scott (Heather), and four beloved grandchildren. Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring Robert Clifford for his lifetime of service to the United States military and to the State of Indi-ana. For his truly noteworthy career and his outstanding dedication to serving others, Colo-nel Robert Clifford is worthy of the honors be-stowed upon him, and we are grateful for all of his many contributions.

YWCA 160TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. MICHAEL R. TURNER 
OF OHIO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, November 6, 2018 Mr. TURNER. Mr. Speaker, I want to con-gratulate the Young Women’s Christian Asso-ciation (YWCA) as it celebrates 160 years of service dedicated to supporting women, girls, and their families across the United States. Throughout its history, the YWCA has been at the forefront of the most critical social movements of the time, including civil rights, women’s empowerment, pay equity, health care reform, and gender-based violence pre-vention. The YWCA serves over two million women, girls, and their families each year, with 210 local associations across 46 states and the District of Columbia. The YWCA is the largest network of domestic violence and sexual as-sault service providers in the country, reaching over half a million women and girls annually. In my hometown of Dayton, Ohio, the YWCA has been a champion in the commu-nity since 1870 on behalf of women and fami-lies seeking to escape homelessness and do-mestic violence. The Dayton YWCA’s mission of empowering women and eliminating racism is displayed through the programs and services it provides, including the only emergency shelter service programs for women and families who are vic-tims of domestic violence in Montgomery and Preble Counties; a confidential 24-hour crisis hotline; and a mentoring program for teen girls, which inspires them to explore and achieve their highest potential. In 1893, the Dayton YWCA became the first YWCA in the United States with an officially organized program for African-American women and girls. As mayor of the city of Dayton, and as a Member of Congress, I have been proud to recognize the important contributions made by the Miami Valley’s most influential women, who have made a difference in our community through their dedication to the YWCA’s mis-sion of ‘‘empowering women, eliminating rac-ism and promoting peace, justice, freedom and dignity for all.’’ Each year the YWCA Women of Achieve-ment Award is presented to a select group of distinguished Dayton-area women, at a cere-mony that coincides with our annual observ-ance of Women’s History Month. It has been my privilege to congratulate a number of these recipients, who embody the YWCA’s 160-year mission to eliminate racism and empower other women. Mr. Speaker, as the YWCA celebrates its 160th anniversary, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating this outstanding organiza-tion, which has worked so hard to improve the lives of women and girls in my community, and across our nation. HONORING TOM CHALFANT HON. LUKE MESSER 
OF INDIANA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, November 6, 2018 Mr. MESSER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today, on behalf of the entire 6th Congressional District of Indiana, to recognize Tom Chalfant for his contribution to our state and Randolph County. Tom is a farmer in Randolph County and also serves as a County Commissioner. He has been involved in Republican politics for decades and is extremely well respected by the community. He is also a member of the 6th District Agriculture Advisory Committee, where he meets with my team regularly to dis-cuss emerging agriculture issues that are im-pacting Indiana farmers. Randolph County and our state are better off today because of his leadership and service. On a personal note, Tom is a friend in faith and was among my earliest and most vocal supporters. I want to thank him for his prayers and support of my work in Congress. I wish him continued success in all that God has planned for his family.

CELEBRATING THE 50TH ANNIVER-SARY OF ST. VOLODYMYR & OLHA UKRAINIAN CATHOLIC PARISH 
HON. MIKE QUIGLEY 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, November 6, 2018 Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 50th Anniversary of St. Volodymyr & Olha Ukrainian Catholic Parish. Their Jubilee celebration is being held at the Ukrainian Cultural Center—the center of the unification of the entire Ukrainian community and officiated by Patriarch Sviatoslav (Shevchuk) of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church with the participation of Bishop Bene-dict (Aleksiychuk), Fifth Eparch of St. Nicholas Ukrainian Catholic Eparchy based in Chicago. It will also include clergy members from Ukraine, Canada and the United States, the Consul General of Ukraine in Chicago, various dignitaries, and representatives of many im-portant organizations and institutions. Founded in 1968 by Patriarch Josyf Slipyj, Confessor for the Faith, and the Bishop of the Eparchy of Chicago, Yaroslav Gabro, Sts. Volodymyr & Olha Ukrainian Catholic Parish has an inspiring history. During its first five years, the parishioners of the newly estab-lished parish collected enough funds to build their own church while attending religious services at a neighboring Ukrainian Church— St. Volodymyr Orthodox Cathedral, which gra-ciously allowed the use of its church. In 1973, the newly erected church, employ-ing the Byzantine Ukrainian style of the 11th thru 13th century Ukraine, was blessed by Pa-triarch Josyf Slipyj, who only ten years earlier had been released from Siberian imprison-ment through the intervention of Pope John XXIII and President John F. Kennedy. A me-morial statue of Patriarch Slipyj stands at the church’s first location. Mr. Speaker, today and during the entire month of November 2018, we honor the mem-ory and sacrifices of all those who helped es-tablish Sts. Volodymyr & Olha Parish, just as

HONORING MAYOR MIKE PAVEY

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, November 6, 2018 Mr. MESSER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today, on behalf of the entire 6th Congressional District of Indiana, to recognize Mayor Mike Pavey for his contribution to our state and the City of Rushville. Throughout his career, Mike has served Rush County and the City of Rushville with honor and integrity. From his time on the city council to his service as mayor, Mike has made improving the quality of life in the com-munity his main priority. Several economic de-velopment initiatives, including being des-ignated as a Stellar Community in 2016, have helped improve the City of Rushville. Without a doubt, our state is better off today because of his extraordinary leadership and service.

HONORING THE SERVICE OF CAPT. JANICE CHRISTENSEN 
HON. BRADLEY SCOTT SCHNEIDER 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, November 6, 2018 Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ms. Janice Charlotte Christensen, a World War II veteran of the Women’s Airforce Service Pilots (WASP), and a former resident of Waukegan, IL. Founded in 1943, WASP was a wartime ci-vilian women pilots organization, which grad-uated only 1,074 women to operate military aircraft and fly non-combat missions. Members flew more than 60 million miles throughout the course of the Second World War serving over 120 bases around the country, including mis-sions towing aerial targets for anti-aircraft gun practice, simulating strafing missions, test fly-ing and ferrying aircrafts, serving as instruc-tors and transporting cargo. Thirty-eight WASPs lost their lives in the line of duty be-fore the program was disbanded in 1944. In the spring of 1942, at her own expense, Ms. Christensen began flying lessons at the Waukegan Airport and became an original member of the Waukegan Civil Air Patrol. After achieving the required 90 hours of flying time, she joined the WASP and left for training at Avenger Army Air Field in Sweetwater, Texas. On September 11, 1943, she grad-uated and would be stationed at Romulus Army Air Field in Michigan. A year later, she returned to Avenger Field and completed an intensive advanced course in instrument flying. Following that, she was stationed at Cochran Army Air Field in Macon, Georgia, until the WASP program was disbanded in December 1944. Despite her service, Ms. Christensen and other WASPs were denied veteran status. After returning home, Ms. Christensen was in-volved with the Waukegan Civil Air Patrol and joined the Air Force Reserve. Captain Christensen was honorably discharged from all appointments in the United States Air Force Reserves in November 1963. Her services were of great value to the Army Air Forces during the war, and as a vol-unteer she helped establish the capacity of women as non-combat military pilots. Finally, in 1977, WASPs would be granted veteran status by President Jimmy Carter to recognize their service. And in 2009, President Obama and Congress would award the Congressional Gold Medal to WASPs while only 300 vet-erans remained alive. Sadly, Ms. Christensen passed away in a car accident in 1965, never having seen her military contributions suffi-ciently honored. It is a privilege to properly recognize Cap-tain Janice Christensen on behalf of a grateful nation for her service to our country during World War II. I look forward to presenting her surviving family with a World War II Victory medal and a WASP medallion from the De-partment of Veterans Affairs to mark her gravestone on November 9, 2018. f 
HONORING DOMINIC GROTE 
HON. LUKE MESSER 
OF INDIANA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, November 6, 2018 Mr. MESSER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today, on behalf of the entire 6th Congressional District of Indiana, to recognize Dominic Grote for his contribution to our state and the City of Madi-son. As a member of the 6th District Manufac-turing Advisory Committee, Dominic regularly met with my team to discuss emerging manu-facturing issues that are impacting Indiana. Dominic is an important business leader in the Madison community and Indiana is better off today because of his extraordinary leadership and service. On a personal note, Dominic is a loyal friend and wise adviser. I want to thank the Grote family for their friendship and incredible support of my work in Congress. I wish them continued success in all that God has planned for their family.

HONORING THE CAREER OF RIGOBERTA MENCHU TUM 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, November 6, 2018 Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the career and achievements of Rigoberta Menchu Tum, who will be awarded with the Spendlove Prize by UC Merced. This prize honors an individual whose work exem-plifies the delivery of social justice diplomacy and tolerance in the diverse local and global city. Therefore, it is both fitting and appropriate that we honor the achievements of Rigoberta Menchu Tum’s, for her constant fight for jus-tice and equality. Rigoberta was born in January 9, 1959 to a poor indigenous peasant family and was raised in the Quiche branch of the Mayan cul-ture in Guatemala. As a child, she helped her family with farm work in the highlands and along the coast by picking coffee. Rigoberta’s lifelong service to justice and equality began in her adolescence, where through the Catholic Church she became involved in social reform activities and became a prominent figure in the women’s right’s movement. Her reform work arose opposition in influen-tial circles, who accused Rigoberta’s family of partaking in guerilla activities. The accusation led to the imprisonment of her father. After the release of her father, he joined the Committee of the Peasant Union. Following in her father’s footsteps, Rigoberta became a member in 1979. Rigoberta’s long-lasting fight began when her immediate family was brutally murdered by opposition groups. Rigoberta than became in-creasingly active in the Committee of the Peasant Union. In 1980, she became a promi-nent figure in a strike organized by the Com-mittee of the Peasant Union that aimed for better working conditions for farm workers on the Pacific Coast. Her involvement in dem-onstrations led her to join the radical 31st of January Popular Front, which strove to edu-cate indigenous peasant populations in resist-ance to military oppression. Rigoberta has been the voice of indigenous rights and ethnocultural reconciliation, not only in Guate-mala but in the Western Hemisphere. Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Rigoberta Menchu Tum for receiving the Spendlove Prize. Her advocacy has earned her international awards, including a Nobel Peace Prize in 1992, Prince of Austria’s Award in 1998 and was named a UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador. I ask that you join me in wishing her continued success. f 
HONORING CARL CAMPBELL 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, November 6, 2018 Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Public Affairs Director Carl Campbell, on his retirement after twenty years of service for Kaiser-Permanente in the Marin-Sonoma Service area. Mr. Campbell was born in Melbourne, Flor-ida. He earned a Bachelor’s Degree in Speech Arts and Radio and Television from San Diego State University. In 1998, Mr. Campbell joined Kaiser-Permanente Santa Rosa. He worked in multiple capacities in Public Affairs until 2004, when he became the Public Affairs Director for the Marin-Sonoma Service Area Administrative Team.

HONORING MAYOR CHUCK FEWELL 
HON. LUKE MESSER 
OF INDIANA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, November 6, 2018 Mr. MESSER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today, on behalf of the entire 6th Congressional District of Indiana, to recognize Mayor Chuck Fewell for his contribution to our state and the City of Greenfield. Throughout his career, Chuck has dedicated himself to serving our country, our state, and the City of Greenfield with honor and integrity. As mayor, Chuck has made improving the quality of life in Greenfield his main priority. Greenfield is better off today because of his extraordinary leadership and service. On a personal note, Chuck is a loyal friend and wise adviser. Chuck is among my closest friends in politics. I want to thank him for his incredible support of my work in Congress. I wish Chuck continued success in all that God has planned for him and his family.

RECOGNIZING COMITIS CRISIS CENTER 
HON. MIKE COFFMAN 
OF COLORADO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, November 6, 2018 Mr. COFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, in honor of National Homelessness and Hunger Aware-ness Week, I rise today to recognize the Comitis Crisis Center. Since 1970, Comitis has faithfully served over 100,000 individuals, including veterans and their families. Comitis has assisted them with transitional housing, emergency shelter, and taught them the skills they need to become self-sufficient. These services have resulted in permanent and safe housing for many of our fellow Americans. Comitis Crisis Center’s accomplishments in 2017 include serving over 4,000 individuals. The scale of the work Comitis performs is truly impressive. It prepared 138,000 meals, as-sembled 11,000 hygiene kits, and provided 50,000 overnight beds. Not only does this cen-ter give aide to the homeless, it also provides a 24/7 emergency shelter, as well as a variety of programs supporting individuals recovering from addiction, trauma, and mental health issues. This past year, I introduced H.R. 4099, the ‘‘Homeless Veteran Families Act.’’ H.R. 4099 is a bill targeted at combating homelessness for veterans, and their dependent minors and the inspiration for this bill was the great work for homeless veterans with dependent minors that the Comitis Crisis Center does. H.R. 4099 aims to assist community agencies, like the Comitis Crisis Center, expand and better cope with the problems faced by homeless veterans with minor dependents, as well as ensuring them safe shelter during their times of hard-ship. Mr. Speaker, during National Homelessness and Hunger Awareness Week, it is my pleas-ure to honor the Comitis Crisis Center, and its dedicated staff. The Comitis Crisis Center en-sures that everyone who walks through its doors is provided with sufficient resources, dignity, and the respect they deserve. I am confident the Comitis Crisis Center will con-tinue as a force for good in our community, as it has done for the past 48 years. f 
HONORING IOANNIS GIANNOPOULOS 
HON. GUS M. BILIRAKIS 
OF FLORIDA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, November 6, 2018 Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the important mark that Ioannis Giannopoulos had on American society, as the original founder of one of the oldest known wooden school house in the country. In order to fully understand the cultural motivation to establish this historic treasure, one must ex-amine Giannopoulos’s early life. A carpenter by trade, Ioannis Giannopoulos was the son of George and Maria-Canelas and hailed from the Petalidi area in Messinia that was then known as ‘‘Koroni’’ (the village of Skoutari, Mani). He was known by the Spanish as Juan Genopoly. Giannopoulos—at the age of 13— was one of a group of indentured laborers brought to the New World by Andrew Tumbull to work an indigo plantation at New Smyrna. This group of 1,403 Minorcans, Greeks and Italians suffered mistreatment, starvation and overextended servitudes at Turnbull’s planta-tion. The people were reduced to slavery, and treated with great cruelty by Trumbull, whose partner in the enterprise was the English Gov-ernor of the territory, who kept the colonists in subjection with English troops. This slavery lasted nine years, during which time nearly two-thirds of these colonists perished; but large crops of indigo were raised for the com-pany—one year 30,000 lbs. it is stated. In 1776, a new Governor having arrived, the petitions of these people for relief were lis-tened to, and they were released from the tyr-anny of their master. One year later six hun-dred refugees, led by Ioannis Giannopoulos, Francisco Pellicer and Antonio Llambias, walked to St Augustine and were granted asy-lum by Governor Tonyn. They became the largest group of immigrants to settle in Amer-ica in one group at one time. Collectively called ‘‘Minorcans’’, they were an important part of the fabric of St Augustine history. It was on Saint George Street where the sur-vivors of the New Smyrna Colony first settled after their escape. Since that time, this area of Old St Augustine has been called ‘‘the Greek Quarter’’ and alternately ‘‘the Minorcan Quar-ter.’’ Ioannis Giannopoulos built a little house out of red cedar and cypress and put it together with wooden pegs and handmade nails, some-time around 1800. This building was a home first but, as early as 1811, members of the Genopoly family taught the children of other Minorcan families in the first floor ‘‘school-room’’ of this building. As the story goes, Genopoly, in typical Greek fashion, was wor-ried his children would grow up without an education. Genopoly and his daughter Maria Manuela Barbara ‘‘Mary’’ Genopoly Darling were the first teachers. Then Genopoly hired a school teacher, and generations of children from St. Augustine went to school in this build-ing. Juan Genopoly died in 1820. Today, this preserved building is recognized as one of the oldest schoolhouses in North America. It has become the symbol of their hard work and perseverance. It’s now the main attraction of the historical precinct in St. George Street, Saint Augustine, Florida. John Giannopoulos left a deep imprint in the edu-cational history of St. Augustine by estab-lishing a school in his house. Now restored, it stands as one of the oldest school buildings in the United States. f 
HONORING MARK WYNN 
HON. LUKE MESSER 
OF INDIANA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, November 6, 2018 Mr. MESSER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today, on behalf of the entire 6th Congressional District of Indiana, to recognize Mark Wynn for his contribution to our state and our District. Mark is an attorney in Madison and served as the 6th District Chairman for most of my time in Congress. Mark is a straight shooter and was always someone I could count on for candid and honest advice. We traveled the state together to support and advance Repub-lican principles. He has served our party and state with honor and distinction. On a personal note, Mark was among my earliest and most vocal supporters. He is a loyal confidant and wise adviser. Quite simply, I could not have done this job without him. I want to thank him for his friendship and sup-port of my work in Congress. I wish Mark con-tinued success in all that God has planned for him and his family.

youth across the country in their mission to engage youth to reach their fullest potential and continues to enrich the live our youth throughout Merced County. The program’s goal to develop citizenship, leadership, responsibility, and life skills is ac-complished through hands on projects in agri-culture, science, health, and civic engage-ment. In doing so, youth develop relationships with their advisors, who mentor them into and provide support to help them achieve their full potential. This enables 4–H’ers to develop into true leaders, entrepreneurs and visionaries ready to lead the next generation of our coun-try. In my own district, the first 4–H office opened in 1917. Since then, Merced County 4–H has helped thousands of youth through-out the different communities that comprise Merced County to become confident, inde-pendent leaders. All the while, each different 4–H club throughout the county has been guided by their mission to provide experiences where young people learn by doing hands-on projects and at the same time, created more opportunities for youth to be engaged in their community. The program, delivered by Cooperative Ex-tension—a community of more than 100 public universities across the nation, is led in Cali-fornia by the University of California Coopera-tive Extension, the research and outreach arm of the UC’s Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources. This gives Merced County 4–H the unique opportunity to partner with UC Merced, the newest research university of the 21st century. Through this partnership, youth and advisors are connected to the scientific re-search of the UC happening in the San Joa-quin Valley, to help better understand and solve problems in agriculture throughout Cali-fornia. Honoring the organization showcases the in-credible ways that 4–H inspires kids to do more and highlights the remarkable 4–H youth in Merced County, who work each day to make a positive impact on those around them. The 4–H National Network consists of nearly 500,000 volunteers and 3,500 professionals that provide caring and supportive mentoring to all 4–H’ers, helping them to grow into true leaders, entrepreneurs and visionaries. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Merced County 4–H. It is both fit-ting and appropriate that we honor them and recognize the significant impact they have made and continue to make by empowering youth with the skills they needed for a lifetime.

RECOGNIZING PENNSYLVANIA STATE SENATOR STEWART GREENLEAF 
HON. BRIAN K. FITZPATRICK 
OF PENNSYLVANIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, November 6, 2018 Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a dedicated public servant, Penn-sylvania State Senator Stewart J. Greenleaf. Senator Greenleaf devotedly served the peo-ple of Bucks and Montgomery Counties in the Pennsylvania General Assembly for 42 years. A lifelong resident of Upper Moreland Town-ship, Senator Greenleaf graduated from the University of Pennsylvania, where he played varsity basketball, and received his law degree from the University of Toledo School of Law. He is married to Cecelia ‘‘Kelly’’ Greenleaf Early in his career, Senator Greenleaf served as Assistant District Attorney in Montgomery County and Chief of Appeals, writing briefs for cases that were appealed all the way to the United States Supreme Court. Stewart Green-leaf’s career in the Montgomery County Court-house was his first exposure to politics, which inspired his decision to make a life-long career of public service. Working as a prosecutor, he gained the insight into the criminal justice sys-tem and the judiciary that led to his decades- long chairmanship of the Pennsylvania Senate Judiciary Committee. Senator Greenleaf has passed more legislation than any other mem-ber of Pennsylvania’s 253-member General Assembly. He has been the prime sponsor of 160 bills signed into law, and the driving force of many other measures that didn’t carry his name. Notably, he has authored the Clean In-door Air Act of 2008, Pennsylvania’s Megan’s Law, the Grandparent Custody Law, the Rails to Trails Act, the School Pesticide Law, the Health Club Consumer Protection Act, the Puppy Lemon Law, the ‘‘No Means No’’ Law, the Amusement Ride Inspection Act, and the Missing Children Act. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Senator Greenleaf for truly dedicating his life to the service and betterment of others.

GUN VIOLENCE 
HON. ROBIN L. KELLY 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, November 6, 2018 Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today because this weekend 11 Americans were shot and killed while at a bris at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, PA. This synagogue is a staple of the Squirrel Hill community and a place used by Jewish Americans and their neighbors to celebrate life moments, community achievements and their faith in God. Sadly, one man, with a hate-filled heart and an AR–15, turned this peaceful, loving com-munity into victims of one of America’s worst and most shocking mass shootings. These are the names of the Americans that this Republican-controlled House failed with our failure to pass commonsense, broadly- supported bans of military-style assault weap-ons, like the AR–15: Jerry Rabinowitz, Cecil Rosenthal, David Rosenthal, Rose Mallinger, Bernice Simon, Sylvan Simon, Daniel Stein, Joyce Fienberg, Dr. Richard Gottfried, DMD, Irving Younger, and Melvin Wax. In addition to the 11 fatalities within the syn-agogue, four Pittsburgh police officers were shot and wounded, two remain in critical con-dition. Sadly, this hate crime was not the only hate-related shooting in America in recent days. Another man, with a hate-filled heart and a gun, shot and killed two Americans at a gro-cery store in Jeffersontown, KY. In Jeffersontown, we lost fellow Americans: Maurice E. Stallard and Vickie Lee Jones, to senseless gun violence. Mr. Stallard was at the store with his 12-year old grandson to buy poster board for a school project. Tragically, he witnessed the entire event. Mr. Speaker, by this Congress’ negligence and inaction, we have created a situation where grandparents and grandkids aren’t even safe going to the store for school supplies. Where will the madness end? Before entering the Kroger and beginning his rampage, the shooter had attempted to enter a predominately African American church—we sadly could have seen another Mother Emanuel had he been successful in entering that church. So, once again, Mr. Speaker, I ask you: ‘‘where does it end?’’ Our houses of worship are no longer safe. In fact, in the last three years, our nation has experienced not one, not two but three mass shootings in houses of worship around the country. Nine were killed at Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina. Twenty-six were killed at First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas. Now, eleven were killed at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Where will it end, Mr. Speaker? How many more praying people need to be gunned down before you will have the courage to act and save lives? Even the Speaker’s own Congressional Dis-trict—Wisconsin’s first—experienced as mass shooting at a Sikh Temple of Wisconsin in Oak Creek, which killed six. Yet, still he did not act to save lives, even though his own constituents were gunned down for the loving and worshipping their God. At what point did Congress become so be-holden to the NRA that we can’t find the polit-ical courage to save the lives of Americans exercising their First Amendment right to wor-ship as they please? It’s past time for the madness to stop. It’s past time for Congress to act. It’s past time to stop arming hate while only offering half-hearted ‘‘thoughts and prayers’’ while places of faith become places of death by gun violence. Mr. Speaker, will you act? Will you call Con-gress back into session and pass just one gun violence prevention bill?

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, November 6, 2018 Mr. MESSER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today, on behalf of the entire 6th Congressional District of Indiana, to recognize Lee and Rose McNeely for their contribution to our state and Shelby County.

SUPPORTING FAIR PRIVATIZATION OF TITANIUM MINES IN UKRAINE 
HON. KEN BUCK 
OF COLORADO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, November 6, 2018 Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with serious concerns about our national security. My home state of Colorado has a strong mili-tary tradition and military installations as well as a rich reserve of natural resources. I under-stand the importance of a well-equipped, well- supplied military force. That’s why I’m concerned about the current state of titanium mines in Ukraine. This may not seem like a major issue until you realize how dependent American commercial and de-fense aerospace is on foreign titanium. We im-port 79 percent of our consumed titanium each year. And much of this titanium comes from Russia. In fact, key U.S. defense suppliers, like Boe-ing, GE, and Pratt and Whitney, rely heavily on Russian titanium. This reliance on Russian titanium for key defense capabilities is deeply problematic in our present geopolitical environment. As the United States has justifiably sanctioned Russia for their interference in our election process and their belligerent activities in Ukraine and the United Kingdom, the Russian government has discussed retaliatory sanctions that could impact titanium exports to the United States. In view of this precarious Russian relation-ship, we need to immediately identify alter-native sources of titanium. China produces a lot of the metal, but they consume most of what they produce. And our national titanium stockpile was sold off over a decade ago. A key source of potential titanium comes from mines in Ukraine. Ukraine has pursued a free-market economic reform effort that in-cludes privatizing state-owned companies. Unfortunately, in the midst of this reform ef-fort, corruption, market distortion, and Russian influence has again reared its ugly head. Pow-erful oligarchs with ties to Russia and influ-ence in the Ukrainian government are des-perately trying to gain control of the titanium mines that are being privatized. One of Ukraine’s primary titanium mine as-sets is already under the pull of Russian influ-ence. The Zaporozhye Titanium and Magne-sium Combine is 49 percent owned by Dmytro Firtash, a Ukrainian billionaire with Russian ties who is under house arrest in Vienna and wanted by the U.S. for extradition due to his efforts to bribe Indian officials. We cannot allow Russia to gain influence and control over a key source of titanium in Ukraine. Allowing them to monopolize the market for titanium would lead to serious geo-political implications. Our ability to project power throughout the world, in a way that pro-motes global peace and stability, is dependent on military hardware that requires titanium for its construction. Beyond our national security interests are the interests of the Ukrainian people them-selves. We should support a fair and equitable process of privatization for Ukraine. A corrupt process would only undermine the rule of law and the country’s political system. Mr. Speaker, the United States and the international community must call on Ukraine to support a legitimate and fair process for the privatization and sale of titanium assets. We should push for an open and fair process that would allow global investors and U.S.-Ukrain-ian joint ventures to compete for these assets. Supporting a fair and open tender process will benefit not only the United States, but also the livelihood of the Ukrainian people as well as the security of the entire world.

OF INDIANA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, November 6, 2018 Mr. MESSER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the entire 6th Congressional District of Indiana, to recognize Rev. Matthew Barnes for his contribution to our state. For years, Matt has served as a pastor and spiritual leader at the Indiana Statehouse. Re-publicans and Democrats alike are blessed to have Matt around to pray with or turn to for guidance. I was fortunate to get to know Matt during my time in the Indiana General Assem-bly. Without a doubt, our state is better off today because of his extraordinary leadership and service. Most importantly, Matt is a brother in Christ, and I appreciate his prayers and encourage-ment over the years. I wish him continued success in all that God has planned for him and his family. No doubt, Matt is a man who will continue to serve the Lord. HONORING WANDA PAYNE FOR HER PUBLIC SERVICE HON. DONALD M. PAYNE, JR. 
OF NEW JERSEY  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, November 6, 2018 Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I ask my col-leagues to join me in honor of a dedicated public servant, my sister Wanda Payne, who recently retired from the Newark Public School System after thirty-two years of service. Wanda’s journey as a teacher began at the age of twelve, when she volunteered at New-ark’s Chen School. The following year she ob-tained a summer position at the school, and she worked there every year until her college graduation. Wanda attended Kean University, where she earned a degree in Early Childhood Education. She taught twenty-nine years at Camden Street School. Her first twenty-five years at Camden Street School were as a kindergarten teacher, then she taught pre-kindergarten for four years. Wanda transferred to Hawthorne Avenue School, where she taught kinder-garten and first grade before retiring. Wanda has made a difference in the lives of our most precious resources, our children. Wanda is dedicated to community service. She spent twenty-five years at the Fresh Air Fund, a program that sends hundreds of chil-dren to summer camp and assists seniors, single parents and the unemployed. She was a youth advisor for the North Jersey Youth Club, as well as the Youth in Government and Model U.N. programs for high school students. She is a consummate professional who has truly enjoyed her teaching career and her vol-unteer work. I am grateful that Wanda chose to follow in my father’s footsteps and become an educa-tor. She has served the children of the Newark Public School System with her heart, and in the process has created an outstanding leg-acy. Mr. Speaker, Ms. Wanda Payne deserves to be recognized for a job well done during her many years of dedicated service to the chil-dren of Newark. I am proud to have such a dedicated sister and wish her much success in her future endeavors. Wanda is the mother of one son and the grandmother of four.
