TRIBUTE TO REVEREND DR. W.B. LEWIS 
HON. DAVID E. PRICE 
OF NORTH CAROLINA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, August 8, 2017 Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the Reverend Dr. W.B. Lewis who is retiring after fifty-three years as the Pastor of First Cosmopolitan Baptist Church in Raleigh, North Carolina. I have come to appreciate over many years the gracious hospitality and faithful witness of Rev. Lewis and this congregation. Early in my term of service—but well into his—we worked together to help land a so-called ‘‘section 202’’ Housing and Urban Development grant to con-struct rental housing for the elderly under First Cosmopolitan’s sponsorship. Those apart-ments stand as a symbol of Rev. Lewis’s lead-ership and the church’s understanding of its ministry. Under Rev. Lewis’s leadership, First Cos-mopolitan has grown into a powerful pillar of the Raleigh community. Dr. Lewis himself has become an institution of sorts within North Carolina. For four years, he served as the President of the General Baptist State Con-vention. He was appointed by North Carolina Governor James Hunt to serve on the board for Smart Start. His service has also included the Raleigh Interdenominational Ministerial Al-liance, the Raleigh Interracial Ministerial Asso-ciation, the Raleigh YMCA Board of Directors, the State Board of Chaplaincy, the Rich Park Board of Directors, the Board of Trustees at Shaw University, Prince Hall Lodge, the Ma-sonic Order of Raleigh, Wake and Johnston Missionary Baptist Association, Wake Baptists Association Ministers, and the Deacons Union. Reverend Lewis has rightfully been recog-nized on numerous occasions for his roles as a pastor, builder, teacher, mentor, spiritual and community leader, and friend to many. In 2013, he was inducted into the Wake Baptist Association ‘‘Hall of Fame’’. In 2017, he was presented with the ‘‘Loving Cup’’, the highest award that can be presented to an individual minister or pastor who has served with distinc-tion, from the General Baptist State Conven-tion of North Carolina. During his tenure he was also instrumental in the planning and execution of two projects critical to the South East Raleigh Community: the Willie B. Lewis Family Center, and Rich Park, a 100 unit apartment complex that serves the elderly and handicapped. Reverend Lewis also co-authored ‘‘A Splendid Enter-prise,’’ a history of the General Baptist State Convention of North Carolina. Having an artis-tic eye, he was also instrumental in the design of the beautiful Martin Luther King Jr. Park in Raleigh. In celebration of his great accomplishments, Rev. Lewis will be the recipient of the order of the Long Leaf Pine, which is the highest honor bestowed upon a citizen by the Governor of the State of North Carolina. I am pleased to join the State of North Carolina and the Ra-leigh community in celebrating this remarkable man, whom I and many others regard as a mentor and friend. We thank Rev. Lewis for a legacy of lives touched and a community made more welcoming and just, and we wish him the very best in retirement.

HONORING MICHAEL JOSE ZELAYA 
HON. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM 
OF NEW MEXICO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, August 8, 2017 Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an exceptional young person from my district. Michael Jose Zelaya, a member of Boy Scout Troop 220 in Albuquerque, NM. Michael re-cently achieved the rank of Eagle Scout fol-lowing 12 years in scouting. Michael’s perse-verance and dedication in the Boy Scouting program has helped shape his desire to be a leader in his community. For his Eagle Scout Service Project, Mi-chael constructed several large barriers at the Albuquerque Bio Park. This was designed to deter aggressive gorilla behavior, enhancing both the experience for the patrons as well as the safety of the animals. Through scouting Michael has grown as an individual and as a member of his community. With Boy Scout Troop 220, Michael and many of his fellow boy scouts have volunteered countless hours of community service. Land-scape projects, food banks, trail preservation, awareness walks, tree and garden restoration, and several improvement projects at his church that kindly host the troop are just a small representation of Michael’s character and work ethic. Over the last 12 years in scouting, Michael has hiked hundreds of miles, learned life-saving first aid and CPR, has visited the Fed-eral Court and U.S. Marshall Facility, also learned auto mechanic basics, practiced gun safety, rifle shooting, and many more experi-ences; but most importantly, he has built friendships and grown in the love he has for his country. I am confident that Michael will continue to be a leader in our community and I look for-ward to hearing about his continued success. Congratulations, Michael. f

1955, where she attended public schools. Ms. Torres graduated from the City University of New York and Lincoln University. Among her many achievements, Ms. Torres was instrumental in working with local elected officials to push the New York City Housing Authority to fully repair old, faulty gas pipes at Smith Houses that sometimes forced residents to go without cooking gas for weeks or months at a time. Under this leadership and partner-ship, Smith residents can reliably use their ovens and stoves without having to worry about looming gas outages. Ms. Torres’ leadership has also been put to the test by multiple natural disasters. Her ef-forts resulted in the successful evacuation of hundreds of Smith residents ahead of Hurri-cane Irene, and her advocacy during Hurri-cane Sandy demonstrated that an organized community can overcome the worst of disas-ters. On behalf of the residents of Alfred E. Smith Houses, she recently formed a Sandy Task Force for the purpose of overseeing the Sandy Recovery and Resiliency at Smith. After decades of community work, serving on advisory councils and public school parent associations, Ms. Torres retired in 2014 from the Department of Education as the Lower East Side’s Family Advocate. In August 2004, she, along with Principal Santiago Tavares, in-stituted a Citywide High School Summer Grad-uation. In 2010, Torres also began serving as President of the Alfred E. Smith Resident As-sociation, on Manhattan’s Lower East Side. Ms. Torres married the late George Carmona, Jr. in 1971, and had two children, George III and Liza Noemi. For more than 50 years, she has resided on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, where she lives with her daughter and grandchildren, Mia and Elijah.

HON. JIM BANKS 
OF INDIANA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, August 8, 2017 Mr. BANKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize Design Collaborative, an ar-chitecture and engineering firm in Fort Wayne, Indiana. This year marks their 25th anniver-sary. Since 1992, Design Collaborative, and its team of architects, engineers, interior design-ers, and graphic designers has created projects in northeast Indiana, with work fo-cused on higher education, healthcare, and workplace design. Over the last few years, it has developed a strong portfolio in the design of spaces for financial, recreational, multi-fam-ily housing, and civic clients. The company was founded by two archi-tects and an engineer with dreams of improv-ing people’s worlds through the design of peo-ple-first places. Today, Design Collaborative employs over 60 people and is a model busi-ness for developing a culture and environment that attracts and retains talent to the region. They are also consistently and actively in-volved in the development of downtown Fort Wayne and northeast Indiana. Their work has helped make the Fort Wayne region a destina-tion to live, work, and play. Over 25 years, Design Collaborative has de-signed thousands of projects in Fort Wayne and beyond, impacting clients in Indiana, Col-orado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsyl-vania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. Design Collaborative has earned multiple honors, including the 2011 American Institute of Architects Indiana Chapter Distinguished Firm of the Year, 2015 Indiana Office of Small Business Entrepreneurship Companies to Watch, 2017 Professional Services Manage-ment Journal Circle of Excellence, 7-time Best Places to Work in Indiana, and multiple local and national design awards from organizations like the American Institute of Architects, Amer-ican School and University Magazine, and Illu-mination Engineering Society. Since its beginning, Design Collaborative has always believed that the true measure of a project’s success is the positive impact it has on the lives of the people who use it. De-sign Collaborative truly believes in people-first places. Its goal is to make life better for the people who live, work, learn, heal, or worship inside the spaces they design. Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate the entire team at Design Collaborative on 25 years of improving people’s worlds through design, and wish them another 25 years and more.

HONORING CAPTAIN JEFF PAGANINI 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, August 8, 2017 Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Captain Jeff Paganini upon his retirement after over forty years of firefighting in the Sonoma Valley. He has been serving as Captain at Sonoma Valley Fire and Rescue since 1997. Captain Paganini began his fire service as a work experience student at Sonoma Fire De-partment in 1975. Two years later, at the age of eighteen, he became a regular volunteer firefighter and spent his summer working the fire season with the California Division of For-estry. In 1978, he served as a reserve fire-fighter for the Napa Fire Department before joining Sonoma Valley Fire and Rescue as a paid Engineer. The department promoted Cap-tain Paganini to Lieutenant in 1990 and Cap-tain in 1997. In 1980, the Department recognized then Engineer Paganini as the Sonoma County Firefighter of the Year for his quick thinking during a house fire call.

saved her life. Captain Paganini touched many lives during his years of fighting fires, serving the public and mentoring other firefighters. Many buildings and programs stand as a testament Captain Paganini’s excellent career. He secured funding and helped design the museum at the Albert C. Mazza Fire Station in Sonoma. The museum shares the rich history of firefighting the Sonoma Valley and displays several original objects and photos. He played a major role in the design of a state of the art training tower that is still in use. In 2006, Cap-tain Paganini started the ‘‘Every 15 Minutes’’ program at Sonoma Valley High School. This program demonstrates the fatal outcomes re-lated to driving drunk or impaired. He used his experience and insight to set the specifications for the new ladder truck to service our com-munities. Captain Paganini was instrumental in the formation and ultimate success of the Sonoma Valley Fire and Rescue Authority, which start-ed as a Joint Powers Authority between City of Sonoma Fire and Valley of the Moon Fire District. Through skillful negotiating and com-promising, he paved the way to establishing the great organization that our community en-joys today. Mr. Speaker, Captain Jeff Paganini has led a long career serving the people of our com-munity. Therefore, it is fitting and proper that we honor him here today and extend our best wishes for an enjoyable retirement.

HONORING THE LIFE OF MS. NELLIE CROWSTON 
HON. ELIZABETH H. ESTY 
OF CONNECTICUT  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, August 8, 2017 Ms. ESTY of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Ms. Nellie Crowston and her tireless work on behalf of students, teachers, and our entire community in Torrington, Connecticut. Nellie passed away on July 30, 2017, at the age of 79, but her contributions and legacy will live on in Torrington for many years to come. Many in Torrington know Nellie for her dec-ades of work as a public school teacher. She represented the best of what it means to be an educator. Nellie’s students remember her for her caring and encouraging nature. Nellie also possessed an astounding memory and regularly recognized her students around town years after they had left her classroom. Even after retiring, Nellie loved to return to the classroom as a substitute teacher and work with children. She was an inspiration to both her students and her fellow teachers. Outside of her teaching career, Nellie was an active member of our community and con-tributed to a number of causes close to her heart. Her work was crucial in saving and ex-panding the Torrington Alpha Delta Kappa chapter, a society for women educators. She boosted the group’s membership and orga-nized fundraisers and events that expanded its presence in our city. Her work allowed Alpha Delta Kappa to provide grants to local teach-ers and scholarships to high school students. Nellie was also engaged in local and state politics and served on the Torrington Demo-cratic Town Committee. She was instrumental in recruiting local candidates to run for office, organizing the Picnic Committee, and sup-porting voter outreach. What’s more, Nellie possessed an extensive knowledge of the issues facing Connecticut and her local com-munity. Her enthusiasm for service inspired many of her fellow educators to become politi-cally engaged and work to improve Connecti-cut’s schools. Nellie’s dedication to service should be a model for public servants every-where. Mr. Speaker, Nellie Crowston was a dedi-cated teacher and community leader who in-spired countless students and made Torrington a better place to live. It is fitting and proper that we honor her legacy here today. All those who knew her will cherish her mem-ory. CONGRATULATING KATE RUE-DIGER OF THE NEW HAVEN SHAMROCKS HON. BLAINE LUETKEMEYER

HONORING DANIEL SCHOELLKOPF 
HON. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM 
OF NEW MEXICO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, August 8, 2017 Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an exceptional young person from my district. Daniel Schoellkopf is an Albuquerque High School graduate who recently achieved the rank of Eagle Scout following 11 years in scouting. Daniel’s dedication to his goal of reaching the highest rank in the Boy Scouting program helped shape his desire to be a lead-er in his community. As part of his Eagle project, Daniel worked with the Drug Enforcement Agency on a pro-gram to encourage people to turn in unused prescription drugs at convenience centers. This effort is particularly important in New Mexico as we work to discourage the abuse of opioids, especially among young people. During his senior year in high school, Daniel worked at Kirtland Air Force Base as a life-guard, where he was awarded the Bright Star civilian award by the U.S. Air Force. He has also worked summers at Camp Gorham north of Santa Fe. Daniel earned a ROTC scholarship to the University of New Mexico, where he would like to study political science and eventually be-come an officer in the military. Daniel recently visited my office in Wash-ington, D.C. to raise awareness for Multiple Sclerosis (M.S.) with the M.S. Society advo-cacy group. The M.S. Society is a nonprofit or-ganization dedicated to helping people with M.S. by funding research, driving change through advocacy, facilitating professional education, and providing programs and serv-ices that help people with M.S. and their fami-lies. I am confident that Daniel will continue to be a leader in our community and I look forward to hearing about his continued success. Con-gratulations, Daniel.
