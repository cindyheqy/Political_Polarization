House of Representatives

f 
PRAYER The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: Loving God, we give You thanks for giving us another day. Lord, You know there are many Americans who look to the people’s House as uncertainty about the future of the economy and their livelihoods hang in the balance. Petty partisanship and ever-politicizing rhetoric should have no place at all when men and women of goodwill come together to serve the common good. We ask again that You bless the Members of the people’s House with the understanding that it is their work to develop the strategies and the plans to assuage the fears of their fellow coun-trymen and -women. We ask again that You impel those who possess power here in the Capitol to be mindful of those whom they rep-resent who possess little or no power and whose lives are made all the more difficult by a failure to work out seri-ous differences. May all that is done today be for Your greater honor and glory. Amen.

ADJOURNMENT FROM SATURDAY, DECEMBER 22, 2018, TO MONDAY, DECEMBER 24, 2018 The SPEAKER. Without objection, when the House adjourns—— Mr. M
CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker. The SPEAKER. For what purpose does the gentleman seek recognition? Mr. M
CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, re-serving the right to object—and I will not object—I had hoped to have been recognized earlier to offer a unanimous consent request to call up H.R. 7397, Democratic whip S
TENY HOYER ’s bill to end the Trump government shutdown and fund the government through Feb-ruary 8. I was told that I would be blocked from doing that. For the life of me, I don’t understand why President Trump and congres-sional Republicans have shut the gov-ernment down three days before Christ-mas. I think it is embarrassing and it is wrong. 800,000 Federal employees will not get paid during this holiday season because of the shutdown. The Senate passed a continuing reso-lution unanimously. We were set to do the same thing in the House, until the President had a temper tantrum. It is frustrating that Republicans won’t allow us to proceed to end this shutdown. I would hope that maybe the Speaker would be open to a unanimous consent request so I could bring this legislation up so we can fund the gov-ernment and end the shutdown. The SPEAKER. Does the gentleman withdraw his reservation? Mr. M
CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I withdraw my reservation of objection. The SPEAKER. Without objection, when the House adjourns today, it shall adjourn to meet at 10:30 a.m. on Monday, December 24, 2018. There was no objection.

GOVERNMENT FUNDING Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, I have on a red sweater this morning in the hopes that Christmas is not too far away for all of us, including the Mem-bers of Congress. With that in mind, let me give everyone an update on where we are. Yesterday, the Democratic leader and I reached a procedural agreement to create space for ongoing negotia-tions over government funding. To pro-vide flexibility as the White House and Senate Democrats continue their dis-cussions, the Senate already officially proceeded to the House-passed funding legislation—so that is pending—but we did so with an understanding that no further votes will occur until the Presi-dent and Senate Democrats have reached an agreement to resolve this. Let me say that again. We pushed the pause button until the President, from whom we will need a signature, and Senate Democrats, from whom we will need votes, reach an agreement—no procedural votes, no test votes, just a meaningful vote on a bipartisan agree-ment whenever that is reached, and it is my hope that it is reached sooner rather than later. It is no mystery why securing our Nation’s borders is such a major pri-ority for Republicans here in the Sen-ate and Republicans over in the House and for President Trump. Any look at the plain facts leads to one simple con-clusion: The crisis of security at our southern border is real. Over the past year, Customs and Bor-der Protection’s records of apprehen-sions and interdictions at our southern border are literally staggering—800 known gang members, a 50-percent in-crease over last year, nearly 7,000 indi-viduals with criminal histories, includ-ing weapons trafficking and violent of-fenses, more than double the levels of fentanyl, along with other illicit sub-stances. So the report card is quite clear. America’s borders are in crisis. These facts I have stated are not partisan facts. They aren’t ideological. They are just facts—just facts. They don’t de-scribe the Republican Party’s version of events or the President’s version of events. They describe reality. So one would think that securing our homeland, controlling our borders, and protecting the American people would be bipartisan priorities—uncontro-versial, commonsense, bipartisan prior-ities—a core duty of any nation’s gov-ernment. And here is the interesting thing. Until very, very recently, that seemed to be the case. Back in 2006, Democrats were perfectly happy to support hun-dreds—hundreds—of miles of physical barriers along the border. Twenty-six Democrats voted for the bill, including then-Senator Obama and then-Senator Clinton and my good friend the current Democratic leader from New York, but what about more recently? Earlier this very year—this year, Mr. President— the Democratic leader offered $25 bil-lion for physical barriers in his nego-tiations with the President, which is five times as much as the White House is reasonably requesting right now. That was just earlier this year. Republicans in the House and in the Senate believe the House’s provision for $5 billion in border funding plus ad-ditional disaster funding were com-pletely reasonable. I was glad to vote

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES8022 December 22, 2018 
to advance that legislation yesterday. My colleagues and I are proud to stand with the American people on this sub-ject for the safety of American families and the health and security of our com-munities, but this time—this time— Democrats have rejected that reason-able request. They have refused to meet President Trump half way and provide even one-fifth of the resources for the border they were willing to pro-vide just a few months ago. There is no bright line of principle that separates hundreds of miles of physical barriers in 2006 from new physical barriers in 2018. There is no major philosophical shift that made $25 billion for border security worthwhile just a few months ago but makes a far more modest investment of $5 billion immoral and unacceptable today. No, Democrats haven’t rejected the President’s request and invited this partial government shutdown because of some principled objections they just discovered in the last few weeks. It is not some principled discovery they just made in the last few weeks. They brought this about because they are under a lot of pressure—we all know this—from their far left and feel com-pelled to disagree with the President on almost anything and certainly this. So that is where we are, but we don’t need to be here for long. In order to get us out of this mess, a negotiated solu-tion will need to check these boxes. It is really very simple. It will need the support of 60 Senators, which will obvi-ously include a number of Democrats. It will need to pass the House. And it will need a Presidential signature. That is how we make a law in this situ-ation. Sixty 60 votes in the Senate, a majority of the House, and President Trump’s signature are what is needed. That is what will end this regrettable episode, reopen the lapsed portions of the Federal Government, and produce the investment in border security that our Nation really needs. So I am glad that productive discus-sions are continuing at this hour be-tween my friend the Democratic lead-er, the Democratic leader in the House, and the White House. When those nego-tiations produce a solution that is ac-ceptable to all of those parties, it will receive a vote here on the Senate floor.

CHILD PROTECTION IMPROVE-MENTS ACT OF 2017—Continued The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-pore. Under the previous order, the Senate will resume consideration of the House message to accompany H.R. 695, which the clerk will report. The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: 
House Message to accompany H.R. 695, a bill to amend the National Child Protection Act of 1993 to establish a voluntary national criminal history background check system and criminal history review program for cer-tain individuals who, related to their em-ployment, have access to children, the elder-ly, or individuals with disabilities, and for other purposes. Pending: 
McConnell motion to concur in the House amendment to the Senate amendment to the House amendment to the Senate amendment to the bill. 
Mr. M CCONNELL. I suggest the ab-sence of a quorum. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-pore. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER  
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-pore. The minority leader is recog-nized. Mr. SCHUMER. Merry Christmas, happy holidays to you, sir, and to the legislative staff. I ask unanimous consent that the quorum call be dispensed with. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-pore. Without objection, it is so or-dered. 
f 
GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, at midnight last night, roughly 25 percent of the government shut down because of one person and one person alone: President Trump. We arrived at this moment because President Trump has been on a destructive 2-week temper tantrum, demanding the American tax-payer pony up for an expensive and in-effective border wall that the President promised Mexico would pay for. Make no mistake. The Trump shut-down is not about border security. All of the proposals we have made contain over $1 billion in new border security money, the same amount allocated last year by both parties and even the President agreed to. The Trump admin-istration has barely even spent any of the border security money from last year. So the Trump shutdown isn’t over border security; it is because President Trump is demanding billions of dollars for an expensive, ineffective wall the majority of Americans don’t support. Let me remind you, the President called for a shutdown no less than 25 times. He has wanted one for months. In our meeting in the Oval Office, President Trump said he would be ‘‘proud’’ to shut the government down. Imagine saying he would be proud to shut the government down. Even Rush Limbaugh, one of the big-gest supporters of the President, said it was a Trump shutdown; that he caused it. He said—this is Limbaugh speaking: ‘‘The President wants you to know it’s money [for the wall] or nothing, and if it’s nothing, he shuts it down.’’ Just 2 days ago, the Senate unani-mously agreed to a proposal by Leader M
CCONNELL to keep the government open through February. It wasn’t ex-actly what Democrats wanted—we thought it should be longer—but we agreed because we wanted to keep the government open, and all indications were that the President would sign the bill, but President Trump—beholden to the far, far right, unwilling to shoulder even the slightest critique from Rush Limbaugh or Laura Ingraham— changed his mind on the bipartisan Senate bill, passed unanimously by all Republicans and all Democrats in this Chamber, and he sent his House allies off to tilt at windmills. Everyone knew yesterday, long be-fore the House vote, that the Presi-dent’s wall lacked 60 votes in the Sen-ate. It has proven to lack even 50 votes. It will never pass the Senate—not today, not next week, not next year. So President Trump, if you want to open the government, you must aban-don the wall, plain and simple. The Senate is not interested in swindling American taxpayers for an unneces-sary, ineffective, and wasteful policy. What we do support, Democrats and Republicans, is real, effective border security—but not a wall. The wall is President Trump’s bone to the hard- right people. It is no way to spend $5 billion, for a political bone. I have heard the President and his al-lies in the media say Democrats don’t support border security. Nothing could be further from the truth. Democrats have always been for smart and effective ways to secure our border. We are pushing for technology, like drones and sensors and inspection equipment. Every single proposal we made to the President included $1.3 bil-lion for border security. The Trump shutdown provides zero dollars for bor-der security, but I have never sup-ported a border wall, and I challenge anyone on the hard right to find a time that I—or any expert—has supported a wall like what the President has pro-posed. So where do we go from here? Well, three proposals are on the table, two by Democrats—Leader PELOSI and I— one by Leader M
CCONNELL , each of which would reopen the government and provide $1.3 billion in border secu-rity. We are also open to discussing any proposals with the President as long as they don’t include funding for the wall, but in order for an agreement to be reached, all four congressional leaders must sign off and the President must endorse it and say he will sign it. Leader M
CCONNELL must agree. Speak-er R
YANmust agree. They cannot duck responsibility. Leader M
CCONNELL still controls this Chamber. Speaker R
YAN controls what reaches the floor of the House. They are essential to this proc-ess. Leader M
CCONNELL can’t duck out of it. He knows that. Of course, Leader P
ELOSI and I must agree. Most impor-tantly, the President must publicly support and say he will sign an agree-ment before it gets a vote in either Chamber. We don’t want to go through what we went through a few days ago. Both Leader M
CCONNELL and I have agreed on that qualification for a spe-cific reason. Repeatedly, the President

has privately agreed to a deal with con-gressional leaders, only to reverse him-self when criticized by the far right. We can’t have another situation when the President signals support at first but then reverses himself, which is pre-cisely what caused this shutdown in the first place. If Leader M
CCONNELL , Speaker R YAN, Leader P
ELOSI , and I agree on a solu-tion, and the President says he will sign it, we can end the Trump shut-down immediately. Discussions continue among the members of our staffs. The Republican Leader and I will update the Senate on the status of those talks once progress has been made. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

By doing that, they denied vital serv-ices to millions of American citizens. Since midnight last night, just a few days before Christmas, more than 800,000 dedicated public servants and their families have been told not to ex-pect their next paycheck for the fore-seeable future. There is one reason and one reason only that our Federal Government has shut down today and countless Ameri-cans are living with uncertainty. That reason is President Donald J. Trump. The President is holding the Federal Government hostage for $5 billion of from the American taxpayer for his un-necessary, ineffective, and expensive wall on the southern border—a wall he repeatedly promised—gave his word to the American taxpayers—that Mexico would pay for. Now he wants American taxpayers to dig in their pockets and pay for it. The President’s irresponsible behav-ior is astounding. His job, like ours, is to keep the Federal Government oper-ating for the hundreds of millions of Americans who depend on government services every day, from our national parks, to housing services for the elder-ly, the disabled, our veterans, and for assistance for our Nation’s farmers. In fact, 2 days ago, the President signed the farm bill into law and praised his efforts. Today, he precipitated a shut-down that shuttered the doors to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s field offices—the same offices farmers rely on to understand this new law. But the worst part of all is that this was completely avoidable. We provided the President with several options to avoid this result. It is a case where he cannot take yes for an answer. We of-fered to pass six full-year appropria-tions bills and a continuing resolution for Homeland or a continuing resolu-tion for all the remaining bills. Either of these options would have kept the government open. They would have provided more than $1 billion for bor-der security—the very thing the Presi-dent says he needs and cares most about. Plus, signing them instead of having a needless shutdown would save taxpayers millions of dollars. After both of these offers were re-jected, the Senate passed by voice vote a 7-week continuing resolution. This would have given us more time to ne-gotiate and avert this catastrophe. Democrats and Republicans came to-gether to pass it. The President had agreed to sign it. We finally had a path forward. Then FOX News and the right-wing media started criticizing it. The President’s ego won out over his duties to the country. His ego was so bruised, he reversed course and went back on what he had agreed to. Here we are exactly where the Presi-dent wanted us to be—in the middle of a Trump shutdown. For anyone doubt-ing where responsibility lies, let’s re-call that the President has publicly called for a government shutdown no fewer than 25 times over the past year. Just last week, he declared he would be proud to shut down the government un-less we capitulated to his demand. Proud? I have been here with every President, Republican and Democratic, since President Gerald Ford. It is one of the most reckless statements I have ever heard uttered by a President of the United States. And now he has made good on his threat. His pride has won out, and the Trump shutdown has begun. How long is it going to last? Who knows? Yesterday, the President promised it would last a long time, and then he promised us it would be a short shutdown. Even in this, his behavior is erratic. How did we get here? Is there a le-gitimate crisis precipitating this shut-down? Is the President playing games with the lives and livelihoods of Amer-ican citizens to solve some immediate problem that threatens our Nation? No. Of course not. In caving to the most extreme sliver of his base, Presi-dent Trump is throwing what many of us have described as a childish tantrum because he wants money to fulfill a cynical promise he made repeatedly on the campaign trail—more of a symbolic prize than any sensible policy solution. This wasteful wall—a wall he prom-ised Mexico would pay for, not the American taxpayers—this wasteful wall that he now wants to bill to the American taxpayers would do more to preserve the President’s ego than it would to protect the American people. But I believe it is the natural result of the President’s years-long demoniza-tion and vilification of immigrants, years during which the President ral-lied his base with falsehoods and fan-tasies where vulnerable women and children are portrayed as hordes of gang members and terrorists invading our country. The sad reality, as Repub-licans and Democrats know, is that many of these people coming to our country are fleeing desperate situa-tions in their home countries, and they are looking for sanctuary. They are not coming here to perpetuate violence; they are running from it. Let me be clear. There is no crisis that requires us to build a 30-foot wall between us and our neighbors to the south. The President’s hateful rhetoric about a crisis on our southern border does not reflect reality. At the end of 2017, arrests of people attempting to enter the United States illegally dropped to historic lows. Be-tween 2000 and 2018, border apprehen-sions fell sharply from 1.6 million in fiscal year 2000 to approximately 400,000 in fiscal year 2018. That is a 75- percent drop. Not only do the facts on the ground not warrant spending bil-lions of American taxpayer dollars on a ‘‘big beautiful wall,’’ as the President likes to call it, that is not who we are as a nation. We are a country founded by immigrants, just as my maternal grandparents came to Vermont from Italy, my paternal great-great-grand-parents came to Vermont from Ireland, and my wife’s parents came to Vermont from the Province of Quebec in Canada. We need to look at the im-migrant founding of our country. Then, if we want to wall ourselves off from our neighbors, it will not only be an ex-pensive waste of Americans’ taxpayer dollars, but it will be immoral, ineffec-tive, and an affront to everything this country is supposed to stand for. To build a wall, the President wants to seize land from ranchers and farmers in Texas and in other border States— seize lands that have been in their fam-ilies for generations. He would need to construct walls through wildlife ref-uges and nature preserves, basically de-stroying them. Ironically, we would end up walling ourselves off from the Rio Grande in the process, essentially ceding the river to Mexico. After all of that and after billions of wasted taxpayer dollars, what would it accomplish? Would it stop people from fleeing violence in their home coun-tries and seeking sanctuary? No. Would it stop drug smugglers and human traf-fickers from engaging in illegal activ-ity? Definitely no. As so many have said, show me a 30-foot wall, and I will show you a 31-foot ladder or a tunnel. To address these complex issues, we need real solutions, not bumper sticker slogans, not angry tweets. Everyone agrees we need to keep our borders safe and secure, but it has to be with smart border security, with border security that works, with new technologies that have proven to have worked on the bor-der and at our ports of entry, tech-nologies with new air and marine as-sets and additional personnel who are needed. A 30-foot wall is symbolic and unneeded. Even if we needed to build it, what is the rush? Over the past 2 years, Congress has provided nearly $1.7 bil-lion to build or to replace fencing on

the southern border. Yet the adminis-tration has hardly spent any of that money, and the projects it has under-taken have been handled in such a way that they have ballooned in cost. We have given the administration $1.7 bil-lion, and it is now demanding more. How much of the $1.7 billion did it spend? It spent 6 percent. Six percent of these funds have been spent. We have recently learned that one project in the Rio Grande Valley that was sup-posed to cost $445 million will now cost American taxpayers nearly $787 mil-lion. That is a 77-percent cost overrun with a pricetag of $31.5 million for each and every mile. We have seen that you cannot trust the administration to be responsible with the money we have already pro-vided, let alone trust it to spend re-sponsibly the additional money the President is demanding. Once and for all, let’s put an end to this nonsense, and we have an easy way to do it. We could finish six of the seven ap-propriations bills right now while we continue to debate these other issues. These bills are the product of bipar-tisan compromise as the Republicans and Democrats have come together. They provide billions of dollars in new resources to address critical needs for the American people. They protect U.S. national security. These six bills that we have already agreed on—Repub-licans and Democrats—would provide much needed funding to help combat our Nation’s opioid epidemic and crit-ical investments in infrastructure. They would help us to rebuild our Na-tion’s crumbling roads, bridges, and highways. They would provide re-sources to protect the environment and help ensure that the water we drink and the air we breathe is safe and clean for this generation, for our children, and for the following generation. They would also support key allies and na-tional security programs to enable the United States to be a global leader—a role that is being increasingly chal-lenged by China and Russia. So I have to ask; is the President really going to hold the American peo-ple hostage over a wall that he, time and again, has promised Mexico will pay for? Is he really going to force hun-dreds of thousands of Federal employ-ees, including the very Agency he de-pends upon to carry out his immigra-tion enforcement policy, to work with-out pay over the Christmas holiday? Is he really going to tell millions of Americans, including his most ardent supporters, that he could care less whether they are cut off from critical government services purely in the serv-ice of his own vanity? The President has, apparently, de-cided that fighting a symbolic fight for a shiny object is more important than keeping our government running for the American people. It is the height of irresponsibility. As negotiations with Chairman S
HELBY and Leader M CCONNELL con-tinue in good faith, I am here this weekend to continue to talk with Mem-bers of both parties, but we are all coming to the same conclusion. We can agree easily, Republicans and Demo-crats, but we can only succeed if the President decides to do what we have done, which is to put the country first. The President of the United States owes that to the American people. He owes reality, not rhetoric. I don’t see another Member seeking recognition. I ask unanimous consent that the editorial in yesterday’s New York Times about Secretary Mattis be placed in the RECORD . There being no objection, the mate-rial was ordered to be printed in the R
ECORD , as follows: 
[From the New York Times, Dec. 20, 2018] J
IMMATTIS WASRIGHT—WHOWILLPROTECT  A
MERICA NOW? (By the Editorial Board) The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op- Ed section. Jim Mattis is stepping down as defense sec-retary, a day after President Trump over-ruled him and other top national security advisers by ordering the rapid withdrawal of all 2,000 American ground troops from Syria. Mr. Mattis, a retired four-star general, said in his letter of resignation that his views on a number of foreign policy and defense mat-ters were fundamentally at odds with those of the president. Mr. Mattis did not specifically mention the president’s seemingly impulsive decision on Syria, but he and other top aides were clear-ly caught by surprise. With Mr. Mattis’s de-parture, the last of the original group of grounded professionals who have, with at least partial success, restrained Mr. Trump on foreign and defense policy are now gone. It was less than three months ago that John Bolton, the national security adviser, spelled out a broader mission for the Amer-ican troops in Syria. At the time, it sounded like an authori-tative statement of official policy. Only, as is so often the case with Donald Trump’s chaotic presidency, it apparently wasn’t. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump summarily overruled Mr. Bolton and the rest of his na-tional security team with his abrupt and dangerous troop withdrawal decision. The move, detached from any broader strategic context or any public rationale, sowed new uncertainty about America’s commitment to the Middle East, its willingness to be a glob-al leader and Mr. Trump’s role as com-mander in chief. It appears to have been the final straw for Mr. Mattis, who has walked a tightrope for the past two years between his training and his conscience, and the whims of his presi-dent. He kept his concerns mainly to him-self, while slow-walking a number of Mr. Trump’s demands, like banning transgender troops and seeking a full-dress military pa-rade down Pennsylvania Avenue. Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Com-mittee, said in a tweet that Mr. Mattis’s de-parture was ‘‘scary.’’ He called him ‘‘an is-land of stability amidst the chaos of the Trump administration.’’ Soldiers have a duty to follow their leader and carry out lawful orders. But success de-pends on trusting that the leader knows what he’s doing and where he’s going. Sending conflicting orders to soldiers on the battlefield, as Mr. Trump and his admin-istration are doing, not only hampers morale and undermines allied forces like the Syrian Kurds, it could also risk getting American soldiers killed or wounded for objectives their commanders had already abandoned. Even some of Mr. Trump’s most ardent supporters were alarmed. ‘‘It is a major blun-der,’’ a Republican senator, Marco Rubio of Florida, wrote on Twitter. ‘‘If it isn’t re-versed it will haunt this administration & America for years to come.’’ Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, who generally supports Mr. Trump, said he and others in the national se-curity establishment were ‘‘blindsided’’ by the announcement. He called for congres-sional hearings on the decision. This isn’t the first time the president and his administration have sent mixed mes-sages. During the 2016 campaign, Mr. Trump promised to withdraw troops from Syria and has been looking for a way do it ever since. In April, he gave the Pentagon more time to complete the mission, which since the Obama era has been strictly focused on fin-ishing off the Islamic State. Then Mr. Bolton arrived on the job and declared that ‘‘we’re not going to leave as long as Iranian troops are outside Iranian borders, and that in-cludes Iranian proxies and militias.’’ As late as Monday, James Jeffrey, the State Department’s Syria envoy, told the Atlantic Council that the United States would stay in Syria until ISIS was defeated, Iranian influence was curbed and there was a political solution to the Syrian civil war. But on Wednesday, Mr. Trump undercut his advisers, and American interests, by re-versing course and declaring in a tweet, ‘‘We have defeated ISIS in Syria, my only reason for being there during the Trump Presi-dency.’’ There was no attempt to use the leverage of an American withdrawal to achieve any specific political or military goal. Mr. Trump’s assertion that the Islamic State is defeated is absurd. ‘‘We have won against ISIS,’’ he boasted in a video. The ability of the terrorists to strike has been significantly degraded and much of the terri-tory they claimed for their so-called caliph-ate has been liberated. But the group still re-tains a pocket of land on the Syria-Iraq bor-der and has roughly 20,000 to 30,000 fighters, according to military researchers. As Mr. Jeffrey said Monday, ‘‘The job is not yet done.’’ No one wants American troops deployed in a war zone longer than necessary. But there is no indication that Mr. Trump has thought through the consequences of a precipitous withdrawal, including allowing ISIS forces to regroup and create another crisis that would draw the United States back into the region. An American withdrawal would also be a gift to Vladimir Putin, the Russian leader, who has been working hard to supplant American influence in the region and who, on Thursday, enthusiastically welcomed the decision, saying, ‘‘Donald’s right.’’ Another beneficiary is Iran, which has also expanded its regional footprint. It would certainly make it harder for the Trump administra-tion to implement its policy of ratcheting up what it calls ‘‘maximum pressure’’ on Iran. Among the biggest losers are likely to be the Kurdish troops that the United States has equipped and relied on to fight the Is-lamic State in Iraq and Syria. Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, considers many of the Kurds to be terrorists bent on destroying his country. In recent days he has vowed to launch a new offensive against them in the Syrian border region. Mr. Trump discussed his withdrawal decision in a tele-phone call with Mr. Erdogan on Friday.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S8025 December 22, 2018 
The American withdrawal worries Israel, anxious about Iran’s robust military pres-ence in Syria, and Jordan, which bears a con-siderable burden from Syrian refugees who fled the fighting across the border. While Israel withheld criticism of Mr. Trump’s de-cision, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his government would escalate the fight against Iranian-aligned forces in Syria once the Americans leave. Decisions of such consequence normally are thoroughly vetted by a president’s na-tional security advisers. But congressional lawmakers said there were no signs that any process was followed, and a senior White House official, refusing to discuss internal deliberations, said Wednesday, ‘‘The issue here is the president made a decision.’’ Judging from the timing and tone of Mr. Mattis’ letter of resignation, the president made that decision alone. 
TRIBUTE TO JAMES MATTIS  
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, like so many Republicans and Democrats, I was stunned to hear that Secretary Mattis was going to be leaving. I understand his reasons. He has said he always felt a duty to uphold the in-terests and security of the United States and to uphold our agreements with other countries for the security of democracy. The President has dis-agreed with him on that. He feels oth-erwise. So Secretary Mattis feels the President should be entitled to have somebody who takes differing views. Unfortunately, General Mattis’s views are those that are the result of decades of service to this country as a marine in combat, as a marine com-mander, as a four-star general, and as one who has the strong respect of Re-publicans and Democrats alike. Cer-tainly, he has the strong respect of those who have served in the military and who know what it means to actu-ally stand up for this country, not just in rhetoric but by putting their lives on the line on the battlefield. I will always admire General Mattis. I applaud his service to the United States of America, and I know he is a man who can leave with his head held high. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN  
Mr. PERDUE. Mr. President, here we are at approximately 2:30 on a Satur-day afternoon trying to do the people’s business in a situation that nobody wanted. Yet because, I believe, of polit-ical self-interest, we are in a situation right now where we are in what I would call a crisis mode of operation. We need to get a deal done. But I want to address a couple of topics today that are at issue here as we de-bate the funding issue, which is at the crux of why we are here today and this weekend. Our country was built on immigra-tion; there is just no question that we are all direct derivatives, in one way or the other. But I would like to be very clear that most of the people who have come to this country over the last two centuries came in legally. Today, we bring in 1.1 million people a year—le-gally. We bring in about 70,000 people who have a job-related way to get into our system. There are about 70,000 di-rect family members; that is, a spouse and immediate children. There are an-other 300,000 refugees and asylum seek-ers. There is a rational reason we should do that, and we have been doing that. Today, every day, asylum seekers and refugees are permitted into our country, but there are another 800,000 who come in legally every year, and the only reason they come in is that they have an indirect family link, through generations, to the 70,000 that come in. Given that environment, we also have a temporary work permit system here that, again, has over 1 mil-lion people in it—every year. Our country is the most welcoming, philanthropic country in the history of the world. To think that just pro-tecting our borders as a national secu-rity issue is somehow hard-hearted and radical—no country in the history of the world has ever demonstrated that it was a radical thought to maintain and protect the sovereignty of their own country and their own borders. Indeed, there are only 6 reasons why 13 colonies came together in the first place in the late 18th century and formed the United States of America. The No. 1 reason articulated is to pro-vide for the common defense of our country. President Trump is leading right now in his first responsibility, and that is to protect every citizen of the United States of America. He is fighting for the American people. Actually, that is how he got elected. He got elected be-cause he complained about the dys-function in Washington, about politi-cians, bureaucrats, and the media. So did I, in 2014—2 years before President Trump did. I believe people are fed up with this dysfunction in Washington. I want to reemphasize that what is at issue here is the protection of our sov-ereignty as a country—not to change the immigration laws; that is not what is at debate today. I want to remind everybody that just in this body this year, 43 of my col-leagues across the aisle, in an immi-gration bill proposed by S
USAN COLLINS  on this side, 43 Democrats voted for a $25 billion border security package—43. I think President Trump has dem-onstrated tremendous negotiating will-ingness over and over, over this past year, on this issue.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES8026 December 22, 2018 
Let’s be clear what is going on. The flow of drugs and human trafficking on our border are completely unaccept-able. Everybody in this body agrees with that, demonstrated by the fact that 43 Democrats actually voted for a $25 billion border security package ear-lier this year. There is no way you can avoid admitting that. This has to stop. The undampened flow of illegal drugs has created a crisis in our country. The fact that we sit here and are more con-cerned about the political realities in Washington than we are about stopping human trafficking across our southern border is totally unacceptable. An open border goes against the very ideas of why our country was founded. It to-tally undercuts American sovereignty. The American people know that. They are fed up with the status quo, and I can tell you, firsthand, so is President Donald Trump. The Dems are very clear. My col-leagues have demonstrated that they prefer open borders, illegal drug trans-fers, and human trafficking to a com-monsense protection of our southern border. We know fences work. I have been to countries around the world where they are protecting their borders with sim-ple fences where they need them. We have multiple approaches to de-fending our southern border. We have many miles right now that already have similar fences up that deter ille-gal crossings. At the same time, this President has shown over and over again that he will work with our colleagues across the aisle to find some common solution here that we can all live with. He is ready to make a deal today. In fact, as we speak, the Vice President, the President, and the Chief of Staff are in the White House right now; the leader of the Democratic Party in the Senate is, right now, negotiating. This needs to get done. I have done dozens of these in my career, and look-ing at what is important to both par-ties, there is no reason this can’t get done. I believe the President is ready to make a deal to fully fund the Federal Government—the last 25 percent. Let’s remember how we got there. This body, the Senate and the House, did some-thing they haven’t done in 22 years, and that is fund at least 75 percent of our Federal Government on time. That was by September 30. We are here, at the end of our first quarter of the next fiscal year, still trying to fund the last 25 percent because of this controversy over the border wall. The first number was $25 billion, as I said, which was agreed to by the other side. Then, there was another $5 billion offered. Lastly, the President, I thought, had a deal earlier this week with our colleagues across the aisle for $1.6 billion. That deal was taken away. We are right now, I think, experi-encing the second Schumer shutdown of this year. The first was over the DACA controversy. President Trump took the Democratic request for 600,000 work permits for an indefinite period of time and changed that and made an offer of a pathway to citizenship for 1.8 million DACA recipients. He took a chance with the ultraright in our party, the conservative part of the party. He took a chance and stood up and said: This is the right thing to do, if it is paired with the right deal on the other side. I believe there is no reason we can’t get this package done right now. I think the President agrees with that. I think the Democratic leader agrees with that. But prior to yesterday, for a few days, there was no one talking. I give Mick Mulvaney and the Vice President a lot of credit. I know that the Vice President was in this building until about 9:30 last night negotiating this. I just believe it is time to get this done. N
ANCY PELOSI , in the House, repeat-edly said that President Trump couldn’t get the votes from the House to pass a funding package that in-cluded these border security priorities. We now know she was wrong. The votes were there. The House has sent a bill back over here that not only has bor-der security but a relief package—a se-rious relief package for hurricane vic-tims, disaster relief victims, and the wildfire victims in California. The U.S. Senate should have included President Trump’s priorities from the very beginning. Now this body has a chance to do the right thing. It is time to get this done. We are here. Let’s get a deal, bring it back in here, pass it, get it back to the House, and let’s stop this nonsense. Let’s not yield to political self-interest on either side. I implore all of us who have influence with the people who are negotiating this: Let’s get beyond this. This is so close. There is no reason we are sitting here, letting America be nervous about whether we are going to get this done. This should have been done back in September, as I said earlier. Now let’s focus on our national interests, the things we are all called to do in our oath of office: Protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. Let’s fully fund this government—the last 25 percent—move past this, secure our border, and provide disaster relief for the people who have a timely need, right now, for us to do that. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. M

By Mr. CARDIN (for himself, Ms. C

SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS 
SENATE RESOLUTION 741—EX-PRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE LETTER OF RESIGNATION OF SECRETARY OF DEFENSE JAMES MATTIS AND ON THE DECISION OF PRESIDENT TRUMP TO RAPIDLY WITHDRAW UNITED STATES FORCES FROM SYRIA Mr. WARNER (for himself, Mr. M
ENENDEZ , Mr. C OONS , Mr. R EED, Mr. B
LUMENTHAL , Mr. C ARPER , and Mr. V AN H
OLLEN ) submitted the following reso-lution; which was referred to the Com-mittee on Foreign Relations: 
S. R ES. 741 Whereas James Mattis served the United States with distinction over the course of a long career in the United States Marine Corp and as Secretary of Defense; Whereas the Senate concurs with the fol-lowing sentiments expressed in letter of res-ignation submitted by Secretary Mattis to President Trump: (1) The strength of the United States is in-extricably linked to the strength of our sys-tem of alliances and partnerships. (2) The United States cannot protect our interests or serve as the indispensable nation in the free world without those alliances and partnerships. (3) Maintaining that system of alliances and partnerships requires that the United States demonstrate respect for our allies. (4) While the Armed Forces of the United States cannot serve as the world’s police-man, the United States must use all tools of American power to provide for the common defense, including providing effective leader-ship to our alliances. (5) Those alliances and partnerships have assisted the United States in increasing our national security, for example when all North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) nations fought alongside the United States following the attacks of September 11, 2001, and when 74 nations joined the effort to de-feat the threat from the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). (6) The United States must demonstrate resolve and be unambiguous in our approach to countries whose strategic interests run counter to our own. (7) The Russian Federation and China wish to shape a world order consistent with their authoritarian model, allowing them to veto other nations’ economic, diplomatic, and se-curity decisions, and to promote their own interests at the expense of other nations, the United States, and our allies. (8) The United States must do everything possible to advance a rules-based inter-national order that is most conducive to our security, prosperity, and values, and our ef-forts in that regard are strengthened by the solidarity of our alliances. (9) United States military pressure has demonstrated considerable, but incomplete progress against global terrorist groups, par-ticularly al Qaeda, the group responsible for the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, who threaten the stability of the Middle East and the safety of the Amer-ican people and the citizens of many of our closest allies; Whereas there are a small number of troops on the ground in Syria to train, equip, advise, and assist United States partners in the Syrian Democratic Forces fighting the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria; Whereas the governments of the Russian Federation and Iran are fighting alongside the Assad regime against United States al-lies and interests; Whereas the abrupt decision of the Presi-dent to remove all United States forces in Syria without consultation enables Iran and the Russian Federation to expand their in-fluence and presence in Syria and beyond and threatens United States partners in Syria and Israel and other allies in the re-gion; and Whereas the decision of the President to precipitously withdraw United States troops will leave the people of Syria even more vul-nerable to violence from terrorist groups and provide time and space for al Qaeda and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria to reconsti-tute and launch attacks against the United States and our allies: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Senate— (1) expresses its gratitude to Secretary of Defense James Mattis for his decades of hon-orable service to the United States in the United States Marine Corps and at the De-partment of Defense; (2) expresses strong support for United States alliances and partnerships with allies around the world; (3) expresses concern with President Trump’s decision to rapidly withdraw United States forces from Syria, a decision taken without consultation with Congress or our allies and partners and without apparent concern for our national and collective inter-ests; and (4) believes that these decisions could fur-ther undermine United States leadership in the world, weaken our alliance and partner-ship structure, and make it harder to achieve a world more conducive to United States interests, including support for de-mocracy.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S8029 December 22, 2018 
SENATE RESOLUTION 742—DESIG-NATING THE FIRST WEEK OF DE-CEMBER 2018, AND SUPPORTING THE DESIGNATION OF EACH FIRST WEEK OF DECEMBER THEREAFTER, AS ‘‘CANCER SCREEN WEEK’’, IDENTIFYING THE BURDEN OF CANCER IN THE UNITED STATES, AND ENCOUR-AGING PEOPLE TO TALK WITH THEIR HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS ABOUT APPROPRIATE SCREENINGS FOR THE PREVEN-TION AND EARLY DETECTION OF CANCER Mr. JONES (for himself and Mr. P
ERDUE ) submitted the following reso-lution; which was considered and agreed to.: 
S. R ES. 742 Whereas the American Cancer Society esti-mates that, in 2018, more than 600,000 people in the United States will lose their lives to cancer; Whereas the National Cancer Institute es-timates that approximately 18,000 to 210,000 deaths in United States from cancer could be avoided through prevention and early detec-tion; Whereas the death rate from cancer dropped 25 percent between 1991 and 2014 be-cause of reductions in smoking and advances in early detection and treatment; Whereas, according to the American Can-cer Society, the 5-year relative survival rate for cancer detected at the local stage is ap-proximately 55 percent for lung cancer, 90 percent for colon and rectum cancers, 91 per-cent for cervical cancer, 99 percent for breast cancer, and 98 percent for melanoma of the skin; Whereas many of those cancers are often preventable and early detection and treat-ment are critical, as cancer does not always cause symptoms and many cancers occur in people with no family history of cancer; Whereas specific types of cancer dispropor-tionately affect different populations, for ex-ample— (1) breast cancer is the most common form of cancer among Black women; (2) the rate of prostate cancer among Black men is double the rate for other men; (3) the likelihood of developing colorectal cancer for Alaska Natives is double that of other people in the United States; (4) cervical cancer is more prevalent among Hispanic and Black women; (5) 2 out of 3 people diagnosed with lung cancer are 65 years of age or older; and (6) melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer, is one of the most common types of cancer among young adults; Whereas, according to the Centers for Dis-ease Control and Prevention, the rates of screening for many types of cancer among populations for which screenings are rec-ommended remain substantially below the targets set forth in the Healthy People 2020 report; Whereas it is critical to reinforce the need for people to discuss their individual risk factors for cancer with their healthcare pro-viders and understand the recommendations for, and benefits of, cancer screening; and Whereas it is critical that healthcare pro-viders present individuals who are diagnosed with cancer through screening clear and complete options for further diagnostic or molecular testing and treatment: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Senate— (1) encourages all people in the United States to talk with their healthcare pro-viders about their risk factors for all types of cancer, including breast, cervical, colon, lung, prostate, and skin cancer, and rec-ommended screening options; (2) designates the first week of December 2018 as ‘‘Cancer Screen Week’’; and (3) supports the designation of the first week of December as ‘‘Cancer Screen Week’’. f SENATE RESOLUTION 743—CON-GRATULATING THE INTER-NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF FIRE FIGHTERS ON THE 100TH ANNI-VERSARY OF ITS FOUNDING Mr. CARDIN (for himself, Ms. C
OL-
LINS, Mr. R EED, and Mr. V ANHOLLEN ) submitted the following resolution; which was considered and agreed to: 
S. R ES. 743 Whereas, on February 28, 1918, delegates representing 24 firefighter unions united to form the International Association of Fire Fighters (referred to in this preamble as the ‘‘IAFF’’) to ‘‘organize all fire fighters . . . foster a higher degree of skill and efficiency . . . improve and protect members’ health and welfare . . . establish safety standards . . . cultivate friendship and fellowship . . . provide proper compensation for work per-formed . . . and improve social and economic conditions’’; Whereas, in 1918, at the first IAFF Conven-tion, the IAFF adopted 20 resolutions to ben-efit firefighters and the fire service, includ-ing resolutions relating to— (1) a two-platoon system; (2) pension laws; (3) automatic sprinkler systems; (4) building inspections; and (5) the removal of hazards for fire preven-tion; Whereas, throughout the history of the IAFF, the IAFF has successfully improved the knowledge, skills and abilities of the do-mestic defenders of the people of the United States by designing, developing, and deploy-ing high quality standardized training in a multitude of disciplines, including— (1) hazardous materials response; (2) responding to incidents involving weap-ons of mass destruction; (3) confined space operations; (4) responding to incidents involving illicit drug labs; and (5) planning and responding to high-con-sequence incidents; Whereas the IAFF has been the national leader in every significant firefighter health and safety initiative for nearly a century, in-cluding— (1) the recognition of and fight against oc-cupational diseases and illnesses, such as cancer and cardiovascular ailments; (2) the promotion of physical fitness screening and training; and (3) the promotion of mental health and wellness, including awareness and treatment of post-traumatic stress; Whereas, on March 5, 2017, the IAFF opened the first-of-its-kind Center of Excel-lence for Behavioral Health Treatment and Recovery to provide science-based treatment to firefighters struggling with post-trau-matic stress and co-occurring health issues, such as substance abuse, depression, and anxiety; Whereas the mission of the Center of Ex-cellence for Behavioral Health Treatment and Recovery reinforces the commitment of the IAFF to prioritizing the safety and well- being of all IAFF members and provides a safe space for firefighters to seek treatment and heal; Whereas the IAFF actively works to secure the enactment of legislation at all levels of government that directly impacts the jobs, economic security, and safety of firefighters and emergency medical personnel, includ-ing— (1) the Federal Fire Prevention and Con-trol Act of 1974 (15 U.S.C. 2201 et seq.); (2) the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Com-pensation Act of 2010 (Public Law 111–347; 124 Stat. 3623); and (3) legislation establishing— (A) the Public Safety Officers’ Benefits Program (part L of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (34 U.S.C. 10281 et seq.)); (B) the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program (section 33 of the Federal Fire Pre-vention and Control Act of 1974 (15 U.S.C. 2229)); (C) the Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response Grant Program (sec-tion 34 of the Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act of 1974 (15 U.S.C. 2229a)); and (D) presumptive illness compensation in a majority of States; Whereas the IAFF has served as a leader in the widespread integration of fire and emer-gency medical services, ensuring that nearly all professional firefighters in the United States play a critical role in the delivery of emergency medical services as cross-trained, dual-role firefighters who are trained in both fire suppression and Emergency Medical Services response; Whereas the IAFF has partnered with the Muscular Dystrophy Association (referred to in this preamble as the ‘‘MDA’’) to raise funds to support the search for the cause of and cure for muscle diseases, including— (1) by declaring the MDA the charity of choice of the IAFF in 1954; and (2) by participating in Fill the Boot cam-paigns to raise more than $630,000,000 for the MDA; Whereas, in furtherance of the mission of the IAFF to aid IAFF members and their families in times of need, the IAFF estab-lished the IAFF Foundation to provide— (1) aid to professional firefighters and emergency medical personnel following nat-ural disasters; (2) assistance to IAFF members and their families for the treatment and care of burn injuries; (3) scholarships to the children of fallen IAFF members; and (4) maintenance of the Fallen Fire Fighter Memorial to honor IAFF members who have made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty; Whereas the IAFF memorializes the thou-sands of firefighters and emergency medical personnel who have made the ultimate sac-rifice in service of others, including— (1) the 343 firefighters who lost their lives on September 11, 2001; (2) the scores of firefighters and emergency medical personnel who have died in the years since September 11, 2001, of injuries and ill-nesses relating to the events of September 11, 2001; and (3) the firefighters and emergency medical personnel who have died of occupational dis-ease; Whereas each of the firefighters and emer-gency medical personnel who have made the ultimate sacrifice in service of others is fondly remembered and respected by IAFF members; Whereas, as of December 2018, the IAFF has headquarters in both Washington, DC, and Ottawa, Ontario, and represents more than 313,000 full-time professional fire-fighters and paramedics in more than 3,200 affiliates; Whereas, as of December 2018, greater than 85 percent of the population in communities throughout the United States and Canada is

protected by firefighters and paramedics who are members of the IAFF; Whereas the sustained and ongoing com-mitment of the members of the IAFF to the people of the United States and Canada serves the public interest; and Whereas countless firefighters from across the United States are honored at the Na-tional Fallen Firefighters Memorial created by Congress and located on the campus of the National Fire Academy in Emmitsburg, Maryland: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Senate— (1) congratulates the International Asso-ciation of Fire Fighters on the 100th anniver-sary of its founding; (2) recognizes the expertise and devotion to service demonstrated by the International Association of Fire Fighters as the Inter-national Association of Fire Fighters con-tinues to be the voice for and represent the professional interests of firefighters and emergency medical responders across the United States and Canada; and (3) respectfully requests that the Secretary of the Senate transmit an enrolled copy of this resolution to the General President of the International Association of Fire Fight-ers. f

CELEBRATING LIDERES CAMPESINAS’S THIRTIETH ANNI-VERSARY 
HON. RAUL RUIZ 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Saturday, December 22, 2018 Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to rec-ognize the thirtieth anniversary of Lideres Campesinas and to congratulate the incredible women of the Coachella Valley who founded it. For three decades, Lideres Campesinas has empowered farm working women across Cali-fornia to advocate for themselves, their fami-lies, and their communities in a struggle for equality. I was 16 when Lideres Campesinas was founded by friends and neighbors I’ve known my whole life. These were women who looked out for me and fed me tamales. One of the members even gave me the af-fectionate nickname, ‘‘mi chaparrito,’’ Mexican slang for short guy. Actually, she still calls me chaparrito. These women have deep connections to our community, but as farmworkers, they endure many hardships. Farmworkers don’t share the same protec-tions under our labor laws, and they often face difficult working conditions and wage discrimi-nation. On top of that, women farmworkers face higher rates of domestic violence and sexual assault, and a severe lack of legal resources and women’s health services. The founders of Lideres Campesinas experi-enced those hardships firsthand, so to fight for themselves and their community, they decided to organize. Maria Aguirre Rosales De Banuelos was one of those founders. Maria migrated to the U.S. in 1977, and she held a demanding agricultural job for twenty years. After being trapped in an abusive marriage for most of her life, Maria met with some of her farmworking neighbors in the Coachella Valley. In that room, she realized she was not alone: many of the women she spoke to had also experienced domestic abuse, and like her, finally felt the freedom to share their ex-periences with others. That realization gave Maria the strength to free herself from an abusive relationship, and to help create an organization that would con-nect and empower women in the Coachella Valley. That’s how Lideres Campesinas was born. Out of community. Out of compassion. And those are the values to which it has stayed true. Lideres Campesinas has since grown to in-clude chapters across California. By providing women with health education services, they are helping women live healthy and productive lives. By educating their communities about work-place harassment and labor exploitation, they have helped women stand up for their rights. And by connecting women with legal and social services, they have helped women rem-edy the discrimination they face. Maria Aguirre passed away earlier this year, but she will forever be remembered as an em-pathetic, kind-hearted leader of our commu-nity. To the women of Lideres Campesinas, thank you for your service to our community. A todas las mujeres de Lideres Campesina, gracias por su servicio a nuestras communidades.
