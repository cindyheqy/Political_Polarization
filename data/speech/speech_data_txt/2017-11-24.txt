TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT 
SPEECH OF  
HON. YVETTE D. CLARKE 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, November 16, 2017 Ms. CLARKE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 1, the so- called Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. This egregious bill would penalize families for having multiple children, reduce incentives for affordable housing units, hurt the sick by eliminating the medical expense deduction, harm commuters by limiting the benefit of the transit tax credit to employers, and harm New York in particular by limiting the state and local tax deduction, which helps New York provide valuable bene-fits to people of all income levels. Most importantly, this bill would add $1.5 trillion to our national debt, essentially paying for tax cuts to America’s wealthiest citizens today on the backs of our children tomorrow. This bill exposes the moral bankruptcy of the Republican agenda and I hope the American people will remember these actions in the fu-ture. I ask all of my colleagues to oppose this legislation.

OPPOSITION TO H.R. 2874 
HON. YVETTE D. CLARKE 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 24, 2017 Ms. CLARKE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 2874, the 21st Century Flood Reform Act. At a time when oceans are rising due to climate change, this Chamber wants to hike up the cost of flood in-surance premiums on lower- and middle-in-come Americans. As if that were not enough, this bill would also exempt corporations from the requirement to buy into the system, there-by limiting the availability of flood insurance in numerous markets. As the representative of Gerritsen Beach and other areas that were hit hard by Superstorm Sandy, I know the importance of ensuring that all Americans have access to quality flood insurance. While we need to en-sure that our insurance programs remain sol-vent, we must do so in a manner that protects the most vulnerable among us. This is not the way and I urge my colleagues to vote no.
