RESIGNATION OF NIKKI HALEY  
Mr. M CCONNELL. Mr. President, first, I want to convey a few words of thanks to our dedicated Ambassador to the United Nations, who we just learned will be stepping down at the end of the year. Our Nation has benefited greatly from the tough, skilled leadership that Nikki Haley brought to the U.N. Her tenure will be remembered for her proud reassertion of American moral leadership and her fearless willingness to turn a bright spotlight on critical challenges, from Israeli’s sovereignty to Iran’s sponsorship of regional vio-lence. Ambassador Haley has been a key part of the administration’s team that has faced down a wide variety of crit-ical challenges, and she has done so with distinction. She took on this role after an impres-sive 6 years as Governor of South Caro-lina and quickly proved to be both be a skillful advocate for our national in-terest and a forceful spokeswoman for our principles. I hope this is not the end of Ambas-sador Haley’s distinguished career in public service. I thank her for her sig-nificant contributions to our country. CONFIRMATION OF BRETT KAVANAUGH  
Mr. President, on another matter, yesterday, I was pleased to attend the ceremonial swearing-in for the newest member of our Supreme Court—Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Justice Kavanaugh’s remarks yester-day affirmed yet again what his record and his testimony clearly told us: He will be a thoughtful, fairminded Jus-tice who is committed to applying our laws and our Constitution as they are actually written. His confirmation last week was a vic-tory for the very same principles of fairness and justice we can now count on with him—along with his fellow Justices—to uphold. Saturday’s vote was also a victory for the Senate—for this institution— and for the integrity of this institu-tion. Reason and deliberation tri-umphed over what was literally—lit-erally—an attempt to sway the Senate using mob tactics. I wish this were an exaggeration, but it isn’t. While many came to Washington peacefully to share their stories, the loudest voices proved to be those of the politically motivated far left—the same far left special interests that had pledged total opposition to any Su-preme Court nominee before the ink

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES6704 October 9, 2018 
was even dry on Justice Kennedy’s re-tirement. They pulled out all the stops. They did everything they could. When it became clear Justice Kavanaugh’s nomination would not be stopped on the merits—well, as we know, that was only the beginning. The far-left activists decided that the U.S. Senate and their Members should be harassed and intimidated wherever they might be—in a restaurant with family, getting out of their own car, or in their own homes; anything went. When they did not get their way, when these tactics failed to sway us, they just turned up the anger even more. Protestors disregarded the men and women of the Capitol Police, tram-pled barricades, stormed the steps of the Capitol and the Supreme Court, climbed on statues, and tried to lit-erally shout down Senators right in the middle of a rollcall vote in the Senate. When the dust settled, literally hun-dreds of arrests had been made. Ex-traordinary security measures were re-quired to protect the Senate, the Su-preme Court, as well as the Kavanaugh family. Members of this body and Sen-ate staff have received threats of vio-lence and murder. After all that, I am afraid the far left had succeeded in only one thing: They made it even more difficult for the vast majority of Americans to take them seriously. They made it difficult for most Americans to take these people seriously. The madness hasn’t stopped. They are already signaling that even more drastic steps may be necessary now that Justice Kavanaugh is on the Court. Some leftwing publications are al-ready trying to lay the groundwork for—you guessed it—literally packing the Court with more Justices. That is right. The far left has gone scrounging through the ash heap of American his-tory, and they are bandying about that discredited fantasy from back in the 1930s. In the meantime, while the ground-work is laid for that scheme, one far- left pressure group is already trying to circulate petitions that Justice Kavanaugh should be impeached—Jus-tice Kavanaugh should be impeached. The mob would like to make them-selves perfectly clear. If Democrats were to retake Congress, ‘‘progessives expect them to use their full power to get Kavanaugh off the bench.’’ So it is pretty obvious. The all-con-suming animosity toward this nomi-nee, independent of all the facts and all the evidence, is still being stoked. The far-left mob is not letting up. Early today, former Secretary of State Clinton sent this signal as clear as day—this is Secretary Clinton. She told CNN exactly how she views mil-lions of Americans who hold different political views from her own. Here is what she said: 
You cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for. . . . If we are fortunate enough to win back the House and/or the Senate, that’s when ci-vility can start again. No peace until they get their way? More of these unhinged tactics? Apparently, this is the left’s rallying cry, but fortunately the American peo-ple know the fact-free politics of hate, fear, and intimidation are not how we actually govern in our democratic Re-public. The Senate and the Nation will not be intimidated. 
S. 3021 
Mr. President, on an entirely dif-ferent matter, earlier this year, the President challenged us to seriously address our Nation’s crumbling infra-structure. We have wasted no time in Congress on working to tackle this challenge in a bipartisan way. Here are just a few highlights: The funding bill for fiscal 2018 included a $21 billion increase in infrastructure funding. We continue to build on that significant commitment in our historic return to regular appropriations for fis-cal year 2019. Just last week, we passed the longest FAA reauthorization in more than three decades on an overwhelmingly bi-partisan basis. This week, we have the chance to keep the momentum going and advance another major victory for the American infrastructure by passing America’s Water Infrastructure Act. Chairman B
ARRASSO and Ranking Member C
ARPER deserve a lot of credit for getting this important bipartisan legislation across the finish line. Its importance for every State in our Na-tion really cannot be overstated. America’s ports and inland water-ways give our producers access to mar-kets around the world. For example, more than 60 percent of our grain ex-ports move through our inland water-ways and so do other commodities such as fuel, coal, and agricultural inputs. No wonder the American Farm Bu-reau Federation wrote the Senate, ex-plaining that this legislation ‘‘will put America’s inland waterways and port infrastructure on a solid and sustain-able foundation to contribute to U.S. economic growth, jobs and global com-petitiveness for generations to come.’’ This legislation covers big projects, like deepening ports and ensuring the navigability of inland waterways, but it also focuses on the unique challenges our local communities face. It will help ensure access to functioning sewer sys-tems and clean drinking water. On the last point, there is good rea-son why the chairman of the EPW Committee calls this legislation ‘‘the most significant drinking water infra-structure bill in decades.’’ When you look at its contents, it is hard to reach any other conclusion. There is more support for our rural communities as they grapple with aging water, sewer, and flood control infrastructure. The legislation includes Senator B
OOZMAN ’s SRF-WIN Act, which puts low-interest financing with-in reach for small and midsized rural communities, like those in my home State of Kentucky. For the first time in over 20 years, this legislation reauthorizes Federal funding to States to help ensure the safety of our drinking water. The legislation also addresses envi-ronmental protection. To name just one example, it includes an important effort championed by Senator RUBIO and Governor Scott to help address harmful algal blooms that have plagued Florida’s waterways. These are just a few of the significant accom-plishments this legislation secures. Dams and levees, flood control for our communities, safe drinking water, and sewer systems in communities big and small. The bill before us addresses real needs in my State and across America. I hope each of my colleagues will join me in voting to advance America’s Water Infrastructure Act later today. 
CONFIRMATION OF BRETT KAVANAUGH  
Now, on one final matter, I would like to conclude where I started, with a few words of thanks for a job well done. Justice Kavanaugh’s confirmation could not have happened without the tireless work of so many. So while I certainly can’t mention everyone who is deserving, I wish to take a moment to express my gratitude. First, of course, is President Trump himself, for sending to the Senate such a talented and qualified nominee. He and Vice President P
ENCE are stalwart champions for the judiciary that the American people deserve. My deep gratitude also goes to White House Counsel Don McGahn. Without Don’s total dedication to ensuring that Judge Kavanaugh received a fair hear-ing, we would not be where we are today. Here in the Senate, I can’t com-pliment enough our dear friend Chair-man G
RASSLEY for his leadership of the Judiciary Committee. He balanced strong leadership with generosity and flexibility to all of the Members. He oversaw the most thorough, pains-taking review of a Supreme Court nominee in our Nation’s history. Supporting Chairman G
RASSLEY and the committee, I would like to mention the following individuals: Staff Direc-tor Kolan Davis, Chief Nominations Counsel Mike Davis, Steve Kenny, Lauren Mehler, Andrew Ferguson, Tay-lor Foy, Rachel Mitchell, Katharine Willey, Jessica Vu, George Hartman, Jill Kozeny, and Jennifer Heins in Sen-ator G
RASSLEY ’s office, and an entire team of outstanding staff. Thanks are also due to the Repub-lican Whip, Senator C
ORNYN , and his excellent team, led by Monica Popp, and also to all of the dedicated floor staff who make this body function: Laura Dove, Robert Duncan, and the entire cloakroom team; the Secretary of the Senate, Parliamentarians, clerks, reporters of debates, Sergeant at Arms, and our doorkeepers. On my own team, I really cannot imagine this process—or really, my of-fice, at all—without the crucial leader-ship of Sharon Soderstrom, my chief of

staff. She works harder and achieves more, under more pressure, than al-most anyone I have ever had the privi-lege of working with. Don Stewart, my deputy chief of staff, is the expert hand who helps keep us on course and shapes our commu-nications strategy. Hazen Marshall, my policy director, helped to keep this and other priorities on track, including the other bipartisan policy wins the Senate delivered during the nomination de-bate. John Abegg is my chief counsel and right-hand man for every step of this process. For 15 weeks, John poured his determination, his experience, and his wisdom into this process. He started working the moment Justice Kennedy announced he was stepping down and did not stop until the gavel fell. We wouldn’t be here without his work. I am grateful to my policy advisers, my communications team, and my op-erations staff for all the hard work and late nights they poured into this proc-ess, and to Phil Maxson and my per-sonal office team for their assistance. But most important of all, I need to close with this. To the men and women of the United States Capitol Police and to all of the other law enforcement of-ficers who kept Members, staff, and citizens safe, even in extremely dif-ficult and often hostile circumstances, we really can’t thank them enough. Our representative government and the rule of law depend on their dedication, their bravery, and their sacrifice. So thank you so much for keeping the Senate safe. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. 
CANCER RESEARCH  
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, it was good to get back home to Texas over the weekend and on Columbus Day. I had a chance to travel to far West Texas, out to El Paso, TX, and catch up with some of my friends and constitu-ents there on some important issues they care an awful lot about. While we in Washington have been fo-cused on Brett Kavanaugh’s confirma-tion to the U.S. Supreme Court for the last 90 days or so, a lot of other impor-tant things have been happening back in Texas and around the country. For example, on August 1, Dr. Jim Allison, affiliated with the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, won the Nobel Prize in medicine, along with a researcher from Japan. This is really important work. It was a culmination of 25 years of ef-fort, and I am sure something Jim would have never even dreamed of as he grew up in the small town of Alice, TX, 45 minutes from Corpus Christi. He has come a long way since then. We are very proud of him, and today we send our congratulations to Dr. Allison and to the entire MD Anderson team on a tremendous accomplishment. Dr. Allison developed a new way to treat cancer using T cells. His method unleashes a patient’s immune system to attack tumors. In other words, it is your own immune system that is trig-gered to attack the tumors that are at-tacking the patient. This is called im-mune checkpoint therapy. It has re-sulted in the development of numerous drugs that have the potential to save lives. None other than our former President, Jimmy Carter, is now can-cer free because of this type of therapy, but he is just one of the most famous of many examples. In the not so distant past, cancer could be treated in only one of three ways: through surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy. A friend of mine gave me the book—I think it was a Pulitzer Prize winning book—called ‘‘The Em-peror of All Maladies,’’ which was also a documentary. To be honest, the way that the medical profession treated cancer in the early days was pretty primitive: surgery, radiation, or chem-otherapy. But now, thanks to people like Dr. Allison and MD Anderson, can-cer patients have other options. Dr. Allison is sometimes referred to as the ‘‘Godfather of cancer immunotherapy,’’ and the drugs he has helped to develop have now been ap-proved to treat not only melanoma and lung cancer but also Hodgkins lymphoma and cancers of the kidney, bladder, liver and stomach. But despite the great strides made by this Nobel Prize-winning Texan, immunotherapy is still in the very early stages of development. Dr. Alli-son said there are nearly 2,000 immunotherapy trials in progress around the Nation, including 200 at MD Anderson alone. That gives my col-leagues an idea of the number of people and the ongoing efforts that are work-ing to extend the scientific frontiers of cancer treatment. Much of this work, of course, would not be possible without the funding that is provided by the American tax-payer through State and Federal fund-ing. The National Institutes of Health remains the largest funding mecha-nism, but in Texas we have done our part by investing $3 billion over 10 years through the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas, com-monly known as CPRIT. Here in the Senate and in the House, working together with the administra-tion, we have been promoting cancer research in several overlapping ways. I recently met with Dr. Shanlin Shah and learned about the fascinating pro-ton therapy that MD Anderson has pio-neered. Conversations like that are a great way that we in Congress, who are obviously not experts, can try to stay on top of rapidly advancing research. But even more important is what we do here collectively to fund that re-search. We have increased funding by $2 billion to the National Institutes of Health. With that increase, close to $6 billion is now going to the National Cancer Institute, and an additional $100 million is being put toward the so- called Cancer Moonshot that Joe Biden and others touted and which all of us working together voted to create. The Moonshot will accelerate research re-garding high mortality cancers. As a part of the Moonshot initiative, the National Institutes of Health has partnered with biopharmaceutical companies to launch what is known as the Partnership for Accelerating Can-cer or PACT, as it is called. PACT is a 5-year public-private research collabo-ration totaling $215 million. Hopefully, it will identify new biomarkers and de-velop new immunotherapy treatments. Dr. Allison, whom I mentioned ear-lier, has spoken about how crucial this government funding effort really is. Of course, like I said, while we are caught up in the fights of the day here on the floor of the Senate, a lot of good work gets done that the American people don’t hear about. So that is why it is so important to emphasize this point. While biotech and pharmaceutical companies fund the late-stage research that brings well-developed therapies into clinical trials, the early funding of basic science, which makes that pos-sible, often comes from the money pro-vided by the U.S. Government through the National Institutes of Health. Without it, Dr. Allison said, ‘‘many of the therapies that currently treat mil-lions of cancer patients worldwide sim-ply wouldn’t exist.’’ That is an important point too. It is not just treating cancer here in Amer-ica. The science and the developments, the research and the cures that are de-veloped at places like MD Anderson Hospital in Houston, TX, benefit the whole world. I remember one of the last times I was at MD Anderson for a townhall meeting with Senator MCCONNELL , the majority leader, and Senator John McCain, our recently departed col-league from Arizona. At the time, I was told that patients from 90 different countries come to MD Anderson in Houston, TX, because of their expertise treating cancer. So this is not just a local or national phenomenon. This is a worldwide phe-nomenon. It is not just the government, of course, that helps to fund this impor-tant research. Philanthropists are also invaluable when it comes to this sort of research as well. I am thinking about my friends Peggy and Lowry Mays of San Antonio, TX. Thanks to their generosity, San Antonio’s pre-mier cancer center, which is one of only four in Texas with the National Cancer Institute’s elite designation, is entering into an entirely new era. Their donations and their generosity will provide an endowment to support the director of the cancer center, and it will also fund new faculty recruitment and retention initiatives for genera-tions to come. This is just another way

that generous people with big hearts are making a difference. It is not just government. It is government working together with people like the Mays to get these things done. What all of this shows, of course, is that when serious and sustained effort is applied and money is invested, there is a lot of progress that we can make in dealing with things that never would have even been considered treatable years earlier, not that many years ago, and there is always more to be learned. This calls to mind something the great Thomas Edison, the inventor of the light bulb, once said: ‘‘When you have exhausted all possibilities, re-member this—you haven’t.’’ We haven’t exhausted all possibilities, as Dr. Allison’s path-breaking work clear-ly shows—not even close. We have so much more to discover and understand. With science advancing at practically lightning speed, I believe it is not a question of if we cure cancer but when. That comes as good news for families all across this country of ours because almost no family has been spared. Even when we don’t have a close friend or immediate family member who has un-dergone radiation treatment or chemo-therapy, we know stories of famous people, such as Steve Jobs, Aretha Franklin, and even our friend John McCain, recently departed. They passed away from pancreatic cancer and glioblastoma. For others we know, it was oral cancer or lung cancer. Can-cer respects no persons and observes no differences between the wealthy and the poor or race or ethnicity. But if we are lucky, we are also blessed to know cancer survivors who, thanks to med-ical innovation, have a new shot at life. They have undergone hardships and treatment that the rest of us might find difficult to even imagine, but they have endured by their spirit, and they have inspired all of us to keep working, whether it be at the Mays Cancer Cen-ter in San Antonio, at MD Anderson in Houston, or up here in Washington, where we work to fund research through legislation. Like Thomas Edi-son said, we will never exhaust all of the possibilities, so we must not give up. We must keep trying. Working with generous donors, as well as undaunted scientific research-ers like Dr. Allison and his team, I hope we will continue to apply our time and talents to finding answers and yielding newer and greater discov-eries. To all the younger generations— some in towns not unlike Alice, TX—to all of those who are wondering what they might want to be when they grow up, look no further than Dr. Jim Alli-son. Look how much he has accom-plished through his life’s work. He is a good example of the type of person you can aspire to be and what is possible if you try. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. 
CLIMATE CHANGE  
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about something that is such an urgent challenge for our Nation and the world; that is, cli-mate change. Over the weekend, we re-ceived the most recent and most dire warning of the costs of inaction yester-day when the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issued its re-port. It wasn’t easy to break through the news in the last week. We all know there was a lot going on, but this one did. Why did this break through the news? First of all, it was such a com-prehensive report. It was a product of 91 scientists from 40 countries. They looked at more than 6,000 studies, and they concluded, absent major changes in our greenhouse gas emissions, the devastating consequences of climate change are coming much sooner than previously expected. I think that is why it made front page news—because of the timeline. I think a lot of times people think of something that maybe their grandkids or great-grandkids are going to have to deal with, but, no, actually the pages in this room—young people today, peo-ple even in my generation—are going to have to be dealing directly with the frontline consequences of climate change. The report predicted that the atmos-phere will warm up by as much as 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit above preindustrial levels by 2040. That is just over 20 years. Think about the pages in this room. Twenty years from now might seem long, but it is not that long at all. Just 20 years ago, we could see per-sistent droughts—we are already seeing a number of droughts now—food short-ages, worsening wildfires—think of what we have already seen in Colorado and California on the west coast—and increased coastal flooding, damage that could cost $54 trillion. This is about loss of life, loss of quality of life, and this is about loss of money and loss of people’s incomes. As the authors of the report make clear, it will take immediate action to avoid these catastrophic consequences for our country and our world. First, by 2030, we must reduce greenhouse gas pollution by 45 percent from 2010 levels. Second, by 2050, we must increase our use of renewable energy, such as wind and solar, by as much as 47 percent. Do you know what? We can do this. If we don’t do anything, we are going to face dire consequences. When I first came to the Senate, we started hearing from military people and from scientists from all over the world about what we could see even in the next 10 years, 20 years, 30 years. So much of that has already come true. Imagine if we do nothing, and we keep on this trajectory. The American people understand it. I hear about the climate issue every-where I go in my State—from hunters in Northern Minnesota to people who like to snowmobile and cross-country ski, to business leaders in the Port of Duluth, to students at the University of Minnesota. Increasingly, warmer temperatures are having dramatic effects all over the northern part of our country. Lyme disease has spread further north. Aspen forests are shrinking. Moose range is declining. There is thirty-seven percent more rainfall as a result of mega rain-storms than we saw 50 years ago. The ragweed pollen season has extended 3 weeks in the Twin Cities in just the past 20 years. Those are facts. When you think about the effect that has on animals, think about the effect that has on our daily lives, and then think about what would happen if we kept going that way, not just this way but that way in the next 20 years. This is in stark contrast to comments made by some who still suggest the climate change debate isn’t settled. I couldn’t disagree more. I know we had a vote in this Chamber where something like 98 or 99 Senators voted that climate change is occurring. There may not be agreement on what we should do about it, but there better be soon. I am a former prosecutor, so I believe in evidence. As this U.N. report shows us, the facts and the science couldn’t be clearer. I suggest that everyone read about it or read summaries, which are easily available. Every week seems to bring fresh evidence of the damage cli-mate change is already causing, and Americans will feel the consequences. My State may be miles and miles away from rising oceans, but the im-pacts are not less of a real threat to my State. Climate change isn’t just about melting glaciers, although we sure have seen those. Anyone who vis-its Glacier National Park—I went with my family—can literally see over time, decade by decade, the changes to those glaciers. I once visited Greenland with a number of Senators, including Repub-lican Senators, and you could see what is happening there as major icebergs and parts of their ice sheets are break-ing off and disappearing. You can see the physical evidence of this. You can see the photographs of this. It is not just about that. Recently, we have seen the dev-astating impact of natural disasters, like Hurricane Florence and the cata-strophic flooding this summer through-out Southern Minnesota in Duluth. There may be some political division around climate change; that is putting it mildly. But there isn’t any real sci-entific division because nearly all of the scientists in this world believe this is happening. I will never forget an episode from the John Oliver show, which is a hu-morous program to watch, but it brings

real issues to light. To show that kind of scientific division, he decided to have a bunch of scientists on the stage with him. They were wearing their white coats. He had something like 97 or 98 scientists on one side in their white coats and 1 or 2 on the other side. That is the division. It is not real divi-sion if you are someone who believes in evidence. Climate change is occurring, and this latest report is from the sci-entists all over the world who would have no reason to do this except to warn people about the truth. That is why they are doing this. As citizens, we have an obligation to learn about it, to understand it, and to support ideas that will not hold us back dramatically but will allow us to tackle this head-on. If we don’t tackle this issue, we are going to continue to struggle with the far-reaching eco-nomic and environmental con-sequences. This report makes clear that those risks aren’t far off in the fu-ture for your great-great-great-great- great-great grandchildren; no, they could become a crisis as soon as 2040. Shifting global trends have the po-tential to wreak more subtle, long- term havoc on our businesses and in-dustries. That is why so many busi-nesses in my State support doing some-thing about climate change. Some-times it is because they have cus-tomers all over the world—all over the world in areas that are going to be the first hit by tsunamis and other weather events or it is because they simply want to be good corporate citizens or it is because they see their bottom line and how it is going to be affected if we don’t do something about this. The U.N. report details the economic damage that will happen if we fail to act, including losses of roughly 1.2 per-cent to our gross domestic product for every 1.8 degrees of warning. As it gets hotter, the GDP does go down. As a Senator from a State with a strong agricultural industry and a tra-dition of hunting, fishing, snowmobiling, and skiing, climate change is not only a direct threat to our State’s economy, it is also a threat to our quality of life, to the way we grew up, to enjoying the outdoors with our friends and our families. When President Trump announced that the United States would withdraw from the international climate change agreement last summer, I heard a lot from people in our State. As you all know, 195 countries made a pledge to come together to combat climate change, and in withdrawing, the United States was initially one of only three countries that would not be in the agreement. The other two coun-tries that weren’t in the agreement were Syria and Nicaragua. Well, now Syria and Nicaragua have signed the accord, so the United States is now the only country not to sign the accord. Our decision to leave this agreement sent the wrong message to the rest of the world—the wrong message. The lack of leadership has led to other countries discussing backing out of the agreement. That is not leadership. That is not leading from the front. We can’t have this happen. America should be leading and helping the world move forward. By the way, there is such an innova-tion space here, so much money to be made by responding to this in a smart way and developing new vehicles and developing new energy and new ways to deal with this challenge. It isn’t just a challenge; it is also an opportunity. If we don’t seize that opportunity by get-ting our own act together, by admit-ting that it is a problem and giving in-centives to our businesses to go in the right direction and to bring other countries with us, we are going to lose that opportunity to other countries that are part of this international coa-lition. I have already talked to people who work in government or who work for businesses that have gone to inter-national meetings and who have said: Do you know what some of these peo-ple in other countries say? I think we are going to work with China on this. They are part of that agreement. Hey, we are going to buy our solar panels from them, or we are going to do work with them on this. You can’t hide from the fact that we withdrew from that agreement, and it hurts not just our environment, it hurts our economic opportunities going forward. Look at Minnesota and what has hap-pened because we were out front on this. I am proud that our State has taken an incredibly proactive and inno-vative approach to energy use and sus-tainability, which is critical to ad-dressing carbon emissions. Our State’s renewable energy standard requires that 25 percent of our electricity come from renewable sources by 2025. We passed that way back in 2007 with—get this—a Republican Governor, Governor Pawlenty. He helped lead the way on that and worked with the legislature of Democrats and Republicans to pass what was at the time seen as a very ag-gressive standard. We did it by com-bining it with doing something about biofuels—something that is important not just in Minnesota but in the Pre-siding Officer’s State of North Dakota. We were able to put together that kind of coalition—the leaders in our legislature and the Governor, farmers and workers, environmentalists—to move forward on biofuels so we would have diversity in our fuel supply as well as diversity in our energy supply. So we don’t rely on just one type of en-ergy, and we reduce greenhouse gases by having an ‘‘all of the above’’ energy approach. The legislation back then in 2007 re-ceived overwhelming bipartisan sup-port, passing the Minnesota House 123 to 10 and the Minnesota Senate 63 to 3. It has been a while since we have reached that kind of consensus on the Federal level when it comes to energy. What has happened? We have more than met those goals. What has hap-pened nationally? Well, there was progress made during the Obama ad-ministration. When I first got here in 2007, I personally thought that we should move to some kind of a renew-able electricity standard for the whole country, maybe making differences by geographic areas and regions. Sadly, the decision was not made to go that way. I think we lost it by one vote. We lost it by one vote. Instead, the deci-sion was made on one side that we wanted to be more aggressive—and we tried with cap and trade, but that didn’t end up getting passed in the Sen-ate—and then on the other side, to kind of say: Well, let’s just see what happens. As a result, in my mind, we have not done nearly enough. What has happened instead? Well, the States, our laboratories of democracy, have moved ahead—many of them, like Minnesota—and are coming up with their own standards or doing it by re-gion. Our universities have moved ahead, our cities have moved ahead, and our businesses have moved ahead. By 2015, 154 companies, including com-panies I am very proud of—major com-panies in my State, such as Target, Best Buy, General Mills, and Cargill— had signed a pledge demonstrating their support for action on climate change that takes a strong step toward a low-carbon, sustainable future. These companies collectively employ more than 9 million people and represent more than $3 trillion in annual rev-enue. Last month at the Alliance to Save Energy gala, I got to present an Energy Efficiency Award to Target because of the work they have done with sustain-ability and righting the impacts of cli-mate change. They have created an electric car program that is up and running in 5 States, and they plan to expand that number to 20 in the next 2 years. They signed a virtual power pur-chase agreement with the Stephens Ranch wind farm in Texas as part of their goal of sourcing 100 percent re-newable energy in their U.S. oper-ations. Like so many companies in the United States, they have started a major solar program and are com-mitted to establishing rooftop solar panels on 500 of their stores by 2020. As of last year, they had already finished 436 of their projects. They are not alone. Xcel Energy, Minnesota’s largest utility, was an early supporter of the Obama adminis-tration’s Clean Power Plan. If we had allowed that to go through and had that in place, imagine what a better position we would be in when we read headlines like those from this morning about the U.N.’s report and the dire predictions of what we are going to see in 20 years. But, no, we are in what I consider a state of paralysis. Maybe we are not making things worse, although when we took away those gas mileage standards—when the administration went back on that—we made them worse. We sure aren’t mak-ing them better.

States, we are making progress, but we should be doing this together as a na-tion. Xcel Energy is another example of a company that appears to be ahead of the Federal Government. They sup-ported the Obama administration’s Clean Power Plan and announced plans to reduce carbon emissions by 60 per-cent in the next 15 years. I look at it this way: If companies like Target and Xcel Energy under-stand the need to reduce our use of fos-sil fuels and embrace the energy of the future, then so should Members of Con-gress, and so should this administra-tion. We know that energy innovation can’t take root—not in any serious way—without certainty and stability on what those incentives are. That is what that Clean Power Plan was about. It took what I considered a more mod-erate route than some people thought it was going to take, but then it got pulled back by this administration. It is very hard to start planning for the future if we don’t have a route for these companies to go. The rest of the world is getting on board. We don’t want to be following; we want to be leading in America. As this week’s report made clear, in-action is not an option for our econ-omy, for our environment, for our country, or for the world. Military and security experts have repeatedly re-minded us that climate change is a threat to our national security, in-creasing risks of conflict, humani-tarian crisis, and damage to critical in-frastructure. We see the stories of some of the ref-ugees who are not coming up from con-flict but are coming up from parts of Africa where they used to do subsist-ence farming but can no longer do that kind of subsistence farming because it is too dry, there are too many droughts, and the world has changed. We are going to see these humongous movements of people because they can’t live where they used to live. It is much better for us if we take this on as a world and do something about it than deal with the repercus-sions of it—more severe weather, heat waves that could reduce our water sup-ply, extreme rainfall that could dam-age critical infrastructure, and a de-crease in agricultural productivity that could threaten my State’s $20 bil-lion agricultural industry. People around the country understand the stakes, but this place—I think it needs just a little more imagination. If you ever visit my office, I have a picture on the wall, and it is a picture of an angel, and she is handing off the world to some outstretched hands. The words on the picture read: ‘‘The angel shrugged, and she said, ‘If we fail this time, it will be a failure of imagina-tion.’’’ That is what we need right now in Washington, DC—imagination to deal with a very clear threat that the scientists have put right in front of us. Twenty years from now, it is going to be worse than those wildfires we see raging in California and Colorado. Twenty years from now, it is going to be worse than what we are seeing when it comes to the hurricanes and the tsunamis and all of the icebergs melt-ing and what we are seeing in our na-tional parks. Why would we just let this happen? We are America. We are leaders. It is time to act. I yield the floor. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER  
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized. 
HEALTHCARE  
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, well, now that the Senate has concluded its very divisive debate about the Supreme Court, it is time to talk about the No. 1 issue to the American people: healthcare. We begin that debate to-morrow, when the Senate will take up a Democratic motion to repeal the Trump administration’s effort to ex-pand short-term insurance plans. Let me be clear. These so-called short-term plans are junk insurance. Short-term plans are junk insurance. People who buy them are going to be extremely disappointed because they bait the consumer in with low prices but hardly cover anything. They might not cover maternity care, mental health care, prescription drugs—you name it. Even worse, the plans draw consumers out of the health insurance market, making it more expensive for everyone else to purchase insurance, especially more expensive for those with preexisting conditions. That is why so many prominent pa-tient and consumer groups have filed a lawsuit against the administration’s rule to expand these junk plans. Groups like the American Cancer Soci-ety, the AARP, the Lung Association, the Diabetes Association, and others that represent millions of Americans with preexisting conditions have clear-ly said that this is sabotage—sabo-tage—of the insurance market and will drive up costs for millions of Ameri-cans. So Senator B
ALDWIN has introduced a CRA disapproval resolution—a resolu-tion brought under the Congressional Review Act—to repeal this fundamen-tally misguided policy from the Trump administration. All of my colleagues should vote for this, but I suspect my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have a different idea because ever since taking control of Congress and the Presidency, Republicans have delib-erately, relentlessly undermined Amer-icans’ healthcare. This particular policy is part of a long campaign to sabotage our healthcare system. Remember, nearly every Republican was silent when President Trump canceled the program that helped low-income Americans af-ford insurance. Remember, every Re-publican was silent when President Trump directed his administration to stop helping Americans sign up for the right policy. Remember, nearly every Republican was silent when President Trump’s Justice Department refused to defend protections for preexisting con-ditions. A large number of Republican attorneys general—some running for the Senate right now—were part of the Trump administration’s efforts to say it is just fine to get rid of protections for those with preexisting conditions. Remember, nearly every Republican voted to gut Medicaid, raise premiums on older Americans, repeal protections for Americans with preexisting condi-tions, and move us toward a future where 20 million fewer Americans have healthcare. Remember, every single Republican voted to repeal the cov-erage requirement and cause premiums to be much higher this year than they needed to be. So Americans, when you are paying more for insurance and you hate it, when those deductibles go up, those co-payments go up, and you say: Where is the insurance that was supposed to protect me? I have taken so much money out of my own pocket. It is hardly worth it. Look to the other side of the aisle, and look at what your Sen-ators have done, if you come from a State where they represent you. As a result of the Republican sabotage, pre-miums are up, out-of-pocket costs are up, prescription drug costs are up, and the quality of insurance is down—in many cases way down. Under this Re-publican President and this Republican Congress, Americans are paying more to get lower quality health insurance. Americans, under this President, this Congress, are paying more to get less when it comes to health insurance. Protections for preexisting condi-tions are under assault in so many dif-ferent ways. No wonder why, in poll after poll, Americans put healthcare as the No. 1 issue in the upcoming elec-tion. Tomorrow the Senate will have an opportunity to undo a portion of the Republican campaign to sabotage healthcare. In November, the American people will have a golden opportunity to move our country in a dramatically different direction by voting for Democratic candidates who will work to improve our healthcare rather than so many of those Republican candidates who, in obeisance to the big insurance compa-nies, work to destroy it. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. J

floor so we can make the much needed improvements to our Nation’s water infrastructure. I would also like to ex-press my appreciation to the hard- working staff of the Environment and Public Works Committee who spent lit-erally countless hours working on this important water infrastructure legisla-tion. The path to getting this bill to the Senate floor has not been easy, and it would not have happened without the strong bipartisanship shown by EPW leaders. This bill gets us back on track to au-thorize critical water infrastructure projects across the country every 2 years, ensuring our economic vitality and competitiveness. America’s Water Infrastructure Act is in lockstep with President Trump’s vision for infra-structure by growing our economy, cutting redtape, protecting our citizens and their property, and improving transparency, all the while being fis-cally responsible. I am particularly pleased, this bill also includes the Securing Required Funding for Water Infrastructure Now Act or SRF WIN Act legislation that I had an opportunity to introduce with Senator B
OOKER . The SRF WIN Act was a truly bipartisan effort, and I would like to give special thanks to our co-sponsors, Senators B
ARRASSO , CORNYN , I
NHOFE , CAPITO , W ICKER , HYDE-SMITH, F
EINSTEIN , CASEY , BALDWIN , MANCHIN , and Senator W
HITEHOUSE . The fact that the SRF WIN Act has cosponsors from across the country with vastly different political ideologies makes an important point that infrastructure investment is not a rural issue or a big city issue. It is not a red State or blue State problem. This is a national emergency, and it is time we put partisanship aside and show the American people we can work together to provide safe and reliable drinking water and wastewater services to Americans in every part of the coun-try. The SRF WIN Act is a result of months-long negotiations. It blends the best ideas available to ensure this com-monsense, bipartisan legislation will work effectively and efficiently, pro-viding millions and potentially billions in project dollars to communities that have traditionally not had access to these types of funds. What the SRF WIN Act does is sim-ple. It combines the efficiency and trust associated with the State Revolv-ing Funds with the leveraging power of the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act. This legislation makes the process easier and more affordable for States and communities to access Federal water infrastructure funding. Simply put, the SRF WIN Act is a crit-ical component to future water infra-structure financing. Congress needs to do a better job pro-viding basic public services such as safe roads, bridges, and an up-to-date water infrastructure system. By pass-ing America’s Water Infrastructure Act of 2018, Congress has made water infra-structure investment a top priority. This bill is a victory for job creators, small and large businesses, every single State across the country, and con-sumers. I am pleased to see support for this bill in the House, the Senate, and the White House. I urge my colleagues to pass this im-portant legislation, and I again thank Chairman BARRASSO , Ranking Member C
ARPER , Senators I NHOFE and C ARDIN  for their strong bipartisan work. They set a great example of the good policy outcomes that can be accomplished if we work together.

HEALTHCARE  
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, we re-ceive a lot of letters in our offices, and primarily we pay attention to those that come from our own home States. People expect me as their Senator to read the letter and to at least consider their point of view. Some of these let-ters are kind of routine, almost form letters. Some emails come in at a vol-ume we can hardly keep up with. In Il-linois, I receive 10,000 emails a week— a week. That is a lot. There was a time when I was a col-lege kid working here on Capitol Hill, and the Senator from Illinois signed every letter that went out of the of-fice—sat at the desk and signed the let-ters. It is inconceivable now that we can respond to all the letters each day. We try to keep up with them, we try to be timely, and we pick those letters out that are personal and important enough that the staff thinks I should read them personally, and I make a point of doing it. Sometimes the stories they tell give me an insight into the issues we debate on the floor of the Senate. Most of the time the American peo-ple look at us puzzled, asking: What are they talking about, and why does this mean anything to my family and my future? Let me give you an example of a cou-ple of letters I received that relate to a vote we are going to take this week. The first letter was from Richard and Mary Laidman, from Naperville, IL, which is west of the city of Chicago, in DuPage County. Richard and Mary wrote: ‘‘Our 13- year-old son Sam was diagnosed with leukemia one day after the ‘no pre-ex-isting conditions exclusions for kids’ protection went into effect.’’ They went on to say to me: ‘‘Obvi-ously, we are feeling dependent on all the clauses of the [ACA] right now—in-cluding [the] no pre-existing conditions exclusions.’’ The bottom line, the Laidmans say, is ‘‘junk insurance plans,’’ the ones that are so cheap they don’t cover any-thing important. ‘‘Junk insurance plans’’ wouldn’t cover their son. It would leave him and the family to fend for themselves in the individual mar-ket. Do you know what it is like to go into the individual market as a mother and father and try to find health insur-ance for a 13-year-old son who has been diagnosed with leukemia? Maybe you can’t find any, but if you could, it would be so expensive that you might not be able to afford it. The Affordable Care Act changed that, and it said: If you are going to offer health insurance plans in this country, you cannot dis-criminate against Americans with pre-existing conditions. You have to cover everybody—bring them all in. We do that in Medicare. We say when you reach Medicare eligibility: All aboard. Everybody is invited in. But for the longest time, private health insurance companies wanted to pick and choose. They wanted healthy people who can pay premiums. They would rather not pay these bills so they excluded a lot of people with pre-existing conditions. Sam, age 13 and diagnosed with leu-kemia, would be one of the victims of that old-time approach. The Leukemia and Lymphoma Society recently stat-ed: 
People diagnosed with cancer on a short term plan soon discover these plans fail to cover even lifesaving cancer treatments. If patients on short term plans can get access to cancer therapies at all, they will often be left with hundreds of thousands of dollars in medical bills. 
TAMMY BALDWIN is a Senator from the State of Wisconsin. She is going to offer to the Senate tomorrow a chance to vote against President Trump’s plan that would eliminate protection for preexisting conditions. We will get a chance to be on record here. I think it is long overdue. None of us knows what tomorrow will bring. We don’t know if tomorrow will bring an accident or a diagnosis, and, all of a sudden, your happy, healthy family has a challenge you never dreamed of. It has happened to my fam-ily. I will bet it has happened to most of yours. The question is, Are we going to de-mand of health insurance companies that they cover those with preexisting conditions or are we just going to tell those families: Fend for yourself. See what happens. See how much it costs. Another letter is from Watseka, IL, from the McTaggart family. Watseka is south of Chicago, in Iroquois County, a rural county, with big towns like Watseka and Milford. It is a great little place. Here is a letter from Christine McTaggart. She was originally diag-nosed with stage III inflammatory breast cancer. Given this type of ag-gressive cancer, her prognosis was not

good. She went through 16 cycles of chemo, a bilateral mastectomy, 33 ra-diation treatments, failed reconstruc-tion and chronic tissue issues, and a thyroid cancer diagnosis. After all that, she learned the breast cancer was back. This time she was stage IV. In her letter to me, Christine said: 
When the ACA became law, I had no idea that my life would come to depend on poli-cies such as pre-existing conditions not ex-cluding you from coverage. 
She ends with this quote: 
I thank you for your tireless advocacy on this issue. . . . My life, literally, depends on it. 
We pass a lot of resolutions here for ‘‘National Pickle Week’’ and saluting the flag. All of that is part of my job. Occasionally, an issue comes to the floor of the Senate that is really going to affect life-and-death issues for Americans all across our Nation. This is one of them. This is the No. 1 issue in this election. You might think our debate last week about a Supreme Court Justice was important, but you ask families back in Illinois: What do you really care about? They say: Senator, that was an im-portant debate. I care about my family. I care about my health insurance. I want to make sure of two things. I want to make sure I can afford it, and I want to make sure that when I buy it, it is worth owning and it is there when I need it. The Republican view on this is this: Buyer beware. Go out in the market-place. Shop around. Buy yourself some-thing cheap, like a junk insurance plan. It may not be there when you need it, but boy, the premiums will be low. That is not much confidence in insur-ance, if that is the case, and that is why, when T
AMMY BALDWIN , Senator of Wisconsin, offers us a chance to vote— I think, as soon as tomorrow—on this Trump rule, I hope we will get at least two Republicans who cross the aisle and join us. If they are listening at home, they will, because if they are lis-tening at home, they know that fami-lies really care about this issue of pre-existing conditions. It is so important for us. You look at the groups that have come out in opposition to President Trump’s junk insurance plans. They are the most important groups that you could think of. The American Can-cer Society stated that President Trump’s junk plan rule would ‘‘leave older and sicker Americans in the indi-vidual market with few, if any, afford-able health coverage choices’’ and that ‘‘patients living with serious condi-tions will be left paying more for the coverage they need, if they can afford coverage at all. In recent months, I have heard a lot of congressional Republicans proclaim to care about people with preexisting conditions, especially those up for re-election. These are the same ones who have eagerly voted to repeal the Af-fordable Care Act in the middle of the night. I have been in the Senate for a few years. That was one vote I will never forget. John McCain walked through those doors in the middle of the night, stood at that table, and with his arms still restricted because of the torture he went through as a veteran in the Vietnam war, he could barely lift his right arm with his thumb pointed down, saying no. That ‘‘no’’ vote, to-gether with two other Republicans, saved health insurance coverage for millions of Americans. But the Trump administration isn’t finished. They found new ways to re-duce coverage for American families and to raise costs. That is what the Trump plan is all about, and that is what we get a chance to vote on. The Senate is broken out in 51 Re-publicans and 49 Democrats. If all of the Democrats vote for TAMMY BALD-
WIN, and I think they will, we still need two Republicans. Let’s see if they will come over and vote not only against the Trump plan but vote for the mil-lions of families like those who I have read about today on the floor who are counting on quality health insurance to be there when they need it, who be-lieve that no one should discriminate against someone because of a pre-existing health condition. That, to me, seems fundamentally fair. I have raised a child with a serious problem. We face this time and again. Nobody should have to face it. A vote for T
AMMY BALDWIN ’s resolution of dis-approval on the Trump plan tomorrow will put America on the right course for families that need health insurance they can count on. I yield the floor.

S. 3021 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the Water Resources De-velopment Act, the cloture motion of which we will be voting on very short-ly. I strongly support moving forward with this legislation, and I encourage this body’s support of that important work. I begin by thanking Chairman B
AR-
RASSO , Ranking Member C ARPER , and Senator I
NHOFE for their great work on this bill. On the Environment and Pub-lic Works Committee, we have the leadership of Senator B
ARRASSO and Senator C
ARPER , and on the sub-committee that deals with infrastruc-ture, I work with Senator I
NHOFE . The four of us have worked very closely in, I think, the best traditions of the Envi-ronment and Public Works Committee in the U.S. Senate in order to bring for-ward legislation that really does rep-resent the priorities of all 100 Members of the U.S. Senate. From the beginning, I acknowledge the amount of work that was done in order to accomplish this. It was done in great measure by incredibly gifted staff people who have been working for a long period of time in order to bring this bill to completion. Obviously, there are rough edges, and there are problems that require a lot of negotia-tions. Yet I know that Senator BAR-
RASSO , Senator C ARPER , and Senator I
NHOFE will agree with me about the importance of our staffs’ work. I acknowledge Mae Stevens of my staff for the work she has done on this legislation to advance the priorities that are important for the people of Maryland and to make sure we have a well-balanced bill for our country. As I think my colleagues know, the focal point of my environmental work has been to restore and protect the Chesapeake Bay, which is considered to be one of America’s greatest natural resources and is a national treasure. The Chesapeake Bay is the Nation’s largest estuary. It generates $1 trillion in economic benefit to the watershed region. The Chesapeake Bay is criti-cally important with regard to who we are as a region, our quality of life, our economy, and because of its rich envi-ronmental treasures. The shoreline of the Chesapeake Bay and its tidal tributaries stretch over 2,000 miles. More than 100,000 streams and rivers and thousands of acres of wetlands provide the freshwater that flows into the Chesapeake Bay. If we do not protect the health of this incred-ible network of waters, we cannot hope to restore the Chesapeake Bay to its former glory. Additionally, the effort to clean up and restore the bay creates new jobs and economic growth opportunities around the bay States. For example, work to repair and upgrade our urban and suburban wastewater and stormwater systems puts people to work as engineers and operators, and there are so many more jobs that are created. Although we are making great strides in improving the quality of the Chesapeake Bay—I am very pleased of the progress we have made, and I think you see that when you visit the Inner Harbor of Baltimore or our shorelines— we still have a long way to go. America’s Water Infrastructure Act of 2018 supports the health of the Chesapeake Bay. In doing so, it helps our Nation’s economic competitive-ness, our environment, and the health and welfare of our citizens. In par-ticular, I am pleased that America’s Water Infrastructure Act of 2018 will help both Poplar Island and the Mid- Bay project to continue what is a win- win for both the Baltimore Harbor and the Chesapeake Bay. Both of these projects are located in the State of Maryland. Both are critically impor-tant for us to maintain the environ-ment and economy of the Chesapeake Bay.

I have seen firsthand the results of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ ef-forts around the State. The Corps’ in-genuity and expertise have spearheaded the replenishing and expansion of Pop-lar Island in the Chesapeake Bay. This massive sustainability project is quite literally bringing life to our region in its restoration of a habitat which for years suffered from erosion and envi-ronmental degradation. We are taking Poplar Island, which used to exist in the Chesapeake Bay but had been down to just a few acres, and restoring it in an environmental restoration project. We are bringing back wildlife and species diversifica-tion into the Chesapeake Bay. At the same time, it is a location for dredged materials. I can tell you, in my having been in Congress, it is not always easy to find locations to put dredged mate-rials. Poplar Island is also popular with the community, so it has been a win- win-win situation. The expansion of the island now to 1,715 acres has the long-term benefit of creating a place for our native plants and animals to thrive and the short- term benefit of efficiently utilizing dredged materials from the mainte-nance of the Port of Baltimore to re-build the island beyond its original footprint. We are now back up to over 1,700 acres from just the few acres that existed not too many years ago. This creates a system that helps to improve the vitality of both our treasured eco-system and our commercial waterways, and it sets a precedent for beneficial practices in the future. The Army Corps has collaborated with Federal and State agencies, local communities, and businesses for input on this project, ensuring that its bene-fits will extend to all within the re-gion. The Mid-Bay Project is a continu-ation of the very successful Poplar Is-land project, and I am pleased that both projects are supported in this bill. Poplar Island will reach its capacity in the next few years, which is what we planned on. Yet, in order to make sure we have another site that is available, we have to move that project now so that the planning process can be com-pleted in time and engineering work can be completed in time so that there is no loss of activity in keeping the harbors at the needed dredge levels for shipping and have a site where the dredged material can be located. That is why it is so critically important to move forward with Mid-Bay now. We need policies that will keep up with the demand of our infrastructure backlog while we address the needs of our communities and our environment. We can and we must do both. I am pleased that America’s Water Infra-structure Act of 2018 would help projects in the Anacostia River water-shed in Prince George’s County get off the ground. This is the third WRDA bill in a row. Congress is including updates to our Nation’s drinking water, wastewater, and stormwater infrastructure, includ-ing much needed funding. The American Society of Civil Engi-neers has yet again given our drinking water and wastewater a grade of D for 2016. States will need $32.75 billion a year every year for the next 20 years just to get our infrastructure in work-ing order, which is more than $1 tril-lion. Yet we are currently only spend-ing about $2 billion per year on both the clean water and drinking water State revolving funds combined. Every community—urban, rural, and subur-ban neighborhoods—has a right to ex-pect that water that comes from its tap is safe to drink and that Congress will do everything within its power to ensure that it happens. Clean water means good jobs and better health throughout Maryland and our Nation. Clean water is not a partisan issue, and I have been proud to work with my colleagues to develop legislation that will benefit our aging water resources and infrastructure. Congress has the responsibility to be a strong partner with States and localities to repair our Nation’s hidden water infrastructure and open waterways and to always re-main unwavering in our commitment to improve the Chesapeake Bay water-shed. One of the problems is that a lot of our water infrastructure is hidden. You don’t see it, but you sure do notice it if you don’t get clean water to drink, and you sure notice it when it affects the water quality of the bay or of other critical waters in this country. We really need to pay attention to this. We need to increase our capacity to be a partner in modernizing our water infra-structure, and this legislation abso-lutely takes a major step forward in carrying out that commitment. Let me talk about some of the spe-cific provisions that are included in this act. First, the bill includes S. 1137, the Clean Safe Reliable Water Infrastruc-ture Act, which was introduced by me and Senators B
OOZMAN , INHOFE , and D
UCKWORTH . It addresses the need to invest in our Nation’s drinking water, sewer, and stormwater systems, and it provides for increased water efficiency. The Clean Safe Reliable Water Infra-structure Act specifically includes $450 million to protect the sources of our drinking water and the funding to re-pair and eliminate combined sewer overflows, which dump water sewage into our Nation’s waterways every time it rains. This is especially timely as the Mid-Atlantic region has seen historic precipitation events increas-ingly in the last decade. These 100- or 1,000-year events cause wastewater treatment plants to take on more water than they can handle. Millions of gallons of untreated water are diverted into our local waterways—the same water that supplies our drinking water and the fish, crabs, and oysters that Marylanders love to eat. In fact, there was a storm so massive in Frederick, MD, just a few months ago that city officials asked residents to stop using the water in order to pre-vent equipment failure at the waste-water treatment plant. This is a crisis situation. This $450 million will go far toward helping to divert stormwater away from the wastewater treatment plant in Frederick as well as those like it all over the State of Maryland and our Nation. The Clean Safe Reliable Water Infra-structure Act also formally authorizes the voluntary WaterSense Program, which identifies and promotes water- efficient products through voluntary labeling. The WaterSense label makes it simple to find water-efficient prod-ucts, new homes, and programs that meet the EPA’s criteria for efficiency and performance. WaterSense-labeled products and services are certified to use at least 20-percent less water, save energy, and perform as well as or bet-ter than regular models. The program should help individuals reduce their water demand while protecting water quality. This benefits all of us, as we save water, we save energy, and we save costs. The EPA’s WaterSense Program partners with manufacturers, retailers, distributors, home builders, irrigation professionals, and utilities to bring ef-ficient products and services to our communities, and their partnerships encourage innovation in manufac-turing and support sustainable jobs for American workers. Secondly, the WRDA bill creates a multi-agency Federal task force to study the problem of funding and fi-nancing stormwater infrastructure. The task force will, with the feedback from State and local governments and other program stakeholders, provide in a report to Congress suggestions for improving the funding and financing of stormwater systems—especially impor-tant as Maryland sees more frequent and severe storms, like the deadly floods in Ellicott City that were 22 months apart. I have already spoken on the Senate floor about what happened in Ellicott City, MD. Within 20 months, we had two 1,000-year floods. These floods were unprecedented. What do I mean by that? We have had flooding in Ellicott City before because the water rises in the river that goes through Ellicott City. These are the first floods we have had as a result of the stormwater run-off that literally ran down the main streets of Ellicott City. It destroyed homes and cost people their lives. We need to deal with this. Stormwater pollution is not only an urgent and deadly threat but a long- term one as well. Stormwater pollution is the fastest growing source of pollu-tion in the Chesapeake Bay. Yes, we talk about our farmers, and we have to do better for our farmers. We talk about the other problems we have, in-cluding the airborne pollutants that go into the Bay. But the fastest growing source in the Chesapeake Bay is storm runoff, which is a result of more people

living in the community, a result of more concrete, and a result of more se-vere weather events. Third, the bill addresses the need for information about onsite wastewater recycling as one alternative for com-munities that cannot afford the up-front costs or ongoing maintenance costs of traditional wastewater infra-structure. This is especially important in the rural parts of my State, like Maryland’s Eastern Shore. Fourth, the bill includes S. 451, the Water Resources Research Amend-ments Act, introduced by me and Sen-ator B
OOZMAN , which addresses the need for additional research into in-creasing the effectiveness and effi-ciency of new and existing water treat-ment works. Funding from this pro-gram helps to support the Maryland Water Resources Research Center and the Department of Civil and Environ-mental Engineering at the University of Maryland, College Park. We want to add the latest technology. We want to be the best in the world, as far as tech-nology, when dealing with our water. This particular provision in the bill will help us achieve those objectives. Fifth, the bill reauthorizes WIFIA, a low-cost financing mechanism for water infrastructure projects. We first started with WIFIA in our transpor-tation bill, coming out of our Environ-ment and Public Works Committee, where we found creative ways in order to leverage the Federal participation so we can have larger infrastructure projects for roads, transit, and bridges. Now we are doing the same with water infrastructure. This bill reauthorizes the WIFIA program. Baltimore is on the list to receive one of the very first low-interest WIFIA loans. Baltimore’s $200 million loan will complete a set of projects to repair, rehabilitate, replace, and up-grade its wastewater collection and treatment, water treatment and dis-tribution, and storm water manage-ment systems. These projects will help to improve the city’s sanitary sewer collection system, ensure the reliability and per-formance of the drinking water and wastewater systems, and improve storm water management to meet Clean Water Act permit requirements. This will help the 1.8 million people served by the Baltimore Department of Public Works to continue to have some of the cleanest, safest, and most reli-able drinking water in the country. There is no more fundamental respon-sibility of government than to make sure they provide safe drinking water to its population. Sixth, this bill creates the Water In-frastructure Resiliency and Sustain-ability Program, from a bill that I have long championed to help drinking water plants combat the effects of cli-mate change. This program will award grants to increase the resiliency and adaptability of water systems to in-creasingly severe storms and droughts, as well as sea level rise—all caused by climate change. Water utilities can use the grants to assist in the planning, design, con-struction, implementation, operation, or maintenance of the plant—really, anything they need to increase their climate preparedness. I applaud the great work that has been accomplished through this legis-lation, and I look forward to con-tinuing the work to advance water in-frastructure investment, including in-tegrated planning and affordability. From the very beginning, I said that this was a bill that was done in the right process in the Senate. Input was solicited from every Member of the Senate. The committee reached out to all of the Members. All the members of our committee have had input into this legislation. It is bipartisan. It is fis-cally responsible, which was a key re-quirement of the bill. It will benefit of our communities. It will help us to meet our fundamental commitment to provide the citizens of this Nation with clean and safe drink-ing water. It will deal with the chal-lenges we have in storm runoff, as it deals with environmental challenges we have. It is a well-balanced bill. Once again, I applaud the leadership of Senators B
ARRASSO and C ARPER and my colleague on the subcommittee, Senator I
NHOFE , for their tremendous work. I look forward to voting for this bill, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Iowa. 
CONFIRMATION OF BRETT KAVANAUGH  
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak on two dif-ferent subjects. The most important one is the first one: to thank a lot of people who helped me to chair and oversee the confirmation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh. I should have given this speech 72 hours ago, but I was in a hurry to get to the airport. So I am making up for lost time now. As everyone knows, on Saturday the Senate confirmed Judge Brett Kavanaugh as our newest Associate Justice on the U.S. Supreme Court. I come to the floor to thank the Senate staff who helped to make that con-firmation possible. Senators don’t always recognize their staff as much as we probably should, but I am proud of the work my staff ac-complished over the last 3 months as we considered the nomination of Kavanaugh. They have worked very diligently on this confirmation process of our new Justice, and most of it was behind the scenes. They put in the long, long work hours required, and they did it 7 days a week, if needed. The chairman’s team tackled the heavy workload before them, and I am tremendously grateful for all they did to make this nomination a success. First, on my staff, I would like to recognize my Judiciary counsel staff director, Kolan Davis. Kolan’s experi-ence and sound judgment keeps me out of a lot of trouble. I value his counsel today, just as I have for the last 33 years that he has been on my staff. By my side right here today is Mike Davis, the Judiciary Committee’s chief counsel for nominations and also an Iowan. He graduated from the Univer-sity of Iowa and Iowa Law. Mike brought the tenacity, diligence, and ev-erything else that was needed to lead Kavanaugh’s confirmation. The permanent nomination unit for the Senate Judiciary Committee, working with Mike Davis, includes Lauren Mehler, Steve Kenny, Kath-arine Willey, and Jessica Vu. Each of them worked incredibly hard. They have worked hard on all nominations of lifetime appointments to the Fed-eral judiciary and over a long period of time, not just on Kavanaugh. Their hard work is shown by the record num-ber of judges the Senate has confirmed this Congress. I think the number is 67 so far, besides 2 Supreme Court Jus-tices. I believe there are 41 on the cal-endar right now. In addition to this team, Andrew Fer-guson joined my staff to lead the team of special counsels to specifically assist with the Supreme Court nomination. Andrew led by example with his tire-less work ethic and, of course, his legal talent. I also want to thank special counsels Tyler Badgley, Lucas Croslow, Colleen Ernst, Megan McGlynn, and Collin White. This team read every word of Justice Kavanaugh’s more than 500,000 pages from his time as an executive branch lawyer, the 307 opinions he au-thored on the DC Circuit Court, and all other documents relevant to his nomi-nation. Rachel Mitchell was part of this spe-cial counsel team, offering her exper-tise and many years of experience at a time when we needed extra help when we had Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh before our committee for a second set of hearings. Law clerks Tim Rodriguez, Camille Peeples, Abby Hollenstein, Dario Camacho, Elizabeth Donald, Michael Talent, Bob Minchin, Nathan Williams, Sam Adkisson, and Asher Perez had the opportunity to contribute and learn during this nomination. I thank them for their hard work and service here in the Senate, on top of their rig-orous education. I thank the intern Jacob Ramer for his contribution as well. Justice Kavanaugh’s confirmation process resulted in a record number of pages available to Senators, including questions for the record. This team handled it all. Over the course of my Senate service, I have established a reputation for my oversight work. I am equipped with a permanent staff of experienced inves-tigators. When allegations of sexual as-sault were brought to my attention on September 13, I was fortunate to have this experienced and highly regarded division of my staff already on the job

to help run down every question and al-legation we received. I thank DeLisa Lay, Patrick Davis, Josh Flynn-Brown, Katherine Nikas, Daniel Parker, and executive branch detailee Andy Hromyak for their dedi-cation to investigation, oversight, and accountability. I also want to thank my talented communications team: Judiciary Com-mittee communications director Tay-lor Foy and Judiciary Committee press secretary George Hartmann, as well as Michael Zona, Nicole Tieman, and Alexa Den Herder for their hard work. October 6 will be a memorable date for Taylor, marking both his wedding an-niversary and the day Justice Kavanaugh was confirmed. I am thankful for my personal office staff, led by my chief of staff, Jill Kozeny. She has been on my staff for 31 years. I have long appreciated Jill’s ad-vice and all of her hard work on my be-half. I am also grateful for Jennifer Heins, who makes a tremendous contribution every day, and every staffer who was part of this confirmation process, in-cluding Penne Barton, Zach Schultz, Katelyn Schultz, Josie Wagler, and my State staff, who had to answer a lot of telephone calls over a period of 3 months, just dealing with people for and against the nomination of Justice Kavanaugh. I very much appreciate the rest of my Judiciary Committee staff, includ-ing my deputy staff director, Rita Lari, who took care of things while I was on the floor and during the long hours in the hearing. Finally, I appreciate the work of Leader M
CCONNELL ’s staff, most impor-tantly, John Abegg. 
RELIGIOUS FREEDOM IN CHINA AND TAIWAN  
Mr. President, tomorrow, October 10, is the 107th national day of the Repub-lic of China on Taiwan. I would like to extend my congratu-lations to the people of Taiwan on this very important occasion and to express my appreciation for the U.S.-Taiwan relations. We were allies in World War II and have been close strategic and economic partners for a very long time. However, as the Government of the Re-public of China on Taiwan has evolved into a thriving free-market democracy that is today, our relationship has even deepened and strengthened in a way that can only happen when two coun-tries share core values. There are times when the economic or geopolitical interests of the United States are aligned with those of an-other country that does not fully em-brace freedom as we do—whether that freedom is in the marketplace of goods and services or the marketplace of ideas in a democratic context. We can and should seek to engage with coun-tries that do not share our values where it is in our national interest, and we do that. Still, those relationships remain con-tingent on weighing economic and se-curity costs and benefits. On the other hand, with free-market democracies like Taiwan, there is at the heart of our relationship a very high degree of mutual understanding underpinning all of our interactions. Our shared values mean that our long-term economic and strategic interests are likely to remain aligned. For instance, market econo-mies are more likely to seek mutually beneficial free and fair trade. Democ-racies tend not to seek hegemony but cooperation. In short, our shared val-ues provide the basis for an enduring and stable bond that can only exist be-tween free people. One of those fundamental values that is dear to my heart is religious free-dom. I know my colleagues are aware of the disturbing reports out of the People’s Republic of China about the closing and destruction of churches and the burning of Bibles. That is some-thing we in the United States just do not understand how anybody, any country, could take this situation and think: Who is afraid of worshiping God? Well, it seems they have some problem in China. In Xinjiang Province, the Chinese Government has rounded up over 1 mil-lion Uighurs and Kazakh Muslims. Ti-betan Buddhists and practitioners of Falun Gong have also long had their freedom to practice their beliefs sup-pressed. This should disturb all free people. Of course, the Communist leaders of China have excuses for their behavior. One of these is the need for sinicization of nonnative religions. In other words, they think religions like Christianity as freely practiced are somehow not compatible with Chinese society. Of course, from our point of view, that is strictly nuts. Just look at Taiwan. It has the same Chinese history, the same Chinese lan-guage, the same Chinese culture as mainland China. Yet, on Taiwan, Chris-tians and other religious groups prac-tice their faith freely. No one gives even a second thought to whether this is compatible with their history and tradition because it is a matter of con-science, not a matter of undercutting the government. That is why I don’t understand why it is a problem for Bei-jing. In fact, Taiwan has arguably pre-served traditional Chinese cultures better than on the mainland. Chiang Kai-shek was able to rescue and bring to Taiwan some of the most valuable treasures from Chinese history. Of course, these items in Taiwanese soci-ety, in general, were spared the horrors of the cultural revolution. Of course, the cultural revolution was when the Communist Party of China destroyed an untold number of historical arti-facts as well as cultural and religious sites. Ancient Chinese texts were burned, and there were massive human rights abuses. Some have suggested that recent de-velopments in China are the beginning of a new sort of cultural revolution. I hope not because we know what the re-sults of that were 50 or 60 years ago. Whatever the Communist Chinese Government is thinking, its actions have shattered many illusions. The hope held by many in the United States was that robust engagement with the People’s Republic of China on an economic and political level would help it to evolve into a free market de-mocracy. That hope has now dimmed significantly. Things seem to be going quite in the opposite direction. This is a bad sign, then, for U.S.- China relations. If the Chinese leaders would like to correct their current course and improve relations with the United States, just take the example of Taiwan. Just look across the Taiwan Strait for that model: Chinese people, just like they are in Beijing. As the people of Taiwan celebrate their national day, I would like to thank them for their friendship with our great country. The Republic of China on Taiwan continues to be a strong partner in trade, security, and human rights. In fact, I should note that a delegation from Taiwan recently visited my home State of Iowa to in-crease their purchases of soybeans, and I greatly appreciate that, along with 88,000 Iowa farmers. Finally, I would like to thank Tai-wan for being a model of a free and democratic society when it can have a mutually beneficial partnership with the United States. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Montana. HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS  
Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I rise on behalf of 152,000 of my constituents in Montana with preexisting conditions. These are folks who are struggling with things like diabetes and heart dis-ease and asthma and cancer. Many of them are just one medical bill away from bankruptcy. Thankfully, their health insurance is there for them when they need it, whether it be for a joint replacement or to undergo chemo or to have a baby. Federal law holds health insurance companies accountable that their plans cover us when we need it. Unfortu-nately, those rules are being tossed out so big insurance can make a quick buck at the expense of working fami-lies. Just last week, health insurance companies started flooding the market with junk plans. These plans are mar-keted as cheap insurance that will keep you healthy. Fifty bucks a month for full coverage, they say; $8.95 a week for top-rated coverage, they claim. Now, that is a heck of a deal. Well, not so fast. They are total and complete shams. If you read the fine print, you will discover that dialysis, blood pressure pills, and x rays aren’t covered. In fact, most things are not covered. Originally, insurance companies de-signed these plans to provide stopgap coverage when you changed jobs or needed health insurance for just a few months. They figured you could get by

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES6714 October 9, 2018 
with a bare-bones policy for a month or two. They were never designed to pro-vide coverage for an entire year, let alone three, but now that has all changed. Starting last week, health insurance companies now have permission to sell long-term junk plans to Montana’s families. What was once a short-term solution is now becoming a long-term problem. So let’s ask ourselves why we buy in-surance in the first place. It is for risk management. Why do we buy auto in-surance? It is in case you get in an auto wreck. You hope you never have to use it, but if you do, you need that insurance to take care of that auto-mobile to get it back on the road again. Why do we buy fire insurance? In case you have a fire. You hope it never ever happens, but every once in a while it does, and if you are unfortunate and it happens to you, you have fire insur-ance to rebuild your home. I am a farmer. Why do you have crop insurance? You have crop insurance in that case where Mother Nature may not be smiling upon you; you may not get the rain at the appropriate time or you may get a hailstorm that wipes you out. You hope it never happens, but if it does, you have that crop insur-ance you can depend upon to manage your risk. So why do you buy health insurance? Is it because you plan on getting sick? I don’t think so. It is because, if you get sick, you will need the coverage. If you end up with high blood pressure, you have the coverage to help offset those costs. Unfortunately, with these junk plans, they are called junk for a rea-son—because they don’t cover any-thing. They give you a false sense of hope and a false sense of coverage and you have no coverage. I want to take you back to 1965. In 1965, my parents bought an accident in-surance policy. It was supposed to cover accidents. Guess what happened in 1965. I got in a little accident with a meat grinder, and that insurance pol-icy covered nothing. My folks had to dig deep and pay for the cost. When they thought they had insurance, they had nothing. I was young, but I can still remember how angry my father was that they had been sold a bill of goods. That is ex-actly what it is with these junk insur-ance plans. Montanans are getting grifted. They are being sold a bill of goods. They are being lied to, deceived, and I will do whatever I can do to keep the junk out of our healthcare. We must hold big insurance compa-nies accountable. We cannot let cor-porations swindle folks who need health insurance when, in the end, they have nothing. The bill before us this week does that. It keeps short-term plans short term. It stops insurance companies from selling garbage plans that don’t cover preexisting conditions. That is why I am urging my col-leagues to vote for this resolution, to stand up for Montanans across the State and Americans across this coun-try. These are folks who work hard to put food on the table, and they shouldn’t have to choose between a doctor’s appointment and a utility bill. Today I rise for those folks from Miles City, Harlowton, and Libby and promise to defend them from these shoddy plans. With that, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. 
S. 3021 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, in a few minutes, hopefully, the Senate will vote to invoke cloture on the motion to concur on the America’s Water In-frastructure Act of 2018. In preparing to take this vote, I want to remind our colleagues why this bill is so important not just for our country’s economy but for our environment as well. The Senator from Wyoming, Mr. B
ARRASSO , will mention shortly that this is a comprehensive bill that sup-ports the Army Corps of Engineers. It supports EPA’s drinking water and wastewater programs. It authorizes the Corps to construct, modify, study, and expedite more than 100 water resource development projects. It prepares our country’s water infrastructure for ex-treme weather events to avoid devasta-tion caused by storms like Hurricane Florence by reauthorizing levee and dam safety programs through 2023. It also establishes programs to make communities more resistant to sea level rise. It reauthorizes, for the first time in 22 years, the Drinking Water State Revolving Loan Fund, which pro-vides for needed investments in water and sanitation infrastructure all across our country. This bill would also nearly double the size of this critical loan program from $1 billion to almost $2 billion by 2021. It expands the existing $60 million annual small and disadvantaged communities program to allow for the testing and treatment of contamination in drink-ing water systems. It provides schools with the resources needed to address lead contamination. This bipartisan bill is a major win for families across the country. It passed both the Senate Environment and Pub-lic Works Committee and the House unanimously, and I urge my colleagues in the Senate to vote yes on this clo-ture motion. Before I yield, I just want to say to my friend Senator B
ARRASSO how proud I have been to work with him. Our staffs are really a model of the way this place should work. We worked well not only with our colleagues on our committee and outside of our com-mittee but also with the folks over in the House of Representatives. I will talk about them later today. To my chairman, it is a real pleasure to work with you on this one. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Wyoming. Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to complete my brief remarks before the rollcall vote. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, first I wish to thank my colleague and friend from Delaware, Senator CARPER , for his friendship, leadership, and advo-cacy on this important piece of legisla-tion. We worked closely together. I rise in support of S. 2031, America’s Water Infrastructure Act of 2018. Every day, Americans depend on our Nation’s water infrastructure systems. Clean water, flood control structures, working irrigation systems are all nec-essary for health, safety, and pros-perity for our communities. This legislation is going to authorize important water projects. It will main-tain the navigability of inland water-ways and coastal ports, increase water storage, and fix aging irrigation sys-tems across the country. It will create jobs. It will spur eco-nomic growth and give local leaders an increased say in the projects and the way the projects are prioritized. It will rebuild flood control systems. This is the most significant drinking water legislation in decades. America’s Water Infrastructure Act will cut Washington redtape; it will help grow the economy; and it will keep commu-nities safe. The legislation is good for all 50 States. It is bipartisan. It is bicameral. The legislation passed the Environ-ment and Public Works Committee by a vote of 21 to 0. It passed the House by unanimous consent on a voice vote. It has the support of a broad array of stakeholders, from the American Farm Bureau to the U.S. Chamber of Com-merce, to the National Association of Manufacturers, to the Family Farm Al-liance. As a testament to just how broad the support is for this bill, both the American Petroleum Institute and the Sierra Club have endorsed its pas-sage. We don’t see that every day. It is time to pass this important leg-islation and send it to President Trump for his signature. I encourage all Sen-ators to support cloture on this bill. I yield the floor.

The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the motion to concur in the House amendments to S. 3021, an act to designate the United States courthouse located at 300 South Fourth Street in Minneapolis, Min-nesota, as the ‘‘Diana E. Murphy United States Courthouse,’’ shall be brought to a close? The yeas are mandatory under the rule. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. B

The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. R
UBIO). On this vote, the yeas are 96, the nays are 3. Three-fifths of the Senators having voted in the affirmative, the motion is agreed to. Cloture having been in-voked, the motion to refer amendments pending thereto fall. The Senator from Wyoming. Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, water infrastructure, a bill that we have just moved to a positive cloture vote, 96 to 3—water infrastructure is important to every State, as we see by this vote—every territory, every com-munity, and every Tribe in this coun-try. These systems support America’s economic growth and our competitive-ness. They deliver drinking water and treat wastewater. They provide water for crops, cattle, and small businesses. They are used to ship American-made goods from the heartland to the coasts and around the world. They keep homes safe from dangerous flood waters; they store water for times of drought. These systems are vital to our coun-try. We must maintain, upgrade, and, where necessary, build them. During the State of the Union Ad-dress this year, President Trump called on Congress to act on infrastructure. He said we will build America’s infra-structure ‘‘with American heart, Amer-ican hands, and American grit.’’ Water infrastructure is a major part of the President’s call. That is why I introduced America’s Water Infrastruc-ture Act, along with my fellow leaders of the Environment and Public Works Committee, Senators CARPER , INHOFE , and C
ARDIN . Several other committee members were also cosponsors, includ-ing Senators C
APITO , WICKER , VANHOL-
LEN, BOOZMAN , WHITEHOUSE , and S UL-
LIVAN . Politico called America’s Water In-frastructure Act the most significant infrastructure legislation to be taken up under the Trump administration so far. This legislation passed the Envi-ronment and Public Works Committee in the Senate unanimously, 21 to 0. Last month, the same leaders from our committee and the leadership of the committees in the House of Rep-resentatives reached a deal on historic comprehensive water infrastructure legislation. America’s Water Infra-structure Act now has broad bicameral and bipartisan support. Our bill will help grow the economy, will cut Washington redtape, and will keep communities safe. Authorizing important water projects will create jobs that will spur economic growth. The legislation will help deepen nationally significant ports and maintain the navigability of inland waterways. It is going to in-crease storage in the West and build new flood management infrastructure. This bill will fix aging dams and irri-gation systems across the country. Up-grading these systems will ensure that ranchers and farmers will get the water that they rely on. It will also help communities recover from devastating storms like Hurri-cane Florence and the damage it left along the east coast, especially in North and South Carolina. America’s Water Infrastructure Act also cuts Washington redtape. As chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, I have heard time and again how State and local leaders know better than Wash-ington which projects would have the most positive impact on their commu-nity. Our bill will give local experts an increased role in prioritizing which Army Corps projects get built. When a local partner takes over an Army Corps of Engineer’s flood control project, they will no longer need to worry about obtaining brandnew per-mits. The Army Corps will simply transfer its authority to the local part-ner so that new permits are no longer necessary. The government will also provide technical assistance to smaller com-munities to make it simpler for them to comply with environmental laws. Leveraging Federal dollars is an im-portant element of President Trump’s infrastructure plan. We included lan-guage to help smaller rural commu-nities leverage their resources so that they can build water infrastructure projects. Federal leveraging programs, particularly the Water Infrastructure Flexibility Act, allow taxpayers to get the most bang for their buck. In the past, smaller rural commu-nities have had trouble accessing these dollars. The language in our consensus bill will give these rural communities the chance to compete for these funds and the ability to participate in these successful programs. Cutting redtape and increasing ac-cess to these leveraging programs will help us get projects done faster, better, cheaper, and smarter. That is just com-mon sense. America’s Water Infrastructure Act is also about safety. In recent years, we have seen the damage that floods and droughts can cause. We must maintain and improve our dams, our beach fronts, our levies, and our reservoirs. Our bill takes steps to address the backlog of maintenance needs of these infrastructure systems. It also creates a permanent program to find solutions for floods caused by ice jams. In the spring, and certainly in Wyo-ming, thawing ice and snow create jams in rivers and can cause them to overflow their banks. In my home State of Wyoming, ice jam floods have been devastating for the towns of Greybull and Worland. America’s Water Infrastructure Act authorizes important programs to find permanent ways to prevent these types of floods. This bill is about more than just flood prevention. It is the most signifi-cant drinking water legislation in dec-ades. The bill authorizes funds to re-pair aging drinking water systems. For the first time since 1996—that is 22 years ago—Congress will be author-izing the Drinking Water State Revolv-ing Funds. These funds give States cer-tainty—certainty that they can meet their drinking water needs. That is a big deal. There is a line that people say in Wy-oming. It was originally attributed to Mark Twain. The line is this: Whiskey is for drinking; water is for fighting over. That is not the case with Amer-ica’s Water Infrastructure Act.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES6716 October 9, 2018 
That is not the case with America’s Water Infrastructure Act. Democrats and Republicans are working together in a bipartisan way. The House of Rep-resentatives and the Senate are work-ing together in a bicameral way. The House of Representatives passed this consensus bill unanimously by voice vote. Now it is the Senate’s turn. We all know how important this legisla-tion is for our country, for our States, and for our constituents. The bill is bi-partisan and is fiscally responsible. America’s Water Infrastructure Act ac-tually reduces the deficit. I thank Ranking Member C
ARPER and Subcommittee Chairman I
NHOFE and Subcommittee Ranking Member C
ARDIN and their staffs for their leader-ship in working through this process. They have been wonderful partners in writing legislation that will have a real impact all across America. This bill is for all of America. It will have a real impact in our rural areas and in our big cities. It will help communities in the heartland and communities on the coasts. It is now time to pass this legisla-tion. Let’s pass the American Water In-frastructure Act and send it to Presi-dent Trump for his signature. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. D
AINES ). The Senator from Delaware. Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise today, along with the chairman, Sen-ator B
ARRASSO , to further discuss the important piece of infrastructure legis-lation that he has outlined that will positively affect the States of every Member of this body. I want to encour-age each of our colleagues to support it. Over the course of August and early September, the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee reached an agreement with our counterparts in the House to advance America’s Water Infrastructure Act of 2018. Our chairman, J
OHNBARRASSO , and I coauthored this bill and did so with the help of the majority and minority staffs of the Environment and Public Works Committee over the better part of this past year. I want to take a mo-ment to thank our chairman, as I have earlier, for his leadership. I want to thank the chairman and ranking mem-ber of the Infrastructure Sub-committee of EPW, J
IMINHOFE and B
ENCARDIN , for their leadership in pro-ducing this critical bipartisan legisla-tion. I want to thank the members of their staffs and especially the majority and minority member EPW staffs, without whose help this bill would not be before us today. Collectively, you have done a terrific job. I am proud of you. As we say in the Navy, Bravo Zulu, which means ‘‘well done.’’ As some of you may recall, the Sen-ate’s version of the bill was reported out of the Environment and Public Works Committee unanimously a few months back. On September 13, the bill passed the House of Representatives unanimously on a voice vote. People back home say to me: Why can’t you just work together? Well, in this case, we have, and I think the re-sults speak for themselves. I am hope-ful and encouraged that this bill will receive the same strong support in the Senate this week. In a Congress and a country that are all too often divided, it is refreshing to me and I think to others as well that we have been able to come together to authorize water infrastructure and drinking water programs that are both vital and critical to the American peo-ple’s way of life. America’s Water Infrastructure Act of 2018 is a win-win for our Nation’s economy and for our environment. This bill should serve as a model for how we can get meaningful legislation done in Congress, and I hope it will serve as a model. This legislation supports the ongoing work of the U.S. Army Corps of Engi-neers. It does so by reauthorizing the Corps’ program for flood control, for beach and shoreline maintenance, and for the maintenance of inland and coastal waterways through which the goods that enter and depart from American ports travel. The Corps’ Civil Works Program is our Nation’s largest and I believe the world’s biggest water resources under-taking. This program addresses a wide variety of priorities, including ship navigability; flood risk management; beach and shoreline protection; renew-able energy, such as hydropower; water supply; and environmental restoration and stewardship. In fact, over 99 per-cent of U.S. overseas trade moves through the waterways which the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is responsible for maintaining. Think of that—99 per-cent. In fact, this bill supports the Corps’ operation and maintenance of 13,000 miles of commercial deep-draft ship channels and 12,000 miles of commer-cial inland waterways. These ports and waterways serve a combined 40 States and transport much of our country’s waterborne cargo. The new authorizations that this bill provides are critically needed. Much of the infrastructure that the Corps is re-sponsible for across the country now exceeds its useful lifespan. As a result, we have an enormous construction backlog of needed infrastructure in-vestments. The latest estimates from the Army Corps indicate that the over-all construction backlog is in the neighborhood of $96 billion, while the annual budget of the Army Corps hov-ers around $4.6 billion. Think of that— $96 billion on the one hand and $4.6 bil-lion on the other hand. Those two num-bers reflect the extraordinary chal-lenge the Army Corps faces—a chal-lenge we begin to address with this leg-islation. This bill addresses that back-log by providing new tools that will allow the government to partner with the Corps and leverage existing re-sources to make sure we get the most bang for our buck. This legislation also increases local participation, transparency, and ac-countability in developing the Army Corps’ annual budget. It is my hope that enhanced local participation will allow for a more transparent and long- term look at the Corps’ activities and help build a greater groundswell of sup-port for increased appropriations to fund the agency’s initiatives. The measure before us also author-izes critical Corps of Engineers disaster programs. When disaster strikes, the Federal Government often steps in and helps, as it did last year in Puerto Rico, Florida, Louisiana, Texas, and this year in the Carolinas. A large part of that help is provided by the Army Corps of Engineers—something that may come as a surprise to Americans who don’t realize the critical role the Corps plays in responding to all sorts of emergencies. In addition, this bill includes new au-thorities to help protect communities and ecosystems in coastal States like Delaware and Maryland and States across our country from some of the worst impacts of extreme weather events. This measure includes provi-sions that allow communities to re-cover more quickly, too, when disaster does strike and facilitates rebuilding facilities in ways that are more resil-ient to future storms. This legislation also makes key changes in emergency response, post- disaster recovery, and resiliency efforts so that the Army Corps thinks long- term instead of short-term when it se-lects solutions that it will implement. But the bill goes even further. It en-ables the Corps to pursue the best pos-sible solutions to make communities more resistant to storm damage, whether those solutions are a tradi-tionally constructed levee or a natural alternative, like the reconstructed dunes we are using along the Delaware coast and other places too. Earlier this year, NOAA announced that the total cost for extreme weather and climate events in 2017 exceeded $300 billion. That is a new U.S. annual record—$300 billion in 1 year, last year. It is not a matter of if the next ex-treme weather event is coming, it is a matter of when. As storm events, such as Hurricane Florence, grow more pow-erful and prevalent, threatening Amer-ican lives and infrastructure, the pas-sage of this bill—a bill that will help protect coastal communities from the risk of flooding—has never been more important. In addition to strengthening key Corps programs, this bill also addresses key programs at EPA for major drink-ing water and wastewater needs across our country. For the first time in over 20 years, this bill reauthorizes the Drinking Water State Revolving Loan Fund, too. That program provides Fed-eral assistance to help communities with clean drinking water. It does so through no-interest, low-interest, and

forgivable loans that help communities in a variety of ways gain access to cap-ital that would otherwise be unavail-able. It is my hope that one day we can eventually add grants back into this program for communities that need the help the most, but that is probably a longer conversation somewhere down the line. The ongoing crisis in Flint that we are now seeing play out in far too many communities across our country is tragic but avoidable if we invest in water infrastructure more wisely. This bill makes it clear that we have learned our lesson, and we are begin-ning to take some steps to address this enormous challenge. Some of our colleagues may recall that earlier this year Senator D
UCKWORTH and I hosted a drinking water roundtable here on Capitol Hill. The image of her holding up in her hand a baby bottle with formula made from contaminated drinking water is an image that is hard for me to forget. This bill authorizes more resources for EPA to make sure that every par-ent, no matter what their ZIP Code is, where they live, can be confident that the water coming out of the tap at home or at their children’s school is safe for their kids to drink. Toward that end, this legislation not only re-authorizes the safe drinking water re-volving loan program, it nearly doubles its funding. By fiscal year 2021, the pro-gram will grow from the current au-thorization of $1 billion to almost $2 billion. Perhaps most notably, especially in light of the avoidable devastation and tragedy we saw in the wake of Hurri-canes Maria and Harvey, this bill au-thorizes $100 million to repair drinking water systems damaged by storms and creates a new program that helps pro-tect drinking water systems from ex-treme weather events. This legislation allows States that detect contaminants in drinking water to provide assistance to residents who depend on private water wells. This provision should matter to every Mem-ber of Congress whose residents rely significantly on wells for their water consumption needs, and we have them in every single State across America. I don’t know about other States, but one in six Delawareans depends on private wells for their drinking water. It is not fair that if contaminants end up in their water through no fault of the resident, the resident has to find a way to rectify that situation on their own. Without this bill, these taxpayers get no support, and that is not right. This bill goes way beyond addressing emergency situations. It provides a framework for updating and expanding water infrastructure systems through-out our country at both the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers. As I mentioned earlier, the bill au-thorizes $50 million for technical as-sistance to help schools and daycare centers deal with lead contamination in their drinking water and another $5 million per year in grants for modern-izing, testing, and replacing the lead components that are causing the water contamination. This provision is going to be particularly helpful in places like Chicago and Baltimore, where there are schools operating with no usable drinking water fountains. Oftentimes, our water infrastructure is the forgotten leg of the infrastruc-ture stool. We rightly worry about the infrastructure we can see, such as bridges, highways, airports, and rail-roads, but our water infrastructure— our pipes, shipping channels, flood con-trol structures; the infrastructure we don’t see but rely on every day—is also in desperate need of investment in many parts of America. Before I yield the floor today, I want to again thank our chairman, Senator B
ARRASSO , and our Senators from Maryland and Oklahoma who are the cochairs of the Infrastructure Sub-committee of Environment and Public Works and other members of our com-mittee and frankly those who are not fortunate enough to serve on our com-mittee. I thank them for their hard work throughout this process. I thank our colleagues over in the House—Congressmen Shuster, DeFazio, Walden, and Pallone—who were great partners of ours. When we work to-gether as Democrats and Republicans in both Chambers, we are stronger, and when we are stronger here, we are stronger across our country. Finally, I thank the Assistant Sec-retary of the U.S. Army Corps of Engi-neers, R.D. James, who has made this legislation a priority for the Army Corps and for the administration. He and his team worked with us to craft a bill that I think we can all be proud of, and I am. I want to mention again that as smart as J
OHNBARRASSO and I and the other Senators who serve on our com-mittee and here in the Senate are, this bill wouldn’t be before us if we didn’t have some very smart people on our staffs. One is sitting right here next to me today, and some others are stand-ing behind me. I see over on the Repub-lican majority side some terrific mem-bers of staff who work under the lead-ership of our chairman. I want to take a moment to take my hat off—I wish I were wearing my hat. If I were, I would take it off to all of you, as well. Let me end today with an African proverb that I think is particularly rel-evant. It goes something like this: If you want to go fast, travel alone. If you want to go far, travel together. By working together, we crafted leg-islation that is both substantive and needed. This proposal stands as a time-ly example of how we can set aside our differences and get meaningful work done for the people who sent us here and expected us to accomplish really important things like this on their be-half. The underlying bill before us is one that delivers a lot of good to the Amer-ican people. At the same time, it rep-resents good public policy that is fis-cally responsible. It is deserving of the support of our colleagues in the Sen-ate. I hope they will join us in sup-porting its passage. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Wyoming. Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I would like to sincerely thank my rank-ing member and partner in this bipar-tisan bill, Senator CARPER . You could not have asked for a better colead mov-ing this legislation forward. I agree with exactly the sentiments expressed by the senior Senator from Delaware that America’s Water Infrastructure Act could not have happened without a lot of hard work from a number of dedi-cated legislators, as well as dedicated staff. I also thank the chairman and rank-ing member of our Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee, Chair-man I
NHOFE , Ranking Member C ARDIN , and their staffs for their important contributions and their strong support. As Senator C
ARPER mentioned the House, I thank our colleagues there and partners in this effort, Chairman S
HUSTER and Ranking Member D EFA-
ZIOof the Transportation and Infra-structure Committee; Chairman W
AL-
DEN and Ranking Member P ALLONE of the Energy and Commerce Committee, along with their staff. They did a sig-nificant amount of heavy lifting to get this important water infrastructure bill to the finish line. Finally, I thank the staff of the Envi-ronment and Public Works Committee for their tireless work on the legisla-tion. Senator C
ARPER mentioned them from both sides of the aisle. On my staff, I thank Richard Russell, Brian Clifford, Andrew Harding, Lizzy Olsen, Pauline Thorndike, Craig Thom-as, and Mike Danlak, and my chief of staff, Dan Coonsman. On the minority staff, I thank Mary Frances Repko, John Kane, Andrew Rogers, Christina Baysinger, Skylar Bayer, Ashley Morgan, and Avery Mul-ligan. It would not have happened without all of their hard work, dedica-tion, and commitment to this piece of legislation. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES6718 October 9, 2018 
BALDWIN ’s resolution that would pro-tect the millions of Americans in Wis-consin and Oregon and all across the land who are faced with preexisting health conditions. This has been an area I have focused on since my days as codirector of the Oregon Gray Panthers because pre-existing conditions is kind of fancy lingo that people talk about as it re-lates to healthcare policy, but really what it is all about is, if you have can-cer or diabetes or heart disease or asth-ma or any one of a score of healthcare conditions, before the Affordable Care Act, you were just in a world of hurt, literally and figuratively. In effect, the healthcare system then was for the healthy and the wealthy. If you were healthy, there was nothing to worry about—no preexisting condition. If you were wealthy, you just paid the bills, but if you had preexisting conditions, as millions and millions of Americans have, then you were really out of luck. So then, along came the Affordable Care Act. I had written a piece of legis-lation, the Healthy Americans Act, with seven Democrats and seven Re-publicans as cosponsors. It had air-tight, loophole-free protection for Americans against discrimination if they had preexisting conditions. That provision from the Healthy Americans Act, to a very great extent, made its way into the Affordable Care Act. That is why millions of Americans were able to go to bed at night with a sense of comfort and a sense that if they did have healthcare conditions, the insur-ance companies wouldn’t be able to just clobber them with higher costs. Unfortunately, we have the Trump ad-ministration’s wanting to bring back the days when healthcare was for the healthy and wealthy and allow dis-crimination against people with pre-existing conditions. The flip side of the preexisting condi-tion coin is junk insurance—selling junk insurance that really isn’t worth a whole lot more than the paper it is written on. Boy, do I know something about junk insurance because that is how I started my time in public serv-ice, when senior citizens were sold 15 to 20 policies. Again, the rip-offs were built in. Back then, if you had one pol-icy and you had another policy that of-fered similar coverage, they canceled each other out, and the senior got nothing. It was junk insurance. If we go back to the days when they dis-criminated against people with pre-existing conditions, we are going to have junk insurance all over again. I am going to begin with the Trump administration’s record on this. First of all, if you are a scam artist who is peddling junk plans, the Trump administration has your back. If you are a person with a preexisting condi-tion, the Trump administration is ad-vancing policies that will make both your health and your wallet in far worse shape. Now, the Trump officials get up and talk about the benefits of short-term plans. They will use buzz words like ‘‘flexibility’’ and ‘‘patient- centered care,’’ but I want everybody to be clear that it is junk insurance, plain and simple. It is putting a whole lot of lipstick on a frog. These junk insurance plans the Trump administration has revived rep-resent the very worst of industry tricks and abuses. They punish Ameri-cans who really need healthcare. If you are young, if you are healthy, and if you are wealthy, as I have said, there is nothing to worry about. With junk plans, you have a glide path to put scams on those with preexisting condi-tions like heart disease, cancer, and mental illness. They exist to prey on older Americans—on women, on the less fortunate—particularly a group that I have thought was the heart of where healthcare reform ought to go— to the folks between 55 and 65. As I have indicated, junk plans are not new. Congress and the American people have rejected them before. I mentioned my history with the Oregon Gray Panthers. Big, thick stacks of legalese that nobody could understand were always hyped to the seniors. They were going to fill the gaps in Medicare. It was called Medigap. Back then, it was really just A and B. It didn’t have D and Medicare Advantage and all kinds of other things. It was just A and B. You had seniors frightened that the gaps in Medicare were going to con-sume any savings they might have. So every time a fast-talking salesperson came through, a senior would buy a policy. When I was the director of the Gray Panthers, it was common to go to seniors’ homes, and they would actu-ally go to a closet and pull out a shoebox full of these worthless policies. I really fear we are looking at going back to those days. The fact is that Congress finally cracked down on those Medigap rip- offs. I had an opportunity to be a part of that effort as a Member of the other body, the House, but a lot of people got hurt in the process. Junk insurance was not just a prob-lem for seniors. A few years ago, the Affordable Care Act was designed, as I mentioned, in terms of the Healthy Americans Act, to make sure that junk insurance would be eliminated across the board. Across the board, we would say in our country, we are going to have ironclad, loophole-free guarantees that no American would ever face dis-crimination over a preexisting condi-tion. By the way, that used to be a bipar-tisan proposition. The fact is that still serving in this body are a number of my colleagues on the Republican side who are cosponsors of the Healthy Americans Act, with that ironclad, loophole-free protection for those with preexisting conditions. So it is not as if somebody just kind of brought this up as a partisan issue. It was bipartisan then. Republican Members of this body, distinguished colleagues, were cospon-sors of that Healthy Americans Act proposition. Now the Trump adminis-tration is trying to turn back the clock. It wants to make junk plans great again—a forced march back to those days that I described that were only for the healthy and the wealthy. The open enrollment plan for health insurance is coming up very quickly. The Trump administration has cut it in half so that it is going to last only a few weeks this year. That means, during the holidays, when Americans are traveling, shopping, and spending time with family, they will also have to make some judgments about health insurance. Because of the Trump ad-ministration’s actions, these junk in-surance policies are going to be peddled at the same time as insurance that would actually cover, meaningfully, the healthcare that our people need. What they are going to be doing with these Trump changes is making life easy for the scam artists but a night-mare for so many Americans who, day in and day out, walk an economic tightrope just trying to pay for essen-tials. These rip-off artists under the Trump plan are going to have a green light to steal the money Americans pay in premiums and for other ex-penses. According to a recent study, sometimes as much as $2 out of every $3 is wasted on overhead with these ad-ministrative costs and junk insurance profits in these flawed policies that the Trump administration wants to foist off on Americans. The disastrous effects of junk insur-ance aren’t limited to those who get conned into buying it. By bringing junk plans back, the Trump adminis-tration, in effect, goes out and swings a wrecking ball into the private health insurance markets in our country. It raises costs across the board, and Americans waste their hard-earned dol-lars. Senator B
ALDWIN has a resolution, and I commend my colleague from Wis-consin on her effort on this. She came and talked with me about this early on, as the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee. We have jurisdiction over something like $1 tril-lion worth of health spending. I really appreciate the expertise and the pas-sion that Senator B
ALDWIN has brought to this issue, and we saw it in her very first presentation on what she wanted to do. Her resolution is the Senate’s best opportunity to put a stop to the scams that I have described. It would throw the Trump administration’s junk insurance rules out, and with Sen-ator B
ALDWIN ’s proposal, it would re-store the protections that millions of Americans count on each day. The Democrats in the Senate are going to stand up for Americans with preexisting conditions, and I hope col-leagues on the other side will join us. I recognize that the Trump administra-tion will not, but my hope is that we will have colleagues on the other side supporting us for Senator B
ALDWIN ’s resolution.

In addition, as if this were not enough of an injury foisted on vulner-able Americans, the Trump administra-tion has put forward a nominee for a seat on the Sixth Circuit Court of Ap-peals who made healthcare sabotage one of his top priorities at the Trump Justice Department. Chad Readler, currently the Deputy Assistant Attor-ney General, in my view, is the wrong choice to be a Federal judge. Earlier this year, the Trump admin-istration decided it just wanted to get out of the business of enforcing the rules that protect Americans with pre-existing conditions. In fact, it had to argue in court that it could abandon that essential part of the Affordable Care Act, which was still the law of the land the last time I looked. Who did the administration turn to when it needed to cook up a dubious legal argu-ment that it had no obligation to en-force the law of the land? Chad Readler. In fact, three career attorneys from the Department of Justice looked at his argument, and they actually withdrew from the case. Three career lawyers from the Department of Jus-tice refused to participate. The Judiciary Committee held a hearing on Mr. Readler’s nomination earlier this month. His nomination could be sent to the floor of the Senate in the coming weeks, but it ought to be clear that this is a nominee who is not an impartial individual who has the ju-dicial temperament Americans expect. He is not somebody who ought to be handed a seat on the Federal bench and have the power to sign off on the Trump administration’s agenda of healthcare sabotage. I close with this. The Senate has an opportunity to stand up this week for the millions of vulnerable Americans who have these preexisting conditions, for the millions of Americans who under the Affordable Care Act can go to bed at night knowing that if they have preexisting conditions, they are not going to lose everything. I am seri-ous when I talk about losing every-thing. Once you go back to discrimi-nating against people with preexisting conditions, you are going to go back to job lock and all of the problems we saw associated with discrimination. If you were in Montana or if you were in Or-egon and had a preexisting condition and you got offered a better job on the other side of town, you couldn’t go get it because you would not be able to get coverage because there was discrimina-tion against people with preexisting conditions. This week the Senate is going to have an opportunity to stand up to the Trump administration and go to bat for the millions and millions of Ameri-cans who are watching this debate who have preexisting conditions and who are just counting on this body not to turn back the clock and leave them vulnerable again. Senator B
ALDWIN ’s resolution would prevent the Trump administration from bringing back the worst abuses of junk insurance. If it doesn’t pass this week, this will be an issue that, in my view, will come up again and again and again until it is fixed. Finally, the Readler nomination, in my view, ought to be stopped in its tracks. The Senate ought to tell the administration that it is not going to rubberstamp judicial nominees who have proven, demonstrable track records of twisting the law in a way that harms the most vulnerable of our citizens. I note that the majority leader is here. I yield the floor. f

TRANSMITTAL NO . 18–38 Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act Annex Item No. vii (vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 1. The E–2D Advanced Hawkeye (AHE) Air-borne Early Warning and Control (AEW&C) provides detection and surveillance of re-gional surface and aircraft platforms through the use of the APY–9 radar, APX– 122A Identification Friend or Foe (IFF), and ALQ–217 Electronic Support Measures (ESM) systems. The E–2D AHE provides area sur-veillance and detection, air intercept con-trol, air traffic control, search and rescue as-sistance, communication relay and auto-matic tactical data exchange. The E–2D AHE is classified SECRET. 2. The APY–9 radar is a mechanically ro-tated, electronically scanned array, which utilizes Space Time Adaptive Processing technology to provide 360–degree detection and surveillance in high clutter environ-ments. It is able to provide simultaneous de-tection and surveillance of surface and air units. The APY–9 radar is classified SE-CRET. 3. The MIDS JTRS (5) terminal provides enhanced Link 16 functionality, namely Con-current Multi-netting with four channels (CMN–4) and Concurrent Contention Receive (CCR). CMN–4 is a Link 16 enhancement that increases the terminal capability from re-ceiving only one Tactical Digital Informa-tion Link–J (TADIL–J) message packing structure per time slot to receive as many as four simultaneous message packing struc-tures per time slot, each transmitted on a unique Link 16 net. The capability for cur-rent Link 16 terminals to receive only one TADIL–J message packing structure per time slot imposes complex network design constraints and prohibits network designers from making full use of the Link 16 spectrum capacity. CMN–4 relaxes these restrictions allowing for greater network planning flexi-bility and achieves a fourfold increase in re-ceive message throughput for Link 16 termi-nals with this capability. CMN–4 is back-wards compatible with JTIDS and MIDS– LVT, although legacy terminals would not be able to experience the increased through-put. CCR described the Link 16 terminal’s ability to receive multiple messages in the same net within the same time slot. The MIDS–JTRS device itself is CCI and is not classified. The COMSEC keying material which is loaded into the device for IFF Mode 4/5 operations is classified SECRET. 4. The APX–122A IFF Interrogator and APX–123A IFF Transponder are identifica-tion systems designed for command and con-trol. They provide the ability to distinguish friendly aircraft, vehicles, or forces, and to determine their bearing and range from the Interrogator. These devices have embedded COMSEC which contains SENSITIVE encryption algorithms and keying material. The APX–122A IFF Interrogator and APX– 123A IFF Transponder devices themselves are CCI and are not classified. The COMSEC key-ing material which is loaded into the devices for IFF Mode 4/5 operations is classified SE-CRET. 5. The ALQ–217 Electronic Support Meas-ure (ESM) system is used to detect, inter-cept, identify, locate, record, and/or analyze sources of radiated electromagnetic energy to support classification of unknown surface and airborne units. The ALQ–217 is classified SECRET. 6. The AN/AYK–27 Integrated Navigation Control and Display System serves as the network manager and the human machine interface for the E–2D navigation system. The AN/AYK–27 is an UNCLASSIFIED sys-tem. 7. The LN–251 Embedded Global Posi-tioning Systems/Inertial Navigation Sys-tems (EGIs) with embedded airborne Selec-tive Availability Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM) Receiver (ASR) system provides position, navigation and timing information to the E–2D via the Global Positioning Sat-ellite system and an inertial measuring unit. The LN–251 is UNCLASSIFIED. 8. If a technologically advanced adversary obtained knowledge of the specific hardware or software in the proposed sale, the infor-mation could be used to develop counter- measures which might reduce weapons sys-tem effectiveness or be used in the develop-ment of a system with similar or advanced capabilities. 9. A Special Security Agreement (SSA) will be in place in order to provide additional security requirements for implementation by the Government of Japan to protect the advanced capabilities this aircraft provides. This sale is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and national security ob-jectives outlined in the Policy Justification. 10. All defense articles and services listed in this transmittal have been authorized for release and export to Japan.

TRANSMITTAL NO . 18–22 Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act Annex Item No. vii (vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 1. The GMLRS M31 Unitary is the Army’s primary munition for units fielding the High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) and Multiple Launcher Rocket Systems (MLRS) M270A1 Rocket and Missile Launcher platforms. The M31 Unitary is a solid propellant artillery rocket that uses Global Positioning System (GPS)-aided iner-tial guidance to accurately and quickly de-liver a single high-explosive blast fragmenta-tion warhead onto point targets at ranges from 15–70 kilometers. The rockets are fired from a launch pod container that also serves as the storage and transportation container for the rockets. Each rocket pod holds six (6) total rockets. 2. The GMLRS Unitary employs a multi- mode fuze consisting of an Electronic Safe and Arm Fuze (ESAF) and a Frequency-Mod-ulating Continuous Wave—Directional Dopp-ler Ranging (FMCW–DDR) height of burst sensor. The weapon has three fuzing modes point detonating, post-impact time delay, and proximity height of burst—which are all accomplished automatically via a launcher/ fire control system electrical interface prior to launch. The height of burst sensor is not integrated with the fuze, but provides fire pulse input and interfaces with a mechanical fuze. 3. GMLRS hardware and operational soft-ware are UNCLASSIFIED. System perform-ance characteristics are classified CON-FIDENTIAL. Components of the GMLRS sys-tem are considered highly resistant to re-verse engineering and the impact of loss or diversion of the end item hardware would have minimum adverse impact. 4. The M57 ATACMS Unitary is a conven-tional, semi-ballistic missile which utilizes a 500–lb high explosive unitary warhead. It has a range of 70–270km and increased accuracy and lethality due to a GPS/PPS-aided guid-ance system. The ATACMS T2K is an up-graded missile variant which redesigned pre-vious variants’ components to compensate for obsolescence issues and lowered per-unit cost. Critical technologies on the M57 in-clude the GPS antenna, laser-ring gyro-scopes production processes involved in the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), and lith-ium thermal batteries used in missile guid-ance and control. ATACMS missile hardware and operational software are UNCLASSI-FIED. Data table and mission critical data generator special applications software are classified CONFIDENTIAL. Performance and accuracy/lethality data are classified up to the SECRET level. System response time and trajectory data are classified CON-FIDENTIAL. 5. The Army’s FMCW–DDR height of burst technology is comprised of components and software requiring special production skills and is deemed state of the art. The sensitive aspects of the technology reside primarily the design, development, production, and manufacturing data for the related compo-nents (integrated circuits and flex cable as-sembly) and in the methodology required to integrate those components onto the flex cable assembly to process embedded data (the software, algorithm, and operating pa-rameters). The sole technology aspect of the FMCW–DDR present in the M31 proximity height of burst sensor is the signal proc-essing algorithm (i.e. processing techniques) modified specifically for use in the M31. The disclosure of know-how, software, and other associated documentation for this sensitive technology is not authorized under this sale. 6. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the infor-mation could be used to develop counter-measures that might reduce weapon system effectiveness or be used in the development of a system with similar or advanced capa-bilities. 7. A determination has been made that Bahrain can provide substantially the same degree of protection of this technology as the U.S. Government. This proposed sale is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and national security objectives out-lined in the Policy Justification. Moreover, the benefits to be derived from this sale, as outlined in the Policy Justification, out-weigh the potential damage that could result if the sensitive technology were revealed to unauthorized persons. 8. All defense articles and services listed in this transmittal are authorized for release and export to the Government of Bahrain.

TRIBUTE TO ANTHONY M CCLAIN Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, today I wish to honor my staff director on the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee Anthony McClain. Tony quietly works behind the scenes, fighting for our Nation’s vet-erans, Active Duty, National Guard, and Reserve servicemembers. In recognition of his selfless service, the National Guard Association has awarded him the Patrick Henry Award for his ‘‘exceptionally strong support for the National Guard.’’ This award is presented to civilians who have distinguished themselves by superior service over an extended pe-riod of time in support of the Armed Forces. I cannot think of a more deserving individual. Since Tony began working in the Senate in 2004, he has worked hard to improve the lives of National guards-men and their families. He cut his teeth as legislative assistant to Sen-ator Blanche Lincoln, then I was lucky enough to personally hire him in 2010. In my office, he wrote landmark leg-islation to expand guardsmen’s access to a quality education, and he went to the mat for the Montana National Guard time and again.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6731 October 9, 2018 
Tony helped improve mental health services for guardsmen by writing leg-islation that strengthens access to counseling at VA facilities. He has written several bills that break down barriers for guardsmen to utilize G.I. Bill education benefits. When the Montana National Guard needs help with keeping their equip-ment and resources in fighting shape, Tony is an ally they can rely on. He helped secure additional aircraft, infra-structure, and critical upgrades such as firefighting equipment or the recently authorized C–130 apron expansion. I could go on and on, but Tony’s track record is clear. Tony’s ability to negotiate, com-promise, see opportunity, and seize it is second to none. He manages and mo-tivates his team to excel, and as a re-sult, the lives of millions of guards-men, Reservists, airmen, and veterans are better. As Senators, we get to stand on the Senate floor and pass legislation. Peo-ple like Tony make it look easy, but trust me it is not. For that, Tony deserves our heartfelt gratitude. So today, on behalf of Mon-tana and this Nation, I rise to honor Anthony McClain’s service and to say, ‘‘Job well done, my friend.’’

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
REMEMBERING RICHARD GRAY ∑Ms. DUCKWORTH. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life of Rich-ard Gray. Richard, 89, died in his sleep on Wednesday, May 16, 2018, at his Gold Coast home in Chicago. Richard was the dean of Chicago art dealers, a collector, and benefactor whose wide-ranging intellect, taste, and support helped many of the city’s most celebrated cultural institutions. Richard prevailed in the bidding wars that brought Sue, the famed T. rex, to the Field Museum, and he helped pre-serve the Farnsworth House, the archi-tectural jewel in Plano, IL, designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. He dealt in works by Magdalena Abakanowicz, Willem de Kooning, David Hockney, Roy Lichtenstein, Louise Nevelson, Picasso, Jackson Pol-lock, and Mark Rothko. Today, the Richard Gray Gallery which he opened in 1963, operates from 875 N. Michigan and Manhattan. The gallery has a warehouse on West Carroll Avenue in Chicago and also deals in Old Masters. He and his wife, the former Mary Kay Lackritz, were supporters of the Chi-cago Humanities Festival, the Art In-stitute of Chicago, the Arts Club of Chicago, the Chicago Symphony Or-chestra, the Goodman Theatre, WFMT, WTTW, and the Smart Museum of Art at the University of Chicago, among other institutions. He was born at Woodlawn Hospital, the middle of seven kids of Pearl and Edward Gray. His father, a native of Siedliszcze, Poland, came to America alone as a teenager and helped to start a business in Providence, RI, cleaning buildings in that then-sooty city, even-tually coming to Chicago. Richard studied architecture at the University of Illinois Urbana-Cham-paign. Richard is survived by his wife Mary, his son Paul and his wife Dedrea, his daughter Jennifer, his son Harry, brothers Robert and Melvin, five grand-children, and a great-grandchild. Richard was a lover of the arts and a dear friend. I am proud to stand here today to honor his legacy.∑ f 
90TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ABBE MUSEUM ∑Mr. KING. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the Abbe Museum in Bar Harbor, ME, which is celebrating its 90th year of serving the public. The Abbe Museum was founded by Dr. Rob-ert Abbe, a prominent New York physi-cian, known for pioneering the use of radiation therapy, who spent his sum-mers in Bar Harbor. Dr. Abbe assem-bled a collection of early Native Amer-ican artifacts from the Frenchman Bay area and persuaded others with similar collections to join with him to estab-lish a museum to protect and display these important objects for public edu-cation and enjoyment. The Abbe Museum was founded in 1926 and opened to the public on August 14, 1928. It was first opened as a private museum at Sieur de Monts Spring in Lafayette National Park, later re-named Acadia National Park. That same year, the Abbe became the first institution in Maine to also sponsor ar-chaeological research. Today, the mu-seum continues to conduct excavations throughout the State and is now the main repository for archaeological col-lections from the midcoast region. While the initial focus was archae-ology, the Abbe soon expanded to in-clude ethnographic materials from the 17th to the 20th centuries. Three years after opening, Mary Cabot Wheelwright donated an important collection of Na-tive American baskets and other ob-jects. Since then, other major basket collections have been given to the mu-seum, and it is now home to the largest and best documented collection of Maine Indian basketry. The Abbe also houses collections that document 12,000 years of Native American culture and history in the State, and its conserva-tion program has been nationally rec-ognized as a model for other museums to follow. Education and local involvement is also an important part of the work at the Abbe. The Abbe has developed a number of publications to share its knowledge with a larger audience. They offer many resources for local students and educators, including a summer camp for children ages 7–12, opportunities for local school groups to visit the museum, and an educator hub to help teachers bring Wabanaki his-tory and culture into their classrooms. Recently, Native Americans have be-come increasingly involved in all as-pects of the museum, including as members of the board of trustees. In 2013, the Abbe was honored as the first Smithsonian Affiliate in the State of Maine. Being a part of this pres-tigious network, the Abbe Museum now works closely with the Smithsonian In-stitution to serve the public through custom developed education programs, traveling exhibitions, and collabo-rative research. This partnership has allowed the Abbe to take advantage of the resources of the Smithsonian Insti-tution and bring collections that have special significance to Maine where they can be accessed by the Wabanaki communities. I am proud to recognize the Abbe Mu-seum for their work over the last 90 years. They have played an important role in educating the people of Maine about the Wabanaki history of our land and expanding our knowledge through research and exploration. I want to thank all those who have been involved with the Abbe Museum over the last 90 years, and I look forward to their con-tinued success for many years to come.∑

S. R ES. 670 Whereas, on October 3, 2008, the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 (sub-title B of title V of Public Law 110–343) (re-ferred to in this preamble as the ‘‘MHPAEA’’) was signed into law; Whereas the MHPAEA ensures that em-ployer-based group health plans and group and individual health insurance issuers that provide mental health or substance use dis-order coverage do not impose less favorable limitations on mental health or substance abuse use disorder benefits than on medical or surgical benefits; Whereas parity protections have been found to decrease out-of-pocket costs for mental health and substance use disorder services; Whereas, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, in 2017, 18,200,000 individuals in the United States ages 12 and older needed substance use treatment but did not receive specialty treatment in the past year; Whereas, in the United States in 2017, an estimated 2 out of 5 adults with any mental illness and 
1⁄2of adults with serious mental illness who had unmet needs for mental health services did not receive treatment be-cause those individuals could not afford the cost of care; and Whereas parity in insurance coverage for behavioral health services consistent with the requirements of the MHPAEA can pro-vide access to life-saving treatment and services: Now, therefore be it Resolved, That the Senate— (1) commemorates October 3, 2018, as the tenth anniversary of the enactment of the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 (subtitle B of title V of Public Law 110– 343); (2) declares access to behavioral health services a priority; and (3) supports enforcement of the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 to protect individuals in the United States who are in need of access to insurance coverage for behavioral health services. f PRIVILEGES OF THE FLOOR Mr. GRASSLEY.

TRIBUTE TO CHARLES C. COOK, SR. 
HON. ROBERT A. BRADY 
OF PENNSYLVANIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 9, 2018 Mr. BRADY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the service of Charles C. Cook, Sr., formerly Superintendent of Con-gressional Publishing Division at the U.S. Gov-ernment Publishing Office, on the occasion of his death on Friday, September 28. Charlie, as he was known to his colleagues, graduated in 1960 from Catonsville High School in Catonsville, Maryland, and went to work at Key Press in Arbutus for a salary of $1.50 per hour. It was at Key Press that Char-lie earned his Printing Apprentice Degree. He then moved to Modern Linotype, and from there to the U.S. Government Printing Office, as the GPO was formerly known, in 1969, where he spent the rest of his career. At the GPO, Charlie rose to the position of Superintendent of the GPO’s Congressional Publishing Division, which is responsible for ensuring the production and delivery of all of the printing and digital work ordered by Con-gress, including the C
ONGRESSIONAL RECORD , bills, reports, hearings, and all of the other documents required by Congress in carrying out its legislative duties. During his tenure, Charlie helped lead the introduction of digital publishing of the con-gressional documents by the GPO, which has reduced the cost and greatly expanded public access to this critically important information. He was also involved with devising improved security measures for the delivery of congres-sional materials following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Charlie drew strong praise from Congress for his work, which in-cluded managing the production of materials for the 1997 and 2001 Presidential inaugura-tions as well as materials associated with the impeachment of President Clinton. Indeed, Charlie’s professionalism stood out across the legislative branch, and as Superintendent of Congressional Publishing he was a key partici-pant in the day to day operations that sup-ported Congress. Charlie was well-known to his colleagues at the GPO, and especially to the many for whom he acted as mentor and advisor, as a manager with a deep understanding of the GPO’s work and a model of dedication to GPO’s historic mission. He was generous with his time and knowledge, unfailingly kind, and perennially good humored. In the final stage of his career, Charlie was tapped to become Di-rector of New Business Development at the GPO, a senior executive position from which he retired. Mr. Speaker, I commend the work and ca-reer of Charlie Cook to my colleagues, and extend the sympathy of this House to his wife, Norene, and his children and grandchildren. CONSTITUENT COMMENTS ON SOBER LIVING HOME PROBLEMS HON. DANA ROHRABACHER 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 9, 2018 Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, I rise again regarding the hearing held by the Judici-ary Subcommittee on the Constitution and Civil Justice on September 28, 2018 on the issue of sober living homes. At that hearing, I had the privilege of testifying at that hearing in support of my bill, H.R. 5724, to restore local oversight over sober living homes. As part of my testimony, I submitted to the Sub-committee letters from many of my constitu-ents about problems with sober living homes caused by current federal law preventing ap-propriate local oversight. For the benefit of my colleagues and the American people, I include in the R
ECORD the second group of these con-stituent letters: 
In mid-February the home next door was sold to a LLC. The home was converted to a sober living home. I do not know how many men live at the facility but notice that new men are coming and going all day. There are different cars parked weekly. I hope none of these men have criminal backgrounds. Have cut down going outside the home. Stopped the evening walk. Have an ADT security sys-tem and installed motion lights all around the home. Initially they smoked cigarettes in the backyard and we lost all use of our back-yard. On constant complaining to [RE-DACTED] they moved the smoking to the other side of the home. It did not help much as now they had begun to smoke e-cigarettes and vaping also. The smell in our home is terrible. We use Hepa filter air purifiers in the home. Keep half the home windows closed. Our home has become more of a pris-on. My husband and I have chronic multiple health issues. The smoke and e cigarette pol-lutants cause me to have a constant cough, irritated nose, burning eyes and sometimes headaches. I wear a N99 pollution mask all day in the home. I daily leave the home for a few hours to take the mask off. I also try to spend a night or two outside the home. When the symptoms get further aggravated I get checked by my Physician. I last visited him on August 31, 2018. It affects me more than my husband. These homes are built for single family use and not for group smoking and vaping. Our family room and sober living home family room is 10 feet apart. My husband and I are covered under the ADA, we are covered but not the facility and medical personnel we use. The addict should be covered under the ADA but why are the owners and medical personnel covered also. A few years back every residential neigh-borhood in Huntington Beach had a park and school. Today every residential neighbor-hood has a few sober living home/detox fa-cilities. Schools are closing, and many parks are unsafe for children. J
OTIGHUMAN , Huntington Beach, California. 
Since having a sober living home open nearly behind my home, the quality of life in this neighborhood has deteriorated greatly. What has been a quiet neighborhood where people feel safe to live their lives, raise their children, and go about their daily lives in a secure environment has changed. Now I need to be certain every night that every door and window in my home is locked and secure. We had an incident in which drug users from the sober living home ran from the police through not only my but several neighbor’s yards, with police searching through those yards at 2 am, with the suspects attempting to enter at least one home in the attempt to evade police. Many neighbors speak of seeing people committing suspicious activities in on the grounds of the local school, which is approximately three homes away from the sober living home. Many neighbors are so anxious about the deterioration of the neigh-borhood that they are selling their homes, with many others discussing doing so as well. We need more oversight as to who man-ages these homes, as I understand, the one in my neighborhood is managed by an indi-vidual with multiple felonies. This is insane, and regulations need to be implemented. Thank you for reading my issues. EDWARD SKELTON , Huntington Beach, California. 
I live a few houses away from a sober liv-ing home where drug use has gone on there. Even worse someone from there entered an-other person’s home on our block in the mid-dle of the night. It saddens me that there is not much regulation regarding these homes and they can just open anywhere. We have families with little kids in the area and a school down the street from us. These homes need to be regulated and their clients prop-erly cared for. There should be proof that pa-tients are benefiting from these homes be-fore we spend all this money to make owners of them rich, while everyone suffers includ-ing the community. G
INAMACDONALD , Huntington Beach, California. 
We live in a town house in Aliso Viejo, California. Our walls are connected to other homes on both sides. In 2015/2016 one of our neighbors moved out and turned her home into a sober living home. For almost 2 years we lived in constant fear of the revolving door of people going in and out of that house. During that time, we (and our neighbors) had to call the Orange County Sheriff’s De-partment because of numerous violent fights, at all hours of the night. My girlfriend witnessed an individual who seemed to have overdosed in front of our ga-rage. There were numerous fights, strange chemical smells coming out of the house, sheriffs and other emergency vehicles con-stantly next door. Residents would wander the neighborhood and at hours of the day and just stand outside our home, looking right into our windows. We had to lock our doors, close the blinds and request that they smoke down the street. We are still worried that methamphetamine was possibly being cooked and was the source of the chemical smells coming from inside the home. Again, we share a wall and we worry about possible long-term risks of exposure. At one time, the boyfriend of one of the residents was wanted by the United States Marine Corps. The home owner stopped by our home and provided me the investigators

phone number. We had strict instructions to call her if we ever saw him at the house. Why are we responsible for this? Two separate nights, someone from this house tried to walk into our house. Luckily our front door was locked, and they just slammed into the door. In late 2016, one of the residents passed away inside the home. The home is still some kind of a ‘‘facility’’ for people with problems but we have not had the problems that occurred in 2015–2016. The current residents are nice but due to the constant change of occupants, we still live in fear that something could happen at any time. It’s been almost 4 years of hell and I think it is unacceptable that the state al-lows someone to open a place like this, with little to no restrictions and the neighbor-hood has no rights or protection against this from happening. No family should live in fear due to some-one else’s greed. We talked to the city, HOA and Sheriff’s department multiple times and all said that there was nothing they could do to help. They wanted to help but said the state says this is ok. Although we under-stand that people need help, but our safety and peace of mind should not be sacrificed. That is our story and can back it up with emails to our HOA every time an incident happened. A
LBERT FRANCIS , Aliso Viejo, California. 
My name is Virginia Mccoy, mother of four children, wife of a police officer, and a posi-tive role model in my community in Hun-tington Beach, CA. I live across the street from our public middle school, and directly diagonal to a new sober living house. Unfortunately, the house is not sober, and is impeding on the safety and happiness in our neighborhood. Drugs, alcohol, speeding, and the lack of respect to neighbors has truly put a stain on our once wonderful family neighborhood. I am no longer comfortable letting my 14- year-old daughter ride her bike in the neigh-borhood, walk our family dog, or walk to her friend’s home down the street. Just today, September 5, 2018, was the first day of school, witnessed many parents drop their child off right in front of this ‘‘Sober Living House.’’ The fact that parents have no idea that just a couple weeks ago the occupants along with others were smoking heroine, were chased by police, broke into a neigh-bor’s home, and were never caught, is truly terrifying. I urge and plead for firm regulation and stricter laws to combat fraudulent sober liv-ing homes, protect our neighborhoods, and protect children in school neighborhoods. V
IRGINIA MCCOY, Huntington Beach, California. 
There are two SLHs in our neighborhood in Huntington Beach near [ADDRESS]. One of these is our neighboring house that was oc-cupied earlier this year. Our neighbor of forty years died, and her children sold the home. Since the SLH has been occupied we have been impacted by constant cigarette smoke and vape vapor. Our incessant complaints to the owner’s manager have mitigated the smoked vapors to the point where it is less frequently noted. This has not however re-duced our health impacts. My wife has con-stant complaint of itching eyes and irritated throat. She has now been coughing for over two months with some bouts that are per-sistent over many minutes. During a doctor visit last week she was advised to reduce in- house irritants. My allergies have been exasperated since the SLH facility has moved in. Incidents of running nose and coughing have increased and I now have daily bouts of sneezing. After having lived in our house for over forty years we are now confronting a situa-tion where our neighbors are impacting our health making it impossible to peacefully enjoy our home. The occupants of the SLH are transient who have shown no interest in any involvement in the neighborhood. We do not know who the occupants are, or many people live there. We hope you are able to use our experience in providing input to any congressional hear-ing on the subject. OPJITGHUMAN , Huntington Beach, California. 
I have lived in my home since 1966. With two different 4-year breaks. My husband, Marc, and I have lived here continuously since March of 1988. I was raised in this home and we have raised our two daughters here, also. We have a lovely neighborhood and fan-tastic neighbors. Most of whom have also lived here for more than a decade. I have been very involved with [REDACTED] school as a volunteer in various capacities includ-ing PTSA President. In recent months it has come to our atten-tion that [ADDRESS] is no longer a family home. It is now a DETOX CENTER. How do I know? Diligent research by myself and other neighbors. Drug Incident: The research began in depth after very disturbing events in the early morning hours of Friday, August 24, 2018 ap-proximately 1:40 am at [ADDRESS]. The same early morning, the Huntington Beach Police were summoned to the sidewalk next to [ADDRESS] after another neighbor wit-nessed drugs being cooked and shot-up. The suspects scattered, and two males ran into the side yard of [ADDRESS] and hopped backyards between the homes on [AD-DRESS]. Camera surveillance is available from the backyard of [ADDRESS] and front door of [ADDRESS]. There was a backpack abandoned on the side walk next to [AD-DRESS] that contained a significant amount of drugs. Camera footage available from [AD-DRESS]. HBPD Case No. [REDACTED]. Pit Bull Incident: Monday August 27, 2018 my neighbor [NAME] was prevented from exiting her car in her driveway at [AD-DRESS] because of a barking pit bull on her property. She pulled into my driveway and into my home to ask me to whom the pit bull belonged. I told her it belonged to [AD-DRESS]. We proceeded to call Animal Con-trol after witnessing the dog roam across the street and down to the corner, barking the entire time at anyone it saw. I have video of the Pit bull charging into the street towards me while I am near my front door. When Of-ficer [NAME] from Animal Control arrived, the dog continued to bark and began growl-ing repeatedly. Officer [NAME] told me that this dog was in violation of Cade 41–51 Pro-tection From Animals and was a mis-demeanor offense. I have copies available of the neighbor statements regarding violation [REDACTED]. Research: Research has revealed that the house at [ADDRESS] is now owned by [NAME] is listed as principle. [NAME] pur-chased this house on [ADDRESS]. Resident of the home (believed to be a House Manager) is [NAME]. [NAME] has an extensive criminal past including multiple drug charges, multiple DUis and was most recently imprisoned for securities fraud. [NAME] is currently on parole. How do we know that? His parole officer knocked on the incorrect door and demanded to speak with [NAME}. [NAME] said that she did not know [NAME]. The PO eventually realized her mis-take and knocked at [ADDRESS]. No one an-swered. [NAME] is the owner of the pit bull reported to animal control. [NAME]’s co-defendant in the securities fraud case [RE-DACTED], has been at [ADDRESS] at least three times. THIS DETOX HOUSE HAS AFFECTED MY FAMILY IN THE FOLLOWING WAYS: I CAN NO LONGER SLEEP WITH MY WINDOWS OPEN. I CAN NO LONGER ALLOW MY GRAND-NIECE AND GRANDNEPHEW TO WALK TO AND FROM THEIR HOME TO MINE (3 HOUSES) WITHOUT DIRECT SUPER-VISION. I AM CONSTANTLY LOOKING FOR ANY-THING THAT IS UNFAMILIAR IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD. I WORRY ABOUT MY NEIGHBORS. I WORRY ABOUT THE SCHOOL CHIL-DREN THAT WALK TO [REDACTED] SCHOOL ON MY STREET EVERY MORN-ING AND AFTERNOON. I CANNOT SLEEP SOUNDLY. I HAVE INSTALLED SECURITY CAM-ERAS. I DO NOT FEEL SAFE. Please allow our local government to have jurisdiction in MY neighborhood. HBPD has yet to gather video evidence from any neigh-bors regarding the drug charge. There is no detective assigned to the case at present time. J

I wanted to share my opinion on the sober living homes. I have lived in Costa Mesa for many years. The city has gone through a major transformation due largely to the sober living homes. There are young adults that now live on our streets because they were ‘‘bought’’ from out of state, went to a sober living home, and then kicked to the street when the money ran out. They have no method to get home and mostly return to drugs while they live on the streets. I saw a young female crying sitting with her suit-case. Apparently, her time was done at the sober living home, they would not help her return home (out of state) and the people she was with robbed her of her money and other possessions. We gave her the info for Costa Mesa Homeless Network solutions. I live across the street from a sober living home. The company was able to buy a $925k home and the people that run it drive Audis, Jag-uars, and of course, there is the $80k Mer-cedes that shows up. There are cars every-where around this sober living home in our neighborhood, there are often young males sitting in cars in our neighborhood (some-times for hours), and there are kids smoking everywhere. I am appalled that this has con-tinued to exist. We are essentially allowing human trafficking to pay these broker fees to feed enough people into their ‘‘sober liv-ing home factory’’. They are supposed to help the tenants return home, where they may have a support system. However, that would cost them money; their only business is to make money. I would ask a change in the law to state you must be a resident of California for 12 months to enter a sober liv-ing home here and there may be no exchange of ‘‘broker’’ fees to buy bodies for their homes. We need to clean up our neighbor-hoods. Crime has skyrocketed in our neigh-borhood. Our mail is stolen, packages are stolen, cars are broken into, and our homes are being broken into. We need to enact these new requirements and the state must regulate them. They must send in inspectors to make sure these homes are free of drugs, the tenants are from California for the last 12 months, and that there was no money ex-changed to find these people. We have been essentially wasting tax money to make our city less safe. E

RECOGNIZING THE INTER-NATIONAL DAY OF THE GIRL 
HON. STEVE CHABOT 
OF OHIO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 9, 2018 Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize October 11 as the International Day of the Girl, which falls this upcoming Thurs-day. The International Day of the Girl is a day to draw attention to, and seek solutions for, the challenges that confront girls throughout the world. This year’s theme for the International Day of the Girl centers on educating girls for to-day’s and tomorrow’s economy. That is why I wish to highlight the Protecting Girls’ Access to Education Act, legislation that I introduced last year with Congresswoman R
OBIN KELLY, which seeks to better ensure that the edu-cational needs of displaced girls are consid-ered in the design, implementation, and eval-uation of our foreign assistance. This legisla-tion is vitally important since, according to the UN High Commission on Refugees, there are approximately 65 million forcibly displaced people worldwide and half are under the age of 18. Prolonged periods away from home re-sult in low school enrollment rates for dis-placed children, which leaves girls vulnerable to early marriage, human trafficking, and child labor. With these urgent needs in mind, I urge the Senate to swiftly pass the Protecting Girls’ Access to Education Act. The International Day of the Girl is a day to work towards ensuring that girls around the globe have access to safe, quality education. As this year’s theme reminds us, girls have better opportunities when they have access to quality education and a safe environment in which to learn.

PAKISTAN’S FOREIGN MINISTER SHOULD RETURN HOME EMPTY- HANDED 
HON. TED POE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 9, 2018 Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, Pakistan’s Foreign Minister was here this week to urge the White House to renew assistance to his country and plead for our help in talks with India. While I do not oppose open engage-ment with Pakistan, our position must be clear: Pakistan will not receive a dime of U.S. support if terrorists continue to live safely on their soil. For too long the opposite has been the case. Fortunately, President Trump has disrupted the status quo and suspended most of the funding we give to Pakistan, specifically calling them out for their support to terrorism. But more should be done. The continued violence in Afghanistan is di-rectly the result of Pakistan’s protection of the Taliban, al-Qaeda, and other murderous ter-rorists in the region. After 9/11, U.S. and allied forces had defeated the extremists in Afghani-stan. But Pakistan opened its doors to Osama bin Laden, Mullah Omar, and the entire lead-ership of al-Qaeda and the Taliban. We know this because these terrorist thugs were found and killed in Pakistan. With Pakistani help, their terrorist networks were able to rebuild and launch an insurgency in Afghanistan that has killed thousands of Americans. It is insulting that Pakistan’s Foreign Min-ister comes to Washington and dares to lec-ture us for holding them to account. Just yes-terday, another American was killed fighting extremists in Afghanistan. Our nation con-tinues to sacrifice to bring peace to Afghani-stan, while leaders of the Taliban enjoy the shelter of Pakistan. If the Foreign Minister was truly interested in restoring the relationship be-tween our two countries, he would accept re-sponsibility and acknowledge that countless terrorists still live inside Pakistan. His country has been the epicenter for extremism for dec-ades, where extremists are still able to hold massive public rallies to incite young men to violence. This isn’t conjecture, the evidence is well documented. For example, Hafiz Muhammad Saeed, the founder of the U.S. and U.N.-designated ter-rorist group Lashkar-e-Taiba, operates freely in Pakistan. Despite his role in the 2008 Mumbai attack, he leads public rallies and can raise money for extremists causes. Yet, Paki-stan, including its Ministry of Foreign Affairs, consistently defends Saeed and condemns U.S. counterterrorism efforts. Pakistan’s For-eign Minister even claimed terrorist groups that target Pakistan have safe haven in Af-ghanistan under the U.S.’s watch. Yet it is Pakistani officials who somehow claim there is a ‘‘good’’ Taliban, while the U.S. makes no distinction. If the Foreign Minister wanted to earn our trust, his government could dem-onstrate good faith by taking action. This in-cludes handing over Mr. Saeed, the leaders of the Taliban and Haqqani Network, and ban-ning all extremist groups on its soil. But this is a fantasy. The hope that Pakistan would do the responsible thing ended a long time ago. Now is the day of reckoning. All assistance to Pakistan must end, its Major Non-NATO Ally status must be terminated, and the State Department should immediately designate it as a state sponsor of terrorism. The glad- handing with Pakistani politicians cannot cover for the obvious misdeeds of their country. The Foreign Minister came to Washington empty- handed and should return to Pakistan empty- handed. Seventeen years of appeasing Paki-stan has gotten us nowhere and a new course must be taken. Turn out the lights—the party is over for Pakistan. And that’s just the way it is.

RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF NATIONAL DISABILITY EM-PLOYMENT AWARENESS MONTH 
HON. DAVID G. REICHERT 
OF WASHINGTON  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 9, 2018 Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize National Disability Employment Awareness Month. This celebration of service began in 1945, when the military men and women returned from World War II with life-altering injuries and disabilities they received during their service in the war. When they returned, they were held back from reentering the workforce because of these limiting disabilities. This sparked public interest and soon after the end of the war, President Franklin D. Roosevelt declared the first week of October as National Employ the Physically Handicapped Week. As awareness grew across the country of the diversity of disabilities individuals have, the week was renamed in 1962 to National Em-ploy the Handicapped Week. In 1988, Congress passed the Handicapped Programs Technical Amendments Act of 1988, establishing October as National Disability Employment Awareness Month. Throughout this month, we celebrate and continue to in-crease awareness of the many contributions of workers with disabilities and emphasize the value of a workforce inclusive of their talents, skills, and unique perspectives. Employees with disabilities of all types bring the valuable qualities of reliability, dedication, loyalty, a positive attitude, and strong work ethic to their places of employment. This moti-vates their fellow colleagues and has a pro-found impact on their workplace. That is why in Congress, we continue to work towards cre-ating inclusive workplace cultures around the country and establishing training opportunities for job seekers and employees with disabil-ities. This month, I join all workers with disabil-ities, their families, and the constituents of Washington’s Eighth District in recognizing this special occasion and celebrating the contribu-tions they have made to our communities, state, and nation. f 
CALLING FOR THE IMMEDIATE RELEASE OF ABDUL SHAKOOR 
HON. JAMIE RASKIN 
OF MARYLAND  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 9, 2018 Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call for the immediate release of Abdul Shakoor, a prisoner of conscience currently in-carcerated in Pakistan, and a man who has been persecuted for his belief in the Ahmadiyya Muslim faith. Mr. Shakoor is an 82-year old who manages an optician’s store and bookshop in the main bazaar of Rabwah in Punjab province. Rabwah is the de facto headquarters of Pakistan’s Ahmadiyya Muslim community, known as Ahmadis. Mr. Shakoor is a beloved figure in Rabwah where he is known as a pillar of the commu-nity, a leader, a conciliator, and peacemaker. He is referred to by all as ‘‘Brother’’ Shakoor. In 1997, Pakistan passed the Anti-Terrorism Act, which provided for a broad definition of terrorism and created special Anti-Terrorism Courts to try individuals accused of violating the law. In the 20 years since it became law, the Anti-Terrorism Act has been increasingly used as a cudgel to persecute religious mi-norities within Pakistan, with a specific mali-cious focus trained on Ahmadi Muslims. This is because Pakistan’s Constitution declares members of the Ahmadiyya faith as non-Mus-lims, and Pakistan’s Penal Code criminalizes their existence for ‘‘posing as Muslim,’’ sub-jecting them to three years imprisonment and potential capital punishment. Thus, Ahmadis are legally rendered heretical and thus illegal in Pakistan because Ahmadi Muslims believe that the founder of their faith, Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, was divinely appointed as the prom-ised Mahdi and Messiah.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD —Extensions of RemarksE1386 October 9, 2018 
On December 2nd and 9th of 2015, Brother Shakoor’s bookshop was raided by the Counter Terrorism Department of the Punjab police and the counterterrorism focused Elite Force. He and his assistant, Mazhar Abbas, a Shia Muslim, were arrested for the crime of distributing Ahmadiyya commentaries on the Qur’an. Brother Shakoor was charged with violating both the Anti-Terrorism Act, for ‘‘dis-seminating any material to incite hatred,’’ and the Pakistani Penal code for committing acts or speech that insult a religion or defile the Qur’an or the Prophet Muhammad. Brother Shakoor was brought to trial within a month before the Anti-Terrorism Court in Faisalabad, Punjab. The only witnesses at the trial were the officers who raided his bookstore who entered into evidence a letter supposedly recovered during the December 9 raid. The letter, purportedly from the Ahmadiyya Director of Public Affairs, notified Brother Shakoor that some Ahmadiyya literature had been banned and he should neither display nor sell it. How-ever, the literature cited in the letter, and for which Brother Shakoor was prosecuted, was not banned until January 20, 2016, after the trial had concluded. Obviously, religious lit-erature cannot be banned under international human rights law in any case. Brother Shakoor contended at trial, and maintains the position, that while he was in possession of the literature, he did not dis-tribute it. Yet, the anti-terrorism court Judge Raja Parvaiz Akhtar announced Brother Shakoor’s conviction under the Anti-Terrorism Act and Sentenced him to eight years impris-onment for his alleged crimes, dealing a ter-rible blow to the local Ahmadiyya community. The shop assistant, Mr. Abbas, was convicted under the Anti-Terrorism Act as well and was sentenced to five years in prison. Since his conviction, Brother Shakoor has appealed the verdict and petitioned for bail on appeal to the Lahore High Court, but he has remained in jail. The case has been listed on the Lahore High Court’s daily docket on sev-eral occasions, but it has been repeatedly postponed. The last postponed hearing date is believed to have been June 22, 2017, and the matter has not been noticed since to the best of our knowledge. Brother Shakoor remains in prison and is suffering from medical conditions which we cannot say are being attended to, including hernia and severe weakness owing to old age. For example, the distance within the jail facility between the daily meeting point and his cell is very long, and so he needs to be transported with help from a warden be-cause he cannot even make that basic walk by foot. When anti-terrorism statutes are used to persecute practitioners of minority religious communities who have done nothing but ob-serve their faith, they are obviously illegitimate instruments of tyranny and threaten public support for legitimate anti-terrorism policies. Brother Shakoor’s imprisonment is a scan-dalous abuse of an anti-terror law and de-mands international condemnation. He should be freed immediately. As the world’s first constitutional democracy, America must defend the freedoms of speech, expression, and religion against state persecu-tion everywhere. So today, I ask my col-leagues to join me in standing with Brother Shakoor and calling for his release, as well as that of Mr. Abbas. RECOGNITION OF REV. ALPHONSO WASHINGTON 
HON. DAVE BRAT 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 9, 2018 Mr. BRAT. Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the 105th year of life of the Reverend Alphonso Washington. Rev. Washington was raised by his grandparents in Hume, Virginia. He attended the Mount Morris Primitive Baptist Church (later called Mount Morris Baptist Church), where his grandfather served as the pastor. He went to school while also working odd jobs to help his mother and stepfather. Beyond working on the family farm, he also took on plumbing and construction jobs. In No-vember 1942, he received a letter from ‘‘your uncle’’ . . . Uncle Sam, stating Alphonso Washington had been drafted into the U.S. Army. He was sent to Fort Meade, MD, for about a week, and then traveled by train to the new Air Navigation School in San Marcos, Texas. The U.S. Army was still segregated at that time, and while the white barracks had been built on the new base, there were no black barracks yet. He and his fellow soldiers slept on the train and then in tents until the black barracks were completed. Since there were no black chaplains, and he had preaching experience, Alphonso was as-signed to the base Chaplain Corp. It was dur-ing this timeframe Rev. Washington made a truly risky stand for God. While praying for troops that were heading out to war, a new Chaplain Officer, Major Dunn, stated: ‘‘I will not swear to you there is a God, because I have not seen Him. . . .’’ Thinking those troops definitely needed their faith strength-ened, not reduced, Private First Class Wash-ington stood up and challenged the Major re-garding God’s existence. For this, he was charged with insubordination, and ‘‘black-balled’’ from promotion in lieu of Court Mar-shall. After the war, Rev. Washington re-mained in the San Marcos area for nearly 60 years with his first wife, Rosa Mae. When Rev. Washington moved back to Vir-ginia in the early 2000s, he returned to Mount Morris Baptist Church and served as an asso-ciate minister, traveling to preach in local churches, perform marriages, funerals, and counseling. He was later appointed to the po-sition of Senior Statesman, where he con-tinues to serve through preaching, committee appointments, the Sunday School Conference, the Women’s Auxiliary and Ministers and Dea-cons Conference. In 2002, he married his cur-rent wife and former secretary of the church, Carol Whitmore. In 2009, he wrote an autobiography called, ‘‘All in God’s Time’’ and has held book signings and been the keynote speaker throughout Fauquier and Culpeper Counties. The book contains his memoirs from his early days in Hume through his marriage to Carol at the time he wrote the book. He has served as an American Legion Chaplain since 1946 and has been preaching the Word of God for over 83 years. Rev. Washington and his wife Carol currently reside in Culpeper, VA. I’m happy to honor Rev. Alphonso Washington on 105 years of life and know he will continue to do great things. IRAN IS MAKING A MOCKERY OF INTERNATIONAL LAW HON. TED POE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 9, 2018 Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, earlier this week, Secretary of State Pompeo announced the U.S. was ending the 1955 Treaty of Amity, Economic Relations, and Consular Rights with Iran. This justified decision comes after three decades of Iran blatantly violating its terms. No other state has defied international norms to such severity as Iran. The terrorist regime in Tehran has no respect for international law or multilateral agreements, and thus should not be shown the respect responsible nations are afforded. Just earlier this week, a German court ruled that an Iranian diplomat violated his diplomatic immunity for participating in an attempted ter-rorist operation in France. Meanwhile, Iranian proxies fired rockets at U.S. diplomatic out-posts in Iraq. But this was nothing new. Since the founding of the Islamic Republic, Iran has flouted all diplomatic protocol to pursue its murderous agenda. Its diplomats use their special status to facilitate terrorism, assas-sinate dissidents, and pursue sanctions bust-ing schemes. For example, in the early 1990s Iranian diplomats in Argentina were deeply in-volved in the terrorist bombings of the Israeli embassy and AMIA Jewish center. This clas-sic Iranian behavior continues around the globe today. Despite these outrageous acts, Iran has the audacity to pursue legal action against the U.S. based on the 1955 treaty, claiming U.S. sanctions violate its terms. Yet, the Islamic Republic ignores the fact that it terminated the treaty the day it raided the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and held U.S. diplomats hostage. That day in 1979 the mullahs in Iran replaced amity with hostility. Nevertheless, Iran’s Foreign Min-ister blames the U.S., calling us an ‘‘outlaw re-gime.’’ Why any nation takes Iran’s govern-ment seriously is beyond logical explanation. By enabling Iran’s duplicitous and evil be-havior, organizations like the International Court of Justice undermine their own legit-imacy. What justice are the Iranian people shown when they are beat and murdered by regime thugs in their own streets? What jus-tice is shown to the victims of Iranian sup-ported terrorism around the globe? The ICJ’s decision is a joke where only the murderers in Tehran are laughing. It is time for our partners in the international community to grow a spine and stand up to the illegal behavior of the Ira-nian regime. No nation is safe so long as we allow the mullahs in Iran to mock justice rather than be held to it.

around the world living with rare diseases and who rely on the availability of plasma protein therapies, no day is ordinary. On October 8 to 12, 2018, across the United States and throughout the world, pa-tients, plasma donors and plasma collection centers will join together to observe Inter-national Plasma Awareness Week (IPAW). There will be events to raise global awareness of the crucial need for plasma to create life-saving therapies, recognize that plasma do-nors contribute greatly in saving and improving lives, and increase understanding of the many rare diseases and plasma protein therapies that help to treat them. Plasma-derived therapies and recombinant blood clotting factors, collectively known as plasma protein therapies, are unique, biologic medicines that are either infused or injected to treat a variety of rare, life-threatening, chronic, and genetic diseases including bleeding dis-orders, hereditary angioedema, immune defi-ciencies, pulmonary disorders, neurological disorders, shock and trauma, liver cirrhosis, and infectious diseases such as tetanus, hep-atitis, and rabies. Plasma-derived therapies save and improve lives of individuals throughout the world, in-cluding in emergency and surgical medicine. Plasma protein therapies have significantly im-proved the quality of life, markedly improved patient outcomes, and extended the life ex-pectancy of individuals with rare, chronic dis-eases and conditions. Healthy, committed donors provide the plas-ma essential to manufacture these lifesaving therapies; and there are now approximately 700 plasma collection centers in the U.S. that have demonstrated their commitment to plas-ma donor and patient safety and quality by earning International Quality Plasma Program (IQPP) certification. I ask that my colleagues in the House of Representatives join me and rise in com-memoration of International Plasma Aware-ness Week, honoring those committed donors and collection centers who make and collect needed and lifesaving contributions.

TRIBUTE CELEBRATING THE 150TH ANNIVERSARY OF ST. JOHN AF-RICAN METHODIST EPISCOPAL CHURCH 
HON. JAMES E. CLYBURN 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 9, 2018 Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor St. John African Methodist Episcopal Church of Cottageville, South Carolina, on the occasion of its 150th anniversary celebration on the weekend of September 14th–16th, 2018. The journey that has brought St. John A.M.E. Church to this moment began in 1868 when the Church, originally named St. Mat-thew A.M.E., was established in the Burr Hill community under a bush arbor. Responding to the need for a more secure structure, the Reverend James Nesbitt and the officials of the Charleston District, with the as-sistance of the Church’s founding fathers, or-ganized the building of a church constructed of lightwood boards, heated by a potbelly stove, and illuminated by kerosene lamps. The Church served members from several different communities and was the site for a public school. In 1912, the Church was relocated to a par-cel of land more central to the communities it served both in Burr Hill and Mack Village. The area is now known as Griffith Acres Drive in Cottageville, South Carolina. St. John A.M.E.’s present facility was erected in 1975 where the Church continued to flourish and where, with the help of a supportive membership, a Fel-lowship Hall was constructed to serve as a dining facility and hub for entertainment and educational activities. Since its inception, St. John African Meth-odist Episcopal Church and its congregation have acted as a beacon of light within the community. The programs and ministries initi-ated by the Church have served as models for A.M.E. churches in the area and for other de-nominations as well. St. John A.M.E. con-tinues to positively impact the residents of Cottageville, a small town west of Charleston in Colleton County, through community-ori-ented programs, including: summer math and reading camps, church school, vacation bible school, revivals, bible study, and creative and performing arts. Always striving to serve God and the com-munity in new and innovative ways, St. John has piloted a new program called ‘‘The Iron Sharpeners’’ to encourage young African- American men to pursue internship opportuni-ties and has planted a new community garden which has produced a fresh harvest available to members, free of charge. Despite the uncertain and adverse climate in which St. John African Methodist Episcopal Church was planted, the strength of spirit and faith has allowed the Church to blossom and thrive through the years. St. John exemplifies what it means to be ‘‘rooted in faith’’ and is a place that people of various geographic loca-tions and stations in life still refer to as ‘‘home.’’ It is my great honor to pay tribute to this fine congregation. I ask my colleagues in the United States House of Representatives to join me in congratulating St. John African Methodist Episcopal Church on their 150th an-niversary and wishing them continued strength and prosperity in the days ahead. f 
SALUTING BILL AND SUE WELSER FOR THEIR DEDICATION TO OUR NATION’S VETERANS 
HON. BILL POSEY 
OF FLORIDA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 9, 2018 Mr. POSEY. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a moment to recognize Bill and Sue Welser for their leadership in the Space Coast Honor Flight program, which serves Florida’s Brevard and Indian River County veterans. Space Coast Honor Flight is a non-profit or-ganization that honors our World War II, Ko-rean War, and Vietnam War veterans by tak-ing them to visit their war memorials in Wash-ington, D.C. A retired U.S. Air Force Lieutenant General, Bill first became involved with the Honor Flight Network when he volunteered to serve as a guardian for a WWII veteran on the local chapter’s second flight. This moving experi-ence led Bill to work with a small cadre of vol-unteers to develop and run what would even-tually become Space Coast Honor Flight. Bill has served as the president of the organiza-tion for more than eight years. Seeing the profound impact that Space Coast Honor Flight has had on our veterans, Bill’s wife, Sue, joined the board and quickly became an integral part of all its activities. Sue serves as one of the veteran coordinators for the organization and is responsible for helping to create honor flight experiences for hundreds of veterans. Bill and Sue have also tirelessly given their time to organizing Space Coast orientations, flight departure ceremonies, veterans’ re-unions, and luncheons across the Space and Treasure Coasts. They have spent countless hours visiting our veterans in nursing homes and hospitals. They have attended a number of funeral services for our veteran heroes— Space Coast Honor Flight is often the first to be called when our veteran families lose a loved one. For the past eight years, Bill and Sue have been responsible for organizing, scheduling, and leading 52 flights, allowing 1,375 veterans to spend time at their war memorials in Wash-ington, D.C. Bill has pat1icipated in every sin-gle flight. One of the greatest privileges Katie and I have is greeting our veterans as they depart on their honor flight to our nation’s capital or greeting them in Washington, D.C. as they ar-rive on the National Mall to visit their memo-rials. Our veterans’ courage and service to the country has helped change the course of his-tory and has protected America and the free-doms we hold dear. Hosting these honor flights is the least we can do to acknowledge their service, and I am thankful for the work that Bill and Sue have done to make these flights possible. I ask my colleagues in the U.S. House of Representatives to join me in saluting the pas-sion, dedication, and commitment of Bill and Sue Welser. Their efforts and service honors our veterans each and every day and has been vital to the success of the Space Coast Honor Flight mission. f

Upon his return home to Colorado, he, along with his brother, turned Robinson Dairy into a nationally regarded business. After sell-ing it in 1999, Dick Robinson became the Co- Founder of the Dean Foods Denver operation. Throughout his successful business career, he has also taken on many additional responsibil-ities. These have included, serving as the chair of charities such as the Milk Processor’s Education Program, the Denver Area Council Boy Scouts of America, the Greater Denver Chamber of Commerce, the Rose Community Foundation as well as many other organiza-tions to better our community. Some of his other commitments include the boards of the Denver Art Museum, HCA-HealthONE, and Regis University. Dick Robinson’s spirit of service is invalu-able in the Denver Metro area where he has been so active, and it is in the spirit of this service that he is celebrated by the Crohn’s and Colitis Foundation Distinction Award.
