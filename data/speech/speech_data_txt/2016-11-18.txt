REMEMBERING THE LATE HONORABLE STEVE L
ATOURETTE 
SPEECH OF  
HON. RODNEY P. FRELINGHUYSEN 
OF NEW JERSEY  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, November 14, 2016 Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, on Au-gust 2nd, the House of Representatives lost a bit of its humanity with the passing of our friend and former colleague Steve LaTourette. Steve’s life was a life lived well and lived fully. It brought to mind that old adage, ‘‘In the end, it’s not the years in your life that count. It’s the life in your years.’’ There certainly was a lot of life in Steve LaTourette’s years. Simply put, he was a great member—re-spected and admired. He served for eighteen years in this House, and in doing so, made this chamber a more effective, more respon-sible and more compassionate body. He cared deeply about this institution and recognized that we all—Republicans and Democrats—were sent here to find solutions to tackle the nation’s challenges. The headline on his obituary in the ‘‘New York Times’’ of August 4 referred to him as ‘‘Congressman Who Despised Gridlock.’’ In his daily battle to get things done for the peo-ple of Ohio and the United States, he was never reluctant to reach across the aisle to find a path forward. Personally, Steve was more than a class-mate, a fellow appropriator and colleague. He was a great friend. I found him bright, thought-ful and incredibly hardworking. And his keen sense of humor could lighten any situation. I think often of Steve and his wife, Jennifer, and also of his children Emma, Henry, Sarah, Sam, Clare and Amy. I hope they will be com-forted in the knowledge that Steve LaTourette, above all, always strived to do what he thought was the right thing, no matter the cir-cumstances, obstacles or consequences. That is the definition of courage. Moreover, that is the essence of service. Steve’s passing is a tremendous loss for all of us and for the state of Ohio. Of course, the loss is most acute for his family but also by the colleagues he left behind in this House. He will not be forgotten.

IN RECOGNITION OF CHIEF RANDY M. SOBEL 
HON. FRANK C. GUINTA 
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 18, 2016 Mr. GUINTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recog-nize the public service of Chief Randy M. Sobel of the Middleton Police Department. Chief Sobel retired on October 31, 2016 after twenty-seven years of law enforcement serv-ice to the people of Strafford County in New Hampshire. Chief Sobel began his law enforcement ca-reer in 1989 with the Milton Police Department and followed that with four years’ service with the Farmington Police Department. However, it is his twenty-two-year career in Middleton that is most noteworthy, having served as Chief of the Middleton Police Department since 2002. Throughout his career, he per-formed his duties without great public recogni-tion yet he was always a well-respected and admired member of the communities he rep-resented. On behalf of the people of the First Congressional District, I thank him for his ca-reer dedicated to public safety and wish him a long and happy retirement. f 
HONORING THE 10TH ANNIVER-SARY OF THE AMERICAN CAN-YON FAMILY RESOURCE CENTER 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 18, 2016 Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the American Canyon Family Resource Center which is celebrating its 10th Anniversary of offering support and re-sources to the families, children, and seniors of our community. The American Canyon Family Resource Center opened in April 2006 with the mission to strengthen our community, embrace diver-sity, and promote and provide local services. The Center has made childcare, housing, legal aid, tax assistance, education, and immigra-tion resources available to every resident of American Canyon, California. The American Canyon Family Resource Center provides families with tools to help themselves. The Center looks at the strengths of the people they serve and helps them to build upon those strengths to create better and healthier situations for their families. The Center acts as an integrated service system to connect families with nonprofit organizations and government agencies to establish a sup-port system which secures our community’s families. In addition to connecting families to outside community resources, the Center hosts work-shops and classes with topics on establishing credit, buying a home, and securing employ-ment, giving community members confidence, knowledge, and training to provide for their families. The American Canyon Resource Center’s financial coaching service focuses on helping our community members increase in-come, manage credit, and build assets by pro-viding training and job placement, helping indi-viduals create a budget and manage credit, and introducing them to matched savings ac-counts and first-time home buyer programs. The Center helps families get back on their feet and take control of their own futures. Mr. Speaker, for a decade this institution has been instrumental in shaping the families in our community and promoting a sense of belonging and safety for children, families, and seniors. Therefore, it is fitting and proper that we honor the American Canyon Family Re-source Center here today. f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF MR. CHARLES R. NEWMAN 
HON. CHRIS COLLINS 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 18, 2016 Mr. COLLINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor the memory of a distinguished member of New York’s 27th District. Mr. Charles R. Newman of Arcade, New York, passed away November 12, 2016. Charles was born in Buffalo, New York on October 6, 1925. He attended St. Bonaventure University with a major in Accounting and Pre- Law while also participating in the Army Re-serves. He served in the United States Army as a First Lieutenant from 1943 to 1946 during World War II, and for his bravery and patriot-ism Charles was awarded the WWII Victory Medal, the Army Occupation Medal, and the Army Commendation Ribbon. After his years of service, Charles returned to Western New York to graduate from Buffalo Law School in 1950. Charles went on to practice law in Ar-cade for twenty-seven years before serving as Arcade Village Justice, Town of Arcade Jus-tice, Wyoming County Attorney, and eventually Wyoming County Court Judge for many years. Charles was a community leader and was dedicated to helping the young men and women of our community. He was a Boy Scout leader and sat on the Board of Directors for the Genesee County Boy Scouts, an orga-nization vital in helping many young men reach their full potential. Charles also served as Clerk to the Arcade Central and Pioneer Central School boards. Charles also contributed to the Arcade com-munity by serving as board member of the AJ Odell Medical Foundation, a member of the Arcade Chamber of Commerce, President of the New York State Magistrates Association, Member of the Free-Masons for over 63 years, and Member of the American legion for over 68 years. Charles was an important and loved member of the town of Arcade that left a deep impression on everyone he met. I had the privilege to meet and honor Charles as New York 27th’s Congressional District Veteran of the Month—fittingly this Veterans Day. Dozens of members of the Vet-erans of Foreign Wars and American Legion attended the ceremony, and I was despondent to hear of his passing the following day. After many years of service to his community, I would like to again recognize this American patriot.

OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 18, 2016 Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Speaker, today I com-memorate the 100th Anniversary of Glenbard Township High School District 87. On Novem-ber 26th, District 87 will celebrate its centen-nial, representing 100 years of dedication to academic excellence and student success. Glenbard Township High School District 87 was first established in 1916 in the second floor of the DuPage bank building. At that time, the school consisted of 120 students and 5 facility members. Fast forward one hundred years and District 87 is still based in Glen Ellyn but now consists of Glenbard South, Glenbard North, Glenbard East, and Glenbard West high schools. It is now the third largest school district in the state and is known for its fantastic academic achievement. I applaud District 87’s commitment to its ex-cellent teachers, who have consistently chal-lenged their students to achieve high stand-ards and follow their dreams. District 87 schools have helped students consistently succeed at rigorous academic levels while in-stilling the values of community, kindness, re-spect, hard work, and love of learning. On this special occasion, we recognize Dis-trict 87’s rich history of academic excellence. We thank the District for its partnership with parents, who strive to educate the current generation that will become our nation’s future leaders. For well over a century, Glenbard Township High Schools have contributed to-ward this brighter future. Mr. Speaker and Distinguished Colleagues, please join me in honoring the legacy of Glenbard Township High School District 87, and in wishing them continued success.

TRIBUTE TO JACK H. BROWN 
HON. PETE AGUILAR 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 18, 2016 Mr. AGUILAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of both myself and Representative K
ENCAL-
VERT from Riverside County to honor and pay tribute to the remarkable Jack H. Brown who passed away on Sunday, November 13, 2016. Jack was a pillar of the community in the In-land Empire, California, and he will be deeply missed. A native of San Bernardino, California, Jack began his career in the grocery business as a box boy at Berk’s Market Spot in San Bernardino when he was just thirteen years old. In 1981, Jack was hired by Stater Bros. Markets, where he would serve as President and Chief Executive Officer for over thirty-five years and as Chairman for over thirty years. Jack’s leadership and wisdom allowed Stater Bros. Markets to become Southern California’s largest privately-owned supermarket chain, and as of 2015, the Inland Empire’s largest private employer. During the Vietnam War era, Jack proudly served his nation in the Navy and as a sailor in the Pacific Fleet. In the years after his mili-tary service, Jack would become a strong sup-porter of our armed forces and our nation’s veterans. In recognition of his support and the many contributions of Stater Bros., Jack re-ceived the ‘‘Friend of the Veteran Award’’ from the Riverside National Cemetery’s Veterans’ Advisory Committee as well as the Congres-sional Medal of Honor Society’s highest honor, the ‘‘Patriot Award.’’ He was also a recipient of the prestigious Horatio Alger Award in honor of his efforts to fulfill the ‘‘American Dream’’ and for his contributions to our nation. Jack is survived by his wife Debbie, three beloved daughters: J. Kathleen Smith (Michael Smith), Cara Hoffman (Scott Hoffman) and Melissa Koss (Pete Koss). He had seven grand-children, Kaitlyn, Colleen, Caden, Dylan, Julianna, Jack Ryan and Emma. Jack’s life serves as an inspiration to all of us, reminding us that a strong work ethic and a dedication to serving others can lead to a lifetime of happiness and fulfillment. His com-mitment to our country and community, as well as his love for his family and work, has ce-mented his legacy as a true leader in our re-gion. We are honored to have been able to call Jack a friend, and we will always miss him. Our hearts go out to Jack’s friends and family as they navigate this loss, but we know they may take comfort in the fact that the posi-tive impacts he made on our community will be felt by generations to come. f

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 18, 2016 Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, on November 17, 2016, I missed three recorded votes on the House floor due to a family event. I ask that the R

TRIBUTE TO THE HONOR FLIGHT OF OREGON 
HON. GREG WALDEN 
OF OREGON  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 18, 2016 Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recog-nize the seven World War II veterans and six Korean War veterans from Oregon who visited their memorial on the National Mall on Satur-day, October 8, 2016 through Honor Flight of Oregon. Every time I have the chance to meet one of these heroes from the ‘‘Greatest Gen-eration,’’ I am reminded of the poignant words of General Dwight D. Eisenhower. In a mes-sage to Allied troops just before D–Day, he said, ‘‘The eyes of the world are upon you. The hopes and prayers of liberty loving people everywhere march with you.’’ He was right then, of course, Mr. Speaker. But over 70 years later, liberty loving people everywhere continue to owe these heroes for their extraordinary service and their incredible stories of sacrifice and bravery on behalf of our country. That’s why it is my privilege to enter their names into the CONGRESSIONAL  R
ECORD today. The veterans on this Honor Flight from Or-egon are as follows: Shirley Boehmer, Army; Arnold Ebert, Army; Gordon Nelson, Army; John Hull, Marine Corps; Clarence Kelm, Ma-rine Corps; Albert Pule, Marine Corps; Bruce Pence, Marine Corps; James Estep, Navy; William Isely, Navy; Johnny Johnson, Navy; Wilma Norris, Navy; Marvin Stuber, Navy; and Helen Watson, Navy. These 13 heroes join the over 150,000 vet-erans who have been honored through the Honor Flight Network of volunteers nationwide since 2005. I would also like to recognize the three guardians traveling on this trip who have also served our country: Jeffrey Hull, Army; Rose-mary Agee, Navy; and Terry Haines, Navy. Terry served Oregon’s Second District for many years as our veterans outreach liaison, and has always been a strong advocate for the men and women who have worn the uni-form. I also want to thank and recognize Janet Yakopatz and Rita ‘‘Sam’’ Boyd, the group leaders on this flight, as well as the dedicated Board Members of Honor Flight of Oregon, who worked so hard to make this trip happen. And, of course, none of this would be pos-sible without Gail Yakopatz, the longtime President of Honor Flight of Southern Oregon. Gail is one of a kind. For many years, she has been a tireless advocate for Oregon’s vet-erans, and I am proud to call her my friend. Mr. Speaker, at the height of the Civil War in 1863, President Abraham Lincoln wrote, ‘‘Honor to the Soldier, and Sailor everywhere, who bravely bears his country’s cause.’’ Each of us in this Chamber and in this nation should be humbled by the courage of these brave veterans who put themselves in harm’s way for our country and way of life. As a nation, we can never fully repay the debt of gratitude owed to them for their honor, commitment, and sacrifice in defense of the freedoms we have today. My colleagues, please join me in thanking these veterans and the volunteers of Honor Flight of Oregon for their exemplary dedication and service to this great country.

OF OREGON  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 18, 2016 Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, had I been present for today’s votes on the amend-ments to H.R. 5982, I would have voted ‘‘yea’’ on the Conyers Amendment (Roll no. 581), ‘‘yea’’ on the Jackson-Lee Amendment (Roll no. 582), and ‘‘yea’’ on the Connolly En Bloc Amendment (Roll no. 583). I would have also voted ‘‘yea’’ on the Democratic Motion to Re-commit (Roll no. 584), which would add an ex-emption to the underlying bill for any rule that pertains to improving employment, job reten-tion, or the quality of the workforce. I would have voted ‘‘nay’’ on the final pas-sage of H.R. 5982 (Roll no. 585). Should it be-come law, H.R. 5982 would amend the Con-gressional Review Act (CRA) to allow for the en bloc disapproval of all regulations finalized near the end of presidential terms, jeopard-izing important public protections affecting public health, safety, and the environment.

Had I been present for the vote on the Democratic Motion to Recommit H.R. 5711 (Roll no. 586), which would have prohibited the Secretary of the Treasury from authorizing a transaction by any U.S. financial institution engaged in business with a foreign entity that has been found to have engaged in or author-ized cyber-attacks targeting any election held in the United States, I would have voted ‘‘yea’’. Additionally, had I been present for the vote on Final Passage of H.R. 5711 (Roll no. 587), a bill to prohibit the Secretary of the Treasury from authorizing certain transactions by a U.S. financial institution in connection with the ex-port or re-export of a commercial passenger aircraft to the Islamic Republic of Iran, I would have voted ‘‘nay.’’ I oppose H.R. 5711, which would undermine the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the agreement reached be-tween Iran, the United States and five other countries designed to force Iran to back away from the nuclear threshold. I celebrate the agreement—that Iran is complying, that the U.S. can benefit, and that we have an oppor-tunity to strengthen ties with a former enemy.

IN HONOR OF BILL STANFILL 
HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR. 
OF GEORGIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 18, 2016 Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart and solemn remembrance that I pay tribute to an outstanding athlete, businessman, and citizen, William Thomas ‘‘Bill’’ Stanfill, Sr. Sadly, Bill passed away on Thursday, November 10, 2016. A memorial service was held on Monday, November 14, 2016 at Albany First United Methodist Church in Albany, Georgia. A Georgia man through and through, Bill Stanfill was born in Cairo, Georgia. According to him, growing up on a farm doing farm work helped prepare him to play football. While at Cairo High School, Bill was selected as the Class Double-A Lineman of the Year. He also led the basketball team to the state champion-ship and was named MVP of the state tour-nament. As if that were not enough, Bill ex-celled in track and field, earning three state Double-A discus championships and a shot put title. Afters high school, Bill attended the Univer-sity of Georgia on a football scholarship. He was in the first recruiting class of legendary UGA football coach, Vince Dooley. As a de-fensive tackle for the Georgia Bulldogs, he played on two SEC championship teams in 1966 and 1968. In 1968, he was elected per-manent team captain, was a consensus All- American, and became Georgia’s first and only winner of the Outland Trophy, which is awarded annually to the best college football interior lineman in the country. Bill was drafted in the first round with the eleventh overall pick by the Miami Dolphins in the 1969 draft. That year, he was named AFL Rookie of the Year runner up. In 1972, he was the leader of the ‘‘No-Name Defense’’ on the undefeated Miami Dolphins team that went on to win the Super Bowl. He was also the start-ing defensive end on the Dolphins’ 1973 Super Bowl team. That year, he recorded 18 18
1⁄2sacks, a single season Dolphins record that still stands today. His career sack total stands at 671⁄2, which places him among the greatest Dolphins pass rushers of all time. He was a four-time Pro Bowler in his eight-year career with Miami. After suffering numerous injuries, Bill retired from football but unfortunately, those injuries followed him for the rest of his life. Neverthe-less, Bill always remained close to the sport and his former teammates. He was inducted into the Miami Dolphins’ Honor Roll, the Geor-gia Sports Hall of Fame, and the UGA Circle of Honor. Bill followed his NFL career with a success-ful business career with Dozier-Stanfill Real Estate Company in Albany, Georgia. He was a member of the First United Methodist Church of Albany and served as the Sec-retary/Treasurer of the Monk Thompson Sun-day School Class. Bill is survived by his wife, Gail; four chil-dren, Stan, Jake, Kristin, and Scott; five grandchildren, Cole, Jack, Samuel, Grace, and Luke; two sisters, Beth and Tommie; and nu-merous nieces and nephews. Mr. Speaker, my wife Vivian and I, along with the more than 730,000 residents of the Second Congressional District of Georgia, sa-lute Bill Stanfill for his drive, perseverance, and dedication, which contributed to the long list of accomplishments still remembered and admired by many today. I ask my colleagues in the House of Representatives to join us in extending our deepest condolences to Bill Stanfill’s family and friends during this difficult time. We pray that they will be consoled and comforted by an abiding faith and the Holy Spirit in the days, weeks and months ahead.
