May Your Holy Spirit bring them new life and hope, making them equal to their experi-ences and responsibilities. Lord, lead them on the upward way to a higher plane of unity and peace as they strive to hold aloft Your banners of truth, justice, and love. Lord, we will continue to rejoice in You, for You are the God of our salva-tion. We pray in Your Holy Name. Amen.

REMEMBERING ZELL MILLER AND DANIEL AKAKA Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, I would like to begin with a few words of tribute to two retired colleagues who passed away since we were last to-gether. On Friday, March 23, former Senator Zell Miller departed this life at the age

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES1994 April 9, 2018 
of 86. Those of us who served with Zell knew him as a kind and honorable man and a committed public servant. He rose from a childhood without electricity and running water well into his school years to serve the State of Georgia as Governor and later as Sen-ator. Zell Miller did so with grit and determination, never afraid to buck partisanship in favor of his principles. Also, this past Thursday, Senator Daniel Akaka, our former colleague from Hawaii, passed away at the age of 93. He worked closely with Senator Inouye and others to advocate for his State. As the Senator himself once put it, he always preferred being a work-horse to a show horse. The Senate offers our condolences to their families. 
f 
WELCOMING SENATOR HYDE- SMITH Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, on an entirely different matter, we just welcomed a new colleague to this Chamber today. Senator C
INDY HYDE- S
MITH was sworn in. She became the 51st Senator and the first woman to represent Mississippi here in the Sen-ate. Senator H
YDE-SMITH brings experi-ence as a State legislator and as the Mississippi commissioner of agri-culture and commerce. I know I speak for all Senators on both sides of the aisle in welcoming our new colleague. We look forward to working together and continuing this record of accomplishment for the American people. 
f 
NOMINATIONS Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, on another matter, this week the Senate will turn to one of its most important constitutional responsibilities, the per-sonnel business. We have a number of nominees to consider in the next sev-eral days. First is Claria Horn Boom, President Trump’s pick to serve as a Federal dis-trict judge for both the Eastern and Western Districts of Kentucky. Through her work in both the public and private sectors, Ms. Boom has dis-tinguished herself as a problem-solver, a trusted adviser to clients and her community. Letters in support of her nomination share a theme: She has the skills and experiences to excel as a district judge. ‘‘High standards, ample preparation, and a fears intellect’’; ‘‘unfailingly thoughtful, gracious, and diligent’’— these are just some of the ways Ms. Boom is described by those she served and worked with in Kentucky. The Ju-diciary Committee came to the same conclusion, advancing her nomination on a voice vote. Later today the full Senate will vote to advance this talented and non-controversial nominee, and then I hope we will be able to quickly confirm her. Then, in the coming days, we will consider several more judges and im-portant nominees for the Department of Labor, the EPA, and the National Labor Relations Board. These and many other positions remain vacant nearly a year and a half into the Trump administration. Qualified nominees stand ready, but Senate Democrats are using the proce-dural playbook to obstruct and delay. In many cases, for example, they are insisting that the Senate exhaust postcloture time even on unobjectionable district court nomi-nees who have gone on to over-whelming confirmation—for examples, Walter Counts, who was confirmed 96 to 0, or Karen Gren Scholer, who was confirmed 95 to 0. I will have more to say on these par-tisan tactics in the coming days. For now, let me make one thing clear. The Senate’s workweek will not end—will not end—until all of these amply quali-fied nominees are confirmed. f 
TAX REFORM Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, now on one final matter, there is just one more week until the deadline for Amer-icans to file our 2017 tax returns. It is not exactly a national holiday, but this year there is a silver lining. This April is the last time Americans will file taxes under the old, outdated Tax Code that is on its way out, thanks to his-toric tax reform. A year from now, families will be fil-ing under a simpler and fairer tax code that lets them keep more of what they have earned and send less to the IRS. They will benefit from a doubled stand-ard deduction, from major expansions in key provisions like the child tax credit, and, of course, from signifi-cantly lower tax rates. All told, the average family of four earning a median income of around $70,000 could see a tax cut of over $2,000. But let’s remember, the American peo-ple do not need to wait until next year to start seeing the fruits of once-in-a- generation tax reform. Job creators are already imple-menting plans to hire, expand, and in-vest in their American workers. Mil-lions of workers have already received word of a tax reform bonus, permanent raise, or other new benefits, such as paid family leave policies or expanded retirement assistance. That includes thousands of employees of Southwire, a wire manufacturer that employs hun-dreds of Kentuckians at its location in Hawesville. For hard-working men and women at Southwire, tax reform means bonuses and expanded educational op-portunities. The benefits of our new 21st century Tax Code are certainly no secret. As Americans put the finishing touches on their tax returns under the old, out-dated system for the last time, there is good news to look forward to, and there is good news that is actually al-ready here. MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR—S. 2629 AND H.R. 5247 Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I understand there are two bills at the desk due for a second reading en bloc. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The lead-er is correct. The clerk will read the bills by title for the second time. The legislative clerk read as follows: 
A bill (S. 2629) to improve postal oper-ations, service, and transparency. A bill (H.R. 5247) to authorize the use of el-igible investigational drugs by eligible pa-tients who have been diagnosed with a stage of a disease or condition in which there is reasonable likelihood that death will occur within a matter of months, or with another eligible illness, and for other purposes. 
Mr. M CCONNELL. In order to place the bills on the calendar under the pro-visions of rule XIV, I object to further proceedings en bloc. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-tion having been heard, the bills will be placed on the calendar. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized. 
f 
WELCOMING SENATOR HYDE- SMITH Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first, let me welcome back my fellow Sen-ators after a productive State work pe-riod. Let me welcome our newest Sen-ator, C
INDY HYDE-SMITH, the junior Senator from Mississippi. She is the first woman to represent the State of Mississippi, and I welcome her warmly to this Chamber. 
f 
REMEMBERING DANNY AKAKA Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, over the past weeks, as we have been away, we have heard of the passing of two of our Senators: Zell Miller and Danny Akaka. I would like to say a few words about Danny Akaka, who was a good friend of mine. In everything he did, he was a soldier, a teacher, and a statesman. He embodied the spirit of Hawaii. He was so sincere in his beliefs and such a kind and gentle man that Senators went out of their way to help him and, of course, he fought so hard for his State. He taught us so much in his modesty, in his persistence, and in his love of his constituents. So for all he taught us, for his service and for his friendship, we say ‘‘mahalo’’ one final time. 
f 
CONGRATULATING SENATOR DUCKWORTH Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, it was T

UCKWORTH ’s child. It is a milestone. T
AMMY DUCKWORTH , a few hours ago, became the first Senator to give birth while in office. We are very glad to hear that she and her newborn daugh-ter are happy and healthy. 
f 
COMMONSENSE VALUES Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, like all of my colleagues, I spent the past few weeks crisscrossing my State meeting with constituents. I am al-ways struck by their commonsense val-ues. Folks want to be able to afford quality healthcare. That is probably their greatest worry. They know healthcare is so vital to them and for families. They know costs keep going up. They are worried about premiums, especially after the Republican Con-gress has done so much to sabotage our healthcare system; talking about tear-ing down the healthcare system but never building it up in any way. Folks also want a good job with de-cent benefits and higher wages, but they are not seeing much of that in the wake of the Republican tax bill. In fact, many of them are disappointed that they are not receiving more. They are seeing corporations buy back a lot of their stock, which boosts compensa-tion for executives and shareholders, but they don’t see that much of a bump in their paychecks. The bottom line is, they are asking: Why are the wealthy getting so much more money in the tax break than we are? I have heard that from one end of my State to the other. Another problem: folks want to be able to send their kids to school and know they will be safe. I talked to one mom whose daughter just doesn’t want to go to school after what happened in Parkland. She is afraid. She is 7 years old. A few weeks ago, I marched with hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers in the March For Our Lives. Their en-ergy and optimism and dedication give me hope that finally the time has come for Congress to take meaningful action on gun safety. Another example where our Repub-lican colleagues who run this Senate haven’t done enough—not close to enough—is on the issue of gun safety. On these issues and more, the Repub-lican majority has done very little. What they have done has been on be-half of entrenched special interests: tax cuts for corporations and the super-wealthy, gutting healthcare to pay for more tax cuts, and holding back on commonsense gun safety laws like uni-versal gun safety checks because the NRA opposes it. The American people are fed up with large, special, and powerful interests getting their way, while average folks get left behind. That is what I heard while traveling my State. In November, the American people will have a chance to move this coun-try in a dramatically different direc-tion, away from the corporate special interest-driven politics, away from the swamp—I will talk more about that later, but President Trump has made it worse, despite claims that he is making it better—and toward politics that work for the middle class and those struggling to get there. The enthu-siasm among so many Americans—not just core Democrats but others—of going to the polls and making their voices heard because they want a change in direction in this country was heartening and strengthening to me. The Democratic Senate minority is working to get away from those special interest politics. That is what a Demo-cratic majority will deliver if elected in November. 
f 
NOMINATION OF ANDREW WHEELER Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, this week the Senate will consider several nominations, including the nomination of Andrew Wheeler to be Deputy Ad-ministrator at the Environmental Pro-tection Agency. Mr. Wheeler—not atypical of this administration, not atypical of the dense swamp that they have made a whole lot worse—is, what else, an industry lobbyist who has worked on behalf of big polluters and climate change deniers. He spent years working to undermine or lobby against environmental protections he may soon oversee. As a lobbyist, he helped raise money for a few Republican Sen-ators who sit on the committee that recently approved his nomination. Swamp, President Trump? You are cre-ating it; you are making it a lot worse. Wheeler’s nomination fits the pat-tern in the Trump administration of nominating industry lobbyists to lead agencies that are supposed to be a watchdog over those very industries. The nerve it takes for President Trump and his allies to preach ‘‘drain the swamp’’ after all the President has done to fill the swamp since coming to Washington. His Cabinet is filled with multimillionaires, hedge fund man-agers, corporate executives, and former lobbyists with sprawling conflicts of interest. Mr. Wheeler is only the latest in a long line of swamp nominees. I will be opposing his nomination. 
f 
EPA ADMINISTRATOR PRUITT Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, the Wheeler nomination sheds even more light on the current storm surrounding EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt. If there was ever somebody who charac-terizes the swamp, it is Scott Pruitt, and all Americans should believe that, regardless of your views on the envi-ronment or whether wind or solar or natural gas or oil or coal is the right form of energy. What Pruitt is doing is just incred-ible. In a relatively brief tenure at EPA, he has amassed an embarrassing list of scandals. He has ordered the construction of an expensive sound-proof office at the EPA for reasons un-known, when none of his predecessors, Democratic or Republican, saw any need for such a facility. He has typi-cally flown coach when paying for trav-el out of his own pocket but elected to fly first class when the taxpayers foot the bill. After moving to Washington, Administrator Pruitt rented an apart-ment for a cutrate price from—guess who—an energy lobbyist and former campaign donor who represents mul-tiple clients with businesses before the EPA during Pruitt’s tenure. The level of hypocrisy in this admin-istration is staggering. President Trump says he is going to drain the swamp. Pruitt characterizes the swamp in just about all of his actions, and Trump sticks by him. If you want to drain the swamp, Mr. President, get rid of Mr. Pruitt. Unfortunately, President Trump has stood by Pruitt, despite obvious abuses of the taxpayers’ money and trust. Why? Well, he likes what he is doing to unwind critical environmental protec-tions on behalf of powerful industries. The bottom line is simple. President Trump is so beholden to the special in-terests that supported Administrator Pruitt and his extreme, anti-green, in-dustry-driven agenda that he is willing to turn a blind eye to serious ethical problems. If Big Oil and Big Gas are happy with EPA Administrator Pruitt, so, it seems, is President Trump. In supporting Administrator Pruitt, President Trump is lowering the bar of government ethics and accountability to the floor. What abuse of the Amer-ican people’s trust will President Trump not tolerate if Administrator Pruitt is allowed to continue in his po-sition despite flagrant graft? How can the President, with a straight face, say he aims to drain the swamp when he al-lows a man like Pruitt to stay? How much will President Trump let the standards for ethical conduct in his ad-ministration deteriorate? I say to President Trump: The cor-ruption and incompetence of this ad-ministration has reached a fever pitch. President Trump, if you truly mean to drain the swamp—and it doesn’t seem that you do—you ought to fire Administrator Pruitt immediately. Ac-cept his resignation. Let him leave, which alone will clean up Washington in a way that Pruitt has not cleaned up our environment. 
f 
CBO REPORT Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, now, on the CBO report. Today CBO came out with a report that revised its projections of the def-icit, saying they have ‘‘increased markedly’’ since the Republican tax bill added about $1.9 trillion to the def-icit. By 2020, the annual deficit will surpass $1 trillion. It is a reminder of just how wrong the predictions were that the Repub-lican tax bill would somehow pay for itself. It is also a reminder of how un-concerned the current Republican Party is about deficits.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES1996 April 9, 2018 
When it comes to tax cuts for big cor-porations and the rich, deficits are no impediment, but now that these tax cuts are in place, I predict that deficits will once again morph into a dire prob-lem, a scourge on the Nation, an excuse for Republicans to target Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. That has been the playbook since the Bush era: explode the deficit with tax cuts for the rich and powerful, then use the deficit they created as a reason to cut Social Security and Medicare. Lo and behold, this week the major-ity in the House will vote on a bal-anced budget amendment—a way for Republicans to force cuts to Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security. It is hard to believe they can say it with a straight face, but we will hear Repub-lican Members say this week that Washington needs to get its fiscal House in order, only a few months after they added $1.5 trillion to the deficit by tax cuts that mainly benefited the wealthy and the powerful. It is the height of hypocrisy. The American people deserve better than this patronizing Kabuki theater. They deserve a Congress squarely fo-cused on helping the middle class, not the powerful, not the special interests, not those at the very top of the eco-nomic ladder. So far, this Republican Congress has shown it is not up to the job, and every day more and more Americans realize that. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Ms. HIRONO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. E

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Hawaii. Ms. HIRONO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to place a maile lei on the lectern dur-ing my remarks. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. REMEMBERING DANIEL KAHIKINA AKAKA  
Ms. HIRONO. Madam President, I rise today in remembrance of Senator Daniel Kahikina Akaka. Senator Akaka, who served in the Senate for 23 years and sat at this desk, passed away on Friday morning, with his wife of nearly 70 years, Millie, and his ex-tended family at his side. Since his passing, people across Ha-waii have shared their memories of and tributes to Senator Akaka. Each of their stories has a common thread— Senator Akaka’s dedication to living with ‘‘aloha.’’ Senator Akaka embodied the ‘‘aloha’’ spirit. From meeting near-ly every Hawaii family who came to his office for a Capitol tour to serving as a tireless advocate for veterans, the Na-tive Hawaiian community, and Hawaii families, Senator Akaka’s care, empa-thy, and compassion were evident to everyone who knew him. When I was elected to the Senate, I requested Senator Akaka’s desk to be my desk. I did this because it rep-resented continuity as Senator Akaka’s successor, and the desk is a symbol to me of his years of service and the ‘‘aloha’’ he had for this body and the people of Hawaii. The last time I saw Senator Akaka was at last year’s American Logistics Association Hawaii conference. This gathering brings together Hawaii busi-nesses from across the State to market their products for sale to military com-missaries. Over 20 years ago, Senator Akaka worked with small businesses and the military commissary network to create this conference because he understood how much receiving a com-missary contract would mean to Ha-waii’s businesses, especially Hawaii’s small businesses. The conference started with one small table with a few products and grew to an entire ballroom full of local products and entrepreneurs. Last year, the conference was named for Senator Akaka. That is who Senator Akaka was. He brought people together to solve prob-lems and create opportunities. His leg-islative style wasn’t flashy or over the top. He put his head down and got to work, and he built relationships with colleagues to get things done. Senator Akaka’s work on behalf of our Nation’s veterans also reflected his persistent, effective style. After serv-ing in World War II, Senator Akaka went to college under the GI bill and became an educator. As chairman of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Com-mittee, he was a strong advocate for expanding the GI bill for a new genera-tion of veterans. He authored the post- 9/11 GI bill, which was signed into law in 2011. Senator Akaka also championed the cause of the Filipino veterans of World War II in Congress. These veterans fought for the United States but were denied the benefits and citizenship they were promised. Senator Akaka in-troduced legislation that would restore these veterans’ benefits and, with his leadership, this bill passed the Senate. Later he and Senator Inouye success-fully included language in the 2009 stimulus bill that provided onetime payments for these Filipino veterans through the newly created Filipino Veterans Equity Compensation Fund. Senator Akaka also introduced bipar-tisan legislation to allow these vet-erans to reunite with their children and families in the United States. While this bill did not pass, President Obama established through executive order the Filipino World War II Vet-erans Parole Program in 2016 to allow the children of these veterans to re-unite with their parents in the United States. Some of these veterans have been waiting for decades to reunite with their children. Although Senator Akaka had retired, his insistence on bipartisanship helped to build broad support for President Obama’s decision to issue this Execu-tive order. Senator Akaka was also instru-mental in building support to award the Filipino Veterans of World War II the Congressional Gold Medal that passed in 2016, after years of continued effort. Senator Akaka was also a champion for America’s Native people and served as chairman of the Senate Indian Af-fairs Committee. As the first Native Hawaiian to serve in the U.S. Senate, Senator Akaka fought to expand fund-ing for Native Hawaiian healthcare, education, and housing programs. In 1993, President Clinton signed into law Senator Akaka’s apology resolu-tion, which acknowledged the Federal Government’s role in the overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom in 1893. The res-olution’s unanimous passage marked the 100th anniversary of the overthrow and was a watershed moment for Na-tive Hawaiians. It served as the first official admission by the United States of the role it played in the overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom. Senator Akaka later worked on the Hawaiian Home Lands Recovery Act. This law required the United States to make the Hawaiian homelands whole by ensuring a repayment of lost use of lands originally set aside by Congress but which were nevertheless trans-ferred to or otherwise acquired by the Federal Government. The apology resolution and the Lands Recovery Act provided the foun-dation for Senator Akaka’s namesake legislation—the Native Hawaiian Gov-ernment Reorganization Act, often re-ferred to as the Akaka bill, to establish a process to secure Federal recognition for Native Hawaiians to achieve parity with the Alaska Natives and American Indians. When I served in the House of Rep-resentatives, I introduced the House companion to the Akaka bill and testi-fied about the importance of passing this legislation in both the U.S. House and the U.S. Senate. Senator Akaka re-introduced the Akaka bill for more than 10 years, but it did not pass before he retired.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S1997 April 9, 2018 
A former longtime Akaka staff mem-ber reflected on the Senator’s commit-ment to the Native Hawaiian commu-nity. She said: 
Senator Akaka worked tirelessly to ad-dress the longstanding issues resulting from the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii. He felt strongly that there needed to be a proc-ess to bring all parties to the table because without such a process these issues remained festering sources of emotional pain that would stand in the way of Hawaii being able to move forward as a state and for Native Hawaiians to move forward as indigenous peoples. 
Building on his work, in 2016, the De-partment of the Interior adopted rules creating a process that could reestab-lish a government-to-government rela-tionship between the United States and Native Hawaiians. While the Native Hawaiian community has differences on the issue of Federal recognition, ev-eryone can agree that Senator Akaka pushed for the passage of the Akaka bill because he wanted equity and jus-tice for Native Hawaiian people. Senator Akaka’s advocacy for our country’s Native people could best be summarized in his own words during his farewell address to the Senate, where he said: 
The United States is a great country. One of the things that makes us so great is that though we have made mistakes, we change, we correct them, we right past wrongs. It is our responsibility as a nation to do right by America’s native people, those who exercised sovereignty on lands that later became part of the United States. While we can never change the past, we have the power to change the future. 
Many people also may not know that Senator Akaka was just as committed to protecting Hawaii’s land and water resources as he was to improving the lives of Hawaii’s people. In 1992, Sen-ator Akaka successfully passed his Tropical Forest Recovery Act into law, which served as a basis for Federal con-servation efforts that protect Hawaii’s plants and forests. As with so many of his initiatives, the Senator was much ahead of his time. This act provided a vision and blueprint for tomorrow’s conservation ethic, one that stressed the integration of ecology, livelihoods, and culture; in short, an ethic that emphasized sacred relationship between people and place, community and sustainably managed resources. Senator Akaka also leaves behind a demonstrated commitment to biparti-sanship. He was widely known for his faithful attendance at the Senate Pray-er Breakfast every week. Colleagues who attend that breakfast regularly asked me about how he and Millie were doing. During his farewell speech, Senator Akaka said: 
In Congress and in our nation, we are truly all together, in the same canoe. If we paddle together in unison, we can travel great dis-tances. If the two sides of the canoe paddle in opposite directions, we will only go in cir-cles. 
Senator Akaka is deeply missed by all the people in Hawaii, and I dare say he will be deeply missed by his col-leagues in both the U.S. House and the Senate. The maile lei is here to signify his devotion and commitment to the people of Hawaii. I yield the floor to my colleague Sen-ator BRIAN SCHATZ . The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Hawaii. Mr. SCHATZ. Madam President, I thank Senator H
IRONO for her poignant remarks, and I want to offer my condo-lences to the family. Senator Daniel Kahikina Akaka died on Friday at the age of 93, leaving be-hind a legacy of integrity, kindness, and service to Hawaii and to the Na-tion. In Washington, Senator Akaka was an ambassador of ‘‘aloha.’’ He showed people kindness, respect, and hospi-tality rarely seen in this town. He didn’t just represent Hawaii’s interests in the Congress; he showed the world what Hawaii represents; in the words of President Kennedy, ‘‘all that we are and all that we hope to be.’’ He started that service as a welder in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. He fought in World War II in the Pacific arena, traveling to places like Tinian and Saipan. When World War II ended, he took advantage of the GI bill to at-tend the University of Hawaii to be-come a teacher—an occupation he never fully left behind. Senator Akaka served for 36 years in Congress—14 years in the House and 22 in the U.S. Senate. He was loved by colleagues in both parties because he was kind to everyone. In fact, he never said a bad word about anyone, not even in private. The foundation for his kind-ness came from his faith, which he learned from his mother Annie. He was a faithful attendee of the weekly Senate Prayer Breakfast, where he would lead Members singing hymns. He always began with the history of each song—a tradition he passed on to our own Chaplain, Chaplain Black, who continues it today. Danny Akaka was also very humble. There were times he didn’t get credit for the work he did here because he didn’t care about the credit. He cared about the work, about making a dif-ference for people, especially those whom he represented. He was deeply convinced that the government could improve people’s lives because he had seen that in his own life as a beneficiary of the GI bill. He would become the Senator who modernized that bill, bringing it into the 21st century. He always fought hard for veterans—for their benefits and their recognition, no matter the color of their skin or their country of origin. When someone once challenged him on the cost of benefits for vet-erans, he answered by saying: ‘‘The price has already been paid, many times over, by the service of the brave men and women who wore our nation’s uniform.’’ Senator Akaka never forgot the costs of war on our country, and he did ev-erything he could to make sure his col-leagues didn’t either. He voted against the Iraq war and advocated for peace and nuclear nonproliferation through-out his career. He was unrelenting when it came to the causes that were most important to him. As the only Native Hawaiian to ever serve in the U.S. Senate, he never stopped working to see Native Hawai-ians recognized in a government-to- government relationship with the United States. In his years on the Indian Affairs Committee, including as the chairman, he successfully sponsored the apology resolution, which recognized that the overthrow of the Queen—the only mon-arch in the United States—was illegal and facilitated by agents of our own Federal Government. This was the theme of Senator Akaka’s career—to advocate for people who did not have power and for people who were vulnerable. He was a cham-pion for the Federal Government em-ployees who, to this day, continue to be a punching bag for some. He spon-sored the 2012 Whistleblower Protec-tion Act, which ensures that Federal workers cannot be retaliated against if they report waste, fraud, and abuse. That was just one of the many things he did to make the Federal Govern-ment a better employer. Senator Akaka also fought for con-sumers. He helped people who were try-ing to get out of credit card debt. He made sure investors had an advocate at the Securities and Exchange Commis-sion, and he protected people who sent remittances around the world so they aren’t swindled out of their hard- earned money. Every morning he would begin his day by meeting visitors from Hawaii. Those connections to his constitu-ents—to home—drove his work and kept him focused on helping Hawaii. Much of his work was possible be-cause of the bipartisanship relation-ships he built with other Senators. Some of his best friends in the body— Senators I
NHOFE , COCHRAN , and B AR-
RASSO —were people with whom he did not agree very often. Every Member of this body—those who knew Senator Akaka and those who didn’t—can learn from his legacy—a legacy of quiet lead-ership, of treating others the way you want to be treated, and focusing on the things that matter to the people we are here to represent. I want to end with a few words from Chaplain Black. This is what he had to say about Senator Akaka: 
There’s something called ethical congru-ence—it refers to when your actions back up your rhetoric. And most of us struggle with that, because it’s very easy to say something but much more difficult to live it. There’s a verse in Scripture that says, we are living letters, so our lives should be something that people should be able to read. Francis of As-sisi said: preach the gospel everywhere you go; when necessary, use words. Senator Akaka preached the gospel everywhere he went, and very rarely had to use words. That’s the kind of ethical congruence that he had.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES1998 April 9, 2018 
The U.S. Senate and our country would be better off if there were more leaders like Danny. He fought for the vulnerable, promoted peace, and looked for common ground. Most of all, he em-bodied the ‘‘aloha’’ spirit and showed us all what it means to have a pure heart and be a true public servant. Our thoughts are with the family of Senator Akaka today, with Millie, his children, his grandchildren, his great- grandchildren, and his staff. He will be remembered and greatly missed. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. M

REMEMBERING ZELL MILLER  
Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, on the 23rd day of March, 2018, just a little over 2 weeks ago, Zell Bryan Miller of the State of Georgia—former Member of this body, former Governor of the State of Georgia, former State senator in the State of Georgia, former chair-man of the Democratic Party in the State of Georgia—who contributed im-mensely to his State, passed away at his beloved home in Young Harris, GA, in Towns County. I am here to pay tribute to Zell and his life and his contributions to our country, both for a purposeful reason, as far as a fellow Member, but also for a very personal reason for me, because he is an individual I met through poli-tics, became one of my best friends through politics, and probably had more influence personally on my life than anybody else I know in public service. As I said, Zell died in Young Harris, GA, the home of Young Harris College. Zell Miller was, first of all, a teacher and a writer. He wrote over 10 books. He taught. He was educated at the Uni-versity of Georgia. He taught at Young Harris College. He always taught throughout his career. Even as Gov-ernor and Lieutenant Governor, he was an instructor and a teacher. He was professorial, but he was tough as nails. There was only one way to do it and that was the Zell way, he used to say, and he knew how to get it done. He was for four terms the Lieutenant Governor of Georgia. He then ran for Governor in 1990. I happened to be his opponent in 1990, and I will get to that in just a minute. He won that election. It was pretty close. It has gotten a lot closer since then. Pretty soon, when I have grandchildren, I am going to tell them all I won. So far, that is not the case. But he won, and he was elected twice to be Governor of Georgia. As Governor of Georgia, he embraced education as a major issue. As I said, he was a teacher and was all about teaching. He did something that no-body had ever done and in numbers that were very impressive. He created what is known as the HOPE Scholar-ship, funded by the Georgia Lottery. A lot of lotteries have been passed and a lot of liquor referendums have been passed by promising people that the money was going to go to education, but it never really did. In Georgia, the way it was done is that it came out of the debates that he and I had in our race for Governor. We finally passed a constitutional amendment to allow legal gambling in Georgia and then passed the HOPE Scholarship, which was where the money went. We tied up all the money made from the lottery separately for three things: college scholarships for eligible Georgia stu-dents, 4-year-old voluntary prekinder-garten for Georgia pre-Ks to the age of 4, and technology and innovation and wiring and infrastructure in our public schools. The election was in 1990. He was elected in 1990 as the Governor of Geor-gia. He served two terms, but by the end of the decade, the lottery had passed. Since its passage, 1.8 million Georgia children have gotten their col-lege education—1.8 million—and 1.6 million Georgia 4-year-olds have gone to prekindergarten voluntarily. Geor-gia’s public schools are wired. They are on the internet. We deliver content through distance learning. It is at the leading edge of technology in public education of any State in the country. Now, politicians can take credit for a lot of things, but I don’t know of any-body who can take credit for 1.8 mil-lion college degrees, 1.4 million pre-kindergarten programs, wiring schools for the information technology of the 21st century, and doing it all based on a personal effort and commitment to see to it that the more we are edu-cated, the better the State will be. I said that Zell was an author. He was an author and a marine. He served in the Marine Corps from 1953 to 1956. He wrote a number of books about the Marine Corps. He wrote a number of ar-ticles about the Marine Corps. He wrote one book called ‘‘Corps Values.’’ The values he learned in the Marine Corps he used throughout his life in education, as Governor, as a father, and as a family man. Zell’s wife is Shirley Miller. Shirley is a wonderful lady, and I got to be with her a little bit 2 weeks ago during the services. Zell and Shirley are Geor-gia’s forever first family, not just be-cause they were Governor and first lady together and Lieutenant Governor and first lady together but also because Shirley was a partner with Zell. She wasn’t just his wife. Shirley worked tirelessly for Zell and for the State of Georgia, and to this day, she works tirelessly for our State. During Zell’s more difficult years—over the last few years having the difficulties he had healthwise—Shirley was there to be with Zell every single day. Zell Miller came to the Congress of the United States in a very unique way. Paul Coverdell, who had the seat that I hold today, died. Paul was a Re-publican. He was in his second term as a Republican. Roy Barnes was the Gov-ernor of Georgia, a Democrat, and when Paul Coverdell died, Roy Barnes called Zell up, who was then the imme-diate past Governor, and said: Zell, I need you to go to Washington and serve for me because the body is get-ting pretty close politically up there. We need to make sure a Democrat is in that place to replace Paul. I wasn’t involved in the conversation because I was hoping they were going to call me up, which I will get to in a minute. They didn’t, but they did later. But they hadn’t done it at that time. Roy said to Paul: You just have to do it for me, Governor Miller. You have to make sure that Georgia stays Demo-cratic. Zell went on public television and said: I want to accept this appointment to the U.S. Senate to fill this seat, but I am going to vote like Paul Coverdell. He knew how important Paul’s serv-ice had been in the State. He knew the conservative movement had taken the State and was moving in that direc-tion. Zell was a man of conscience and principle who recognized the impor-tance of the U.S. Senate seat, but, more importantly, he recognized the wishes of the voters. He told Roy Barnes, he told me, and he told every-body in the State: I am going to take it, but I will vote like Paul Coverdell. When that 4 years was up of finishing that term of Paul Coverdell, Zell Miller decided not to run again. I was in the U.S. House at that time, and he ran a press conference here in Washington to say: I will not seek reelection. That was in 2003. I got on the phone, called my wife, and said: I am going to go see Zell. If he is not going to run, I am going to run for that seat. That would be a good way to end my career and make a con-tribution to my State. I called Zell, and I said: Governor, can I come to see you this weekend in Young Harris. He said: Yes, come on. So I got in my pickup truck, which is a good way to drive in North Georgia, where a pickup truck is a standard op-erating vehicle. It was kind of a snow-flake morning in North Georgia and the North Georgia mountains in Young Harris. I sat down with Zell at the fire-place, with Woodrow and Gus, the two dogs, talking about politics. Finally, I got around to the subject of saying: Well, Zell, the reason I am here is that you announced that you are not going to run for reelection. I want to know if you have any issue with my running to replace you. He said: Put your shoes on, son. You can win that seat. Let me know what I can do to help you. I have never forgotten the encourage-ment, never forgotten what he said, and never forgotten the challenge I felt I had to thank the guy who had beaten me for Governor in 1990—to make a

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S1999 April 9, 2018 
statement like that when I was going to seek to replace him in the U.S. Sen-ate 24 years later. It made a lot of dif-ference to me in my life. Zell was a unique individual, and there has never been one like him. He was a Democrat the day he was born, and he was a Democrat the day he died. A lot of people remember he wrote a book, ‘‘A National Party No More,’’ which made a lot of Democrats mad. He spoke at the Democratic National Convention and made a lot of Repub-licans mad, and then he spoke at the Republican National Convention—the only elected person in history to de-liver the keynote address at both na-tional conventions, Republican and Democratic—not in the same year but in the same decade. Zell said what he thought, he thought what he said was right, and he delivered on everything he ever said, and if he ever was wrong, he apolo-gized. In his latter years, he appointed many of his former opponents to offices of importance in our State. For me, this is the first time I can publicly say thank you to Zell Miller. I know he is looking down, and I hope he is listening to what I am about to say. When he beat me in 1990 and when I ran to replace Sam Nunn when Sam stepped down in 1996 and lost that seat as well, I thought I was through with public service. I had made my best ef-fort and done as well as I could serving in the legislature but couldn’t make it to that higher place. After I had run for Sam Nunn’s seat, about 2 months after the race was over, Zell called me up, in August 1996, and said: Johnny, I have a problem. I have a Republican State school super-intendent and a Democratic legisla-ture, and they are fighting like hell, and I can’t solve the problem. But if I name you as school board chairman, then you can come over here and bal-ance this out, get the politics out of it, and help to solve the problem. Governor, I appreciate that, but I know what happens on a school board: You have 11 members on the board. I am chairman, and there are 10 other people who vote. You can’t change 10 people’s minds unless you know who those 10 people are. He said: You tell me who else to ap-point. I will fire the others and appoint the new people. Come over to the man-sion. So I went over to the mansion, and we sat there with his operator at the telephone desk and for 2 hours called people I knew I could trust and be-lieved in to help me with public edu-cation. I asked them to serve with me on the State board of education, take it over, clean up the mess which had taken place and which Zell acknowl-edged thoroughly. I accepted, he made the appointment, and over 2 years, we had a remarkable time period. In large measure because I thought my political career was over, I didn’t think about what I was doing as much politically as I thought prac-tically for kids. Zell wanted very much to see public education as the apex of his career, and so he wanted to make sure in that second term, it was. I ac-cepted. He worked hard. We joined to-gether, and we—to this day—had a great period of time for public edu-cation in our State in terms of im-provement, cashing in on the HOPE scholarship, and doing all the things that we did later on. I could go on and on, but I will just say this: I have worked with a lot of people, and I have known a lot of peo-ple. I have never known a better one than Zell Miller. I have never known anyone more true to their word, more solid to be counted on, who accepted their oath of office and every responsi-bility that went with it, who would say they were sorry when they needed to say they were sorry and would fight like hell when they needed to fight like hell and would never take no for an an-swer if they wanted you to do the right thing for the State of Georgia. For me on this night in Washington, DC, having gone to the funeral of my dear friend Zell Miller, having shared with his family and many others who loved him as I have over the years dur-ing those 2 days in Atlanta, let me close by saying that one of Georgia’s greatest citizens and probably our greatest Governor, Georgia’s first fam-ily in perpetuity, Zell and Shirley Mil-ler, will be missed greatly by our State and will be missed greatly by me. I thank God I had the opportunity to know Zell Bryan Miller and learn from him in the best way you can, and that is by working for him. God bless you, Zell. Thank you for what you did on behalf of the people of Georgia. God bless you and the United States of America. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.

OHN was remark-able—how different they were but how well they got along. In 1982, Arizona could not have elect-ed two more different Members to the U.S. House of Representatives. Mo Udall was elected to a 12th term. A third-generation Arizonan, Mo was a tall, lanky, Lincolnesque, one-eyed Mormon who tried to cheat his way into serving in World War II; self-effac-ing and humorous, a liberal Democrat in a conservative State who cham-pioned the environment and Native Americans and one of the most power-ful and respected Members of the House, who chaired the Interior Com-mittee critical to Arizona’s welfare. And J
OHN MCCAIN, an easterner and newcomer to Phoenix, having arrived only 2 years before running for Con-gress; a carpetbagger, some said; a stocky, handsome son and grandson of four-star Navy admirals who easily made his way into the U.S. Naval Academy, only to graduate 894 out of 899 in his class, due to his extreme re-belliousness. J
OHN is a man self-de-scribed as a ‘‘freshman right-wing Nazi’’ when he entered Congress but as a naval officer who could have been freed from imprisonment as a POW in Vietnam, yet refused to leave his men behind and instead suffered unimagi-nable torture and pain for over 5 years. Despite his novice as an Arizona poli-tician, J
OHN MCCAINknew enough to beg to secure a place on the Interior Committee. At that point, Mo’s de-cency and J
OHN’s courage met. While J
OHNwas new to Arizona politics and, by his own admission, could not tell a copper mine from a cotton field, he had promise, being elected president of his minority Republican class. Mo graciously, and with no political gain in sight that Mo could see, took JOHN under his generous, broad wing. Mo taught J
OHNthe power of consensus and bipartisanship, and, in turn, John had the guts to buck his own party. To-gether, they forged a remarkable part-nership. Mo is marked by graciousness, hu-mility, and humor; J
OHNby bombasity, independence, and courage. They were a perfect match. They sided together to protect the Grand Canyon. They sided together to protect Arizona wilderness. They sided together to improve the lives of our first Americans. They sided together to upend the campaign fi-nance system, to try to make sure poli-ticians are beholden to their constitu-ents, not to special interests. J
OHN took these positions in sharp contrast to his party. After Mo retired from the House and J
OHNhad entered the Senate, J
OHN continued to take fearless positions. He championed im-migration reform. He supports curbing methane emissions. Many Americans will never forget— and I was standing right about here when this happened—when, on July 28, 2017, J
OHN MCCAIN stepped into the well of the Senate and gave an unex-pected thumbs down to his party’s des-perate attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act. In 1982, Mo and J
OHNappeared to be worlds apart—Arizona politicians rep-resenting liberal Tucson and conserv-ative Phoenix, who would necessarily be at odds, yet they shared so much. Both stood by their principles, but both believed in working across the aisle to get things done for the Amer-ican people. Both put country over per-sonal ambition, fame, and fortune. Both were men of integrity, and both were courageous. All of us can learn from their duty to country over selves, their commitment to working for all Americans, and their dedication to working with the party across the aisle to reach consensus. Morris King Udall and J
OHN SIDNEY  M
CCAINIII were unlikely political al-lies and even more unlikely friends, but they were both, and both are true American heroes. Heroism is not born of words and bra-vado and bragging; heroism is born of silent deeds that help others. Mo and J
OHNaccomplished much by deed. Both are true Arizonans, true Americans, and true heroes. I am privileged to have known both men—to have grown up with Uncle Mo, to have campaigned with him, and to have shared his stories and stolen his jokes and to have served in the Senate and to serve with J
OHNMCCAIN. J
OHNand I have worked together on many issues. We have traveled inter-nationally. Our work together on the Senate Indian Affairs Committee has produced real results for Native Ameri-cans. After this Grand Canyon event I de-scribed in some of the remarks up there, I went to visit J
OHNat his ranch in Sedona. He is working hard to re-cover and wants to return to the Sen-ate. His spirits are good. He was re-turning calls and working on state-ments while we visited. He was plan-ning ranch projects right in front of us that had to do with the cottonwoods that were out in front of us as we were looking out at his place. His wonderful wife Cindy, a strong and talented woman in her own right, was at his side and working to make sure things were shipshape at the ranch. What a unique and loving partnership.

ACSC CONGRESS WEEK Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, I would call my colleagues’ attention to the recent 229th anniversary of the first quorum of the U.S. Congress. The House of Representatives achieved a quorum on April 1, 1789. Five days later, on April 6, the Senate marked that milestone. Each year, the Association of Centers for the Study of Congress, ACSC, com-memorates this anniversary by observ-ing Congress Week during the first week of April. Commemorative events around the country encourage students to explore the work of the U.S. Con-gress and its constitutional role in our government and promote advanced scholarly research. The ACSC was founded in 2003. It in-cludes more than 40 organizations and institutions that help to preserve and make available the archival records of Members of Congress. Each year, the annual meeting of the ACSC brings together Members of Con-gress who create the records, archivists who preserve the records, teachers who incorporate them into their lesson plans, and scholars who study them in order to advance our understanding of congressional history and the evo-lution of the political process. This year’s annual meeting will be hosted by the Robert J. Dole Institute of Poli-tics at the University of Kansas. Thanks to the work of the ACSC and its member organizations, we have sub-stantially improved the number and re-search value of congressional collec-tions being preserved nationwide, pro-ducing an educational resource for leg-islative branch studies that rivals the presidential library system. I am happy to report that the McCon-nell Center at the University of Louis-ville is one such member organization. Created in 1991, the McConnell Center nurtures ‘‘Kentucky’s next generation of great leaders’’ with programs fo-cused on service, leadership, and civic education. Last spring, at the annual meeting of the ACSC, I had the pleas-ure of participating in a fireside chat with the McConnell Center archivist, Deborah Skaggs Speth. We discussed the importance of Members preserving their records, which shed important light on what we do on behalf of the American people, and how we do it. In 2008, Congress unanimously passed H.Con.Res. 307. It recommended that Members’ records be properly main-tained, that each Member take all nec-essary measures to manage and pre-serve their records, that they arrange for the deposit or donation of their records with a research institution that is properly equipped to care for them, and that they make them avail-able for educational purposes at an ap-propriate time. Organizations like the McConnell Center and the Dole Institute, in col-laboration with the ACSC, are dili-gently working to ensure the preserva-tion of records for generations of stu-dents and scholars. I encourage my colleagues to pre-serve the records of their service in a research institution, where they can contribute to this vital, necessary, and growing component of our Nation’s documentary heritage.

REMEMBERING SERGEANT WILLIE SANDLIN Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to remember a man called Kentucky’s greatest hero, who served our Nation in the First World War and later received our highest military rec-ognition, the Medal of Honor. SGT Willie Sandlin, a native of Leslie Coun-ty, KY, single-handedly attacked and disabled three German machinegun nests during the Battle of the Argonne Forest in 1918. With only a rife, an automatic pistol, and four hand gre-nades, Sergeant Sandlin’s heroism re-sulted in the death of 24 German sol-diers and the capture of 200 more. At that time, Sergeant Sandlin was under the command of General John J. ‘‘Blackjack’’ Pershing, the commander of the American Expeditionary Force, who personally recommended him for the Medal of Honor and presented the award to him in February of 1919. In a recent edition of the Kentucky Humanities Magazine, Dr. James M. Gifford, the CEO and senior editor of the Jesse Stuart Foundation, published a profile on the life of Sergeant Sand-lin. Dr. Gifford traced his journey, from his birth in Appalachian poverty, through his remarkable service in the Great War, to his campaign to improve literacy rates in Kentucky. Named for the renowned author and Kentucky Poet Laureate, the Jesse Stuart Foun-dation publishes important works from Appalachian authors to help the re-gion’s unique heritage flourish. I would like to thank Dr. Gifford for his study of this proud son of Kentucky. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of Dr. Gifford’s article on Sergeant Sandlin’s life be printed in the R
ECORD . There being no objection, the mate-rial was ordered to be printed in the R
ECORD , as follows: [From the Kentucky Humanities Magazine, Fall 2017] S
ERGEANT SANDLIN : MEDAL OF HONOR  R
ECIPIENT  (By James M. Gifford) In 1917, after several years of provocation, America declared war on Germany. By No-vember of the following year, the United States had sent two million men overseas. In the bloody fighting that took place in the Meuse-Argonne Forest in the fall of 1918, thousands of Americans distinguished them-selves, including two young men from cen-tral Appalachia who received the Medal of Honor. On September 26, 1918, Sergeant Willie Sandlin, acting alone, attacked and disabled three German machine gun nests. During his heroic assaults, Sandlin killed 24 German soldiers and assisted in the capture of 200 more. Less than two weeks later, Cor-poral Alvin York led an attack on a German machine gun nest, taking 35 machine guns, killing at least 25 enemy soldiers, and cap-turing 132. Sandlin was from Hyden in Leslie County, Kentucky, and York was from Pall Mall, Tennessee, a community just across the Kentucky line. Although York and Sand-lin shared the same military distinctions and emerged from similar Appalachian commu-nities, their lives after World War I were re-markably different. York acquired money and fame and became a national icon and an international celebrity. Sandlin lived in modest circumstances, ill-health, and pur-poseful obscurity until he died of war-in-flicted gas poisoning at age 59. If war is a rich man’s war and a poor man’s fight, then Willie Sandlin represented mil-lions of poor men who became soldiers dur-ing World War I. Born into Appalachian pov-erty, on January 1, 1890 on Long’s Creek in Breathitt County, Kentucky, Sandlin’s par-ents were John ‘‘Dirty Face’’ Sandlin (born March 17, 1867) and Lucinda Abner Sandlin (born December 1870). John and Lucinda had five sons: Willie, Charlie, John, Elihue (Sonny), and Mathew (Mathy). When Willie was a boy, his father was imprisoned for murder, and Willie’s mother and father di-vorced in 1900. Lucinda, who was half Native American, died in childbirth in 1900, so Willie and his motherless siblings were di-vided among relatives, as was the custom of the day. Willie and his brothers Charles and John were raised by his father’s relatives in Leslie County. Sandlin enlisted in the Army on April 16, 1913, and served under John J. Pershing on the Mexican border. He re-enlisted in 1917 and was soon on his way to Europe as part of the American Expeditionary Force. Sandlin arrived on France’s bloody Western Front in time to take part in the Battle of the Ar-gonne Forest, the massive Allied offensive that finally defeated Kaiser Wilhelm’s war- weary German army. The Meuse-Argonne Of-fensive, also known as the Battle of the Ar-gonne Forest, was a major part of the final Allied offensive of World War I that stretched along the entire Western Front. It was fought from September 26, 1918, until the Armistice of November 11, 1918, a total of 47 days. The Meuse-Argonne Offensive was the largest in United States military history, in-volving 1.2 million American soldiers. Sandlin and his men were in several bat-tles during the summer of 1918. Then at Bois de Forges, France, on September 26, 1918, Sandlin emerged as one of the greatest he-roes of World War I. He was in charge of a platoon of 59 men when the day began. Fol-lowing an all-night artillery barrage, Sandlin’s platoon was ordered to advance that day toward a specific, important mili-tary objective. The line had been fighting for hours, advancing slowly, when the dough-boys were stopped by withering fire from

carefully placed machine gun nests, two guns to each nest. At 7 a.m., orders were given to ‘‘halt and lie down.’’ While others were try-ing to stay below the hail of deadly gunfire, Willie Sandlin had a rendezvous with destiny that changed his life forever. Sandlin ob-served a narrow lane between the firing line of the two guns. Arming himself with four hand grenades, an automatic pistol, and a rifle, he charged the nests alone. Advancing within 75 yards of the guns, he threw his first grenade, which fell short and exploded with-out effect. He raced forward while the enemy emptied two automatic revolvers at him. When he was less than 50 yards away from the intense machine gun fire, he threw his second grenade, which struck the nest. He then threw two more grenades, charged the nest, and killed three more German soldiers with his bayonet, making a total of eight enemy combatants that he killed there. Sandlin’s platoon advanced and he again took command of his men. The Americans moved forward and flanked another machine gun nest and Sandlin dispatched it in the same way, utilizing grenades. When his gre-nades were spent, four men still defended the nest. Sandlin had killed them all with his bayonet by the time his platoon arrived. The line continued to advance and at 2 p.m. Sandlin destroyed a third German machine gun nest and its occupants in similar fash-ion. His heroic assaults resulted in the death of 24 German soldiers and the capture of 200 more German soldiers. Sandlin’s com-mander, General John J. ‘‘Blackjack’’ Per-shing, praised him for ‘‘conspicuous gal-lantry and intrepidity above and beyond the call of duty’’ and recommended him for the Medal of Honor, detailing his heroic actions and praising the 28-year-old Sandlin’s ‘‘splendid example of bravery and coolness to his men.’’ Pershing personally presented the Medal of Honor to Sandlin in February of 1919 at Chaumont, the general headquarters of the AEF. Pershing would later describe Sandlin as the outstanding regular army sol-dier of World War I. When the war ended, Sandlin returned home to Leslie County for six months. In De-cember, 1919, because of his exemplary mili-tary record, he was appointed special escort for the bodies of soldiers who had died over-seas. Sandlin left for France in January 1920. Later that year, Sandlin returned home and married the former Belvia Roberts, a woman he began courting at a box dinner social after he first returned from Europe. Their happy marriage produced one son and four daughters who reached adulthood: Vorres, born in 1921, followed by Leona, Nancy Ruth, Florence, and Robert E. Lee Sandlin. Cora and Rose died of childhood diseases before their fourth birthdays. Like his more famous counterpart, Ten-nessee’s Alvin York, Sandlin returned home with a heightened commitment to education and community service. In the years fol-lowing WWI, eastern Kentuckians were working to improve the quality of life in their mountain homeland. Two of the re-gion’s greatest leaders were Mary Breckin-ridge, founder of the Frontier Nursing Serv-ice at Hyden in 1925, and Cora Wilson Stew-art, founder of the ‘‘Moonlight School’’ pro-gram to promote literacy. Newspapers re-ported that Willie Sandlin, ‘‘Kentucky’s greatest hero’’ had joined the crusade ‘‘to help stamp out illiteracy in Kentucky.’’ Sandlin toured the state with Stewart and spoke in hundreds of towns and villages. He was so devoted to Mrs. Stewart and her cam-paign that he and Belvia named their second child after her—Cora Wilson Stewart Sand-lin. Willie Sandlin never presented himself as a celebrity. He was too modest to seek public adoration and too shy to enjoy the attention of the media, but he did, on several occa-sions, attend local and national meetings where he was recognized as a Medal of Honor recipient. Throughout the 1920s, Sandlin con-tinued to attend Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) meetings in the hope that the VFW could help him receive additional benefits as a wounded, injured, and disabled veteran. Like many wounded veterans, Sandlin wasted no time in pursuing benefits. In 1921, government physicians at a Veterans Center in Richmond, Kentucky, examined Sandlin and reported that he was ‘‘suffering a serious lung infection as a result of gas inhaled’’ in the Battle of the Argonne Forest. To make a claim for increased compensation, in 1925 Sandlin appeared before the United States Veterans’ Bureau in Lexington. Sandlin was only receiving $10 a month compensation for being a Medal of Honor recipient, a reduction from the $40 a month he was receiving when he was ‘‘invalided home.’’ In 1928, at age 38, Sandlin should have been in his physical prime when he moved back to a house on his father-in-law’s property. Instead, according to some newspaper accounts, he was very ill. Sandlin ‘‘coughed and wheezed a great deal,’’ especially in the winter. By 1928, Sandlin had spent time in hospitals in Chillicothe and Cincinnati, Ohio, and ‘‘other places.’’ An old army buddy encouraged Willie to move to Colorado because he thought ‘‘the dry air and high altitude’’ would help him. But Willie would not leave his eastern Kentucky homeland, and he didn’t have enough money to travel if he had wanted to. ‘‘I’m not one- third the man I used to be before the war,’’ he observed without complaint. ‘‘If I take 25 steps up the hill, I’m done for. My wind’s gone.’’ In 1928, Indiana Senator Arthur R. Robinson and others presented a bill to Con-gress which ‘‘would enlist and retire as a captain Willie Sandlin, Kentucky hero of the world war, who is now destitute.’’ The whole unproductive process of seeking the benefits he deserved became exhausting and demor-alizing to Willie Sandlin, yet he had no choice but to continue. Aware of Sandlin’s financial difficulties, Senator Hiram Brock, who represented Les-lie County in the state legislature, continued his efforts to get funds from the state gov-ernment to purchase a farm for Sandlin. Sen-ator Brock’s efforts had been inspired by the American Legion’s efforts to raise money to provide a home for Sandlin and his family so they could ‘‘live with the common comfort of life.’’ During the 1920s, the VFW had estab-lished a ‘‘Hero Fund’’ and called upon ‘‘all patriotic citizens, along with members of the Veterans of Foreign Wars’’ and ‘‘others throughout the country to mail in their con-tributions to the VFW, McClelland Building, Lexington, Kentucky.’’ VFW leaders said there would have been no need to raise funds to buy a home for the Sandlins if Willie had been willing to ‘‘sell his birthright for a mess of pottage.’’ According to VFW leaders, a ‘‘celebrated moving picture concern’’ had of-fered Willie $500 a week to re-enact his he-roic deeds, but ‘‘Sandlin refused to capitalize on his war records’’ and turned down ‘‘other offers to profit from his patriotism.’’ Life after the war was just one medical ex-amination after another for Willie. He was examined at Cincinnati in 1928 and given a 69 percent disability rating, which would have entitled him to a fair compensation. But the Louisville Veterans’ Bureau, which had ju-risdiction over Sandlin, appealed that rating to the Bureau of Appeals at Chicago and the bureau then placed the case before the Vet-erans’ Bureau in Washington. Bureaucracies do not always yield justice, and technical-ities blocked compensation for him, making a special action by Congress necessary. De-spite his continuing efforts, Sandlin, who had been wounded twice and gassed twice, never received any disability compensation from the Veterans Bureau, and he never re-ceived a penny of the money that was do-nated by private citizens to purchase a farm for him and his family. By the beginning of the Great Depression, Willie Sandlin realized that he would prob-ably not receive any money from the Vet-erans Administration Bureau to compensate him for his warsustained injuries. So the Sandlins did what tens of thousands of Appa-lachian families did: ‘‘they hunkered down’’ and ‘‘did the best they could with what they had.’’ They became subsistence farmers. Drawing on practices that were more than a century old, subsistence farmers, like the Sandlins, produced almost everything they needed from their farms and nearby fields and forests. They raised cows, hogs, and chickens for meat, which was supplemented by food from vegetable gardens and orchards. During the Depression, Willie and Belvia both worked extremely hard to make a good life and a good home for their children. Dur-ing those years, Willie also worked as a su-pervisor on a WPA road project. Although Sandlin’s health continued to worsen, he still had a large family to sup-port. So, in 1941, for the first time in his life, Willie sought political office and ran unsuc-cessfully as an Independent for Leslie Coun-ty jailer. In December 1941, a journalist called on the Sandlins at their home. Willie, Belvia, and their guest sat comfortably in ‘‘a long living room’’ and talked about ‘‘a number of things,’’ but soon the conversation turned to Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor and Amer-ica’s entrance into another world war. Willie refused to talk about his heroics in World War I, but he told his visitor that if his health were better and if ‘‘the navy would take [me, I would] join tomorrow.’’ In the early spring of 1942, the old warrior, who was 52 years old and in very bad health, went to Hyden and registered for the draft. Early in May 1949, Willie’s breathing prob-lems grew much worse. Belvia took him to the hospital in Hyden; two days later he was transported by ambulance to the Veteran’s Hospital in Louisville. Belvia went with him and stayed in the hospital room for the next three weeks, along with her daughters, Flor-ence and Vorres. One of them was always in Willie’s room. In the early morning hours of May 29, Belvia and Vorres had gone to the lobby to rest while Florence remained in the room with her father, sitting next to Willie’s bed and holding his hand. Doctors had advised Willie to move to Phoenix. They thought the climate and environment there might im-prove his health. He squeezed his daughter’s hand and said, ‘‘We missed the train [to Phoenix].’’ And then he was dead. He went easy, with a smile and a sigh. He was origi-nally buried in the Hurricane Cemetery in Hyden; however, in September 1990, Sandlin’s widow had his remains re-interred in the Zachary Taylor National Cemetery in Louis-ville. When Belvia died in 1999, at age 98, she was buried next to her husband. Now he belongs to the ages. He had been raised in poverty and had grown into a quiet, resolute man of courage and honor. Willie Sandlin spent a lifetime accepting adversity and inequity and meeting life’s challenges with a smile and a ‘‘can do’’ attitude. All he wanted from life was to serve his country, build a home, and enjoy his loving family, and he achieved his goals through hard work. Only death can stop men like Willie Sandlin. f

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2003 April 9, 2018 
of Pineville, KY, in remembering the life of Mayor Robert Madon. Bob, who led his community for nearly two dec-ades, passed away earlier this year at the age of 83. Throughout his life of ac-complishment for his hometown, Bob earned the affection of his neighbors and the gratitude of the people he served so well. Graduating from Pineville High School, Bob attended the Millersburg Military Institute before joining the U.S. Air Force to serve in Korea. Bob returned to Bell County after his mili-tary service and, like so many of his fellow veterans, was active in his local American Legion post and other civic organizations. One of the oldest traditions in south-eastern Kentucky is the Mountain Lau-rel Festival. Named after the mountain laurel flower that commonly grows in Appalachia, the annual festival cele-brates the region’s heritage through concerts, carnivals, craft and talent shows, a parade, and a beauty pageant. This May, Pine Mountain State Park will host the 88th annual festival. For many years, Bob was an integral part of the festival’s success, as the general chairman in 1966 and serving on the ad-visory board from 1967 to 1972. The pin-nacle of the festival’s traditions is the selection of the Mountain Laurel Prin-cess and the Mountain Laurel Queen. Young women from local high schools compete for the title of princess, and universities from throughout the Com-monwealth send candidates seeking the queen’s crown. Serving as its emcee, Bob was the voice of the festival and the contest for many years. One of Bob’s friends remembers his passion for the Mountain Laurel Fes-tival. ‘‘He was everywhere making sure people were picking up debris from their yard, mowing the grass, painting the curbs, cleaning up the city.’’ When Pineville was on display for visitors, Bob worked hard to help it shine. In 1995, the festival honored Bob by in-cluding him in its hall of fame. He would later also receive the festival’s ‘‘Outstanding Service Award’’ and the ‘‘Lifetime Honorary Directors Award’’ as well-deserved recognition of Bob’s unrelenting work to make the festival a success every year. In 1968, at the request of the new gov-ernor, Louie Nunn, Bob decided to leave Bell County and begin a political career in Frankfort. As an administra-tive assistant to Governor Nunn in the first Republican administration in two decades, Bob served the people of the Commonwealth in State government. After his time in Frankfort, Bob re-turned to his hometown to fill a va-cancy on the Pineville City Council in 1971. Later, Bob was named a city judge and served in that capacity until his election as the mayor of Pineville in 1977. Beginning his first term as mayor only months after the devastating flood, Bob certainly had an over-whelming task ahead of him. That April, the Cumberland River topped the floodwall and devastated the community. During the crisis, Bob was integral to ensuring the safety of these Kentuckians. According to one of his friends, ‘‘Bobby made sure that ev-erybody got up on the hill.’’ Bob led the effort to rebuild, serving on the flood related projects committee, and as mayor helped bring millions of dol-lars to extend the floodwall to prevent future tragedies. Working with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Bob oversaw the project. It was completed in 1988, the year after he left office. After a period out of public office, Bob was elected as mayor again in 1994 and served until the end of 2002. He was again reelected for his final term in 2007 before leaving in 2008. During his time in office, Bob oversaw the con-struction of a new U.S. 25E bypass, which was later named in his honor. While leading Pineville as its mayor, Bob also participated in the Kentucky League of Cities, KLC. This organiza-tion is dedicated to helping cities and their leaders accomplish their goals through trainings, advocacy, and pol-icy research. For nearly three decades, Bob was a director of the KLC and served one term as its president. Bob’s passion for his community ex-tended far beyond public service. He spent years of his life in many other pursuits speaking directly with the families of Pineville. During a profes-sional career that included managing a number of radio stations and the Pine-ville-Sun Cumberland Courier, Bob was also the voice of the Pineville Moun-tain Lions. An avid sports lover, he later became a Kentucky High School Sports Association official in both boys and girls basketball games. Bob was also a faithful member of the First Baptist Church in Pineville, singing in the choir and working as the associate Sunday school superintendent. Those who knew Bob—and that seemed to be just about everyone in Pineville—recalled that he was always talking about his hometown. For any-one who shared their concerns with him, Bob would do his best to fix them. His life was one of passion for his neighbors, and the whole Pineville community benefited from his work. His son Scott even followed in Bob’s footsteps and serves as the current mayor of Pineville. Bob’s memorial service drew hun-dreds of people to pay their respect to the man who made such a significant impact on their lives. The people’s out-pouring of support was a fitting tribute to the man who lived his life for his neighbors.

TRIBUTE TO TED HAMPTON Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to con-gratulate Ted Hampton, of Knox Coun-ty, KY, who was named the 2017 Man of the Year by the Knox County Chamber of Commerce during an event at Union College’s student center. For more than 50 years, Ted has served as the CEO of Cumberland Valley Rural Elec-tric Cooperative. At his hiring, Ted was one of the youngest distribution man-agers in the country. Now, he has the distinction of being the second longest serving in the country. Throughout his tenure leading the organization, Ted has overseen the building of a new headquarters, a branch office, and the hiring of hun-dreds of employees. One of his col-leagues spoke highly of Ted’s service, saying his greatest accomplishment has been keeping his employees as safe as possible. At the awards ceremony, Ted was joined by his wife, Margie, and their 8- year-old granddaughter Tori. During his remarks to accept the award, Ted warmly acknowledged all of his co-workers for their work to serve the area. I would like to join the Knox Country community on congratulating Ted on this award, and I urge my col-leagues to join me. f 
BUDGETARY REVISIONS Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, on March 22, 2018, I filed adjustments to enforce-able budgetary levels to accommodate spending in H.R. 1625, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, P.L. 115–141. Included in the spending that qualified for cap adjustments was program in-tegrity funding that is classified as off- budget. The previous adjustment cor-rectly increased the allocation to the Appropriations Committee to accom-modate this spending but also in-creased the spending aggregate for fis-cal year 2018. Under the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the spending aggre-gate should only reflect on-budget amounts. As such, I am reducing the spending aggregate by $295 million in budget authority and $257 million in outlays. I ask unanimous consent that the ac-companying table be printed in the R
ECORD . There being no objection, the mate-rial was ordered to be printed in the R

The esti-mated cost is $1.31 billion. This proposed sale will contribute to the foreign policy and national security of the United States by helping to improve-the se-curity of an important partner which has been and continues to be a leading contrib-utor of political stability and economic progress in the Middle East. This sale will increase the Royal Saudi Land Force’s (RSLF) interoperability with U.S. forces and conveys U.S. commitment to Saudi Arabia’s security and armed forces modernization. The proposed sale will improve Saudi Ara-bia’s capability to meet current and future threats and provide greater security for its border regions and critical infrastructure. The RSLF currently has M109A2, A3 and A5 howitzers in its inventory. These additional modernized howitzers will enhance Saudi Arabia’s ability to support its deployed forces and defend its borders. Saudi Arabia will have no difficulty absorbing these vehi-cles into its armed forces. The prime contractor for this requirement is unknown at this time. There are no known offset agreements in connection with this po-tential sale. Implementation of this proposed sale will not require the assignment of any additional U.S. or contractor representatives to Saudi Arabia. Support teams will travel to the country on a temporary basis. There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-fense readiness as a result of this proposed sale. 
TRANSMITTAL NO . 16–48 Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act Annex Item No. vii (vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 1. This sale will involve the release of sen-sitive technology to Saudi Arabia. The RSLF seeks to purchase the 155mm M109A6 Paladin Medium Self-Propelled Howitzer system. The Paladin M109A6 howitzer is the fourth prod-uct improvement to the original M109 self- propelled howitzer. It features improvements in the areas of survivability, reliability, availability, maintainability, responsive-ness, and terminal effects. The M109A6 is an armored, full tracked howitzer carrying 37 complete conventional rounds and two Cop-perhead projectiles and operated by a crew of four. It is designed with a new turret struc-ture that facilitates integration of the var-ious turret improvements and vulnerability reduction measures. It improves overall crew compartment layout and space. The howitzer can travel at a maximum speed of 38 miles per hour and has a maximum cruising range of 186 miles. The M109A6 can operate inde-pendently, from on the move, it can receive a fire mission, compute firing data, select and take up its firing position, automati-cally unlock and point its cannon, fire and move—all without external technical assist-ance. Firing the first round following a move in under 60 seconds, a ‘‘shoot and scoot’’ ca-pability protects the crew from counterbat-tery fire. The M109A6 is capable of firing up to four rounds per minute to ranges of 30 kil-ometers. The M109A6 features increased sur-vivability characteristics such as day/night operability and Nuclear, Biological, Chem-ical (NBC) protection with climate control and secure voice and digital communica-tions. The crew remains in the vehicle throughout the mission. 2. The Electronic Fire Control System (EFCS). Commonly referred to as the Pal-adin Fire Control System (PFCS), it is the major change for the Paladin M109A6 How-itzer from the manual fire control system used on the M109A5. The integrated elec-tronic digital Fire Control System includes an Embedded Trainer. It gives the howitzer the ability to operate over a widely dispersed area and to move and emplace using the on-board fire control system (Dynamic Ref-erence Unit Hybrid Replacement Inertial Navigation System) and a plug-in AN/PCN– 13A Defense Advanced Global Positioning System Receiver with a Selective Avail-ability Anti-spoofing Module (SAASM). The M109A6 can move and position within an as-signed position area, process technical firing data, and fire a mission without relying on aiming circles and wire lines. The M109A6 can change position more frequently, an ad-vantage against enemy fire. 3. The Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS) provides the multi-service automated Fire Support Command, Control and Communications portion of the Army Battle Command System (ABCS). AFATDS enables the maneuver commander to plan and execute attacks on the right tar-get, at the right time, with the right weap-ons system, and the right munitions. It pro-vides for maximum utilization of the fire support assets available on an expanding battlefield. It supports the close, deep, and rear battle fire support requirements of land and littoral doctrine. AFATDS is designed for full interoperability with the other ABCS Battlefield Functional Areas as well as with the Fire Support capabilities of the Navy’s Joint Maritime Command Information Sys-tem (JMCIS) and the Air Force’s Theater Battle Management Core System (TBMCS). 4. The Driver’s Vision Enhancer Wide (DVE Wide) improves survivability and mission ca-pability by providing drivers with wider fields of view as well as the elimination of blind spots to safely navigate through dust, sand, haze, smoke, light fog and the blackest night. The front facing DVE Wide integrates three state-of-the-art 640 × 480, 17 μm uncooled infrared sensors, which output a stitched video of a 107 × 30 field of view (POV). The DVE Wide can receive, manage

and display video from multiple external cameras on the vehicle. The driver can elec-tronically pan through the 107 ° total hori- zontal field of view allowing the driver the ability to see both sides of the road. The ve-hicle wheel track indicators aid the driver in clearly identifying any potential impedi-ments to safe operation. The DVE Wide is fully backwards compatible with all fielded DVE units, which means that any vehicle currently equipped with a DVE system can be readily upgraded. It is also forward com-patible with new, high resolution, touch- screen displays. The DVE Wide is an UN-CLASSIFIED system. 5. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements of the M109A6, the information could be used to de-velop countermeasures or equivalent sys-tems which might reduce weapon system ef-fectiveness or be used in the development of a system with similar or advanced capabili-ties. 6. A determination has been made that Saudi Arabia can provide the same degree of protection for the sensitive technology being released as the U.S. Government. This sale is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and national security objectives out-lined in the Policy Justification. 7. All defense articles and services listed in this transmittal have been authorized for re-lease and export to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

TRANSMITTAL NO . 17–71 Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act Annex Item No. vii (vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 1. The MQ–4C Triton hardware and soft-ware procured for this potential sale are UN-CLASSIFIED. The MQ–4C is optimized for long range and prolonged flight endurance. The MQ–4C Triton will be a forward de-ployed, land-based, autonomously operated system that provides a persistent maritime Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnais-sance (ISR) capability to include data collec-tion, analysis, and situational reporting. Aircraft system, sensor, and navigational status are provided continuously to the ground operators through a health and sta-tus downlink for mission monitoring. Navi-gation is via inertial navigation with inte-grated global positioning system (GPS) up-dates. The vehicle is capable of operating from a standard paved runway. Real time missions are flown under the control of a pilot in a Mission Control Station (MCS). It is designed to carry a non-weapons max-imum internal payload of 3,200 lbs, maximum external payload of 2,400 lbs, consisting pri-marily of sensors and avionics. The MQ–4C will include the Mission Control Station (MCS) which consists of the following com-ponents: a. The Mission Control Station (MCS) is the MQ–4C Triton UAS ground control sta-tion required to operate the MQ–4C Triton UAS. The MOB MCS (MD–3A) provides MQ– 4C Triton Aircraft Command & Control (C2). The MOB MCS consists of a primary and backup system, an embedded training capa-bility, requisite data links, communication systems, antennas, computer work-stations and hardware/software for air vehicle, and tactical coordinator. The MOB MCS commu-nications consists of both Line of Sight (LOS) and Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) ca-pabilities to control the Triton Unmanned Aircraft worldwide. The MOB technical data and documentation are UNCLASSIFIED. b. The MQ–4C Triton UAS Forward Oper-ating Base (FOB) (MD–3B) is used for aircraft launch and recovery and is physically lo-cated at the same location as the MQ–4C Tri-ton aircraft. The FOB MCS is similar to the MOB MCS, but the FOB MCS does not proc-ess or control any payload information. The FOB MCS is manned by air vehicle operators only and used for line of sight Aircraft C2 while beyond line of sight control is used as a back-up communication line. The FOB MCS consists of requisite data links, com-munication systems, antennas, computer work-stations and hardware/software for air vehicle operator control. The FOB technical data and documentation are UNCLASSI-FIED. c. The MQ–4C employs a quad-redundant Inertial Navigation System/Global Posi-tioning System (INS/GPS) configuration. The system utilizes two different INS/GPS systems for greater redundancy. The system consists of two LN–251 units and two Kearfott KN–4074E INS/GPS Units. The LN– 251 is a fully integrated, non-dithered navi-gation system with an embedded Selective Availability/Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM), P(Y) code or Standard Positioning Service (SPS) GPS. It utilizes a Fiber-Optic Gyro (FOG) and includes three independent navi-gation solutions: blended INS/GPS, INS-only, and GPS-only. The Kearfott KN–4074E fea-tures a Monolithic Ring Laser Gyro (MRLG) and accelerometer. The inertial sensors are tightly coupled with an embedded SAASM P(Y) code GPS. Both systems employ crypto graphic technology that can be classified up to SECRET. 2. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain knowledge of specific hard-ware, the information could be used to de-velop countermeasures which might reduce weapons system effectiveness or be used in the development of a system with similar or advanced capabilities. 3. A determination has been made that Germany can provide substantially the same degree of protection for sensitive technology being released as the U.S. Government. This proposed sustainment program is necessary to the furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and national security objectives outlined in the policy justification. 4. All defense articles and services listed on this transmittal are authorized for release and export to the Government of Germany. DEFENSE SECURITY  C

The proposed sale of 155mm howitzer am-munition will improve Australia’s capability to meet out-year Operational Readiness Training requirements. Australia will use this capability to strengthen its homeland defense and deter regional threats. Australia will have no difficulty absorbing this equip-ment into its armed. The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not alter the basic military bal-ance in the region. The principal contractor will be deter-mined at a later date. Material could poten-tially be sourced from a combination of stock and procurement. There are no known offset agreements proposed in connection with this potential sale. Implementation of this proposed sale will not require the assignment of any additional U.S. Government or contractor representa-tives to Australia. There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-fense readiness as a result of this proposed sale. 
TRANSMITTAL NO . 17–72 Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act Annex Item No. vii (vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 1. The M795 Insensitive Munitions Explo-sive (IMX) 101 Explosive Fill 155mm HE Pro-jectile is UNCLASSIFIED. The M231/M232A1 Modular Artillery Charge System (MACS) consists of two propelling charges, the M231 and the M232/232A1, and associated pack-aging. The system is compatible with all cur-rent and planned 155mm field artillery weap-ons. MACS uses a ‘‘build-a-charge’’ concept in which increments are identical to all oth-ers in the same lot desiccation, retained for future use. The M231 is fired either singly (Charge 1–L) or in pairs (Charge–2L) to en-gage targets. The M232/M232A1 is fired in groups of 3 (Charge–3H) or groups of 4 (Charge–4H) or groups of 5 (Charge–5H) to en-gage targets. The highest classification level of the charge is UNCLASSIFED. 2. Although the charges are UNCLASSI-FIED, they have associated technology that is sensitive. Certain aspects of the perform-ance, specifically the interior ballistics char-acteristics, and some of the design features are considered sensitive data. This UNCLAS-SIFIED sensitive data could be used by a technologically advanced potential enemy to duplicate the charges through reverse engi-neering. No technical data packages or test information should be supplied. 3. A determination has been made that Australia can provide substantially the same degree of protection for the sensitive tech-nology being released as the U.S. Govern-ment. This sale is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and national secu-rity objectives outlined in the Policy Jus-tification. 4. All defense articles and services listed in this transmittal have been authorized for re-lease and export to Australia.

The estimated total cost is $2.91 billion. This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and national security of the United States by helping to improve the security of a NATO partner that is an important force for ensuring peace and stability in Europe. The proposed sale will support Slovakia’s needs for its own self-defense and support NATO defense goals. Slovakia intends to use these F–16s to modernize its Air Force and strengthen its homeland defense. Slovakia intends for these aircraft to re-place its current fleet of MiG–29s. Slovakia’s current fighters are not interoperable with U.S. forces or regional allies. Purchase of the F–16V will provide Slovakia with fourth gen-eration fighter aircraft capability that is interoperable with the United States and NATO. The proposed sale of new F–16V’s to Slo-vakia will not impact the regional balance of power. The prime contractor will be Lockheed Martin, headquartered in Bethesda, Mary-land. There are no known offset agreements in conjunction with this sale, however, we expect Slovakia to request some amount of industrial participation. Any offset agree-ment will be defined in negotiations between the purchaser and the contractor. Implementation of this proposed sale may require assignment of a small number of U.S. Government representatives (less than 10) and a modest number of contractor rep-resentatives (less than 50) to Slovakia. It is likely that no permanent U.S. persons will actually be required in country. There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-fense readiness as a result of this proposed sale.

STRENGTHENING PROTECTIONS FOR SOCIAL SECURITY BENE-FICIARIES ACT OF 2018 Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of H.R. 4547, the Strengthening Protections for Social Security Beneficiaries Act of 2018, a bi-partisan bill developed by House Ways and Means Social Security Sub-committee Chairman S
AMJOHNSON and Ranking Member J
OHN LARSON . This bill updates the representative payee program by strengthening oversight and beneficiary protections, while im-proving payee selection and quality. As a true testament to Chairman J
OHNSON  and Ranking Member L
ARSON ’s bipar-tisan work, the bill passed both the House of Representatives and the Sen-ate unanimously just before Congress adjourned in March. Social Security’s Representative Payment program provides financial management for the Social Security and Supplemental Security Income, SSI, payments of beneficiaries who are incapable of managing their Social Se-curity or SSI payment. Today almost 6 million representative payees manage benefits on behalf of about 8 million Social Security beneficiaries and SSI recipients. Most often, the representa-tive payee is a family member, like a spouse or a parent. When friends or family are not available to serve as payees, Social Security can use quali-fied organizations to be representative payees. Most payees perform their duties re-sponsibly and with care. Some do not, and stakeholders in this process have raised concerns. The Social Security Advisory Board, the National Academy of Sciences, the Government Account-ability Office, and Social Security’s in-spector general have uncovered prob-lems with current policy and ideas for improvement. It has been almost 15 years since the last significant change to the law in this area, and this bill makes several needed policy changes and common sense improvements. The bill strengthens oversight of rep-resentative payees by requiring addi-tional types of reviews of payee per-formance and draws on the expertise of the protection and advocacy system of each state to conduct the reviews. The bill reduces the burden on families by eliminating the requirement to file the annual accounting form for representa-tive payees who are parents or spouses and are living with the beneficiary. The bill requires data exchanges be-tween SSA and State foster care agen-cies to identify when there is a change in status of a beneficiary in foster care and reassess whether the payee is ap-propriate. The bill allows new bene-ficiaries to make an advance payee des-ignation. Finally, the bill codifies cur-rent policy that bars felons from serv-ing as a payee and requires SSA to re-check all existing payees. In 2016, my office was contacted by Lexie Gruber, a former foster youth from Connecticut. Lexie’s story brought a human face to this issue and showed where the system had gone wrong. This young woman had recently aged out of foster care, graduated col-lege at the top of her class, and moved to Washington, DC, for a new job, a success story that is unfortunately all too rare for children who have grown up in foster care. Lexie was working hard, but still struggled to afford living expenses in an expensive city while trying to work hard to save for law school. That was before the IRS noti-fied her that the value of outstanding SSI overpayments were going to be withheld from her tax returns. This was outstanding debt she didn’t know she had for benefits she never even got. To me, this is the definition of unjust. She had to contact Congress for help and since then has worked tirelessly to help ensure that other former foster youth aren’t forced through her experi-ence. This bill fixes this flaw in the system to ensure that youth aging out of care, struggling to make it on their own, aren’t held liable for the mistakes of or misinformation from foster care agencies. I thank Chairman J
OHNSON , Ranking Member L
ARSON , and their staff for putting together this bipartisan bill. It is another example of what can be ac-complished when working together.

HONORING DEPUTY JACOB PICKETT Mr. DONNELLY. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize and honor the extraordinary service and sacrifice of Boone County Deputy Jacob Pickett of Zionsville, IN. His life was character-ized by selflessness, dedication to his community, and a deep love for his family and faith. Jake graduated from Brownsburg High School in 2002. He graduated from the Marion County Sheriff’s Office Training Academy in 2010 and the Indi-ana Law Enforcement Academy in 2014. He was employed as a detention deputy with the Marion County Sheriff’s Office for 3 years. After serving the Marion County Sheriff’s Office, he served as a deputy at the Tipton County Sheriff’s Department from 2013 to 2015. In 2015, he began his work in Boone County as a taser instructor, K–9 team leader, and a member of the Fraternal Order of Police No. 110. From the start, his col-leagues say they knew he would be a great officer and that he was the one who would be there to help if anyone ever needed him. Jake grew up with a kind heart, al-ways standing up for those in need. He was described by Rev. Steve Reeves, his little league coach and pastor who bap-tized him as a teenager, as someone who ‘‘had a kindness about him. He wanted to do well.’’ His selflessness carried over into adulthood; whether it was serving in uniform, organizing a Christmas card drive, or volunteering to rescue animals, he continuously gave back to his community. Ulti-mately, Jake put his life on the line to protect the community he loves, and for his service, we are forever grateful. The morning that he was killed, he was greeting students at Perry-Worth Elementary with his sidekick K–9, a German Shepherd named Brik. Those who knew Jake best said his love for Brik was unwavering, and he extended that love to his family and those in the community he worked to protect. On Friday, March 2, 2018, Jake was fatally shot following a pursuit in Leb-anon, IN. He was kept on life support for a few days, so that his life of serv-ice could continue through organ dona-tion. After he was taken off life sup-port, his heart was donated to a pa-tient in need at St. Vincent Hospital in Indianapolis. A devoted and loving father and hus-band, he is survived by his wife, Jen-nifer Pickett, a teacher at White Lick Elementary School; his two sons; par-ents Marlin and Rebecca Pickett; sister Kristi M. Woo; niece Hannah N. Woo; parents-in-law Jon and Carol Lindstrom; brothers-in-law Jeremy Lindstrom and Christopher Lindstrom; his faithful K–9 partner Brik; and many other relatives and friends. Jake went above and beyond for his children, and it was well known that the happiest day of his life was when he became a father. He was often seen giving his sons rides around the yard on the lawn-mower for fun, and he will be remem-bered by his loving spirit. Jake set an example for others and will be remembered for his love for his family, his faith in God, and his brav-ery. Let us remember and emulate the example this man set for us and honor his commitment to serving his fellow citizens. (At the request of Mr. S
CHUMER , the following statement was ordered to be printed in the R

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
REMEMBERING HOWARD T. OWENS, JR. ∑Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart to pay tribute to Howard T. Owens, Jr., an ex-emplary public servant, leader, and friend. Sadly, Mr. Owens passed away on April 3, 2018, at the age of 83. He will be remembered for his outstanding leg-acy of dedication to Connecticut as both a statesman and a judge. Howard began his impressive career in public service as an assistant U.S. attorney and then as a State senator representing the city of Bridgeport and the town of Trumbull. I had the honor of briefly serving with Howard during my tenure in the Connecticut House of Representatives. Beginning in 1974 through 1988, How-ard held this seat with the exception of one term in 1984. He took every oppor-tunity while in the capitol to improve the quality of life for not just those who elected him, but for all the people of Connecticut, whether it was pro-moting mass transit, especially for the urban centers, as senate cochair of the transportation committee or seeking a fairer justice system as senate cochair of the judiciary committee. In 1998, Howard’s passion for State service took on a new shape when he received the appointment to serve as a judge on the superior court. Through-out his time as a State judge, he pre-sided over a number of high-profile cases, which earned Howard recogni-tion for his patient, thoughtful over-sight of complex divorce decisions. Although dedicated to public service, Howard always made time for his friends, especially when they needed help—in the courtroom, as well as out-side of it. His legacy of unfailing serv-ice and dedication to his community is evident when speaking with anyone who knew him. A caring man with a good sense of humor, he carried out his work humbly and with a sense of devo-tion to those close to him and to the rest of Connecticut. Howard added inimitable wisdom to the capitol and the courthouse and is known by many of us throughout the State as a tireless supporter of Con-necticut and the Nation’s best inter-ests. His commitment to the rule of law and loyalty to his friends and fam-ily have left a lasting, positive mark on Connecticut’s legacy. My wife, Cynthia, and I extend our deepest sympathies to Howard’s family during this difficult time, particularly to his wife, Ann, and their four chil-dren. May their many wonderful memories of Howard provide them sol-ace and comfort.∑ TRIBUTE TO DR. WILLIAM ‘‘BILL’’ TUCKER ∑Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, today I wish to honor Dr. William Tucker as he celebrates his 90th birthday. Bill is an entrepreneur and former government official and presently serves as presi-dent of Penn Century Corporation. In 1951, Bill married the Honorable C. Delores Tucker, who later went on to become the first African-American woman to serve as Pennsylvania’s Sec-retary of State. As a young man, Bill proudly served in the U.S. Army from 1951 to 1953. Shortly after, he attended Lincoln University where he graduated in 1960 with a bachelor of arts degree. In May 2011, he received an honorary doctorate in humane letters from Lin-coln University. Before retiring from government service in 1991, Bill served as a con-fidential assistant to the U.S. Sec-retary of Commerce during the Carter administration and later served as as-sociate director of the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Office of Business Liai-son, working as an assistant to the sec-retary. Bill provided years of invalu-able service to the Department and em-bodied what it means to be a public servant. Bill went on to become vice chair of the Bethune DuBois Institute, and it was in this role that he founded the an-nual Children’s Christmas Dinner Party for disadvantaged children, first held in Washington, DC. In 2004, through the Philadelphia Martin Lu-ther King, Jr. Association for Non-violence, Inc., he orchestrated the first Annual Children’s Christmas Dinner Party for underserved children from the Philadelphia and surrounding areas at the Wyndham Franklin Plaza Hotel, which serviced over 3,800 children that year. As a committed community activist, Bill has dedicated his life to defending others. He has served as president of the Associated Real Estate Brokers of Philadelphia and a board member of the National Negro Business League, the Urban League of Philadelphia, the Philadelphia Chapter NAACP, and many others. His commitment to help-ing shape his community has been an inspiration to us all. Bill set the prime example of leader-ship and courage during his life. His ac-tivism and many years of community and public service are significant to many who have been touched by his work. I wish Bill a happy 90th birthday and express my gratitude for all the work he has done.∑

50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE RBC HERITAGE PRESENTED BY BOE-ING GOLF TOURNAMENT ∑Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, each year Hilton Head Island in South Caro-lina is proud to host the RBC Heritage Presented by Boeing Golf Tournament at the Harbour Town Golf Links at the Sea Pines Resort. With Harbour Town’s red and white striped lighthouse as a backdrop, a world-class golf tour-nament is held annually the week after the Masters. Our tournament cham-pions have included a notable number of Hall of Fame golfers: Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, Nick Faldo, Hale Irwin, Bernhard Langer, Johnny Miller, Greg Norman, Nick Price, Tom Watson, and Payne Stewart. More than 1,200 volunteers staff the tournament during the week. Their work is felt and seen by the more than a hundred thousand people who attend the tournament every year and the millions more who watch the tour-nament broadcast in 226 countries. Last year, the tournament infused over $96 million into the State of South Carolina’s economy. Even more notable than the golf is the impact the Heritage Classic Foun-dation has on the local communities in South Carolina and Georgia. Since 1987, $38 million has been distributed to those in need in these two States. Since 1993, 322 high school seniors have received more than $4.1 million for 4- year college scholarships. This fall, 34 Beaufort County collegians will receive foundation grants at an expenditure of $159,000. Last year, the foundation helped fa-cilitate more than $2.9 million in dona-tions. The Heritage Champions Fore Charity has produced more than $7.2 million for participating nonprofit groups. Last year, the Birdies for Char-ity program distributed $216,000 in pledge donations, bringing the total to $5.7 million since it was created in 2000. The nonprofit groups that staff the tournament concession stands made $247,706 for their charities in 2017. On behalf of all South Carolinians, I want to express my deep appreciation and congratulations to the RBC Herit-age Presented by Boeing Golf Tour-nament on the occasion of its 50th an-niversary and wish them another suc-cessful tournament this week. ∑ f 
REMEMBERING SHANE QUILLING ∑Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today I wish to memorialize Shane Quilling, Carson High School’s physical edu-cation teacher and head football and softball coach who unexpectedly passed away at the age of 53. Remembered as a compassionate teacher and coach, Mr. Quilling’s loss will have a profound impact on Carson High School and the greater Carson community. As the Reno Gazette Jour-nal recently noted, Coach Quilling’s ‘‘main goal in life was to help make ev-erybody a better person, to strive for their best, no matter what they did in life.’’ Born in Sidney, MT, Mr. Quilling at-tended Sidney High School, where he was a football, track, and basketball athlete.

Fol-lowing his college graduation, Mr. Quilling began his coaching and teach-ing career in Montana, as well as at high schools in Denver, CO, San Anto-nio, TX, and Roy, UT. Before coming to Carson City in 2000, Mr. Quilling also worked at Box Elder High School for 7 years in Brigham, UT, where he won several regional championships and a State championship in 1995. As Nevada’s senior U.S. Senator, I know that Mr. Quilling will be sorely missed by the thousands of students and athletes he came across and mentored during his career. My thoughts and prayers go out to his three children, family, and loved ones during this difficult time.∑

Bush recognized the restoration of their independence, reestab-lishing full diplomatic relations between the United States and Estonia, Latvia, and Lith-uania several days later; Whereas in the United States, commu-nities of Baltic descent have contributed sig-nificantly to American culture, prosperity, and security and have helped strengthen United States relations with the Baltic states; Whereas relations between the United States and Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania have developed into a robust partnership based on shared values and principles, in-cluding respect for the rule of law, human rights, freedom of speech, and free trade; Whereas Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania have shown their resolve as responsible and dedicated members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) by contributing to regional and global security, including to operations in Afghanistan; Whereas the Baltic states have been lead-ers in addressing and combatting 21st cen-tury security threats, exemplified by their active leadership and advancement of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence in Estonia, the NATO Strategic Communications Center of Excellence in Latvia, and the NATO Energy Security Cen-ter of Excellence in Lithuania; and Whereas Russia’s continued aggressive and provocative actions against its neighboring countries, including violations of sovereign Baltic airspace, test both the region and the NATO alliance: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Senate— (1) congratulates the people of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of their declarations of independence; (2) commends the people and Governments of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania for their successful reforms and remarkable economic growth since 1991; (3) applauds the productive partnership the United States enjoys with the Baltic states in many spheres, including NATO; (4) recognizes the determination of the Governments of Estonia, Latvia, and Lith-uania to strengthen transatlantic security through defense spending and host nation support for NATO deployments; (5) commends the Baltic states for their commitment to democracy and respect for human rights and for their leadership in fur-thering these values abroad; and (6) reiterates the continued support of the Senate for the European Deterrence Initia-tive as a means for enhancing deterrence and increasing military capabilities on NATO’s eastern flank. f KEEP AMERICA’S REFUGES OPERATIONAL ACT Mr. M

CONGRATULATING TONKA SWIMMING AND DIVING TEAM 
HON. ERIK PAULSEN 
OF MINNESOTA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 9, 2018 Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Minnetonka High School boys swimming and diving team on its state cham-pionship. It’s the second consecutive cham-pionship for the Skippers, who won their first state championship in 1978 and have taken home the state title nine times since. After winning two individual events and one relay, Minnetonka put up an impressive 217.5 points—beating out Shakopee who was able to tally just 181 points. It’s their first back-to- back title since 1997. I want to recognize Senior Jack Dahlgren for winning first place and setting new state records in both the 200 Free and 100 back-stroke. I also want to commend John Shelstad for winning the 200 IM and Erik Gessner for his victory in the 100 butterfly. A special con-gratulations goes out to the 200 meter free-style relay team of Erik Gessner, Michael Shelstad, Isaac Alberts and John Shelstad for taking first place home for the Skippers. Mr. Speaker, swimming and diving is a sport that takes endurance, extensive training and poise. It’s also important to recognize that these student athletes work hard in the class-room as well. Congratulations to Head Coach Dan Berne, the coaching staff, the parents, the fans and the entire swim and dive team on being state champs.

IN RECOGNITION OF FRANCIS WHITTY 
HON. WILLIAM R. KEATING 
OF MASSACHUSETTS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 9, 2018 Mr. KEATING. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Francis Whitty as he completes his term as Department Commander of the Massachusetts Disabled American Veterans (DAV). Frank was born in Roslindale, Massachu-setts. After graduating high school in 1962 Frank went on to have a successful banking career, working at State Street Bank in Boston as well as at the Federal Reserve. He later moved to Brockton to settle down and raise a family with his wife Mary. Shortly after President Kennedy was assas-sinated, Frank enlisted in the Navy and proud-ly served in the Submarine Service on board the USS Piper (SS409) until 1967. Frank was an early member of the United States Sub-marine Veterans and rose to the office of Na-tional Commander. This was just the start of his service to our country and our veterans. Inspired by his uncle Eddie, a WWII veteran in the 10th Mountain Division, Frank used the help of the DAV and went on to become a member of their Brockton Chapter 76 where he was elected Chapter Commander. He served two terms in this position at a time when the public was far less supportive of vet-erans. Frank spearheaded initiatives to gather support to release prisoners of war in Vietnam and to account for soldiers Missing in Action. He led his chapter of the DAV to become a staple in the Brockton community, very much like Frank himself. This past year, Frank served as Department Commander of the Massachusetts DAV and will now be completing his term. According to Frank, one of his biggest accomplishments during his years of service has been expand-ing the DAV’s outreach to include services to incarcerated veterans and better serve the community at large in Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to honor Frank Whitty for his service and dedication to his community and country. I ask that my col-leagues join me in thanking him for his work and in wishing him the best in his future en-deavors. f 
HONORING EDWARD M CLAUGHLIN 
HON. DWIGHT EVANS 
OF PENNSYLVANIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 9, 2018 Mr. EVANS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Edward McLaughlin, military historian, for his dedicated voluntary service to our vet-eran community. Edward McLaughlin has dedicated the last four years researching and cataloging the in-ternment of over 1,000 Civil War Soldiers and Sailors of African American descent, who are buried at Philadelphia National Cemetery, within the Second Congressional District of Pennsylvania. They were soldiers of the United States Colored Troops, a fierce force of nearly 180,000 men that made up one-tenth of the Union Army during the Civil War. As a volunteer historian, Edward McLaughlin spent a year downloading approx. 25,000 records, mostly from the National Ar-chives as well as other sources. He then cop-ied, sorted, and compartmentalized these records, and then had the information trans-ferred into a book form. Edward McLaughlin’s research contains a 2 to 5-line history of all the African American Civil War soldiers and sailors at the cemetery, photographs of each headstone, as well as a name to plot number. What makes this achievement all the more re-markable is the fact that this history had never been uncovered, until now. After a study of the information for the first year, Edward McLaughlin realized that a storyboard needed to be erected to tell this story and went on a local speaking tour at li-braries, historical societies and veteran’s groups requesting letters of support for a story board, of which I lent my support. Because of his efforts, the National Cemetery Administra-tion has constructed and installed a storyboard dedicated to the memory of the United States Colored Troops interned at Philadelphia Na-tional Cemetery. The storyboard is installed in Section C, which along with the bottom half of Section G, contains the burial plots of the United States Colored Troops interned at Philadelphia National Cemetery. This storyboard joins three others that were installed three years ago at the Philadelphia National Cemetery. One chronicles the 155- year history of the cemetery, founded to re-ceive the bodies of Civil War veterans already interred in nearby graveyards. The other two are dedicated to soldiers buried there: Valley Forge native Galusha Pennypacker, at 20, the youngest-ever brigadier general, and 184 Con-federate soldiers wounded at the Battle of Gettysburg who died at nearby hospitals. Without Edward McLaughlin’s expertise and tireless efforts, this proud chapter in American History would surely have been lost. The 2nd Congressional District of Pennsyl-vania extends gratitude to Edward McLaughlin for his dedicated support and service to the Second Congressional District of Pennsyl-vania. f 
OATH OF CITIZENSHIP ON APRIL 13, 2018 
HON. PETER J. VISCLOSKY 
OF INDIANA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 9, 2018 Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure and sincerity that I take this time to congratulate thirty individuals who will take their oaths of citizenship on April 13, 2018. This memorable occasion will be held at the United States Courthouse and Federal Building in Hammond, Indiana. America is a country founded by immi-grants. From its beginning, settlers have come from countries around the world to the United States in search of better lives for their fami-lies. Oath ceremonies are a shining example of what is so great about the United States of America—that people from all over the world can come together and unite as members of a free, democratic nation. These individuals realize that nowhere else in the world offers a better opportunity for success than here in America. On April 13, 2018, the following people, rep-resenting many nations throughout the world, will take their oaths of citizenship in Ham-mond, Indiana: Maria Rebolloso, Pablo Serrano, Armando Martinez, Cristina Olivia Vasquez, Ricardo Rivera, Alejandra Sandoval, Yang-Yi Avia Lin Shemesh, Juliana Isabel Mercado Velazquez, Leticia Luna Swinson, Benjamin Tovar Lopez, Angelica Magallon de Amezcua, Mercedes Lorenzo de Diaz, Haroldas Vysniauskas, Octavia Guijosa Granados, Manoel Jacques Etienne Couder, Alejandrina Perez de Davila, Mohammad Yousef Mustafa Hijaz, Ma del Carmen

Barajas, Aida Batisse Tamba, Mamoon Arif Raza, Irene Patrick, Cordelia Eruaga, Zilha Basic, Bore Trajkovski, Milan Sorgic, Ann- Marie Thomas, Muhammad Rizwan Ashraf, Isabel Cristina Padilla, Georges El Howayek, and Zubair Ul Haq. Although each individual has sought to be-come a citizen of the United States for his or her own reasons, be it for education, occupa-tion, or to offer their loved ones better lives, each is inspired by the fact that the United States of America is, as Abraham Lincoln de-scribed it, a country ‘‘. . . of the people, by the people, and for the people.’’ They realize that the United States is truly a free nation. By seeking American citizenship, they have made the decision that they want to live in a place where, as guaranteed by the First Amendment of the Constitution, they can practice religion as they choose, speak their minds without fear of punishment, and assemble in peaceful pro-test should they choose to do so. Mr. Speaker, I respectfully ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in congratulating these individuals who will be-come citizens of the United States ofAmerica on April 13, 2018. They, too, are American citizens, guaranteed the inalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. We, as a free and democratic nation, congratulate them and welcome them.

IN RECOGNITION OF BRADFORD HOLMES 
HON. WILLIAM R. KEATING 
OF MASSACHUSETTS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 9, 2018 Mr. KEATING. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Bradford Holmes as he receives a Prisoner-Of-War medal for his service and sacrifice during World War II. Bradford was born on September 29, 1925 and now resides in Onset, MA. Growing up he worked for a cranberry company. At the age of eighteen, Bradford was drafted into the United States Army, following the footsteps of his older brother. Bradford started at Fort Devens in Massa-chusetts and then trained at several bases across the country, eventually ending up in Camp Atterbury in Indiana, where he joined the 106th division. He was later shipped over-seas to England to receive more training. Bradford then headed through Belgium to the front lines as a part of the 423rd Regiment. Moving through wood lines and digging fox holes through the frozen ground, they made their way to the front, but they were sur-rounded and Bradford was captured during the Battle of the Bulge on December 17, 1944. They walked for several days through snow, sleeping by the side of the road at night. They spent the holidays locked in train cars and his train was attacked by the Allies, not realizing that POWs were on board. Bradford was taken to the German POW Camp, Stalag IV–B, where he volunteered to go on a work detail to escape the horrible con-ditions of the camp. Bradford was sent to start working in a furniture factory. Here he looked forward to air raids because they caused fac-tory workers to flee and gave him an oppor-tunity to run and find food. Later he and other POWs were forced to cut down and haul out trees in the mountains. Even with three men on each side of the tree, this was incredibly difficult and dangerous. They lost many men as a result. As air raids increased, they were forced to walk fifteen miles to the border of Czechoslovakia. Finally, they were abandoned by their captors as the Red Army advanced and the POWs followed German civilians to al-lied territory. After returning to the United States, Brad-ford got married and started a family of his own. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to honor Bradford Holmes for his service and dedication to his country.
