Senate 
The Senate met at 2 p.m. and was called to order by the Honorable T
ODD Y
OUNG , a Senator from the State of In-diana. 
f 
PRAYER The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-fered the following prayer: Let us pray. Almighty God, from the rising of the Sun to the coming of the evening, we lift Your Name in grateful praise. Surround our lawmakers with the power of Your presence, sustaining them in their challenging world. Lord, strengthen them to do what is right so that our Nation will be exalted by Your love. Empower them to treat one an-other with respect and honor. Teach them to hate what is evil and to cling to what is good. Remind them of how fleeting are the days of their lives as You give them the wisdom to prepare for eternity. Eternal Father, we exalt You and praise Your Name, for in perfect faith-fulness You continue to expose us to the unfolding of Your loving provi-dence. We pray in Your marvelous Name. Amen.

ATCH ). The senior assistant legislative clerk read the following letter: U.S. S ENATE , P
RESIDENT PRO TEMPORE , Washington, DC, May 8, 2017. To the Senate: Under the provisions of rule I, paragraph 3, of the Standing Rules of the Senate, I hereby appoint the Honorable T
ODD YOUNG , a Sen- ator from the State of Indiana, to perform the duties of the Chair. O
RRIN G. H ATCH , President pro tempore. 
Mr. YOUNG thereupon assumed the Chair as Acting President pro tempore.

RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-pore. Under the previous order, the leadership time is reserved.

CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-pore. Morning business is closed.

EXECUTIVE SESSION 
EXECUTIVE CALENDAR The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-pore. Under the previous order, the Senate will proceed to executive ses-sion to consider the following nomina-tion, which the clerk will report. The senior assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Heather Wilson, of South Dakota, to be Secretary of the Air Force. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-pore. Under the previous order, there will be 4 hours of debate, equally di-vided in the usual form. Who yields time? If no one yields time, time will be charged equally to both sides. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER  
The majority leader is recognized. Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, today the Senate will move to confirm Heather Wilson as Secretary of the Air Force. Wilson is a Rhodes Scholar, Air Force Academy graduate—part of the third class ever to admit women, by the way—and a dedicated public serv-ant who served several terms in the U.S. House. I am sure she will work hard in this new role to strengthen the branch of the military she cares so much about. I look forward to approving her nomi-nation on a bipartisan basis later this afternoon. After that, we will take a cloture vote on the Gottlieb nomination to head the FDA, which I will come to in a moment. I hope to see robust support for his nomination as well. HEALTHCARE LEGISLATION  
Mr. President, I would like to recog-nize two important votes that occurred last Thursday. First, let me commend the House for voting to move beyond the pain of ObamaCare. For years, the American people have suffered under this failed law. They watched their pre-miums soar. They watched their choices dwindle. Now they are watching as ObamaCare collapses all around them. More than half of our States have counties with only a single insurance option on the exchanges, and a growing number could have no options at all— like, as we saw reported just last week, in nearly every single county in Iowa. That means thousands more Americans could be left trapped, forced by law to purchase ObamaCare insurance but left without the means to do so. Does that sound like a law that is working to anyone? To those who would try to defend an indefensible status quo, I ask you to consider what Speaker R
YAN said last week: 
[T]here is a fundamental and urgent choice at the heart of this debate. We can continue with the status quo under ObamaCare, and we know what that looks like. It means even higher premiums, even fewer choices, even more insurance companies pulling out, even more uncertainty, and even more chaos.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES2786 May 8, 2017 
To those who suffered enough al-ready, my message is this: We hear you. Congress is acting. I commend the House and the admin-istration for making this important ad-vance last week. Now the Senate will do its work. The administration will also continue doing its part to deliver relief and stabilize the healthcare mar-kets as best it can. This process will not be quick or simple or easy, but it must be done. It is the least Members of both parties owe to the countless of Americans who continue to suffer under Obamacare, and the countless more who will be hurt if we don’t act. 
GOVERNMENT FUNDING LEGISLATION  
Mr. President, second, let me com-mend the Senate for voting last Thurs-day to pass the funding bill. I men-tioned last week some of the many im-portant provisions it contained, all of which the President has now signed into law. The largest border-security funding increase in a decade—now law. The critically needed down payment on restoring our military readiness—now law. The bill also kept in place an impor-tant free speech protection. Yet Demo-crats are now trying to pressure and in-timidate the SEC into ignoring some-thing we just passed on a bipartisan basis. For years, Democrats have pres-sured the SEC rulemaking process to curb and regulate political speech, de-spite agreement in our funding bills to prevent the Commission from doing just that. This is not a new page in their play-book. When we first passed this crucial protection in 2015, Democrats appealed to the SEC to actually ignore the law. This time, however, they have gone in an even more extreme direction. Now the Democrats no longer have the ad-ministration to stifle speech through the SEC, the IRS, or HHS. They are trying to intimidate private citizens and public companies by telling those citizens and companies what is in their ‘‘best interest.’’ This kind of bullying behavior is part of a broader pattern we have seen repeated by the left time and again in similar circumstances— suppression of the viewpoints with which they disagree and forcing Ameri-cans into a choice: Tell us your polit-ical ideology or be silent. I have called the left out for intimi-dation tactics and speech suppression efforts before. I am warning them again today, and I will continue to stay vigilant and defend the First Amend-ment moving forward. For now, I would like to highlight a couple of other important provisions in the funding bill that are now law. One is the miners’ health provision I was proud to secure, a critical lifeline that will permanently protect healthcare benefits for thousands of retired coal miners in States like Kentucky. Another is the provision of signifi-cant new resources that can be used to combat the prescription opioid and her-oin crisis. It is the latest of many sig-nificant steps we have taken to tackle this terrible epidemic. Today, we can take another step for-ward by advancing the nomination of Scott Gottlieb to head the FDA. I will have more to say on Dr. Gottlieb later, but for now, I will note that he is in-credibly qualified for this position, and I am sure he will be an ally for States that continue to struggle with the opioid crisis because the FDA has a critical role to play. Let’s be clear, there is a lot more to be done. States like Kentucky have been hit hard by this crisis, especially our rural communities. In fact, there are a lot of struggles that are particu-larly pressing in rural America, and several provisions in the government funding bill that can help—provisions to, for instance, advance broadband de-velopment, promote safe and clean drinking water, and to help reclaim and develop abandoned mine sites in coal country, among other priorities. Those are just a few of the things that can help rural communities. There are other actions we can take as well. One is of particular importance to our colleagues from Alaska, Sen-ators M
URKOWSKI and S ULLIVAN . Major-ity Whip C
ORNYN and I have been con-sulting with them about the Secure Rural Schools Program, which helps rural counties and schools whose economies have been hit hard by steep-ly declining timber revenues from our public lands. Senators H
ATCH and W
YDEN introduced a bill to reauthorize the program just last week, and it was referred to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, where Senator M
URKOWSKI is the chair. This bill is im-portant to Kentucky, as well. I look forward to working with Chairman M
URKOWSKI , Senator S ULLIVAN , and all the bill’s advocates to find a path for-ward for it this year. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-pore. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-pore. Without objection, it is so or-dered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER  
The Democratic leader is recognized. 
GOVERNMENT FUNDING LEGISLATION  
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first I want to thank the majority leader for speaking about the agreement that the House and Senate came to on the ap-propriations bills, the spending bills. We may not agree on emphasis and what the most important things are, but we certainly agree that it was a good effort that moved things forward, and I was proud to be part of it. 
KENTUCKY DERBY  
Mr. President, I note another thing that might tie the majority leader and the minority leader together—pride in Saturday’s Kentucky Derby. The ma-jority leader is very proud of the Ken-tucky Derby. It is one of the leading events in his State. I know he attends religiously. I am particularly proud because the horse that won was owned and trained and guided by two Brooklynites. I sa-lute them for their success. Vinnie Viola, one of the two, is a close friend of mine. I have known him for a long time, and I know him well. As many of you know, he was being considered for Secretary of the Army. He would have been a good one. He withdrew because of the financial issues that he was too involved in with companies he owned, but he is a good man. He comes from St. Cecilia’s Parish on the Greenpoint- Williamsburg border of Brooklyn. We are all proud and hope that his horse goes all the way. Maybe I can be at Belmont and see him win the Triple Crown. Anyway, that is a nice link be-tween the majority leader and the mi-nority leader. FRENCH PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION  
Mr. President, yesterday, the people of France took part in a time-honored tradition of a democratic people: the election of a new President. We here in the Senate congratulate Emmanuel Macron on his win and look forward to the continuing deep and longstanding friendship between our two countries. Unfortunately, the elections in France were victim to a malicious at-tempt to distort the results through a coordinated cyber attack on one of the candidates, much as Hillary Clinton’s campaign was targeted in our elec-tions. In the waning days of the French election, according to reports, Macron’s emails were hacked and leaked to the public, potentially with some altered information included, by agents believed to originate in Russia. The hack was then promoted and spread by far-right activists around the globe, some of whom reside here in the United States. It was deja vu all over again. Russia elevated old school prop-aganda tactics and techniques using new school methods, spreading misin-formation with an army of paid ‘‘trolls’’ and computer bots, aided and abetted by far-right activists here in the United States. It seems that Putin and the inter-national far right have formed an un-holy alliance. The goal of this alliance is not necessarily to promote one can-didate over another, one party over an-other, though that is part of it. Their true goal is to destabilize and subvert democratic societies, to cast doubt on the outcome of free and fair elections, to hobble democratically elected lead-ers before they even take office, and to degrade the alliances and international regimes that have created so much sta-bility, strength, and shared prosperity in the post-World War II era. Despite Macron’s win yesterday, we would be foolish to think that this un-holy alliance will not use the same tac-tics again in upcoming European elec-tions and, even more important to those of us in this country, in upcom-ing American elections.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2787 May 8, 2017 
Make no mistake about it—Mr. Putin has no loyalty to any one person or President. Whatever is good for Russia at the moment, whatever hurts the United States the most, that is what he will pursue. This is an issue that should provoke grave concern in both parties. He may favor one party one day and another party the next. It should compel us, together—Democrats and Republicans—to take action against this new threat. This afternoon, the Judiciary Com-mittee will hear from former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates and former Director of National Intel-ligence James Clapper. Later this week, the Intelligence Committee will hold its annual worldwide threats hear-ing. I sincerely hope these two commit-tees will cover these issues in their hearings and beyond. We should begin an extended bipar-tisan discussion about how to combat foreign information operations cam-paigns and safeguard the integrity of democratic elections all over the world and, most importantly, in our own country. It is no less serious than this: The integrity of our democracy, which has thrived, blessedly, for over 240 years could well be at stake. 
TRUMPCARE  
Now, Mr. President, on healthcare, last week House Republicans passed the latest version of TrumpCare after a failed attempt earlier this year. When they see this version, the majority of Americans will think it is even worse than the first version. This partisan bill will dramatically increase the cost of health insurance for those who need it most, including older Americans, and lower the quality of coverage. TrumpCare would mean 24 million fewer Americans will be without health insurance. It would hike premiums by 20 percent in the first few years, and average costs for the middle class could go up by more than $1,500 a year. Middle- class people can’t afford that kind of money. If you are struggling to make it into the middle class, TrumpCare could raise your costs by up to $4,000, putting you in an even worse pickle. It makes it possible for insurers to charge older Americans as much as five times the amount they charge younger people, and States could make this ratio even greater if they wanted. Under the first TrumpCare bill, some-one making about $20,000 could have his or her—someone who is 63 years old—premiums go up from something like $1,500 or $2,000 all the way to over $10,000 a year. This will be devastating for senior citizens, those 50 to 65. At 65, they get Medicare. They are in decent shape. But when they are older and not under Medicare, they could get clob-bered by this bill after working so hard. And that is the time when you start getting susceptible to so many se-rious illnesses. TrumpCare would devastate our rural areas by decimating Medicaid, which rural areas rely on. Limiting subsidies to lower income Americans, many of whom live in rural areas, TrumpCare would put insurance for rural Ameri-cans even further out of reach. Many rural hospitals are the largest employers in their areas. We have many in New York State, in Upstate New York. They would be shortchanged by this bill. These hospitals—often the largest employers in our rural counties and the only providers of healthcare for scores and sometimes hundreds of miles around—might be forced to lay off thousands of workers. Many of these rural hospital leaders say that if TrumpCare passed, they would have to close. There would be hundreds out of work in an area where it is not easy to find work, and for those who don’t work in the hospitals, it would be hard-er to get to the hospitals. We all know how important it is to get there quick-ly when, God forbid, a stroke or some other serious illness occurs. Maybe most troubling of all, TrumpCare would now eliminate cru-cial consumer protections in our healthcare system, including the ones that protect Americans with pre-existing conditions. Every family in this country knows someone who has a preexisting condition. That sounds like a fancy word. What does it mean? Dia-betes, chronic asthma, cancer, things like that. If you live in a State that opts out of this requirement, you will have to jump through so many hoops to maintain access to care, and even then it likely won’t be affordable. It is un-imaginable. You are a parent. Let’s say you are 40 years old, husband and wife, and your child gets cancer. You can’t get the coverage that under present law the insurance company has to give you or keep with you, and you watch your child suffer. That is inhumane. How, for ideological purposes, the folks in the House could have first eliminated it and now made it almost unattainable for so many millions of Americans—unfathomable. We fixed the problem in our healthcare system because we had heard so many horrible stories. The Republican bill brings it back from the dead. The way the House bill was put to-gether in such a secretive and slapdash way, it is barely legislation. It well could be a menace to millions of Amer-ican families. It means that the Senate should not even come close to passing a bill like this. It makes healthcare for working families, rural Americans, older Americans, and veterans much poorer and at the same time gives mas-sive tax breaks to the wealthy. Some say that is the motivation of some in the House. To pay for these tax breaks for people making over $250,000 a year— and they get a big break—cut back healthcare on everybody else or on so many others. That is wrong. That is wrong. It does, frankly, exactly the opposite of everything President Trump prom-ised he would do on healthcare. He said: Lower costs, better care, insuring everyone. His words. President Trump said he would not cut Medicare or Med-icaid. His bill does both. TrumpCare is a giant broken promise for the working people, the hard-working people of this great country of ours. House Republicans rushed it through without hearings and without much de-bate or even a final CBO score. The final version was posted 8 hours before Members had to vote on it. Some of the very same Republicans who during the ObamaCare debate chanted ‘‘Read the bill’’ didn’t even look at the final legis-lation, let alone study it. That is a breathtakingly irresponsible thing to do on a bill that will affect almost one- fifth of our economy and the healthcare of millions of Americans. I am not surprised our Republican col-leagues wanted to rush it through. The more the American people see it, the less they will like it, just like with their first bill, which is why the first bill didn’t pass and why the second one is in so much trouble here in the Sen-ate. To borrow Speaker RYAN’s catch-phrase, there is a better way to reform our healthcare system. Instead of a partisan process, rushing through bills in the dead of night—no hearings, no debate, no score, no input from the other party—both parties could start working together on improving our healthcare system. Now that the bill is in the Senate’s hands, we hope the Republican major-ity will pursue a bipartisan approach. If they drop their repeal efforts, which are already causing such uncertainty that insurers are pledging to hike rates on Americans next year, we Democrats are willing to work with our Repub-lican colleagues to improve our healthcare system. In the last few years, we have made a good deal of progress. We have made major improvements in our healthcare system, expanding coverage for over 20 million Americans, bending the cost curve, and protecting folks with pre-existing conditions. Why don’t we keep all the good things we have in the sys-tem and work on making it even better in a bipartisan way? We want to im-prove quality, lower costs, reduce the price of prescription drugs, and expand coverage for all Americans. Unfortu-nately, the House bill does exactly the opposite. I hope my Republican friends toss this House bill out the window and re-sist the temptation to follow the same partisan, rushed process. I hope my friends on the other side of aisle drop repeal, which is hurting our healthcare system right now—just the threat of it—and start working with Democrats to make our healthcare better. 
PARIS AGREEMENT  
Finally, Mr. President, a word on the Paris climate agreement. Reports have indicated that the Trump administra-tion is leaning toward withdrawing the United States from the Paris climate agreement. This would be a historic misstep that would massively dis-advantage both American businesses

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES2788 May 8, 2017 
and diplomats. It would damage our standing on the world stage and allow China to take the high moral ground and the economic upper hand in com-batting climate change. Most impor-tantly, a great step forward made by President Obama to get the entire world community to work in a coordi-nated and concerted effort to reduce carbon pollution so that the United States does not have to bear the bur-den and so that China would do much more than it has done—all that would be undone in one fell swoop. Europe and other countries have warned the Trump administration that abandoning the Paris Agreement could lead to carbon tariffs on U.S. goods, stymying access to global markets for our companies and undercutting our trade position. That is why hundreds of American companies, including 28 For-tune 100 CEOs representing 9 million jobs, support the climate agreement. There is a giant difference between putting America first and making America an international pariah. The latter approach only undermines our power and erodes our standing in the world. Right now, there are only two countries in the world that are not par-ties to the Paris Agreement—Syria and Nicaragua, the latter of which objects because they feel the agreement is not strong enough. Climate change is real. It is driven by human activity. It is happening right now. These are facts. They are not in dispute. Our scientists know it, our businesses know it, the world knows it, and the American people who have ex-perienced such changes in weather and climate know it too. The United States needs to have a seat at the table as the world works together to solve this exis-tential challenge. I strongly encourage the administra-tion to rethink its position and remain in the agreement. I yield the floor. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-pore. The Senator from Florida. 
REPUBLICAN HEALTHCARE BILL  
Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I want to talk as well about the Republican healthcare plan and point out why it is moving on very treacherous territory when it will affect the funding of Med-icaid by lessening the amount of Med-icaid money that will be spent in the States, because so much of that Med-icaid money is going to address the opioid crisis. The opioid crisis, we found last year—you know, there was a lot of talk about it being in New Hampshire when the eyes of America were on New Hampshire in the New Hampshire pri-mary. But the fact is, it is in every State now. It is particularly so in my State of Florida. There are something like 2,600 deaths that have occurred in Florida as a result of opioid overdoses. So the seriousness with which we are addressing this issue ought to be of ex-treme concern, and we ought to be doing something about it. Yet a bill just passed by the House of Representa-tives is doing exactly the opposite. It is going to cut Medicaid. It is a fancy term, cutting Medicaid with a block grant. What it means is that it is going to be capped. That means a State is not going to get any more Medicaid once that cap has been hit, unless the State responds. So, in essence, it is going to cost the States more money. I don’t think you will find many States that are in such a fiscal condition that, in fact, they could do that. So what are we doing? We are harm-ing poor people and the disabled who get their healthcare from Medicare and Medicaid. In fact, we are not only harming all of them, but addressing the opioid crisis will be particularly hurt. What I want to talk about today is the Republican healthcare plan that passed out of the House last week. This plan is going to increase costs for older Americans. Remember, it is going to go on a ratio. Instead of 1 to 3, or older Americans being charged three times as much in health insurance as young-er Americans, it is going to go up to a ratio of at least 1 to 5, and maybe more. So it is going to increase costs for older Americans. It is going to cut Medicaid, and it is going to take healthcare coverage away from tens of millions of people. Right now as a result of the ACA, there are 24 million people who have health insurance coverage who did not have it before this law was passed in 2010. It is going to reverse that. Do we want to take away healthcare from people who can now have healthcare through Medicaid and/or health insur-ance because they can now afford health insurance? Is that really a goal the United States wants to do—to take away healthcare through private health insurance? I don’t think that is what we want to do, but that is what the House of Representatives’ Repub-lican healthcare bill has done. If we just look at my State of Flor-ida, there are almost 8 million people who have a so-called preexisting condi-tion. This includes something as com-mon as asthma. That is a preexisting condition. As a former elected insur-ance commissioner of Florida, I can tell you that some insurance compa-nies would use as an excuse as a pre-existing condition something as simple as a rash and say: Because you have a preexisting condition, we are not going to insure you. Under the existing law, the Affordable Care Act, an insurance company cannot deny you with a pre-existing condition. Just in my State alone, there are almost 8 million peo-ple who have a preexisting condition. Are we going to turn them out on the streets because their insurance com-pany says they are not going to carry them anymore? I don’t think that is what we want to do. The bill allows insurers to charge older Americans at least five times more than what they charge younger adults. Is that what we want to do? What is the principle of insurance? The principle of insurance is that you spread the risk. You get as many peo-ple in the pool as you can—young, old, sick, healthy—and you spread that risk. If you get fire insurance on your home, you are paying a premium every month and the insurance company has calculated in an actuarial calculation what it is going to cost you to insure, and you are part of hundreds of thou-sands of people in that pool who are also insuring against fire damaging their house. It is the same principle with health insurance. So you get young and old, sick and well, and some people with preexisting conditions, and you spread that risk over a lot of peo-ple. One of the fallacies we hear is that we can create this by creating a high- risk pool. In other words, we are going to set up some money for people who have really sick conditions, and we are going to take care of them. That is the most inefficient way to do it because insurance is about spreading risk, not concentrating risk, which is what a high-risk pool exactly is. So the House of Representatives, which has con-cocted this thing called the Republican healthcare plan, has come up with ex-actly the opposite idea of funding—in-stead of spreading the risk, concen-trating the risk, and then saying that they are going out and getting $8 bil-lion and that is going to pay for it. It is not even going to touch it. It is the most inefficient way to approach the subject of spreading risk, because they don’t spread the risk. They concentrate the risk. What this bill does is that over 10 years it cuts over $800 billion out of Medicaid. You start doing that, and you are going to lose what we know of as Medicaid, a healthcare program pri-marily for the poor and the disabled. By the way, isn’t it interesting that they cut over $800 billion and save it out of Medicaid, and what did they do in the same bill? They give upwards of $600 billion in tax breaks to those who are at the highest income levels. Let me get this right. It is kind of a re-versed Robin Hood. I am going to take from the poor by cutting $800 billion, and I am going to give to the rich by tax breaks for the highest income folks. Is that what we want to do? I don’t think so. Medicaid is a program that guaran-tees healthcare for millions of Ameri-cans, including children, people with disabilities, pregnant women, and sen-iors on long-term care. Think about that. What am I talking about? It is seniors in long-term care, seniors in nursing homes, who don’t have enough resources or enough assets in order to pay for their care in their twilight years. Therefore, they are being paid by Medicaid, and that is the only source of income to take care of them. Is that what we want to cut in order to give a tax break for the highest income group? It ought to be the reverse. That is upside-down thinking. Last week the Florida Medical Exam-iners Commission released new data

showing that over 2,600 Floridians have died from opioids in just the first half of 2016 alone. Over the entire year be-fore, 2015, fentanyl, an opioid, killed 705 Floridians. Just in the first half of 2016, almost the exact same number, 704, died. We have a problem in the State of Florida, and there are a lot of other States that have the same. Last month I went to a research in-stitute down in Palm Beach County. They are using NIH grant money to re-search new nonaddictive opioid drugs. If they can come up with this, that is certainly all for the better to help peo-ple with pain and so that they are not being given an addictive drug. But we are not there yet, and we are using NIH money that is going into that research. Last month I sent a letter to the Re-publican leadership pushing for more funding for the opioid fight and for the National Institutes of Health, or NIH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-sent to have that letter printed in the R

AULRYAN, Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. D
EAR LEADER MCCONNELL AND SPEAKER  R
YAN: As negotiations over the latest stop-gap government funding measure continue, we urge you to focus on securing substantial funding in the appropriations legislation currently being negotiated for two of our most essential national priorities: fighting the opioid epidemic and investing in our na-tion’s biomedical research programs. Every day, 91 Americans die from an opioid overdose, and despite the tireless work of many in our communities, this public health epidemic is only getting worse. Currently, only 10 percent of individuals who need spe-cialty treatment for substance use disorder actually get it—not because we don’t know how to help, but in large part because there aren’t enough funds to provide these serv-ices. We need substantial additional re-sources to fight this epidemic and fund pre-vention, treatment, and recovery activities. It is also essential that we increase our in-vestment in the National Institutes of Health (NIH), our nation’s premier research institution. NIH funding supports innova-tive, cutting-edge research that plays a crit-ical role in the development of lifesaving cures for diseases. Our ability to fight Alz-heimer’s disease, diabetes, cancer, heart dis-ease, and many other diseases depends on our willingness to invest in science. While investments in the NIH have consistently produced tremendous value, funding for the NIH has failed to keep pace with inflation over the last several decades. It is essential to provide new funding to fight the opioid epidemic and support bio-medical research at the NIH. This new fund-ing should not fill in for cuts made elsewhere to opioid and NIH funding. It is also essen-tial that opioid funding be distributed to the communities that need it must and that have been hardest hit by this terrible public health epidemic. While past Congresses have made promises about providing states with additional fund-ing to address the ongoing opioid crisis, ap-propriations legislation like the pending budget deal is where the bill comes due. Americans are counting on Congress to live up to its commitments by supporting fund-ing for the priorities that matter most in their lives. Funding to fight the opioid epi-demic and support research into lifesaving cures through the NIH rank at the top of this list, and we urge you to include substantial additional funding for these areas in the ap-propriations legislation now being nego-tiated. Sincerely, Senator Elizabeth Warren, Senator Bill Nelson, Senator Benjamin L. Cardin, Senator Tom Udall, Senator Dianne Feinstein, Sen-ator Debbie Stabenow, Senator Sherrod Brown, Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Senator Al Franken, Senator Richard Blumenthal, Sen-ator Edward J. Markey, Senator Chris Van Hollen, Senator Margaret Wood Hassan, Sen-ator Christopher Murphy, Senator Joe Manchin III, Senator Tammy Baldwin, Sen-ator Cory A. Booker, Senator Tammy Duckworth, Senator Bernard Sanders. Mr. NELSON. So what we need to do is to take a comprehensive approach to helping our State and local govern-ments respond to this opioid epidemic. I was very happy to be an early part of putting together and sponsoring a bill called the Comprehensive Addic-tion and Recovery Act of 2016 and of the funding included in the 21st Cen-tury Cures Act to start putting more resources into our States right away for this opioid epidemic. Those laws have resulted in Florida’s receiving more than $27 million to help our State respond to the opioid crisis. Yet a lot more action is needed, as you can see by just the first half of last year alone, with 704 people dying from opioid overdoses. Last week, in Florida a local paper reported about how the opioid epidemic is affecting our Nation’s children. In 2015 alone, 167 babies were born in opioid dependency in just one city— Jacksonville—contributing to Duval County’s being tapped as having the second highest number of babies born addicted to opioids in the State. Isn’t that sad that children come into this world and they are already addicted? We are dealing with people’s lives here. We are dealing with their health. The last thing in the world we ought to be doing is cutting the resources of funding to help people who are in such dire straits. I would urge our col-leagues to think twice about sup-porting this disastrous Republican healthcare bill. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-pore. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-pore. Without objection, it is so or-dered. 
PARIS AGREEMENT  
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, on De-cember 19, 2015, in Paris, France, dip-lomats representing more than 190 countries finalized the world’s most ambitious, comprehensive, and achiev-able multilateral agreement to combat climate change at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change’s 21st Conference of Parties, or COP21. I led a delegation of 10 Senators to COP21 to bolster U.S. leadership and to provide confidence in the U.S. commit-ment to the global effort to fight the existential threat of climate change. The result was an agreement that has nearly universal support, with every party committed to reducing carbon emissions. The momentum coming out of COP21 felt unstoppable. That momentum continued through 2016. On Earth Day, an impressive 175 nations signed the Paris Agreement. Six months later, and in less than a year’s time, the Paris Agreement reached the threshold for entry into force. Up until recently, the United States has led this global effort. The strength of our commitment and diplo-macy spurred global enthusiasm for the Paris Agreement. Some have said that we are the first generation to feel the effects of climate change and the last generation who can do something about it. Climate change impacts are apparent in my home State of Maryland. Recently, Annap-olis began experiencing routine tidal flooding. Today’s generations of Smith Islanders may be the last as a rising Chesapeake Bay encroaches further ashore each year. Around the world, climate change is expanding the range and duration of re-gional wildfire seasons, prolonging ex-treme droughts in the Middle East and Southern Africa, which I have wit-nessed firsthand, and has caused Boliv-ia’s Lake Poopo to evaporate entirely, and entire island nations are being swallowed up by the South Pacific. The good news is, acting to prevent the worst effects of climate change holds tremendous economic and job growth opportunities for our Nation. The world looks toward the United States for leadership, not just in terms of domestic emissions reductions but also in our private sector and academia for clean energy solutions to power the world. Maryland is positioned to be at the forefront of U.S. leadership in tech-nology innovation. For example, the University of Mary-land, in partnership with the U.S. De-partment of Energy and a number of Maryland private sector companies like Redox Energy, are leading the way in developing commercial-scale, in-de-mand technology that the global en-ergy market is demanding. In 2015, global investment in renew-able energy was nearly $350 billion, which was more than the global invest-ment in fossil fuel energy. The Depart-ment of Energy’s 2017 U.S. Energy and Employment Report showed that near-ly 1 million Americans work in the en-ergy efficiency, solar, wind, and alter-native vehicles sectors. This is almost five times the current employment in

the U.S. fossil fuel electric industry, which includes coal, gas, and oil work-ers. Even though gas and oil have hit record-low prices on the global market, current and projected price per watt for renewables is also low, making clean energy remarkably affordable and competitive in the market. The United States stands at the crossroads of global clean energy and climate change leadership, and the pol-icy path we take on these issues could not only shape the strength of our eco-nomic future but our overall standing in the world. Forward thinking domes-tic climate change and clean energy policy, including substantial invest-ments in clean energy R&D and clean energy production incentives, have made the United States an incubator for clean energy investment and entre-preneurship. We see these things in every State of the Nation—new innovators and inves-tors in the clean energy sector. Creating a robust domestic market helps U.S. companies develop tested records of accomplishment, skilled workforces, and scalable products to export around the world to a global en-ergy market that is hungry for clean energy solutions. This is where domes-tic policy intersects with U.S. climate diplomacy, which is priming that ex-port market by building good will and faith in U.S. capacity and commit-ment. The United States must not squander the considerable time and effort it took to build the world’s confidence in the United States when combating cli-mate change. The rejection of the Kyoto Protocol by the United States severely strained a wide range of diplomacy issues for the Bush administration. That is not just a Senator saying this. Let me quote Secretary of State Colin Powell, when he stated: 
Kyoto—this is not talking out of school— was not handled as well as it should have been, and when the blowback came I think it was a sobering experience that everything the American president does has inter-national repercussions. 
That was General Powell warning us about the importance of international diplomacy and that our actions have consequences. Hindsight on the impact U.S. partici-pation in Kyoto would have had on the protocol’s success and on the U.S. economy is another debate entirely— and we will leave that for a different day—but a clear lesson from the epi-sode is that the United States must not underestimate how seriously the world takes the issue of international co-operation to combat climate change. Should the Trump administration withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement, it will be an incred-ible insult to our global partners and severely tarnish the trust nations have in the United States. That distrust will bleed over into all areas of U.S. diplo-macy and cooperation. While the Paris Agreement does not have enforceable, binding provisions that would punish parties for missing self-determined mitigation targets, nothing precludes other countries from acting outside the confines of the agreement to create uncomfortable conditions for nonmembers. It is worth noting here that if we were to pull out, we would be in a club with Syria and Nicaragua. For example, in November of last year, immediately after the election and during COP22, the New York Times reported that leaders from other coun-tries—so deeply offended by the Presi-dent-elect’s ill-informed rhetoric on climate change and the Paris Agree-ment—were contemplating imple-menting border tariffs on goods im-ported from nations failing to account for carbon emissions. Staying in the agreement and con-tinuing to advocate for what is in the best interests of the United States could prevent countries from taking such actions. Many critics of the Paris Agreement sound as though they are stuck in 1997, echoing concerns about the 20-year-old Kyoto Protocol that are simply untrue about the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement takes a different approach to international climate change co-operation by creating an action model that allows for ambitious action and accountability through peer review. The agreement takes a radically dif-ferent approach to pollution mitiga-tion that incorporates many conserv-ative principles our Republican col-leagues routinely espouse: increased transparency and universal reporting requirements for all parties. All par-ties, both developing and developed na-tions, commit to reducing greenhouse gas pollution. All parties determine their own greenhouse gas pollution mitigation commitments. Nationally determined commitments are non-binding. Let me repeat that. The nationally determined commitments are non-binding. It is up to us, our country, to determine how we will meet our tar-gets and when we will meet our tar-gets, and the enforcement is solely within our own means. No inter-national group can enforce any of these commitments on us. That was at the request of many Members of this body, and that was followed in the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement was forged by the lessons the United States learned from the Kyoto Protocol process. Each addressed commonly criticized ele-ments of the Kyoto Protocol. I cannot stress enough how seriously committed leaders around the world are to the success of the Paris Agree-ment. For example, it is the top agenda item for both the upcoming G7 and G20 meetings. As such, we absolutely can-not underestimate how thoroughly in-sulted our friends and allies around the world will be if the United States re-treats from the agreement. Make no mistake, callously dis-regarding cooperation and partnership with the global community on a crisis that is literally threatening the very physical existence of countries will have consequences for our foreign pol-icy, diplomacy, national security, and U.S. economic opportunity in an unde-niably globalized economy. Retreating from the Paris Agreement puts Amer-ica alone, not America first, and being alone is tantamount to being last. The expectation among our partners to the Paris Agreement is that the United States will remain engaged, al-though a common refrain among for-eign delegations is that the world is moving ahead regardless. I take that to mean that if U.S. leadership falters, other countries will jump at the oppor-tunity and fill the void we create and receive the gains which should have been ours. U.S. energy policy should support the goals of the Paris Agreement. We have already seen hundreds of American cor-porations make commitments in the agreement’s name. There is infinite po-tential from enhanced U.S. production of scalable and exportable clean energy technology that the world is demand-ing to power our collective future. If we do the opposite and retreat from the global effort to combat climate change, then we can expect to lose out on this economic growth potential because countries like Germany, China, and India will gladly take our place as the world’s leader for clean energy innova-tion and finance. I will do what I can to protect against this loss. It is in our national security inter-ests for the United States to remain actively engaged with the world com-munity to fight climate change. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-pore. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. ERNST ). Without objection, it is so or-dered. Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, in December of 2015, nearly 200 nations gathered in Paris in order to reach an agreement that each country would make a commitment to the reduction of dangerous greenhouse gases that were warming the planet and causing more and more havoc across this entire world. That agreement is something that was hard-won. It took the leadership of the United States because so much of the CO
2that had been sent up into the atmosphere since the dawn of the in-dustrial age was red, white, and blue. It called upon each nation to make a commitment, and they did. The coun-tries making commitments equaled 80 percent of the world’s greenhouse gas emitters. The Trump administration has many advisers telling the President that he should pull out of this Paris Agree-ment, that he should cede leadership to

the Germans, to the Chinese, and to other nations rather than having the United States continue to be the lead-er. That would be very dangerous for our country because we would be ceding leadership in this clean energy revolution to other countries around the planet. There are still many who do not un-derstand the role this clean energy rev-olution is already playing inside our country. In 2016, we deployed nearly 24,000 new megawatts of wind and solar on our planet. To put it another way, in 2005, the total amount of solar en-ergy that was deployed in the United States was 79 megawatts—79. In 2016, we deployed 14,000 megawatts of new solar power. Wind—last year, we deployed another 8,000 megawatts in our country. We are heading toward a point where we have an incredible number of people who are working in these industries. Remem-ber, there are no more than 65 to 75,000 people who are still working as coal miners in the United States. In Massa-chusetts alone, we now have more than 100,000 people who work in the clean energy sector. In wind and solar alone in our country right now, we have 360,000 people who work in those sec-tors. By the year 2020, if we just continue at the pace at which we have been mov-ing over the last several years, there will be 600,000 people working in the wind and solar sector. That is the fu-ture. That is where we should be going. Those are the goals we should be trying to reach. Instead, what President Trump is saying is that the United States is a technological weakling, that the United States cannot do it, that the United States can’t find the capacity to be able to meet this challenge, that we have to give up. The President says he is going to re-vive the coal industry, a 19th century industry, instead of trying to have the United States be the leader in this world on the production of clean en-ergy technologies. Last night, I was at the Kennedy Li-brary, and we were celebrating the 100th birthday of President John F. Kennedy. On that occasion last evening, the library presented to Barack Obama his Profile in Courage Award. Amongst other things that were cited was his commitment to dealing with this challenge of climate change that is affecting our planet and the role that the United States can and should play in the solving of that prob-lem. President Obama promulgated last year a Clean Power Plan. That Clean Power Plan was intended to reduce greenhouse gases in the utilities sector by 32 percent by the year 2030. Presi-dent Trump has already said: We can’t accomplish that. We can’t figure that out. We don’t know how to reduce those greenhouse gases. In 1961, President Kennedy said that we were going to put a man on the Moon in 8 years and return those pilots back to Earth safely. We had to invent new metals. We had to invent new pro-pulsion systems. President Kennedy said that we were not going to do it be-cause it was easy but because it was hard. We were threatened by the Soviet Union for supremacy in outer space. President Kennedy challenged our Na-tion to respond to the threat of the So-viet Union, and we won. Here we are, nearly 60 years later, with another challenge, a challenge that threatens this planet. President Trump says that as a nation we are not up to the challenge. As a nation, we can’t figure out how to solve this prob-lem, even though the solutions are al-ready out there and being deployed across this Nation. Another example of solutions like wind and solar: Elon Musk has a new all-electric vehicle that is going to cost $35,000 and is going to be deployed next year; 400,000 of these vehicles are to be sold. That is a game-changing moment in the history of the automobile, going back to its invention. It is a game changer. To a certain extent, for exist-ing industries, it is a game-over mo-ment unless they get into this all-elec-tric vehicle revolution. What is Elon Musk doing? Elon Musk is creating a Darwinian, paranoia-in-ducing environment within which all of the rest of these automotive companies are now going to have to operate—go electric or perish economically as a company. This is how far it has come: Right now, Tesla has a market value that for all intents and purposes is equal to Ford and to General Motors. That is how much the American people have given in terms of confidence in this company, in this man. We can do it. It should be the Presi-dent of the United States who is saying we can do it. The rest of the world ex-pects us to do it. Why do we continue to import oil into our country from Saudi Arabia? Why do we continue to import oil from other countries around this planet? Why can’t the President set as a goal that we are going to have 100 percent renewables in our country by the year 2050, that we are going to accept it as a national challenge in the same way that President Kennedy accepted the challenge in 1961 to put a man on the Moon, to control, to dominate in outer space? This is a letter to President Trump, which is in today’s New York Times. The full-page ad says: 
Dear President Trump, As some of the largest companies based or operating in the United States, we strongly urge you to keep the United States Paris Agreement on climate change. 
What are the names of these compa-nies? Adobe, Apple, Danfoss, Facebook, Gap, Google, Hewlett Packard Enter-prise, Ingersoll Rand, Intel, Johnson Controls, Mars Incorporated, Micro-soft, Morgan Stanley, National Grid, PG&E Corporation, Salesforce, Schnei-der Electric, Unilever, VF Corporation. This isn’t the President challenging companies in our country to respond to the challenge. These are the companies in America challenging the President to respond to the challenge. It is the Kennedy era on its head; it is like JFK in reverse. He is saying we can’t do it when the private sector is saying we can. Ultimately, this challenge to our competitiveness globally is something that Donald Trump is going to forfeit for our workers. This opportunity to create jobs and markets and growth is going to be something that we lose. We need a President who is going to stand up for this stable, practical framework, which is giving an incen-tive to the private sector to solve this problem. We will be creating jobs while saving all of creation. That is what the winning formula is going to be. This Paris Agreement is going to lead to increased competitiveness in jobs, in economic growth. By remain-ing a party to the Paris Agreement, rather than retreating, we will give Americans the opportunity to harness that can-do spirit and technical know- how to create new businesses and jobs. We will give our Nation the oppor-tunity to be a leader in the global ef-fort to address climate change. We will give America the opportunity to lead in this century and into the next. I urge the United States to remain in the Paris Agreement. We can either be the leader or the laggard internation-ally in developing the new clean energy technologies that will drive our econ-omy and help combat climate change. It is a sad day for our Nation when the President of the United States is challenged by the private sector to step up, especially when he calls himself the CEO President of our country. He is turning his back on these innovative companies that want to be able to cre-ate jobs here in our country in order to save our planet. I pray for the well- being of our planet and that the Presi-dent honors this commitment. I think that the French made a huge statement yesterday in electing their new President, Macron. He was saying to the French people: We must engage the rest of the planet. We must work with the rest of the planet. The Paris Agreement was signed in France in December of 2015. That elec-tion yesterday, I think, should be taken as a signal that we should not be retreating from our global leadership. I urge this administration to adopt an approach that does unleash further this wind and solar and all-electric ve-hicle revolution. With that, I yield back the remainder of my time. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CORNYN.

Madam President, last week our colleagues in the House made a first necessary step to delivering on our promise to repeal and replace ObamaCare and to restore individual choice for a health insurance product that people choose that fits their ac-tual needs, rather than one mandated by Washington, DC. They passed the American Health Care Act, a bill that provides relief to Americans all across the country. With the passage of the AHCA in the House, we have a way for-ward to do away with government mandating one-size-fits-all healthcare. Now that the House has passed this legislation, it is up to the Senate to do our job and to keep our promises. To be specific, the promise President Obama made when the Affordable Care Act was passed—actually, he made many promises multiple times—proved not to be true. So in many ways, when Presi-dent Obama promised that if you like what you have, you can keep it; that if you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor; that if you like your plan, you can keep your plan—none of that was true, we have now learned. I don’t think it is an exaggeration to say that ObamaCare—the Affordable Care Act—was sold under false pre-tenses. So it is up to us to restore indi-vidual choice for healthcare products that people want that fit their needs, not one they buy because the govern-ment is holding a gun to their heads or threatens to penalize them unless they observe the government mandate to buy that healthcare. You know, one of the biggest reasons for passing ObamaCare given at the time, back in 2010, was the number of uninsured in the country. Well, the fact is, there are still 30 million people uninsured under ObamaCare even though it has been the law of the land for the last 7 years. I believe we can and we must do bet-ter to deliver affordable care that peo-ple choose, that meets their individual needs, and not healthcare they buy simply because the government is co-ercing them into doing so. We will work together with all of our col-leagues who are willing to work with us. If that means Republicans are going to be working with 52 Republicans to get this bill passed, we will get it done and we will get it passed. Ideally, though, it would be better if our Demo-cratic colleagues work with us. But so far, they have steadfastly refused to work with us even though they know that ObamaCare is in shambles and that people are finding they can’t find an insurance company where they live because insurance companies are pull-ing out of those individual markets be-cause they are simply losing too much money or people who can buy ObamaCare policies in the individual markets are finding that their pre-miums are going through the roof and that the deductibles are unaffordable, thus effectively leaving them without effective coverage. Even though our Democratic col-leagues know that ObamaCare is melt-ing down and is not serving the public the way they promised it would or, in fact, is a positive harm to them be-cause of unaffordable premiums and deductibles, still, so far they are stand-ing on the sidelines and unwilling to participate in this process. I hope that changes at some point in the near fu-ture in the interests of the people we represent all across the country. 
IMMIGRATION LAW  
Madam President, I want to spend the rest of my time discussing a spe-cific problem that Texans are all too familiar with; that is, people breaking our immigration laws, and not just breaking our immigration laws but then coming into our local commu-nities and committing additional crimes—assault, murder, rape, you name it—in those communities even after they have entered the country il-legally. This is a difficult issue and one that I don’t raise lightly, but it is impor-tant that when we talk about sanc-tuary cities and criminal aliens—these are people who have not just violated the immigration laws, these are people who have doubled down and have no re-spect for our laws, and, frankly, they have no respect for the communities in which they live. They primarily target the minority community in which they live and work. We do need to be clear-eyed about this, and we need to treat it seriously. We need to remember that our inaction has some real-life consequences. I have been glad to see the new administra-tion focus on enforcing the law and re-storing respect for the rule of law gen-erally and taking quick action to help victims of this type of crime in par-ticular. I want to take a couple of minutes to tell a story about one particular victim who was really an American hero, one of my constituents who lost his life at the hands of a violent illegal immi-grant. That would be Houston police officer Rodney Johnson. By all accounts, Rodney Johnson was larger than life, standing about 6 feet 5 inches tall, with a smile just as big. He was a dedicated family man, a husband to fellow Houston Police Department officer Joslyn Johnson. They had three daughters and two sons. His wife even called Rodney ‘‘the glue that held the family together.’’ Rodney was a hero not only to his family but to the local community as well. He was a hero for our country, too, because he was a veteran of the U.S. military police, the U.S. Army. Of course he was a hero for the State of Texas as a former corrections officer with the Texas Department of Public Safety. A few years ago, Rodney ran into the flames of a burning building and saved the lives of several children. For that act of courage, he was awarded one of the highest honors a law enforcement officer in Texas can receive, the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement’s Medal of Valor. Sadly, all of that changed in the fall of 2006. At about 5:30 p.m. on Sep-tember 21, Officer Johnson pulled over a driver for speeding near Houston Hobby Airport. By all accounts, it ap-peared to be a routine traffic stop, but when the driver, Juan Quintero, could not provide Officer Johnson with a driver’s license, he decided to take him into custody. What Officer Johnson did not know is that Mr. Quintero was a hardened criminal illegal immigrant with an extensive record of offenses, as well as deportations and repeated ille-gal entries into the United States. Even more tragically, Officer Johnson did not know that this career thug was concealing a 9mm handgun in the waistband of his clothing. Officer Johnson followed protocol. He handcuffed the criminal suspect, placed him in the back of his squad car, and began writing a police report. But just then, Quintero managed to move his cuffed hands in front of him, reached for his concealed weapon, and opened fire in a cowardly surprise attack, lit-erally killing Rodney Johnson by shooting him in the back. Quintero was a dangerous career criminal who had no respect for our laws. He had no place in our country and had been deported numerous times by the Federal Government. But some-how he was free and on the streets alongside of our families and heroes like Officer Rodney Johnson. That should be an embarrassment to every-one who believes in the rule of law and believes that it is government’s respon-sibility at the local, State, and Federal level to keep our communities safe. This issue is not going to go away, as much as some of our colleagues would like to ignore it. There are countless other stories across the country of vic-tims and their families who have suf-fered from some of the worst tragedies imaginable because of criminal illegal immigrants. I am not talking just about people who have entered the country in viola-tion of our immigration laws; I am talking about hardened criminals who target people in their communities for profit or for other reasons. I have spo-ken about a number of them from the floor before. In addition to Officer Rodney John-son, I could tell you the story of Javier Vega, a Border Patrol officer killed by two criminal illegal immigrants while fishing with his family. These crimi-nals had been deported numerous times and committed multiple crimes. I could tell you about Kevin Will, a Houston police officer killed by a drunk driver who had entered and was living in the United States illegally and who had been deported twice be-fore. I could tell you more about Josh Wilkerson, a teenager brutally killed by a criminal illegal immigrant in 2010,

somebody who had been arrested nu-merous times before. I could tell you about Kara Willingham, who was beaten to death by a criminal illegal immigrant; Gus-tavo Burr or Andres Reyes, kidnapped and held at gunpoint in South Texas; and Neri Garcia, killed by an illegal alien who caused a drunk-driving acci-dent in the Dallas area. I could tell you story after story after story of the tragedies wrought by a Federal policy that did not enforce our borders or make sure that people, once deported, stayed deported because of the danger they posed to our com-munities. I believe this really is a mat-ter of political will, and we finally, for the first time in the last 8 years, have an administration and a President who believe in securing our borders and keeping the public safe. There are larger and other additional discussions we need to have about our flawed immigration system, but the first thing we need to do is regain the public’s confidence by securing our bor-ders and enforcing our laws. I am glad President Trump is well on his way to beginning that process under the lead-ership of GEN John Kelly at the De-partment of Homeland Security. The entire point of this is to keep the first commitment that the government makes to American citizens: that we will protect you and keep you safe. That is the government’s main job, and that includes protecting all Americans and everyone in the country, literally, from those career criminals who com-mit offenses and who thumb their noses at our immigration laws. As I said, the Trump administration is fi-nally taking our security seriously, and I am grateful for that. By focusing on violent repeat offenders, we are pro-tecting our citizens and making our communities safer places to live. I don’t know how anyone could be against that. I look forward to doing my part here in the Senate to continue working with this administration to make sure that our laws are enforced and not ignored, such as the one signed into law by Gov-ernor Abbott in Texas, making sure that sanctuary cities exist no more and that every local, State, and Federal law enforcement agency cooperates in enforcing the law and making our com-munities safe and regaining the public’s confidence in their own gov-ernment. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from West Virginia. Mrs. CAPITO. Madam President, today is a glorious day. It is a great day for this country because we and my colleagues, I believe, will confirm Heather Wilson to be Secretary of the Air Force. There are many reasons why it is ap-propriate for Heather Wilson to be Sec-retary of the Air Force. She has Air Force in her DNA. Her father Doug was an Air Force veteran and commercial pilot. Her grandfather flew for Brit-ain’s Royal Flying Corps in World War I before coming to the United States and serving as a courier pilot during World War II. Heather was to be no different. She was a junior in high school when the Air Force Academy started accepting women. She applied and was appointed there to be part of the Academy’s third class with women. She also became the first woman to command basic training and the first woman vice wing com-mander. After college she thought she was going to flight school, but those plans changed because she answered the call and was awarded the very prestigious Rhodes Scholarship. It was only the sixth year that women were permitted to apply for a Rhodes Scholarship, and she was a collegiate rower there and earned a master’s degree and a doc-torate in international relations. Heather’s assignments and accom-plishments are many. During her serv-ice she was a negotiator and political adviser to the U.S. Air Force in Eng-land and a planning officer for NATO in Belgium, where she worked on arms control negotiations. Heather left the Air Force because she heeded another call to serve as the Director of European Defense Policy and Arms Control on the staff of the National Security Council. I know she worked very closely with former Sec-retary of State Condoleezza Rice dur-ing the Presidency of George H.W. Bush, the fall of the Berlin Wall, and the collapse of the Warsaw Pact. Heather has always been on an up-ward trajectory. She left government and started her own company advising defense and scientific corporations, but public service has always called Heath-er back. In 1995 she was asked to be the cabinet secretary of the New Mexico Children, Youth and Families Depart-ment, where she oversaw foster care, adoption, early childhood education, children’s mental health, and the juve-nile justice system. From there, again, public service kept calling her, and she was elected to the House of Represent-atives in 1998, becoming the first woman to represent New Mexico since the 1940s and the first female veteran elected to a full term in the U.S. Con-gress. I met Heather Wilson in the House of Representatives. Her time on the Hill included service on the U.S. House Committee on Armed Services and the Permanent Select Committee on Intel-ligence. I was lucky enough to serve with Heather, to learn from her and from her incredible depth of knowl-edge, her certainty—Heather is so cer-tain—and her ability to cut through the politics to do what is right for the country. I heard Heather give many speeches on the House floor, and they were always through the frame of what is in the best interests of the United States. So after she left Congress she found-ed another company before she was se-lected as president of the South Da-kota School of Mines and Technology, and she is there now serving as the school’s first female President. My condolences go to the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology be-cause duty is calling Heather Wilson back to Washington to be our Sec-retary of the Air Force. There are a lot of firsts in Heather’s life. Senator Pete Domenici, to whom Heather felt very close, once called Heather ‘‘the most brilliantly qualified House candidate anywhere in the coun-try.’’ I say Heather is a brilliantly quali-fied designee to be Secretary of the Air Force. She has always been not only an incredible intellectual and a strong leader, but she is also a very warm, welcoming, and kind person. We be-came good friends and remain so to this day. She is a leader. She is a spouse. She is a mother of two wonder-ful children, a pilot, and a veteran. So I am excited about the prospect of Heather’s returning to Washington to become our Secretary of the Air Force. Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Presi-dent, Heather Wilson was one of the first women to graduate from the U.S. Air Force Academy and the third gen-eration of her family to serve in the Air Force. She was one of the pioneers of gender integration of the modern Air Force. Even so, her track record in public service and the private sector after her Air Force career raises con-cerns. While serving as the Representative from New Mexico’s First District, Ms. Wilson admitted to telephoning the U.S. Attorney in Albuquerque to pres-sure him on an ongoing corruption in-vestigation of State Democrats, in vio-lation of House ethics rules. Ms. Wilson was paid $450,000 between 2009 and 2013 through a Lockheed Mar-tin subsidiary for consulting work for Sandia National Laboratory. The Gov-ernment Accountability Office criti-cized the lab for not having adequate documentation of the work that she performed, and Lockheed Martin ulti-mately paid $4.7 million to settle charges that it had paid a lobbyist with taxpayer funds. Ethics laws prohibited Ms. Wilson from lobbying within a year of serving in Congress. Ms. Wilson failed to list her business relationship with Sandia Labs in her financial dis-closure filings. In spite of this, she claims that she did nothing wrong. During her unsuccessful run for the Senate, Ms. Wilson claimed that legis-lation intended to reduce bullying of LGBTQ children was a violation of reli-gious freedom. She argued that the cor-rect response was not to punish bullies, but to ‘‘strengthen our children to be more comfortable with themselves.’’ She has steadfastly refused to support Federal nondiscrimination protections for the LGBTQ community. The core values of the Air Force are, integrity first, service before self, and excellence in all we do. In spite of her career as an Air Force officer, Ms. Wil-son has not demonstrated the unflinch-ing commitment to integrity that we

demand of our men and women in uni-form. She has compromised ethics rules in Congress, accepted pay for questionable work that was ill-defined and can’t be fully documented, and failed to show that she is willing to stand up for all serving in uniform, re-gardless of their sexual orientation. For these reasons, I cannot support Ms. Wilson’s nomination to be 24th Secretary of the Air Force. Mrs. CAPITO. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. REED. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. REED. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to use 10 minutes of the Republicans’ allotted time be-cause my side has used all of our time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. REED. Madam President, I rise today to discuss the nomination of Dr. Heather Wilson to be Secretary of the Air Force. The Secretary of the Air Force is an important and influential position within our national security structure. As the head of the military Depart-ment, the Secretary of the Air Force oversees recruiting, organizing, train-ing, and equipping of the force. The next Air Force Secretary will oversee the Defense Department’s most com-plex and costly acquisition programs in history. The Secretary will also lead 495,000 Active-Duty, Guard, and Re-serve members through the challenges of rebuilding long-term sustainable readiness, while contending with ongo-ing operational demands around the globe. Dr. Wilson has the knowledge and ex-pertise to serve in that role. She is a graduate of the U.S. Air Force Acad-emy and a Rhodes scholar. She served in the House of Representatives and on the House Armed Services Committee and the House Permanent Select Com-mittee on Intelligence. Currently, Dr. Wilson is president of the South Da-kota School of Mines and Technology. Without question, Dr. Wilson has no-table credentials, but I have significant concerns about certain of her past ac-tions. First, Heather Wilson & Com-pany, LLC, founded by Dr. Wilson fol-lowing her tenure in Congress, had con-tracts with four National Nuclear Se-curity Administration, or NNSA, lab-oratories—Sandia National Labora-tories, Los Alamos National Labora-tory, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and Nevada National Security Site. From January 2009 through part of 2011, Dr. Wilson’s company received $464,000 in payments from these labora-tories for consulting services. However, due to claims of con-tracting irregularities involving the company, the Department of Energy inspector general conducted two inves-tigations into this matter. As a result, the contractors that operated the lab-oratories on behalf of the government paid back at least $442,877 to the De-partment of Energy with respect to payments made to Dr. Wilson’s com-pany. The rationale for the repayments was the absence of any appreciable evi-dence of work product. Furthermore, Lockheed Martin, which operated Sandia National Laboratories, agreed to an overall settlement of $4.7 million for their management failures. Let me be clear. Dr. Wilson was not found culpable of wrongdoing. Never-theless, the allegations that were lev-ied are serious and directly involved her company. As such, during her con-firmation hearing, I asked Dr. Wilson about these contracts and the allega-tions of impropriety. Unfortunately, I did not receive a satisfactory response. Dr. Wilson deflected any suggestions that she bore any responsibility for these contracting irregularities. As concerning as these allegations are, there was another incident that I found even more problematic as we re-viewed Dr. Wilson’s qualifications to serve as Secretary of the Air Force. In October of 2006, while serving as a Member of the House of Representa-tives, Dr. Wilson contacted a sitting U.S. attorney, David C. Iglesias, who was appointed by President George W. Bush, regarding the status of Federal corruption cases in New Mexico. This action was highly unusual and con-trary to guidance in effect at the time from the House Ethics Committee. In fact, the House Ethics Manual provided that a request for background informa-tion or a status report from a U.S. at-torney ‘‘may in effect be an indirect or subtle effort to influence the sub-stantive outcome of the proceedings.’’ The guidance provided by the manual stated that the best way to commu-nicate any inquiry or question was in writing, in order to make it part of the proceedings. As a former Member of the House myself, I have deep concerns about this action in terms of House ethics rules and the possibility that a Federal pros-ecutor may have felt pressured by Con-gress in an ongoing investigation. In September of 2008, a joint report by the Department of Justice inspector general and the Department of Justice Office of Professional Responsibility, which investigated the removal of nine U.S. attorneys, including Mr. Iglesias, concluded that ‘‘the evidence we have developed so far shows that Wilson . . . in fact called Iglesias before the elec-tion, and that the substance of the call led Iglesias to believe he was being pressured to indict the courthouse case before the upcoming election.’’ During her nomination hearing, Dr. Wilson testified that she called Mr. Iglesias because, in her words, ‘‘an in-dividual or constituent with knowledge of ongoing investigations told me that the U.S. Attorney was intentionally delaying corruption prosecutions, and I felt as though I had to address that al-legation in some appropriate way.’’ However, as I previously mentioned, contacting a U.S. attorney in this man-ner was clearly contrary to the ethics rules that govern the conduct of Mem-bers of the House of Representatives. Perhaps Dr. Wilson, though, does de-serve the benefit of the doubt. Maybe her intention, when she called Mr. Iglesias, was not to pressure him. How-ever, when I asked Dr. Wilson the name of the individual who made the allega-tion about Mr. Iglesias’s intentionally delaying corruption prosecutions, she refused to provide the person’s name. Dr. Wilson argued that she had an obli-gation not to reveal who it was who made a highly politicized and unusual charge against Mr. Iglesias. I think providing the name of the person is important because it helps us to understand the purpose of Dr. Wil-son’s call to Mr. Iglesias. It is one thing if a concerned constituent with no ties or interests in corruption cases under investigation innocuously con-tacted Dr. Wilson. Perhaps her subse-quent call to Mr. Iglesias could be ex-cused. But because we do not have the name, we have no way to verify the motive. It remains very possible that the person who contacted Dr. Wilson wanted to pressure Mr. Iglesias to move forward with these pending cor-ruption cases. If that is the case, it casts Dr. Wilson’s call to Mr. Iglesias in a much different light. Unfortu-nately, without further information from Dr. Wilson, I will not be able to resolve my concerns about this inci-dent. The two issues I have just discussed have reluctantly led me to conclude that while Dr. Wilson has excellent academic and professional qualifica-tions, I must vote against her nomina-tion before the full Senate. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. M

I am pleased that it appears that her nomination will be confirmed today. In the many years I have known Dr. Wilson, I have always been impressed by her intellect and especially by her leadership skills. Her qualifications and character are beyond dispute. Throughout her life, she has used her many talents not for personal gain or self-aggrandizement but for the public good. Dr. Wilson was one of the first female graduates of the Air Force Academy,

which is a pretty impressive accom-plishment unto itself, but she set an even higher standard when she earned a Rhodes scholarship to study at Ox-ford University. Upon being awarded her Ph.D., she went to work for the National Security Council and then ran for Congress. I got to know Dr. Wilson through her in-sightful work on the House Intelligence and Armed Services Committees. Make no mistake—Dr. Wilson made a dif-ference during her service in the House. As a well-respected member of the In-telligence Committee, she built a rep-utation as a no-nonsense legislator who was deeply committed to upholding our national security. In all things, she proved herself to be exceptionally com-petent, and I have to say that she proved herself to be worthy of the high-est trust. After her service in the House, Dr. Wilson became the president of the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology. There, she again set a high bar by leading a school whose alumni, I have been informed, make a higher average starting salary than do Harvard graduates. For over 20 years, our Nation’s Air Force has been involved in conflicts all over the world. Now more than ever, the Air Force needs a proven leader who can modernize the service and lead us to victory. I believe Dr. Wilson will provide that leadership. I have every confidence that she will serve with honor and integrity and make a lasting difference as the next Secretary of the Air Force. I have known her for a long time. I have gone to her State and worked with her and campaigned with her. All I can say is that she is a very top-notch woman leader, one of the best I have seen in all of my time in the U.S. Senate, and I know she is going to do a terrific job. I am going to help her every step of the way, and I am sure everybody else here will. I hope everybody on this floor will vote for Dr. Heather Wilson for this po-sition. We cannot lose. We are all going to be ahead because she is willing to serve and serve more, and she is willing to leave what really is a very com-fortable position in order to take one that is not so comfortable and is very demanding, and I respect her for that and think the world of her. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. M

CCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the nomination of Heather Wilson to be the next Sec-retary of the U.S. Air Force. Dr. Wilson is a proven leader and a dedicated public servant. She is a dis-tinguished graduate of the U.S. Air Force Academy and Oxford University, where she earned master’s and doc-torate degrees as a Rhodes Scholar. If confirmed, Dr. Wilson will be the first Air Force Academy graduate in history to serve as Secretary of the Air Force. Dr. Wilson served 7 years as an Air Force officer. During the Cold War, she served in the United Kingdom and at the U.S. Mission to NATO in Brussels. As the Cold War came to an end, she served on the National Security Coun-cil staff under President George H.W. Bush, working on issues concerning NATO and arms control. Dr. Wilson later moved west to marry her husband, Jay, who is also an Air Force veteran. After a few years in the private sector, Dr. Wilson once again answered the call to service, first as the head of the New Mexico Child Welfare Department and later as a Member of the U.S. House of Rep-resentatives. In Congress, Dr. Wilson was the lead-ing voice on national security. She took on the tough issues, from surveil-lance programs to sexual assault at the Air Force Academy, and she earned the deepest respect of her colleagues on Capitol Hill, including mine. For the last 4 years, Dr. Wilson has been the president of the South Dakota School of Mines, enhancing its reputa-tion as a premier engineering, science, and research institution. Now America’s Air Force needs her leadership. The next Secretary will lead Amer-ica’s Air Force in confronting the most diverse and complex array of global crises since the end of World War II. The world is on fire, and now more than ever our Nation is counting on the global vigilance, global reach, and global power that are the hallmarks of the U.S. Air Force capabilities. The next Secretary will also inherit the oldest, smallest, and least ready Air Force in its history. Twenty-five years of continuous deployments, trou-bled acquisition programs, and fre-quent aircraft divestments have aged and shrunk the Air Force’s inventory. The combination of relentless oper-ational tempo and the self-inflicted wounds of the Budget Control Act and sequestration have depleted readiness. Meanwhile, potential adversaries are rapidly shrinking America’s techno-logical advantage and holding our air-craft at greater risk over greater dis-tances. In short, we have asked a lot of our Air Force over the last 25 years, and the demands placed on the service con-tinue to grow. Congress has only added to the problems with the Budget Con-trol Act and sequestration. We are placing an unnecessary and dangerous burden on the backs of our airmen, and we cannot change course soon enough. We owe our airmen the resources, equipment, and training they need to succeed. We also owe them proven lead-ership. That is why the Senate should confirm Dr. Wilson to be the next Sec-retary of the Air Force. From the Air Force Academy to the Air Force, to the National Security Council, to the House of Representatives, Dr. Wilson has proven herself as a leader. She un-derstands the missions of the Air Force and the capabilities it brings to the de-fense of our Nation. I am confident she will uphold the Air Force’s core values: integrity first, service before self, and excellence in all the Air Force does. Heather Wilson is the right person to lead the Air Force to a stronger future, and I urge my colleagues to support her nomination. Mr. President, I yield back all time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The question is, Will the Senate ad-vise and consent to the Wilson nomina-tion? Mr. M

CONFIRMATION OF HEATHER WILSON  
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I am hon-ored to speak tonight after casting my vote to confirm Dr. Heather Wilson as Secretary of the Air Force. I have known Heather for nearly 20 years and submit that President Trump could not have selected a more qualified can-didate to lead the Air Force in these demanding times. I am pleased that the Senate was finally able to confirm her nomination, and I wish her great suc-cess. As an Air Force veteran, former Member of Congress, and most recently the leader of one of the top science and engineering schools, the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, Dr. Wilson has repeatedly demonstrated leadership abilities that will serve her and the Air Force well in this next chapter. Her commitment to duty links back to her time as a cadet at the Air Force Academy, where she was a distin-guished graduate. In fact, she will be the Academy’s first graduate in history to serve as a Secretary of the Air Force. Dr. Wilson went on to serve as an Air Force officer in Europe during the Cold War, where she was based in the United Kingdom and at the U.S. Mission to NATO in Brussels. Upon leaving the Air Force, she served on the National Security Council staff of President George H.W. Bush, working on NATO and conventional arms con-trol. At a time when America’s partner-ships are being challenged by threats around the world, I am confident that her experience will lend a steady hand to our military decisionmaking. Dr. Wilson will also bring with her great experience honed in the Halls of Congress. At the start of her decades- long representation of New Mexico’s First Congressional District, she quick-ly became one of the go-to Members on national security issues. Heather took on tough issues not unlike the ones she will surely face as Secretary of the Air Force. Whether on issues of strategic objectives and readiness or personnel matters, such as military sexual as-sault, she is prepared to have frank dis-cussions on the issues and will con-tribute insightful proposals on how to best tackle the many challenges facing the Air Force. She understands not only the Air Force’s key capabilities but the perilous outcomes we may face as a nation if we do not properly train and fund our military. She knows that rising to meet the challenges of the day must be done with an eye to the fu-ture so we may also deter and defeat the threats of tomorrow. At a time when national security is of foremost concern, Dr. Wilson under-stands the Air Force’s tremendous re-sponsibility in keeping Americans safe and will be guided by the core values of the Force: integrity first, service be-fore self, and excellence in all that the Air Force does. I could not be happier for my friend, Dr. Heather Wilson, and wish her and her husband Jay the best of luck. South Dakota and the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology are losing an asset, but I am confident that the new era of excellence Heather helped usher in leaves the school well- positioned to remain a foremost engi-neering, science, and research institu-tion. We are proud of Heather’s contin-ued success and trust she will represent us well as the 24th Secretary of the Air Force. I would like to thank my colleague, Chairman M
CCAIN, for his work to ad-vance Dr. Wilson’s nomination through the Senate Armed Services Committee and for granting me the opportunity to introduce Dr. Wilson at her confirma-tion hearing. It was my honor to en-dorse her before the committee and to cast my vote in support of her nomina-tion this evening. I am glad the Senate has advanced another of President Trump’s nominees and wish Dr. Wilson, our next Secretary of the Air Force, continued wisdom and success as she continues her outstanding leadership in service to our country. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-jority leader.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2797 May 8, 2017 
Rockford, the county seat of Winne-bago County, IL. I have had the pleas-ure of knowing and working with him to serve Rockford and Winnebago County for many years. A lifelong resident of Rockford, Mickey Goral grew up on Rockford’s west end graduated from Boyland High School and Northern Illinois Univer-sity with a B.A. in political science. He served on the county board for 18 years before being elected Rockford township supervisor and has held that post for 20 years. At 63 years young, Mickey decided not to seek reelection, but refuses to use the word ‘‘retirement.’’ He said: I hesitate to use the ‘R’ word because I don’t play golf, I don’t fish, and I have no other hobbies.’’ Public service is all that is in Mickey’s blood. Oftentimes, public service becomes about accolades—not for Mickey. He simply aimed to make a difference in people’s lives. Overseeing a $1.6 million general assistance office, Mickey led a nine-person team responsible for pro-viding assistance to the communities most vulnerable: those with no other source of income. His mission was al-ways clear and simple: treat all people with respect, dignity, and compassion in providing basic human needs to fam-ilies while they are on the road to self- sufficiency, and that is what he did. Mickey’s years of service to the people of Rockford show that public service can make a real difference in people’s lives. Following the great recession of 2008, his general assistant office dealt with more than 150 open cases every month. Today, that number in a typ-ical month is cut in half. That is the king of progress Mickey delivered for real working folks in Rockford. Mickey Goral also had the privilege of serving as the president of the Town-ship Officials of Illinois, bringing pro-fessionalism and training for township governments throughout my home State of Illinois, but for all his accom-plishments, Mickey was most proud to the Rockford township supervisor be-cause his government role was one that was closest to the people, which meant he had the opportunity to help his friends and neighbors. We need more people like Mickey Goral. I especially want to thank Mickey’s wife, Tami, and twin daughters, Karley and Kiley, for sharing so much of their husband and father with the commu-nity. I am honored to congratulate him on a job well done and wish him and his family all the best in the next chapter of their lives.

CLIMATE CHANGE Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, the United States is a world leader in inno-vation, science, and technology; pro-moting democratic and humanitarian values; and maintaining international security and economic stability. The United States should play no less of a global leadership role combating cli-mate change. Climate change is the defining issue of our time. It is our greatest environ-mental, political, and moral challenge. History will judge our generation by what we do—or don’t do. I call on this body to pass S. Res. 155, affirming in no uncertain terms the U.S. responsibility to work coopera-tively with the international commu-nity to aggressively and effectively fight climate change. There is no need to debate whether manmade climate change is occurring. The scientific evidence is clear. Green-house gases emitted through human activity are having a profound effect on Earth’s climate, and 2016 was the warmest year on record, beating the record of 2015, which beat 2014’s. The international community is no longer debating the science of climate change, and there should be no further debate in the halls of Congress. Instead we must agree how the United States—as part of the inter-national community—will take all steps necessary to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to preserve our environ-ment and way of life for future genera-tions. We are seeing species extinction and reduction in record numbers. We are seeing our landscapes changing, espe-cially in the American West and in our colder climates like the Arctic. We are seeing extreme weather events dev-astate communities. As a dry, arid State in the South-west, my home State of New Mexico is right in the bull’s eye of climate dis-ruption. New Mexico is the country’s sixth-fastest warming State: the an-nual temperature has increased about 2.7 degree Fahrenheit since 1970. Droughts are becoming more intense. We have decreased snowfall in the win-ter and decreased runoff in the spring. All this has negative consequences for our land and communities. Climate change not only threatens our environment, it threatens our eco-nomic stability and international secu-rity. More than 1,100 U.S. businesses, cor-porations, and organizations, many of which operate internationally, are on record supporting the Paris Agree-ment. The businesses include Arch Coal, BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Dow Chemical, and DuPont. Business leaders agree that the Paris Agreement is good for business. Support for the accord is broad based within private industry, from elec-tricity generators such as PG&E and National Grid, to oil companies such as Exxon Mobil and Shell, to mining com-panies such as Rio Tinto, and to manu-facturers such as General Motors. Even some of the largest coal producers, such as Cloud Peak Energy and Pea-body Energy, support remaining in the agreement. This broad support is due to a simple reality: leaders of success-ful businesses make decisions based on the available science, not ideology. Business leaders are telling Congress and the President to stay in. Last No-vember, over 360 businesses and inves-tors called on U.S.-elected leaders to support the Paris Agreement and other domestic low-carbon policies. The let-ter was signed by more than a dozen Fortune 500 companies, as well as small family-owned businesses across more than 35 states. All these businesses want the U.S. economy to be energy ef-ficient and powered by low-carbon en-ergy. They are concerned that a failure to build a low-carbon economy puts American prosperity at risk. Despite this overwhelming support from the business community, the President has not decided whether the U.S. should continue as a member of the Paris accord. He is undecided de-spite the fact that his Secretary of State, former CEO of the world’s larg-est oil company, says we should stay in, so we have a ‘‘seat at the table.’’ While sufficient resources and atten-tion must be given to carbon-intensive industries and their workforces to en-sure that transitions are not disrup-tive, we must look forward to sup-porting a new energy economy, that addresses climate change and produces good jobs. We should not underestimate the threat climate change poses to na-tional security. Secretary of Defense Mattis does not. He has testified before Congress that climate change poses as a national security threat. Indeed, the Pentagon has considered climate change a national security threat for over a decade. Secretary Mattis wrote to the Senate Armed Services Committee that, ‘‘[c]limate change is impacting sta-bility in areas of the world where our troops are operating today.’’ He ob-served that, ‘‘[c]limate change can be a driver of instability, and the Depart-ment of Defense must pay attention to potential adverse impacts generated by this phenomenon.’’ To prepare for this threat, Secretary Mattis stated that ‘‘. . . climate change is a challenge that requires a broader, whole-of gov-ernment response. If confirmed, I will ensure that the Department of Defense plays its appropriate role within such a response by addressing national secu-rity aspects.’’ According to the American Security Project, climate change serves as an ‘‘accelerant of instability’’or a ‘‘threat multiplier’’ that makes already exist-ing threats worse. ‘‘The threat of glob-al warming for security will manifest through a range of effects: resource scarcity, extreme weather, food scar-city, water insecurity, and sea level rise will all threaten societies around the world. Too many governments are not prepared for these threats, either because they do not have the resources or because they have not planned ahead. How societies and governments respond to the increase in instability will determine whether climate change will lead to war.’’ The President should not disregard the advice of his Secretary of Defense and the established position of the Pen-tagon. The challenge of climate change

requires a broad response from the en-tirety of the Federal Government. The President should meet this challenge head on. Across the globe, people are suffering from the effects of climate change. U.S. businesses and the military feel those threatening impacts as well. U.S. elected officials must listen to these businesses and our Armed Forces. The United States should not only have a seat at the international table, we should be leading the global commu-nity. I urge passage of S. Res. 155, af-firming our commitment to work with the international community to effec-tively address climate change.

PARIS AGREEMENT Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I wish to speak in strong support of the U.N. Paris climate change agreement and in opposition to efforts to under-mine this international agreement that is vital to the environmental and eco-nomic well-being of New Hampshire, the Nation, and the world. In 2015, I joined nine of my Senate colleagues in Paris to attend the 21st U.N. Climate Change Conference, also known as COP 21, where the climate agreement was negotiated. What we witnessed at COP 21 was monumental: 195 countries representing more than 95 percent of global carbon emissions worked together to adopt the first uni-versal climate agreement that calls for international cooperation on address-ing the causes of global warming and helping poorer nations most affected by it. The following year, on Earth Day, the United States and more than 170 nations signed the international climate agreement in New York; and on November 4, 2016, the Paris Accord entered into force. I am proud to say that the U.S. was a big part of that effort. That is why I am so disappointed to see that Presi-dent Trump is currently considering whether to pull the United States from this historic agreement. This would be a huge mistake. No country is insulated from the in-creasingly present and escalating ef-fects of climate change. In the United States, we are seeing it throughout the country, and this is certainly true in New Hampshire. Rising temperatures are shortening our fall foliage season, which is so important to our State’s tourism economy. Milder winters have led to increases of insect-borne dis-eases that endanger our wildlife. In New Hampshire, we have already seen a 40 percent decline in our moose popu-lation. The changing climate is also putting more stress on sugar maples, and this is already affecting syrup pro-duction. The Paris Agreement establishes a long-term, durable global framework for countries to work together to re-duce carbon emissions and keep the global temperature rise well below 2 degrees Celsius in order to avoid some of the worst consequences of climate change. For the first time, countries have committed to putting forward ambitious, nationally determined cli-mate targets and reporting on their progress towards those targets using a standardized process of review. The Paris Agreement encourages trans-parency, accountability, and collabora-tion among nations not only to meet their climate targets, but to encourage innovation while doing so. That is why American business lead-ers are strongly in favor of continued U.S. participation in the Paris accord. From oil giants to tech firms, cor-porate leaders understand that the transition to clean energy presents one of the biggest economic opportunities of this century to create jobs and build wealth in this country. In fact, the International Energy Agency projects that, over the coming decades, more than $60 trillion will be invested in en-ergy efficiency and clean energy tech-nologies as countries address the threat of climate change. The United States stands in a unique position to be the leader of the clean energy revolu-tion. This would be jeopardized if the President decides to remove the United States from the international climate agreement. Climate change represents an enor-mous challenge, but the solutions are within reach if we put into place poli-cies that allow for swift action. The United States must help ensure that the goals of the Paris Agreement are realized. That is why I joined with my colleagues to introduce a resolution stating that the United States should work in cooperation with the inter-national community and continue to exercise global leadership to address the causes and effects of climate change. We have a responsibility to help protect our children and grand-children from the most severe con-sequences of global warming by reduc-ing emissions now. This President must not remove the United States from this important agreement.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
RECOGNIZING FLEWELLING FAMILY FARMS ∑Mr. KING. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Flewelling Farms, who has been designated family farm of the year and McCain’s ‘‘Grower of the Year.’’ Farms and farm families are es-sential assets to my home State of Maine—not just for the tremendous economic benefits the agriculture in-dustry has, but also for the rich herit-age and work ethic that makes up the communities where generations have plowed the lands. Maine agriculture is more diversified than in many States, and on any given day, you can drive past acres of potatoes, grains, large dairy farms, small truck farms, and even smaller value added farms pro-ducing cheese, breads, and maple syrup, as well as conventional farms, organic farms, and even farms raising oysters, seaweed, and salmon. From now until the farm bill is passed, I want to take the opportunity to talk about Maine farms and farmers, their creativity, ingenuity, persever-ance, and ability to grow amazing food and fiber on what can often be hard scrabble land with a solid crop of rocks and trees always watching for the op-portunity to creep back on to land that was cleared long ago by hard work. I want to begin in the agricultural county of Maine, Aroostook County. The potato is king in Aroostook Coun-ty, ME—the large farms and relatively flat fertile land produce 16 million pounds of seed, chip, and table stock potatoes on nearly 50,000 acres, gener-ating thousands of jobs and infuse mil-lions of dollars into the economy of the State of Maine. While agriculture is indeed valuable and essential to tables across the Na-tion and the world, community and farm families are what really makes northern Maine a special place. I am pleased to honor one such family today, the Jerry and Bruce Flewelling family of Easton. The Flewelling fam-ily was named the ‘‘2016 Farm Family of the Year’’ by the Maine Potato Board and the McCain’s ‘‘Champion Grower of 2016’’ as well. These recogni-tions are given for the quality of prod-uct and commitment to the industry, but also for the heart and hardiness of the family who, through trials and tribulations of unpredictable weather and markets, keeps their drive for ex-cellence at the forefront of every day. The Flewellings have been doing this for six generations. The first Flewellings arrived in this country from Wales in the late 1800s, entering the United States near where the fam-ily farm is today. They have experienced tremendous change in how potatoes are grown, har-vested, and stored, but by being ready to implement best practices, new tech-nologies, and innovation, they have grown the farm and its quality and pro-ductivity and are able to carry on the strong tradition of agriculture in Maine. In addition to being an exceptional small business, the family members are active community members as well. They serve on municipal boards, Maine Pesticide Control Board, Agricultural Bargaining Council, as well as Maine Potato Growers. They are a strong voice for future generations of farmers and are mentors to other farmers, as well always encouraging others and sharing their expertise. For these reasons and many more not listed here, I offer my congratulations to Jerry and Bruce and their family on the continuation of an exceptional farm and best wishes as they continue to instill a legacy of hard work and ex-ceptional crops for future generations to come.∑

Dr. Cynthia ‘‘Cyndi’’ Ray and Mr. Sean English. On Sunday, April 2, 2017, Dr. Ray and Mr. English stopped to assist six passengers trapped in an overturned SUV on Interstate 96 near Fullerton, MI, when a second vehicle lost control and struck them. Dr. Ray was on her way to work at Henry Ford Hospital, while Mr. English and his parents were headed to St. Peter and Paul Jesuit Church in downtown Detroit, where he was expected to sing in the choir. The accident left Dr. Ray, Mr. English, and the driver of the second vehicle in crit-ical condition, and, on April 5, 2017, Dr. Ray succumbed to her injuries, trag-ically passing away. Mr. English suf-fered a broken pelvis and lost part of his foot. Dr. Cynthia Ray was born on August 28, 1970, in Kansas City, KS, to parents Floey—Collier—and the late Dr. Fred Ray. Growing up in the State of Okla-homa, Dr. Ray followed her father into the field of medicine. After graduating from Ross University School of Medi-cine in 1999 and completing her resi-dency at St. Joseph Mercy Health Sys-tem, Dr. Ray went on to practice inter-ventional pulmonology at Henry Ford Hospital’s department of pathology and radiology, in Detroit, MI. Highly re-garded as a compassionate colleague and physician, Dr. Ray was part of the Henry Ford family since 2005. Dr. Ray’s talents extended far beyond medicine. As a former Henry Ford Hos-pital ‘‘Campus Idol’’ contestant, Dr. Ray was a gifted singer, as well as a former ballerina and admirable cook. She also cared deeply about rescuing dogs. Dr. Ray will be greatly missed in the city of Detroit, as well as across the State of Michigan. Mr. Sean English, a junior at Univer-sity of Detroit Jesuit High School, is admired by his peers and his teachers. An active member of his school com-munity, Mr. English is a star student- athlete on University of Detroit Jesu-it’s cross country and track team and is the reigning Catholic League cham-pion in the 1-mile run. He is also in-volved in student government and serves on the student senate selection committee. In stopping to assist others in a time of need, Mr. English exempli-fied the mission of University of De-troit Jesuit, ‘‘Men for Others.’’ In a telling testament to his character and the impact he has made, both on his fellow students and the broader Univer-sity of Detroit Jesuit community, there has been an incredible out-pouring of support to both him and his family. I know the administration, fac-ulty, parents, and students of Univer-sity of Detroit Jesuit have offered their praise of Mr. English, for serving as an example of faith and perseverance, as well as his great sense of humor. I ask my colleagues to join me today in recognizing the incredible selfless-ness of these two good Samaritans: Dr. Cynthia Ray and Mr. Sean English. Our communities are made stronger by the actions of everyday heroes, like Dr. Ray and Mr. English. I know that Dr. Ray’s passion, dedication, and compas-sion will be deeply missed. I also com-mend Mr. English for his dedication to helping others, as well as his bravery in the face of adversity, and I wish him a full and speedy recovery. My thoughts and prayers are with every-one impacted by this incident, and I know the actions and sacrifices of both Dr. Ray and Mr. English will continue to inspire others to serve their commu-nity and make a difference in the lives of others.∑

Whereas sexual assault survivors suffer emotional complications long after their physical scars have healed; Whereas advances in deoxyribonucleaic acid (DNA) technology have enabled law en-forcement agencies to identify and prosecute the perpetrators in tens of thousands of un-solved sexual assault cases; Whereas incarceration of sexual assault perpetrators can prevent perpetrators from committing additional crimes; Whereas national, State, territorial, and tribal coalitions, community-based rape cri-sis centers, and other organizations across the United States are committed to— (1) increasing public awareness of sexual violence and the prevalence of sexual vio-lence; and (2) eliminating sexual violence through prevention and education; Whereas important partnerships have been formed among criminal and juvenile justice agencies, health professionals, public health workers, educators, first responders, and vic-tim service providers; Whereas thousands of volunteers and staff at rape crisis centers, State coalitions against sexual assault, and nonprofit organi-zations across the United States play an im-portant role in making crisis hotlines and other services available to survivors of sex-ual assault; Whereas free, confidential help is available to all victims and survivors of sexual assault through— (1) the National Sexual Assault Hotline (800-656-HOPE and online.rainn.org); and (2) more than 1,000 sexual assault service providers across the United States; Whereas the DoD Safe Helpline, Safe HelpRoom, and Safe Helpline mobile app each provide support and help to members of the Department of Defense community— (1) by telephone at 877-995-5247; and (2) online at SafeHelpline.org; Whereas individual and collective efforts reflect the dream of the people of the United States— (1) for individuals and organizations to ac-tively work to prevent all forms of sexual vi-olence; and (2) for no sexual assault victim to be unserved or feel that there is no path to jus-tice; and Whereas April 2017 is recognized as ‘‘Na-tional Sexual Assault Awareness Month’’: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That— (1) it is the sense of the Senate that— (A) National Sexual Assault Awareness Month provides a special opportunity to edu-cate the people of the United States about sexual violence and to encourage the preven-tion of sexual assault, improvement in the treatment of survivors of sexual assault, and the prosecution of perpetrators of sexual as-sault; (B) it is appropriate to properly acknowl-edge survivors of sexual assault and to com-mend the volunteers and professionals who assist those survivors in their efforts to heal; (C) national and community organizations and private sector supporters should be rec-ognized and applauded for their work in pro-moting awareness about sexual assault, pro-viding information and treatment to sur-vivors of sexual assault, and increasing the number of successful prosecutions of per-petrators of sexual assault; and (D) public safety, law enforcement, and health professionals should be recognized and applauded for their hard work and inno-vative strategies to ensure perpetrators of sexual assault are held accountable; and (2) the Senate supports the goals and ideals of National Sexual Assault Awareness Month. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to re-mind my colleagues that April is Na-tional Sexual Assault Awareness Month. We commemorate it each year to bring public awareness to the stag-gering problem of sexual violence. Tens of thousands of people in the United States and hundreds of my fel-low Iowans annually fall victim to this heinous crime. Sexual assault occurs at least every minute and a half, accord-ing to law enforcement statistics. These same figures reveal an increase in rape cases since 2011, contrary to claims by the former Obama adminis-tration that the violent crime rate had declined in recent years. But up to two- thirds of sexual assaults are never re-ported to police, say crime victim ad-vocates. This means that the average perpetrator strikes multiple times be-fore being brought to justice. Equally as troubling, the incarceration rate is less than one percent of all sexual as-saults reported to law enforcement. The FBI ranks rape as one of the two most violent crimes, second only to murder in its effects. Survivors suffer not only physical consequences, but sometimes life-shattering emotional effects as well. According to the Rape Abuse and Incest National Network, as well as the National Alliance to End Sexual Violence, post-traumatic stress disorder is typical. Depression or even suicide is not uncommon. The healing process is often slow and painstaking. Today, I introduced a bipartisan res-olution to commemorate Sexual As-sault Awareness Month and honor the survivors of this heinous crime. I thank Senators F
EINSTEIN and E RNST  for joining me as cosponsors of the res-olution. During my time as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, we have made crime survivors rights a top pri-ority. Two years ago, we passed, and the President signed, major legislation to benefit the survivors of human traf-ficking. Last year, the President also signed the House version of a survivors’ bill of rights that our committee re-ported as part of the Adam Walsh Re-authorization Act and we approved leg-islation to extend programs that sup-port the analysis of sexual assault evi-dence by the Nation’s crime labs. Supporting and protecting survivors of sexual violence will continue to be a focus for our committee in 2017. Last month, I convened a hearing to exam-ine allegations that dozens of young athletes experienced sexual abuse at the hands of coaches, instructors, and others. I recently joined our commit-tee’s ranking member, Senator FEIN-
STEIN , in introducing the Protecting Young Victims from Sexual Abuse Act. The bill’s purpose is to ensure that sex-ual assault allegations by young ath-letes will be reported and investigated promptly. This year we will also make it a priority to extend and update pro-grams that are authorized under the Trafficking Victims Protection Act. Mr. President, I will close by re-affirming my support for survivors of sexual violence and expressing my con-tinued commitment to advocate for them. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting passage of the resolution I have introduced today.

HEALTHCARE LEGISLATION Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, it has been said that nothing is certain but death and taxes. To that, nowadays, we might add bad news about ObamaCare because if there is one thing we can count on, it is bad news about this fa-tally flawed law—high premium costs, huge deductibles, customers losing health plans, customers losing doctors, fewer choices, failed co-ops, unraveling exchanges, and I could go on. There is no question that our healthcare system had problems before ObamaCare was passed. Clearly reforms were needed. But as the past 7 years have made clear, ObamaCare was not the answer, and this law is rapidly col-lapsing under its own weight. Here is a sampling of recent ObamaCare headlines. This is from Bloomberg: ‘‘Thousands of ObamaCare Customers Left Without Options as Insurers Bolt.’’ This is from CNBC: ‘‘Aetna will exit ObamaCare markets in Virginia in 2018, citing expected losses on individual plans this year.’’ From the Arizona Republic: ‘‘Con-sumers seek relief as ‘ObamaCare’ rates rise.’’ From USA TODAY: ‘‘Iowa may be without individual health plans if in-surer pulls out.’’ In February of this year, Mark Bertolini, the CEO of health insurance company Aetna, asserted that ObamaCare is in a death spiral. There is good reason to think he is right in that significant losses are driving health insurers out of the exchanges. Last year, Aetna announced that it would withdraw from 11 of the 15 States in which it offered exchange plans, Humana said it would exit sev-eral exchanges, and mega-insurer UnitedHealthcare announced that it was pulling out of most of the 34 States in which it offered exchange plans. Roughly one-third of U.S. counties have just one choice of health insurer on their exchanges for 2017, and the sit-uation looks likely to get much worse next year. In February, health insurer Humana announced its decision to completely withdraw from the ObamaCare exchanges for 2018. Aetna is pulling out of two of the four States in which it will still offer plans in 2018, and it has indicated it may pull back even further. Wellmark is leaving Iowa. UnitedHealthcare is leaving Vir-ginia. Other insurers are contem-plating similar exits. The New York Times reported in March that ‘‘ObamaCare Choices Could Go from One to Zero in Some Areas.’’ ‘‘Parts of the country,’’ the Times notes, ‘‘are in jeopardy of not having an insurer offering ObamaCare plans next year.’’ The quote goes on: ‘‘Many counties already have just one insurer offering health plans in the ObamaCare marketplaces, and some of those solo insurers are showing signs that they are eyeing the exits.’’ That is from the New York Times. What that means is that tens of thou-sands of Americans may have ObamaCare subsidies next year without insurance plans to spend them on. As my colleague Senator A
LEXANDER , who does so much good work on healthcare as the chairman of the HELP Com-mittee, has said, it is like having a bus ticket in a town with no buses running. While Americans’ health insurance options dwindle, their premiums are rising. Midlevel ObamaCare plans saw an average 25 percent premium in-crease for 2017—a 25-percent increase for just 1 year, which is on top of years of premium increases under ObamaCare. And what are Americans with those plans paying for? The odds are good that they are paying for plans with limited choices of doctors and hospitals. A 2016 study of 18 States and Washington, DC, found that 75 percent of their exchange plans for 2017 would likely be health maintenance organiza-tions or exclusive provider organiza-tions—two types of plans that tend to offer narrow provider networks. In his joint address to Congress at the end of February, the President said of ObamaCare: ‘‘Action is not a choice—it is a necessity.’’ He is exactly right. ObamaCare is collapsing, and the status quo is not sustainable. Unless we want millions of Americans to face healthcare disaster, we have to repeal and replace this law. Last week, the House passed an ObamaCare repeal and replacement bill. This legislation repeals ObamaCare’s tax increases, penalties, and mandates and starts the process of restoring control of healthcare to States and individuals. The House has made a good start, and I am looking forward to getting to build on their bill here in the Senate. I want to make sure we amend the House tax credit to ensure that assistance is better targeted to those who need it the most. I am looking forward to working with my colleagues—Chair-man ALEXANDER , Chairman H ATCH on the Finance Committee, Policy Com-mittee Chairman B
ARRASSO , and many others—to make sure we have a bill that will provide the American people with real relief. ObamaCare was founded on the premise that government knows best when it comes to individuals’ healthcare and that a one-size-fits-all solution is somehow the best solution, but we know now that is not the case. Individuals know best, and their doc-tors know best. Government does not know best. It is absurd to think that a massive Federal bureaucracy can hand down one comprehensive solution that will somehow meet the needs of hun-dreds of millions of individuals in this country. We need to move control from Washington and give it back to the States so they can embrace healthcare innovations and solutions that work for the individuals and the particular needs in their States. Republicans are working to imple-ment the kind of healthcare reform the American people are looking for—more affordable, more personal, more flexi-ble, and less bureaucratic. Americans have had enough of ObamaCare’s prob-lems. They are ready for healthcare re-form that actually works, and we are committed to giving it to them. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

MINISTERIAL OF THE ARCTIC COUNCIL Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak on a couple of important foreign policy issues. I begin by talking about what is going to be happening in Alaska in just a few days. Really, the eyes of the world are going to be on Fairbanks, AK—the Golden Heart City in the mid-dle of Alaska’s interior—for a major foreign policy event. The United States will be hosting the Ministerial of the Arctic Council and will be passing the chairmanship of that Council over to Finland. The Arctic Council is an important foreign policy body. It consists of the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES2816 May 8, 2017 
Arctic countries of the world—the United States, Canada, Denmark, Fin-land, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, and Russia. In just a few days, all of the Foreign Ministers of all of those coun-tries will be in Fairbanks, AK. This is not the first time in recent memory that the Golden Heart City of Fairbanks has been on the world stage in its hosting of a critical foreign pol-icy meeting of world leaders. In fact, almost exactly 33 years ago to this very day in 1984, on May 2, in Fair-banks, AK, Pope John Paul II and President Ronald Reagan met in Fair-banks. It was a great meeting. You could see the chemistry between these two great world leaders. Right now, some historians believe that it was at the Fairbanks meeting of these two great leaders when the Pope and the great President Ronald Reagan laid out their vision and plans to vanquish glob-al communism. America is an Arctic nation because of Alaska, and we have very signifi-cant, strategic interests in the Arctic— economic opportunity, transportation routes, sea routes that are now begin-ning to open because of receding sea ice, responsible natural resource devel-opment—enormous natural resources of all types, including oil and gas—pro-tecting the environment, and respect-ing the culture and way of life of the peoples in the Arctic, particularly of the indigenous peoples, including their subsistence hunting rights. After a sub-stantial discussion I had just a couple of days ago with Secretary of State Tillerson about the upcoming ministe-rial, I am confident this ministerial will focus on these important issues. In going forward, it is important to remember that right now in the Arctic, there are real people with real lives, real families, and real needs who live in this part of the world. They are my constituents. These are the people I represent. They are resilient, tough, hard-working, and very generous. The world is going to see them this week in their hosting of the Ministerial of the Arctic Council in Fairbanks. I thank all of them for their hard work in pre-paring for this event, and I thank Sec-retary Tillerson for rallying all of the world’s Arctic Foreign Ministers to Alaska in the next few days. I will be there to support this very important event. 
f 
U.S.-CHINA RELATIONS Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, in ad-dition to the Ministerial of the Arctic Council, as I mentioned, the eyes of the world are on this—clearly on the im-portant issue of U.S.-China relations. We had the recent President Trump and President Xi meeting in Mar-a- Lago, and this week Madam Fu Ying, who is one of the top Chinese Foreign Minister officials, is going to be in Washington to meet with a number of us. It is something I believe this body needs to focus on more, this important issue of U.S.-China relations. Our country faces a lot of significant national security challenges around the world. In my view, however, the most significant long-term, geostrategic challenge we face is not ISIS, not al-Qaida, not Iran, Russia, or even North Korea. Those are very seri-ous and immediate concerns, but the most significant long-term challenge we face as a country is the rise of China and the threat it poses to the post-World War II international order, led by the United States. This has been made clear in a series of writings by the well-known and re-spected Harvard professor, Graham Al-lison, beginning 2 years ago in 2015. In an article in The Atlantic magazine, he started to write about what he called the Thucydides Trap. Professor Allison is set to publish a book this month on the same topic. In the book, he writes that the defining question of global order for this generation is whether China and the United States can escape the Thucydides Trap. I have had the privilege over the last few weeks to review the book, and I be-lieve it will be a ‘‘must read’’ for those who care about the long-term security and economic interests of the United States. What is he talking about? What is this issue, the Thucydides Trap? Why has Professor Allison been so focused on writing about it and addressing it? Thucydides is the famed Greek histo-rian. Many actually view him as the fa-ther of all history, who wrote an epic historical work about the Peloponnesian War between Athens and Sparta. In that 30-year war, which devastated both of those Greek city states, the rising power, Athens, chal-lenged the established order of the rul-ing power, Sparta. The ‘‘Thucydides Trap’’ is the term Professor Allison describes when he talks about the strategic dilemma and danger that occurs when a rising power threatens a ruling power in the inter-national system. As his new book ex-plores, in the last 500 years when this has happened—because it does happen a lot in history, and he reviews the last 500 years—of the 16 times this has hap-pened in the last 500 years, 12 of those times ended up having extensive war between the two countries. That is not good. Those are not great odds. Indeed, in his Atlantic article just 2 years ago, he concludes by saying that because of the seismic shifts and friction that is occurring between China and the United States, war between these two countries is more likely than is recog-nized at the moment. That is not good news. There is some good news on this be-cause it is not just Harvard professors who are talking about this, such as Professor Allison, who is talking about the Thucydides Trap; so, too, are the Chinese. I, with a number of Senators, had the opportunity a few years ago, when President Xi Jinping visited the Sen-ate, to meet with him. I went down to the Senate floor to talk about some of the issues, some of the ways in which we need to think about the long-term challenges with regard to the United States and China. The article in the Atlantic had just come out, so I talked about it, the Thucydides Trap, and how we need to avoid it. Then I literally walked into a meeting with the Presi-dent of China and some other U.S. Sen-ators. In his opening remarks, he talked about the Thucydides Trap and how China and the United States need to avoid it. So that is the good news. At least on that issue, we are on the same sheet of paper. There is other good news, and that is that this body—the U.S. Senate—in many ways, is the ideal place where we should be discussing, debating, devel-oping, and, yes, implementing the kind of long-term strategic policies we need to address as a country and develop with regard to the rise of China. In ‘‘The Federalist Papers,’’ Madison talks about one of the important roles of the Senate, with its Members having 6-year terms and having significant powers in foreign policy, is to be able to ensure stable and lasting relations between the United States and other nations. Indeed, perhaps more than any other part of the Federal Government, this institution—the U.S. Senate—has the opportunity to act and think and debate and implement policies—stra-tegic policies—for the long-term inter-ests of our Nation. Contrary to some conventional wis-dom, where we only hear about Amer-ican ‘‘short-termism,’’ in terms of long-term foreign policy issues, our country actually has a history of devel-oping long-term strategic frameworks that address significant challenges to America’s security and economic inter-ests. Just think of the Monroe Doc-trine in the 19th century or George Kennan’s strategy of containment in the 20th century, dealing with the threat posed by the rise of the Soviet Union and global communism. These were long-term, successful strategies for the United States in response to significant challenges facing our Na-tion, in part developed here in the U.S. Senate and implemented here, and we can do it with regard to the challenges we are facing now with China. So as we work with the executive branch on developing an American strategy to address the rise of China and to avoid the Thucydides Trap, how should we be thinking about it? What principles should we be focused on? Let me suggest four that we should be fo-cused on as a nation. First, we must recognize and empha-size that the United States is an Asia- Pacific power; second, we must strengthen, deepen, and expand our comprehensive alliances with the Asia- Pacific region; third, we must engage with, not try to contain, China; and fourth—and perhaps most impor-tantly—we must renew America’s strength, particularly the economic power and vitality of this great Nation.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2817 May 8, 2017 
I will turn to each of these principles in a bit more detail. As I mentioned first, America is an Asia-Pacific power, and we must push back on narratives or counterstrategies being developed in the region that talk about Asia for Asians, which are veiled attempts to try to exclude the United States from this dynamic region in the future, in the orders being developed in the Asia- Pacific. Just look at this map. Geographi-cally, we clearly are an Asia-Pacific nation. A few of us, about a month and a half ago, had the opportunity, when Prime Minister Abe was visiting, to have breakfast with him, and I re-minded the Prime Minister at the breakfast that not only are they a key ally of ours in the Asia-Pacific, but for me, as an Alaskan, they are also a neighbor. Just look at this map. I re-minded the Prime Minister that my hometown of Anchorage is actually closer to Tokyo than it is to Wash-ington, DC, and having just gotten off the plane from Anchorage, I can tell you it is a lot closer. When we think of our forces, whether in Alaska or Guam or Hawaii, we look at this map, and on U.S. territory, Alaska forces, based in my great State, are, for the most part, closer to the Ko-rean Peninsula than forces based in Australia. So, clearly, geographically, we are an Asia-Pacific country. Of course, American history has been embedded in the Asia-Pacific for cen-turies. During World War II, the United States led the effort to win the war in the Pacific after the bombing of Pearl Harbor and the bombing of Alaska, which was bombed, invaded, and occu-pied by the forces of Imperial Japan. Many Americans are not familiar with that history of the war. It is not just geographic proximity and the battles we fought to win World War II in the Asia-Pacific, just as im-portant, in terms of our heritage as an Asia-Pacific nation, are the policies we implemented after World War II be-cause it is now clear the United States has underwritten the peace, prosperity, and security of this entire region through our continued military pres-ence, our alliances, and our economic engagement and power in the region. No country has done more than the United States to make the Asia-Pacific the world’s most dynamic and eco-nomically vibrant region, and it has been the policies of our great Nation over 70 years that have led to that. By the way, no country has benefited more from the established order that we put forward and established in this region than China, with the rise of China, in many ways, helped, encouraged, and moved forward by the peace and pros-perity we brought to the region. Let me provide just one example of how the U.S. military forces in the re-gion have played the key role in help-ing keep the relative peace. Our endur-ing naval presence has helped to keep the sealanes, where all of this transpor-tation and commerce and economic growth has occurred, in the Asia-Pa-cific. That has been the U.S. Navy, for decades, doing that. As I mentioned, all nations of the region—ours included— have benefited from this order, and from our policies, and our commitment and our sacrifice. All nations—includ-ing and particularly true, China has. So we must flatly and completely re-ject policies being developed in the re-gion or in Washington that forget our geography and our history. The United States is an Asia-Pacific power. The United States is the preeminent Asia- Pacific power, but many of America’s core national interests are at stake in the region, and we will be an enduring presence in this part of the world for decades and centuries to come. Second, with regard to how to ad-dress the rise of China and the prin-ciples we need to think about, we must continue to strengthen, deepen, and ex-pand our comprehensive set of alli-ances in the Asia-Pacific region that have been built over decades. Now, the United States faces many global chal-lenges, but one of the most critical strategic advantages that we have as a nation, in terms of security, is that we are an ally-rich nation and our adver-saries and potential adversaries and competitors are ally-poor. Just think about it. Look at this map. Look through and think through all of the countries that are either treaty allies of the United States or wanting to get closer, and then think of other coun-tries, including China, Russia, North Korea, Iran—all ally-poor. This is par-ticularly the case in Europe and the Asia-Pacific. As I mentioned, these al-liance systems have been built over decades by Democratic and Republican administrations, and what we need to emphasize now is we should not squan-der them. It is also the case—and we are seeing and hearing about it literally almost every day, whether it is countries like Russia or, yes, China that are con-stantly looking for opportunities to create schisms and tensions between the United States and its longstanding allies. We need to resist that, we need to be aware of that, and we need to focus on our allies. As Winston Church-ill famously said, the only thing worse than going to war with allies is doing so without them. With regard to the Asia-Pacific, we have an opportunity to not just deepen existing alliances with critical countries like Japan and Korea, Australia, New Zealand, Singa-pore, Philippines, and Thailand, we also have a unique opportunity to ex-pand our alliances in the region of the Asia-Pacific with countries like Viet-nam and India. In my first couple of years in the Senate, I have had the opportunity to travel in the region several times—in fact, every time I go home, I travel in the region—and meet with many of the leaders in the Asia-Pacific when they come to Washington or when we are in the region. It is clear to me there is a deep interest in many countries to strengthen their economic and security relationships with the United States. This is driven, in part, by the role we have played over decades as the force in the region that has kept the peace and promoted prosperity, but this is also driven by concerns of almost every country in the region about China’s in-creasingly aggressive actions, particu-larly in the South China Sea, where, despite pledges from senior Chinese leaders not to militarize that part of the world—not to militarize that crit-ical crossroads of commerce for the en-tire world—they clearly are doing it. For a country that in many ways is re-nowned for taking the long view—for having the ability to see around the corners of history—China’s actions are having the effect of driving more and more countries into the American sphere. We should seize this oppor-tunity, while recognizing that the pro-ductive work, the hard work of main-taining our alliances in the region takes time, takes patience, persever-ance, respect, and consistency. To be honest, I was a bit concerned— and I gave some speeches last year about this—that given some of last year’s campaign rhetoric, the Trump administration would not emphasize the importance of our allies and not undertake the hard but necessary work of deepening and expanding key stra-tegic relationships, but I think, to the contrary, they are off to a very good start. The Secretary of Defense, Gen-eral Mattis, in his first trip overseas as the new Secretary of Defense, could have gone anywhere, including NATO, the Middle East, where we have critical strategic interests, but he chose to go to Japan and Korea to cement these critical alliances. The Vice President just got back from a 10-day trip to Japan, to Korea, to Australia, and to Indonesia, with stops in the States rep-resenting the Asia-Pacific, including my home State of Alaska and Hawaii, along the way. I had a good discussion with the Vice President recently over dinner. We talked mostly about this and how fo-cused he and the administration were on maintaining and deepening our alli-ances in the region, but still we can al-ways improve, especially in terms of making sure we are coordinating close-ly with all of our allies on critical deci-sions and that we keep surprises, espe-cially on sensitive strategic issues, to a minimum with regard to our allies. In this regard, President Trump’s recent statement that South Korea would have to pay for the THAAD missile sys-tem that we are deploying in South Korea, after the U.S. had previously stated we would pay, was an unforced error that I hope the administration will be learning from. Of course, this body, the U.S. Senate, also has an important role to play, not only in emphasizing and helping main-tain our alliances by meeting with leaders around the world and working with them but also in bolstering the capabilities of our partners in the re-gion, economically and militarily.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES2818 May 8, 2017 
Right now, there are initiatives that are doing just that, coming out of the Armed Services Committee on which I sit. One is the Asia-Pacific Stability Initiative, led by Senator M
CCAIN, which would do that—increase our ca-pabilities with our partners in the re-gion to deepen our alliances. Our alliances clearly matter. They matter in our long-term strategy to ad-dress the rise of China. But, of course, so does our relationship with China. That is the third principle I would like to discuss. We must continue to engage with China, not seek to contain it, as some have argued. In fact, when we look at the U.S. relationship with China, ever since Secretary of State Kissinger and President Nixon in the early 1970s began having discussions with China’s leadership, America’s policy toward China has always been about engaging. It has never been about containing, as our strategy was with regard to the So-viet Union. Of course, it has taken different forms. We had the One China policy, which we are still focused on, and the Taiwan Relations Act, which was de-veloped by this body in the U.S. Senate in the late 1970s. We had recently initi-ated by President Bush and continued by President Obama the strategic eco-nomic dialogue where senior leaders in the United States and China met every 6 months. I had the opportunity to par-ticipate in that as an Assistant Sec-retary of State under Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. There are all kinds of different ap-proaches to our engagement. In my view, the most strategic concept since the One China policy was the policy de-veloped during the Bush administra-tion by former Deputy Secretary of State Bob Zoellick, who went on to be the president of the World Bank. What he called the responsible stakeholder model was very well-received initially in 2006. He laid it out in a big speech, then went to China and focused on this. Essentially, the essence of that strat-egy was that China has greatly bene-fited from the U.S.-led international order, from the U.S.-led international system; therefore, it is in China’s in-terest to become a responsible stake-holder in that system, to strengthen the international system that has so greatly enabled its own economic suc-cess. In the early days of the strategy, when it was launched, there was a lot of promise. I remember having the op-portunity to go to China with Sec-retary Paulson when he was leading the strategic economic dialogue in the Bush administration. We would meet with all the leadership of China, from the President on down. At that time, every leader in these meetings used the term ‘‘responsible stakeholder.’’ They talked about it; they talked about this American concept as a framework for our relationship. Unfortunately, it doesn’t seem to be working out so well now. Chinese offi-cials no longer talk about being a re-sponsible stakeholder. In fact, on many military and economic issues, they seem focused on undermining the US- led international order. Professor Allison’s book mentions this specifi-cally, where he says an increasingly powerful China is unraveling the Amer-ican-led order, throwing into question the peace that generations in the re-gion have taken for granted. When we look at the long arch of his-tory with regard to China, this notion that maybe they wouldn’t accept this idea of becoming a responsible stake-holder in our system that we created— that might not happen. Indeed, this was foretold by one of the wisest men in Asia, Lee Kuan Yew, who was the fa-ther of Singapore. Decade after decade as he built that country into an eco-nomic powerhouse, American leaders— military leaders, political leaders, Presidents, Democrats, Republicans— would meet with Lee Kuan Yew to get his advice and wisdom. I had the opportunity as a young Na-tional Security Council staffer to be invited to a meeting with Lee Kuan Yew when I was in Singapore—one of the most interesting meetings of my career—with Deputy Secretary Bob Zoellick and our Ambassador. Lee Kuan Yew talked about Asia and about America’s role for 2 hours. But in another book about Lee Kuan Yew by Professor Allison, he was asked about whether China would accept this idea of being a responsible stakeholder in the American-led international order. His answer was: Of course not. Why not? How could they aspire not to be No. 1 in Asia and in time No. 1 in the world? When asked about this concept of being a responsible stakeholder in this system which has benefited them, Lee Kuan Yew was complimentary of the concept that the Americans were try-ing to lay out, but he said: China wants to be China and, as such, not an hon-orary member of the West and their international system. So even though it is clear that the responsible stakeholder framework is not working with China, we still need to stay engaged at all levels—senior leaders, economic officials, military leaders. I want to compliment the President on how he started the rela-tionship with President Xi Jinping. They seem to be off to a good start. At the same time, we need to con-tinue to look at different concepts, dif-ferent frameworks of how we continue to engage with China. Let me suggest one idea that I have termed ‘‘true reci-procity.’’ As China has rejected the responsible stakeholder model, it is also clear they are increasingly rejecting the idea of a reciprocal relationship with the United States across a number of sectors. Let me give a couple examples. We look at issues like intellectual property theft. The United States has been raising this issue for decades. As a matter of fact, I had the opportunity to sit in a meeting with former President Bush, Condoleezza Rice, and senior Chi-nese officials in the Oval Office. We talked about this issue. The President pounded the table on this issue. The Chinese committed not to steal our in-tellectual property. Yet that continues unabated, now often through cyber at-tacks. We look at foreign direct investment, how Chinese companies invest in Eu-rope and the United States, how they are buying companies such as advanced robotics, biotech, media, high-tech companies, internet companies. But if an American company or a Western European company wanted to do the same in China, we know what the an-swer would be. It would be no. This lack of economic reciprocity ex-tends beyond the trading relationship. I attended a briefing a few weeks ago in the Senate by the Asia Society, which is putting out an important strategy document with regard to China—ideas for the Trump administration, a very thoughtful policy recommendation piece. One thing they noted in terms of di-plomacy: Right now in Beijing, our U.S. Ambassador is typically getting only deputy minister-level access, dep-uty minister-level meetings, while back here we give much higher access to ministers to the Secretary of State. This was essentially confirmed by former President Obama’s own Ambas-sador, former Senator Max Baucus, who, in a remarkable exit interview about his time as Ambassador to China—a job he loved—talked about how, in many ways, in terms of reci-procity, we were too weak, not firm enough, pushed around. These are his quotes. It was an interview that actu-ally didn’t make a lot of news but was quite remarkable—how we had no strategy to deal with this, how we needed to draw our own redlines. As we develop a long-term strategy toward China to avoid the Thucydides Trap, we need to institute an engage-ment policy which looks at true reci-procity. I will be speaking about this more in the coming weeks, and I am going to be offering legislation with re-gard to reciprocity in the economic and trade relationship. But I will say, dip-lomatically speaking, this should be a no-brainer. If our Ambassador in Bei-jing gets only deputy minister-level ac-cess to Chinese officials in China’s cap-ital, then that is what we should pro-vide China’s Ambassador here. It is simple, easy. The final principle we need to focus on in developing our long-term strat-egy to address the rise of China is the imperative to renew America’s strength, particularly the economic power and vitality of the United States. We have to be strong at home again, and we haven’t been. I have a chart here that says it all. Over the last, really, 10 to 15 years, we have a lost decade of economic growth. We have not been able to hit 3 percent GDP growth in almost 15 years. Some

have called this the new normal; this is what we should expect. But in many ways, when we look at this chart—Re-publican, Democratic administra-tions—the 3-percent line here is not a great number. It is an OK number. The traditional numbers of economic growth are closer to 4 percent for our country. But literally, in almost 15 years, we haven’t hit it—not once. President Obama was the first Presi-dent who never hit 3 percent GDP growth in a year, ever. This is not a healthy economy, and in many ways people are starting to question the American dream, the idea that each generation will be better. We have to get back to a strong economy. I certainly hope the Trump administra-tion will be focusing on this. I know that many Members of this body are fo-cused on this issue. Last quarter we didn’t have a good start with the new administration—0.7 percent GDP growth, less than 1 per-cent growth. Economic growth, even more than military might, in many ways is the coin of the realm in Asia. We must get back to a robust economy. Many experts at home and abroad say we can’t do it. They say our demo-graphic challenges are too great, but I disagree. If we look at U.S. history, every time we are dismissed, every time someone talks about the decline of the great American engine of growth, whether in the 1930s or in the 1970s or beginning in the 1980s when Japan was going to overtake us—every time that has happened and the naysayers are out there, the U.S. econ-omy comes roaring back. It is critical that we do this now. We have so many strategic advan-tages, even relative to China, with re-gard to our economy. So many of our challenges, in my view, are self-in-flicted problems that we can solve. Strong economic growth—at least about 3 percent—will more closely bind our allies to the United States in the Asia-Pacific region. Strong economic growth will help us rebuild our military, which has been drastically cut over the last 8 years. Strong economic growth will be crit-ical to tackling our challenges at home, such as skyrocketing deficits and debt levels and crumbling infra-structure. Perhaps, most importantly, strong economic growth will enable us to view the future, including the rise of China, with confidence and not fear. Our great Nation succeeds when we look to the future with opportunity, not with trepidation. In Professor Allison’s upcoming book, currently ti-tled ‘‘Destined for War: Can America and China Escape Thucydides’s Trap,’’ he notes that fear was the driving force that propelled Athens and Sparta into the Peloponnesian War. ‘‘What made war inevitable,’’ Thucydides tells us, was the rise of Athens and the fear this instilled in Sparta. In the 12 of 16 cases he reviews in his book where a rising power challenged an established power leading to war, fear was a key driving force that often precipitated war. The more our policies at home can renew America’s strength, vitality, and confidence, the more like-ly in my view it is that we will develop clear, long-term foreign policies that can help us avoid the Thucydides Trap. I have had the opportunity in my ca-reer to view the U.S.-China relation-ship over the past two decades from a variety of different lenses and perspec-tives. Over 20 years ago, I was deployed as a young marine infantry officer as part of an amphibious task force to what later became known as the Third Taiwan Strait Crisis, defending U.S. in-terests in the region and those of our ally Taiwan. Later, I was an NSC staffer and an Assistant Secretary of State under Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, and I spent a lot of time in China work-ing on these issues. I became a State of Alaska official, traveling for my State as the commissioner of natural re-sources and energy. I have traveled to China to pursue the promise of better economic relations. China is now the No. 1 market for my very export-ori-ented State, for Alaska exports. Now, as a U.S. Senator, I am focused on this issue and cochairing the U.S.-China working group with my good friend Senator D
AINES and getting out to the region as often as possible. I have seen the promise, opportunity, and challenges of the U.S.-China rela-tionship as it has matured over the last 20 years, and I have deep respect for China, its history, and all that it has recently accomplished. I know some of the leaders there and consider them colleagues. This body, the Senate, and our coun-try need to do more to focus on how to make sure that the rise of China is compatible with U.S. economic and na-tional security interests and, most im-portantly, with the interests of the people we represent. I have laid out some core principles this evening on how we might begin to develop a coherent, long-term strategy and address the challenges and oppor-tunities of China’s rise. I hope my col-leagues—Democrats and Republicans— will work together over the years on this incredibly important issue. There is so much at stake and a lot of work to do by many in the governments, the private sector, and the military—both in the United States and in China and in the countries of the region. The gravitational pull of history might be working against us. There is a lot riding on how we address this pre-eminent geostrategic issue. Let me conclude by reading how Pro-fessor Allison, in his book, sums up the challenge. He states: 
The return to prominence of a 5,000-year- old civilization with 1.4 billion people is not a problem to be fixed. It is a condition—a chronic condition that will have to be man-aged over a generation. Success will require not just a new slogan, more frequent presi-dential summits, or additional meetings of departmental working groups. Managing this relationship without war will demand sus-tained attention, week by week, at the high-est levels in both governments. It will re-quire a depth of mutual understanding not seen since the Henry Kissinger-Zhou Enlai conversations that reestablished US-China relations in the 1970s. Most significant, it will mean more radical changes in attitudes and actions by leaders and the public alike than anyone yet has undertaken. To escape Thucydides’s Trap, we must be willing to think the unthinkable—and imagine the un-imaginable. Avoiding Thucydides’s Trap in this case will require nothing less than bend-ing the arc of history. I yield the floor.

SPEECH OF  
HON. JACKIE SPEIER 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, May 2, 2017 Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, first and fore-most, I want to thank my colleagues, Rep. L
OISFRANKEL , Rep. B RENDA LAWRENCE , Rep. B
ARBARA LEE, Rep. A NNKUSTER , Rep. N ORMA  T
ORRES , Rep. S HEILA JACKSON LEE, Rep. D ON B
ACON , and Rep. M ARTHA MCSALLY, who spoke out during the May 2nd Special Order Hour on nonconsensual pornography in the military. It is critical that we continue to raise awareness about this topic and I am grateful to see Members from both parties coming to-gether to fight this predatory and humiliating practice taking place in our military. I would also like to specifically thank Reps. F
RANKEL  and L
AWRENCE for hosting the Special Order Hour on behalf of the Democratic Women’s Working Group. I am deeply passionate about stopping non-consensual pornography in the armed serv-ices, and was disappointed to miss the Spe-cial Order Hour. I had an unavoidable conflict, since at the same time I was serving as the Ranking Member of the House Armed Serv-ices Committee Military Personnel Hearing on the Annual Report on Sexual Harassment and Violence at the Military Service Academies. During the hearing, I listened to brave testi-mony from military survivors of sexual assault and harassment who also suffered retaliation after they came forward. All members of the military deserve protection from sexual vio-lence on the internet, in the academies, and every place else. Marines United, and other incidents of non-consensual pornography in the military, are examples of degrading behaviors that destroy careers and lives. When these horrific incidents occur, it is not about sex or social media policy; it is evidence of a culture of rot that is allowed to spread by military leadership. I am concerned that NCIS and military lead-ership is not taking this seriously—my staff found scores of nonconsensual pornography images on Tumblr in under 5 minutes with the search term ‘‘Tumblr Army naked.’’ These at-tacks go well beyond just the posting of the pictures. They are widespread and involve every branch of the military and all levels of command, as shown by the charge against Master Sgt. Theophilus Thomas. Why is it that other crimes are punished with a zero tolerance policy and the individual is removed from service, while stalking, har-assment, and the destruction of your col-league’s career fails to warrant the same pun-ishment from the military? These crimes pose a serious threat to troop readiness and morale and must be treated as such. I am proud to be a co-lead with Congress-woman M
CSALLY on the PRIVATE Act, which would make posting consensually taken, but nonconsensually distributed intimate photos il-legal under the UCMJ. I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will join together and support the PRIVATE Act and the brave men and women who put their lives on the line in service to our country. f 
AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT OF 2017 
SPEECH OF  
HON. JIMMY PANETTA 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 4, 2017 Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to the American Health Care Act. My colleagues across the aisle tried and failed once before to consider this bill, but they pulled it from the House floor because they didn’t have the votes. Today, they seek to pass this. amended bill, but it’s just as flawed as the first. The changes will hurt seniors, veterans, the sick, and middle and low-income individuals. Essential health benefits guaranteed in the Af-fordable Care Act can now be waived, com-prising quality health care for those with pre- existing conditions, expectant mothers, and in-dividuals seeking mental health and substance abuse treatment. Ultimately, millions of Ameri-cans will be harmed by this bill. This second attempt to rush a vote on our nation’s health care, without a revised Con-gressional Budget Office score, was quickly and carelessly crafted to meet arbitrary, dead-lines and ill-conceived campaign promises. Protecting the central coast of California’s health care, particularly for the most vulner-able among us, is one of my top priorities. I urge my colleagues in the Majority party to focus not on partisan interests but serve the people. I will be voting no on this bill. I urge my colleagues across the aisle to do the same.

IN RECOGNITION OF ST. ROSE- M
CCARTHY CATHOLIC SCHOOL 
HON. DAVID G. VALADAO 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, May 8, 2017 Mr. VALADAO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate my alma mater, St. Rose-McCar-thy Catholic School on its 100th anniversary. In 1911, the school’s founder, Father Philip Scher, became pastor of St. Brigid Church, with hopes of eventually expanding to build a hospital and a Catholic parochial school near the church. The hospital was established two years later in 1913 and was staffed by Domini-can Sisters of Kenosha. Four years later, on August 31, 1917, St. Rose Catholic School, named after St. Rose of Lima, the first Amer-ican Dominican saint, was established and was staffed by three teaching sisters. The first location of the school was in a Holy Names Society hall behind the church. The school consisted of three classrooms, sepa-rated by folding partitions where seventy-five eager students came to learn. By 1919, the teaching staff increased to five sisters and a porch was enclosed to create more class-rooms and a garage was used as a kinder-garten. In 1921, Father Peter H. McNellis im-proved the school aesthetically, added two more class rooms, and added a kitchen. En-rollment then doubled and in the following years more improvements were made to the school. In 1941, Thomas McCarthy, a parishioner, donated a generous gift to the parish in his will with the purpose of constructing a new pa-rochial school. The new school was con-structed and renamed Thomas McCarthy School in his honor. Enrollment continued to increase to 450 students, leaving the teaching sisters with their hands full. In 1997 the school was renamed from Thomas McCarthy School to a combination of its former name and its current name to create St. Rose-McCarthy Catholic School. Currently, there are 135 students in grades preschool through 8th grade. The school remains an ex-cellent educational institution in the Central Valley; it was built by, and continues to be successful due to, faithful volunteers, gen-erous donors, and the Dominican Sisters of Kenosha. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the United States House of Representatives to join me in congratulating St. Rose-McCarthy Catholic School on their 100th anniversary, and wish them continued success for many years to come. f 
HONORING MAJOR EFRAIN REYNA, JR.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, May 8, 2017 Mr. CARTER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Major Efrain Reyna Jr. of the United States Army for his extraordinary dedi-cation to duty and service to the Nation. After four years of faithful service in the nation’s capital, Major Reyna will transition from his present assignment as a Budget Liaison at Department of the Army Headquarters to civil-ian life back in the Great State of Texas. Major Reyna has demonstrated the invalu-able service that Army Congressional Liaisons provide Congress. He enabled countless Members and staff in developing a better un-derstanding of Army policies, operations, and requirements. His first-hand knowledge of mili-tary needs, culture, and tradition were of tre-mendous benefit to Congressional offices. Prior to service as a Liaison, Major Reyna was assigned to my office as a Military Fellow

where he quickly became an indispensable asset to my team. His performance was su-perb and he earned my utmost respect. His ability to build relationships and create oppor-tunities aided me greatly in securing legislative language in support of the 2009 Fort Hood shooting victims, an effort that had been a pri-ority of mine for 5 years. A native Texan from the Rio Grande Valley, Major Reyna is a distinguished military grad-uate from Saint Mary’s University where he earned a commission in the Army Aviation branch. He served with the 101st Airborne Di-vision as a Chinook helicopter pilot and pla-toon leader. From here, he deployed on his first combat tour to Afghanistan as a flight pla-toon leader in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. Efrain also served with the 1st Cav-alry Division at Fort Hood, Texas, ‘‘the Great Place.’’ While there, he served in various lead-ership positions to include Chinook company commander and support battalion operations officer. Efrain conducted his second combat deployed to Afghanistan with the 1st Air Cav-alry Brigade as a company commander. His dedication to excellence has not gone unnoticed.

RECOGNIZING JESSICA NALEPA 
HON. MICHAEL T. McCAUL 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, May 8, 2017 Mr. M
CCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Jessica Nalepa, an outstanding member of my staff who is transitioning out of my office after seven years to share her tal-ents with the administration. A Virginia native, Jessi interned in my office while she was in school at George Mason Uni-versity where she earned her Bachelor of Arts in Government & International Politics and Communications, graduating cum Laude. De-spite her East Coast upbringing, Jessi soon became an honorary Texan through and through. Her outstanding work as an intern swiftly led her to become a permanent part of my team as the Director of Scheduling. Continuing to demonstrate her talents and work ethic, she moved through the ranks of my office fast: first from Scheduler to Deputy Chief of Staff and then ending her service to me as my Chief of Staff Jessi has been an integral part of my team and has served dutifully as a public servant to Texas–10 and the entire state. She also played an instrumental role in my personal growth here in Congress when she helped me in my campaign to become Chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee during the 113th Congress. Possibly the toughest part of Jessi’s job was balancing my duties to serve Texans through my personal office and simultaneously ensure the safety of all Americans through my work on the committee. Despite the challenges this posed on a daily basis, Jessi always went above and beyond. She managed these dy-namics with professionalism, integrity, and a high degree of respect for the people who we serve. And, I’ll add she accomplished all of this while earning a Master’s Degree in Public Policy Analysis from George Mason Univer-sity. Jessi’s dedication to Texas’ 10th Congres-sional District and the U.S. House of Rep-resentatives is an extraordinary example of her strong commitment to her country and fel-low citizens. Even though she is departing my office, Jessi will always be part of Team McCaul and I will be forever grateful for her work. Jessi is possibly the hardest worker I have had the honor to know, and she will be sorely missed by all. Mr. Speaker, I invite my colleagues to join me in thanking Jessi for her service to the great state of Texas and our nation, and wish her the very best of luck as she sets forth on the next chapter of her life. f 
HONORING MR. TED HALL 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, May 8, 2017 Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mr. Ted Hall, who is being honored as the 2017 Napa Valley Grow-er of the Year at the Napa Valley Grapegrowers’ 42nd annual dinner. Mr. Hall has a long and successful history of management and leadership within the wine industry in California and throughout the na-tion. A native of Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania, Mr. Hall received his undergraduate degree from Princeton University and went on to earn his MBA from Stanford University. Before coming to Napa Valley, Mr. Hall de-veloped his true love of the land while living on his family’s farm in the township of Potter, Pennsylvania. He served in the U.S. Marine Corps and is an active jazz trombonist and piano player. Mr. Hall exemplifies the values of the Napa Valley Grapegrowers. He is dedicated, shows good judgement, and pays attention to the de-tails that matter. He has served as President & CEO of Long Meadow Ranch since 1989. Additionally, Mr. Hall serves on the board of directors for numerous educational, charitable, and arts organizations. Drawing on his knowl-edge and success in the vineyard industry, Mr. Hall represents and advocates on behalf of growers as Chairman of the Napa Valley Grapegrowers and as a member of the Indus-try Issues Committee. As someone who shares his great commu-nity pride for Napa Valley, Mr. Hall looks to the region’s future by sharing his expertise with the next generation of growers and farm-ers. He is the current Chairman of the St. Hel-ena High School Agriculture Education Com-mittee and the Napa County Agriculture Pro-tection Advisory Committee (APAC). Mr. Hall supports multiple conservation easements in Napa County and is a member of a variety of public and private organizations involved in food and agriculture. Mr. Speaker, Ted Hall has had a remark-able career as a business leader in our Napa Valley community. Therefore, it is fitting and proper that we honor him here today. f 
PROVIDING RELIEF FROM THE FAILED OBAMACARE EXPERIMENT 
HON. BRIAN BABIN 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, May 8, 2017 Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I promised the people of the Thirty-Sixth District of Texas that I would repeal Obamacare and replace it with conservative solutions. President Donald J. Trump was elected on this same platform. Last week we came together to fulfill that promise. After years of speeches, debates, elections and ‘‘show votes’’ that we knew would be ve-toed or go nowhere in the Senate, last week’s vote was the real deal. This was perhaps the most important and consequential domestic policy legislation any of us will ever see. To begin with, it serves as the largest enti-tlement reform of the Medicaid program in the program’s history and eliminates the individual and employer mandate penalties. It also stops mandatory spending on large abortion busi-nesses, such as Planned Parenthood, for one year. It isn’t the exact bill I would have written, but I am proud to say that I voted YES on the AHCA. While Republicans alone provided the votes to pass this bill, it was still the product of finding common ground to provide the American people with relief from Obamacare. Members of our conference from every ide-ological stripe and every type of district came together to improve the bill and to secure its passage. While we could certainly write a better one that allows for insurance sales across state lines, gives consumers better choices about the plans and benefits they want, and tears down the anti-trust exemption for insurers— the absurd tightrope we must walk to comply with the Senate’s reconciliation rules has forced us to write this bill with one hand tied behind our back. Like their colleagues here, Senate Demo-crats have made clear that preserving the failed experiment of Obamacare matters more than anything else, and that they would launch a fake, phony Filibuster if anything came to the Senate that did not comply with the Sen-ate procedure known as the ‘‘Byrd Rule.’’ I was extremely pleased to be part of House passage of AHCA last week and now look to the Senate to move the road blocks that con-tinue to threaten our conservative agenda.

IN HONOR OF PATRICK LEONARD 
HON. ROD BLUM 
OF IOWA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, May 8, 2017 Mr. BLUM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mr. Patrick Leonard of Dubuque, Iowa for his year of service as President of the Iowa Funeral Directors Association. A fellow graduate of my own alma mater, Loras College, Mr. Leonard has successfully owned and operated his funeral home in Du-buque since 1990. His year as President of the Association has been marked by faithful leadership of the IFDA Board of Governors as they pursued IFDA’s mission of promoting and supporting funeral service excellence. Since coming to Congress in 2014, I have seen firsthand the dedication, enthusiasm, and passion that Mr. Leonard brings to his profes-sion every day. Last summer, we were hon-ored to have Mr. Leonard represent the IFDA at my congressional office’s Dubuque Senior Wellness Fair. He understands that leadership is about stepping up and getting involved per-sonally in service of the mission. Mr. Leonard also finds time to give back to his community. Just last year, after months of preparation and coordination with the U.S. Navy, Mr. Leonard oversaw the return of a WWII veteran’s remains back to Iowa. Mr. Leonard expressed to me how much of an honor this was for him, and how this project signified the importance of funeral services to those who pass, and their loved ones. On behalf of the nearly 700 licensed funeral directors in Iowa, I want to again thank and recognize Mr. Leonard for his exemplary serv-ice as President of the IFDA.

HONORING THE TREFETHEN FAMILY 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, May 8, 2017 Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Trefethen family, John, Janet, Lorenzo, Hailey and, post-humously, Eugene and Catherine, for their hard work, dogged perseverance and commu-nity involvement. The Trefethen family first restored their his-toric McIntyre Winery, which is on the National Register for Historic Places, in 1973. In Au-gust of 2014 the largest earthquake in the Bay Area since 1989 caused significant damage to the winery. Rather than scrapping their winemaking operations and moving elsewhere, they stayed and rebuilt the winery and will hold a celebratory re-opening this week. Led largely by Hailey, the McIntyre building has been resurrected and now includes a new base that is earthquake resistant. The McIn-tyre building today contains 85 percent of the original building material and will use the same 19th century pipes to distill the famous Trefthen family wine. When Gene moved to the Napa Valley 50 years ago, the Trefethen family began a long tradition of community involvement. The family donates wine to many community events an-nually to be auctioned for charitable causes in-cluding children at risk and the environment, two of the family’s passions. The Wine Community is integral to our way of life in my district. The Trefethen family has done more than their part to support our com-munity. John was the founding President of the Napa Valley Grapegrowers and has served multiple terms on the Napa Valley Vinters Board. Janet served on the Board of Directors for the Queen of the Valley Founda-tion and founded the Oak Knoll District of Napa Valley, where she lead the effort to have it recognized as an American Viticulture Area in 2004. Hailey recently finished serving terms on the Board of California Institute and the Napa Valley Vintners. Mr. Speaker, on May 7, the Trefethen’s will host their winery’s grand re-opening. True to their love of community, it will feature local high school choirs, vocalists and a barbershop quartet. They have worked hard to preserve their winery. It is fitting and proper that we honor them here today. f
