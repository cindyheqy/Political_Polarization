PRAYER Rabbi Arnold E. Resnicoff, Retired Chaplain, United States Navy, Wash-ington, D.C., offered the following prayer: O Lord who said ‘‘Let there be light,’’ we have reason still to fear the dark, the dark of senseless death, of murder, terror, fear, and strife, testing faith in a future warm and bright. This day, 18 July, almost 250 years ago, the Gazette in Boston published a patriotic hymn, ‘‘The Liberty Song’’: 
Join hand in hand, brave Americans all; By uniting, we stand; by dividing, we fall. 
I was in a Beirut foxhole, 1983, reli-gious war, but U.S. foxholes were unique: interfaith. Side by side, some sought you through different religious faith traditions; others—not religious— found faith and common cause in free-dom’s call, in freedom’s holy light. Help us, we pray, learn the truth. I learned that day that if more fox-holes, if more people made room for others’ faiths, we would need far fewer foxholes and have more cause for faith. So give us strength to pray. Join hand in hand, brave Americans all. By uniting, we stand; by dividing, we fall. Amen. f 
THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-ant to section 8(a) of House Resolution 820, the Journal of the last day’s pro-ceedings is approved.

PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair will lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. The SPEAKER pro tempore led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Repub-lic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f

NATIONAL SEA GRANT COLLEGE PROGRAM AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2015 
SPEECH OF  
HON. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN 
OF MARYLAND  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, July 14, 2016 Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in re-luctant opposition to S. 764. Although I sup-port a uniform national set of standards relat-ing to GMOs and food labels, I do not believe that this legislation adequately balances the competing interests at stake. On the one hand, most scientists agree that GMO seeds and foods are safe for consump-tion. At the same time, a majority of Ameri-cans have consistently stated that they want to know if their food contains GMOs. Sup-porters of more comprehensive food labeling have argued that this bill contains large loop-holes that would keep many consumers in the dark. Unfortunately, not a single hearing was held on this bill to listen to the competing per-spectives and recommendations. I am also disappointed that on such a controversial and important subject, members were not given the opportunity to offer any amendments. I am concerned that a hastily written and passed federal bill will now preempt state laws that seek to provide their consumers with more comprehensive and readily accessible information. While I do not believe that an in-consistent patchwork of individual state regula-tions is the long term answer, I do believe we could improve on the provisions of this bill.

HONORING THE MARIN COUNTY FAIR 
HON. JARED HUFFMAN 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, July 18, 2016 Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Marin County Fair in honor of its 75th anniversary. A beloved community event attended by people throughout the Bay Area, the Marin County Fair has for decades brought together families, friends, craftspersons, local vendors and more in this historic celebration of Marin County’s people and products. Held this year at the Marin Center in San Rafael from June 30 to July 4, the award-win-ning Marin County Fair has been held almost annually since its 1925 inception as the Marin County Fair and Harvest Festival. With a wide range of activities for participants, the 2016 fair features over 800 new and returning ex-hibits, from photography competitions to cul-inary contests to performing arts and beyond. Additionally, the fair hosts concerts, rides, fire-works, and other attractions throughout its five-day run. The Marin County Fair is notable not just for its cultural contributions to the community, but for its commitment to environmentally friendly practices and healthy living. From its solar- powered carousel to food recovery and composting services, the ‘‘Greenest County Fair on Earth’’ has been a longtime pioneer in sustainable event management. Additionally, the fair’s health-conscious efforts, like empha-sizing nutritional food from vendors and en-couraging attendees to bike, have warranted wide-spread recognition, including as the Mer-rill Award winner at the 53rd Western Fairs Association Annual Achievement Awards Pro-gram. By integrating stewardship and wellness into the fabric of the fair, the Marin County Fair preserves its legacy as ‘‘the people’s fair’’ while ensuring the event can continue for dec-ades to come. This year’s theme, ‘‘What a Ride!’’ is appro-priate for the diamond anniversary of the fair and its decades of history and importance in Marin County. Mr. Speaker, it is therefore fit-ting to honor the Marin County Fair on their 75th year for their ongoing presence in our community. f 
RECOGNIZING MIRIAM CENTER’S 90TH BIRTHDAY 
HON. EARL L. ‘‘BUDDY’’ CARTER 
OF GEORGIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, July 18, 2016 Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Miriam K. Center of Savan-nah, Georgia, for her 90th birthday on August 10th. At 90 years old, Ms. Center continues to be an impressive member and contributor to the coastal Georgia community. She graduated from Savannah High School in 1944 and promptly joined the Savannah vol-unteers to help American troops fighting in World War II. After the war, Miriam married Leo Center and helped him found a promi-nent, local Savannah business. Miriam and Leo had 3 sons together, Henry, Tony, and Scott. Since then, Miriam has been greatly in-volved in public service as she served as Chair of the Savannah-Chatham Metropolitan Planning Commission, ran for election to the Georgia State Senate, and for Savannah Al-derwoman. In 2000, she wrote a book entitled Scarlett O’Hara Can Go to Hell and produced the currently showing play, Johnny and Me, which chronicles her friendship with Savan-nah’s Academy Award winning songwriter, Johnny Mercer. She is also a frequent guest writer to the Savannah Morning News. Miriam has traveled the world, visiting Eng-land, France, Spain, Greece, Israel, Russia, and much of North America. Ms. Center, I hope you have a happy 90th birthday. PERSONAL EXPLANATION HON. JAIME HERRERA BEUTLER

CONGRATULATING THE FLORIDA SOUTHERN MOCCASINS WOMEN’S LACROSSE TEAM ON WINNING THE 2016 NCAA DIVISION II NA-TIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP 
HON. DENNIS A. ROSS 
OF FLORIDA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, July 18, 2016 Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, Florida Southern College is a liberal arts college nestled in my hometown of Lakeland, Florida. Florida South-ern is known for its strong academic record, for being the largest collection of Frank Lloyd Wright architecture in the world, and for con-sistently receiving recognition from the Prince-ton Review as one of the most beautiful cam-puses in the country. However, today I rise to recognize another important distinction for Florida Southern. The Florida Southern Moccasins Women’s Lacrosse Team recently captured the 2016 NCAA Division II National Championship. On May 21, 2016, the Mocs defeated the two-time defending champion, Adelphi Univer-sity, by a score of 8–7, capping off a remark-able season. NCAA Division II Coach of the Year Kara Reber led the Mocs Women’s Lacrosse Team to their first national championship, along with All Americans Gabby Barowski and Emily Santoli. Growing up in Lakeland, I have watched Florida Southern flourish before my eyes. This victory marks Florida Southern’s 29th NCAA Division II Championship. Florida Southern is a tremendous edu-cational institution, and this win is a terrific achievement not only for the school, but also for our local community. Go Mocs!

recognizing Officer Brandon Murphy for the service he has provided to Michigan’s Fifth Congressional District and the Bay City com-munity. Brandon Murphy is a recipient of the Police Officers Association of Michigan’s (POAM) Po-lice Officer of the Year Award. This honor was awarded following an encounter where Officer Murphy was injured by gunfire while success-fully managing to apprehend a suspect and stop a violent crime spree. Officer Murphy’s personal dedication to public safety at the cost of his own safety deserves the utmost honor, and a Police Officer of the Year Award is a worthy and deserving recognition for such an exemplary officer. It is my honor to represent such brave and honorable members of our community, and Officer Brandon Murphy is a shining example. The true measure of an exemplary public safety officer was exhibited by Officer Murphy when he sacrificed his own wellbeing in order to prevent the further victimization of the com-munity he serves. Mr. Speaker, I applaud the work done by Officer Brandon Murphy and thank him for the service he has provided to our community.

TRIBUTE TO JOHN AND SUSAN BURKE 
HON. STEPHEN F. LYNCH 
OF MASSACHUSETTS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, July 18, 2016 Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to John and Susan Burke who will be celebrating their 50th Wedding Anniversary on August 6, 2016. John and Susan were married at Saint Gregory’s Church in Dorchester, MA. on Au-gust 6, 1966. Susan attended St. Gregory’s High School and graduated from Boston State Teachers College. John grew up in South Boston, attended Boston Technical High School, graduated from the University of Mas-sachusetts at Amherst, and served our country in the U.S. Army for three years. Upon his re-turn home, John worked for the Boston Edison Company and was former Congressman Joe Moakley’s Administrative Assistant. John and Susan are proud parents of their two daughters, Courtney Murray and Patricia Lombardozzi and are blessed with five grandsons; Michael, Patrick and John Murray and Declan and Luke Lombardozzi as well their two son-in-laws, Tim Murray and Santiago Lombardozzi. Mr. Speaker, I have known John and his brothers, Gerry, Kevin, Tim, Patrick and Brian for nearly four decades, they are a proud South Boston family. It is truly an honor and a pleasure to be able to share in this joyous occasion with a great couple and a wonderful family. I know that John and Susan are look-ing forward to celebrating their 50 years of marriage next month with their friends and family and I want to again congratulate them both on this wondrous occasion. RECOGNIZING JIM SPARKS HON. EARL L. ‘‘BUDDY’’ CARTER 
OF GEORGIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, July 18, 2016 Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Jim Sparks, a high school teacher in Georgia’s First Congres-sional District for 26 years. In 1994, while in his late 30s, Mr. Sparks left a corporate position in the transportation industry to pursue a career in education. At first, when he was hired by the Camden County school system, little did he expect that he would spend 26 years teaching and change a countless number of students’ lives. During his tenure, he has mainly taught high school U.S. history, but as Mr. Sparks says, his job was not to teach a particular class, it was to teach students. Since Mr. Sparks has been at Camden County High School it has more than quad-rupled in the number of students. Mr. Sparks used his previous life experi-ences as a soldier in Vietnam and a corporate officer in the transportation industry to bring a unique dynamic to the classroom. This school year was his last, as Mr. Sparks is retired at the end of the year. His dedication to develop young minds is something that should inspire us all and I am thankful for his service to the youth of the First Congressional District of Georgia.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE AND SERVICE OF CLAUDE MILLER 
HON. DANIEL T. KILDEE 
OF MICHIGAN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, July 18, 2016 Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I ask the United States House of Representatives to join me in recognizing Mr. Claude Miller for his life of service, and artistic contributions to the State of Michigan and to my hometown of Flint, Michigan. On January 16, 2016, at the age of 74 years old Claude Miller died, leaving behind his wife and children. Throughout his long life, Claude was a testament to the community champions that form the foundations of our communities. Following an honorable dis-charge from service in the United States Air Force, Claude eventually settled in Flint, Michigan. There he dedicated his life to serv-ice as an advocate for the city he loved. A tireless volunteer, Claude was the very em-bodiment of the ‘Strong, Proud’ spirit of Flint. Claude had a passion for art, spending much of his remaining free time drawing, painting and taking classes at Mott Community College. There he built a reputation for his ar-tistic abilities and passion for his craft. Fol-lowing his death, the college hosted an exhi-bition of his art titled, ‘‘Faces, Places, and Spaces.’’ One piece depicting President Barack Obama was featured among that col-lection. That piece has made the long journey to Washington, D.C. where it has been proud-ly displayed in my office for the last week, prior to being committed to the White House and the President. Mr. Speaker, I applaud the life of Claude Miller for his commitment to our community, and for his artistic contributions. His life re-minds us that art and service can become the cornerstones of a community and a life well lived. f 
VICTIMS IN CHINA, CUBA, MALAY-SIA ILL–SERVED BY TRAF-FICKING IN PERSONS REPORT 
HON. CHRISTOPHER H. SMITH 
OF NEW JERSEY  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, July 18, 2016 Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 launched a bold comprehensive public-private sector strategy that included sheltering, polit-ical asylum, and other protections for the vic-tims; long jail sentences and asset confisca-tion for the traffickers; a myriad of preventative initiatives and tough sanctions for govern-ments that failed to meet minimum standards prescribed in the TVPA. As the prime sponsor of that law, which also created the Trafficking in Persons (TIP) Report and tier rankings, I remain deeply dis-appointed and concerned that both last year’s TIP Report and the current one gave passing grades to several nations with horrific records of government complicity in human trafficking. Falsifying a country’s human trafficking record not only undermines the credibility of the re-port but was especially dehumanizing to the victims who suffer rape, cruelty and horrifying exploitation. The politically contrived passing grades for more than a dozen failing governments was exposed by a series of investigative reports by Reuters, which found that the professionals at the State Department’s TIP office made one set of recommendations—only to be overruled at a higher level for political reasons. A hearing I held last week looked closely at the newly released Trafficking in Persons Re-port, which assesses and ranks 188 countries each year on their records of prosecuting traf-fickers, protecting victims, and preventing human trafficking. Sadly, this year’s TIP Report has again failed many victims. Some of the rankings comport with the records of certain countries. Burma and Uzbekistan, for example, are des-ignated Tier 3—as they should be. But other nations including trading partners Malaysia and China are given a free pass despite their horrific records of government complicity in human trafficking. Cuba, a dictatorship highly favored by this administration, is again falsely touted with a passing grade. China was also allowed to keep its Tier 2 Watch List ranking, despite the fact that the reason for their upgrade two years ago was found to be a fraud. Alexandra Harney, Jason Szep, and Matt Spetalnick of Reuters authored an expose on China’s politicized ranking, finding that, ‘‘Two years after China announced it was ending the ‘‘re-education through labor’’ system, extrajudicial networks of detention facilities featuring torture and forced labor thrive in its place.’’ China had deceived the U.S. in 2014, and when that became apparent last year—we let them keep their ill-gotten upgrade in 2015, and again in 2016. I chair the Congressional- Executive Commission on China and based on both sex and labor trafficking, China de-serves a Tier 3 ranking—egregious violator—

as much if not more than any other nation on the list. Malaysia, whose ranking was upgraded to the Tier 2 Watch List last year on the flimsiest of justifications and fears it would be disquali-fied from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, was allowed to maintain its Tier 2 Watch List rank-ing—despite the fact that Malaysia faltered in its anti-trafficking progress over the last year. In fact, Malaysia, a country with 4 million mi-grant workers, prosecuted fewer trafficking cases and convicted only 7 traffickers last year—that’s less than when it was a Tier 3 country. Meanwhile, women from Burma, Vietnam, Cambodia, the Philippines, and Nepal are traf-ficked to China for forced marriages or sexual exploitation. North Korean laborers worked under conditions described by experts as forced or slave labor to earn income for the North Korean government. Prisoners of con-science and other prisoners continue to be held in administration detention facilities where there are numerous credible reports of pris-oners being trafficked for the purpose of organ harvesting. The State Department must get the TIP Re-port right, or we will lose the foundational tool created to help the more than 20 million vic-tims of trafficking enslaved around the world today. A tier ranking is about protecting vulnerable lives—lives destroyed or saved by the on-the- ground impact of a government’s inaction or action. The easiest cases for a Tier 3 ranking should be those where the government itself is profiting from human trafficking, such as in Cuba, where thousands of Cuban medical pro-fessionals labor in dangerous countries not of their choosing, their passports taken, their movements restricted, their families and li-censes threatened—and their salaries heavily garnished—by the Cuban government. It is not a coincidence that Cuban law does not recog-nize labor trafficking. Maria Werlau testified at our hearing in March that, ‘‘. . . trafficking is a huge operation run by the government through numerous state enterprises with . . . accomplices, partici-pants, sponsors, and promoters all over the world.’’ Cuba is also a known destination for child sex tourists, and Cuba reports no convic-tions for child sex tourism. Yet, Cuba is ranked Tier 2 Watch List. We’ve seen many countries take a Tier 3 ranking seriously and make real, systemic changes that improved their tier rankings, but more importantly, protected trafficking vic-tims—countries such as South Korea and Israel. When the Bush administration branded South Korea and Israel Tier 3 based on their records, both countries enacted and imple-mented policies to combat human trafficking and were given earned upgrades for their verifiable actions. But other countries attempt to end-run the accountability system with end-less, empty promises of action or mostly meaningless gestures of compliance. China sat on the Tier 2 Watch List for eight years, each year promising the State Depart-ment they would implement their anti-traf-ficking plan. Each year, the State Department took the bait until Congress put a limit on the Tier 2 Watch List—two years only, unless the President gives the country a waiver. Well, China has once again promised to implement a plan—and the President just gave them a waiver to stay on the Watch List a third year. Tier rankings are about real prosecutions, real prevention, and real protection—for real people who are suffering as slaves. The TIP Report was meant to speak for the trafficking victims waiting, hoping, and praying for relief. While the 2016 TIP Report speaks for many of them, too many are still unheard.

PERSONAL EXPLANATION ON CON-CURRING IN THE SENATE AMENDMENT TO THE HOUSE AMENDMENT TO S. 764 
HON. JOSEPH CROWLEY 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, July 18, 2016 Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I regret that I was not present for the vote on concurring in the Senate Amendment to the House Amend-ment to S. 764, dealing with labeling require-ments for genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Had I been here, I would have sup-ported this legislation as a step forward in im-proving consumers’ right to know more about the products they consume. I appreciate that many of my constituents, like many across the country, have expressed a desire to know whether the food they pur-chase and consume contains GMO ingredi-ents. However, the status quo does not work for consumers, for manufacturers, or for our country. Today, if a consumer wants to know more about where the ingredients in their food come from, it is far from an easy process. Some manufacturers choose to print it on the pack-aging, others don’t. Some define a genetically- modified ingredient one way, others another. There’s not much more clarity right now for food manufacturers. Depending on the state or even city, they may face different require-ments about what foods to label, what ingredi-ents need to be labeled, or how the label should look. Many companies have started taking steps to provide more information, but the lack of a consistent standard makes it dif-ficult for consumers to access this information in an easy way. The bill that came before the House is not perfect, but I believe it moves us in the right direction. It creates a national standard, in-stead of a patchwork of state and local laws. And under this standard, it will be mandatory, not voluntary, for manufacturers to disclose whether a product has genetically-modified in-gredients, which will now be clearly defined. The measure includes some flexibility for manufacturers to determine for their products what format makes the most sense for this disclosure, but I am pleased that there are clear requirements in place that this disclosure must meet. There is certainly more that can be done to build awareness about what to look for on packaging and how the information can be used, and so I believe this bill can be the first step in a process of education and in-formation-sharing that will help consumers. I also believe the use of electronic scannable codes holds a lot of promise, particularly as manufacturers come together to standardize the codes and information that is provided. I strongly feel that this information should re-main easily accessible to the consumer, so that once a code is scanned, there is a direct link to information such as GMO disclosure, ingredients, and nutrition facts. I am heartened that many manufacturers have begun recog-nizing the need to make this information clear-ly available, and I look forward to continued progress in this area. Overall, I believe that the legislation consid-ered by the House is a needed step forward from the situation we have today, and a sig-nificant improvement from previous legislation that did not require the kind of labeling that consumers have asked for. I support this version of the legislation, and I look forward to continuing to work to strengthen our food safe-ty, nutrition, and anti-hunger laws and pro-grams so that all consumers are able to ac-cess healthy, affordable food for themselves and their families.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, July 18, 2016 Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Ware County High School Robotics Team for winning the world championship at the 2016 Vex World Robotics Championship in Louisville, Kentucky. The students of Ware County High sub-mitted two robots into the tournament—2015C, known as C–Bot, and 2015A, known as A– Bot. Both robots performed extremely well in Louisville, in the qualifying rounds. C–Bot won 4th place in programming skills while A–Bot finished with a high ranking in technology skills. Each robot finished in the top 50 within their divisions. Because of its performance in the qualifying rounds, the C–Bot was chosen to be part of a small team to compete for the world title where it was allied with robots from Con-necticut. This alliance won the final competition for the world championship. The world title is an impressive achievement as 500 teams from North and South America, Asia, Europe, and the Middle East competed for the prestigious honor. I rise today to congratulate the Ware County High students on their hard work and achieve-ment as they bring world-wide recognition to their school and the First Congressional Dis-trict of Georgia.

THE CASTRO REGIME’S ONGOING VIOLATIONS OF CIVIL AND PO-LITICAL RIGHTS 
HON. CHRISTOPHER H. SMITH 
OF NEW JERSEY  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, July 18, 2016 Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, it has been one year and eight months since President Obama announced a major change in our country’s policy towards Cuba. It has been eleven months since Secretary Kerry visited Havana and reopened our em-bassy. And it has been nearly four months since our President visited Cuba. Clearly, a lot has changed in just over a year and a half. But for the people of Cuba, what has changed? At a hearing I convened last week, we ex-amined the sorry state of civil and political rights in the Castro brothers’ Cuba, and how, despite all the promises by this administration that an opening to Cuba will lead to a greater opening domestically for the Cuban people we still see political repression—including, it must be noted, repression directed at the Afro- Cuban population. This is not the first time this subcommittee has expressed concern about the lack of openness to democracy and dissent in Cuba. In fact, one of our witnesses, the courageous Dr. Oscar Biscet, offered dramatic testimony before this subcommittee in February of 2012, when he testified via telephone from the U.S. Interests Section in Havana after evading the Cuban police to get there. Likewise, on February 5, 2015 we held a hearing entitled ‘‘Human Rights in Cuba: An opportunity squandered,’’ wherein we asked whether the Obama administration had used the considerable leverage that it wields to seek to better the condition of the Cuban peo-ple, or whether it was squandering the oppor-tunity. Since then, our fear that the administration has not been pushing sufficiently for the re-lease of political prisoners and other human rights concerns has only grown, with the focus on Obama’s ‘‘legacy’’ instead of the Cuban people. For example, when President Obama made his visit to Cuba, he and Raul Castro ap-peared in a photo op press conference. CNN’s Jim Acosta, much to his credit, asked the hard question about Cuba’s political prisoners. Raul Castro, much to his discredit, denied that there were ANY political prisoners in Cuba. ‘‘Give me a list of the political prisoners and I will release them immediately,’’ Castro taunted. ‘‘Just mention the list.’’ And President Obama just stood there. Well, Mr. President, I have a list, of more than fifty political prisoners compiled by my good friend and colleague I
LEANA ROS- L
EHTINEN . This is a list that President Obama should have had in breast pocket, ready to pull out when Raul Castro dared him to call his bluff. When I came to Congress in 1981, with Ronald Reagan, in the days of the old Soviet Union, one of the first issues I worked on was the plight of Soviet Jews and refusniks who were either imprisoned or not allowed to leave the Soviet Union. I recall George Shultz, when he was Secretary of State, saying that when-ever he met with his Soviet counterpart, and from him down to the lowest State Department officer, he would bring with him a list of impris-oned dissidents and human rights advocates. Front and center of any discussion, whether about nuclear arms or tensions in the Middle East, Secretary Shultz would bring up dis-sidents, naming them by name. It was this constant focus on human rights that helped move the Soviet government to allow Jews and others to leave the Soviet Union, people such as the great Natan Sharansky. And I have another list of names, that of six members of the Cuban National Front of Civic Resistance who have applied for visas to come to the United States but for some rea-son, inexplicably, our State Department has refused to allow to visit the United States. These are: Orlando Go´mez Echavarrı´a Jose Alberto Alvarez Bravo Yaı´te Diasnell Cruz Sosa Yoel Bravo Lo´pez La´zaro Ricardo Fiallo Lo´pez Ciro Aleixis Casanova Pe´rez I call upon Secretary Kerry to allow these brave people entry to the United States, so that they can meet with me and my colleagues and enlighten us further as to the current state of affairs in Cuba. Finally, I note that the administration has failed to secure the release of fugitives from justice such as Joanne Chesimard, who is on the FBI’s Most Wanted Terrorist list, convicted of killing New Jersey State Trooper Werner Foerster. The administration must insist upon the unconditional return of Chesimard and all other fugitives from justice, as well as demand that the Castro regime respect the civil and political rights of the Cuban people, before making any further concessions. And to underscore the point, unconditional means unconditional—there should be no ‘‘swap’’ whereby we exchange convicted Cuban spies Ana Montes or Kendall Meyers for these fugitives as a concession to the Cas-tro regime. The effect of that would be to trade Americans who have committed crimes in the United States for other Americans who have committed crimes in the United States, demor-alizing our intelligence community further in the process. With that, I want to turn to our witnesses, noting as I do that last week, on July 13, it was the anniversary of the tugboat massacre of 1994, when 37 victims, including 11 chil-dren, were killed by the regime. How little has changed for the Cuban people. f

Who before us now so stands For life is so very short So then what is it that we all hope to sport? All in the days of our lives report And who do we lift up? When in tough times never giving up? To make our lives so buff All in our reps of life’s as such Do we dare to push the envelope? To make dynamic gains all in our approach All in what our heart’s invoke For we only have so many rep’s to our world bless To be the best We must be bold, We must be strong We must work hard all day and night long If we wish to write our life’s song And as the years progress some of us shall not grow old Men like arnold never do so Whose heart’s never run cold With his heart of a child so yo Who see’s the good in all he beholds Whose smile to all heart’s call so Who never stop’s believing as new dreams he conceiving For he knows not the word defeat even And failure is not an option conceiving All in his austrian-american heart which is beating Is a heart of a child who against all odds is competing As he let’s his dreams run wild With his greatest of all smiles and cham-pionship style If you want to get to the mountain top? There’s only one way, straight up 69 rep’s, but there’s a lot more left In this american hero to flex Maybe, sixty-nine more? ‘‘work out, do it now’’ ‘‘crush it’’ ‘‘get in the chopper’’ 69 rep’s to be the best.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, July 18, 2016 Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. Ben Slade and all of his accomplishments as Executive Director of the St. Simons Land Trust. Over the last 11 years, the St. Simons Land Trust has worked to preserve land on St. Si-mons Island, Georgia, which is home to 12,000 residents as well as many marshes, creeks, rivers, and fish. The Land Trust works with willing property owners to preserve the beautiful land of this region and its significance to Georgia’s natural habitat. Mr. Slade has worked with the St. Simons Land Trust since its inception, leading the company from a small group to an organiza-tion that now includes 1,250 member house-holds and 776 acres of land. During his time with the organization, Mr. Slade’s numerous accomplishments have been critical to the en-vironmental success of the island. One of his most important accomplishments was his leadership in the purchase of the 604 acre Cannon’s Point area on St. Simons—the last intact maritime forest on the island. Later this year, Mr. Slade will retire as the Executive Director of the St. Simons Land Trust. I rise today to recognize his effort and accomplishments in bettering the island of St. Simon and wish him the best with his future endeavors.

HOPE DEFERRED: SECURING EN-FORCEMENT OF THE GOLDMAN ACT TO RETURN ABDUCTED AMERICAN CHILDREN 
HON. CHRISTOPHER H. SMITH 
OF NEW JERSEY  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, July 18, 2016 Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank everyone, especially all of the left-behind parents, who attended a hearing I convened last week to discuss what the U.S. Department of State’s second annual report under the Sean and David Goldman Inter-national Child Abduction Prevention and Re-turn Act tells us about the Department’s imple-mentation of the Goldman Act thus far. On a positive note, the numbers of new ab-ductions from the United States in 2015 re-mained below their pre-Goldman Act mark, probably due to increased abduction preven-tion. According to the report, 600 more children were abducted to other countries last year, quickly replacing the 299 children, abducted in various years, who were returned. Overall, ap-proximately 1,000 children remain in a foreign country, separated from their American parent. As many of you have experienced, inter-national parental child abduction rips children from their homes and whisks them away to a foreign land, alienating them from the love and care of the parent and family left behind. Child abduction is child abuse, and it con-tinues to plague families across the United States. For decades, the State Department has used ‘‘quiet diplomacy’’ to attempt to bring these children home. In a hearing I held on this issue back in 2009, then-Assistant Sec-retary of State Bernie Aronson called quiet di-plomacy ‘‘a sophisticated form of begging.’’ Thousands of American families still ruptured and grieving from years of unresolved abduc-tions confirm that quiet diplomacy is gravely inadequate. In 2014, Congress unanimously passed the Goldman Act to give teeth to requests for re-turn and access. The actions against non-co-operating governments required by the law es-calate in severity, and range from official pro-tests through diplomatic channels to the sus-pension of development, security, or other for-eign assistance. Extradition of abducting par-ents also may be the case. The Goldman Act is a law calculated to get results, as we did in the return of Sean Gold-man from Brazil in 2008. This year’s report, as required by the Gold-man Act, singles out 19 countries in total, in-cluding India, Brazil, Japan, and Tunisia for failures to work with the United States in the return of abducted American children. For instance, the report notes 83 abductions to India still open at the end of the year—with 25 of those being new in 2015. Only one was closed with a court-ordered return to the United States. These numbers will continue to climb each year until India creates a mecha-nism for resolution. Right now India is a mag-net for abductions because taking parents are almost guaranteed to get away with their crime. Brazil had 17 abduction cases open at the end of 2015 with a 27 percent resolution rate. Brazil has been a Convention partner with the United States since 2003, and yet consistently fails to comply with the Convention. Devon Davenport, who has testified before this Sub-committee, has won every one of his 24 ap-peals in Brazil’s Courts over the last 7 years— and yet he still cannot get his daughter Nadia home. If there was ever a textbook case for sanc-tions, Brazil is it—they have met the legal threshold 10 times over. The Report lists Japan as a ‘‘country that has failed to comply with one or more of its Hague Convention obligations’’, specifically ‘‘in the area of enforcement of return orders.’’ Multiple parents have won pyrrhic victories in court, only to discover Japan has what the re-port calls ‘‘systemic flaws’’ with enforcement. What remains inexplicable is why Japan was kept off the list of non-compliant countries for a second year in a row when even the State Department condemned them for ‘‘sys-temic flaws’’ in their ability to enforce court or-ders to return U.S. children. Failure to enforce return orders is an automatic trigger for land-ing on the non-compliant list. One parent had to go outside the Conven-tion framework to achieve enforcement in an extraordinary case resolved after the reporting period. The report should have also counted against Japan the 40 pre-Convention abduc-tion cases it mentions as still pending—most of them for more than 5 years. Countries should be listed as worst offend-ers if they have high numbers of cases—30 percent or more—that have been pending more than a year. Countries also may be so listed if their law enforcement, judiciary, or central authority for abduction regularly fails in their duties under The Hague Convention or other controlling agreement; or if the country simply fails to work with the U.S. to resolve cases. Accurate reporting, including inclusion on the worst offenders list, is critical to family court judges across the country and parents considering their child’s travel to a foreign country where abduction or access problems are a risk. However, reporting is just step one. Once these countries are properly classified, the Secretary of State then determines which of the aforementioned actions the U.S. will apply to the country in order to encourage the timely resolution of cases. Such actions could bring an end to the nightmare of the Elias family, whose children, Jade and Michael, have been missing in Japan for 8 years. Such actions could end the nightmares of any of the parents who shared their stories at last week’s hearing.
