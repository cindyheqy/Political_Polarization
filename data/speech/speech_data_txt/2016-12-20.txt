CONGRATULATING CURTIS HIGH SCHOOL 
HON. DANIEL M. DONOVAN, JR. 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, December 20, 2016 Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Curtis High School football team for winning the Public Schools Athletic League city championship. After steamrolling their opponents through-out the regular season and playoffs, the War-riors defeated Erasmus Hall High School 24– 21 at Yankee Stadium to capture the cham-pionship title and finish the season ranked first overall in New York City. Closing out their season with an undefeated 12–0 record, these young athletes proved that hard work, dedica-tion, and perseverance are the keys to victory. The Warriors never backed down from tough competition this past season, and they defi-nitely won’t back down next season. Led by head coach Peter ‘‘Gambo’’ Gambardella, the Warriors demonstrated noth-ing but pure excellence on the field. Moreover, this team showed its dominance in the stats. Wide receiver Amad Anderson, Jr. finished the regular season tied first overall in touchdown receptions in the league; running back Ty’Son Lawton finished second in rushing yards and tied for first in rushing touchdowns; and quar-terback Quincy Barnes finished second in passing yards and first in passing touchdowns. But as each of them knows, you always put your team before any personal glory. The Warriors exemplified teamwork and coopera-tion, so their championship should come as no surprise to their classmates, teachers, or par-ents. Mr. Speaker, this team gave their time, ef-fort, and sweat to be where they are today. Their championship was well-deserved and I wish them nothing but continued success.

Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Mr. Carlo Scissura, who is receiving Greenpoint YMCA’s Spirit of Service Award, given in recognition of Mr. Scissura’s efforts to better the community in which he lives and works. Mr. Scissura has worked to expand and strengthen the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce, making it the largest and fastest-growing Chamber of Commerce in New York State. In 2012, Mr. Scissura became President and CEO of the Brooklyn Chamber of Com-merce. The Chamber is one of New York’s premiere business advocacy and leadership organizations. Under Mr. Scissura’s leader-ship, membership in the Chamber has grown by more than 200 percent. Mr. Scissura has launched a series of highly successful and in-novative programs, including Explore Brook-lyn, Brooklyn-Made and Chamber on the Go, leading to a historic period of growth and de-velopment in the Chamber. The Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce has become a na-tional model for business development, out-reach and technical assistance, and regional branding. Prior to joining the Chamber, Mr. Scissura served as both Chief of Staff and General Counsel to former Brooklyn Borough President Marty Markowitz. In this role, Mr. Scissura fo-cused on advancing the Borough’s economic development agenda. Mr. Scissura worked alongside the Mayor’s Office, Council, and Economic Development Corporation (EDC), and served on the boards of EDC, the Brook-lyn Navy Yard Development Corporation and Brooklyn Public Library. In addition to his professional success, Mr. Scissura has a long history of service to his community. This began nearly twenty years ago, when he was elected to Community School Board 20 in 1999. During his time on the Board, Mr. Scissura reinvigorated various Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Commit-tees. In recognition of his outstanding dedica-tion, Mr. Scissura was appointed to the Com-munity Education Council in 2004, where he served as President and Chairman of the Leg-islative Committee. In this position, Mr. Scissura continued his advocacy for increased community and parental involvement. Today, Mr. Scissura serves as Vice President of the Federation of Italian-American Organizations, where he has led the construction of the new Italian Cultural and Community Center. Mr. Scissura has received numerous honors and awards for these contributions to his commu-nity. Mr. Scissura was born and raised in Bensonhurst, and currently resides in Dyker Heights. As a lifetime Brooklyn resident, Mr. Scissura has been an advocate for Brooklyn throughout his career. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating Mr. Carlo Scissura for his con-tinuous commitment to improving his commu-nity and his incredible leadership of the Brook-lyn Chamber of Commerce.

OF OHIO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, December 20, 2016 Mr. WENSTRUP.

HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS 
OF FLORIDA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, December 20, 2016 Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Pahokee Senior High School foot-ball team of Pahokee, Florida. On December 8, 2016, the Pahokee Blue Devils won their 7th state championship. They finished their season 14–0, defeating all of Florida’s top rated teams in Class 1A. Along the way, the Blue Devils won the Muck Bowl, which annu-ally pits them against the Raiders of Glades Central High School in Belle Glade, Florida, one of Florida’s most well-known rivalries, for the first time in eight years. First year coach Mr. Orson Walkes, who won four state titles with the team as an as-sistant, guided his very talented players to the peak of perfection. With their winning effort in 2016, they have shown the potential for future championships. While the seniors will be add-ing their skills to the football teams of some of America’s finest colleges and universities next season, returning players will be joined by other talented players in what will surely be another exciting season for the Blue Devils. Mr. Speaker, The Blue Devils of Pahokee, Florida are the only football team from Palm Beach County to win a state championship this year. I am delighted that such a fine coach and extremely talented group of players represent my Congressional district.

Borough President Diana Reyna, who is re-ceiving Greenpoint YMCA’s Spirit of Service Award, given in recognition of her efforts to better the community in which she lives and serves. Deputy Borough President Reyna has been a dynamic and effective leader who has worked for real change. Deputy Borough President Reyna made his-tory as the first Dominican-American woman elected to public office in New York State when she won her seat in the New York City Council in 2001. As a Councilwoman, she gar-nered praise as an advocate for affordable housing and economic development, and she pushed for funding for family literacy and youth programs. Additionally, she has been a tireless supporter of women and minority owned small businesses, supported high-tech innovation, and encouraged entrepreneurs and start-up companies. She also sought to fight crime in her district. She authored a bill that increased fines for illegal conversions from in-dustrial to residential uses, which passed the Council in 2007 and was signed into law by Mayor Bloomberg. Ms. Reyna became Deputy Brooklyn Bor-ough President in 2014. As Deputy Borough President, Ms. Reyna has been a champion for the BQ Green Project, which would create a park that connects communities separated by the Brooklyn Queens Expressway, allowing for new open spaces, bolstering local busi-nesses, and improving quality of life for thou-sands of residents in the community. She has also fought for zoning laws that would allow for affordable industrial spaces to remain in Brooklyn in an effort to keep industry and jobs in the borough. In every position she has held, Deputy Bor-ough President Reyna has demonstrated dedi-cation to families and businesses in our great city. She is a tenacious and effective public servant who has instituted great changes to the borough of Brooklyn and New York City at large. Deputy Borough President Reyna has lived in New York her whole life, growing up in Brooklyn. She attended Pace University in Pleasantville, New York. From there, she went on to work as Chief of Staff for a New York State Assembly member. Deputy Borough President Reyna is a proud resident of Brook-lyn, NY, a place she believes ‘‘holds our fu-ture, our children, our neighbors, our artists, our entrepreneurs, our schools, and our busi-nesses.’’ Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating Brooklyn Deputy Borough Presi-dent Diana Reyna for her continuous commit-ment to improving her community, city, and country.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF THE HONORABLE W.J. ‘‘BILL’’ USERY 
HON. JODY B. HICE 
OF GEORGIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, December 20, 2016 Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of the late Honor-able W.J. ‘‘Bill’’ Usery Jr., a man who left a legacy of service to our Nation and the Tenth Congressional District of Georgia, which I have the honor of representing. Mr. Usery was a native of Baldwin County where he attended Georgia Military College. Shortly after, he proudly served in the United States Navy re-pairing warships as an underwater welder in the Pacific Fleet. In 1952, he started his ca-reer in labor activism when he joined the Inter-national Association of Machinists. Following years of being the chief mediator in major labor-management disputes, Presi-dent Gerald Ford appointed Mr. Usery as the United States Secretary of Labor, a post where he defined the modern era of labor- management and helped our Nation maintain its forward momentum and status as a global leader. During his tenure, our Nation wit-nessed better working conditions, better wages, better relations between labor and management, and an overall better way of life. Mr. Speaker, his advice and counsel were valued by the Commander-in-Chiefs whom he served, including Presidents Gerald Ford, Richard Nixon, John F. Kennedy, and Bill Clin-ton. The Honorable Mr. Usery was born, raised, and spent the last years of his life in Milledgeville, Georgia, where he continued to serve, making generous donations to his alma mater. Mr. Speaker, I had the privilege to meet this remarkable Georgian this spring during a cere-mony that I held in my district to recognize our WWII veterans, and it is with pride that I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the life and legacy of the Honorable W.J. ‘‘Bill’’ Usery. f 
IN RECOGNITION OF JOHN CATSIMATIDIS JR. 
HON. CAROLYN B. MALONEY 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, December 20, 2016 Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Mr. John Catsimatidis Jr. who is receiving Greenpoint YMCA’s Spirit of Service Award, given in rec-ognition of Mr. Catsimatidis’s efforts to better the city of New York. Mr. Catsimatidis is a driven and hard-working New Yorker who has shown dedication both to his business en-deavors and philanthropic causes. Mr. Catsimatidis serves as an executive of the Red Apple Group, where he is involved in all areas of the business, but focuses mainly on the energy resources, investment divisions, and job creation. In August, 2016, Mr. Catsimatidis was also appointed to the board of the Gold Coast Bank in Brooklyn, NY. Mr. Catsimatidis has always been involved in various philanthropic activities. Mr. Catsimatidis supports the Catsimatidis Family Foundation, which makes generous donations to organizations including the Police Athletic League and the Alzheimer’s Association. Mr. Catsimatidis also serves on the Emerging Leaders Council for the Federal Enforcement Homeland Security Foundation, which pro-vides financial aid, scholarships, grants, and critical support to Federal Law Enforcement officers and their families in times of need. Mr. Catsimatidis’s steadfast support of these fami-lies throughout New York City exemplifies his dedication to our community. Mr. Catsimatidis graduated from New York University’s Leonard Stern School of Business in 2015. While at NYU, Mr. Catsimatidis served as President of the NYU College Re-publicans, a premier political organization on campus. This position gave Mr. Catsimatidis the opportunity to hold debates, host speak-ers, and cultivate informational political dia-logues for the student body. Additionally, Mr. Catsimatidis was elected Chairman of the New York State Federation of College Republicans. In both of these positions, Mr. Catsimatidis sought not only to contribute to politically ac-tive student groups on campus, but more im-portantly to foster healthy, respectful, and bi-lateral political discussion. For his contribu-tions to the NYU community, Mr. Catsimatidis was named one of NYU’s Ten Most Influential Students of 2015, and received the Presi-dential Service Award. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating Mr. John Catsimatidis Jr. for his contributions to New York’s vibrant business community and dedication to local philan-thropic causes. f

HON. MIKE COFFMAN

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Korean Language news serv-ice, Weekly Focus, on its 10th Anniversary, and by extension President Hyun Joo Kim, and her entire staff. I am proud to represent the largest Korean community in Colorado in my Congressional District. Throughout the ten years that Weekly Focus has been running, the service has worked tirelessly to not only represent their community, but to also connect Coloradoans by offering a way to commu-nicate and learn from each other. Since its founding in 2006, Weekly Focus has grown to be the biggest and most influen-tial Korean language newspaper in Colorado. Thanks to this tremendous news service, Ko-rean-Americans and Coloradoans have a de-pendable source of news that features a weekly publication of 128 pages. Hyun Joo Kim’s passion and diligence, as well as that of her staff, has allowed Weekly Focus to develop and become an important part of our community.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE HEMO-PHILIA FOUNDATION OF MICHI-GAN FOR ITS SUPPORT OF INDI-VIDUALS AFFECTED BY BLEED-ING DISORDERS 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, December 20, 2016 Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Hemophilia Foundation of Michi-gan for its efforts to provide services and sup-port to individuals affected by bleeding dis-orders. HFM has played a key role in improv-ing care and helping drive advancements in care for these diseases. The Hemophilia Foundation of Michigan was founded in 1956 to promote awareness and improve the welfare of individuals afflicted with bleeding disorders. The organization has ex-panded substantially from the original group of volunteers and now features a full-time staff that handles federal funding for treatment cen-ters in Michigan, Ohio and Indiana. HFM also offers a multitude of support services to help improve the quality of life of those suffering from bleeding disorders. HFM hosts camping programs and retreats for children and adults that educate individuals about their bleeding conditions and help provide a support network for individuals in need. The organization also provides subsidized dental insurance and fi-nancial assistance to help patients afford treat-ment for their diseases. The Hemophilia Foundation of Michigan plays a key role in bringing together research-ers, patients and providers to facilitate effec-tive and affordable care for those affected by bleeding disorders. This integrated care can have significant effects in improving quality of life and providing support that allows patients to better cope with these diseases. The com-mitment of the staff and volunteers for HFM has helped build a world-class organization that continues to effectively serve the Midwest and ensure that individuals with bleeding dis-eases receive the support they need. I am in-spired by the activism and dedication of HFM to advocate on behalf of individuals with these diseases. Their work has impacted countless lives. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me today in recognizing the Hemophilia Founda-tion of Michigan for its outstanding work on behalf of the people of Michigan. It has been key to providing care and support services to individuals with bleeding disorders.

IN RECOGNITION OF ROBERT SANCHO 
HON. CAROLYN B. MALONEY 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, December 20, 2016 Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Mr. Robert Sancho, an experienced Urban Affairs Spe-cialist and cultural activist who has dedicated his career to serving his community. For the past forty-five years, Mr. Sancho has fought to improve the quality of education in New York City’s public schools, and to make healthcare services more accessible in New York City neighborhoods. Today, Mr. Sancho continues his fight as a Member of the Board of Trustees of the Center of Educational Innovation, Icahn Charter Schools, and the Multicultural Committee of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Mr. Sancho was born and raised in the South Bronx. After completing his primary and secondary education in the New York City public schools, Mr. Sancho went on to earn his Bachelor of Arts degree in Education and Political Science at the Inter-American Univer-sity in San German, Puerto Rico, where he was also offered a teaching fellowship. Later, Mr. Sancho was granted a scholarship to the reputable Graduate School of Urban Affairs at Hunter College, where he earned his Master of Science Degree. Mr. Sancho was appointed to serve as Dep-uty Superintendent of Schools in Community School District 4 in East Harlem, which is re-sponsible for roughly 24,000 students. During his time in office, the district rose from 32nd place in reading and math achievements among New York City public school districts, the lowest ranking at the time, to 13th place. This unprecedented rise is considered one of the most successful educational turnarounds in our nation. Thanks to Mr. Sancho’s bold success, Community School District 4 was awarded national competitive grants under his leadership. Mr. Sancho became a community activist in the late 1960s, when then-New York City Mayor John Lindsay tried to shut down the Metropolitan Hospital Center, a public hospital which provided low cost vital health services to the community in East Harlem. Mr. Sancho helped organize the East Harlem community to reject the proposed closure. After a two- year struggle, the city decided to keep the hospital open. In 1981, Mr. Sancho was appointed Vice President of Development and External Affairs at the Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center, which is located in the poorest Congressional District in the nation. As Vice President, Mr. Sancho helped the hospital secure over $240 million in funding, which helped to finance three new hospital buildings and repair existing buildings. Additionally, Mr. Sancho’s department helped raise almost $15 million in the past few years for various hospital programs. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating the extraordinary work of Robert Sancho has done for the great city of New York. f

Thau, President-Elect of the American Optometric Association (AOA), who will be in-stalled as its 95th President during the 119th Congress of the AOA’s House of Delegates. Dr. Thau, a native of the 12th Congressional District in New York, was first elected to the American Optometric Association Board of Trustees in 2007, and has served as its vice president, Speaker of the House Pro Tem, and Chair of the AOA Investment Committee. She is a Fellow of the American Academy of Optometry, a Fellow of the College of Optom-etrists in Vision Development, a Distinguished Practitioner on the National Academies of Practice, and a Diplomate of the American Board of Optometry. Dr. Thau is also a faculty member, associate clinical professor, and former chair of the Admissions Committee at SUNY College of Optometry, where she re-ceived her doctorate. Prior to her election to the AOA Board, Dr. Thau broke new ground as the first woman president of the New York State Optometric Association, the New York Academy of Op-tometry, and the Optometric Society of the City of New York. She has continually used her expertise and success in her field to serve the public, especially children. She is a found-ing member of the New York Children’s Vision Coalition as well as the AOA’s InfantSEE com-mittee, a national program that provides vision assessments to babies at no cost. She has advocated for children’s vision at both the state and national level. Dr. Thau is also the owner of a private practice in Manhattan, Dr. Andrea P. Thau and Associates, which serves as a full-scope primary care practice with a special emphasis on children’s vision and vi-sion therapy. Dr. Thau has been lauded by her peers for her excellence in optometry and has received numerous awards for her outstanding work, in-cluding the 2005 New York State Optometrist of the Year and SUNY Optometry Alumna of the Year. She has also been recognized twice as Vision Monday’s 20 Most Influential Women in Optical. Dr. Thau has long stood out as an example of extraordinary dedication and brilliance in her field.

Since then, Dr. Thau has practiced op-tometry for nearly three decades, consistently providing first-rate eye care to her clients.

HONORING NANCY VORHEES 
HON. CATHY McMORRIS RODGERS 
OF WASHINGTON  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, December 20, 2016 Mrs. M
CMORRIS RODGERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor a good friend and community advocate, Nancy Vorhees, on her retirement as Chief Administrative Office (CAO) of Inland Northwest Health Services (INHS). Nancy first started with Inland nearly two decades ago as Chief Operating Officer of Northwest Health Partners (NHP), which in-cludes Northwest MedStar, Northwest Tele-health, Community Wellness, Health Training, INHS Foundation, and Children’s Miracle Net-work Hospital. All of the divisions under Nan-cy’s direction worked diligently to integrate the delivery of health care services throughout the Inland Northwest. Her work also focused on regional economic development, removal of barriers to health care, quality care, and cus-tomer satisfaction. As a champion of rural medicine, Nancy provided leadership that connected our rural, and often times most vulnerable patients, to health care resources in urban settings. Nancy served on many regional and national boards including the American Telehealth Association, Northwest Regional Telehealth Resource Cen-ter, Mid-Valley Hospital, and Greater Spokane Incorporated’s Health Industry Development Group. Nancy became Inland’s CAO and a member of the Providence Health Care Senior Leadership Team in 2015. In addition to her role at Inland, Nancy has served as interim Executive Director of the Spokane Teaching Health Clinic, a collabora-tion with Empire Health Foundation, Provi-dence Health Care, and Washington State University. The goal of this partnership is to improve regional access to health care by in-creasing the number of medical residencies in the area. I am pleased that she will continue in this role after her retirement from Inland. Mr. Speaker, Nancy is a tremendous asset to the Spokane community, Eastern Wash-ington, and Inland Northwest. Her years of dedication and work have touched the lives of countless people in many positive ways. I look forward to her continued friendship and lead-ership to expand access to health care through her role at the Spokane Teaching Health Clinic.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE MITTERSILL PROJECT RIBBON CUTTING CEREMONY 
HON. ANN M. KUSTER 
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, December 20, 2016 Ms. KUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Cannon Mountain Ski Area for the completion of the Mittersill Improve-ment Project. The ribbon-cutting ceremony marks the con-clusion of a four-year project that has com-pletely upgraded an integral part of New Hampshire’s vibrant snow-sports economy into a world-class resort for both recreation and professional training. Included in the upgrades was a widening of the Taft trail, which is now the widest ski trail in New Hampshire, and fa-cilities upgrades that culminated in Mittersill being named a US Ski Team training venue. The project also increased snowmaking ca-pacity, improved public access, and made the resort a safer place to ski. The project has been made possible by a collaboration of partners including, Cannon Mountain, the Holderness School, the Fran-conia Ski Club, and the U.S. Ski and Snowboard Association, in addition to gen-erous contributions by many members of the ski and snowboard community. As co-chairwoman of the Congressional Ski and Snowboard Caucus, I am an advocate on behalf of the winter recreation industry, includ-ing the many professionals whose hard work develops and supports the beautiful resorts we have in New Hampshire. I look forward to con-tinuing to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support, develop, and pro-tect this industry. I am pleased to congratulate all who worked on this project for their valuable contribution to the Granite State. f 
IN RECOGNITION OF GINA ARGENTO 
HON. CAROLYN B. MALONEY 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, December 20, 2016 Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise in recognition of Gina Argento, who was honored for her achieve-ments as part of Women’s History Month. Ms. Argento is President of Broadway Stages, one of New York’s largest film, television, and music production facilities which is located in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. Ms. Argento and her brother, Tony, opened Broadway Stages in 1983, turning a rundown movie theatre into a sound stage. Over the past 32 years, Broadway Stages has ex-panded both its physical size and capabilities. Broadway Stages now has over half a million square feet of space with 38 state-of-the-art stages and support facilities. Offering full serv-ice film, television, photography and music production facilities, Broadway Stages has served an extensive list of hit movies and tele-vision shows including ‘‘The Good Wife,’’ ‘‘Blue Bloods,’’ ‘‘Mr. Robot,’’ ‘‘Madam Sec-retary,’’ ‘‘Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,’’ ‘‘Limit-less,’’ ‘‘Broad City,’’ ‘‘Unforgettable,’’ and ‘‘Master of None,’’ in addition to commercials, print and music videos. Broadway Stages has facilities in Brooklyn and Queens and is cur-rently in the process of building a 69 acre fa-cility in Staten Island. Under Ms. Argento’s leadership, Broadway Stages has exhibited an unparalleled commit-ment towards the local community in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. In addition to creating hundreds of local jobs, Broadway Stages helps neighboring residents, small businesses, and community-based organizations. Broad-way Stages has donated food, equipment, and additional resources to local soup kitchens, partnered with the McGolrick Park Neighbor-hood Alliance to clean up the beloved park lo-cated in the center of Greenpoint and hosted family-friendly neighborhood block parties dur-ing the summer. Most recently, Broadway Stages joined the television show ‘‘Blue Bloods’’ and CBS to give $25,000 to the fami-lies of NYPD officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu who were brutally murdered in Brooklyn. Ms. Argento is also committed to supporting young people. Broadway Stages provided new audio equipment to St. Stanislaus Kostka Catholic Academy, sponsored a 5 Boro Bas-ketball team for teens, created a ‘‘Green Science Week’’ at PS110, and partnered with community organizations to hold a local ‘‘Schoolfest’’ fair for students and their fami-lies. Broadway Stages also funded the SYS-TEM Teen Summer Program, which provides high school students the opportunity to partici-pate in hands-on activities focused on green technology, engineering, gardening, and com-munity service. Broadway Stages is an incredible commu-nity partner that is committed to building a strong and environmentally sustainable future. Under Ms. Argento’s leadership, Broadway Stages has become a model of the way pri-vate industry can champion energy sustain-ability and environmentally-sound community development. By installing 50,000 square feet of solar photovoltaic systems on the roofs of 7 of its sound stages, Broadway Stages cre-ated the world’s first solar powered sound stage and the largest private solar power in-stallation in New York State. The solar roofs have offset 30 percent of Broadway Stage’s annual electricity consumption. Broadway Stages also created an organic vegetable farm called ‘‘Eagle Street Rooftop,’’ located on top of a warehouse in Greenpoint. The 6,000 square foot rooftop farm features a variety of educational and volunteer programs and a farmer’s market during the growing season. Broadway Stages is also involved in cleaning up a Brownfield site at 359 Kingsland Avenue. Ms. Argento has worked with YMCA Greenpoint, Boy Scouts of America, Kings County Democratic Club, Greenpoint Chamber of Commerce, Solar One, and EWVIDCO, an advocacy organization for industrial busi-nesses in Greenpoint. Ms. Argento is a loving mother to her three sons, John, Anthony, and Paul. She and her husband, John Ciafone, make an incredible team. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the remarkable work of Gina Argento, a successful businesswoman, envi-ronmentalist, and fantastic neighbor.

IN RECOGNITION OF SABRA BRIERE AND HER YEARS OF DIS-TINGUISHED SERVICE ON BE-HALF OF THE CITY OF ANN ARBOR HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, December 20, 2016 Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ann Arbor City Council Member and Mayor Pro Tem Sabra Briere for her record of service on behalf of the Ann Arbor community. For over 40 years, Mrs. Briere has served Ann Arbor with distinction in a variety of elected positions as well as through her involvement with local advocacy groups. Mrs. Briere moved to Ann Arbor in 1973 and has been active in civic life over the years. She has been involved with the Ann Arbor and Washtenaw County Democratic parties, filling numerous positions from secretary to chair-woman of the Ann Arbor Democratic Party in the 1990s. In addition, Mrs. Briere has served as President of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Washtenaw County chapter and vol-unteered with the Huron River Watershed Council. In 2007, she was elected to the Ann Arbor City Council and has been an effective advocate for Ann Arbor’s residents in this ca-pacity. Throughout her public service career, Mrs. Briere has promoted responsible city planning by spearheading measures to en-courage better design and zoning in new building development. Additionally, she has supported strong environmental protections and public transportation initiatives that have contributed to the health and well-being of the community. Mrs. Briere’s service and dedication on be-half of the City of Ann Arbor and the sur-rounding community has resulted in a more livable city and better quality of life for its resi-dents. She has been a constant presence at City Council hearings and community events, and her extensive knowledge of the issues facing Ann Arbor has made her an invaluable member of local government. Mrs. Briere has championed common sense reforms that have made a real difference in the lives of Ann Arbor residents. Her knowledge and dedica-tion to the community will be missed. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Sabra Briere and her years of service to the Ann Arbor community as a member of the Ann Arbor City Council. Her work on behalf of Ann Arbor has been instru-mental in its growth and development.

IN RECOGNITION OF REVEREND ANN KANSFIELD 
HON. CAROLYN B. MALONEY 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, December 20, 2016 Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise in recognition of Rev. Ann Kansfield, FDNY Chaplain and Pastor at the Greenpoint Reformed Church in Brooklyn, who is being honored for her achievements as part of Women’s History Month. The Church holds a special place as part of the Greenpoint His-toric District. Under Rev. Kansfield’s leader-ship, the Church offers space for worship, is used by community groups like Alcoholics Anonymous and Nar-Anon, and has been fea-tured in several film productions. It is also known for its 12–step recovery groups, chil-dren’s music classes, and a hunger program that feeds over 300 people per week. Rev. Kansfield has loved and served the people of North Brooklyn ever since the Greenpoint Reformed Church called her to be their pastor in 2003. Prior to her arrival, demo-graphic shifts over the previous century had caused the once large Dutch Reformed con-gregation to dwindle to less than a dozen peo-ple. The remaining congregants believed that the church had a bright future in the commu-nity, and invited Rev. Kansfield to help revi-talize their ministry. With energy and hopeful-ness, she has succeeded beyond anyone’s fondest dreams, bringing new parishioners and their families to the church. Rev. Kansfield’s work at the church includes wor-ship, evangelism, theology, improving the church building, fundraising, as well as public and community relations. Much of Rev. Kansfield’s time is spent feed-ing the hungry. When an increasing number of people began coming to the church asking for food, the congregation began a soup kitchen and food pantry under Rev. Kansfield’s guid-ance in October 2007. Rev. Kansfield works with caring volunteers, colleagues, and donors to ensure that the soup kitchen and food pan-try are able to keep up with an unprecedented demand for emergency food. Today the soup kitchen regularly serves 90 people a day and hundreds more get food from the food pantry. Rev. Kansfield holds degrees from Colum-bia University (BA, with honors) and New Brunswick Theological Seminary (MDiv, summa cum laude). Before her ordination, she built car batteries on an assembly line for AC Delco and punched in stock trades for TD Waterhouse. Nevertheless, Rev. Kansfield be-lieves that a four-week long bartending course that she attended in college gave her the most useful skills in preparing to be a pastor. Rev. Kansfield is married to Rev. Jennifer Aull, who also officiates at Greenpoint Re-formed Church. They have a son, John, and a daughter, Grace. She is ordained in the United Church of Christ. In the spring of 2015, Rev. Kansfield was sworn in as an FDNY chaplain by Commissioner Daniel Nigro, ful-filling her lifelong dream. Rev. Kansfield is the first female and openly gay chaplain of the FDNY, and was voted the New York Times ‘‘New Yorker of the Year’’ in 2015. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the extraordinary work of Rev. Ann Kansfield and her unwavering dedication to her community. f

Phil was born in New Jersey and moved to South Florida at the age of three. He attended Chaminade High School in Fort Lauderdale and was awarded a Bachelor of Science de-gree in finance from Florida Atlantic Univer-sity’s (FAU) College of Business in 1969. Dur-ing college, Phil began to work at a Ford deal-ership in Pompano Beach. He was so suc-cessful he stayed after graduation, was given the opportunity to open a dealership, and never looked back. Phil went on to found Phil Smith Manage-ment, Inc., serving as President and CEO. He operated eleven automobile dealership loca-tions representing 25 franchises in Florida and North Carolina. His company employs 780 people. He never forgot where he came from or the people who worked for him, and started an annual college scholarship program for the children of his employees. Phil also served as the Co-Chair of the South Florida Super Bowl Host Committee and sat on the Boards of the Orange Bowl Committee and the Broward Workshop, a non-profit organization that represents the interests of 100 Broward businesses and professions. Because of his community involvement, Phil was awarded with the Florida Sun Sentinel Company’s 2013 Excalibur Award for Busi-ness Leader of the Year in Broward County. He always gave back and was well-known for his civic, charitable, and philanthropic in-volvement throughout South Florida. He was involved with a number of advocacy groups serving the public, including the Cystic Fibro-sis Foundation, the Humane Society of Broward County, the American Cancer Soci-ety, and the Make a Wish Foundation. His most recent donation was to Holy Cross Hos-pital—a gift of $7 million to fund state-of-the- art neurological care. Phil and his wife Susan also gave to his alma mater, and gifted Florida Atlantic Univer-sity $5 million to establish the Phil Smith Cen-ter for Free Enterprise. Supporting the stra-tegic plan of the College of Business, the Cen-ter will add chaired professorships, support re-search and educational programs for faculty members and students, and support distin-guished visiting faculty along with a lecture se-ries and other educational programs focused on the principles of free enterprise. After his diagnosis with ALS, Phil became more involved in efforts to fight this terrible disease. He worked with Holy Cross Hospital in South Florida to establish the Phil Smith ALS and Movement Disorders Clinic, which provides access to leading edge clinical trials and research through an expanded relation-ship with Massachusetts General Hospital. After an 18 month battle with ALS, Phil trag-ically passed away at the age of 70 last week. He is survived by his wife of 30 years Susan, his sister Judy, his daughter Shawn, son-in- law Charlie, and three grandchildren James, Kaelin, and Cali. Mr. Speaker, Phil was a dear friend and kind soul. He touched the lives of so many, and his philanthropic efforts in Florida will go on to touch the lives of many more. It is with a heavy heart that I rise today to honor his life and accomplishments, but most of all, to honor our friendship. He will be so dearly missed. IN RECOGNITION OF ALICJA WINNICKI

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, December 20, 2016 Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Cincinnati St. Xavier High School water polo team on their state cham-pionship win this fall 2016 season. With hard work and dedication, the Bomb-ers’ water polo team won their second con-secutive state championship, totaling three total state championship wins. But what makes this win truly meaningful is what the water polo team did with its win. This state championship was dedicated to a hero who cannot be with us here today. The St. X water polo team dedicated its hard earned win to Charles Keating IV, a Navy SEAL who died in May in Iraq while fighting ISIS and protecting all of us here at home. Mr. Keating’s father and grandfather were both outstanding swimmers and graduates of St. Xavier High School. St. Xavier’s dedication of its win in memory of Charles Keating exemplifies the spirit and strength of the St. X community and what it stands for. On behalf of all St. X alumni and friends, I congratulate the St. Xavier Water Polo team on incredibly hard work and dedication. You have certainly embodied what it means to be a part of the Long Blue Line. Go Bombers.

IN RECOGNITION OF EDDIE PALMIERI 
HON. CAROLYN B. MALONEY 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, December 20, 2016 Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Eddie Palmieri, a New Yorker, famed pianist and composer who has won nine Grammy Awards throughout his career. Mr. Palmieri has revolu-tionized Latin music, influenced many other musicians, and thrilled audiences with his unique sound. He is one of America’s best jazz musicians and an icon in the music indus-try. Mr. Palmieri was born in Harlem, New York to Puerto Rican immigrants on December 15, 1936. He was raised in the Bronx and learned to play the piano at an early age. Through his education in the city’s public school system, he was exposed to jazz. Mr. Palmieri was inspired to practice and perform publicly from watching his older broth-er, Charlie Palmieri, play with talented musi-cians. At the age of 11, Eddie Palmieri auditioned to perform classical piano at Car-negie Hall, and made his debut there in 1947. Mr. Palmieri’s professional career as a pian-ist took off as he played with various bands in the early 1950s including Eddie Forrester, Johnny Segui, and the popular Tito Rodriguez Orchestra. By late 1961, Eddie Palmieri start-ed his own band, Conjunto La Perfecta, which featured a unique instrumentation of trom-bones and flutes instead of trumpets. Mr. Palmieri also experimented with the fusion of jazz and Latin-style music, adding a bassist as

well as a vocalist. The unusual mixture be-came Palmieri’s signature sound. After La Perfecta disbanded, Eddie began a new group with his brother Charlie, as well as musicians Victor Venegas, Andy Gonzales, Bernard ‘‘Pretty’’ Purdie, and Ronnie Cuber. Developing a new style together, this group further blended traditional Latin music with Afro-Cuban influences. In 1974, Mr. Palmieri reached a career mile-stone with his release of The Sun of Latin Music. That year, he won his first Grammy Award, marking the first time that Latin music was recognized by the National Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences (NARAS). He won again the following year for Unfinished Master-piece (1974). Returning to Puerto Rico, Palmieri formed a band called the Eddie Palmieri Orchestra and recorded several Grammy-winning albums in-cluding Palo Pa’ Rumba (1984), Solito (1985), and La Verdad (1987). In 1988, the Smithso-nian Institution recorded two of Palmieri’s per-formances for its catalog at the National Mu-seum of American History in Washington, D.C. In 1993, Mr. Palmieri was appointed to the board of governors at the New York chapter of the National Association of Recording Arts & Sciences (NARAS). In 1995, he helped insti-tute the Latin/African-Caribbean Jazz category for the Grammys. Mr. Palmieri has received many awards throughout his career including the Alice Tully African Heritage Award from City College, the Harlem Renaissance Award, Yale University’s Chubb Fellowship, and the Lifetime Achieve-ment Award by the Latin Academy of Record-ing Arts and Sciences. In 2013, Eddie Palmieri was awarded the coveted Jazz Master award by the National Endowment of the Arts, the highest honor an American Jazz artist can re-ceive. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating the extraordinary career of the exceptionally talented musician, Eddie Palmieri.
