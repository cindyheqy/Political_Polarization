PRAYER Reverend Dr. Scott Wilson, Capitol Hill Presbyterian Church, Washington, D.C., offered the following prayer: Gracious and loving God, send Your spirit once again to these Halls of power, where so many have come to participate in the difficult but glorious process of governing by consent of the people. Be especially with those blessed with this awesome authority, that they may wield it with humility and grace. Amid the many voices of our world and our culture, may we strain to hear clearly a word from You, the One who desires justice and mercy.

To that end, Lord, be with those who are in their home districts, and grant them peace as they dialogue with their neighbors, whether they be friend or foe. Help us to be strengthened by the good we see in others. Help us seek a way that is pleasing to You. Amen.

PRAYER The PRESIDING OFFICER. Today’s opening prayer will be offered by our guest Chaplain, the Reverend Bruce Scott, pastor of Pentecostals of South Lake, from Merrillville, IN. The guest Chaplain offered the fol-lowing prayer: Let us pray. Precious Lord, Creator of the heav-ens and the Earth, and all that dwells therein, we honor You from a grateful heart, knowing all of our blessings that we enjoy every day come from You. Heavenly Father, as the Senators as-semble in this Chamber today, let them come together in unity to build a stronger and better America. Thank You for their dedication and commit-ment, as they labor together with You for what is right and acceptable in Your sight. This Nation was founded on biblical principles. Lord, I pray that You would grant to them wisdom to make right decisions. The Old Testa-ment prophet declares it is not by might, nor by power but by My Spirit, saith the Lord. Bless their families at home with peace and safety. Lord, bless our military all over this world. Just as You paid the ultimate price for our freedom on Calvary, our brave military men and women are willing to give their all so we may live in freedom today. Strengthen and en-courage each family as they wait for the safe return of their loved one. Bless and protect our first responders, police, fire, and EMS personnel. It is true that God has shed His Grace on us. Lord, surround this Chamber with Your presence. We pray in Jesus’s Name. Amen. PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The Presiding Officer led the Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Repub-lic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f

f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-pore. The majority leader is recog-nized. 
f 
NOMINATION OF ROBERT LIGHTHIZER Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, today the Senate will take a cloture vote on the U.S. Trade Representative nominee, Robert Lighthizer. We know the task before Mr. Lighthizer is an important one. I appreciate his willing-ness to take on this challenge, and I look forward to working with the ad-ministration on pro-growth trade poli-cies moving forward. CONGRESSIONAL REVIEW ACT RESOLUTIONS Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, over the past 8 years, the American people struggled in an economy that too often failed to meet its potential. Many struggled to pay bills. Many struggled to make the mortgage. Too many couldn’t find a job at all. Yet, time after time, when Ameri-cans looked to the Obama administra-tion, they got tired leftwing ideology instead of serious solutions. When Americans asked for policies that would allow the economy to grow again, the Obama administration gave them just the opposite: a highly ag-gressive regulatory rampage that sometimes veered outside congres-sional authority, that often hurt the economy and job creation even more, that nearly always empowered unac-countable Washington bureaucrats at the expense of the American people. Of course, not all regulations are bad regulations. Many are necessary and even beneficial, but what the Obama administration seemed to forget in its fit of ideological pique is this key point: Regulations are not issued in a vacuum. They can harm the middle class. They can kill jobs. They can raise prices. They can depress wages. They can reduce opportunity. No matter how well-intentioned, reg-ulations can have undesirable, often unexpected, impacts—and in this regu-latory avalanche of the last 8 years, we saw another example of the con-sequences of putting leftwing ideology over the lives of real people. It is one reason why Americans de-cided to go in a pro-growth direction last November. They elected a new President who, as one of his first acts, ordered the elimination of at least two existing regulations for every new one issued. He called for a regulatory budg-et to cap regulatory costs. He and his administration took a number of ac-tions that are already helping to turn the regulatory tide back in favor of growth and jobs.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES2892 May 11, 2017 
The American people also reelected a Republican Congress that wasted no time in providing regulatory relief to Americans and restoring legislative power where it rightfully belongs, with the people through their elected rep-resentatives right here in Congress. We have a tool that has proved in-credibly helpful in this regard. It is called the Congressional Review Act. It is the brainchild of a bipartisan group of legislators, including former Demo-cratic Leader Harry Reid, and what it allows Congress to do is overturn regu-lations issued over the last 60 days with a simple majority vote. From its inception in 1996 until this February, it had only been used suc-cessfully one time. From February until today, it has been used success-fully 13 times—with the 14th soon to be signed into law; namely, to overturn a number of Obama administration regu-lations rushed through at the last minute. Getting this done hasn’t always been easy, and we have met a lot of obstruc-tion along the way. Although the Democrats once championed the CRA, a tool that is ‘‘fair’’ in the words of former Leader Reid, our current Demo-cratic colleagues seem to take a very different view. They have fought against our efforts to deliver relief to the American people, just as they have blocked and punted and forced unneces-sary procedural hurdles on the Presi-dent’s nominees for months, and that, remember, was mostly for the sake of unnecessarily taking up valuable floor time, knowing full well it would not change the end result. Regardless, de-spite those obstructionist tactics, we have continued our regulatory relief ef-forts because we knew it could make a positive difference for our country. This congressional action we have taken already, in coordination with key administration actions, is esti-mated to result in more than $67 bil-lion in regulatory cost savings. Let me say that again. The actions we have taken so far, coupled with key adminis-trative actions they have taken on their own, result in more than $67 bil-lion in regulatory cost-savings and about 56 million hours’ worth of paper-work reductions. The New York Times says the efforts we have undertaken represent ‘‘a his-toric reversal of government rules in record time.’’ A historic reversal of government rules in record time. The Washington Post proclaimed it ‘‘the most ambitious regulatory rollback since Reagan.’’ Politico calls it ‘‘a once-in-a-generation opportunity,’’ and that is exactly right. In just a few short months, we have turned a significant corner from how things operated under the Obama ad-ministration. Instead of going around Congress to push through regulations, the President is working with us to ease the burden. Instead of adding even more redtape to the Federal Register, we are breaking through it. Instead of promoting policies that hinder growth, we are pursuing ones that actually en-courage it. The actions we have taken can ben-efit the American people in a number of meaningful ways: Like hard-working families saving for retirement—we made sure Obama-era regulations wouldn’t stand in their way. Like stu-dents who want to receive the best edu-cation they can—we made sure Obama- era regulations wouldn’t hold them back either. After 8 years of an administration which punished coal miners and their families for simply working hard to make a living, we are finally working hand-in-glove with an administration that wants to help mining families in-stead. Here is an example of what I mean. In the Republican administration, President Trump used Executive action to order a review of Obama-era regula-tions that attempted to close existing coal plants and prevent future ones from ever, ever being built. In the Re-publican Congress, we used the CRA to overturn an Obama administration rule which would have put as many as one- third of coal mining jobs at risk. Together, Congress and the Trump administration are taking decisive ac-tion to support jobs in domestic energy and coal communities. As we do so, we have seen encouraging news as well. According to one report, Kentucky saw a slight, slight increase in coal produc-tion last quarter, and Federal projec-tions predict that national production will continue to increase over the next few years. I was pleased to see that news. It is a trend we would like to see continue. I will keep working with the administration and my colleagues in Congress to continue to protect Ken-tucky jobs and Kentucky families. These examples, and others, offer yet another illustration of how we can make meaningful and positive impacts in the lives of the people we represent. Look, we know there is a lot more to be done. We know the scale of the chal-lenge. The growth of the regulatory state has taken a substantial toll on our economy, one that can’t be rem-edied overnight. A recent Washington Post column cited studies saying that ‘‘the costs of complying with federal rules and regulations totaled nearly $1.9 trillion in 2015, equal to about half the federal budget’’—$1.9 trillion in 2015—and that regulations may have shrunk our annual growth rate by as much as 0.8 percent. These regulations may well have shrunk our growth rate by 0.8 percent. As the column pointed out, ‘‘A main rap against the adminis-trative state is that, through its ag-gressive growth, the executive branch has usurped power from other parts of the government, mainly Congress.’’ With the action we have taken with the CRA, that is beginning to change. Indeed, one reason the Congressional Review Act is so important is because it helps Congress serve as a check and balance on the executive branch. As three former Senators, including former Leader Reid, put it, the Con-gressional Review Act can help ‘‘re-dress the balance [between the execu-tive and legislative branches], reclaim-ing for Congress some of its policy-making authority.’’ While we can’t simply turn back time or completely erase the negative im-pact that Obama regulations have had already, the CRA has allowed us to stop a number of them in their tracks while also preventing agencies from creating similarly harmful rules in the future. A lot of time and a lot of effort has gone into seeing these resolutions across the finish line so I thank each of our colleagues who had a hand in that effort. Specifically, I recognize those who introduced these resolutions or the Senate companion of House CRA resolutions. I thank: Senator I
NHOFE ; Senator G

Because of their ef-forts and key actions by the Trump ad-ministration, we have begun chipping away at policies that have hurt the middle class and prevented economic growth for far too long. Much work re-mains to be done, but we are going to keep working together to help our economy fully recover from 8 years of anti-growth regulatory overreach, 8 years of missed opportunities, 8 years of dreams deferred, and 8 years of gov-ernment that left far too many behind.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2893 May 11, 2017 
last few days. The President of the United States fired the man in charge of an active investigation about the President and his campaign ties to Russia. The truth is, the dismissal of Director Comey is part of a much longer pattern of this administration’s interfering with or removing the people who are in a position to conduct an independent investigation of the Presi-dent and his administration. The administration requested that the chairmen of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees help them beat back reports in the press about the Russia probe. The administration picked this Attorney General—a very close political ally, then-Senator Jeff Sessions—to lead a Justice Department that was supposed to independently conduct this investigation. Attorney General Sessions, of course, has since had to recuse himself from the Russia investigation after he mis-led Congress about his meetings with the Russian Ambassador. The administration is not shy about removing independent prosecutors and law enforcement officers from their posts if they are simply doing some-thing the President doesn’t like, even if it is required by law. They fired Sally Yates. They fired Preet Bharara. They fired more than 40 U.S. attorneys across the country. Now they have fired Director Comey. This is about more than just Mr. Comey. This is about a pattern of events that casts tremendous doubt on whether this administration has any interest in allowing the Russia inves-tigation or any other investigation that could be politically damaging to them to proceed unimpeded. This is about one of the most sacred things we believe in as Americans, the rule of law—the rule of law being threatened here. We in Congress, in both parties, should have one overarching goal: to get the full unvarnished truth. That means getting to the bottom of the events that led to Mr. Comey’s dis-missal and making sure the Russia in-vestigation is conducted impartially. Here in Congress, the Senate Intel-ligence Committee is doing its inves-tigation in a bipartisan way, but the executive branch investigation has been compromised. Attorney General Sessions, who had to recuse himself from the Russia in-vestigation, played a significant role in firing the man who was leading it. Not only that, but the Attorney General is now reportedly leading a search to re-place Mr. Comey. He is helping select the next FBI Director, who will be in charge of an investigation he cannot oversee—what an irony. This Attorney General shouldn’t be anywhere near the hiring process of the next FBI Director. His role will jaun-dice the entire process, if it hasn’t al-ready. In order to ensure the American peo-ple can have faith in the impartiality of the investigation, it must be con-ducted far from the reach of the White House. It is the overwhelming view of my caucus that a special prosecutor should now be appointed to conduct the investigation into the Trump cam-paign’s ties to Russia. This special prosecutor should be ap-pointed by the highest ranking civil servant at the Justice Department. Mr. Rosenstein and other political ap-pointees should not be the ones who de-cide on a special prosecutor, lest that decision be seen as influenced, or worse, made at the direction of the ad-ministration. I thank my colleague from California, Senator F
EINSTEIN , for speaking so eloquently on this pro-posal. In addition, there are several things that should happen here on Capitol Hill that will help get us to the bottom of the events this week. First, Mr. Comey should testify be-fore Congress. There are so many ques-tions that only Mr. Comey can answer. So I applaud Senators B
URRand W AR-
NER for inviting him to appear before the Intelligence Committee next week. It was the right thing to do. We ought to hear from Mr. Comey, and I urge Mr. Comey to come and tell the whole story. Second, Attorney General Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rosen-stein should make themselves avail-able to Congress. I am renewing my re-quest of the majority leader to call an all-Senators briefing where they can answer the questions swirling about from Tuesday night’s firing. Attorney General Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein should appear sepa-rately and partially in a classified set-ting if necessary, but they must come. Mr. Rosenstein has played a central role in all of these events. He could help clear up questions about where the decision to fire Mr. Comey origi-nated. So later today, separate and apart from my request that he come before the Senate, I will be sending Mr. Rosenstein a letter with a list of ques-tions for him to answer publicly. Amer-ica needs to hear them. Many Demo-crats voted for Mr. Rosenstein a few weeks ago because he had a reputation for integrity. He assured us he would be an independent force inside the De-partment of Justice, and 94 Senators voted for him, but the events of last week have made many of us question that belief. He owes it to the Senate. He owes it to the people he supervises in the Justice Department and in the FBI, and he owes it to the American people to provide some answers. In sum, we demand the appointment of a special prosecutor by a non-political appointee at the Department of Justice. We want to hear from Mr. Comey. We are asking the majority leader to hold separate all-Senators briefings with the Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General. This would help us get a hold on what hap-pened, would explain why, and would help guide us in what to do next be-cause this investigation will not die no matter who wants it to. I sincerely hope we will get an answer from the majority leader by the end of the day. This is a very serious matter. Right now, there are two different stories coming out of the White House. Some are saying the decision to fire Mr. Comey came directly from the White House; others, including the Vice President, have said it came from the Department of Justice—specifi-cally, Mr. Rosenstein and Mr. Sessions. We need to resolve these two story lines on something as important as this. We need the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. So I hope my Republican colleagues see the wisdom and value in our request and respond appropriately by the end of the day. f 
CONGRESSIONAL REVIEW ACT RESOLUTIONS Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, just a word on the majority’s use of the Con-gressional Review Act. The window for using the CRA is closing this week. I heard the majority leader touting the 13 CRAs the majority passed this year. I want to make two points. First, despite what the majority leader and the President claim, these CRAs are not a huge accomplishment. They simply overturned rules passed at the very end of the Obama administra-tion. They hardly constitute a legisla-tive agenda. In fact, the use of the CRA shows just how little this majority and this President have been able to ac-complish in the first 100-plus days. The fact that they are bragging about these highlights how little else they have ac-complished legislatively. Second, the CRAs are designed to help special interests against the inter-ests of working Americans, belying all the promises President Trump made when he campaigned. Let me give some examples. One of them is on foreign oil bribery. One of them is on a retirement rule. One of them is on stream protec-tions. One is on mentally-ill access to guns. In each of these, it is a narrow special interest who pushed it, not a demand from the American people. Which Americans say ‘‘Make it OK for our companies to bribe foreign oil com-panies or pollute our streams’’ or ‘‘Give the mentally ill access to guns’’? These are narrow interests in each case. Let’s be very clear about this. The CRAs Republicans passed are not roll-ing back burdensome regulations. Oh, no. They are giveaways to Big Oil, Big Gas, Big Coal, Big Mining, and wealthy special interests. The most indefensible one of many is the one on a retirement rule. If local-ities or States want to set up systems whereby working people want to put money away for their retirement, why not? It doesn’t hurt anybody. It doesn’t require anybody to do anything. And these days where fewer and fewer Americans have pensions from their companies, it is what is needed. But

some banks didn’t want competition. They didn’t want it shown that maybe the cities or the States could run these retirement systems more cheaply and take less money out of the average American’s pocket. So we undid this rule. I don’t think a single average con-stituent in any part of America wanted this rule undone, just the big banks— some of them, not all of them. That is the kind of thing my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and President Trump are bragging about. It is noth-ing to brag about. Let’s be very clear about this. These are not the priorities the American people voted for in November, where a substantial majority of Americans said in exit polls that the economy was rigged against them. These CRAs rig the game even further for the wealthy special interests and are nothing to brag about or write home about. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, over the past few months, Congress has passed 14 different resolutions that are going to save the American people money and are going to make it a lot easier for our economy to grow. There have been 14 times since February that we have struck down unnecessary, bur-densome, and costly regulations. These were called ‘‘midnight regula-tions’’ because they came at the end of the Obama administration. Some came out, actually, after the Presidential election had been completed. The out-come was known, and, still, the out-going administration tried to continue with what President Obama’s Chief of Staff at one time called ‘‘audacious ex-ecutive actions.’’ Half of these 14 regu-lations—half of them—were actually put in place after the November Presi-dential election. When one thinks about the election last year in November, President Obama said time and again during the campaign that his agenda was on the ballot. The American people rejected that agenda, and the President dumped these new rules on the American people as a parting shot. We wiped out 14 of these regulations—wiped them off the books. In one resolution, we rolled back an important part of President Obama’s war on coal. That was the so-called stream buffer rule. It was designed to shut down a lot of the surface coal mining in this country. It would have destroyed up to one-third of coal min-ing jobs in America. So we passed a resolution that will protect coal min-ing jobs and protect American energy independence. There was another resolution we passed that restores the role of local land managers in deciding how best to use Federal land. Before the Obama ad-ministration, the local experts were the ones who would help decide how Federal land could be used in so many areas around the country. These are the people on the ground. They are the ones who know best what works there. They are the ones with the best sense of how to balance all of the different ways that land can be used. That could be things like recreation, energy pro-duction, and grazing. Well, the Obama administration said it wasn’t interested in hearing from the local experts anymore. It decided to put the decisions—all of those deci-sions—in the hands of unelected, unac-countable bureaucrats in Washington, DC. So Congress passed a resolution that says these are decisions that af-fect local communities and those com-munities should have the say—and a significant amount of say—in how deci-sions get made. When we look at these 14 resolutions all together, they will save Americans over $4 billion and more than 4 million hours of paperwork because not only are the regulations expensive, they are burdensome and time-consuming.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2895 May 11, 2017 
I can tell my colleagues this is just the beginning. These resolutions are just one tool that we have to strike down bad regulations. There is much more that Congress can do and will do, and there is much more that the Trump administration can do. The administration has already made it clear that the bureaucrats in Wash-ington are not in charge anymore. I plan to make sure the Trump adminis-tration keeps up the pace and tosses some of the worst regulations and rules into the garbage where they belong. A good place to start would be for Ryan Zinke, the Secretary of the Inte-rior, to throw out another rule that makes it more difficult to produce American energy. This regulation sup-posedly tries to reduce how much methane gets lost in oil and gas pro-duction. There is always some unproc-essed natural gas that gets released at gas and oil wells. Energy producers try to gather up this gas and then ship it to a processing plant where, of course, it can be sold. It can be used by cus-tomers, and taxes are paid on it that go to State and local governments, as well as money that is raised by the sales for the companies themselves. To do that, the producers need small pipelines. They need these small pipe-lines to collect the unprocessed gas from the wells and to get it to the processing plant. Here is the problem: We don’t have enough of these gath-ering lines. Without the gathering lines, the only option is for that gas to get burned, and that extra natural gas will escape into the air. So what do the bureaucrats in Wash-ington say? They could have addressed the real reason this gas is being lost; that is, the fact that they haven’t al-lowed enough of these gathering lines on Federal land. Instead, they decided to write a regulation that makes it tougher for us to produce American en-ergy here in America. The Obama ad-ministration blocked the permits to build the gathering lines. So this methane rule is a terrible regulation. It is redundant. It is unnec-essary. I believe it is illegal, and it needs to go. Secretary Zinke should wipe the slate clean and get rid of this outrageous rule immediately. He should also order the bureaucrats who work for him to start approving more of these gas-gathering lines. That is what we really need. We need to make energy as clean as we can, as fast as we can, and do it in ways that do not raise costs for American families. We need to balance thoughtful regulation with a growing economy. We can have both. The Obama administration abso-lutely failed to strike the right bal-ance. The Trump administration and Congress have a lot more we can do to make sure we get the balance right. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from North Carolina. Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, I will be brief. I think the Senator from Okla-homa is going to go into some addi-tional details, and the Senator from Wyoming did a great job of summa-rizing some of the positive results that have come from our actions. I want to refer to his resolutions of disapproval for regulations that we feel were an overreach. When we went through the 14 votes— we actually had 15, but we were not able to succeed in 1 last regulation of disapproval yesterday—there were ar-guments put forth against our dis-approving these regulations. It was as if we were completely deregulating the subject matter area that we were fo-cused on, but that was not the case. What we were trying to do is eliminate the duplication and the costs associ-ated with layering regulations on top of regulations. We have a lot of discussion around here about tax reform, and we need to do that, but if we look at the regu-latory burden on businesses and home-owners and State and local govern-ments, there is a smart, right-size way to implement regulations, and there is a costly, complex, wrong way to imple-ment regulations. So I am proud we were able to get 14 resolutions of disapproval completed. I think they were regulations that were not necessary. They are obviously areas that if Congress ever needed to act, we could go back and implement regulations, if necessary. What we ended up doing through this action over the past couple of months with the administration is reduce regu-latory burdens by $67 billion, and we have eliminated some 56 million paper-work hours. We are eliminating, we are cutting redtape, and that is a good thing. I appreciate all the Members who worked hard on getting this together. I particularly appreciate my staff—Bill Bode and Torie Ness in particular—who worked hard with the other Senate of-fices to see what kind of support we could get for moving these regulatory disapprovals forward. I thank my fel-low Members and the administration for working with us to fulfill our prom-ise, which is to right-size government and get our economy going again. With that, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Oklahoma. Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of all, I appreciate the comments made by my colleague from North Carolina. It is even more meaningful to me because all during the time the regulations were coming on, I happened to be the one who was chairing the Environment and Public Works Committee, and we knew what was going to happen. I am almost speechless when I think about the success. We went 20 years only taking up 1 CRA, and then we end up passing 14 of them—all but 1. That is a huge, successful record. My col-leagues understand, this gives us the opportunity for people who are answer-able to the public—people who are elected and have to stand for elec-tions—to have a part in what is some-times considered to be the action of an unelected bureaucrat. We have had great opportunities here. I think the ‘‘midnight’’ regula-tions—a term that is used quite often— so that a party going out of office, such as President Obama, being very lib-eral—a very proud liberal, I might add—wanted to get as many of his rules in at the last minute. We were able to come in and pass these in the time required. We were able to pass 14 of these, in addition to the other regu-lations and other methods of doing reg-ulations, which I want to address a lit-tle bit. It is just not something that we really anticipated would happen. Now, I am particularly proud because mine was the first CRA to be passed in 20 years, and that was the very first one that came from what President Obama wanted having to do with the oil and gas industry, but the fact that nothing passed in that long period of time just shows now that people are recognizing that we who stand for elec-tion should be involved in this process of doing away with these regulations. Now, the rule that I brought to the floor, which was the first one the Presi-dent signed—we had a great signing ceremony and I enjoyed it very much— was the one that affected the oil and gas industry. It was an SEC ruling of the Obama administration that said that if you are a domestic producer of oil and gas—of course, that is the pri-vate sector—you have to release all of the information you are using in pro-ducing a bid against maybe another country. To use an example, in China, it is not in the private sector like it is in the United States. Their oil and gas business is in the public sector so they would have a distinct advantage. Quite frankly, it is consistent with what the previous President—President Obama— was doing in his war on fossil fuels. Fossil fuels are coal, oil, and gas, and he was very proud to be opposed to coal, oil, and gas, and frankly nuclear too. I have often wondered—I go back to Oklahoma virtually every weekend that I don’t have to be in one of the war zones or someplace like that. I go there really for my therapy because they ask questions that make sense. We don’t get these questions in Wash-ington. One of them I remember was in Shattuck, OK. When I was there, some-body said: Explain this to me. We have a President who wants to do away with fossil fuels and he wants to do away with nuclear energy. Now, we are de-pendent upon fossil fuels, coal, oil and gas, and nuclear energy for 89 percent of the power it takes to run this ma-chine called America. If he is success-ful in doing away with it, how do we run this machine called America? Well, I am proud to say that the war against fossil fuels is over.

the banking business or the financial services business, they are concerned about the overregulation that comes from Dodd-Frank. If they are farmers, they are concerned about the regula-tion that would take the jurisdiction of regulating our water resources out of the States and putting it in the Fed-eral Government. So that is what this is all about. So I will tell you how serious this was. The CRA that I had was so signifi-cant that the Federal courts came in, in July of 2013, and said that the SEC made several errors in rushing this reg-ulation through. They actually vacated the rule. That was a major accomplish-ment. I was very proud that I had the courts on my side, for a change. Anyway, the SEC finalized the sec-ond rule under the authority of Dodd- Frank, section 1504, by making some— without any really substantial changes. Nonetheless, this is the one that he first signed. So thanks to the Congressional Re-view Act, oil and gas companies are not at a disadvantage when they are com-peting with State-owned oil and gas companies such as we have in China. We passed other critical CRAs be-cause regulations tied the hands of our businesses and took local control away from the States. A lot of people in America—and I think a higher percent-age of my people in Oklahoma—are really concerned about Second Amend-ment rights. Of course, we had one of the regulations that went through—in fact, Second Amendment rights, when we talk about the farmers and the ranchers and not just from my State of Oklahoma—we are a farm State—but throughout America, they will tell you that there are problems. Their No. 1 concern was—and I asked the Farm Bu-reau representative. He said the great-est problem facing farmers is not any-thing that is found in the ag bill, it is the overregulation by the EPA and spe-cifically what they call the WOTUS bill. The WOTUS bill, which is the one I just mentioned, would take the juris-diction away from the State and give it to the Federal Government. I have to say this. When you talk about ‘‘liberals,’’ that is not a negative term. It is a reality. It is how much power should be in the hands of the Federal bureaucrats as opposed to indi-viduals and the States. So we have a lot of these regulations. One of the things the CRA has done is, it has taken away an excuse that people will use—I am talking about people in this Chamber who are legitimately liberals and believe we should have more con-trol in Washington—it takes the power away from the Federal bureaucrats be-cause what they can do is go ahead and pass the regulations. Then you go back home and when people are yelling and screaming about being overregulated back in their home States, they say: Don’t blame me, blame the unelected bureaucrats. A CRA takes away that excuse because it forces them to actu-ally get on record. So as chairman of the Senate Com-mittee on Environment and Public Works, we were involved with more of these regulations than any other com-mittee because that is what we do for a living there. So I was very happy to see all of the successes we had. Let me just mention because I don’t think it has been mentioned before— and I will submit this for the R
ECORD . There are two ways of doing away with these regulations, and one is through Executive orders. I think everybody knows that. But they don’t realize what has already been done. I think we have had a total of 30, 31 regulations that have been done away with either through Executive orders or through the Congressional Review Act. Some of the Executive orders, for example, are the WOTUS, the one we have been talk-ing about; clean energy, something which repeals the Clean Power Plan and something which officially ended the war on fossil fuels, I might add; the Executive order on rebuilding the mili-tary; the Executive order on the Key-stone and Dakota Access Pipelines—we are all familiar with that and the ongo-ing debate. Some of the CRAs really aren’t talked about too much, and we are talking about regulations that came from the Obama administration that now have been done away with through use of CRAs—the educational rule mandating Federal standards for evalu-ating teacher performance; the edu-cational rule establishing a national school board, with an effort to get away from local control of the schools; the Interior rule that blocked Alaska from controlling their own hunting and fishing in that beautiful State; the So-cial Security rule that put seniors on a gun ban list—Second Amendment rights. All of these things are very signifi-cant, and I am very proud, quite frank-ly, of this body. With the exception of one, we passed all 14 of the CRAs, and I can’t think of any time that has been done in the past. So it is a great thing. It did put the power back in the hands of the people who are elected here, and I am very glad to have been a partici-pant in that. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-sent that the complete list of the Con-gressional Review Act resolutions passed and the Trump Executive ac-tions be printed in the R

MENTAL HEALTH  
Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, I want to talk today about a topic that

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2897 May 11, 2017 
I think is getting more attention now than it has gotten for some time—but still not the attention it deserves—and that is to talk a little bit in May, which is Mental Health Month, about mental health. I was on the floor of the Senate the last day of October 2013, the 50th anni-versary of the last bill that President Kennedy signed into law, which was the Community Mental Health Act. Through the Community Mental Health Act, you saw the facilities that were about to be closed, but the antici-pated alternatives, in so many ways, never really developed. According to the National Alliance on Mental Ill-ness, approximately one in five adults experiences mental illness in a given year, and one in five young people be-tween the ages of 13 and 18 will experi-ence severe mental illness sometime during their lifetime. The National Institutes of Health says that one in four adult Americans has a diagnosable, and almost always treatable, mental health disorder, a mental behavioral health issue, and that one in nine adult Americans has behavioral health illness that impacts how they live every single day. So whether it is the statistic that relates to one in four or one in five or one in nine, this is an issue that affects the lives of lots of people. Half of the children in that age group, 13 to 18, rarely get the help they need, and even fewer adults do. About 40 percent of adults who have behav-ioral health issues receive the treat-ment they need for that issue. I think we are beginning to make great strides on this. Certainly, the discussion has changed. The opportunity to treat mental health like all other health has changed. In the 113th Congress, just a few years ago, Senator S
TABENOW from Michigan and I worked to get a bill passed; it was called the Excellence in Mental Health Act, and we now have eight States that have projects going on. In those eight States—in signifi-cant areas of all of those States—be-havioral health is being treated like all other health. The idea is really built on the feder-ally qualified health centers idea, the reimbursement model, where anybody can go, and if you are covered by a gov-ernment program, that is taken into consideration. If you are covered by private insurance, that is taken into consideration. If you are paying cash, there is a significant and rapidly de-clining amount of cash that you have to pay because your income gets small-er. But everybody in these States would have access to mental health care, just as they currently have access to other kinds of healthcare. At the community mental health centers that meet 24/7 standards, that are available, that have the staffing needs, and in other places that have the staff the law requires and the ac-cess the law requires, people can go to those facilities, and those providers will know they are going to be reim-bursed for treating mental health like all other health. I am certainly glad that my State of Missouri is one of the eight pilot States in that demonstration program. In our State, we have been—I think by any standard—forward-leaning on this issue for a long time, but not nearly as forward-leaning as we should be or as people who look at the pervasive char-acter of behavioral health issues under-stand we should be. When we passed the bill a couple of years ago, we really weren’t sure how much interest we would get from States. There was some sense that, well, eight States would be all the States that would even want to do this, if every State that wanted to apply and could go through the application proc-ess did so. But, in fact, everybody in the mental health world was encour-aged to see 24 States, which rep-resented half of the population in the country, apply to be part of that pilot program—certainly, leading by exam-ple here, figuring out what happens. Frankly, if you treat behavioral health like all other health, I think what many of these States will find— and they may all find—is that the other health costs are much more eas-ily dealt with and, obviously, that not only is treating behavioral health like all other health the right thing to do, but it actually may save money to spend this money. People who have other health problems but who are see-ing their doctor because their behav-ioral health issue is under control may be seeing two doctors. They are taking the medicine they need for behavioral health—if they need medicine for that—but because they are eating bet-ter, sleeping better, feeling better about themselves, they are also taking the medicine and getting to the ap-pointments for any other health issue they have. Early studies indicate that, actually, you save money by doing the right thing and understanding that mental health isn’t a topic we don’t talk about, but mental health is just an-other health issue we need to deal with. We need to be sure that we have pro-viders going forward. We don’t have enough doctors in Missouri—or in other States—who are able to treat the increasing number of people who seek treatment. And as doctors retire in these fields, we are going to have an even greater shortage if we don’t do something to encourage people to go into this field. There is a particular shortage in care providers who deal with children. Chil-dren and youth who are in need of men-tal health services and who don’t re-ceive them run a greater risk of all kinds of other problems, including dropping out of school, not doing well in school, ending up in the criminal justice system—things that needlessly happen because we haven’t stepped for-ward and viewed their behavioral health problem as we would if they had some other problems. I was glad Senator REEDfrom Rhode Island and I were recently able to re-introduce a bill called the Ensuring Children’s Access to Specialty Care Act. Pediatric medicine doesn’t pay as well as other medicine for lots of rea-sons. One is that children don’t have a lot of their own money to pay with, and often their parents don’t have it ei-ther. This bill that Senator R
EEDand I in-troduced would allow physicians who want to specialize in, among other things, child and adolescent psychiatry to be eligible for the National Health Service Corps student loan repayment program. That program is generally not available now to doctors who go on and specialize on the theory that if you specialize, you are going to have more income than the general practice doc-tor might have. Those programs have always been focused on the general practice doctor, but if you specialize in children’s health—whether it is, frank-ly, psychiatry or any other area of children’s health—you are much less likely to financially benefit from de-ciding to do that. So this would allow those doctors to pursue that program as part of how they help get their loans paid back. Whether it is physical or behavioral health, children have a unique set of health needs and often a lack of ability on their own to do what needs to be done. Medical residents who practice pediatric medicine require additional training. One of the barriers they cite for not getting that additional training is that they are going to have to have these additional student loans. Hope-fully, we can allow ways for them to get into programs that other doctors get into, to see that they continue to be encouraged to be part of pediatric medicine and pediatric specialties. Also, we are looking at another bill, the Advancing Care for Exceptional Kids Act, commonly referred to as ACE Kids. What ACE Kids does is treat kids who have serious medical problems as exactly that—to have a way to look at health needs and medically complex kids whom you wouldn’t look at other-wise, seeing that these particular pa-tients don’t have to go through all kinds of barriers to find a doctor, fee for service. Medically complex kids really need help, and I think we could easily design a new and different way to deal with them. Finally, talking about kids, I want to say one other thing, and that is just to mention that this particular week is Teacher Appreciation Week. I was a teacher after I got out of college, be-fore I had a chance later to be a univer-sity president. I think teachers are al-ways inclined to be teachers and try to tell the stories we need to hear. But when we are talking about mental health and teachers, healthcare, men-tal health, first aid are things that don’t allow teachers to become child psychiatrists or mental health profes-sionals but do allow teachers, as they

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES2898 May 11, 2017 
are watching the students whom they get to know so well, to identify what students need help and what students don’t. Often teachers get the first chance outside the child’s home to see that they are clearly challenged or may be challenged in ways that are easily dealt with, if they are dealt with, and are really troublesome if they are not dealt with at all. So while we celebrate Teacher Appre-ciation Week at the very end of school and Mental Health Month, I hope we commit ourselves to look at these mental health issues for what they are. They are health issues. They need to be talked about. The right thing to do is to deal with them. I think we are seeing new and better things happen there, but we are not nearly where we should be yet. As I said earlier, when Senator S
TABENOW  and I could go to the Floor on the 50th anniversary of the last bill President Kennedy signed and 50 years later talk about how few of the goals set in that bill have been met in five decades by society, we really have a lot of catch-ing up to do. I believe and hope we are catching up, and I hope this is a month where people really think about telemedicine, contacts, opportunities, and excellence in mental health in ways we haven’t before. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The as-sistant Democratic leader. 
MEDICAL RESEARCH  
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, be-fore the Senator from Missouri leaves the floor, I want to say a word about him and the topic he raised today about health and, in this particular case, children. Senator B
LUNT and I have adjoining States, Illinois and Missouri. We have joined up, as well, on the issue of med-ical research. I salute him. Even though he is my Republican colleague, I want to make clear that this is a bi-partisan issue. He has made it a bipar-tisan issue. We had the good support of Senator A
LEXANDER , Republican of Tennessee, and Senator M
URRAY , Dem-ocrat of Washington. The Senator from Missouri has done some amazing things. I want to say specifically for the Record that Amer-ica owes him a debt of gratitude, as chairman of the Appropriations Sub-committee that is responsible for the National Institutes of Health, the fore-most leading medical research agency in the world. Let me tell you, with his leadership, what we accomplished. For two straight years, Senator B
LUNT has been able to raise the appropriations for medical research at the National Insti-tutes of Health by $2 billion or more. The net result of that is that a $30 bil-lion budget has grown to almost $34 billion. What does it mean? It means that researchers don’t get discouraged. They stay on their projects. They keep working to find cures. Secondly, we are making dramatic advances in medicine because of it. His leadership has been absolutely essen-tial. If there is ever a bipartisan issue, this is it. The Senator has been quite a leader in this regard. I want to salute you for that while you are on the floor on the topic of healthcare and children. Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, I ap-preciate my good friend’s comments on this but also his commitment to seeing that we make this happen. As he men-tioned, this is a bipartisan effort, but it is an effort that had about a 10-year lag, and we are doing our best to dra-matically catch up with what is really an important time in healthcare re-search. Mr. DURBIN. I thank my colleague from Missouri. I will tell you that he set a standard. I hope that both parties will agree that this is the starting point. For every year’s budget, the starting point is at least a 5-percent real growth increase in medical re-search. Thank you, Senator BLUNT , for your leadership. 
HEALTHCARE LEGISLATION  
Madam President, I also want to ad-dress an issue that came up in debate last week in the U.S. House of Rep-resentatives; that is, the question of the repeal of the Affordable Care Act. This is an issue where reasonable peo-ple can disagree about how exactly to run our healthcare system. But at the end of the day, I hope that, as with medical research, we can all come together with some basic issues. Congress should not pass a law taking away health insurance coverage from Americans. Let’s start there. Con-gress should work together on a bipar-tisan basis to find ways to reduce the cost of healthcare and health insurance premiums. I think we should agree on that too. Third, we have to find a way to make sure that consumers and families across America are protected with health insurance that is there when they need it. Now, it was a little over a week ago when I became a statistic— not just a Senator but a statistic—in healthcare. I went through a heart catheter procedure in Chicago last week on Tuesday. After that proce-dure—which turned out just fine; thank you—I am a statistic. I am a person in America with a preexisting condition. I have to check that box that says I have had a heart procedure. It used to be if you checked a box like that—diabetes, asthma, whatever you checked—it ended up having a di-rect impact on what you paid for health insurance or whether you could even buy it. There were people who sur-vived cancer—children, adults—who could not buy health insurance because they were too big a risk for health in-surance companies. Well, we changed that. The Afford-able Care Act changed that and said: Just because you have a preexisting condition—and one out of three Ameri-cans has one—you should not be denied coverage. Now, the House of Represent-atives passed a bill that allows Gov-ernors literally to take away that re-quirement in health insurance plans. What are they thinking? Do they think they are so darn lucky that they will never have an accident, never have a diagnosis where they end up with a preexisting condition? It can happen to anybody, and it does. So what the House of Representatives did in this regard is a step backward. They also changed the Medicaid sys-tem. People have this image, when you say Medicaid: Oh, that is the same as Medicare. No, Medicare is for seniors and disabled people. Medicaid is a pol-icy of health insurance that is avail-able for people who do not have a lot of money. Well, who qualifies for that? Well, it turns out that the largest num-ber of people who qualify for Medicaid are children and their moms. In my State of Illinois, half of the kids who are born in the State are cov-ered by Medicaid. So the moms, when they need prenatal care to make sure the babies are healthy, and the babies, when they need care after the hospital, rely on Medicaid. But that is not the most expensive thing when it comes to Medicaid. The most expensive thing in Medicaid are your moms, your grandmoms, and granddads who are in nursing homes. You know what hap-pens? They reach a point where they need to be in a place where folks can watch them and help them. They have medical issues and age is taking its toll. But many of them get there, and all they have is Social Secu-rity and Medicare, and it is not enough. So Medicaid steps in and sup-plements it so that your mom, your dad, or your grandmother can stay in that place, which is good for them, se-cure, safe, and with the right kind of healthcare. The other group that relies on Medicaid the most in their daily lives are disabled people, folks who are born with a disability or have acquired one in life and they need ongoing med-ical care they cannot personally afford. Children and their moms, elderly folks in nursing homes, and disabled people depend on Medicaid. So what does the Republican bill that passed the House of Representatives do to the Medicaid Program across America? It ends up cutting over $800 billion in cov-erage. What it means in Illinois is that 1 million people—out of our 12.5 million population—are likely to lose their health insurance because of the action taken by the House of Representatives. Even my Republican Governor in Illi-nois came out publicly and said what they did in the House of Representa-tives is disastrous for our State. It has a significant negative impact on the cost of healthcare and the coverage of health insurance. So why would we want to do that? Why would we want to take health coverage away from the groups I just mentioned? Do we want to put less money in pre-natal care? Well, if we do, we run the risk that children will be born with problems and challenges that could

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2899 May 11, 2017 
cost us a fortune and compromise their lives. Do we want to put less money into supporting elderly people who are in nursing homes? Well, what are they going to do? What are they supposed to do? If they can’t stay in a place that is good for them and with the right kind of care, does that mean the family now has to find a spare room for grandma or your mom? I hope not. These folks want to live in dignity, and they don’t want to be in a situation where they have to look for charity or beg for help from their families. The third group is disabled people. For goodness sakes, we are lucky. We have people with disabilities who are doing amazing things today. But many who are in lower income categories need the help of Medicaid. I had a group of hospital administra-tors come in to see me this week from Illinois. They were from every part of the State. If you go down to our beau-tiful Southern Illinois area, there are some great towns. One of them is Anna, IL, right near Cobden, IL. It is down in the southern end of our State. It is a very rural area with smaller towns. Then I had administrators in the same group from Quincy, IL, from Springfield, IL, my home town, and from the city of Chicago. They all came here to tell me the same thing: The bill that passed the House of Rep-resentatives last week is a disaster when it comes to Illinois hospitals. They estimate they are going to lose up to 60,000 people who are currently working in hospitals in Illinois, be-cause of that bill, and they are also going to see closures and reductions in services at these same hospitals while we see the Medicaid cutbacks take place. Now, why is that? Let’s assume you have a small rural hospital in a town that you live in. If you do, you value it very much because that means there is healthcare there, right next door, when you need it. You don’t have to drive 50 miles or more. You have it right there. You also know it is a great employer in your area. You also know, as well, that that is the way you keep a lot of busi-nesses in your town and attract new ones. So what these hospitals are telling us is that the bill that passed the House of Representatives to repeal the Afford-able Care Act is a threat to the future of those hospitals. If the patients don’t come in covered by Medicaid and pay for some of their services, the hospitals will still treat them, but they are char-ity patients, then, and the hospitals have to charge every other patient more because of it. So that is a terrible way for us to ap-proach healthcare reform in America. That is the reality of what we face today. I am troubled by the fact that this bill, which passed the House of Representatives by two votes—two votes—if two Congressmen had voted the other way, this bill would not have passed. This bill was never reviewed by the Congressional Budget Office. Well, who cares? I care. For everything we do that is sup-posed to be that important to affect the American economy, we are sup-posed to go to the nonpartisan experts and ask them: Well, what does this really do? We have been held to that standard—Democrats have and Repub-licans, too—until now. Now, we have this decision by the House of Rep-resentatives to pass this bill affecting America’s healthcare system—one-fifth of our economy, I might add—and they never went for an analysis to the Con-gressional Budget Office. That has never happened before. They did it anyway. You know why they did it? Because the first version of this bill was a disaster. They sent that bill in for an analysis—24 million Americans losing their health insur-ance over the next 10 years. It was a disaster. They were afraid they would get the same analysis on the second bill. So they never sent it in for the analysis. In 2 weeks, we are going to have the numbers. But it really gives you fair warning that this bill could be very hurtful to a lot of people across America, and yet it passed the House of Representatives. So today people say to me in Illinois, when I have town meetings: Well, we are listening to you, Senator. But what do you want to do about healthcare today? What would you change in the current system? Well, let me tell you first. I voted for the Affordable Care Act. I believe in it. The number of un-insured people in America—the per-centage—has been cut in half because of the Affordable Care Act. Is it per-fect? Of course not. Does it need to be changed? Yes. I can give you two or three specifics, and I will. First, we have to do some-thing about the price of drugs in Amer-ica—pharmaceuticals. You see what is happening. Hedge funds are buying the rights to drugs and raising the prices two, three, four, and ten times because they have an exclusive drug. There is a family I have come to know who has a young son who is in high school in Chi-cago. He has diabetes. He is an amazing kid. He is going to be a great success in life. He has fought diabetes for years and years. His mom and dad have stood behind him. They came in to tell me: Do you know what has happened to the cost of insulin—insulin—which diabetics need dramatically? It has gone up two, three, four, and five times in the last few years for no reason other than that they can charge it. Of course, a person with diabetes may be dependent on that insulin even to survive. So the first thing we ought to do when we look at the healthcare system is figure out how to make sure that we have reasonable pricing when it comes to pharmaceuticals. Of course, I want them to make a profit. Those pharma-ceutical companies, with a profit mo-tive, will keep doing research to find the next drug. But do I want these hedge funds and others—investment bankers—to buy out the rights to those drugs and drive their prices through the roof? That is not fair. It adds dra-matically to the cost of healthcare. Blue Cross Blue Shield is one of the biggest insurers in America. It is the biggest in my State of Illinois. My wife and I have a plan with them. So the head of Blue Cross Blue Shield came to me, and she said: Senator, did you know that last year Blue Cross Blue Shield paid more for pharmaceuticals than they paid for inpatient hospital care? What? Inpatient hospital care, people who have to come in for sur-geries and things—you paid more for pharmaceuticals? Yes. Well, there are things we can do about it. I have legislation that I have introduced that reviews the pricing on pharmaceuticals, holds the pharma-ceutical companies accountable. I take a position on an issue that all of my colleagues don’t share, but I want to share it with you. There are only two nations in the world—only two—that allow pharmaceutical companies to ad-vertise on television. The United States and New Zealand. Well, what difference does it make? Have you turned on the TV lately and tried to find a show that did not have ads about pharmaceuticals? Have you tried to write down the names of some of those pharmaceuticals so that you might remember them if it is some-thing of interest? Have you tried to lis-ten to the warnings that they give you about all of these pharmaceuticals? Well, some of the warnings are amaz-ing: If you have had a liver transplant, be sure and tell your doctor. Well, yes, that explains that incision. A liver transplant? Why do they do that? Why do they buy all of those ads on tele-vision? Real simple. If you have some condition, and they talk about it in one of those ads, you are going to ask your doctor about that drug, and it is likely, in many cases, that doctor, then, will end up prescribing that drug. Is it necessary? It may not be. Is it the cheapest form of the drug? It may not be. So, then, why does the doctor write the prescription? Because it is easier to do that than a 10-minute stop in the office for him to sit down with you and patiently explain: You don’t need this drug, or you can use a ge-neric, or we ought to wait a while be-fore we go into this. The result of it is that more and more pharmaceutical companies have their drugs being prescribed and more and more profits coming their way. So I, for one, think that this direct con-sumer advertising is really hurtful in terms of the cost of healthcare in our country, and it is something we ought to deal with. I would make that part of the reform of the Affordable Care Act. The second thing we need to do is to make sure, I believe, that in every place in America, if you so choose, you can choose a Medicare-type public plan

to cover your family. Right now, it is private health insurance companies. You may choose to stick with the pri-vate health insurance company. That should be your choice. But you also ought to have a Medicare-type plan. Over 50 million Americans are cov-ered by Medicare, and most of them— the overwhelming majority of them— are happy with Medicare. What if we had a Medicare-type plan, a public op-tion, available to every American to choose if they wish? I think that could reduce the cost of healthcare, and I think it is an option we ought to con-sider. The third point I would make is that when we are dealing with reforming the healthcare system, we have one group in particular who is giving us a real challenge: individuals who are buying health insurance. The vast ma-jority of Americans get their health in-surance through their employment and many others through Medicaid—a pro-gram I described earlier—and then there is that group out there buying in-surance on the open market. They are the ones who are seeing the runup in premiums and costs and overruns that they have to face, seeing copayments going up and the like. We need to find a way to deal with this group to give them affordable health insurance. There are a lot of ways to approach that, but that ought to be a target of what we do for the ones who are facing the toughest increases in health insur-ance. I will just say this too: The good news about this conversation in the Senate is that it is finally reaching a new level. Now there are 12 Republican Senators who are meeting with Sen-ator M
CCONNELL , and they are setting out to draw up a plan and try to pass it with just Republican votes. I hope that does not succeed, and I will tell you why. If we can do this on a bipar-tisan basis and sit down in good faith and work out these improvements to the Affordable Care Act, that is the best option for this country. Senator C
OLLINS of Maine and Senator C ASSIDY  of Louisiana are trying to start that conversation. I have said to them that if this is a good-faith effort not to re-peal the Affordable Care Act but to re-pair it, I want to pull a chair up to the table. Let’s have this conversation. We may not agree, we may not be able to come up with the best solutions, but the bi-partisan approach of solving the cur-rent problems with the current healthcare system is a much more sen-sible thing to do than to have an all- Republican bill trying to force its way through here. I hope that doesn’t hap-pen. It is far better to do this on a bi-partisan basis, and I hope that is what will be done. I will be going home, as I do regu-larly, to talk about the impact of the bill passed by the House of Representa-tives. I have just touched on some of the major points of it. There is one thing I do want to men-tion, though. It has an age tax in it that many people between the ages of 50 and 64 may not be aware of. Currently the law says that there cannot be a disparity of difference in premiums charged of more than 3 to 1; that is, the most expensive premium charged to someone for health insur-ance, no matter what their health or condition, cannot be more than three times the lowest premium charged. That is current law. The bill passed in the House of Representatives changed that dramatically. It says: Instead of 3 to 1, let’s make it 5 to 1. Who is going to pay the difference? Folks who are older and those facing chronic illness. If you are between the ages of 50 and 64, watch out for your health insurance premiums under this measure that passed the House of Representatives. That is something which should not have been included. That is why the American Association of Retired Per-sons has come out against this bill. It is another reason we have to ensure that the bill that passed the House of Representatives does not become the law of the land. To have this discrimi-nation against people because of their age is unfair, and I agree with the American Association of Retired Per-sons on that particular issue. Let’s hope we can find a bipartisan path to making healthcare even better in America. I don’t care who takes the credit for it. If at the end of the day more families have peace of mind with health insurance that they can afford, that provides them quality care when they need it, that is something we need to achieve. As I said earlier, I again learned this lesson last week. The lesson is simply this: If you go in for a diagnosis and learn that you need quality healthcare, you want to have health insurance. You want to have access to the best doctors and hospitals. Everyone in America wants that. That shouldn’t be a privilege which is reserved just for the rich and lucky; that ought to be there for every single American. I believe healthcare is a right, not a privilege. If we start off with that premise, we can build a healthcare sys-tem in this country that is still the envy of the world. Mr. M
CCAIN. Madam President, today I come to the floor in opposition to the nomination of Robert Lighthizer to be United States Trade Representa-tive, USTR. After close examination of the confirmation process for Mr. Lighthizer, I have come to the conclu-sion that Mr. Lighthizer does not ade-quately understand the positive eco-nomic benefits the North American Free Trade Agreement, NAFTA, has had and will continue to have on Ari-zona and our Nation. His advocacy for protectionist shifts in America’s trade policies, including his support for the withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, TPP, and the Trump ad-ministration’s incoherent and incon-sistent trade posture, have only solidi-fied my opposition to his nomination to be USTR. As I wrote in a February piece in the Arizona Republic, coauthored by my colleague Senator FLAKE and Arizona chamber president Glenn Hammer, NAFTA has delivered enormous eco-nomic benefits to the United States since its inception in 1994, especially for the citizens of Arizona. In just two decades, Arizona’s exports to Canada and Mexico have increased by $5.7 bil-lion, or 236 percent. Mexico stands as Arizona’s No. 1 trading partner, with bilateral trade accounting for 40 per-cent of our State’s exports to foreign markets in 2015 and totaling $9.2 bil-lion. Arizona’s trade relationship with Mexico also directly supports more than 100,000 Arizona jobs. While I understand NAFTA could be strengthened and modernized, any ef-forts by this administration to with-draw from NAFTA or impose new re-strictions or barriers on our ability to trade with Mexico and Canada will have serious consequences for Arizona, including massive job losses for work-ers and dramatically higher costs for consumers. Furthermore, I am troubled by the need for and the process by which Congress recently granted Mr. Lighthizer a waiver to serve as USTR given that he previously represented a Brazilian and Chinese client in trade litigation matters. As part of the Lob-bying Disclosure Act of 1995, Congress adopted my amendment to prohibit an individual from serving as U.S. Trade Representative or Deputy U.S. Trade Representative if that person has ‘‘di-rectly represented, aided, or advised a foreign entity’’ in ‘‘any trade negotia-tion, or trade dispute, with the United States.’’ Ultimately, the waiver was tucked in the must-pass omnibus spending bill, with no chance to debate or vote on such an important trade re-lated policy. As Senator S
ASSE and I recently wrote in a letter opposing Mr. Lighthizer, the administration’s inco-herent and protectionist message on trade ‘‘is especially troubling because confirming a USTR grants the Admin-istration additional legal authority to negotiate trade deals that Congress must consider under ‘fast track’ proce-dures. Given these circumstances, granting the Trump Administration additional legal powers through your confirmation without understanding how you or the Administration intend to use those powers would be irrespon-sible.’’ I plan to vote against the nomination of Mr. Lighthizer, and I urge colleagues to join me. Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Presi-dent, I support the nomination of Rob-ert Lighthizer to be the United States Trade Representative. Trade agreements should meet two tests: Does the agreement improve worker wages? And does the agreement add American jobs? For far too long, U.S. Trade Representatives have prioritized profits of large multi-national organizations over the inter-ests of the American people and our country as a whole.

The USTR should be someone who negotiates on behalf of the American worker and advances labor and envi-ronmental protections, and the USTR should be someone who works to en-force agreements. While I don’t agree with everything in Mr. Lighthizer’s re-sume, his record suggests that he will be a USTR who will approach trade policies in the ways I have outlined. I hope the approach he takes going for-ward will reflect the positions he has taken in the past. I expect him to ask: Does it improve worker wages? And does it add American jobs? I believe that Mr. Lighthizer will bring fresh eyes to trade policy. I hope that he will focus on increasing trans-parency at the USTR. I hope that he will stand up for worker rights, both domestically and internationally. I hope that Mr. Lighthizer will work to enforce trade policies that protect the environment. Mr. DURBIN.

TRADE  
Mr. MORAN. Madam President, I come from a State that in some ways is very similar to yours, the State of Kansas. You get to see firsthand the impact of trade and exports on the peo-ple, on jobs, and on the economic op-portunity of my communities. Our State economy relies on our ability to sell the products we grow and manufac-ture to people around the globe. Strengthening our trade relation-ships and expanding market access for exports abroad creates a greater oppor-tunity for Kansans today and those who follow us. One of my goals has al-ways been to make certain that com-munities across Kansas remain a place in which the young men and women who grow up there find it to be a place to raise their families. Our ability to do that, especially in a small, rural community with agriculture and agri-cultural exports, is so important. It is a way that we can really put America first. If our goal is to have an America that has strength and prosperity, we ought to continue to focus on improv-ing our Nation’s economy. That is one of the things that I appreciate—we seem to be focused in such a significant way on our ability to grow an econ-omy. I think we are poised for much greater things economically. ‘‘Economics’’ may sound like just one of those words, but what that means is more jobs, better jobs, more secure jobs, jobs for our children so that maybe they can pay back their student loans. This country des-perately needs the jobs in the commu-nities across Kansas and around the country, and it is really what we call the American dream. Trade, including our ability to sell the food and fiber we grow in our State, is a key part that drives our economy forward. Almost half of the wheat grown in Kansas is exported to foreign markets. What that means is, if you weren’t doing that, nearly half of the acres planted in our State would be idle. That means the communities those farmers and ranchers live in and around would have half of the amount of economic activity that currently is occurring. American ranchers ship over 1 million metric tons of beef to con-sumers abroad. Thousands of acres of corn, sorghum, and soybeans being planted this spring across Kansas and the Nation will ultimately be exported. Approximately 95 percent of the world’s consumers live outside Amer-ica’s borders. To reach those con-sumers, our Nation must produce a trade policy that grows the existing ex-port markets while continuously build-ing and developing new ones. Without export markets, both production and prices would fall for farmers and ranch-ers, and rural communities supported by agriculture would disappear. The revenue generated by exports not only keeps family farmers and ranchers afloat, it drives rural economies and supports small businesses. The aerospace industry, which is so important in Kansas, also relies on an integrated supply chain and strong trade policy. Wichita, KS—appro-priately labeled the ‘‘Air Capital of the World’’—manufactures more than half of the world’s general aviation light aircraft and business jets. Without trade, aerospace and manufacturing fa-cilities in Wichita and surrounding areas and Kansas City and surrounding areas would not exist and workers in those factories would be left without job opportunities. It is critical that we protect these jobs, many of which depend upon the United States having a strong eco-nomic relationship with Canada and Mexico. The North America Free-Trade Agreement, which went into effect in 1994, plays a significant role in sup-porting trade with those two neigh-boring nations. Of course, the world and technology have changed since 1994 when that agreement was entered into. There are areas of the agreement that can be im-proved and modernized. Many of those changes have been discussed and are issues that the United States, Canada, and Mexico agreed to during TPP nego-tiations, such as strengthening our in-tellectual property rights and new pro-visions for e-commerce. If we work collaboratively with Mex-ico and Canada to address the issues with NAFTA, including the issues on which we strongly disagree, I am con-fident we can improve the agreement for all parties. But efforts to pull out of NAFTA completely or to weaken our trading relationship with Canada and Mexico during renegotiations would cause significant damage to the Amer-ican economy. We must have willing negotiators sitting across the table when discussing NAFTA, and that starts with treating our neighbors as trade partners and as friends. We need to treat these folks as friends, and we need to seize the opportunities we have. Working together to improve NAFTA or building economic relations with other trading partners does not mean America should take a step back from enforcing the current rules. Oftentimes in the past, we have been too focused on striking trade deals and selling them to the public, but we haven’t done enough to make sure other coun-tries are playing by the rules that are negotiated. Nontariff barriers and un-fair trading practices by foreign coun-tries harm our producers, workers, and consumers. We must make certain American pro-ducers are competing on a level play-ing field in a global market and that our jobs and wages are not being under-mined by other countries’ efforts to distort trade policies and trade agree-ments. Many Americans have lost confidence in trade agreements, and I believe that is partly because the benefits of trade agreements have been oversold, while the enforcement of unfair trade prac-tices have been insufficient. In pro-moting agreements, leaders had set ex-pectations for increased jobs, higher wages, growth in exports, and many other metrics that were impossible to meet. When these exaggerated prom-ises did not come to fruition, many people lost confidence in those trade agreements. America should strengthen our com-mitment to holding other countries ac-countable in order to inspire greater confidence from the American public in our Nation’s ability to reach a trade agreement that benefits us all. Weakening our trade relations will cause Kansans to lose jobs. Farmers and ranchers will no longer be able to pursue their careers and lifestyle. But with strong leadership and smart nego-tiating, I am convinced that America can improve our trade relationships in the world and continue to build on the economic successes we have today. A robust U.S. economy that provides market opportunities for farmers, ranchers, and manufacturers, and job prospects for workers is an essential pillar of America’s strength and well- being. Strong trade relationships, par-ticularly with Canada and Mexico, are primary drivers of our Nation’s econ-omy. We must protect those relation-ships and carefully consider changes in our approach to trade to be certain that Americans continue to benefit from economic opportunities that are created by a strong trade policy. Madam President, our relationships with Mexico and Canada are important and in many ways determine the eco-nomic future of the people of my State at home.

RUSSIA INVESTIGATION  
Ms. HIRONO. Madam President, these are not ordinary times. It is not ordinary for a winning Presidential campaign to be under investigation for collusion with a foreign adversary to influence our 2016 election and under-mine our democracy. It isn’t ordinary for a President to fire the man respon-sible for conducting this very inves-tigation. It isn’t ordinary for a Presi-dent whose campaign is under inves-tigation for having ties to Russia to hold an Oval Office meeting with that country’s Foreign Minister and only invite the Russian press. This meeting came only a day after firing the person in charge of the Russia-Trump inves-tigation. Yet, here we are. The ques-tion is, What should we do next? The events of the past 48 hours have been shocking and concerning. Firing FBI Director James Comey in this manner, under this pretext, and at this time is a total disservice to the Amer-ican people. President Trump hopes the American people will believe he fired Director Comey because of how he treated Hil-lary Clinton during the Presidential campaign. President Trump hopes, as his Deputy Press Secretary said on Tuesday night, that the American peo-ple think it is ‘‘time to move on.’’ President Trump hopes his attempts to distract us from the importance of get-ting to the bottom of the Russia- Trump matter will succeed. President Trump’s hopes are misplaced. If any-thing, President Trump’s firing of Di-rector Comey has resulted in an in-creased concern about the Trump team’s connections to Russian inter-ference with our 2016 Presidential elec-tion. The country is asking, Mr. President, what do you have to hide? We are learning practically on an hourly basis about how the President made this decision to fire Director Comey and why. This information does not square with the official line com-ing from the White House, which also changes. Most recently, the Washington Post reported that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein threatened to resign after the White House misrepresented his role in the decision to fire Director Comey. CNN reported that President Trump fired Director Comey because he would not provide ‘‘assurance of per-sonal loyalty.’’ Both CNN and the Wall Street Journal reported that the deci-sion to fire Director Comey came after the FBI’s investigation was accel-erating. All of this information has emerged in the last 48 hours or so. This kind of Presidential inter-ference, through the firing of the FBI Director during an ongoing investiga-tion, is unprecedented, suspicious, and deeply concerning. These revelations and those that are sure to come further argue in favor of appointing a special prosecutor to fully investigate the Rus-sia-Trump matter. A special prosecutor with full autonomy can follow the evi-dence wherever it leads and prosecute as appropriate. I call upon Republicans of conscience to stand up and join the call for a spe-cial prosecutor. Over the past few days, a number of my Republican colleagues have spoken out against the way the President had fired James Comey. In particular, I would like to acknowledge Senators M
CCAIN, SASSE, F LAKE , B URR, K EN-
NEDY , BOOZMAN , and C ORKER for speak-ing out. I hope, as more information about President Trump’s decision to fire Director Comey emerges, our Re-publican colleagues will join in the call for a special prosecutor. Leader M
CCONNELL argued yesterday that appointing a special prosecutor would disrupt the ongoing work of the Senate committees that are conducting their own investigations. I disagree. The Senate Select Committee on Intel-ligence and the Senate Judiciary Com-mittee have important oversight re-sponsibilities regarding the Russia- Trump matter, but neither committee has the power to convene a grand jury or prosecute any crimes that may have been committed. Therefore, I reiterate the need for a special prosecutor with the mandate and authority to follow the facts wherever they lead—free of political considerations. In the coming weeks, President Trump will nominate a new Director for the FBI. This person must be above reproach and be someone whose inde-pendent judgment can earn the coun-try’s confidence. I have been disturbed by some of the names being floated as potential replacements, names like Chris Christie and Rudy Giuliani. We cannot allow President Trump to ap-point one of his buddies to oversee the Russia-Trump investigation or to lead the FBI. The investigation into the Russia- Trump matter cannot and should not be a partisan issue. We should all care that a foreign government has sought to interfere with our elections and with our democracy. This is not just about the election. This is really about pro-tecting our democracy. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. S
ASSE). The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, there is a Chinese curse that reads: ‘‘May you live in interesting times.’’ To call the times that we find our-selves in right now ‘‘interesting’’ would be certainly an understatement. The fact is, we find ourselves and our coun-try in a moment that is profoundly testing the rule of law here in America, profoundly testing the strength of our democratic institutions. We have a President who has now engaged in a pattern of removing individuals from office who are executing their respon-sibilities under the law. First, on January 30, just 11 days into the Trump administration, it was Sally Yates, the Acting Attorney General, who warned the administration that Michael Flynn had been compromised by his connections to Russia—an in-credibly responsible act for her to take, but she was fired. On March 10, it was Preet Bharara, the U.S. attorney in New York, who was reportedly investigating whether Secretary Price had profited from his position in Congress. He had been told he would be retained by this adminis-tration when suddenly he was fired. Then this week, Tuesday, the Presi-dent fired James Comey, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation; James Comey, who was leading the FBI’s investigation into the possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia in the Presidential election and who was scheduled to testify before the U.S. Senate this week; James Comey; who had just recently asked for more funding and resources in order to appropriately and substantially inves-tigate Russian interference in our elec-tions and possible connections to the Trump campaign; James Comey, whose investigation just handed down its first round of subpoenas. The firing of James Comey has more than a passing resemblance to Nixon’s Saturday Night Massacre, the infa-mous incident in October of 1973, when President Nixon ordered the Attorney General to fire the special prosecutor who was investigating Watergate. Nixon wanted to derail that investiga-tion. The Attorney General, Elliott Richardson, refused to do so and re-signed. His deputy, William Ruckels-haus, refused to do so and resigned. Day by day, we have seen more con-nections, bits and pieces, come to light—conversations involving Michael Flynn, former campaign manager Paul Manafort, Carter Page, and Attorney General Sessions. The President insists there is no ‘‘there’’ there, but we have seen a pat-tern of conversations that we don’t fully understand. Was there coordina-tion between the Trump campaign and the Russians to interfere in the U.S. Presidential election? Was there col-laboration? We don’t know. We know there were a lot of conversations, but what was the substance of those con-versations? And who instructed those meetings to take place? What is the full pattern of these events? It is important that we get to the bottom of it because what every Amer-ican understands is, if you conspire

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2903 May 11, 2017 
with a foreign government to under-mine the integrity of the American elections, you are conspiring to under-mine the integrity of the American Government itself; that this is a ter-rible assault, a terrible crime against our country. The President’s team says this firing of Director Comey had nothing to do with the Russia investigation. They did so through a series of documents, in-cluding a letter from Attorney General Jeff Sessions to the President, a memo to Jeff Sessions from Rod Rosenstein, and the President writing a letter to James Comey saying you are fired. So the memo from Rosenstein to the AG, the AG’s letter to the President, the President’s letter saying you are fired, and all of this claiming the basis of the investigation was because they were dissatisfied with the way James Comey had treated Secretary Clinton. Now, that doesn’t really fit with the history we are familiar with. The President told audiences at a campaign rally in October: ‘‘I tell you what, what he did, he brought back his reputa-tion.’’ He is referring to James Comey. ‘‘He brought it back.’’ And then when the President talked to ‘‘60 Minutes,’’ he said: ‘‘I respect him a lot,’’ when he was asked about Director Comey in the context of the actions he had taken in regard to Sec-retary Hillary Clinton. We remember the chants at his ral-lies: ‘‘Lock her up.’’ I don’t think there is a single Amer-ican—not a single Member of this body of 100 Senators—who believes for a mo-ment—not for a microsecond—that the reasoning in this memo from the Dep-uty AG to the AG and the letter from the AG to the President and the Presi-dent’s memo to James Comey, that the arguments made here were the basis of his firing. If you believe the President woke up and said: I am so concerned about the way James Comey treated Hillary Clin-ton that he just has to be dismissed, then I have some oceanfront property in Arizona I would be happy to sell you. We know from the reporting of the last few days that there is quite an-other story—an accurate story—about why the President fired James Comey. We now know the President had be-come increasingly frustrated with Di-rector Comey because he wouldn’t go along with the story line the President wanted. The President wanted him to support his claim that the Obama ad-ministration had wiretapped Trump Tower, but Director Comey, caring about the integrity of his team at the FBI and the office, refused to do so. In fact, he clarified that there is abso-lutely no information that corrobo-rates the President’s claim that Trump Tower had been wiretapped by Presi-dent Obama. We know the President was frus-trated that the Director was doing his job to explore—that is, to investigate— Russia’s actions in our campaign, in our Presidential campaign, and that he was frustrated that there was looking into potential ties between his cam-paign and the Russians. He didn’t like a lot about the fact that Director Comey was asking for more resources to be able to do a thorough investiga-tion. Well, we know the result. According to a report in the Wash-ington Post this morning, President Trump made his final decision to fire the Director last weekend while he was golfing on his property in New Jersey. He then tasked the AG and the Deputy Attorney General to come up with a cover story. This is an astonishing chain of events. What we have here is the Presi-dent making a decision based on the appropriate efforts of the FBI to inves-tigate a potential crime against the United States of America. What we have here is a President determining he wanted to derail that investigation, and he went to the AG and the Deputy AG to say: Help me do this. Help me derail this investigation. Give me a cover story I can sell to the American public. And Attorney General Sessions complied and Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein complied. Now, that is quite different than what happened in the Saturday Night Massacre. In the Saturday Night Mas-sacre, when the President said to the Attorney General: Get rid of that spe-cial prosecutor so I can derail the in-vestigation, the Attorney General stood up and said: No way, and re-signed—the Deputy Attorney General resigned, but that is not what we have here. We have now our AG agreeing to develop a cover story for the President. Now, this memo from Attorney Gen-eral Sessions reads as follows: ‘‘As At-torney General, I am committed to a high level of discipline, integrity, and the rule of law to the Department of Justice.’’ Let me ask this question, Where is the integrity in collaborating in a false story in order to derail an investiga-tion, an important investigation to the very heart of the integrity of our sys-tem of government? Where, I ask the Attorney General, is the integrity in developing a cover story—a false story to cover up the action of derailing an investigation. That is the opposite of integrity. To the Deputy, who also agreed to conspire in this deception of the Amer-ican public, where is your integrity? Where was your commitment to jus-tice? So here we have events that are deep-ly disturbing not only in terms of the President’s decision to falsely mislead the American public but also to the At-torney General’s decision to collabo-rate in that and the Deputy Attorney General’s decision to support it. How is this not obstruction of justice? If anyone here thinks for a moment that the President is going to nomi-nate a new head of the FBI and ask that individual to conduct a robust in-vestigation of Russia’s entanglement in the U.S. elections, I have another thought for you: It is not going to hap-pen. The President has deliberately, in-tentionally derailed this investigation, and the Justice Department has no in-tention of making it go forward again. We need to hear from these top offi-cials. We need to have these officials come to the U.S. Senate, to a com-mittee of the whole, to tell us their story and answer these questions about what they have just done to violate the integrity of the Department of Justice. We need to have a special prosecutor. We know the head of the FBI, when we have one again, is not going to be able to conduct a robust investigation. Therefore, we need a special prosecutor to get to the bottom of this. The Amer-ican people deserve no less. The res-toration of integrity of the U.S. Gov-ernment deserves no less. Lady Justice carries scales in her hands, and where is the blindfold? The whole point is that no one in America is above the law, no one—not Presi-dents or Vice Presidents, not AGs or Deputy AGs. Lady Justice is all about getting the facts, following the facts where they go, holding individuals ac-countable, when we get those facts, when we get that information. That is what we need to do now. We need to get to the bottom of this. We need to have that special prosecutor. We need to make sure that if anyone did conspire with the Russians, they are held to the full account of the law because conspiring with a foreign coun-try to undermine the integrity of U.S. elections is treasonous conduct. This is not a traffic ticket. This is a question of treasonous—conspiring with a for-eign government, undermining the U.S. Presidential election. I am deeply disturbed about this turn of events. I am deeply disturbed about the information we have. We need to get the full, full story, the complete story, and make sure justice is served. Thank you, Mr. President. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Idaho. Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the remarks of Senator M
URPHY , there be 20 minutes of postcloture time remain-ing on the Lighthizer nomination, equally divided between the chairman and ranking member of the Finance Committee; that following the use or yielding back of that time, the Senate vote on the Lighthizer nomination; and that, if confirmed, the motion to recon-sider be considered made and laid upon the table, and the President be imme-diately notified of the Senate’s action. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. RISCH. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Connecticut. Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I thank Senator M

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES2904 May 11, 2017 
and the imagined rationale that the President gave. 
HEALTHCARE LEGISLATION  
Mr. President, secret meetings have been happening amongst our Repub-lican colleagues to draft a healthcare bill that could have devastating con-sequences on the people we all rep-resent. I know we are about to have a vote on the floor, but I wanted to come to the floor to simply remind all of my friends on both sides of the aisle of the promises that have been made about this process and this piece of legisla-tion which emerged from the House last week with devastating con-sequences. Those consequences include 24 million people losing coverage and people with preexisting conditions being subjected to $200,000 premium in-creases, potentially. I just reference the words of the President of the United States, who told us repeatedly over and over again, during the campaign and after the campaign, that the result of this healthcare reform debate was going to be a healthcare system that was better. President Trump outlined that in a number of different ways. Here is what he said on April 30, just a few weeks ago. He said: 
The healthcare plan is on its way. Will have much lower premiums & deductibles, while at the same time taking care of pre-existing conditions! 
That is not true. That is a lie. The healthcare bill that emerged from the House of Representatives did none of those things. CBO has not come out with its final estimate. It is unbelievable that the House voted on a reordering of one- sixth of the American economy with-out a CBO estimate, but we can pretty much be sure that the first CBO esti-mate will hold, in that it will say that premiums are going to go up by 15 to 20 percent immediately for everybody, and then for the nonyoung healthy and wealthy, premiums are going to go up even higher. It didn’t take care of preexisting con-ditions. It did the opposite—allowed every State to be able to walk away from the protection of the Affordable Care Act, which makes sure people with preexisting conditions, which could be one-third of all Americans, can’t be subject to higher rates, and it substituted that requirement with a high-risk pool which is dramatically underfunded to the point that it is laughable, in the opinion of many healthcare economists. Here is what Donald Trump said ear-lier this year: 
We’re going to have insurance for every-body. People covered under the law can ex-pect to have great healthcare. . . . Much less expensive and much better insurance for ev-erybody. 
CBO says 24 million people will lose their insurance, and that number might be higher when the new estimate comes out. This wasn’t true. This was a lie. Finally, the President said, during the campaign: I was the first & only potential GOP can-didate to state there will be no cuts to Social Security, Medicare & Medicaid. 
No cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid—this is a giant cut to Medicaid. This is an $880 billion cut to Medicaid being used to finance a giant tax cut for people making over $200,000 a year. This wasn’t true. This was a lie as well. A lot of Democrats will be willing to talk about making our healthcare sys-tem better, but we want our Repub-lican colleagues, as they are having these behind-closed-door meetings, to remember the promises that were made. They said nobody would lose in-surance, premiums would go down—not up—and your benefit package wouldn’t become worse. If Republicans can de-liver on those promises, then there is a discussion to be had. But if anything looking like the House product emerges, it is a violation of the prom-ises this President and many Repub-licans made over and over again. Finally, I also want all my colleagues to remember what is happening as we speak. Leader M
CCONNELL was on the floor talking about premium increases announced by Blue Cross Blue Shield in Maryland. What he failed to mention was the head of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Maryland came out and specifically said that a big part of the reason they were asking for major premium in-creases was because of the actions President Trump is taking right now to sabotage the Affordable Care Act. They were not sure the individual mandate was going to be enforced. Why? Be-cause in an Executive order this Presi-dent signed, he directed his agencies to undermine the Affordable Care Act and to withdraw many of the fees levied on Americans, such as that which comes if you don’t get insurance. He stopped ad-vertising for the exchanges for the last week. We were on target to have more people sign up this year than ever be-fore; but then, in the last week, the President withdrew all the money for the exchanges. Right now, as we speak, this administration is bleeding out the money for insurers to help pay for cost sharing within the exchanges 1 month at a time, not telegraphing if there is going to be any certainty for that fund-ing in the future. The President is undermining and sabotaging the ACA every single day. The reason insurers are passing along premium increases or considering with-drawing from these exchanges is be-cause of this sabotage the administra-tion is undertaking of our entire healthcare system. I hope these behind- closed-door meetings take into account all of the promises this President and our Republican friends made that they would repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it with something better. Everything we hear is that the product that emerged out of the House of Rep-resentatives—the product that may emerge out of the Senate—violates every single one of these promises. We await the ability to work to-gether, Republicans and Democrats, to preserve what works in the healthcare system, to fix what doesn’t work, and to hold our Republican friends and the President of the United States to their promises. I yield back. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there are 20 min-utes of postcloture time remaining, equally divided between the chairman and the ranking member of the Com-mittee on Finance, prior to a vote on the Lighthizer nomination. The Senator from Oregon. Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague and good friend, Chair-man HATCH , for his courtesies. We have worked very closely together on this nomination. This was a challenging task, and I thank Chairman H
ATCH for his cooperation. Mr. Lighthizer needed a waiver be-cause he had represented foreign inter-ests. It was extremely important that we work with Senator M
ANCHIN and other colleagues to address the enor-mous needs of the miners, and we had a whole host of Members with a variety of extremely important trade issues— matters like steel, aluminum, and dig-ital goods in our part of the world; we also care about softwood lumber tre-mendously. Chairman H
ATCH and I worked with all the members of the Finance Com-mittee. It was a unanimous vote, and I thank him for his cooperation. We have talked a little bit about trade and what a modern trade policy is going to look like. The Lighthizer discussion is the beginning of the de-bate on trade in this Congress, and I have tried to be clear about my agenda. My agenda is to create more red, white, and blue jobs in America—high-skilled, high-waged jobs. Very often, the trade jobs pay better than do the nontrade jobs because there is more value added in them; there is a higher level of pro-ductivity. So my view is, as we set out on this journey to get more high- skilled, high-waged jobs, look to Asia where there are going to be 1 billion middle-class people there in a few years. What we ought to do is focus on growing them in the United States, making them in the United States, adding value to them in the United States, and then shipping them some-where. That is my idea of a modern trade agenda. So far, the administration’s trade agenda amounts to a muddle of 140- character tweets, mixed messages, and overhyped announcements that seem to be backed by not much substance. I think we are going to have to put to-gether a coherent strategy quickly to promote our exports and fight back against trade cheats. That is not ex-actly what we have seen from the ad-ministration to date. We can almost suffer whiplash from the reports about what happens with various trade deals. Late at night, it was reported that the President is about to pull the United States out of NAFTA; then suddenly there is another

report saying he has changed his mind after a conversation with the Cana-dians. Next, at a moment of extreme tension on the Korean Peninsula, it is reported that the President is threat-ening to pull out of the U.S.-Korea trade agreement. Then suddenly that threat is walked back. So the President has made some major statements with respect to trade deals on the books, but he has yet to give us much in the way of specifics on how he would like to bring that about. If one is trying to run a business in Oregon or around the United States that exports to foreign markets, it is pretty hard not to feel rattled and con-fused by some of the President’s state-ments and tweets about trade. One might even make the decision not to invest and not to hire additional work-ers. I hope the President will soon see that some of the uncertainty and con-fusion that has been stoked as a nego-tiating tactic is not a recipe for cre-ating red, white, and blue jobs. I do think Robert Lighthizer knows what the challenge is really all about, and I want to tell him I have appre-ciated our conversations. He is a real pro at this. I have appreciated his views, particularly on digital goods, which I think are so important to our burgeoning technology sector, and his views on Canadian lumber. I would also like to state at this time that I think very highly of Secretary Ross. He has been very constructive in our conversations, particularly on Ca-nadian softwood lumber. Obviously, the U.S. Trade Represent-ative will lead our country in trade ne-gotiations, and that will be Mr. Lighthizer’s role. The bulk of the ex-pertise of trade does reside within his office. When Mr. Lighthizer is con-firmed, as I hope he will be and expect he will be, this expertise will no longer be silent. I will wrap up simply by way of say-ing that the United States may be the world’s largest economy, but it rep-resents only 4 percent of the world’s consumers. Red, white, and blue jobs in the United States depend on our ability to sell to the other 96 percent. The number of middle-class households around the world is going to double over the next decade. This represents a lot of potential buying power for the American brand, the Oregon brand. The fact is, people all over the world love buying the goods and the services we make. It is going to take a lot of hard work to smash through the barriers that block American-made goods and fight back against trade cheats. Lastly, the trade rules in many par-ticulars are out of date, so we have a lot of work to do to promote labor rights, combat human trafficking, crack down on trade in illegally taking wildlife and endangered species, and get the trade system updated so it in-cludes things like digital goods and small businesses that now have an international reach, which is especially important. The trading system has to respond more quickly to countries that break the rules or are unfairly pro-ducing basic commodities, such as steel and aluminum. This is especially true with respect to China. As policymakers, we must continue to take an honest look at the trade rules and fix what doesn’t work so that American workers aren’t left behind. It is long past time to invest more re-sources in monitoring, litigating, and enforcing our trading partners’ obliga-tions, including China’s. The United States must respond more aggressively and more rapidly to threats to U.S. workers and businesses. There was a recent example of how this is done right when the Commerce Department said ‘‘enough’’ to Canada’s unfairly traded softwood lumber. The steps the Commerce Department took were undeniably warranted after mill towns in Oregon and many other States have been clobbered over the last few decades. My first preference is a long- term agreement with Canada, but if they are not going to come to the table, I will keep fighting for our mills and mill jobs, and I will insist the ad-ministration do the same. The U.S. needs to carry that same steadfast approach across the board— getting trade enforcement right is not just a lumber issue. That means more resources for boots on the ground: in-vestigators and enforcers. Not just at the office of the USTR but also at Cus-toms and Border Protection and the Departments of Commerce, Agri-culture, Labor, State, and Interior, where investigators are tasked with stopping trade in illegally taken wild-life. Bottom line, trade enforcement re-quires all hands on deck. If you boost trade enforcers at one agency only to wipe out the trade enforcers at an-other, you will fail to protect Amer-ican workers from unfair or illegal im-ports. So I will be looking closely at the budget that the President submits to determine whether he is serious about delivering real results on trade en-forcement or whether the campaign rhetoric and dramatic tweets are just a bunch of hot air, In recognition of the need for a new approach on trade enforcement, Con-gress recently passed new laws that give the President better tools to re-spond when trading partners don’t fol-low the rules. It also passed legislation to strengthen domestic laws that en-able the U.S. to unilaterally respond when American jobs are under threat, and it provided new direction should the President wish to negotiate new trade agreements or renegotiate past ones. In the coming months, I expect that those tools will not just sit and gather dust while the administration talks tough with respect to trade. It takes consistency, strategy and a lot of hard work to get trade done right. I have confidence that Robert Lighthizer will work to pursue a trade agenda that is coherent, constructive, and will deliver for American workers, and I will support his nomination. However, I want to express reserva-tion on one issue pertaining to this nominee. During his confirmation hearing, Senator S
TABENOW asked Mr. Lighthizer how he would deal with sit-uations in which he was conducting trade negotiations with a country in which the President has business inter-ests. Senator S
TABENOW wanted to make sure that the President’s per-sonal financial interests wouldn’t take precedence over the public interest. Mr. Lighthizer seemed surprised by the question, saying, quote, ‘‘the idea that this President would do anything unto-ward is . . . far out of the realm of pos-sibility.’’ I would like to put Mr. Lighthizer on notice. This is a legitimate issue, and I share Senator S
TABENOW ’s concern. Never before has this country faced a circumstance in which our trade rep-resentative will be negotiating trade agreements with countries in which the President or his family have active business interests, whether it is trade-marks, golf courses, or construction deals. I have introduced a bill requiring the President, when initiating trade negotiations, to disclose whether he has business interests in the country that we will be negotiating with. I in-tend to press this issue as trade nego-tiations move forward. Trade should be about fighting on behalf of American workers and businesses. It is not about the President’s bottom line. Finally, on an issue that has been closely related to this nomination, I want to commend several of my col-leagues for working together to provide relief to retired mineworkers regarding their healthcare costs. Senator M
ANCHIN has been a crusader on behalf of the mineworkers. Hardly a week went by over the last several months when I didn’t hear from J
OEMANCHIN  about how important it was to get the mineworkers the healthcare benefits they have earned. And he has worked hand-in-hand with Senators B
ROWN , C
ASEY , and W ARNER , all of whom serve on the Finance Committee. Chairman H
ATCH deserves thanks for working with us to get this across the finish line as well. I see that my good friend, Chairman H
ATCH , is here to make his remarks. I thank him for the cooperation he has shown. I think the interests of both sides in processing this nomination have been advanced. A lot could have gone awry here. We had challenges with getting the waiver Mr. Lighthizer needed. We needed the space to make sure the miners were protected. Members had strong views. I thank Chairman H
ATCH for the di-plomacy and cooperation he showed me and our side. I think that is why there was a very large vote for Mr. Lighthizer in the committee. I will be voting aye this afternoon and look forward to the Chairman’s wrap-up remarks. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Utah.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES2906 May 11, 2017 
Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, who is an excellent per-son to work with. We enjoy each other and enjoy working together. We are getting a lot done, and I appreciate his kind remarks here today. I rise today in support of the nomina-tion of Robert Lighthizer to be the next United States Trade Representa-tive. Mr. Lighthizer was reported out of the Finance Committee unani-mously—Democrats and Republicans— and I hope he receives a similarly strong bipartisan vote here on the floor. By statute, Congress has designated the USTR as the primary official for developing and coordinating U.S. trade policy, advising the President on trade, and leading international trade nego-tiations. The USTR must also report directly to and consult closely with Congress on a wide range of issues af-fecting international commerce. The USTR is Congress’s first and most im-portant point of contact when it comes to trade policy. Therefore, in order for Congress to have an effective voice in shaping our Nation’s trade agenda, we need to have a fully staffed and func-tional USTR office. For that reason, I have been very critical of the pointless and unprece-dented delays we have faced in filling this vacancy, in filling this position, due to some unreasonable demands from some of my friends on the other side of the aisle. This delay has served only to weaken Congress’s position in trade policy and has hampered our ability to provide the new administra-tion with substantive input. Despite this ill-advised delay, I am pleased that Mr. Lighthizer’s nomination has fi-nally been brought to the floor, and I thank my colleagues for that. Mr. Lighthizer’s years of experience in public service, including as staff di-rector for the Senate Finance Com-mittee, as Deputy USTR during the Reagan administration, and in private practice, make him extremely well qualified to serve as our Nation’s rep-resentative. Mr. Lighthizer’s knowl-edge and experience will be vital to his service in this position and vital to our country. Put simply, growing our economy and creating better paying jobs for American workers require increased U.S. trade. Toward that end, I have spoken to Mr. Lighthizer about the im-portance of removing trade barriers for American businesses, workers, con-sumers, and, where those barriers have already been removed, maintaining the status quo. I know there is quite a bit of discus-sion going around about potential changes to the North American Free Trade Agreement. As I told Mr. Lighthizer, there are definitely oppor-tunities to update and improve NAFTA, but it is important that the administration follow the spirit of the Hippocratic Oath: First do no harm. Mr. Lighthizer and I have also dis-cussed the importance of protecting U.S. intellectual property rights around the globe through strong en-forcement and better rules in trade agreements. I believe he recognizes the importance of this priority, and I will work to ensure that this issue plays a prominent role in our future trade ne-gotiations. I have also made clear to Mr. Lighthizer that I believe consultation on trade policy between Congress and the administration is essential, par-ticularly if our agreements are going to adhere to the standards Congress put forward in the Bipartisan Congres-sional Trade Priorities and Account-ability Act of 2015, the statute that in-cluded the most recent reauthorization of trade promotion authority. On this key point, I believe Mr. Lighthizer and I are in agreement. As U.S. Trade Representative, Mr. Lighthizer will have the task of hold-ing our trading partners accountable, ensuring that Americans don’t pay more for the products their families need and helping American businesses and workers sell more of their goods and services around the globe. This is not an easy job, but I am con-fident that Mr. Lighthizer is up to the task. As chairman of the Senate com-mittee with jurisdiction over our Na-tion’s trade policy, I am committed to working with him to ensure that we advance a trade agenda that will grow our economy, create more jobs, and ex-pand market access around the globe for America’s farmers, ranchers, and manufacturers. Mr. President, I suggest we vote on Mr. Lighthizer. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. All postcloture time has expired. The question is, Will the Senate ad-vise and consent to the Lighthizer nomination? Mr. WICKER. I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?

RUSSIA INVESTIGATION  
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, there is a saying, an old adage, that history doesn’t repeat, but it rhymes. Over the past week, the dramatic fir-ing of James Comey has recalled past events—history that involved one of the major scandals in our Nation’s past—the Watergate scandal. In Watergate, the saying originated— another very common saying—that the coverup is worse than the crime. The danger now in the United States—the greatest country in the history of the world, with the most effective and fair justice on our planet—is that, in fact, there may be a coverup, and that the truth will be stifled, and people who should be held accountable will not be. That is the danger. In this instance, in comparison to Watergate, actually, the crime is ex-traordinarily serious. In Watergate, there was a two-bit break-in or bur-glary, and the coverup, in fact, in-volved obstruction of justice. What we have here is a deliberate, purposeful as-sault on our American democracy by the Russians through a cyber attack that involved, really, in effect, an act of war—a combination of cyber, propa-ganda, and misinformation spread de-liberately; it involved hacking into both major parties and the spread of the results of that hacking for one of those parties—possibly influencing the outcome of the election. The issue of whether and how the outcome of that election may have

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2907 May 11, 2017 
been influenced will be discussed and contended through the annals of his-tory. Regardless of your point of view on what the impact was, the fact is, the criminal action by the Russians interfering with our election must be investigated aggressively and impar-tially, and the Russians, and anyone who aided and abetted them, must be held accountable. That is what the American people want. They want the truth uncovered, and they want to hold accountable anyone who colluded with the Russians in this attack on our Na-tion, anyone who aided and abetted or assisted them, anyone who bears a re-sponsibility and should be held crimi-nally culpable. The Watergate scandal was eventu-ally successfully prosecuted. It took years to do so. The appointment of a special prosecutor was key to that ef-fort. In fact, Elliott Richardson was not only requested, he was required to appoint a special prosecutor as a condi-tion of his confirmation. He was spe-cifically directed by the Judiciary Committee of the U.S. Senate, and he agreed to do so. Archibald Cox was ap-pointed, and then President Nixon fired Elliott Richardson as well as his dep-uty, William Ruckelshaus, because they refused to dismiss Archibald Cox. The principle here—the rhyming of history if not its repeating—is that sometimes investigations come so close to power and the truth about the power that there is an effort to stifle them. Watergate involved a two-bit bur-glary. This crime involves the theft of our democracy by the Russians and by others who may have colluded with him. So a successful investigation here goes to the fundamental principle that our elections will be free and credible, that they will be honest, without for-eign interference or meddling by any-one. The firing of James Comey as FBI Di-rector is reminiscent of what happened with the dismissal of two Attorneys General and then a special prosecutor because it raises the possibility that an investigation will be catastrophically compromised and undermined by the President of the United States. Just last week, I asked James Comey whether the President of the United States might currently be a target of the criminal investigation. Director Comey would not and could not rule out that possibility because he cannot speak about targets freely and openly, but we know some of the individuals implicated are close associates of the Trump campaign, including Michael Flynn, Carter Page, Roger Stone, and Paul Manafort. Each had different roles; for example, Paul Manafort was a leader of the campaign. We know that subpoenas have been issued from a grand jury in the Eastern District of New York for materials re-lating to Michael Flynn and to his as-sociates. We know that then-Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates went to the White House and warned that he might be vulnerable to blackmail be-cause he had lied to the Vice President. We know also that very possibly he lied to the FBI. He deceptively omitted from materials or responses he gave in his security clearance information about payments to him from the Rus-sians and the Turkish Government and that he may have committed other very serious violations of criminal law, punishable by years in prison. That in-vestigation is ongoing now. As I speak on the floor of the U.S. Senate, my hope is that agents of the FBI are doing their work, as they have done for decades, with integrity and de-termination and dedication. I know the work the FBI does, having worked with them as the U.S. Attorney in Con-necticut. It is not only one of our pre-mier law enforcement agencies, there is none finer in the world. I have con-fidence that they will continue this in-vestigation successfully, meaning that they will achieve a just result, if there is the right leadership. That is why I believe now there is no question that an independent special prosecutor must be appointed. There is no longer any doubt that an inde-pendent special prosecutor is necessary for the appearance and credibility, the appearance of integrity, and the credi-bility and objectivity of this investiga-tion. The different contradictory stories surrounding the firing of James Comey emphasizes this point. Initially, the de-cision was made by Rod Rosenstein as Deputy Attorney General, but of course it involved also the Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, who never should have been involved because he was recused from the investigation. The reason given by Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein involved the Hil-lary Clinton emails and statements made by Jim Comey 10 months ago—an explanation that defied belief, a pre-tense that was laughable and especially unfortunate—even tragic—from a ca-reer professional prosecutor like Rod Rosenstein. Well, that explanation now has been supplanted; in fact, as recently as this morning, in an interview the President gave to Lester Holt of NBC, acknowl-edging that he made the decision be-cause he had lost faith in Jim Comey. Never mind that he reaffirmed that faith shortly after his inaugural. Never mind that he praised Jim Comey on the campaign trail. His reasons for dis-missing Jim Comey also defy belief. This set of incidents shakes to the core the trust all of us should have in our justice system, in the integrity of our public officials, in the capability of that system to uncover the truth and hold accountable anyone who has vio-lated the law. President Trump has now fired not one but two high-ranking Justice offi-cials after they told him about sus-picions that he or his associates have broken the law; first, Sally Yates and now Director Comey. Attorney General Sessions has shown through his role in the Comey firing that even after he has recused himself from an investigation, he will help the President punish Justice Department officials who are pushing that inves-tigation forward. Maybe most disappointing, Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein—the man now responsible for the Trump-Russia investigation—has permitted himself to become a pawn in President Trump’s game. His credibility and integrity may well have been irredeemably sac-rificed. The only way for him to restore it now is to appoint a special pros-ecutor. That power is his alone. The rules and regulations of the Depart-ment of Justice not only permit it, in my view, the standards of ethics re-quire it because he now is irrevocably conflicted. President Trump, Attorney General Sessions, and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein want Americans to be-lieve Comey was fired because he pub-licly discussed his investigation into Hillary Clinton. That kind of state-ment betrays contempt for the intel-ligence of the American people because we remember President Trump ap-plauding Director Comey’s decision to discuss the Clinton investigation. He even used his letter firing Director Comey to publicly discuss the details of an FBI investigation, saying he has been told three times that he is not under investigation—albeit details I find very hard to believe. He has called this investigation a charade. He has called the allegations of Russia meddling and Trump associ-ates’ collusion with it a hoax. He has belittled and demeaned not only the judges of our Federal bench, but, by implication, the hard-working men and women of the FBI who are doing an in-vestigation which he says is ‘‘a tax-payer-funded charade.’’ That statement is a disservice to the FBI—a non-political, nonpartisan law enforcement agency without superior in the world. They deserve and need a special pros-ecutor who can lead them in this mo-ment of crisis. Make no mistake, we face a looming constitutional crisis. The case of United States v. Nixon, which involved enforcement of subpoenas against the President, is no longer a matter of idle speculation; it is a real possibility. What the FBI also needs now are re-sources to make sure this investigation is conducted fairly, impartially, objec-tively, and independently, with suffi-cient agents, staff, and other support. In fact, in my view, one of the precipi-tating factors in the firing of James Comey was his going to the Deputy At-torney General and asking for more re-sources. As a prosecutor, I know re-sources are the lifeblood of a successful investigation. An investigation de-prived of resources cannot reach a just result; it will be strangled, stifled, and stopped. And that is clearly the pur-pose of some in this administration, perhaps because it is coming close to people whom they want to protect.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES2908 May 11, 2017 
Congress can and must use every tool at our disposal to make sure the inves-tigation of the Trump administration’s and campaign’s ties to Russia and the potential ongoing coverup of those ties is affirmed. The true and independent special prosecutor is the only one who can assure. Our Intelligence Commit-tees can produce findings and rec-ommendations. An independent com-mission, which I support, can hold hearings in public and also produce a report. But only a special prosecutor can bring criminal charges and hold ac-countable anyone and everyone who should bear a price. On both sides of the aisle, we have said the Russians must pay a price or they will do again in 2018 what they did in 2016, but so should the people who aided and abetted and colluded with them. If they fail to pay a price, they will do it again, too, corrupting our system, undermining the rule of law, and imperiling our democracy. If the President continues to object to an independent investigation or spe-cial prosecutor, people of good will on both sides of the aisle must stand up to him and demand one. I am encouraged by some of what my Republican col-leagues have told me over the last 24 hours. I believe we are at a rhyming mo-ment when the integrity of our justice system and our democracy is at stake. People, regardless of their political af-filiation, owe it to our democracy to come forward, to recognize the gravity of this moment, and to stand up and speak out. I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will do so. We may disagree about a lot of things, but on this point, we should agree fundamentally. Part of our obli-gation is to call before us Deputy At-torney General Rod Rosenstein and, separately, Attorney General Jeff Ses-sions, as well as former FBI Director Jim Comey, to hear from them their views of this tragic and terrifying epi-sode in our history. This firing must be a subject for our investigation. We owe it to the American people. I thank my colleagues in advance for proving that this investigation is no charade. It is no hoax. It is deadly seri-ous, and the failure to appoint an inde-pendent prosecutor could be deadly to our democracy. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Louisiana. 
HEALTHCARE LEGISLATION  
Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, before us as the Senate right now, aside from issues Mr. B
LUMENTHAL referred to, is the repeal and replacement of the Af-fordable Care Act. I am a physician, and I have been practicing in hospitals for the unin-sured for the last 25 years. I would like to in one sense say that gives me spe-cial standing to speak about this issue, but in reality, it does not. Senator M
ORAN from Kansas spoke up the other day at our lunch. He said that healthcare is like no other issue. He spoke of a friend of his approaching him at church with tears rolling down her face. Her mother had a preexisting condition, and she was so concerned that we get this right. I don’t need to say I have special standing, being a physician. We all have special standing from living, hav-ing families and friends who—sooner or later, healthcare will affect the family. The Affordable Care Act for many is not working. Premiums are going sky high. Two or 3 days ago, I had communica-tion with someone from San Francisco. Her young family has a $20,000-a-year premium, a $6,000 deductible for each member of the family—in San Fran-cisco, already paying so much for hous-ing, food, and transportation, and $20,000 on top of that for a family of relatively modest income. Then I spoke to someone in Wash-ington, DC. His family’s premium is $24,000; they have a $13,000 deductible. He said: I am out $37,000 before my in-surance kicks in. I reassured him that his colonoscopy would be for free. I don’t think he thought that funny. Then a friend of mine who last year in Louisiana—his quote for a policy for himself and his wife, 60 and 61, was $39,000 for 1 year—$39,000 for 1 year— with a deductible. Now we are being told there will be premium increases this coming year. In Connecticut, they just announced they are going to be 15 to 35 percent higher. In my own State, I have been told they may approach 30 to 40 percent higher, although that is not definite. The reality is that premiums have become unaffordable. President Trump campaigned on this. There were four things he told the American people. He said he wanted to cover all, care for those with preexisting conditions, eliminate the Affordable Care Act mandates that people hate so much, and lower premiums. I would like to say I think it is part of President Trump’s intuitive genius. Whatever you say about the fellow, he certainly has an intuition sometimes about how things work. Of course, the way you would lower premiums is that you would cover all, and by covering all, you expand the risk pool, which then lowers premiums for those with preexisting conditions but keeps them lower for the rest of us. Folks ask how you can do that with-out mandates, and I say you can do it through the mechanism of the Cassidy- Collins plan, the Patient Freedom Act, which is to say you have an auto-en-rollment feature. By the way, here is President Trump. He said it many times, but here he is in the Washington Post on January 15, 2017, just before he takes the oath of of-fice: ‘‘We’re going to have insurance for every-body,’’ Trump said. ‘‘There was a philosophy in some circles that if you can’t pay for it, you don’t get it. That’s not going to happen with us.’’ 
You cannot have a stronger state-ment from a fellow who is about to rise to be inaugurated and gives a speech in which he speaks passionately about the forgotten man and the forgotten woman. President Trump pledged to re-member them. The question is, How do you lower premiums? How do you fulfill President Trump’s goals? There are several ways to lower pre-miums. I just described one, where you fulfill the other parts of his contract with the voter, which is you cover all, and by doing so, you increase the size of the risk pool, and therefore you lower premiums. There is another mechanism. You can put in price trans-parency and do other things to lower the cost of medical care, which in turn lowers the cost of healthcare pre-miums. But there is one way which is not so good. One way that you can lower cost is to have a crummy policy that hardly covers anything. You think you are getting a deal in the front end because premiums are low, and then you or someone in your family gets sick, and it is not such a great deal after all. I was asked about this on a Sunday morning show and spontaneously came up with something called the Kimmel test. Jimmy Kimmel, the late-night co-median, spoke of his son being born. We can all imagine—this happened 2 weeks ago—his child was born. I sus-pect somebody is videoing it. It is going to be a moment of celebration. As the child emerges and everybody wants to lean forward and hand the child to the mother and the father to hold and cuddle, instead, the doctor and the nurse notice that the child is blue—‘‘blue’’ meaning he is not getting enough oxygen. It is quickly realized that something is profoundly wrong. Instead of mother and father hugging and bonding with the child, they are pushed to the side. They hear a code blue call, which means this child will die if something is not done imme-diately. I was not there, but I have been in similar situations. They are being asked to sign forms which would allow this child—their child whom they have not yet held—to be transported by helicopter across Los Angeles to have emergency surgery that day and being told that if they do not sign this form, that child will die. Now, Jimmy Kimmel pointed out that he is a millionaire, he could afford it, but he also pointed out: Others, not so much. I think that brings us back to what President Trump said. President Trump said: ‘‘We’re going to have insurance for every-body. There was a philosophy in some circles that if you can’t pay for it, you don’t get it. That’s not going to happen with us.’’ 
The Jimmy Kimmel test: We will protect those with preexisting condi-tions, but we will do it by lowering pre-miums and not by giving crummy cov-erage but, rather, by having adequate coverage. So if our approach passes the Kimmel test, then we feel it is a way to go.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2909 May 11, 2017 
Now, how do we go from here? We can recognize that premiums are too high for middle-class families. They can no longer afford it, and that is before the premium increases, which are about to occur. I will also say that as to the way the Affordable Care Act was passed—not blaming or praising anyone—that only one party was engaged is not the path forward. History says that any time there is significant social legislation that has an enduring effect in the United States, both parties engage. I want this to change. I would chal-lenge my Democratic colleagues to be-come engaged. Some have said: Oh, my gosh, Republicans are doing this through reconciliation; isn’t that ter-rible? I would say it presents opportunity. We don’t need 12 Democrats; we don’t need 8 Democrats. We could have three Democrats or four Democrats. Anyone who cares enough about the people in their State and their premiums, which are rising 20 to 40 percent a year, will put aside all the pressure from a polit-ical base and say: The people of my State are more important than the po-litical pressure I may feel. They will step forward to influence the final product. We know that if folks come in from the other side of the aisle, we will have a different product than if it is only among Republicans. If Republicans had participated in the passage of the Af-fordable Care Act, we would have had something perhaps a little different than the Affordable Care Act. I am not pointing fingers. I am just observing that it would only take three or four Democrats to break ranks, to step across the aisle, and to ask for what they would need. This is not: You come to us, and you don’t get it—no. We have a meeting of the minds so that we can come to the policy that fulfills President Trump’s pledge—his pledge to cover all, caring for those with pre-existing conditions, eliminating man-dates, and lowering premiums. We have an incredible opportunity before us to bring relief to those mid-dle-class couples struggling with pre-miums that they can no longer afford and deductibles that they will never meet. If they don’t meet and can’t af-ford them and if they do not purchase the insurance, they are being fined and are accumulating resentment toward Washington because they are stuck with this. We can address that issue and at the same time fulfill President Trump’s pledge that all will have cov-erage. Some said you can’t get it if you can’t pay, but that is not going to be the case with us. It will provide them that coverage with something that passes the Kimmel test. I look forward to working with our Senate to come to this solution. I yield back. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Virginia. Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I am proud to take the floor, and I am espe-cially proud to take the floor after my colleague from Louisiana, whom I be-lieve has offered a very good-faith pro-posal, both in the specifics of the bill that he has introduced but also in his encouragement that Democrats should participate together with Republicans as the Senate takes up the House- passed American Health Care Act. I do applaud my colleague, and I find much in his presentation to support. I find some points of difference, which I will get into, but much to support. I am strongly opposed to the House- passed American Health Care Act, TrumpCare. I found that one of the sets of reasons really crystalized yesterday. The Democrats had a hearing, and we invited patients to come from around the country to talk about their healthcare experiences. There were six witnesses in the hear-ing. One was a Virginian, a man named Michael Dunkley, from Alexandria. His story was a common one but a tough one. He has been the caretaker for his wife, who has had multiple sclerosis for many years and then got diagnosed with cancer. He talked about trying to deal with being a full-time caregiver for a wife with multiple sclerosis and dealing with cancer before the Afford-able Care Act and the unsustainable cost that it led to with his family. But after the Affordable Care Act, he was able to afford coverage for himself and his wife. We heard from a mother from Indi-ana whose daughter was born with Down syndrome and how the medical bills connected to her child’s treatment forced her, first, to stop working be-cause she needed to be a full-time care-giver. She described the pain of cuddling her newborn in her arms and going to the mailbox and pulling out a $64,000 bill and knowing that this is what the rest of my life is going to be like and the rest of my child’s life. Then she talked about how her family got relief because of the Affordable Care Act. We heard from a witness who has multiple sclerosis, a woman who is now a substitute teacher. Because the State she lived in, Texas, didn’t expand Med-icaid, she had to move to another State because she couldn’t afford health in-surance to deal with a medical prob-lem. So she chose to move to a State that had done Medicaid expansion, Maryland. We heard other stories as well. These were painful stories. (Mr. CASSIDY assumed the Chair.) I say to the Presiding Officer, I give you credit for modesty. You are too modest. You do have an expertise in this. You do understand this. You have heard these stories before, and I had heard some of them, too, even without a medical expertise. What I found so troubling—and during the testimony of this mother from Indiana about her child with Down syndrome, I could feel tears rolling down my face—was this. I had heard stories like this before, but what struck me was that the House voted on this bill without caring about any of these stories, without listening to any of these stories, without allow-ing a process to address any of these stories. I blurted out: The folks who voted for this bill in the House don’t care about the challenges you are fac-ing. They don’t care about this or they would have listened to you. I beg my Senate colleagues to treat this differently, to treat it seriously, to take these stories seriously, and to work together. I hope the Senate takes a different course on this. Let me explain what I mean when I say the House Members who voted for this didn’t care about these people and the challenges they were facing. When the House bill was taken up, there was a version of the bill taken up before March 24, and there were three hear-ings held. At those hearings—at two of the hearings—no patients were invited to speak. Nobody representing patients was invited to speak. One of the hearings had one witness from the American Cancer Society and one witness who was a State insurance commissioner. Now, that bill came to nothing on March 24, and the bill was rewritten. It was the rewritten bill that was passed by the House. There were no hearings on the rewritten bill. There were no hearings. There were no oppor-tunities for patients to talk about the bill and what it would mean to them. There were no Democratic amendments that were accepted. No patients or pro-viders were given any opportunity to share their concerns in a hearing or in formal discussion about the bill. No ex-pert witnesses were allowed to testify about the bill. The House rushed to pass the bill without a CBO score—the Congres-sional Budget Office—which would have said what would have been the premium effect on people, how many people would have lost insurance, and were folks with preexisting conditions going to be covered or not. The House rushed to pass it before the score came about. When they passed it by the narrow margin of 217 to 213, they boarded a bus and went to the White House and had a big celebration. It was the kind of cele-bration that happens at the White House when they invite the Super Bowl winning team or the NCAA football champions to come to the White House. It was a celebration. Imagine if you are the mom with a kid with Down syndrome and you are getting a $64,000 bill in the mail and you are saying: This is what the rest of my life is going to be like. And the House passes a bill without listening to you, that by some estimates could take health insurance away from 24 million people and could reimpose deep pen-alties on folks if they have preexisting conditions. And you watch people cele-brating that—celebrating it like it is a sports victory? This is what I found so very troubling during the hearing yesterday—these

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES2910 May 11, 2017 
folks’ stories, which are not the only stories to be told about the Affordable Care Act. There are good stories. There are challenging stories. But the stories weren’t even important enough for the House to even listen to them. I do think the Senate process should be different. Where I am going to disagree slightly with the comments you made is that I am going to compare that process in the House to the process that was un-dertaken in Congress before the Afford-able Care Act was passed in 2010, be-cause sometimes it is said: Well, that was just a one-party thing. Actually, that is not the case. In 2009, before the Affordable Care Act passed, the Senate Finance Committee held not one or two hearings. No, 53 hear-ings on health reform were held. The committee spent 8 days marking up the legislation, which is the longest mark-up in 22 years, and it considered 135 amendments. In the Finance Committee, the then- Democratic chair, Senator Baucus, worked for months with a bipartisan group of three Democrats and three Re-publicans trying to find a compromise on healthcare reform. While they couldn’t find a compromise ultimately on the floor vote, Democrats and Re-publicans wrote the bill together and considered amendments in that com-mittee offered by both Democrats and Republicans. The HELP Committee, where you and I serve, was every bit as active. They had an additional 47 bipartisan hearings, roundtables, and walk- throughs on health insurance. HELP considered hundreds of amendments during a monthlong markup, which is one of the longest in congressional his-tory, and many Republican amend-ments were accepted as part of the process. When the bill came from the two committees to the Senate floor in 2010, the final Senate bill that was passed in this Chamber included not one or two, not a few dozen but 147 amendments that were proposed by Republicans. This bill, the Affordable Care Act, was shaped by the Republicans. The Republicans decided, for their own reasons, to vote against the final product, but they offered amendments in good faith—147 of them were accept-ed. The Senate spent 25 days consecu-tively in session on healthcare reform, the second longest consecutive session in history. The House did something similar in 2009: bipartisan hearings, 100 hours of hearings, and 181 witnesses from both sides testifying. Some 239 amendments were considered, and 121 by both Demo-crats and Republicans were adopted. Again, in the House on the floor, there were no House Republican votes, but the bill was shaped by Republicans, amended by Republicans. There was a process that included two parties. I would suggest to you that the dif-ference in the processes—an ACA proc-ess that included hearings, hearing from patients, the opportunities to have committee hearings, the opportu-nities for both parties to amend—led to a situation in 2010 where many stake-holder groups supported the Affordable Care Act: the American Medical Asso-ciation, the AARP, the American Hos-pital Association, and numerous other groups, providers, consumers, busi-nesses, and other groups. Compare that to what is the level of support for the bill as it passed out of the House. Patients oppose this bill: the American Association of People with Disabilities, AARP, the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Net-work, the American Diabetes Associa-tion, the American Heart Association, the American Lung Association, the American Public Health Association, the American Society of Hematology, the Children’s Defense Fund, Families USA, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, the National Breast Cancer Coalition, the Muscular Dystrophy Association, the National Disability Rights Center, the National Multiple Sclerosis Soci-ety, and the National Organization for Rare Disorders. All of these groups rep-resent patients. All of these groups op-pose the House bill that contained no input from patients and no meaningful bipartisan process. Doctors and nurses oppose the House bill: the American Medical Associa-tion, the American Nursing Associa-tion, the American Osteopathic Asso-ciation, the American Academy of Pe-diatrics, the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American Con-gress of Obstetricians and Gyne-cologists, the American College of Phy-sicians, the American College of Rheumatology. Hospitals oppose the House bill: America’s Essential Hospitals, the American Hospital Association, and the Federation of American Hospitals. There are groups fighting for wom-en’s health access: the National Family Planning & Reproductive Health Asso-ciation and Planned Parenthood. All of these groups oppose the bill that came out of the House without pa-tient input, without a meaningful com-mittee process, without the ability of Democrats to offer amendments. Mr. President, I think that points us to a lesson, and I do think it is the same lesson that you spoke about a few minutes ago. Democrats have called for a transparent and bipartisan process to engage in fixes to the Affordable Care Act. I had been on the committee with you no less than a week. I have been trying to get on the HELP Committee since I came into the Senate. I finally achieved my goal in January, and with-in a week or 10 days of being on com-mittee, I led a group of 13 Democrats. We wrote to our chair, L
AMAR ALEX-
ANDER , the Finance chair, O RRIN H
ATCH , and the Senate majority leader, M
ITCH MCCONNELL , and said that we are ready to sit down and talk about improvements and fixes. I say to the Presiding Officer, my heart soared when I read your com-ment last week: Any final bill must fulfill President Trump’s promises to lower premiums, maintain coverage, and ensure protection for those with preexisting conditions—the same items that you put up on your board just a few minutes ago—because that is the same set of three goals I have. That is the same set of three goals, I think, all my colleagues have. If we can hold that up as the stand-ard, we will work on a bill together, and the bill should meet three prom-ises: to maintain coverage so people don’t lose, to maintain costs so people don’t pay more, and to maintain com-passion so those with preexisting con-ditions aren’t kicked to the curb. If we can find that bill, we will do it as Democrats and Republicans. We will do it in a way that we can build some-thing that will last. I agree with you on this point. But I deeply believe this: No bill will achieve those aims if it is purely done by one party. No bill will achieve those aims if it is cooked up and put on the floor without a meaningful committee process in HELP and Finance, without hearing from expert witnesses, without hearing from stakeholders, without hearing from patients, without hearing the kinds of stories we heard yester-day. If we wall ourselves off from the public presentation of this kind of in-formation as we are grappling with the most important spending decision any-one ever makes in their life, as we are grappling with the largest sector of the American economy, if we just rush to get this to the floor and try to make it a one-party product, we will not achieve the three pillars that you and I share and that President Trump has promised to the American public. So this is my hope. We want to work together, and the right way to work to-gether is this: Send the House bill or a preferable bill, if you have it—your bill or a consensus bill that the group of 12 on the Republican side has. Put that bill in the two committees. Why not have this bill in the HELP Committee and the Finance Committee? Why not hear from patients and doctors and hospitals and nurses and insurance companies and small businesses that struggle to buy insurance for their em-ployees? Let’s hear from some expert witnesses about what they like about the status quo or like about the new proposals, what they don’t like about them, and how we can fix them. Give us the opportunity to ask some ques-tions. Give us the opportunity to offer some amendments, hopefully some bi-partisan amendments, to make this better. Let’s treat this at least with the seriousness it was treated in 2009. You are right to critique that the final vote—save the vote of Arlen Spec-ter, who at the time he voted was a Democrat—that the final vote was par-tisan. You are right to critique that. We would want to go beyond that, but we can’t go backward. We can’t elimi-nate the opportunity for public input, eliminate the opportunity for com-mittee action and amendments. We

should be doing that in a full and ro-bust way. So I just stand on the floor today to say amen to the boards that you put up there—amen to those three pillars that should be the test of the work that we do in this body—and to pledge that if you put this in the committees where we serve and we have the opportunity to work together, that is the most nat-ural place for us to work in a trans-parent and bipartisan way. To ask Democratic Members just to cross the aisle to work on something that will be rushed to the floor with no committee process—that is not really engagement; that is not really mean-ingful. But putting it in committees, where we can do our work in the light of day and hear from people like Mi-chael Dunkley and the mother from In-diana and do it with the American pub-lic watching—now that is engagement. I guarantee if we do that, we will get to a better result, a result that will be better for people, a result that will be more likely to meet your criteria and mine, and a result that will be more likely to last.

ALL-SENATORS BRIEFINGS  
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, before the Senate adjourns for the weekend, I wish to address a few things related to the dismissal of FBI Director James Comey. The story coming out of the White House about why Mr. Comey was fired continues to change and there are no good explanations for the change. For 2 days, the White House implied that the decision to fire Mr. Comey ei-ther originated or was largely influ-enced by the recommendations from the Deputy Attorney General and the Attorney General. The Vice President of the United States spoke to reporters here on Capitol Hill and said that it was the President’s ‘‘decision to accept the recommendation of the Deputy At-torney General and the Attorney Gen-eral to remove Director Comey.’’ Those accounts, by the spokespeople of the President and the Vice President himself, were just blatantly and com-pletely contradicted by the President himself on national television. President Trump told NBC News that it was his decision to fire Mr. Comey, and he had made up his mind to do so before hearing from either the Attor-ney General or the Deputy Attorney General, in direct contradiction to what his own Vice President and his own press people were saying. Well, which one was it? Did the Vice President mislead the public or did the President? When was the decision made to fire Mr. Comey, and what was the reason? And why did it take so long for the White House to get its story straight? These are all critical questions, and the American people deserve answers. We need to understand the true nature of the events that led to Director Comey’s dismissal, why it happened, and what it means for the investiga-tion into the potential collusion be-tween the Trump campaign and Russia as we move forward. This morning, I made a request of the majority leader to call an all-Senators briefing with Attorney General Ses-sions and Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein. Given the events of this week, and particularly after what the President said this afternoon, a brief-ing from these two officials before the whole Senate, where Senators from both parties can ask and get answers to the serious questions hanging over us, is imperative for this body and for the American people. The all-Senators briefing with the Attorney General and the Deputy Attorney General should be separate and partially classified, if nec-essary. The need for these briefings is even greater now than it was this morning, given what the President said this afternoon. The rule of law, the separa-tion of powers, and their strength— hallmarks of American democracy—are at stake. Now, I have just heard from the ma-jority leader that he will invite Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to an all-Senators briefing next week. I asked the majority leader to do the briefing early in the week. It is a good first step, and I thank the majority leader for consenting to this request. Mr. Rosenstein was here on the Hill today meeting with Members. He re-quested to meet with me, and I said I wanted to meet with him along with my 99 colleagues so Members of both parties were given the opportunity to question him. I am glad he has a will-ingness to come talk to Congress, and I hope he will accept our bipartisan in-vitation from Leader M
CCONNELL and from me to brief the entire Senate next week. My caucus still believes that Attor-ney General Sessions must be made available to the Senate in a similar ca-pacity, given his reported role in firing Director Comey and helping select his replacement. Considering his recusal from the Russia investigation, his close involvement in these events warrants the Senate’s questioning as well, but I thank the majority leader for trying to set up the briefing with Mr. Rosen-stein. It is very likely, I believe, that it will happen, just pending Mr. Rosen-stein’s consent, and I hope the major-ity leader soon comes to the right deci-sion and grants our request to question Mr. Sessions as well. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. BLUNT ). Without objection, it is so or-dered. 
REMEMBERING LEO THORSNESS  
Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, I am speaking tomorrow at an Air Force ROTC commissioning ceremony at the University of Arkansas. As I have been preparing my remarks, I have been thinking a lot about the airmen who have left more than contrails behind them—the men and women who served with such distinction that we still re-member them to this day, those great Americans, the heroes of the sky. The first name that came to mind, the name that resounded louder than almost any other is the great Leo Thorsness, so you can imagine how saddened I was to hear about his pass-ing last week. Whenever you hear such a legend has left the Earth, it is like a sudden crack of thunder in the dead of night. It wakes you up. It sobers you. It reminds you of what we have lost be-cause Leo Thorsness was an American classic. Born in Walnut Grove, MN, his child-hood sounds as idyllic as his home-town. He joined the Boy Scouts and later rose to become an Eagle Scout. He met his wife Gaylee in the freshman registration line at South Dakota State College. They married 3 years later and had one daughter, Dawn. He joined the Air Force, went to flying school, and became a pilot. Soon, he was a fighter pilot in both the Strategic and Tactical Air Com-mands. Looking back on his life, we can see Leo Thorsness was part of an era—those burly, self-confident, mid-dle-class families who, after the Great Depression and the greatest of wars, put down roots and built the booming America of the mid to late 20th cen-tury. Of course, Leo was not simply a part of his generation; he inspired it with his courage and self-sacrifice. For many Americans, the only number they remember from the Vietnam years is their draft number. But for Leo Thorsness, there are two numbers that stick out: 88 and 93. It was on his 88th mission for the Air Force that he performed the noble deeds for which he would later receive the Medal of Honor. He was flying an F–105 Thunderchief with his weapons specialist, Harold Johnson. They were escorting fighter bombers targeting a North Vietnamese army barracks. They shot down a MIG, roughed up an-other, and hit two missile batteries. They were low on ammo and fuel, but they fought on. He continued to scare off MIGs and instructed a tanker plane to refuel another fighter. When he fi-nally landed 70 miles south in Thai-land, the fuel tank was on empty. It was a stunning act of bravery. It was on his 93rd mission, just seven shy of completing his tour of duty,

that Leo Thorsness was shot down. He was captured and spent 6 years in the ‘‘Hanoi Hilton’’—6 years in the dark-ness. It was there that he met his cell-mate, our colleague and future Sen-ator, J
OHNMCCAIN. Imagining 6 days in such a terrible place is more than most people can handle, never mind 6 years. But Leo Thorsness endured; he saw the mission through. When he returned in 1973, it was to an astonished and grateful na-tion, but the man himself was unfazed. He called his wife after being released and said: ‘‘I would have called sooner, but I’ve been all tied up.’’ He later went on to serve in the Washington State Senate and run for other offices. But his legacy is not one of the titles he won; it is the example he set. He was quite a man, Leo Thorsness. And though we have lost him, we will keep his memory for a good long time to come. Leo Thorsness, rest in peace. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.

NOMINATION OF MARK GREEN Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as rank-ing member of the Appropriations Sub-committee on the Department of State and Foreign Operations, I welcome the nomination of Ambassador and former Member of Congress Mark Green to be the next Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development. Ambassador Green brings a wealth of experience to this important position. He has been president of the Inter-national Republican Institute since 2014. In 2013, he was president and chief executive officer of the Initiative for Global Development, and before that, he served as senior director at the U.S. Global Leadership Coalition, a network of 400 businesses, nongovernmental or-ganizations, policy experts, and others supporting the role of development in U.S. foreign policy. He served as the U.S. Ambassador to Tanzania from 2007 to 2009. While there, he led a mission of more than 350 Americans and Tanza-nians and was ultimately responsible for some of the largest U.S. overseas development programs. Prior to his serving as U.S. Ambassador, Mark Green served four terms in the U.S. House of Representatives, representing Wisconsin’s 8th District. Ambassador Green also served on the board of directors of the Millennium Challenge Corporation, after being ap-pointed to that position by President Obama. He is currently on the Human Freedom Advisory Council for the George W. Bush Institute and cochairs the Consensus for Development Re-form, a coalition of policy and business leaders devising new principles for making development policy more effec-tive and growth-oriented. He is a board member of WorldTeach and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. Since 1989, as either chairman or ranking member of the subcommittee that provides the funding for USAID’s operations and programs, I know the critical role that it plays in promoting and protecting U.S. interests around the world. Its field missions are its greatest strength, and countless lives have been saved, conflicts avoided, and government institutions strengthened, thanks to the global health, social and economic development, and democracy programs administered by USAID. These programs are not charity. They are essential and complementary to the roles played by our diplomats and soldiers. President Trump has talked about ‘‘America First.’’ We all want this country to be the best it can be, but slogans are not a substitute for effec-tive policies. Creating jobs at home is not, by itself, a foreign policy. The United States cannot remain a leader in the global economy, where the gravest security problems we face can only be solved by working with other countries, if we reduce our engagement with the world. The vacuum we leave will quickly be filled by our competi-tors, and it will be difficult if not im-possible to recover lost ground. At a time when OMB is proposing to slash USAID’s budget and downgrade its overseas presence, the nomination of Ambassador Green is a positive sig-nal. If confirmed, I look forward to working with him and subcommittee Chairman G
RAHAM , as well as with our House appropriations subcommittee counterparts Chairman R
OGERS and Ranking Member L
OWEY , to ensure that USAID has the resources it needs to continue and expand its presence and impact around the world.

VOTE EXPLANATION Mrs. M
CCASKILL. Mr. President, I was necessarily absent for today’s vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the nomination of Robert Lighthizer to be U.S. Trade Representative, with the rank of Ambassador. I would have voted yea. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I in-tend to object to any unanimous con-sent request at the present time relat-ing to the nomination of Courtney Elwood of Virginia to be the general counsel of the Central Intelligence Agency. I will object because the CIA has still not responded to my letters from April 14, 2014; and April 5, 2017, requesting de-classification of two congressional no-tifications, CNs, about whistleblower communications. In 2014, the inspector general of the Intelligence Community issued two CNs about whistleblower communications. The first, sent on March 28, 2014, had the unclassified subject line ‘‘Whistleblower Commu-nications.’’ The second, sent on March 31, 2014, had the unclassified subject line ‘‘Whistleblower Communications— Clarification.’’ Both documents were classified Secret/NOFORN. I requested that the CNs be declassified as soon as possible. More than 3 years have passed since my initial request, and I still have not received declassified versions of the documents or an explanation of why the documents have not been de-classified. The information contained in the two CNs raises serious policy implications, as well as potential Constitutional sep-aration-of-powers issues. The CNs do not appear to contain any information about sources or methods, and there is a strong public interest in their con-tent. As a matter of respect, for a co-equal branch of government, my de-classification request should have been processed in a timely manner. More-over, under the executive branch’s own regulations, there are time limits that apply to processing declassification re-quests and classification challenges that the CIA has failed to meet. In addition, I have requested copies of the CIA’s PPD–19 procedures and policies which allow CIA whistle-blowers to seek relief from reprisal, but the CIA has refused, stating that the documents are classified and for CIA’s internal use only. PPD–19 was largely codified by the Intelligence Authoriza-tion Act, and so the CIA is also re-quired by law to implement such a pol-icy. It is now at issue in a Federal law-suit challenging the CIA’s failure to adhere to its own procedures under the Administrative Procedures Act. My objection is not intended to ques-tion the credentials of Ms. Elwood in any way. However, the CIA must recog-nize that it has an ongoing obligation to respond to Congressional inquiries in a timely and reasonable manner. f 
NATIONAL NURSES WEEK Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the invaluable work of nurses.

single day. Their dedication and pas-sion to caregiving is constantly on dis-play, often during critical and stressful situations. The work they do helps save lives and gives reassurance to pa-tients facing questions about their health. While on the front lines of healthcare delivery they are also fre-quently the first line of communica-tion when health problems arise. These healthcare heroes wear many hats. Providing nurses with the resources they need to deliver quality care needs to be a priority. Last week, members of the Emergency Nurses Association from Arkansas shared with me one leg-islative fix to improve patient care. Amending the Controlled Substance Act to allow paramedics and other emergency medical services profes-sionals to continue to administer con-trolled substances like pain narcotics when allowed by State law would im-prove emergency outcomes, particu-larly in rural areas where a medical fa-cility may be miles away. That is why I cosponsored legislation to amend the Controlled Substance Act. Nurses are taking on more respon-sibilities in our evolving healthcare system in order to meet the needs of our aging population. They are being asked to do more with less and still provide the quality patient care they are known for. If you are like me and have been cared for by a nurse, you understand the important work they do. I am grateful for the care they provide and proudly support nurses as a cosponsor of the Senate resolution recognizing National Nurses Week.

70TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE LISTER-KNOWLTON VFW POST 9389 Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States traces its roots to 1899, when veterans returning home after the Spanish-American War joined together to support each other and to advance the ideals of our Nation. Nearly a half century later, on May 11, 1947, veterans returning to my hometown after World War II joined together for the same noble causes. Today I wish to com-memorate the 70th anniversary of List-er-Knowlton VFW Post 9389 in Caribou, ME. The name of Post 9389 signifies a fun-damental purpose of the VFW: to honor those who gave their lives for freedom. Private Evan Lister and CPL Edward Knowlton were both born in Caribou, both served in the U.S. Army during World War II, and both made the ulti-mate sacrifice when they were each just 23 years old. Neither will ever be forgotten. Nor will we ever forget those who returned home but who have since passed into history. It is sobering to note that today there is just one living charter member of the Caribou post, WWII veteran David O. Michaud, and we honor him for his service. In 2003, the Northern Maine Veterans Cemetery was dedicated in Caribou. This final resting place for our heroes was the result of many years of hard work and determined advocacy by com-mitted citizens, with our VFW post leading the way. My father, Donald Collins, a decorated World War II vet-eran, was among those who made that enduring tribute possible. A defining quality of America’s vet-erans is that they continue to serve long after their service in uniform ends. Members of the Caribou VFW and the auxiliary are part of a vast net-work that assists the patriots serving today, fellow veterans, and their fami-lies. They generously support a wide range of community projects, chari-table endeavors, and youth programs. One of the most important contribu-tions made by the VFW is its focus on educating our young people on Amer-ican values. Each year, more than 175,000 high school and middle school students nationwide join in the VFW’s Voice of Democracy and Patriot’s Pen essay competitions. That wonderful level of participation is always matched by the quality of the submis-sions. Last year, at the State VFW convention, I was delighted to con-gratulate the two Maine winners, in-cluding Corrine Corbin of Caribou, sponsored by our hometown VFW. I am proud to be a life member of the Caribou VFW Post auxiliary, which was also chartered in 1947. Working side by side, the VFW and auxiliary honor America and the men and women who defend us. It is a pleasure to con-gratulate the Lister-Knowlton VFW Post 9389 on this landmark anniver-sary. Mr. KING. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the Caribou VFW on their 70th anniversary. The Caribou VFW, known as the Lister-Knowlton VFW Post 9389, was founded on May 11, 1947, by veterans returning home from World War II. The post was named after two brave Caribou natives, Pri-vate Evan Lister and CPL Edward Knowlton, who served their country during World War II and made the ulti-mate sacrifice when they were only 23 years old. Their dedication and service to our country will never be forgotten. I also want to recognize the ladies auxiliary, who will celebrate their 70th anniversary on June 19. The ladies aux-iliary was formed by women who were mothers, wives, sisters, and daughters of veterans who served in our Armed Forces and whose service made them eligible for the Veterans of Foreign Wars. In addition, the auxiliary in-cludes female veterans who served abroad in times of war. While I want to take this oppor-tunity to acknowledge all of the vet-erans for their service, I want to make special note of David O. Michaud. David is a World War II veteran and the sole surviving charter member of the Lister-Knowlton VFW Post 9389. I would also like to honor Josephine Bell, an original charter member of the VFW Ladies Auxiliary in Caribou who is still with us today. These 70th anniversaries, of both the Lister-Knowlton VFW post and the la-dies auxiliary, provide occasion to cele-brate the storied tradition of service, both past and present, that the Vet-erans of Foreign Wars represent. Each of us is forever indebted to those mem-bers of the VFW who served in the pro-tection of the United States and to their families for the care and support they have provided. We are also grate-ful to the VFW for their continued service, supporting those veterans who have returned, advocating on their be-half at all levels of government, and or-ganizing a variety of community build-ing projects. In closing, I am glad to join with the members of the VFW and the ladies auxiliary in Caribou in honoring this 70th year of working on behalf of vet-erans, the State of Maine, and our great Nation. f

RECOGNIZING THE RUTGERS UNI-VERSITY–NEWARK DEBATE TEAM ∑Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the Rutgers Univer-sity–Newark senior debate team of Ni-cole Nave and Devane Murphy as they celebrate back-to-back national cham-pionships with their victories at the National Debate Tournament, NDT, and the Cross Examination Debate As-sociation National Tournament this year. Last year, I stood on this floor to recognize Rutgers University–Newark’s victory at the National Debate Tour-nament at the University of Missouri– Kansas City. This year, I am extremely proud to be here once again congratu-lating Rutgers–Newark on another col-legiate National Debate Tournament championship. This is truly an impres-sive and historic accomplishment. It is only the second time in collegiate de-bate history that the same team has won both national championships in a single year. In addition to the national cham-pionship, Nicole Nave and Devane Mur-phy were also honored individually at the National Debate Tournament this year. Devane was named the NDT’s top speaker, and Nicole received the NDT second place speaker award. At this year’s Cross Examination Debate Asso-ciation National tournament, Nicole earned a record-shattering five perfect scores out of eight. Nicole and Devane, the two best collegiate debaters in America, use their life experiences to shape their uniquely Rutgers–Newark debate style, one which has led the Rutgers University–Newark team to re-main ranked as the No. 1 team in the Nation.

TRIBUTE TO JACK YOUNG ∑Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, this week, I have the distinct honor of rec-ognizing Jack Young, a U.S. Army vet-eran and teacher at Harlem Public Schools. Whether serving our Nation inside an Abrams tank or serving his local community at the front of a classroom, Jack has represented the character of the Treasure State in both settings. After graduating from high school, Jack enlisted in the Army. He served our Nation on Active Duty for 4 years and completed two overseas assign-ments. Not long after finishing his military service, Jack attended Mon-tana State University—Northern and trained to become a teacher. In 2006, he began teaching at Harlem Public Schools. Since arriving in Blaine Coun-ty, he has grown into a fixture in the local community. Jack has taught his-tory and government to both high school and junior high school students. During the warm months, you will find Jack in the classroom teaching sum-mer school, helping students rise to the next level academically. For the past 4 years, he has taught government courses at the Aaniiih Nakoda College. Earlier in his teaching career, Jack was an assistant coach for the Harlem Wildcats football team. Through all seasons and across multiple academic levels, Jack has served his fellow Mon-tanans by teaching the historic context and hard-earned value of our constitu-tional system of government. Jack has excelled in his transition from a tanker to a teacher. The best part of Jack’s story is he loves what he does and plans to continue doing it for a long time. Montanans are grateful for folks like Jack who make our commu-nities stronger. Thank you, Jack, for your service, and I wish you the best in the years to come.∑

As a law clerk on the Commerce Committee, Mike as-sisted the Consumer Protection, Prod-uct Safety, Insurance, and Data Secu-rity Subcommittee. He is a dedicated worker who has been committed to get-ting the most out of his clerkship. I ex-tend my sincere thanks and apprecia-tion to Mike for all of the fine work he did for the committee and wish him continued success in the years to come.∑ f 
50TH ANNIVERSARY OF HELLS CANYON PRESERVATION COUNCIL ∑Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the 50th anniversary of the Hells Canyon Preservation Coun-cil. Without the council and its coura-geous work, there might be multiple dams despoiling one of the deepest gorges in North America rather than the wondrous Snake Wild and Scenic River flowing through the Hells Can-yon National Recreation Area and Hells Canyon Wilderness. The story of the creation of the coun-cil begins in 1967 as a conflict sim-mered for a long time over damming Hells Canyon, an 85-mile gorge on the Oregon-Idaho border. That fight ap-peared to solely turn on the question of who would get to build the dam in Hells Canyon, not whether to build the dam on what is often called the Grand Canyon of the Snake River. Wash-ington Public Power Supply System, WPPSS, delivered public power and Idaho Power Company was a private power supplier. In 1964, the Federal Power Commission ruled in favor of the private power, WPPSS appealed, and their dispute went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. On June 5, 1967, Justice William O. Douglas read the Court’s majority opinion from the bench. The Supreme Court ruled neither for public power nor for private power. Instead, it re-manded the entire case back to the Federal Power Commission with in-structions to consider whether the best dam in Hells Canyon might be no dam at all. The Supreme Court ruled that the case wasn’t about public versus pri-vate power. Instead, Justice Douglas said: ‘‘Nor is the test solely whether the region will be able to use the addi-tional power. The test is whether the project will be in the public interest. And that determination can be made only after an exploration of all issues relevant to the ‘public interest,’ in-cluding future power demand and sup-ply, alternate sources of power, the public interest in preserving reaches of wild rivers and wilderness areas, the preservation of anadromous fish for commercial and recreational purposes, and the protection of wildlife.’’ Within 2 months, the debate over the best use of Hells Canyon shifted from what entity would dam it, to the core question of whether to dam it. Six members of the Idaho Alpine Club met in a Boise living room and formed the Hells Canyon Preservation Council. Joining that group was a young Seattle lawyer and Sierra Club attorney named Brock Evans. Brock soon fell in love with Hells Canyon and northeastern Oregon and vowed that the Snake River would not be dammed. The Hells Canyon Preser-vation Council soon grew to have more than 2,000 members in all 50 States. Its chapters included one in the little town of Enterprise in Wallowa County, home to half of Hells Canyon. The national attention attracted media personality Arthur Godfrey and folk singer Pete Seeger, along with national environ-mental groups who wanted to save the great gorge. Their efforts also attracted the at-tention of Oregon Senator Bob Pack-wood. From his first day in office, Sen-ator Packwood championed the preser-vation of Hells Canyon. It took 8 years of hard work by Brock, assisted by Doug Scott, a native Oregonian who replaced Brock as the Sierra Club’s Northwest Representa-tive—and so many others inside and outside of Congress; yet that sweat eq-uity paid off in 1975 when Congress passed the Hells Canyon National Recreation Area Act. I am proud to say that Brock and his wife, Linda, have recently returned to Oregon, having moved to La Grande, near his beloved Hells Canyon. Oregonians and all Americans are in-debted to the Hells Canyon Preserva-tion Council and its allies, including Senator Packwood and many other fine Oregonians, for their tireless advocacy for preserving wild nature for the ben-efit of all of us today as well as future generations. Thanks to their work, we Oregonians today consider the Hells Canyon Na-tional Recreation Area, the Hells Can-yon Wilderness, and the Snake Wild and Scenic River to be an irreplaceable part of our priceless natural legacy, and we would no more think of dam-ming Hells Canyon than of draining Crater Lake.∑

School, representing the Hoosier State. To be in the running for the national invitational, student contestants must display their knowledge, as well as cur-rent political awareness and constitu-tional acumen by holding mock or sim-ulated congressional hearings at the local and State level during the cur-rent school year. Once qualified, during the final competition in DC, similar to the simulated congressional hearings held at the local level to be one of the eight finalists, each class went before a group of judges. Teams were allocated a 4-minute introductory statement and then faced pressing questions per-taining to existing constitutional sub-jects as well as past from the judges. The winning team must show an excep-tional understanding of constitutional principles applicable to historical and current issues. For the record, I want to acknowl-edge each student of the Fishers Junior High School team who participated in achieving first place in the We the Peo-ple National Invitational: Makenna Adams, Izzy Alexander, Addi Arena, Blake Backes, Jackson Bakle, Mac-kenzie Boyer, Milan Colzani, Joe Conde, Kamryn Dean, Grace DeLong, Sydney Doyle, Madison Ewart, Faith Farrell, Maya Fotedar, Abby Funk, Ray Gao, Abigail Garrison, Meg Gib-son, Liberty Hayes, Morgan Joiner, Braden Kirkendall, Shea Koley, Ben Lilley, Tatiyana Lockridge, Olivia Lux, Ali Mohamed, Cassidy Robertson, Gracey Scholl, Kara Van Dyke, Jonah VanDer Kamp, and Bailey Wilson. Fur-thermore, I would like to recognize Mr. Mike Fassold for his efforts to teach and implement a passion for constitu-tional and civic engagement in his stu-dents. Again, congratulations to the Fishers Junior High School team for their ex-traordinary victory, and thank you for representing your fellow Hoosiers. It is truly an honor to have brilliant stu-dents in the State of Indiana who in-spire others with their knowledge, hard work, and dedication.∑

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS By Mr. DAINES: S. 1097. A bill to postpone the dead-line for the completion of the conver-sion of certain military technician (dual status) positions to positions of civilian employment by the Federal Government, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Armed Services. Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the R
ECORD . There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the R
ECORD , as follows: 
S. 1097 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-resentatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Armed Forces Reserve and National Guard Dual- Status Review and Modernization Act’’. 
SEC. 2. POSTPONEMENT OF DEADLINE FOR COM-PLETION OF CONVERSION OF CER-TAIN MILITARY TECHNICIAN (DUAL STATUS) POSITIONS TO POSITIONS OF CIVILIAN EMPLOYMENT BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. 
(a) F INDINGS .—Congress makes the fol-lowing findings: (1) A September 2013 study conducted by a federally funded research and development center found that 21 percent of the military technician (dual status) positions are admin-istrative in nature—the largest category as a percentage of military technician (dual sta-tus) positions. The study recommends inves-tigation on whether ‘‘some Dual Status MilTech positions supporting general admin-istration functions could be converted to Title 5 Federal civilian full-time support po-sitions without compromising unit readi-ness’’. The study further recommends inves-tigation on whether ‘‘it is more appropriate to use military full-time support for other reasons (such as currency in military oper-ations and training and augmentation)’’. (2) Section 1053 of the National Defense Au-thorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 directs the conversion of not fewer than 20 percent of all military technician positions to posi-tions of Federal civilian employment under title 5, United States Code, by January 1, 2017. Section 1084 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 ex-tends the deadline for that conversion from January 1, 2017, to October 1, 2017. (3) The Department of Defense submitted a report on the management of military tech-nicians in December 2016 that finds that 12.6 percent of the military technician (dual sta-tus) positions were administrative in nature, and recommended a conversion of 4.8 percent of such positions to positions of Federal ci-vilian employment. (4) The Chief of the National Guard Bureau testified before Congress in April 2017 that a conversion of 20 percent of military techni-cian (dual status) positions to positions of Federal civilian employment would degrade readiness, but that a lower number could be converted with minimal impact. The Chief of the National Guard Bureau also testified that the Department of Defense had not con-ducted an analysis of the associated costs and benefits of a conversion of 20 percent of military technician (dual status) positions to positions of Federal civilian employment. (b) POSTPONEMENT OF DEADLINE FOR COM-
PLETION OF CONVERSION .—Notwithstanding the deadline otherwise specified in paragraph (1) of section 1053(a) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 (10 U.S.C. 113 note) for the completion of the conversion of military technician positions as described in that subsection, the deadline for the completion of such conversion shall be 180 days after the date on which the Sec-retary of Defense transmits to Congress under paragraph (6) of subsection (c) the re-port of the working group required by para-graph (5) of that subsection. (c) W
ORKING GROUP ON FULLTIMESUPPORT  
OF THE RESERVE COMPONENTS .— (1) I
N GENERAL .—There shall be established in the Department of Defense a working group to be known as the ‘‘Working Group on Full Time Support of the Reserve Compo-nents’’ (in this subsection referred to as the ‘‘working group’’). (2) C

support of the reserve components of the Armed Forces, including the following: (A) An identification of the missions, pur-poses, and objectives of military technicians (dual status) in support of an operational re-serve force. (B) A review of the posture of current mili-tary technician (dual status) positions, and of their current role in meeting the objec-tives identified pursuant to subparagraph (A). (C) An analysis of potential restructurings of the workforce of military technicians (dual status) in order to identify a restruc-turing that fully aligns military technician (dual status) positions with objectives for full time support of the reserve components. (D) An identification of the military tech-nician (dual status) positions whose conver-sion to positions of Federal civilian employ-ment under title 5, United States Code, would best ensure the achievement of objec-tives for full time support of the reserve components. (E) An assessment of the impact on the readiness of the National Guard for domestic operations of the conversion of positions identified pursuant to subparagraph (D) as described in that subparagraph. (F) An assessment of costs and potential savings associated with the conversion of po-sitions identified pursuant to subparagraph (D) as described in that subparagraph. (5) R
EPORT TO SECRETARY OF DEFENSE .—Not later than 180 days after the date of the en-actment of this Act, the working group shall submit to the Secretary of Defense a report on the comprehensive review undertaken pursuant to paragraph (4). The report shall include the following: (A) A comprehensive description of the re-view and the results of the review. (B) The percentage of military technician (dual status) positions whose conversion to positions of Federal civilian employment under title 5, United States Code, would best ensure the achievement of objectives for full time support of the reserve components of the Armed Forces as an operational reserve. (C) A transition plan for implementing a new force structure for full time support of the reserve components, including for the conversion of positions as described in sub-paragraph (B) which mitigates any risks to readiness identified pursuant to paragraph (4)(E). (D) Recommendations for the reform of personnel management policy for military technician (dual status) positions that ad-dress— (i) the eligibility of military technicians (dual status) for civilian retirement upon re-tirement from the Armed Forces; and (ii) the process for appealing employment decisions. (E) Recommendations for reforms of com-pensation and benefits policies for military technician (dual status) positions in order to provide military technicians (dual status) with parity in compensation and benefits with other Federal civilian employees of the Department of Defense under title 5, United States Code. (6) T
RANSMITTAL OF REPORT TO CONGRESS .— The Secretary shall transmit to the congres-sional defense committees the report of the working group under paragraph (5), together with such discussion and recommendations in connection with the report as the Sec-retary considers appropriate. The Secretary shall publish the report, and any such discus-sions and recommendations, in the Federal Register at the time of transmittal. (7) C
ONGRESSIONAL DEFENSE COMMITTEES  
DEFINED .—In this subsection, the term ‘‘con-gressional defense committees’’ has the meaning given that term in section 101(a)(16) of title 10, United States Code. Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, under current law, twenty-percent of our military dual-status technicians in the National Guard, Army Reserve, and Air Force Reserve will become federal ci-vilians on October 1st. This will leave the state Governors to respond to wildfires, floods, and other natural dis-asters with twenty-percent fewer peo-ple. The benefits of this conversion are unclear. In fact, the Chief of the Na-tional Guard Bureau testified that no formal analysis has been conducted as to whether there is any benefit at all. It seems prudent to me to take a pause, bring all of the affected stakeholders together, and figure this problem out before we take any irreversible action. Today, I’m introducing the ‘‘Armed Forces Reserve and National Guard Dual-Status Review and Modernization Act,’’ to do exactly that. As I’ve studied this situation, I un-derstand there are a number of valid concerns involved. The current statu-tory construct for dual-status military technicians is nearly 50 years old and the role of the Reserve components has changed dramatically just in the past 15 years, let alone the last half-cen-tury. I agree we should update the stat-ute to better meet the needs of the total force and my bill addresses this concern. Similarly, many Guardsmen and Reservists feel that personnel man-agement practices under this aging construct doesn’t fit the needs of a 21st century workforce. My bill addresses those concerns as well. Most importantly, the bill ensures that there is no adverse impact to the Guard’s ability to respond to domestic emergencies on October 1st, by post-poning that date until Department of Defense leadership conducts a thor-ough, comprehensive review on the re-quirements of a 21st Century total force, and how our current structure should be aligned to meet those re-quirements. This will allow Congress to make an informed and measured judge-ment on how to update current law. I urge my colleagues to give this matter their full consideration and support. 
By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Ms. C
OLLINS ): S. 1113. A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to en-sure the safety of cosmetics; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to im-prove the safety oversight of products that affect every single family on a daily basis. Whether it’s shampoo or shaving cream, lotion or make-up, hair dye or deodorant, personal care prod-ucts are a part of our everyday lives. I thank Senator C
OLLINS for her support and hard work on this important legis-lation. However, even though our bodies ab-sorb many chemicals in these products through our skin and even our nails, their ingredients are largely unregu-lated. It’s time to modernize our safety oversight and correct this problem. Most people assume these products have up-to-date federal oversight, but in reality the Food and Drug Adminis-tration’s authority to do so is sorely outdated—in fact, it’s based on a law from the 1930s that has changed little over the past eight decades. There are questions about the safety of some in-gredients in these products, which not only leads to health concerns but also causes uncertainty for companies working to innovate and expand do-mestically. Over the last several years, Senator COLLINS and I have worked with a wide group of stakeholders that represent both industry and consumer groups. Those stakeholders include small and large companies, doctors, consumer ad-vocates, patient advocates, scientists, and the Food and Drug Administration. Together, we have drafted bipartisan legislation that puts commonsense measures in place and has the support of both industry and consumer and health organizations. The Personal Care Products Safety Act sets up a process for reviewing the safety of ingredients in personal care products. The bill requires manufactur-ers to register so consumers know who produces personal care products sold in the United States. The legislation also modernizes au-thority for the Food and Drug Admin-istration so the agency is better equipped to deal with public health concerns, such as being able to recall contaminated products if companies choose not to do so voluntarily. The updated system is completely paid for by industry fees. Companies will pro-vide information about the ingredients in their products to the Food and Drug Administration, and attest to their safety. Many companies manufacturing in the United States currently follow strict voluntary standards for manu-facturing under proper conditions, but the lack of federal standards leaves this to chance. Under this legislation, the agency sets Good Manufacturing Practice guidelines to ensure compa-nies meet minimum requirements. Companies will also need to report ad-verse health events related to their products to the Food and Drug Admin-istration. Last year, we heard about WEN shampoo, a product that was causing significant hair loss. Among those af-fected were children, including a little girl named Eliana who lost all of her hair after using WEN. She shared her story with my office and several of my colleagues. What’s shocking is that the company received more than 20,000 re-ports of this happening, but under cur-rent law WEN had no legal obligation to tell the Food and Drug Administra-tion. Under this legislation, companies would be required to do so. Another example of concern is the ongoing use of formaldehyde, also called methylene glycol when mixed with water, in the popular hair treat-ment called a Brazilian blowout. Form-aldehyde is released into the air during

this beauty treatment. It can cause shortness of breath, headaches, and diz-ziness in the short-term. Over the long- term, formaldehyde has been linked to cancer. I am also greatly concerned about the effect on the health of salon profes-sionals who are constantly exposed to a variety of chemicals daily. In addition to reviewing the safety of chemicals they may be exposed to, this legisla-tion also ensures that the salon prod-ucts they use are properly labeled with ingredients and warnings. The Food and Drug Administration will be required to evaluate at least five ingredients per year for safety and use in personal care products. In addi-tion to reviewing the latest scientific and medical studies, the agency will consider how prevalent the ingredient is, the likely exposure, adverse event reports, and information from public comments. Public input will be critical to the review process. There will be op-portunities for companies, scientists, consumer groups, medical profes-sionals, and members of the public to weigh in on, not only the safety of par-ticular ingredients but also, which in-gredients should be a priority for re-view. After review, the Food and Drug Administration may deem an ingre-dient safe, unsafe, or safe under certain uses or under certain conditions. The agency will also have the authority to require warning labels as needed for certain ingredients and limit the amount of an ingredient that may be used in personal care products. For ex-ample, some ingredients may only be safe for use by adults or when used by professionals in a salon or spa setting. The Personal Care Products Safety Act is the result of many diverse groups working together with the com-mon goal of modernizing the federal oversight system to ensure the safest products possible are on the market. We have worked closely with small businesses to ensure that the legisla-tion recognizes their needs and sup-ports their growth. This legislation in-corporates changes to increase flexi-bility for small businesses, particularly those making low-risk products. The bill recognizes the unique nature of the handmade cosmetic industry and meets their needs to encourage growth and innovation. I am pleased that the major organiza-tions representing these small busi-nesses (Handmade Cosmetic Alliance, Coalition of Handcrafted Entre-preneurs, Handcrafted Soap and Cos-metic Guild), have said that the provi-sions within this legislation ‘‘afford producers in the handmade cosmetic industry the opportunity to continue to innovate, grow, create jobs and produce safe, quality handmade prod-ucts in communities across the na-tion.’’ I am pleased to have the support of a broad coalition, including Environ-mental Working Group, Society for Women’s Health Research, Endocrine Society, National Alliance for Hispanic Health, Au Naturale, Coalition of Handcrafted Entrepreneurs, Handcrafted Soap and Cosmetic Guild, Handmade Cosmetic Alliance, Herban Lifestyle, The Honest Company, Amer-ican Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, Babo Botanicals, Goddess Garden Organics, Caregiver Action Network, March of Dimes, EO Prod-ucts, E´clair Naturals, Juice Beauty, National Psoriasis Foundation, and the following major companies that to-gether represent over 99 brands of prod-ucts: The Estee Lauder Companies, Johnson and Johnson, Procter and Gamble, Revlon, Unilever, and L’Oreal. I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this much needed legisla-tion to modernize our outdated regu-latory system for personal care prod-ucts, and I hope the Senate will pass this long overdue legislation this year.

A bill to nullify the effect of the recent Executive order laying a foundation for discrimination against LGBTQ individuals, women, religious minorities, and others under the pre-text of religious freedom; to the Com-mittee on the Judiciary. Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President. I rise today to join with my colleagues in introducing a rescission bill to nul-lify President Trump’s Executive Order 13798, titled ‘‘Promoting Free Speech and Religious Liberty.’’ Unfortunately, this Executive Order does not live up to its title. Instead, it furthers the aim of this administration to diminish crit-ical protections for women, minorities, and LGBT Americans. I am deeply troubled by Section 3 of the Order, which paves the way for the Trump administration to roll back pro-tections to preventive health services under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), especially for women and LGBT indi-viduals. Through new regulations issued pursuant to this Order, compa-nies could use ‘‘conscience-based’’ ob-jections to deny their employees cov-erage for preventive services that they have a right to under the ACA. This means that because of their employers’ moral objection, women could lose ac-cess to contraception, and those in the LGBT community could lose access to essential services, including cancer screenings or counseling for domestic violence. I respect that we all have religious and moral convictions, but it is wrong to put employers’ religious views above individuals’ rights to access basic health care. I also note that this sec-tion of the Order invites members of the President’s Cabinet to eliminate an accommodation President Obama ad-ministration made allowing religiously affiliated nonprofit employers, includ-ing large universities and hospital sys-tems, to opt out of providing their em-ployees with contraception coverage based on religious objections. Importantly, women working for ob-jecting employers can receive contra-ception coverage directly through their insurance companies. Seven federal courts of appeals have upheld this ac-commodation in the face of religiously based challenges. But with this Order, the President signals that his adminis-tration is likely to do away with the accommodation, which would deny contraception access to women whose bosses want to make this important and intimate decision for them. The Order also directs the Attorney General to issue guidance to all agen-cies on ‘‘religious liberty protections in Federal law.’’ This language is con-cerning as it opens the door for the At-torney General to eliminate protec-tions in federal rules and regulations for LGBT individuals and minorities. The Attorney General’s duty is to en-force and protect the civil rights and constitutional freedoms of all Ameri-cans. This Order’s direction for guid-ance that could change the implemen-tation of critical rules affording equal treatment for all in America is a dis-turbing step backward. For example, there are rules protecting same-sex spouses’ ability to visit their partners in the hospital and ensuring that LGBT individuals have equal access to feder-ally funded emergency housing. Under this provision, however, new religious exemptions may be implemented to weaken these protections. Shelters could turn LGBT families away be-cause of who they love. As the Human Rights Campaign has described, this provision opens the door to a ‘‘license to discriminate’’ even where basic serv-ices funded with government dollars are at stake. This Executive Order opens the door to weakening the enforcement of long-standing tax laws against individuals, houses of worship, and other religious organizations engaging in political campaign speech. Notably, the Johnson Amendment was proposed by Lyndon B. Johnson in 1954 and is part of our tax code. It prohibits 501(c)(3) tax-ex-empt entities, including churches, from engaging in political campaign activity on behalf of candidates. The Johnson Amendment does not bar nonpartisan voter education and registration ac-tivities, which are important to a strong democracy, nor does it prohibit speech on moral issues. The President has promised to repeal the Johnson Amendment. Doing so could have a significant impact on po-litical campaign fundraising and would change the current tax consideration for certain political contributions. While repeal of the Johnson Amend-ment is something only Congress has the power to do, this Executive Order clearly indicates the administration’s intention to undermine the separation

between tax-exempt charities and reli-gious organizations and political cam-paign activity in the tax code. It remains to be seen whether the President and the administration will implement this Order in ways that will realize our worst fears about the kind of discrimination it could enable. But we know for certain that this Order represents a disturbing statement of principles and values. Instead of seek-ing even greater protections from dis-crimination, this administration has set the stage to undermine protections, especially for women and LGBT indi-viduals. That is not what our country stands for. Mr. President, I strongly urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the bill I am introducing today to nullify this troubling Executive Order. Thank you. I yield the floor.

SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS 
SENATE RESOLUTION 162—RE-AFFIRMING THE COMMITMENT OF THE UNITED STATES TO PRO-MOTING RELIGIOUS FREEDOM, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES Mr. LANKFORD (for himself, Mr. C
OONS , and Mr. R UBIO) submitted the following resolution; which was re-ferred to the Committee on Foreign Relations: 
S. R ES. 162 Whereas the United States Congress has a proud history of promoting internationally recognized human rights; Whereas religious freedom is a funda-mental human right of all people; Whereas the free exercise of religion must stand for the right to practice any faith or to choose no faith at all; Whereas every individual’s rights to free-dom of thought, conscience, and religion is guaranteed under the United Nations Uni-versal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted at Paris December 10, 1948, and the Inter-national Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, adopted at New York December 16, 1966, which recognize, ‘‘Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief, and freedom, ei-ther alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance.’’; Whereas, during his 1941 State of the Union address, President Franklin D. Roosevelt noted the ‘‘Four Freedoms’’ that the world should be founded upon, including the ‘‘free-dom of every person to worship God in his own way—everywhere in the world’’; Whereas, according to the United States Commission on International Religious Free-dom (USCIRF), abuses committed by govern-ments and non-state actors has increased and the incarceration of prisoners of con-science remains widespread; Whereas, according to the latest Pew Re-search Center’s Study of Global Restrictions on Religion, which surveyed 2015, an esti-mated 79 percent of the world’s population lives in countries where freedom of religion and conscience is highly restricted, either by the government or social groups; Whereas the 2017 report produced by USCIRF recommended that the Department of State designate the following countries as Countries of Particular Concern: Burma, Central African Republic, China, Eritrea, Iran, Nigeria, North Korea, Pakistan, Rus-sia, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam; Whereas, in the same report, USCIRF cat-egorized as Tier 2 violators, meaning viola-tions engaged in or tolerated by the govern-ment are serious and characterized by at least one of the elements of the ‘systematic, ongoing, and egregious’ Country of Par-ticular Concern standard, Afghanistan, Azer-baijan, Bahrain, Cuba, Egypt, India, Indo-nesia, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Laos, Malaysia, and Turkey; Whereas USCIRF also recommended that the Department of State designate the fol-lowing non-state actors as entities of par-ticular concern: the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), the Taliban in Afghanistan, and al-Shabaab in Somalia; Whereas, according to the Pew Research Center Study, the two geographic regions with the highest government restrictions continue to be the Middle East-North Africa and the Asia-Pacific; Whereas Congress has recognized that Christians, Yezidis, Shi’a, Turkmen, Shabak, Sabean-Mandeans, Kaka’i, and other reli-gious and ethnic minorities in Iraq and Syria have faced genocide and other crimes against humanity perpetrated by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), and that ISIL seeks to eradicate the communities of these minorities; Whereas Egyptian Coptic Christians have been repeatedly targeted and their aggres-sors have gone unprosecuted, including two suicide bombings conducted by ISIL that killed 44 people at Coptic churches on Palm Sunday 2017 and an attack in December 2016 that killed 29 and injured numerous other Coptic worshipers, many of whom were women and children; Whereas, according to USCIRF, Rohingya Muslims and other religious and ethnic mi-norities, including Christians, in Burma have faced ongoing persecution from state and non-state actors for decades, including inci-dents of intimidation and violence; the forced relocation and destruction of religious sites; violent attacks by mobs and the mili-tary; sexual violence and trafficking in per-sons, and an ongoing campaign of coerced conversion to Buddhism; Whereas, according to USCIRF’s most re-cent annual report, conditions for freedom of religion or belief in China continue to de-cline, with authorities targeting anyone con-sidered a threat to the state, including reli-gious believers, and Chinese authorities ar-rested Christians for displaying the cross in their homes and printing religious materials, threatened parents for bringing their chil-dren to church, and blocked them from hold-ing certain religious activities; Whereas, according to USCIRF, the Gov-ernment of Eritrea continues to target Evan-gelical and Pentecostal Christians and Jeho-vah’s Witnesses, suppresses the religious ac-tivities of Muslims, dominates the internal affairs of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Eri-trea, and has engaged in the torture of reli-gious prisoners; Whereas apostasy and blasphemy laws are routinely used across the Middle East and North Africa to intimidate and punish mi-nority faiths and those who would leave Islam; Whereas, according to Human Rights Watch, in Pakistan, Christians, Hindus, and Ahmadis are often the victims of violent ex-tremists; forced conversion and marriage of Christian and Hindu girls and young women remains a systemic problem; and blasphemy laws are often used as an excuse to settle personal scores or stir up religious animosity against marginalized religious minorities, resulting in a climate of fear and a chilling effect on religious expression; Whereas, according to the Department of State’s 2015 International Religious Freedom Report, the Government of Iran continues to repress religious minorities, including Ba-ha’is, Christians, Sunnis, Sufis, Yarsanis, and Zoroastrians, by raiding religious gath-erings services, arresting and imprisoning worshipers and religious leaders, imprisoning educators, confiscating properties, and exe-cuting dissidents; Whereas, according to the Department of State’s 2015 International Religious Freedom Report, the Government of Sudan has sys-tematically targeted the Christian commu-nity, prosecuting Christian pastors on trumped-up charges, confiscating Christian- owned properties, banning the construction of new Christian houses of worship, destroy-ing numerous religious facilities throughout the country, and targeting human rights de-fenders for legally representing the Christian community; Whereas, according to the February 2014 report of the United Nations Commission of Inquiry on the Human Rights Situation of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), there is ‘‘an almost complete denial of the right to freedom of thought, con-science, and religion,’’and the Government of the DPRK ‘‘considers the spread of Christi-anity a particularly serious threat’’ and en-forces severe punishments for the practice of Christianity; Whereas the global religious freedom crisis we are experiencing today has created mil-lions of victims and undermines liberty, prosperity, and peace in places vital to United States national interests—posing di-rect challenges to United States interests in the Middle East, Russia, China, and sub-Sa-haran Africa; Whereas the absence of fundamental human rights, including religious freedom, contributes to persecution of minorities, re-ligious extremism, terrorism, and insta-bility; Whereas there is greater peace, political and social stability, economic development, democratization, and women’s empowerment when human rights, including religious free-dom, are protected and advanced; and Whereas Congress recently recognized, with broad bipartisan support, in the Frank R. Wolf International Religious Freedom Act (Public Law 114–281), enacted on December 16, 2016, that because the promotion of inter-national religious freedom protects human rights, advances democracy abroad, and ad-vances United States interests in stability, security, and development globally, the pro-motion of international religious freedom re-quires new and evolving policies, and diplo-matic responses that are drawn from the ex-pertise of the national security agencies, the diplomatic services, and other governmental agencies and nongovernmental organiza-tions, and are coordinated across and carried out by the entire range of Federal agencies: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Senate— (1) reaffirms the commitment of the United States to promoting religious free-dom as a fundamental human right and calls on the President and the Secretary of State, in accordance with the International Reli-gious Freedom Act of 1998 (Public Law 105– 292), as amended by the Frank R. Wolf Inter-national Religious Freedom Act (Public Law 114–281), to strengthen United States foreign policy on behalf of individuals persecuted in foreign countries on account of religion; (2) calls on the President, the Secretary of State, and the Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom to develop an action plan on international religious

AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT OF 2017 
SPEECH OF  
HON. BARBARA LEE 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 4, 2017 Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise once again in strong opposition to H.R. 1628, which is a bill to take away health care from 24 million Americans. Whether you believe it or not, health care is a basic right. This shameful bill steals from the most vul-nerable among us, including seniors, veterans, people living with HIV, children, and the dis-abled. And this new bill is even more dan-gerous and destructive than when they brought it to the Floor last time. It would, yes, rip away health care from 24 million people. It would reduce benefits, make families pay more for less, and transfer $600 billion in tax cuts to the very wealthy. This is outrageous. Access to women’s health is denied by defunding Planned Parent-hood. Medicaid, as we know it, will end. Healthcare costs for working families and sen-iors will skyrocket. It allows states to eliminate essential health benefits like maternity care, cancer screenings, and emergency care. Mr. Speaker, this is not a health bill at all. This is a massive tax giveaway to the wealthy. Let me tell you, as a woman of faith, I am appalled and I am saddened by the hypocrisy displayed in this bill by people who say they are religious. I want to remind you—in the Scriptures, the Book of Mark, chapter 12:31, we are reminded to love your neighbor as yourself. I hope Republicans remember to love their neighbor as themselves today and vote ‘‘no’’ on this mean-spirited and evil bill. Let’s defeat this harmful and morally bankrupt bill. This is a matter of life and death, and the American people deserve better.

AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT OF 2017 
SPEECH OF  
HON. JOHN J. FASO 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 4, 2017 Mr. FASO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my support for the American Health Care Act. As I have said from the beginning, when it comes to the Affordable Care Act, we should keep what works and change what doesn’t. I urge support for the AHCA because it does just that. The AHCA stops the Washington, DC, one- size-fits-all approach to healthcare and puts choice and freedom back in the hands of states, counties, families, and individuals. With the AHCA’s monumental strides in reforming Medicaid to ensure its solvency for our most vulnerable citizens and repealing burdensome taxes on the middle class, it is a win across the board for all Americans, but specifically Upstate New Yorkers. Upstate New York residents will see addi-tional benefits due to an amendment which Congressman COLLINS and I have included in the bill. This language is one of the greatest pieces of state mandate relief that New York-ers have ever seen. By normalizing the fash-ion in which New York State funds Medicaid, those in my district alone will see more than $224 million in tax relief every year. The fact is that New York funds its Medicaid program by imposing a portion of the state’s funding responsibility on the counties. Home ownership is burdened by lower property val-ues due to high taxes. This also lessens busi-ness competitiveness in areas like Upstate NY. The extent to which New York burdens its counties is unlike any other: of the approxi-mately $9.5 billion in Medicaid costs shoul-dered by localities nationwide, New York local-ities account for more than $7 billion of the total. Albany mandates ensure that New York spends more on Medicaid than Texas and Florida combined. This is simply unsustainable. The people of Upstate New York demand relief: relief from burdensome Albany man-dates; relief from rising property taxes; relief from Washington-controlled, bureaucratic healthcare; relief from ACA-imposed, middle- class healthcare taxes. For these reasons, I support the AHCA and urge my colleagues to support this bill.

HONORING THE PERMIAN BASIN HONOR FLIGHT—MAY 2017 
HON. K. MICHAEL CONAWAY

Mr. Speaker, I rise to rec-ognize the 88 veterans from West Texas who will be visiting Washington, D.C. this week, sponsored by the Permian Basin Honor Flight.

The veterans on this Honor Flight are Clint Adams, Larry Allen, Robert Barbee, William Bourbon, Johnny Bragg, Patrido Brijalba, James Brooks, Randall Brooks, Jack Brookshire, Norval Brown, Leo Carr, Garry Clark, Edmundo Cobos, Edward Comacho, Jose Contreras, Guadalupe Cruz, Marvin Crain, Michael Crain, Ernest Davis, MJ Dinkins, Richard Dolan, Jose Duarte, Michael Dyess, Rayburn Favre, Carlton Fite, Richard Foncannon, John Foreman, Richard Galloway, Bobby Gann, Jerry Giles, Gonzalo Guzman, Barry Handlin, Donald Hawke, John Hayes, Harry Hemmenway, Cary Holt, John Hood, Earl Jackson, Joe Jackson, Marvin Jennings, Albert Johnson, Thomas Johnston, Velton Jones, William Jones, James Langston, Rob-ert Lathrop, Robert Love, Lee Maston, Mark Martin, Robert Martin, Walter Mason, Donald McSparran, Miguel Medina, Donald Merritt, Dory Miles, Kenneth Moore, Donnie Murray, Michael Norman, John Palmer, Jerry Par-tridge, Charles Pounds, Robert Patterson, Robert Price, Daniel Ramirez, Donald Ritchey, Joe Robledo, Jesus Rodriguez, Gary Roe, Monica Schwab, Dennis Sever, Larry Sisk, William Smartt, Larry Stowe, Oscar Taylor, Gustavo Tijerina, Bernaro Tucker, Joe Turner, Lewis VanZant, Sandra VanZant, Joe Villalva, Mark Webb, Donnie White, Eddy Willmon, Leo Wilson, Willie Woods. Mr. Speaker, I am humbled to have the op-portunity to meet these brave men and women who exemplify the best of our country. Their sacrifice and commitment to the duty to our nation can never be fully repaid, and I hope that when they visit our nation’s monuments in Washington, D.C., the gratitude and respect we have for them will truly be reflected. Colleagues, please join me in thanking these veterans and their families for their ex-emplary dedication and service to this great nation. I would also like to extend a special thank you to the local communities, all of the volunteers, and Ms. Teresa Galloway and Mr. John West for their extensive work in orga-nizing this Honor Flight. This trip would not have been possible without all the financial and emotional support of the people who have put in so much hard work and personal time to make sure this trip could be possible. f 
A TRIBUTE TO LT. COL. DAVID WORLEY 
HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 11, 2017 Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Lieutenant Colonel David Worley, who is retiring after forty-two years of distinguished service with the United States Air Force. Born in Los Angeles in 1953, Dave grew up in Woodland Hills, California. An excellent stu-dent and astronomy enthusiast, he attended Serrania Avenue Elementary School, Parkman Jr. High and Taft High School. Dave met his future wife, Gayle, in Sunday School, and after their high school graduation, they attended Pierce College together. In 1975, Dave en-listed in the United States Air Force (USAF) and he and Gayle married shortly after his en-listment. Upon completion of his basic training, he was assigned to the Keesler Air Force Base in Biloxi, Mississippi for technical train-ing. After finishing his technical training, he was assigned to Dover AFB for a one year as-signment. He was reassigned back to Keesler AFB in Biloxi, where their children, Valerie and Bryan were born. Dave served as an Air Traffic Controller Manager for seven years, after which he re-ceived his commission. Upon completing train-ing as an Air Battalion Manager, then-Second Lieutenant Worley was stationed in Germany

for eight years, where he served as a mobile Theater Air Control specialist and evaluator and was promoted to the subsequent ranks of First Lieutenant and Captain. In 1992, Captain Worley served as a Flight Commander at the Squadron Officer School at the Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama and in 1994, he was stationed in Korea where he was promoted to Major and worked as Battle Director for air-space control. In 1995, Major Worley returned to the Squadron Officer School as Chief of Plans and Programs, then attended college in Virginia, and after college, began a three year tour at the U.S. Central Command Head-quarters in Tampa, Florida. While in Florida, he served as the Chief of the Theater Air and Missile Defense Branch as Executive Officer to the Director of Operations, where he re-ceived the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. In 2000, Lt. Col. Worley returned once again to Alabama as Commander of the 30th Student Squadron Officers School, where he com-manded hundreds of USAF officers, inter-national officers and U.S. Department of De-fense civilian personnel as an airpower and leadership education scholar, before his retire-ment in 2002. In 2003, Dave became a Senior Aerospace Science instructor at Crescenta Valley High School in La Crescenta, California. Lt. Col. Worley was responsible for administering the Air Force Junior Officer Training Corps (AFJROTC) program, a citizenship-based pro-gram for nearly 100 high school student ‘‘ca-dets,’’ who are expanding their aerospace science and leadership education to become better leaders and citizens. During his illustrious career in the United States Air Force, Lt. Col. Worley has received several decorations including the Joint Service Commendation Medal, five Meritorious Service Medals, a Defense Meritorious Service Medal, and two USAF Commendation Medals, and was honored in 2007 and in 2008 with the AFJROTC outstanding instructor award, which is presented annually to the top twenty per-cent of all AFJROTC instructors worldwide. I ask all Members of Congress to join me in thanking Lt. Col. Worley for his many years of dedicated service to our country, the AFJROTC students at Crescenta Valley High School, and the greater foothills community.

HONORING THE JOHNSTOWN RO-TARY CLUB’S 100TH ANNIVER-SARY 
HON. KEITH J. ROTHFUS 
OF PENNSYLVANIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 11, 2017 Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the Johnstown Rotary Club’s 100th Anniversary. Since its founding in May 1917, the Johns-town Rotary Club has aided many community organizations such as scouting, child relief agencies, arts and theater organizations, po-lice and fire departments and health and serv-ice organizations. It has also sponsored Inter-act Clubs at local high schools and awarded scholarships to outstanding high school stu-dents. In addition to providing dictionaries to every third grader in the Johnstown area, Johnstown Rotarians are also involved in var-ious literacy initiatives such as the One Book, One Community Program. The Johnstown Rotary Club has also been actively involved in international service initia-tives such as supporting clean water projects in developing nations. They have been very involved in hosting high school exchange stu-dents from numerous countries including Spain, France, Slovakia, Turkey, Venezuela, Mexico, Ecuador, Argentina, Bolivia, the Do-minican Republic and Japan. Since 1968, when Rotary International first took on the challenge of eradicating polio, the Johnstown Rotary Club has participated in various projects, which helped to bring the number of countries experiencing the polio endemic from 122 down to two. I thank the Johnstown Rotarians for their dedication to improving both the Johnstown community and the international community through their commitment to supporting edu-cation, providing clean water, promoting peace, saving mothers and children, growing local economies and fighting disease. Con-gratulations to the Rotary Club of Johnstown on its 100th Anniversary. f 
IN HONOR OF THE COMMEMORA-TION OF THE GREAT FALLS LI-BRARY COMMUNITY ROOM 
HON. BARBARA COMSTOCK 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 11, 2017 Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the commemoration of the Great Falls Library Community Room in honor of Marge Gersic and also to recognize her tre-mendous contributions to not only the Great Falls Community Library, but the entire 10th District of Virginia over the course of her 20 years of public service. Growing up as the child of two German im-migrants in Queens, New York, Ms. Gersic often found herself in her local library, reading books written in English. There she not only gained an appreciation for books, but she also learned about the impact libraries can have on a community. Ms. Gersic began her work in the Great Falls community after moving to the area in 1971 with her husband and then new-born son. As both a member of the Library Board and as President of the Great Falls Citi-zens Association, she was instrumental in placing a library in Great Falls and also in pre-serving it throughout the years. In both 1989 and 1996, as a skilled and dedicated public organizer, Ms. Gersic led community movements to keep the Great Falls mini-library open amidst budget cuts that would have eliminated numerous mini-libraries across Fairfax County. By organizing drives, collecting signatures, and leading these move-ments, she was able to keep the local mini-li-brary open. In fact, during the 1996 budget cuts, four mini-libraries across Fairfax closed, but due to her initiatives the Great Falls library remained open. In addition to her efforts to preserve the library throughout the years, as a member of the Fairfax County Library Board, Gersic was also integral in the funding and the eventual expansion of the library to its current location, which opened in October of 2000. Honoring the life of Ms. Gersic with a room in the library, which she worked so hard to maintain and expand is only fitting, and I am thankful for the Great Falls Citizens Associa-tion’s dedication to preserving her legacy. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Marge Gersic and the commemora-tion of the Great Falls Library Community Room, which will serve as a permanent re-minder of all her contributions to both the li-brary and the community at large. f 
CELEBRATING THE LIFE & LEGACY OF FATHER JOHN K. RING 
HON. NANCY PELOSI 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 11, 2017 Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay trib-ute to the life and legacy of a dear friend and beloved pillar of the San Francisco commu-nity, Father John Ring, who served for 25 years as Pastor of St. Vincent de Paul Church. Born and raised in San Francisco, Father Ring’s leadership and compassion were in-valuable to our parish and our community, in times of joy and sorrow alike. In the suffering of the Loma Prieta earthquake, Father Ring bound up the wounds of our community, con-soling and encouraging us, tending his flock. During his entire Pastorate, we saw the cre-ation of a mass for young adults, a group of Home Visitors to care for the sick and home-bound in the parish and beyond, and for the first time girls were allowed to be altar servers. He also poured himself into the service of the parish’s children, and the strength of the St. Vincent de Paul school will be an enduring part of Father Ring’s rich legacy. My husband Paul, my family and I were deeply saddened to hear of Father Ring’s passing. Our family has been parishioners at St. Vincent de Paul for generations, since Paul’s parents John and Corinne Pelosi be-came parishioners in the 1930s. We count ourselves deeply blessed to have known Fa-ther Ring, and it was a special privilege to join in celebrating the Golden Jubilee of his priestly service in 2011. He will remain an in-spiration to our family. Father Ring once said that Christ’s farewell to his disciples was one of his favorite parts of Scripture. In the Gospel according to John, Jesus says, ‘‘Peace I leave with you; My peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you. Do not let your heart be trou-bled, nor let it be fearful.’’ Truly, Father Ring was an instrument of God’s peace. The families of Father Ring’s parish were blessed with a Pastor who strengthened their church and school, built community, and in-spired their love for service and their love for God. May it bring comfort to all those who loved and admired Father Ring that so many join in remembering this extraordinary man and the blessing he was to our community.

founder and CEO of DEL Records, a flour-ishing music company located in Bell Gar-dens, California, in my 40th Congressional District. Since his launch of DEL Records in 2008, Angel has built the label into a place where young and independent Regional Mexi-can artists can develop their talents and find success. Angel’s passion for music, his busi-ness acumen, and his civic and philanthropic efforts have built DEL Records into a vibrant, thriving part of the local community. DEL Records exists because of Angel’s vi-sion: he knew that the entertainment industry was full of talented artists who were not signed to a label and were not receiving the support they needed in order to build a career. When he began DEL Records, Angel spent time searching YouTube for young musicians. In the years since, his hard work has paid off: today, the label boasts a broad slate of major artists. Musicians like Gerardo Ortiz, Luis Coronel, Chiquis, Jose Manuel Lopez, and the late Ariel Camacho are just a few of those who have been a part of the DEL Records family. Angel has used his success at DEL Records as a driving force to create positive change in the community. He has been tire-less in giving back time, effort, and resources to help his neighbors. Angel and DEL Records work to lift up the less fortunate, and to give individuals of all ages the opportunity to thrive and excel. As we work to build communities that protect the vulnerable and support those in need, the good works of civic-minded com-munity leaders like Angel are invaluable to that endeavor. With the help of his sister Maria, and guided always by the inspirational example of his par-ents Jose Angel and Frances, Angel Del Villar has made DEL Records a key Southeast LA County business and a vital voice in the Re-gional Mexican music scene. I commend Angel and his team at DEL Records for their achievements in music and contributions to the community, and wish them all the best for the future.

IN RECOGNITION OF ORCHARDS CHILDRENS’ SERVICES ON ITS 55TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 11, 2017 Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Orchards Childrens’ Services as it celebrates its 55th anniversary. Orchards pro-vides critical adoption, foster parenting and family preservation services throughout south-east Michigan. Founded in 1962 by the Greater Detroit Section of the National Council of Jewish Women, Orchards Children’s Services pro-vides comprehensive services and supports to vulnerable children in the southeast Michigan community. The organization recruits, trains and licenses foster parents to provide care for children in need of these services. Addition-ally, Orchards facilitates adoptions and runs several Post Adoption Resource Centers to ensure that these children and their adoptive families receive the support and resources to help make the transition a success. The orga-nization also maintains a scholarship fund to help Orchards foster children afford a college education. Orchards’ Promise Scholarships provide critical financial support to help these children achieve success in college, and every child who receives an Orchard Promise schol-arship has achieved at least a 3.0 GPA at a Michigan University. Orchards Children’s Services has played a key role in providing resources and support to vulnerable children in the southeast Michigan community. Since the organization began its adoption program in 1986, it has helped place over 3,000 children with adoptive families. It also serves over 5,000 children through its family preservation programs, which provide assistance like household organization and other skills training to help stabilize families and keep them together. Collectively, these initiatives have helped empower children in need to reach their potential and provide them resources for success later in life, and I am confident that Orchards will continue its excel-lent work in the coming years. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Orchards Childrens’ Services on their 55th anniversary for their work on behalf of Michigan’s children. Orchards’ programs have helped support vulnerable children in southeast Michigan. f

HONORING THE KILGORE HIGH SCHOOL BULLDOGS, 2017 CLASS 4A STATE SOCCER CHAMPIONS 
HON. LOUIE GOHMERT 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 11, 2017 Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, it is with enor-mous pride that I recognize and congratulate the Kilgore High School Bulldogs on achieving the title of 2017 Texas State Soccer Cham-pions. This is the third straight appearance for the Bulldogs in the state soccer showdown, but this is Kilgore High School’s first state team title since 2004. Despite losing their team captain to injury during the state semifinals, the Bulldogs pulled together and made their way to the state final against the Bridgeport Bulls. After the end of grueling regulation play, the match was tied 2– 2, and went to penalty kicks. Two brilliant saves by keeper and championship MVP Kaleb Jett, on back-to-back shots, brought the Bulldogs a hard-earned 4–2 victory on pen-alties. Congratulations should be extended to team members Kaleb Jett, Yonatan Contreras, Jesus Gonzalez, Jovany Gonzalez, Noe Zavaleta, Raul Cedillo, Jamie Veloz, Elian Torres, Mateo Meraz, Brandon Espinoza, Dan-iel Sifford, Tucker Konczak, Jordi Contreras, Diego Huerta, Wayne McIntyre, Jose Gon-zalez, David Garcia, Jose Arrendondo, Jack-son Hatcher. This recognition of their accomplishment is extended to all of the athletic staff including Coaches: Austin Walker, Mark Roskos; Train-ers/Managers: Head Trainer, Darrell ‘‘Red’’ Ganus; Student Trainer, Brandon Mayers; Manager, Carlos Godoy; Videographer, Josue Reyes. The staff and faculty who led and in-spired the Bulldogs in pursuit of the state crown include Superintendent Cara Cooke; Principal Greg Brown; Athletic Director Mi-chael Wood; Assistant Athletic Director Doug Duke. The faculty, staff and friends of Kilgore Inde-pendent School District and the entire commu-nity of Kilgore have devoted countless hours to support and encourage these outstanding young athletes in the pursuit of their dreams. It is my most esteemed honor to congratu-late everyone involved with this endeavor. May God continue to bless these students, their families and friends, and all those individ-uals who call Kilgore, Texas their home. Con-gratulations to the 2017 Class 4A State Soc-cer Champions, the Kilgore Bulldogs, as their championship legacy is now recorded and will endure as long as there is a United States of America. f 
CELEBRATING ISRAEL INDEPENDENCE DAY 
HON. EVAN H. JENKINS 
OF WEST VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 11, 2017 Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Israel Independ-ence Celebration in my hometown of Hun-tington, West Virginia, that took place on Sun-day, May 7. This event honoring the establish-ment of one of our nation’s greatest allies was made possible by the hard work of Jewish Charities of Huntington and Christ Temple Church of Huntington. I thank Linda Klein and Pastor Chuck Lawrence for their steadfast leadership as well. Just like West Virginia, Israel’s greatest strength is the resolve and resilience of its people. I witnessed firsthand the importance of the relationship between our two countries during my recent visit to Israel, where it was evident that the nation is under threat like never before. That is why I will continue to hold the Iranian regime accountable for its nu-clear and ballistic missile programs so that it will never be able to obtain a nuclear weapon. I have also been a vocal supporter of placing stronger sanctions on Iran until it no longer fi-nancially supports terrorist groups that pose a threat to both Israel and the United States, and to providing aid and support to Israel to help it defend itself. Israel will always have a friend in the United States, and in me. I congratulate the citizens of Israel on 69 years of independence and look forward to many more years of friendship between our people.

IN RECOGNITION OF TOYOTA MOTOR NORTH AMERICA ON THE DATE OF ITS SUPPLIER CENTER GRAND OPENING 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 11, 2017 Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Toyota Motor North America on the date of the Toyota Supplier Center and Proto-type Development Facility grand opening. Toy-ota Motor North America has been a strong partner to southeast Michigan by utilizing our state’s automotive expertise to help produce its next generation of automobiles. Originally established in July 1977, Toyota Motor North America’s Research and Develop-ment has contributed significantly to the lead-ership of southeast Michigan as a leader in automotive engineering, driving important breakthroughs in automotive design and safe-ty. Toyota employs approximately 1,440 indi-viduals in its Ann Arbor and York Township fa-cilities whose work has critical input to many of Toyota’s most popular vehicles. These fa-cilities collectively have contributed to the ve-hicle development of many of Toyota’s most popular vehicles, including the 2014 Tundra and 2015 Camry designs, and its advanced research and prototype development efforts continue to serve as a critical source of inno-vation for the company at large. Toyota Motor North America’s significant in-vestment in expanding and upgrading its Ann Arbor and York Township engineering facilities underscores the importance of the groundbreaking research and development being done here. The expansion of the powertrain development facility in Ann Arbor Township, as well as further improvements to the York Township site, will allow a continu-ation of the successful partnership between Toyota and the State of Michigan. The tal-ented and educated southeast Michigan work-force, combined with Toyota’s new facilities and additional resources, will help ensure that Michigan’s automotive industry remains a worldwide leader in the coming decades. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Toyota Motor North America and Mr. Toyoda during the grand opening of the Toyota Supplier Center and Prototype Devel-opment Facility expansion. This critical invest-ment will leverage Michigan’s talented work-force to conduct cutting edge automotive re-search and development.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE GRAND OPENING OF CENTERFUSE 
HON. BARBARA COMSTOCK 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 11, 2017 Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the grand opening of CenterFuse in Manassas, Virginia, an innovative business accelerator that will allow individuals, entre-preneurs, start-up companies, and established firms to lease office space and conference rooms. This state of the art facility is equipped with brand new office and conference equip-ment, including smart televisions, fast wifi, and a fully functional kitchen. While offering some of the most modern technology, and yet at the same time being situated in Old Town Manas-sas, CenterFuse will provide the residents of Virginia’s 10th Congressional District with 24/ 7 access to a unique combination of advanced technology and a relaxed and familiar setting. The idea for CenterFuse was originally con-ceived by Gail and Bennet Whitlock, of Whitlock Financial, and Jacqueline and Ken Krick, of ECU Communications, who formed an LLC to purchase the Hyson Building in Ma-nassas on the corner of Center Street and Main Street. The two firms have their own of-fices upstairs, but below, where the Fauquier Bank once stood, they built CenterFuse. To fund the construction of CenterFuse, they formed a public-private partnership with the City of Manassas, receiving a $200,000 grant from Manassas City leaders. The day-to-day operations will be overseen by Historic Manas-sas, Inc. (HMI) and their Executive Director/ CEO, Debbie Haight, and under her leader-ship, HMI will manage the office’s front desk, organize classes and activities, and lead the recruiting efforts for new clients. In today’s competitive economy, many small companies and individuals require modern workspaces, yet often find it difficult to secure or maintain an office. CenterFuse will amelio-rate this problem by offering a variety of op-tions for businesses, ranging from year-long leases for private offices to co-working day passes. This will enable these growing busi-nesses or individuals to work in an environ-ment that caters to their specific needs. Mr. Speaker, I would ask that my colleagues join me in applauding the Grand Opening of CenterFuse. It is my hope that CenterFuse will help Virginia’s 10th Congressional District to continue to be a catalyst for new businesses to thrive. I am very thankful for the broad range of opportunities it will afford my constitu-ents and I look forward to the positive impact it will have on individuals, entrepreneurs, busi-nesses and our commonwealth as a whole. f 
IN HONOR OF MR. FREDERICK VAN HOOSE’S FORTY YEARS OF SERVICE 
HON. PRAMILA JAYAPAL 
OF WASHINGTON  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 11, 2017 Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Frederick Van Hoose, Executive Director of the Northwest Field Office of SourceAmerica, who is retiring after 40 years of service. Mr. Van Hoose grew up in the agricultural heartland of eastern Washington, where he learned at a young age the value of honest work. He also came to understand work as a social connection—an activity that, in bringing people together for a common purpose, vali-dates our collective worth and impact on each other. After receiving his bachelor’s degree from Central Washington University and his MBA from City University of Seattle, Mr. Van Hoose built a career centered on the needs of persons living with disabilities. As an executive manager at Provident Industries in Yakima, Washington, and Northwest Center Industries in Seattle, he developed employment opportu-nities that increased the quality of life for hun-dreds of workers with disabilities. In March 1997, Mr. Van Hoose secured a position as an Operations Manager with Na-tional Industries for the Severely Handi-capped—now SourceAmerica—a non-profit agency that works through the provisions of the Javits-Wagner-O’Day Act to facilitate meaningful employment for persons living with disabilities. Mr. Van Hoose has helped scores of non-profit agencies build business systems to expand their capacity to compete for con-tracts, and he has worked with Federal pro-curement professionals to find contracting so-lutions that enhanced the double bottom line: quality services and products for a fair price, while supporting access to employment for persons living with disabilities. During his tenure with SourceAmerica, Mr. Van Hoose has served as a model of the self-less spirit and inspired leadership that has helped the program grow to employ many indi-viduals living with the full range of disabling conditions, including many wounded warriors. Mr. Van Hoose’s dedication to enhancing the lives of Americans living with disabilities ex-tends to his personal life, as he serves as guardian to a man living with a severe dis-ability. For his years of dedicated service, it is ap-propriate to express our deep appreciation for Frederick Van Hoose’s long and exceptional career and his outstanding volunteer service, and to wish him well on his retirement. f 
CONGRATULATING NIEMANN FOODS’ 100TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. DARIN LaHOOD 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 11, 2017 Mr. L
AHOOD. Mr. Speaker, today, I would like to honor Niemann Foods as they cele-brate one hundred years of business. In 1917, brothers Ferd Sr. and Steve Niemann achieved the American dream by opening their first grocery store, Niemann Brothers, in Quincy, Illinois. By providing qual-ity produce, goods, and customer service, the Niemanns afforded the opportunity to expand their operations to thirty grocery stores by 1930. One decade later, the Neimann brothers opened Quincy’s first full service supermarket, Food Center, which was open seven days a week. Food Center became the heart of the town and was the beginning of the area’s modern shopping tradition. Today, Niemann Foods, an ESOP company, provides employ-ment for over 5000 hard-working people spread throughout their retail banners, which include County Market, Save-A-Lot, Ace Hard-ware, Pet Supplies Plus and Haymakers con-venience stores. As the Niemann tradition continues to thrive, consumers can find their quality products and customer service at more than one hundred stores all across the Mid-west. For one hundred years, Niemann Foods has given back to their community through hard work, generosity, and their commitment to helping others. Without a doubt, Niemann Foods is a staple of Illinois’ 18th District and I am proud to consider them our neighbors. Congratulations to Niemann Foods on a pros-perous century and I wish them one hundred more years of success.

IN RECOGNITION OF BYRON BUNK-ER FOR BEING NAMED A FINAL-IST FOR THE SAMUEL J. HEYMAN SERVICE TO AMERICA MEDAL 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 11, 2017 Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Byron Bunker for being named a fi-nalist for the Samuel J. Heyman Service to America Medal. Mr. Bunker’s work as Director of Compliance Programs for the Environ-mental Protection Agency was key to uncover-ing Volkswagen Group’s automotive emissions evasion scheme and safeguarding public health. Since 1999, Mr. Bunker has worked for the EPA’s National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory in Ann Arbor, Michigan, which con-ducts tests to certify that vehicles and engines meet the United States’ emissions and fuel economy standards. As Director of the NVFEL’s Compliance Division, Mr. Bunker tests automobiles and their components to en-sure that they comply with clean air regula-tions. Working in conjunction with academic researchers and other federal officials, Mr. Bunker helped uncover and halt a scheme by Volkswagen to evade emissions standards through the use of software designed to inten-tionally fool regulators about the true emis-sions levels of its diesel vehicles. This dis-covery eventually resulted in the largest pen-alty ever levied against a car manufacturer and helped lay the foundation for additional criminal investigations. These have resulted in $4.3 billion in civil and criminal penalties, as well as indictments against Volkswagen ex-ecutives. Mr. Bunker’s expertise and tireless efforts played a critical role in uncovering this wrong-doing and underscore the importance of the EPA’s enforcement efforts. As a result of Mr. Bunker’s work, the EPA was not only able to detect a sophisticated and widespread emis-sions evasion scheme, but also strengthen its testing procedures to prevent similar decep-tions in the future. Through his rigorous work and collaboration with other officials in the EPA, Mr. Bunker has been an important driver of efforts to protect Americans’ health and the environment, and it is my hope that he con-tinues to effectively safeguard public health and safety in the years ahead. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Byron Bunker for being named a finalist for the Samuel J. Heyman Service to America Medal. Mr. Bunker’s rigorous enforce-ment work has been important in protecting public health and safety.

HON. LOU BARLETTA

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 11, 2017 Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, it is with great pride that I honor my good friend, Neal DeAngelo, and congratulate him on being named the 2017 Distinguished Citizen of the Year by the Greater Hazleton Area Boy Scouts. With years of success with his family business, and his commitment to giving back to Hazleton and the broader community of Pennsylvania’s 11th district, it comes as no surprise to me that he has been chosen to re-ceive this honor. Neal has been an instrumental figure in the Hazleton community. I can say with certainty that there are few people who have done as much for Hazleton as Neal. He has served on the boards of several non-profit organizations, including the YMCA and United Way. He has also served as the President of the Profes-sional Lawn Care Association of America, and is a founding member of the State Associa-tion, for which he also served as President. Neal has been a longtime supporter of Scout-ing in the Greater Hazleton Area. Through his generosity and commitment, Neal has helped make a positive difference in the lives of more than 500 young men throughout our commu-nity, providing them with an opportunity to par-ticipate in Scouting’s character-building and leadership programs. Not only is Neal one of the most charitable people I know, he is also a well-respected businessman. Neal co-founded DBI Services with his brother in 1978 and grew the com-pany into an international diversified services enterprise, exceeding $250 million annually with a global network of over 50 locations and 1,800 employees. His hard work made it pos-sible for his company to spur growth in and bring quality service to Hazleton, as well as the rest of the Commonwealth. Mr. Speaker, please join me in recognizing Neal for all he has contributed to the Hazleton community and once again congratulating him on being recognized as the Greater Hazleton Area Boy Scouts’ 2017 Distinguished Citizen of the Year. f

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 11, 2017 Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life of Francis R. Ludovici, a beloved member of the Upper Southampton, Pennsylvania community who passed away on Saturday April 29, 2017. Mr. Ludovici—Frankie to his friends—was a Combat Engineer in the U.S. Army Reserve, a builder, a business owner, and a family man. When he wasn’t renovating and flipping houses, his passion, he was selling pinball machines and poker tables, a business he took over from his father before him. Frankie loved his community in Upper Southampton and they loved him back. His presence will be greatly missed but his contributions will be felt for generations to come.

HONORING DR. MANUEL BACA 
HON. GRACE F. NAPOLITANO 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 11, 2017 Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the long career of public service pro-vided by an outstanding educator in my re-gion, Dr. Manuel Baca, who has served the students, staff, and faculty of Rio Hondo Col-lege with distinction for the past 32 years. Dr. Baca has been an invaluable resource to me and my staff, and will be truly missed at Rio Hondo College. Dr. Baca has served in many capacities as Professor of Political Science, Director, Dean, Vice President, and Interim Superintendent/President of Rio Hondo College. He also serves on the Board of Trust-ees of one of the largest community colleges in the Country, Mt. San Antonio College, and is the immediate past President of the Cali-fornia Community Colleges Board of Gov-ernors. I have been privileged to work with Dr. Baca in numerous areas that have improved edu-cational opportunities for students and the needs of our region. We have worked together on expanding transit services to the student body and staff by offering free and reduced price transit passes and buying shuttle buses for enhanced connectivity, Dr. Baca has sup-ported the growth of Rio Hondo College’s po-lice, fire and first responder training programs that have benefited the greater Los Angeles Community by providing a well-educated work-force for our public safety agencies. I am particularly thankful for the work Dr. Baca has done to increase educational oppor-tunities at Rio Hondo College for veterans. As a veteran of the United States Marine Corps, Dr. Baca understood the important role Rio Hondo College could play in helping post-9/11 veterans and all veterans receive workforce training and other services to start new ca-reers and assimilate into civilian life. In addi-tion, Dr. Baca has assisted in organizing vet-eran student summits throughout the State of California. Our nation is grateful for Dr. Baca’s service as a Marine and his continued service to the men and women of our military. Dr. Baca has been a role model and leader in opening up opportunities for Latino/a stu-dents by advocating for legislation at the state and federal level to support Hispanic-Serving Institutions. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the Rio Hondo College Community and the many people he has impacted in the greater Los Angeles Re-gion, I ask my colleagues to join me in con-gratulating Dr. Manuel Baca on his retirement, and thanking him for his long career of public service to Rio Hondo College, the State of California and our nation. f

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 11, 2017 Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Women’s Center of South-eastern Michigan as the community gathers to celebrate all the good work it performs.

it. The organization combined with several other service-oriented groups over the years to better serve its constituency of women in need while continuing to offer low-cost, women-friendly counseling and support serv-ices. Today, the Women’s Center, based out of Ann Arbor, Michigan, builds on this legacy, offering divorce support, job coaching, per-sonal counseling, and other services through its staff of social workers, graduate interns and community volunteers. Collectively, these indi-viduals help the Women’s Center provide di-rect services to approximately 500 individuals each year, as well as referral services to over 1,000 other individuals to access additional community resources. The assistance provided by the staff and volunteers of the Women’s Center provides professional services that build confidence, strengthen connections and create positive en-ergy. Women find a network and gain access at a low affordable cost to therapists, job coaches, legal aid, divorce specialists, finan-cial advisors and other important tools they need for support and success. The Women’s Center’s unique approach and comprehensive resources have empowered countless women to address issues in a confidential and spe-cialized setting, and it is my hope that the Center continues to build on its legacy of suc-cess. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the Women’s Center of South-eastern Michigan on its 17th annual Swing into Spring fundraiser. The Women’s Center offers important services and supports to women in need.

RECOGNIZING THE NATIONAL ROOFING CONTRACTORS ASSO-CIATION AND NATIONAL ROOF-ING WEEK 
HON. RANDY HULTGREN 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 11, 2017 Mr. HULTGREN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the National Roofing Contractors Association (NRCA) headquartered in Rose-mont, Illinois, and its efforts to designate the week of June 4–10, 2017 as National Roofing Week. The roof is one of the most important com-ponents of any home or business. It is the first line of defense against natural elements, such as rain, snow or wind, and yet it is often taken for granted until it falls into disrepair. National Roofing Week honors the thousands of roofing contractors and roofing-related businesses across the country and the industry’s commit-ment to public service. National Roofing Week is a valuable reminder of the significance qual-ity roofing has on every home and business in the United States. Established in 1886, NRCA is one of the na-tion’s oldest trade associations and the voice of professional roofing contractors worldwide. Today, the NRCA has more than 3,800 mem-bers located across all 50 states and rep-resents a variety of industry stakeholders, in-cluding roofing, roof deck, and water proofing contractors. Using its vast network of roofing contractors and industry-related members, NRCA is responsible for the installation of a majority of new construction and replacement roof systems on commercial and residential structures in America. Most of its members are small, privately-held businesses that pro-vide high-paying jobs for thousands of hard- working families and individuals that are the backbone of our economy. Professional roofing contractors provide vital services to their communities, both on and off the clock, in all 50 states. NRCA members will recognize National Roofing Week on June 4– 10 by supporting numerous charitable commu-nity service roofing projects throughout the na-tion. I commend the NRCA and the vital role the organization and its members play in every community and I ask all my colleagues to join me in acknowledging their contributions during National Roofing Week. f 
INTRODUCTION OF THE ‘‘KEEP OUR PENSION PROMISES ACT’’ 
HON. MARCY KAPTUR 
OF OHIO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 11, 2017 Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, today I reintro-duce the Keep Our Pension Promises Act to reinstate the long standing federal law and principal that prohibited cuts to private pension benefits in plans for retirees. Pensions are one of the surest means to af-ford millions of middle class families’ security in retirement. They have allowed millions of Americans to enjoy their golden years without fear that they have not saved enough. For decades, pensions guaranteed our senior citi-zens the peace of mind that a check would ar-rive every month for as long as they live: this is true retirement security. But in December 2014, Congress uprooted this security for millions of retirees. At the last minute, in a must pass funding bill, Congress included the Multiemployer Pension Reform Act (MPRA) eviscerating this protection. With little understanding of what the provisions meant, Congress changed a forty year old pension law that ensured retirees were given the highest level of pension-defense. The Em-ployee Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA, allowed for pension benefits in multi-employer plans to be cut only when a plan runs out of money—and even then, the retiree benefits should face cuts last. This held true because it was the right thing to do. Pensions are not handouts, they are de-ferred wages earned over a lifetime of hard work. An estimated 1.5 million participants, in-cluding retirees, are in multiemployer pension plans that are in danger of running out of money in the near future. The passage of MPRA allowed for the first time, benefits of current retirees to be cut in an attempt to ad-dress the fiscal distress confronting some of these multiemployer plans. This was wrong then, and remains a blem-ish on the Congressional record that little ac-tion has been taken to correct the undue bur-den it placed on retirees. That’s why today I introduce the ‘‘Keep Our Pension Promises Act’’ with Senator B
ERNIE SANDERS of Vermont. This Act corrects the injustices bestowed upon our most vulnerable retirees by restoring anti-cutback rules so retirees in financially troubled multiemployer pension plans are pro-tected from having their earned benefits cut. It will allow plans to partition off ‘‘orphaned’’ participants into a separate plan, giving partici-pating employers relief from shouldering the full financial burden and risk of underfunded ‘‘orphaned’’ participants—ensuring the ability for plans to become financially secure once more. This bill recognizes funding is the ultimate concern. It shores up the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp and creates a legacy fund to ensure participants in partitioned plans will continue to receive the benefits they depend upon. The costs to create this fund are cov-ered by closing tax loopholes the very wealthy use to avoid taxes on like-kind exchanges and supersized IRA accounts that hold millions, despite laws that limit accounts to much small-er tax deductible amounts. Further the bill ensures pension obligations are prioritized during bankruptcies, which will help the remaining employers in the plan by making it less likely they become responsible for underfunded orphan plans. Over the past few years the retirees facing these cuts mobilized. They organized dozens of committees to spread the message of how damaging the Multiemployer Pension Reform Act has and will be to their lives and financial security. The Keep Our Pension Promises Act recognizes shared sacrifice is the appropriate course of action to save the golden years of retirement for these retirees. I encourage my colleagues to support this measure and cor-rect the misguided action of passage of the Multiemployer Pension Reform Act. f 
IN RECOGNITION OF JAYNE HOMCO FOR HER DISTINGUISHED CA-REER AND WORK IN THE COM-MUNITY 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 11, 2017 Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Jayne Homco for her outstanding achievements and career with Kroger Co. As president of Kroger’s Michigan division, Ms. Homco’s leadership and business expertise have helped make Kroger one of America’s premier companies. After graduating from Indiana University, Ms. Homco joined Kroger in 1978 and has served with the company in a variety of roles. She was named co-manager of an Indianap-olis store before she turned thirty, and has held management positions with five different divisions within the company across six states. Prior to being named president of Kroger Michigan, Ms. Homco served as vice president of merchandising for Kroger’s Southwest divi-sion, where she oversaw merchandising for over 200 Kroger supermarkets. In her current role, Ms. Homco leads a division of 16,000 Michigan employees across over 100 stores, which collectively account for billions of dollars in revenue each year. Ms. Homco’s pioneering career has helped her break down barriers for women in the workplace while providing outstanding leader-ship for Kroger Co. During her career, Ms. Homco became the first woman vice president at Kroger’s Dillion’s and QFC divisions. Addi-tionally, she is active in the Michigan business community, serving as a board member of the

Ms. Homco’s ability to leverage her business experience and management skills on behalf of Michigan has helped make it a great place to live and work, and I have confidence that she will continue to lead in business and in the community in the coming years. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Jayne Homco for her work with Kroger Co. and in the community. Ms. Homco has been an effective leader as President of Kroger’s Michigan Division while working on behalf of the southeast Michigan community.

INTRODUCTION OF THE PAY EQUITY FOR ALL ACT OF 2017 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 11, 2017 Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise to intro-duce the Pay Equity for All Act of 2017, a bill that will help eliminate the gender and racial pay gap by prohibiting employers from asking job applicants for their salary history before making a job or salary offer. Representatives R
OSA DELAURO , JERROLD NADLER , and J ACKIE  S
PEIER are original cosponsors of the bill. Even though many employers may not inten-tionally discriminate against applicants or em-ployees based on gender, race or ethnicity, setting wages based on salary history can re-inforce the wage gap. Members of historically disadvantaged groups often start out their ca-reers with unfair and artificially low wages compared to their white male counterparts, and the disparities are compounded from job to job throughout their careers. Our bill will ensure that applicants’ salaries are based on their skills and merit, not on a potentially problematic salary history, by as-sessing penalties against employers who ask applicants for their salary history during the interview process or as a condition of employ-ment. It would also provide job applicants and employees with a private right of action against employers who violate these provi-sions. Although the wage gap has decreased for some women, it still persists for women and men of color with similar skill sets. There is much work to be done to address the wage gap for everyone, and our bill is just one step toward that goal. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

HONORING THE DEDICATED SERV-ICE AND SELFLESS SACRIFICE OF STAFF SERGEANT MARK R. DE ALENCAR 
HON. MATT GAETZ 
OF FLORIDA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 11, 2017 Mr. GAETZ. Mr. Speaker, it is with both pro-found sadness and deep gratitude that I rise to pay tribute to a fallen decorated American hero. On April 8, 2017, Staff Sergeant Mark R. De Alencar, who was assigned to Bravo Com-pany, 1st Battalion, 7th Special Forces Group, Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, tragically suc-cumbed to injuries received from small arms fire in support of Operation Freedom’s Sen-tinel in Nangarhar Province, Afghanistan. Staff Sgt. De Alencar was 37 years old, but lived a lifetime marked by and full of service. Born in a U.S. Army hospital in Nuremburg, Germany, Staff Sgt. De Alencar’s childhood followed his father’s military career. Grad-uating from Joppatowne High School, Joppa, Maryland, in 1998, he then worked odd jobs before becoming a carpenter. But it was in 2009, that he choose to follow in his father’s footsteps and joined the U.S. Army. After attending Basic Combat Training and Cannon Crewmember (13B) Advanced Indi-vidual Training (AIT) at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, Staff Sgt. De Alencar was assigned to Bravo Battery, 2nd Battalion, 11th Field Artillery Regiment, 2nd Stryker Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division at Schofield Barracks, Hawaii. After arrival, he was deployed in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation New Dawn. Staff Sgt. De Alencar later attended Ranger School, graduated, and re-classed as an Infantryman (11B). During his time at Schofield Barracks, he served as Fire Team Leader, Rifle Squad Leader, and attended multiple training events with partnered forces throughout the Pacific; including Australian Jungle Operations, Operation Cobra Gold in Thailand, and multiple rotations to the National Training Center in Fort Irwin, California. In September 2016, Staff Sgt. De Alencar graduated from the Special Operations Quali-fication Course earning the qualification as a Weapons Sergeant (18B) and was assigned to Bravo Company, 1st Battalion, 7th Special Forces Group (Airborne) located at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida. Staff Sgt. De Alencar’s military education in-cludes Basic Leaders Course, Advanced Leaders Course, Jungle Operations Course, Ranger School, Airborne School, Air Assault School, Special Forces Qualification Course, and Survival Evasion Resistance and Escape School. Staff Sgt. De Alencar’s awards and decora-tions include the Army Commendation Medal with five Oak Leaf Clusters, Army Achieve-ment Medal with 6 Oak Leaf Clusters, Meri-torious Unit Citation, Army Good Conduct Medal, National Defense Service Medal, Iraqi Campaign Medal with two Campaign Stars, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, Non Commissioned Officer Professional Develop-ment Ribbon, Army Service Ribbon, Overseas Service Ribbon, Expert Infantryman’s Badge, Special Forces Tab, Ranger Tab, B Badge, and the Drivers Badge. As exemplified by his extraordinary heroism, Staff Sgt. De Alencar’s life stands as a testa-ment that freedom is not free, and his legacy will echo in time as an example of the ultimate sacrifice made in the name of freedom On be-half of a humble and grateful Nation, I hope the De Alencar family will find solace in know-ing their support, love, and counsel helped make him the hero he became both in uniform and as a father. I pray that God will be with Mark’s wife, Natasha; sons, Rodrigo and Marcos; stepson, Deshaun; daughter, Tatiyana; stepdaughter, Octavia and all their family and friends during this time of great mourning and may God continue to bless the United States of America. f 
IN RECOGNITION OF KEN FISCHER FOR 30 YEARS OF SERVICE ON BEHALF OF THE UNIVERSITY MUSICAL SOCIETY 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, May 11, 2017 Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ken Fischer for his 30 years as President of the University of Michigan’s Uni-versity Musical Society. Under Mr. Fischer’s leadership, UMS has become one of the lead-ing performing arts organizations in the coun-try, brought some of the world’s top per-formers and artists to the University of Michi-gan, and provided unparalleled cultural and ar-tistic opportunities at the University and to the southeast Michigan community. Mr. Fischer has been the President of UMS since 1987. During these years, Mr. Fischer has helped the UMS grow and expand its ar-tistic offerings to the wider southeast Michigan community by attracting world-class per-formers to UMS, including the Royal Shake-speare Company and the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra. In addition, UMS has partnered with local communities to expand access to the arts. He has done extensive work with metro Detroit’s Arab American community, which launched a multiyear program to show-case art from different regions and cultures. Under Mr. Fischer’s direction, UMS has also commissioned many new works, sponsored artist residences, and organized collaborative performances with local, national and inter-national artists. Mr. Fischer’s outstanding tenure has posi-tioned UMS for success in the coming years. In addition to introducing new programs and expanding the organization’s outreach to stu-dents and new members of the southeast Michigan community, Mr. Fischer has also grown the organization’s development efforts to support these new initiatives. Since appoint-ing Mr. Fischer as President, UMS’s budget has increased fourfold, allowing it to reach new audiences. Mr. Fischer has also worked to further intercultural understanding by serv-ing as a speaker and cultural ambassador to Brazil, China, Lithuania and Mexico under the direction of the U.S. State Department. Be-cause of Mr. Fischer’s outstanding leadership for three decades, UMS was chosen as a 2014 recipient of the National Medal of the Arts, which is awarded by the President of the United States to organizations that have dem-onstrated artistic excellence. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Ken Fischer for his 30 years of success as President of the University of Michigan’s University Musical Society. Mr. Fischer talent and passion for the arts has built a world-class organization that offers ac-cess to artistic performances to a variety of audiences.
