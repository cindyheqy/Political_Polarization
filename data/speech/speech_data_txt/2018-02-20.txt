PRAYER Reverend Michael Wilker, Lutheran Church of the Reformation, Wash-ington, D.C., offered the following prayer: During this first week in the Chris-tian season of Lent, let us begin this day turning to God and our neighbor to confess our sin. Most holy and merciful God, we con-fess to You and to one another, and be-fore the whole company of heaven, that we have sinned by our fault, by our own fault, by our own most grievous fault, in thought, word, and deed, by what we have done and by what we have left undone. We have not loved You with our whole heart, and mind, and strength. We have not forgiven and freed oth-ers as we have been forgiven and freed. Restore us, O God, and let Your anger depart from us. Accomplish in us the work of Your salvation. Have mercy on us, almighty God. Forgive us all our sins, strengthen us in all goodness, and keep us in eternal life. Amen.

A TRIBUTE TO THE LIFE AND SERVICE OF JEFF BELL 
HON. PAUL D. RYAN 
OF WISCONSIN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, February 20, 2018 Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the life of Jeffrey L. Bell, an Army veteran and prominent conserv-ative leader who passed away on February 10, 2018. I extend the deepest condolences of the whole House to the Bell family, most espe-cially his wife, Rosalie, and their four children. Jeff Bell’s many contributions to politics and public policy date back half a century. He was a heavyweight in the conservative movement before it even was a movement. His ideas, and the passion with which he espoused them, paved the way for the Reagan Revolu-tion. He was an integral part of President Rea-gan’s campaigns, and worked with my mentor, Jack Kemp, to develop the policy agenda that would bring the nation great prosperity and end the Cold War. His work spanned, and inspired, genera-tions. Jeff ran for U.S. Senate in New Jersey twice, in 1978 and 2014. He published two in-fluential books, in 1992 and 2012. To the last, he remained at the forefront, one of the most original voices for inclusive, aspirational con-servatism. Indeed, I count myself among the many who learned so much from this man. We first met in the early 1990s, and I have looked up to him ever since. Beyond the depth of his think-ing, I was always struck by how decent and gracious Jeff was to everyone he encoun-tered—the epitome of a happy warrior. It was such an honor to know him. God bless the memory of Jeff Bell, the fam-ily that he loved so dearly, and this great country that he served so well and faithfully.

RECOGNIZING JAMES (JIM) BERNEY M
CMILLAN, JR. ON THE OCCASION OF HIS 90TH BIRTH-DAY 
HON. MARK DeSAULNIER 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, February 20, 2018 Mr. D
ESAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Mr. James (Jim) Berney McMillan, Jr., on the occasion of his 90th Birthday. Jim is a longtime resident of and small business owner in Richmond, California. Jim McMillan was the first African American student and graduate from the College of Pharmacy at Oregon State. He was the sec-ond African American Oregon State Graduate, after William Maxwell. When he enrolled in 1948, only one African American had grad-uated from Oregon State in any field. At that time, there were only two African Americans on the entire campus of about 6,000 students. While at Oregon State, McMillan worked on trains traveling between Portland and Oakland during summers to support his college studies. Jim moved to Berkeley after graduation be-cause he found that no pharmacy in Portland, Oregon was willing to hire an African Amer-ican pharmacist. In 1958, he opened McMil-lan’s Pharmacy on l0th Street in Richmond, California. Jim ran McMillan’s Pharmacy on Cutting Blvd. for 28 years, closing in 1996. McMillan was elected to the Richmond City Council in 1982 and took his seat in early 1983. He served three consecutive terms, re-tiring in 1995. Though he retired from the council in 1996, he has remained an active leader. He is a Golden Heritage and Lifetime member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, a member of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, a founder of the Richmond Black American Political Action Committee, served on the Zhoushan China Sister City Commis-sion, served on the Board of Directors of the West County Housing Corporation and volun-teers on the Citizens Advisory Committee on toxic pollution for the Port of Richmond. Also served on the City of Richmond Library Com-mission. I congratulate Jim on his lifetime of achieve-ments and wish him the very best in the fu-ture. f 
HONORING THE LIFE AND DEDI-CATED SERVICE OF SHEILA OLSEN OF IDAHO FALLS 
HON. MICHAEL K. SIMPSON 
OF IDAHO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, February 20, 2018 Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in remembrance and celebration for a lady who spent her days on this Earth, serving her com-munity. Sheila Olsen, of Idaho Falls, passed away on Sunday, and she will be deeply missed. She was a patriot of this nation who made life better for those in my district, the state of Idaho, and this nation. Sheila was an inspira-tion to many in her community. Many looked to her as an example of enduring the difficul-ties of life, with optimism and joy. She was di-agnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1967 when she was pregnant with her fifth child. Although this provided many challenges to her health, she only increased in her desire to make this world a better place. Sheila had a deep love for this nation. Her career in politics included a longtime member of the Idaho Republican Women, Republican Precinct committeewoman (30 years) and vice-chair and member of the Idaho Region VII Republican Party. She cultivated a keen understanding of what constituents needed in candidates, and how a candidate could fulfill such needs. Because of this knowledge, she played key roles in the campaigns of leaders such as; U.S. Senator M
IKECRAPO (1992, 2016), Governor Butch Otter (1994, 2006, 2010 and 2014), Superintendent Tom Luna (2006), U.S. Senator Larry Craig (1990), Gov-ernor Phil Batt (2002) and several others. She was currently serving as the Bonneville Coun-ty coordinator for the Brad Little for Governor campaign. For more than 20 years, Sheila held an an-nual Fourth of July flag-raising ceremony using the flagpole in her front lawn. Through the years this event attracted friends and fam-ily, local and statewide elected officials, and many others who wished to pay tribute to those who had given the ultimate sacrifice for our freedoms. Sheila had the ability to build bridges of friendship and engage in constructive discus-sions, with those of differing beliefs. Many times, Sheila united members of different faiths, to join together in humanitarian projects. She also served on the Executive Committee of the Greater Idaho Falls Public Affairs Council as a liaison between the media and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. She was frequently asked and en-trusted to provide her insight and views to the media with regard to sensitive issues involving religion, faith and politics. She was the recipient of numerous awards, including the President’s Award, Community Human Rights Activist by Lockheed Martin, Service to Family Award by Brigham Young University, Exemplary Citizen by the Rotary Club, Woman of Distinction by Zonta, Who’s Who in American Politics and National MS Mother of the Year by President George H.W. Bush. Despite all of the awards and accolades that have come her way, Sheila will be remem-bered for the personal relationship that she built with anyone she came in contact with. Our nation is a better place because of Sheila Olsen. Mr. Speaker, I send my condolences to Sheila’s family and express my appreciation for the exceptional life she lived and the serv-ice she rendered in Idaho. On behalf of a grateful state, I honor her legacy. f

A TRIBUTE TO THE SOROPTIMIST INTERNATIONAL OF GLENDALE 
HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, February 20, 2018 Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Soroptimist International of Glendale upon its seventy-fifth anniversary. With approximately 76,000 members in over 120 countries, Soroptimist International is a global women’s organization targeted at em-powering women both socially and economi-cally. The organization is not only a respected authority on women’s issues, it is also the only women’s service club that has consultative status with the Economic and Social Council at the United Nations. Among its many worthwhile endeavors, So-roptimist International provides financial sup-port to allow women to improve their skills and employment prospects. Each year, Soroptimist International awards more than $1.6 million in education grants to more than 1,200 women, many of whom have overcome domestic vio-lence, poverty and drug and alcohol abuse. Since its founding on April 16, 1943, the Glendale chapter has continued the great work of this far-reaching organization. Estab-lished fourteen years ago by member Kathy Lefkovits, Bras for a Cause is an event where members decorate bras to raise funds for the Glendale club. Funds raised have benefited charities that enrich the lives of women and girls, including Breast Cancer Services at Glendale Adventist Medical Center, Verdugo Hills Hospital and Glendale Memorial Hospital. The assistance that Soroptimist International of Glendale has provided to the community is outstanding, and the residents of the Los An-geles area have benefited greatly from their exceptional efforts. At this time, I ask all mem-bers to join with me in commending the So-roptimist International of Glendale for its sev-enty-five years of dedicated service to the Los Angeles community.

HONORING THE LIFE OF OFFICER CHASE MADDOX 
HON. JODY B. HICE 
OF GEORGIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, February 20, 2018 Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of Offi-cer Chase Maddox, a brave Locust Grove Po-lice Department officer who was killed on Feb-ruary 9, 2018, while assisting two Henry County Sheriff deputies who were dispatched to answer a minor, routine call that turned vio-lent. Mr. Speaker, Chase Maddox, a graduate of Ola High School in McDonough, Georgia, was only 26 years old when his life was taken. Known as a smart and charismatic young man, Officer Maddox dedicated himself to his family and service to our community. He leaves behind his wife, Alex, and two young sons, one of whom was delivered just four days after Chase passed away. I’m praying for his widow, that precious new life, their family, and future, and I know that I am joined by many, many more whose hearts also go out to this grieving, young family. Mr. Speaker, on Saturday, hundreds of mourners filled pews, hallways, and overflow rooms at Glen Haven Baptist Church, standing in salute to this fallen officer. The outreach from family, friends, and strangers in the area has been overwhelming, and I’m proud of the fortitude and encouragement displayed by our neighborhood. Mr. Speaker, our law enforcement officers deserve the respect of all Americans for put-ting their lives on the line on a daily basis in order to keep us safe. I ask my colleagues to join me in a moment of silence and prayer to honor the life of Officer Chase Maddox, who will be sorely issed by so many in the 10th District of Georgia. f 
CONGRATULATING BETH ZACHARY, SENIOR VICE PRESI-DENT, ADVENTIST HEALTH, AND PRESIDENT AND CEO, ADVENT-IST HEALTH, SOUTHERN CALI-FORNIA REGION 
HON. LUCILLE ROYBAL-ALLARD 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, February 20, 2018 Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Beth Zachary on her retirement from Adventist Health. Since 2011, she has led the Adventist Health Southern California Region (AHSCR), and for the past three years has served as its President and CEO, chairing the hospital boards at Adventist Health (AH) Bakersfield, Glendale, Simi Valley, and White Memorial. After a 37-year career of outstanding commit-ment and dedication at Adventist Health, Beth officially retired on January 31, 2018. A successful health care services executive, Beth Zachary has spent over thirty years in health care services, business development, and marketing and communications. As Presi-dent and CEO of the AHSCR, she was com-mitted to coordinating care, eliminating redundancies, reducing costs, optimizing re-sources, and producing outstanding outcomes throughout the region, on behalf of a health care environment that increasingly rewards ef-ficiency and coordination. The AHSCR is com-prised of Glendale Adventist Medical Center, Simi Valley Hospital, San Joaquin Community Hospital, and White Memorial Medical Center. Previously, as President and CEO of White Memorial Medical Center, a 353-bed not-for- profit teaching hospital in the densely popu-lated community of Boyle Heights just east of downtown Los Angeles, Beth’s positive influ-ence, keen business sense, and community commitments were a significant driving force behind the hospital’s growth into one of the most advanced medical centers in the greater Los Angeles region. Under Beth’s leadership, White Memorial completed a ten-year campus rebuilding project. The new hospital not only provides state-of-the-art technology and services, it also meets California’s rigorous new seismic safety standards. Beth guided the vision and strategic direc-tion of White Memorial, and oversaw success-ful efforts to put the hospital at the forefront of clinical quality, service, and leadership among healthcare organizations. White Memorial has been identified as one of California’s top per-formers in organizational excellence and qual-ity, earning multiple awards and other recogni-tion for exceptional performance and for dedi-cation to continuous improvement. Additionally, under Beth’s leadership, White Memorial developed numerous community partnerships to meet critical local needs. These included a scholarship program with The East Los Angeles Community Union (TELACU) and Rio Hondo College that bene-fits youth and has helped ease the region’s nursing shortage. Beth participated on the boards of a number of state and regional organizations that focus on strengthening health care services, includ-ing the Private Essential Access Community Hospitals (PEACH). In addition, she partici-pated on the boards of AH Physicians Net-work, AH Physicians Network-IPA, Glendale Adventist Medical Center, San Joaquin Com-munity Hospital, Simi Valley Hospital, White Memorial Medical Center, and White Memorial Charitable Foundation. Beth resides in Pasadena with her husband Jim and their daughter Alexandra, and she holds a master’s degree in management from Claremont Graduate School in Claremont, California. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in thanking and congratulating Beth Zachary for her many years of exemplary leadership and outstanding service to our community. Let us wish her many happy years of retirement.

PERSONAL EXPLANATION 
HON. LUIS V. GUTIE´RREZ 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, February 20, 2018 Mr. GUTIE´RREZ. Mr. Speaker, I was un-avoidably absent in the House chamber for roll call votes 79 and 80 on Thursday, February 15, 2018. Had I been present, I would have voted ‘‘Yea’’ on roll call vote 79 and ‘‘Nay’’ on roll call vote 80. Had I been present for roll call vote 80, on final passage of the ADA Education and Re-form Act of 2017 (H.R. 620), I would have voted nay due to the vast setbacks this bill poses for the disability community. As a civil rights issue, the ADA Education and Reform Act would gut protections and key enforce-ments for an already vulnerable population. The onus falls on businesses to be proactive and to follow proper guidelines to ensure ac-cess for all. I particularly find troubling the ‘‘no-tice and cure’’ provisions detailed in the bill, which allows businesses to postpone compli-ance and fundamentally changes the Amer-ican with Disabilities Act.
