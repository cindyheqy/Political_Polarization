PRAYER Reverend Dr. Dan C. Cummins, Peo-ples Church, Jacksonville, Texas, of-fered the following prayer: Heavenly Father, Creator of Heaven and Earth, Redeemer and Sustainer of Life, this season of Hanukkah and Christmas may we never forget: ‘‘Little is much when God is in it.’’ A little oil in the Temple Menorah should not have lasted 8 days, but it did. A widow’s small jars of oil and flour should not have lasted almost 3 years, but they did. They did because You, Father, were in it, in the Meno-rah, in the jars. The little town of Bethlehem was not supposed to bring forth a King, but it did. A young virgin could not give birth to the Son of God, but she did. They did because You, Father, were in it, in a village, in a virgin. Father, when we feel so little, remind us again that we can do the impossible when God is in it, when God is in us. In Jesus’ name, Amen.

I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Repub-lic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f

Justification 
The existing Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse, constructed in 1979, does not meet 
the United States Courts Design Guide standards and lacks adequate security to meet the 
standards for Facility Security Leve14 as defined by the Interagency Security Committee. 
The existing building ~onfiguration does not allow for distinct separation between 
restricted, secured, and public areas. There are also significant infrastructure issues, 
including ongoing water intmsion that allows water to enter tenant spaces, and failing 
stonn drains and flashing systems. 
The new courthouse will meet the long-term needs of the courts and provide separate circulation for the public, judges, 
and prisoners, thereby improving security and the 
efficiency of court operations.

GSA plaris to transfer the existing Fort Lauderdale Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse 
out of the federally owned inventory upon or soon after occupancy of the new 
courthouse. GSA intends to proceed with established disposal processes to transfer the property, since renovation 
and backfill by the Government is not cost-effective. Agencies currently located in the existing building 
that are n9t planned to move into the 
new courthouse will be relocated to commercial leased space in the surrounding area.

Services Administration (GSA) proposes design and construction of a new 
U,S. Courthouse of approximately 123,100 gross square feet, including 26 parking 
spaces~ in Huntsville, AL. The site for the new courthouse is envisioned to be provided to 
GSA via a donation from the City of Huntsville. The courthouse will meet the 1 0-year 
space needs of the Court arid'' court-related agencies and the site can accommodate the anticipated 
30-year needs of the Court. Part I of the Federal Judiciary's Courthouse 
Project Priorities list (approved by the Judicial Conference of the United States on 
September 12, 20! 7} includes a courthouse project in Huntsville, AL.

Overview of Project 
The courts and related agencies currently occupy space in the U.S. Courthouse and Post 
Office in Huntsville, AL, and leased space in Decatur, AL. The new courthouse will 
provide five courtrooms and six chambers consistef!t with the application of courtroom sharing policies and the provision 
of not providing space for projected judgeships. One

in Huntsville. The Bankruptcy Court will vacate the leased location in Decatur and move to the new courthouse 
to co-locate with the District Court in the new building. 
1 The FY 2018 Public Law included $110,000,000 for courthouse construction in Huntsville, AL, as 
requested by the Judiciary in the CPP which was based on site acquisition, new construction, and 
renovation of the existing fncillty~ Due !o cha.11ges in l~e progra.rn since ·that time, the project being 
proposed is for construction of a new courthouse at an estimated total project cost of $86,4632000. GSA

Justice-Marshals Service, trial preparation space for the Federal Public Defender and the 
U.S. Department of Justice--Office of the U.S Attorney, and GSA. 
Justification 
The existing Huntsville Post Office and U.S. Courthouse, constructed in 1936, does not meet the United 
States Courts Design Guide Standards and lacks adequate security as defined in the Interagency 
Security Committee Facility Security Level 4. TI1e existing building configuration does not allow for distinct separation between restricted, secured and public areas. The site to be donated 
by the City of Huntsville is located at the northwest comer of 
Gallatin Street and LoweAvenue. Federal.development on this site offers compatibility with the city's Master 
Plan. The new courthouse will allow for co-location of court operations, separate circulation for the public, judges, and prisoners, thereby improving security as well as efficiency 
of court operations. Relocation of agencies from leased space in Decatur into the new courthouse in Huntsville will avoid approximately 
$508,000 per year in private sector lease costs. 
Design Guide Exception 
There are no exceptions to the U.S. Courts Design Guide.

This project will be designed to conform to requirements of the Facilities Standards for 
the Public Buildings Service. GSA encourages design opportunities to increase energy and water efficiency above the 
minimum performance criteria. 
Future of Existing Federal Building 
GSA plans to reuse the existing Huntsville Post Office and U.S. Courthouse to house agencies 
cun·ently located in leased space in the surrounding area. The tenant mix is 
pending confirmation of agency program requirements to determine the best housing 
solution.. GSA plans to utilize funds remaining from the courthouse appropriation to renovate and backfill the existing building as was originally envisioned. 
The remaining funds total 
$23,537,000. A prospectus requesting approval for the anticipated renovation project will be submitted 
at a future date along with a request to transfer the necessary funds from new construction to repair and alteration.

The General Services Administration (GSA) proposes a repair and alteration project to address seismic deficiencies; undertake targeted building systems modernizations; 
a11d 
reconfigure, alter, and backfill vacant space at the Frank E. Moss U.S. Courthouse (Moss Comihouse) located 
at 350 So'uth Main Street in Salt Lake City, Utah. GSA's Seismic Rating 
System Report, released on March 31, 2016, lists the Moss Comihouse as having one 
of the highest seismic 1isk ratings in the GSA portfolio. Once renovated, relocation 
of agencies cunently in leased space into the Moss Courthotise will provide an annual lease cost avoidance 
of approximately $4,400,000 and an annual agency rent savings of 
approximately $2,400,000. 
Project Background 
As part of its Fiscal Year (FY) 2014 Capital Investment and Leasing Program, GSA 
requested $15,000,000 for the reconfiguration and alteration of existing space at the Moss Comihouse. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 
2014 (Public Law 113-7 6), appropriated a lump sum 
of $593,288,000 for Major Repairs and Alterations and, as pmi 
of GSA's FY 2014 Major ·Repairs .and Alterations Expenditure Plan, GSA allocated 
$15,000,000 for the Moss Courthouse project. Upon re-evaluation of the building's repair and alteration needs, including the identification 
of significant seismic deficiencies, 
GSA, in collaboration with plam1ed backfill tenants, decided to halt the FY 2014 project. This 
pmspectus request reflects and is seeking approval of a more comprehensive project scope. The appropriation needed in support 
of this request has been reduced by the balance 
of funds remaining from the FY 2014 allocation.

Building 
The Moss Courthouse is located in the Exchange Place Historic District of downtown Salt Lake City, Utah. 01iginally constructed in three distinct phases in 1905, 1912, and 1932, the building served 
as a United States Post Office and Comihouse and contains 229,807 gross square feet. The building has five stories above grade, with an elevator/mechanical penthouse and full basement below grade. The building is listed in the National Register 
of Historic Places as a contributing building and as the oldest structure 
in. the Exchange Place Historic District. In 2014, the new U.S. Courthouse 
Almex was completed next to the Moss Courthouse, and the two buildings became physically connected through underground access hmnels, a shared loading dock, and a shared 
chilling system.

Proposed Project 
The proposed project will address seismic deficiencies by utilizing shear walls and seismic bracing. 
The project will address structural deficiencies; upgrade mechanical systems; provide new and repaired floor, wall, and ceiling finishes 
in areas impacted by 
seismic retrofits; replace fixtures and improve access to comply with Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standards (ABBAS); upgrade plumbing; provide a 
new boiler; upgrade the HVAC system; upgrade elevators; and complete fire and life safety upgrades. Backfill 
of vacant space provides a long-tenn housing solution for vmious tenants in the historic Central Business District (CBD) 
of Salt Lake City and generates lease cost avoidance. Alterations will 
be completed while the building is vacant.

Investment in the Moss Courthouse is needed to keep this historic buildingin the Federal inventory, comply with Executive 
Order 13 717 (Establishing a Federal Earthquake Risk 
Management Standard), and protect building occupants and visitors by meeting current safety codes. GSA's Seismic Rating System Report, released on March 31, 
2016, lists the Moss 
Comihouse as having one of the highest seismic risk ratings in the GSA portfolio. The Moss Comihouse was determined to be a long-term seismic risk that requires a seismic mitigation plan to reduce the risk. To address this risk and comply with Executive 
Order 
13717, this project adopts the Standards of Seismic Safety for Existing Federally Owned 
and Leased Buildings to meet the minimum level acceptable for managing earthquake 1isk. 
W11el1 the U.S. District Court relocated to the new U.S. Courthouse Am1ex, it vacated 
approxin1ately 91,000 usable square feet (USF) of the building's 151,000 USF. This project provides for the backfill 
of the vacant space with agencies located in leased space. GSA cunently leases more than 
half a million USF in the Salt Lake City market. The Moss Courthouse is a desirable location near the light rail and CBD amenities, and provides a level 
of secmity that customer agencies require.

The last significant capital investment in the Moss Courthouse was over 24 years ago. The building systems have reached or exceeded their expected useful lives 
and are. becoming more costly 
to repair. This project continues to leverage co-location of the two buildings 
by replacing the Moss· Courthouse boiler, which is at the end of its useful life, with a new boiler to be located in the new 
U.S. Courthouse ArU1ex in mechanical space specifically designed 
to accommodate a new boiler for the Moss Courthouse. CulTent building occupants will be housed in temporary swing space outside 
of the building while construction occurs. The project will be completed while the building is empty to reduce risk, lessen the estimated construction timeline, and decrease estimated consttuction costs. 
Summary of Energy Compliance 
This project will be designed to confonn to requirements of the Facilities Standards for 
the Public Buildings Service. GSA encourages design opportunities to increase energy and 
water efficiency above the minimum performance criteria. 
Prior Appropriations 
GSA received lump-sum funding in FY 2014 for Major Repairs and Alterations and allocated 
$15,000,000 for a Moss Comihouse project, as described in greater detail in the Project Background section 
of this prospectus. A portion of the FY 2014 funds were expended 
on project development, but the remaining $13,247,000 will be applied to this 
newly scoped project. ·

The existing building ~onfiguration does not allow for 'distinct separation between 
restricted, secured, and public areas. There are also significant infrastructure issues, 
including ongoing water intrusion that allows water to enter tenant spaces, and failing 
storm drains and flashing systems. 
The new courthouse will meet the long-term needs of the courts and provide separate circulation for the

A new 99,986 NUSF lease in San Diego will replace the existing 43,473 NUSF Mission VaHey Clinic. The current space in this facility is insufficient to meet 
VA's needs. The new lease will allow 
VA to expand its current primary care, mental health, specialty care, and ancillary services 
to veterans in a right-sized, state-of-the-art, energy-efficient healthcare facility. Resolutions 
of Approval 
Resolutions adopted by the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, and the 
Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works approving this prospectus will constitute approval to make appropriations 
to lease space in a facility that will yield the required net usable area. 
Interim Leasing 
TI1e Government will execute such interim leasing actions as are necessary to ensure continued housing prior to the effective date 
of the new lease. It is in the best interest of 
the Government to avert the financial risk of holdover tenancy. 
1 This estimate is for fiscal year 2018 nnd may be escalated by 2.0 percent annually to the effective date of the lease to 
account for inflation. Titc propos(:d rental rate is unserviced and excludes all operating expenses, real estate taxes, 
insurnncc, und management and maintenance reserve costs, whether paid by the lessor or directly by the Government. 
1 New leases may contain an escalation clause to provide for annual changes in real estate taxes and opcrnting costs.

-HUNTSVI~LE, AL PBS 
Prospectus Number: PAL-CTC-'HU18 
Congressional District: 5 The General 
Services Administration (GSA) proposes design and construction of a new 
U.S. Courthouse of approximately 123,100 gross square feet, including 26 parking 
spaces~ in Huntsville, AL. The site for the new courthouse is envisioned to be provided to 
GSA via a donation from the City of Huntsville. The courthouse will meet the 1 0-year 
space needs of the Court and court-related agencies and the site can accommodate the 
anticipated 30-year needs of the Court. Part I of the Federal Judiciary's Courthouse 
Project Priorities list (approved by the Judicial Conference of the United States on 
September 12, 20~ 7} includes a courthouse project in Huntsville, AL.

FY 2018 Funding (PL 115~141, March 23, 2018) 
(Design, Construction, Management & Inspection) ................................. $110,000,0001 
Overview of Project 
The courts and related agencies currently occupy space in the U.S. Courthouse and Post 
Office in Huntsville, AL, and leased space in Decatur, AL. The new courthouse will provide five courtrooms and six chambers 
consisteqt with the application of courtroom sharing policies and the provision 
of not providing space for projected judgeships. One 
District judge will move from Birmingham, AL, upon completion of the new courthouse 
in Huntsville. The Bankmptcy Court will vacate the leased location in Decatur and move 
to the new courthouse to co-locate with the District Court in the new building. 
1 The FY 2018 Public Law included $110,000,000 for courthouse construction in Huntsville, AL, as 
requested by the Judiciary in the CPP which was based on site acquisition, new constlllction, and 
renovation of the existing facility! Due to cha..11ges in the prognLf!l since ·that time, the project being 
proposed is for construction of a new courthouse at an estimated total project cost of $86,4631000. GSA 
plans to utilize funds remaining from the courthouse appropriation to renovate and backfili the existing building. 
GSA will make a future request for prospectus approval for renovation of the existing building and a future 
transfer request from new construction to repair and alteration.

U.S. District Court, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, U.S. Probation Office, U.S. Department of 
Justice-Marshals Service, trial preparation space for the Federal Public Defender and the 
U.S. Department of Justice-Office of the U.S Attorney, and GSA. 
Justification The existing Huntsville 
Post Office and U.S. Courthouse, constructed in 1936, does not meet the 
United States Courts Design Guide Standards and lacks adequate security as defined in the Interagency Security Committee 
Facility Security Level 4. The existing building configuration does not allow for distinct separation between restricted, secured and public areas. The site to 
be donated by the City of Huntsville is located at the northwest comer of 
Gallatin Street and Lowe Avenue. Federa1.development on this site offers compatibility with the city's Master 
Plan. The new courthouse will allow for co-location of court operations, separate circulation for the public, judges, and prisoners, thereby improving security as well 
as efficiency of court operations. Relocation of agencies from leased space in Decatur into the new courthouse in Huntsville will avoid approximately 
$508,000 per year in private sector lease costs. Design Guide Exception There are no exceptions to the 
U.S. Courts Design Guide.

FY 2019 Project Summary PBS PUT-0017~SL19 · 
2 
The General Services Administration (GSA) proposes a repair and alteration project to 
address seismic deficiencies; undertake targeted building systems modernizations; ai1d 
reconfigure, alter, and backfill vacant space at the Frank E. Moss U. S. Courthouse (Moss Courthouse) located 
at 350 So'uth Main Street in Salt Lake City, Utah. GSA's Seismic Rating System Report, 
released on March 31, 2016, lists the Moss Courthouse as having one 
of the highest seismic risk ratings in the GSA portfolio. Once renovated, relocation 
of agencies cunently in leased space into the Moss Courthouse will provide an annual lease cost avoidance 
of approximately $4,400,000 and an annual agency rent savings of 
approximately $2,400,000, 
Project Background 
As part of its Fiscal Year (FY) 2014 Capital Investment and Leasing Program, GSA 
requested $15,000,000 for the reconfiguration and alteration of existing space at the Moss Courthouse. The 
· Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 (Public Law 113-76), appropriated a 
lun1p sum of $593,288,000 for Major Repairs and Alterations and, as part 
of GSA's FY 2014 Major ·Repairs and Alterations Expenditure Plan, GSA allocated 
$15,000,000 for the Moss Courthouse project. Upon re-evaluation of the building's repair and alteration needs, including the identification 
of significant seismic deficiencies, 
GSA, in collaboration with plam1cd backfill tenants; decided to halt the FY 2014 project. This prospectus request reflects and 
is seeking approval of a more comprehensive project scope. The appropriation needed in 
suppmi of this request has been reduced by the balance 
of funds remaining from the FY 2014 allocation. ' 
FY 2019 Committee Approval Requested (Design, Construction, Management 
& Inspection) ................................... $116,893,000 
FY 2019 Appropriation Requested (Design, Construction, Management 
& Inspecti~n) ................................. $103,646,0001 
1 A portion of the FY 2014 funds was expended on project development prior to the cessation of the project The 
$13,247,000 remaining will be used for this project, thereby lowering the overall appropriation request in this prospectus.

The Moss Comihouse is located in the Exchange Place Historic District of downtown 
Salt Lake City, Utah. 01iginally constructed in three distinct phases in 1905, 1912, and 1932, the building served as a 
United States Post Office and Courthouse and contains 229,807 gross square feet. The building has five stmies above grade, with an elevator/mechanical penthouse and 
full basement below grade. The building is listed in 
the National Register of Histmic Places as a contributing building and as the oldest structure 
in the Exchange Place Historic District. In 2014, the new U.S. Courthouse 
Almex was completed next to the Moss Courthouse, and the two buildings became physically connected through underground access tum1els, a shared loading dock, and a shared 
c.h:illing system.

Investment in the Moss Courthouse is needed to keep this historic buildingin the Federal 
inventory, comply with Executive Order 13717 (Establishing a Federal Earthquake Risk Management Standard), and protect building occupants and visitors 
by meeting current safety codes. GSA's Seismic Rating System Report, released on March 31, 2016, lists the 
Moss 
Courthouse as having one of the highest seismic 1isk ratings in the GSA portfolio. The Moss Comihouse was determined to be a 
long-term seismic 1isk that requires a seismic mitigation plan 
to reduce the risk. To address this 1isk and comply with Executive Order 
13717, this project adopts the Standards of Seismic Safety for Existing Federally Owned 
and Leased Buildings to meet the minimum level acceptable for managing earthquake 
risk. 
Whe11 the U.S. District Comi relocated to the new U.S. Courthouse Am1ex, it vacated approximately 
91,000 usable square feet (USF) of the building's 151,000 USF. This project provides for the backfill 
of the vacant space with agencies located in leased space. 
GSA cuuently leases more than half a million USF in the Salt Lake City market. The Moss Comihouse is a desirable location near the light rail and CBD amenities, and provides a level 
of security that customer agencies require.

The last significant capital investment in the Moss Courthouse was ovet 24 years ago. The building systems have reached or exceeded their expected useful lives 
and are becoming more costly 
to repair. This proj cct continues to leverage co-location of the two buildings 
by replacing the Moss· Comihouse boiler, which is at the end of its useful life, with a new boiler 
to be located in the new U.S. Courthouse Annex in mechanical space specifically designed 
to accommodate a new boiler for the Moss Courthouse. Current building occupants will be housed in temporary swing space outside 
of the building 
while construction occurs. The project will be completed while the building is empty to reduce risk, lessen the estimated construction timeline, and decrease estimated construction costs. 
Summary of Energy Compliance 
Tllis projectwill be designed to conform to requirements of the Facilities Standards for the Public Buildings Service. 
GSA encourages design opportunities to increase energy and 
watet efficiency above the minimum performance criteria. 
Prior Appropriations 
GSA received lump-sum funding in FY 2014 for Major Repairs and Alterations· and allocated 
$15,000,000 for a Moss Courthouse project, as described in greater detail in the 
Project Background section of this prospectus. A portion of the FY 2014 funds were expended on project development, but the remaining 
$13,247,000 will be applied to this newly scoped project.

In times of routine and humble duties, may they remember they are serving you. Lord, as we all trust in Your mercies, surround our Nation with the shield of Your favor and protection.

TRIBUTE TO LAMAR ALEXANDER Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, I would like to say a few words following today’s announcement from our dear friend, the senior Senator from Ten-nessee. The great State of Tennessee has been generous to the U.S. Senate over the years. A number of the State’s Sen-ators from both parties have enriched this institution through especially dis-tinguished service and built reputa-tions as national leaders. Nobody embodies this legacy more fully than LAMAR ALEXANDER . While I am sure he will accomplish even more over the next 2 years, L
AMAR is already one of the most consequential Senators on domestic policy in memory. L
AMAR  was a success long before he became a Senator. He had already been a popular and accomplished Governor and a bril-liant Secretary of Education, but for-tunately for this body and for our Na-tion, 16 years ago the Volunteer State saw fit to continue that career of excel-lence by sending L
AMAR here. He has chaired the Republican con-ference. He has chaired the HELP Com-mittee. For his colleagues in both par-ties he is a go-to expert on some of the most critical subjects that directly im-pact Americans’ lives, particularly American families, healthcare, and our children’s schools. The Every Student Succeeds Act and this year’s landmark opioids legisla-tion are two perfect examples of signa-ture L
AMAR ALEXANDER accomplish-ments. They tackle challenging issues in a thoughtful and substantive way. They tangibly improve Americans’ lives, and they passed both Houses of Congress with big bipartisan majori-ties. So the Senate will be lesser without L
AMAR ’s wisdom, collegiality, and ex-pertise when he retires. I am glad that day is 2 years away and grateful we will keep benefiting from his leader-ship through the 116th Congress.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES7628 December 17, 2018 
spoken about the Senate’s agenda for the remainder of the 115th Congress. As was the case at this time last week, there are important items that have yet to be addressed, but thanks to the bipartisan progress made last week, we are significantly closer to the finish line. Together, guided by Chairman B
LUNT  and Senator K
LOBUCHAR , the Senate met the need to revise how Congress handles claims of sexual harassment, workplace discrimination, and other workplace violations. Under the leadership of Chairman R
OBERTS and Senator S TABENOW , we cleared the conference report for the 2018 farm bill, sending my industrial hemp legislation and other critical pro-visions for America’s farming commu-nities to the President’s desk to be-come law. To cap off a year of historic progress on judicial nominations, the Senate voted to confirm the 30th Federal cir-cuit judge of this Congress and this ad-ministration. Now we will turn our attention to the remaining priorities in completing the American people’s business. Last week, I announced that at the request of the President and following improvements that were secured by several Members, the Senate will take up criminal jus-tice legislation here on the floor. Later this afternoon, we will vote on advanc-ing that legislation. I know the proponents of this bill spent a great deal of time and energy drafting their proposal. At the same time, there are a number of Members with outstanding concerns they feel are still unresolved. So if cloture is in-voked later today, the Senate will be considering amendments before we vote on final passage later this week. Of course, the most high-profile items still before us are border security and government funding. We need to make a substantial investment in the integrity of our border and in the safe-ty of American families. We need to close out the year’s appropriations process and reach a bipartisan agree-ment to supply the 25 percent of the Federal Government for which we haven’t already passed funding legisla-tion. I hope the same bipartisan, col-laborative spirit that has carried us this far will enable the Senate and the House to complete this business with-out undue delay.

FARM BILL Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to applaud my colleagues for coming together in a bipartisan fashion to pass the farm bill conference report. There is much to be excited about in the final version of this 5-year reau-thorization. First and foremost, the farm bill will bring much needed cer-tainty and predictability to farmers and ranchers over the next 5 years. This is especially important given the intense pressure our agriculture pro-ducers are facing. If you look at the numbers across the Nation, net farm income is approxi-mately half of what it was when we passed the last farm bill. Farm bank-ruptcies are up by 39 percent since 2014; financing has become more expensive; commodity prices have plummeted; input costs are rising; and the trade outlook is volatile and uncertain, to say the least. Farmers across the country—regard-less of where they call home or which crops they grow—are hurting. The farm bill that Congress approved last week, delivers meaningful and real relief for our farmers and ranchers in these very difficult times. It is the big bill for my home State of Arkansas as well as across the country. Agriculture is a driving force of the Natural State’s economy, adding around $16 billion to our economy every year and accounting for approxi-mately one in every six jobs. That is why agriculture advocacy groups in Ar-kansas were very excited when we passed the final version. The Arkansas Farm Bureau said it was ‘‘pleased that Congress has recog-nized how important the new farm bill is to the hard-working farmers and ranchers of this country’’ and ex-pressed gratitude that we came to-gether ‘‘to pass this critical legislation before the new year.’’ The Agricultural Council of Arkansas said it ‘‘cannot stress enough the im-portance of the farm bill and the need for it among Arkansas farmers.’’ The council went on to add ‘‘a farm bill with meaningful support is critical in preventing significant harm to Arkan-sas farms.’’ The Arkansas Rice Federation said the farm bill will provide ‘‘certainty in such a variable agricultural climate.’’ Along with strengthening key risk management tools for our farmers, the farm bill also helps our rural commu-nities by authorizing key economic de-velopment and job creation programs. It helps rural Arkansans with every-thing from combating the opioid crisis, to home financing, to high-speed inter-net access. Sending this bill to the President is about as important as it gets for my State. It would not have been as bene-ficial to Arkansas farmers and ranch-ers without the diligent efforts of the conference committee leadership who worked to ensure that the harmful, ar-bitrary policy changes were excluded from the final conference report. As a result of these efforts, family farms are protected from additional regulations and unnecessary paperwork. I commend Chairmen R
OBERTS and C
ONWAY , as well as Ranking Members S
TABENOW and P ETERSON , for their commitment to make this bill fair and equitable to the diverse needs of pro-ducers across all regions of the coun-try. Again, as always, special thanks to the staffs who do so much hard work around here to get these things done. It was a heavy lift. They worked hard to ensure that we would get this done be-fore adjourning this Congress. I would also like to thank them for their willingness to include provisions that I advocated for in the conference report. The elimination of all State performance bonuses in SNAP is some-thing I pushed for in the last farm bill. I am pleased that this time we got it included. The Federal Government partners with States to administer SNAP, but in order to best serve pro-gram recipients, the States must be good partners. Unfortunately, States have exaggerated their performance to receive these bonuses. This policy change saves $48 million per year. Is a smart reform that we have made in this bill. I was particularly proud that another provision, championed by my friend Senator H
EITKAMP and by me, was in-cluded. It would allow trade promotion funding for agricultural products to be used in Cuba. This is a big win for our farmers and ranchers who have consist-ently been working to open up more ac-cess to the Cuban market. Cuba imports approximately 80 per-cent of its food, and our farmers and ranchers produce the highest quality, lowest cost, and safest food in the world. Additionally, I welcomed the inclu-sion of my provision that clarifies the definition of livestock to include live fish for purposes of the Department of Transportation’s hours of service regu-lations, as well as reauthorization of the ATTRA Program, which does so much to help our veterans who want to get started in agriculture, and reau-thorization of the Delta Regional Au-thority. The farm bill conference report in-cludes a true investment in conserva-tion to help the waterfowl in Arkansas, and I was excited to see the Century Farms Act that Senator M
URPHY and I authored was also a part of the pack-age. With approval of the conference re-port last week, we are just one step away from the farm bill becoming law. President Trump has indicated his sup-port of a farm bill that will ensure cer-tainty and predictability for producers. We are sending one his way, and I look forward to it becoming law. With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Will the Senator suspend a moment? f

TRIBUTE TO LYNN JENKINS  
Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I am on the floor this afternoon to honor a friend, a colleague, and the senior Rep-resentative from Kansas, Congress-woman L
YNN JENKINS , who has grace-fully and honorably served Kansas for two decades in both our State and here in the Federal Government. While I am going to talk a little bit about L
YNN’s history and past, none of this should be taken just as something that is being read in her honor. She is a very special person who has served Kansas so well, and she brings such tre-mendous attributes to public service. We will miss her greatly, and Kansans will have benefited from her service, but she will also remain a role model for many who look for ways to make America and to make our State more prosperous, with a brighter future.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES7640 December 17, 2018 
Congresswoman J ENKINS grew up on a farm outside of Holton, KS—a small town just about 100 miles away from Kansas City, just north of Topeka, where she learned the value of hard work and perseverance. You cannot meet somebody who grew up working on a dairy farm without determining that they have those attributes, and L
YNNhas exemplified that in every en-deavor. She was taught that what needed to be done was something she would do. When you do it, you do it right, and every day you need to step up and do your job to make certain things get done. That is a dairy farmer, and that is L
YNN JENKINS as a Member of the U.S. Congress. Before becoming a Member of Con-gress and before being elected in Kan-sas, L
YNNwas a CPA—a certified public accountant. She recognized a real need for financial reform as a result of that experience, and she used her skills as a CPA to benefit Kansas. In 2003, L
YNN was elected the 37th Kansas State treasurer. L
YNN then took that same tax and financial expe-rience to Washington, DC, where she was elected the Congresswoman from the Second District of our State. After her election to the U.S. House of Representatives, L
YNN quickly rose to become one of the highest ranking Members of Congress, serving today as the vice chair of the House Republican caucus; she served in that capacity for 4 years. She is a senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee. It goes without saying that in addi-tion to her background as a CPA, her intellect, and her service-oriented mindset, L
YNN is one of the most be-loved Kansans we have. We meet with many of the same groups here in Kan-sas and in Washington, DC, and I know that visiting with L
YNN is, without a doubt, one of the highlights for Kan-sans who come to Washington, DC. L
YNN also understands that while it may seem that this environment is a loud and boisterous one and that mak-ing your appearances on national TV is an effective way of serving as a Mem-ber of Congress, she knows you can really serve your country, and espe-cially Kansas, by rolling up your sleeves and just getting to work. It has been a privilege to witness this first-hand and to work on a number of issues with L
YNNover the years. Together we jointly introduced the fair tax legisla-tion, we worked together to protect rural healthcare in Kansas, we made certain our veterans received the bene-fits they deserve, and we are both chairs of our respective Hunger Cau-cuses. We are both lucky to have Bob Dole as a mentor, and we have made it a priority to carry on his legacy to end hunger in America and around the globe. L
YNN was also a champion of the Mental Health First Aid Act, modern-izing section 529 college savings plans, and was an integral part of passing major tax legislation for the first time in 30 years. LYNNand I often have shared flights back and forth from Kansas to Wash-ington, DC. She has, like I have, chosen to remain at home in Kansas, and we are often on the same airplane. I could always count on L
YNNto have the con-versation of what was going on in the House and for her to explain to me what should be going on in the Senate that wasn’t. We were able to take care of our constituents’ business by being together on that flight to Washington, DC, and on the flight home. It also goes without saying that L
YNNwill be sorely missed as a leader and as a sensible voice in Congress and in our Kansas delegation. Her role will be so difficult to fill, but I know she is excited about spending more time with her kids, Haley and Hayden, in that place we so proudly call home, the State of Kansas. L
YNN, I thank you for your many years of service and, on behalf of all Kansans, I want you to know we appre-ciate, respect, and admire you. L
YNN, thank you for your friendship, advice, and your realness. I wish you the best of luck and countless M&Ms in your retirement from Congress, and in everything that comes next, may you have success and may you have joy. Please know you will be missed, and we look forward to spending time together as you tell me, still, what I should be doing in the U.S. Senate. 
TRIBUTE TO KEVIN YODER  
Madam President, I want to speak this afternoon about another retire-ment from Kansas, Congressman K
EVIN Y
ODER , who has served the Third Con-gressional District of Kansas for four terms. He is a solid colleague and a good friend. I met K
EVIN when he was an intern in our office when I was a Member of the House of Representatives. I remember his tenacity, his spirit, and his passion for serving Kansans, which he contin-ued to feel long after he was an intern in the Moran world. K
EVIN went on to serve his fellow stu-dents as student body president at the University of Kansas. He earned a law degree from the University of Kansas School of Law. He then served the Overland Park community in the State House of Representatives, and he be-came chairman of the House Appro-priations Committee. As a Member of the U.S. House of Representatives, K
EVIN also served as a member of the Appropriations Com-mittee, and there he was, and has been, a steward of Kansas taxpayers’ hard- earned dollars. As a member of the Appropriations Committee, K
EVIN has made bio-medical funding a top priority. I have enjoyed working with him as we advo-cated for the National Institutes of Health and for the University of Kan-sas Cancer Center, which was des-ignated as a National Cancer Institute in 2012. K
EVIN served as a real leader in Congress in advocating for that des-ignation, and it is a point of pride for our State and the hope of many in our region. He also serves as chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security, where he has worked to help protect our borders and our homeland. KEVIN has been a steady leader in his support for Head Start, understanding that education uniquely unlocks oppor-tunity, and he has worked to give un-derprivileged children a path to success at an early age—an opportunity they unlikely would have otherwise. Understanding the complex and out-dated nature of our country’s immigra-tion laws, K
EVIN has championed legis-lation that could garner the support of both Republicans and Democrats that would end per-country caps on employ-ment-based green cards, clearing the backlog of Indian and Chinese immi-grant green card applications, some of which have been, unfortunately, sitting around untouched on a wait list for decades. K
EVIN also grew up in a small town in Kansas and was a farm kid, and he also learned the value of hard work and the issue of being responsible for the con-sequences of what you do. K
EVIN will be greatly missed in our Kansas delega-tion and here in Washington, DC, and his shoes will be hard to fill. K
EVIN, I hope you are able to spend some well-deserved time with Brook and your girls. I will miss our flights back and forth between Kansas in which you were showing me photos on almost every trip of your children. I wish the very best for K
EVIN, for Brook, his wife, and his daughters as they enter this new chapter. I also pay special tribute to Brook Yoder for her work side-by-side with her husband. They, together as a team, made a tremendous difference in Kan-sas and in Washington, DC. So on behalf of all Kansans, K
EVIN, I say thank you for your dedicated serv-ice to our State. Godspeed. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. E
RNST ). The majority whip. 
CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM  
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, at 5:30, we will be voting on the first pro-cedural step to take up criminal jus-tice reform legislation that started back in 2013 when I introduced a bill we called Federal prison reform. This leg-islation is based on prison reform, but it has taken on some additional at-tributes relative to how we sentence and how judges sentence people con-victed of various crimes. Let me explain a little bit about why this should be a priority for the Senate and for the Congress and for the coun-try. We know the cycle of crime is all too common. People commit crimes. They serve time in prison. They get out of prison. They commit another crime. They serve time again in prison. They are released. A few years ago, this is what one young man in Houston said when he was talking about his own experience: He called himself a ‘‘frequent flyer’’— somebody caught in that revolving door of prison and crime.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S7641 December 17, 2018 
In Texas, in 2007, or thereabouts, we had some farsighted visionary leaders, actually, who decided instead of just being tough on crime, which Texas has always had a reputation for, we needed to be smart on crime too. A little more than a decade ago, Texas prisons were bursting at the seams. We had more people incarcerated in Texas prisons than any State in the Nation, and trag-ically we also had high recidivism rates. So it was obvious we were doing something wrong, and we needed to up our game. The Legislative Budget Board in our State estimated that in the next 5 years, Texas would need as many as 17,000 new prison beds to house the growing inmate population. So two op-tions became clear: build more costly prisons with the same tragic results or fix the system, and we chose the latter. I would say, some of our colleagues and some of the critics of the under-lying bill say: Well, the best way to keep communities safe is to keep criminals in prison. There are some people, sadly, who will never take ad-vantage of the opportunity to trans-form their lives through faith-based programs, deal with their drug and al-cohol addiction, learn a skill, get a GED; in other words, there are some people, unfortunately, we can’t save, but there are others who understand they have made a mistake and paid their debt to society and want to turn their lives around. Those are the type of people this criminal justice reform bill speaks to. In the beginning in my State, the de-cision was largely driven by cost. The estimated pricetag to build new prisons exceeded $2 billion. You can imagine what that does to a State’s budget, but instead of leaving taxpayers with the bill and just moving on, a visionary group of State legislators decided to dive further into the problem to try to understand it better and propose cost- effective ways to fix it. These fixes came in a number of forms which, look-ing back on it now, seem pretty obvi-ous, pretty intuitive but, at the time, really was revolutionary. First were improvements in our pa-role system, which means that once people got out of prison, people were then supervised while out of prison to make sure they met the conditions of their parole. They didn’t get involved with the same bad company that helped them get in trouble in the first place, and they didn’t start using drugs again, and they kept fully employed. So this parole supervision targeted 10 percent fewer revocations and grad-uated sanctions for small rules viola-tions such as missed meetings. That is particularly important because one of the first indications that somebody who is on parole is in trouble is when they don’t show up for their meeting with their parole officer. In the past, that was just pretty much blown off until those missed meetings began to accumulate, and then, ultimately, that individual found themselves arrested, back in jail, and ultimately back in prison. So rather than letting these small infractions pile up, eventually sending the person back to prison, each misstep was dealt with swiftly and surely. In 2005, $55 million was appropriated to Texas probation departments to make improvements in how we super-vise people who had once been in pris-on, with most of the funds going to-ward reducing caseloads. In other words, parole officers, probation offi-cers, if they have to handle so many cases, they can’t give them the indi-vidual attention they need and that the formerly incarcerated individual will benefit from. That brought the number of cases down from nearly 150 in some areas to 110 probationers per officer. This allowed for closer super-vision and constant application of sanctions when called for. The results were pretty dramatic. In 2005, our State was paroling 21,000 pris-oners, 11,000 of whom returned to pris-on after committing other crimes. So that means a little more than 50 per-cent were eventually going back to prison. A decade later, putting in place these reforms, the State paroled 28,000 prisoners, and about 4,500 came back— or only 16 percent. So we went from about half of the people in prison being paroled without much supervision and much help to only 16 percent because of these reforms. These reforms, as I said at the out-set, may not look so obvious—and it seems so intuitive that it seems clear to us today—but at the time, it was pretty groundbreaking. As we all know, for many politicians, one of their biggest fears when it comes to their next election is being accused of being soft on crime, but, again, this is not about being tough on crime or soft on crime, this is about being smart on crime and getting the best results. The decline in revocations led to the savings of $119 million for Texas tax-payers—more than double the initial investment in these programs. Second were improvements to prison alternatives for low-level, nonviolent offenders. Judges and prosecutors and corrections officials were frustrated by the number of these individuals who kept ending up right back where they started, with no real change in their trajectory and certainly no more hope for their future. So the State started to provide funding to increase access to things like substance abuse treatment, drug courts, and mental illness treat-ment. Again, the reason why people end up in prison often has very little to do with their desire to live a life of crime; many of them feed their addiction by theft and other crimes. People who are mentally ill who go to jail or prison, without a diagnosis in treatment, don’t get any better, and when they get let out of jail and prison, they just go back deteriorating until they become a dan-ger to themselves and others. In addition, mandatory prerelease programs were expanded to reduce the backlog of inmates waiting to com-plete these requirements. In other words, there were a lot more people who wanted to go through these pro-grams because they recognized the ben-efit to themselves and their families, but they just simply couldn’t get into the programs because there weren’t enough slots. For example, the expansion of a drug treatment plan brought down wait time from 1 year to 4 months. If you are somebody with a drug problem, and you are told: ‘‘We don’t have room for you. Come back in a year,’’ that can be, obviously, discouraging and not re-sult in getting them the help they need. Moving the wait time for drug treat-ment down from 1 year to 4 months moved two-thirds of the waitlist into treatment, after which they were re-leased, only to see a more hopeful and better outcome. In Texas, the model worked. Not only did we avoid building new prisons, we have actually closed eight prisons in Texas. Again, this sounds a little shocking if you are from other parts of the country where you hear about our tough-on-crime reputation, but because of these reforms, we were actually able to close eight prisons because they were no longer needed. We quickly saw a reduction in both incarceration and crime rates by double digits at the same time. To me, this is the essence of criminal justice reform. There are some who say: We need to do criminal justice re-form because, well, we simply imprison too many people. There are others who say: Well, we imprison people for of-fenses that are disproportionate to what they have done. To me, the es-sence of criminal justice reform is re-ducing the crime rate—in other words, increasing and improving public safety. Other States took notice of what was happening and started to do the same. Georgia, Rhode Island, and North Caro-lina quickly followed suit, and we have seen several other States across the United States adopt similar reforms. When I say we saw a reduction in both incarceration and crime rates, let me give a couple of numbers. From 2005 to 2016, Texas’s FBI index crime plummeted by more than 34 per-cent. In the same period, the incarcer-ation rate dropped 23 percent. Those are pretty shocking and surprising numbers. The crime rate went down 34 percent, and the incarcerate rate dropped 23 percent. You would think the opposite would be true—that with incarceration rates going down, the crime rate would go up—but because of these visionary programs and reforms, they simply worked in tandem to both reduce the incarceration rate and im-prove public safety at the same time. It is clear now, based on experience, that these reforms and outcomes are real. I have been working with my col-leagues in the Senate Judiciary Com-mittee since 2013 to try to bring these

reforms now to the national level. The FIRST STEP Act is our opportunity to do just that this week in the Senate. Thanks to the primary sponsors of the FIRST STEP Act—the Senator from Illinois, who has joined us here in the Chamber, the chairman of the Judi-ciary Committee, Senator G

HELDON  W
HITEHOUSE and I worked primarily on the prison reform bill. The current bill has undergone some major improvements over the last few weeks, which I am very proud of. The previous version of this legislation had a number of very positive attributes. In fact, more than three-quarters of the bill was based on the CORRECTIONS Act that Senator W
HITEHOUSE and I in-troduced in 2014, which is the prison re-form component of the legislation. But the remainder—the sentencing ele-ments in the bill—was more controver-sial, and many of my concerns were shared by members of the law enforce-ment community. As I was gauging where Members stood on the bill, it was clear that many could not support the old version of the bill and needed the primary sponsors of the bill—whom I mentioned a moment ago—to work with them to try to make it more acceptable to law enforcement, which was going to send a signal to many other Senators about whether they should get behind the bill. We have all learned how to get things done here in the Senate, and that is not to just point out the problems with legislation but to listen and work to-gether to find solutions, and that is ex-actly what we did. We spent a lot of time talking to national law enforce-ment organizations and those in Texas. I know we all value the input of our sheriffs, police chiefs, and other law enforcement professionals, and we tried to work with them to figure out how we could make this bill stronger. I lis-tened to feedback from our Nation’s police officers and sheriffs, and we all got to work. We had meetings, we ne-gotiated, and we compromised with colleagues on both sides of the aisle, as well as friends across the Capitol in the House. We also worked with the White House, whom we have all stayed in con-stant contact with on this issue since the Trump administration took office nearly 2 years ago. Jared Kushner, the President’s son-in-law, has been relent-less in his pursuit of getting this crimi-nal justice reform bill done, and I know each of us who has been involved in this legislation has talked to him al-most on a daily basis, sometimes many times in a given day. This bill is the product of those nego-tiations and those changes, and I am not the only one who is happy with the result. Since these improvements have been made, the bill has been endorsed by a number of important groups, in-cluding the National Association of Counties, the Texas Municipal Police Association, the Fraternal Order of Po-lice, and the Council of State Govern-ments. I appreciate the dedication and hard work of our colleagues who worked on this to get the bill to where it is today. Before tonight’s cloture vote, I want to correct some misconceptions float-ing around about what this bill will and will not do. There are some who, for example, say that this legislation will put violent criminals and sex offenders back on the streets, which is completely false. Let me say that again because I think it bears repeating. This bill will not allow dangerous, violent criminals to be re-leased early. That is pure fiction. Not everyone is eligible to earn the credits that lead to early release based on their participation in these pro-grams which I talked about a moment ago. This bill specifically lists 48 of-fenses that disqualify offenders from earning time credits, including crimes such as murder, specified assault, carjacking that results in injury or death, and unlawful possession or use of a firearm by violent criminals and drug traffickers. Simply put, we use the most modern social science evaluation tools to find out who is at low risk of reoffending. They are the ones who get the benefit of these programs because we think these are the ones who are most likely to have a good outcome and not end up back in prison. We have disqualified violent offenders, including anybody who either used or displayed or hap-pened to be carrying a firearm during the course of committing their offense. Those who have not committed one of those crimes aren’t automatically eligible. In fact, nobody is automati-cally eligible for the benefits of this program. As I said, they have to be evaluated to be at minimum or low re-cidivism risk. That decision isn’t made by Congress; it is made by the experi-enced law enforcement professionals and wardens in the Federal Bureau of Prisons who work with these men and women every day. It is important that we look at peo-ple who are at low risk of recidivism and low risk to public safety in the community because what we can do is use the resources not to keep people like that behind bars unnecessarily but to focus on the truly violent criminals who are not likely to be rehabilitated because, frankly, they don’t want to be rehabilitated. Focusing on the most dangerous criminals and keeping them behind bars, while providing relief to those who earned that time credit, just makes common sense. Some people are falsely claiming that the FIRST STEP Act will retro-actively release illegal immigrants and top-level drug traffickers by increasing the good time credit by 7 days a year. Again, that is simply not true. All the bill does is clarify Congress’s original intent when it comes to good time credit. Good time credit is different from the earned credit for participating in these various programs. But you can imagine how important this is to the safety of the jailers, wardens, and public law en-forcement officials in the prisons be-cause it gives inmates hope that if they lead exemplary lives while in prison, they have greater hope of earning good time credit and getting out earlier. All this does is clarifies Congress’s original intent that 54 days of good time credit be available rather than the 47 days that the Bureau of Prisons had interpreted under previous law that was more ambiguous. So that is not a change to what Congress in-tended but merely a clarification of preexisting congressional intent. In addition, some of the bill’s detrac-tors are claiming it will allow gang members and high-risk inmates to be transferred to lower security prisons in order to be closer to their homes. This, too, is false. Gang members and high- risk inmates will not be transferred to lower security prisons under this bill. While the bill does call for inmates to be transferred to a prison within 500 miles of their release residence, that only applies if there are no security concerns and is subject to availability of beds and other conditions. For example, a member of the dan-gerous MS–13 gang is held in maximum security over 500 miles from their re-lease residence. There happens to be a minimum-security prison within 500 miles of their release residence. They would not be transferred. We simply don’t transfer violent criminals to me-dium-security prisons because they happen to be within 500 miles of their residence. There has been a lot of mythology, misunderstanding, and misrepresenta-tion of what is in the bill. The goal of this bill is not to release broad swaths of criminals—in fact, it is just the op-posite. This legislation allows prisons to help criminals transform their lives, if they are willing to take the steps and responsibility to do so, so that we are not perpetuating the cycle of crime that continues to plague communities across the country and to drain tax-payer dollars in the process and dam-age public safety. I thank all of our colleagues who have worked so hard on this legisla-tion. I think one of the most important attributes of a legislator—certainly of a Senator—is to listen to our constitu-ents, listen to the feedback from our Members, and help build a better bill that will garner significantly more support than it otherwise would have had. I am confident that the Senate will pass this bill, and we can soon send it to the President’s desk for his signa-ture. Madam President, I yield the floor.

plan to keep the government open. In fact, the only indication he has given is that he wants a government shutdown. At the moment, the situation should be clear to everyone: President Trump does not have the votes for his wall. He certainly doesn’t have the votes in the Senate, and it doesn’t seem he has the votes even in the House, where he needs only Republican votes. Tellingly, the House is on recess until Wednesday night—just 2 days be-fore the Trump shutdown would start. It is because the House leadership has no idea what to do, where the votes are, or where the people are. Many of them don’t want to come back. Every-one knows the situation. Even with a Republican Congress, no threat or tem-per tantrum will get the President his wall. On the other hand, Democrats are all together. We have given a proposal to President Trump. We have given two alternatives to President Trump that could easily pass both the House and the Senate. We could pass the six bi-partisan appropriations bills and a 1- year CR on homeland security, or we could pass a 1-year CR for all of the re-maining Agencies. President Trump should support one of these options and spare innocent, hard-working Ameri-cans the pain of an unnecessary Trump shutdown. His temper tantrum will get him a shutdown but will not get him a wall. It is futile. Unfortunately, since our meeting last Tuesday, Leader P
ELOSI and I have still not heard from the White House whether they will accept either of these two options, nor have we even heard from our Republican colleagues in the Senate or House about what they might support to avoid a shut-down—not a peep. They are nowhere to be found. A reporter told me that Republicans said: What is the Democrats’ plan? We gave them two. The real question is, What is the Republicans’ plan? They don’t have one. They don’t know what to do. In the scuttlebutt, where we talk to one another, Senate Republican leadership has no idea what President Trump wants. Neither does House Re-publican leadership. And they don’t have the courage, the strength, in my judgment, or the wisdom to tell the President he is wrong on this, and let’s move forward. That amazes me more in the House than anywhere else. House Republicans lost 40 seats by just clinging to President Trump even when they knew he was wrong. Are they continuing this pattern of behavior, and are our Senate col-leagues going to do the same? It makes no sense. My friends on the other side of the aisle know the President’s wall is wrong, ineffective, and it cannot pass. The President’s daily Twitter outbursts can’t alter reality. My Republican friends need to step up and convince the President to pick one of the two sensible offers we have made. Right now, nobody seems to know what Republicans want or plan to do. It is shocking that Republicans haven’t engaged yet in this process, considering they control the Presi-dency, the House, and the Senate. What a symbol, what evidence of dis-array. Once again, I remind my Republican colleagues that going along with a Trump shutdown is a futile act. When Democrats take control of the House on January 3, they will pass one of our two options to fund the government, and then leader MCCONNELL and Senate Republicans will be left holding the bag for a Trump shutdown. The onus for reopening the government will wind up on their lap. That is not what they should want. I don’t think they do want it. They are just so fearful of de-parting from President Trump. I re-mind them, when the President wasn’t mixing in, we did two good budget sea-sons. We did two good appropriations bills, which got large majorities of Democrats and Republicans in the House and Senate. You can’t let the President interfere, particularly when he does it in a pound-table, tantrum- like way, without any plan or knowl-edge of how to get things done. If President Trump decides to shut down the government, there is no endgame in which President Trump gets the wall. There is no endgame for Republicans in which they can avoid their share of responsibility—over-whelming share—for a shutdown. The time to solve this problem is now. 
HEALTHCARE  
Madam President, on healthcare, on Friday, in response to a suit brought by Republican attorneys general, a dis-trict court judge in Texas issued a bi-zarre and dreadful ruling that the Af-fordable Care Act was unconstitutional because of changes to the law made by congressional Republicans. If the rul-ing is ultimately upheld, the con-sequences would be disastrous for the American people. It would jeopardize health insurance for more than 20 mil-lion Americans who gained insurance on the exchanges or through expanded Medicaid. It would end protections for the 133 million Americans living with preexisting conditions. Can you imag-ine a mom and dad who have a daugh-ter or a son with cancer, and we now allow the insurance companies to cut them off by not giving them new insur-ance as they watch their child suffer? That is not America. That is not the situation now because of what we all did in 2009 with the ACA. Are our Re-publican colleagues going to let that happen? Americans under the age of 26 could no longer stay on their parents’ health insurance. That has been a sigh of re-lief a breath of fresh air for millions who get out of college and want to get a job but can’t take the job they want because there is not adequate health insurance. It would reopen the prescription drug doughnut hole in Medicare. That would mean that seniors on Medicare—tens of millions—would pay more for prescrip-tion drugs, and essential health bene-fits would be gone. These are not just trivial things. They include guaranteed access to ma-ternity care, free preventive cancer screenings, treatment for opioid addic-tion—crucial things that Americans need that allow them to go away. You can see the extent of the disaster if this court case prevails. Hundreds of millions of Americans would be hurt. Our healthcare system would be thrown into chaos, including for fami-lies who get health insurance from their employer. We Democrats believe the ruling is based on such faulty premises that it will not be upheld by a higher court once it is appealed, but given the po-tential consequences of their ruling, we cannot twiddle our thumbs and hope for the right result. The court, I would remind my col-leagues, based a good portion of its de-cision on what Congress intended. We can clear that up in a minute—in a minute. My friend, Senator MANCHIN , has a resolution which every Democrat in this body has signed onto, to peti-tion the Senate legal counsel to inter-vene in the lawsuit and defend the Af-fordable Care Act on behalf of the Sen-ate because the Trump administration refuses to defend the law and is in favor of it being overturned. President Trump was almost gleeful when this court case came out. Is he going to be gleeful to those parents with cancer, to that college graduate who needs healthcare, to a family who has a father on opioids and needs help? Is he going to be gleeful if they don’t get it? I don’t get him sometimes, much of the time. I hope our Republican colleagues will join us in this petition because if a ma-jority of the House and a majority of the Senate tell the appeals courts our intention was not to overthrow healthcare, it will have a great deal of weight. Some say: Well, let’s do legis-lation. We have all been through that before, with both Democrats and Re-publicans in charge, a very hard, long time—it takes a long time to get healthcare. By the way, the President and a lot of my Republican friends want to cut back on healthcare. That is their goal. They will never come to agreement with us—Democrats in the Senate or the House, which will be democrat-ically controlled in a few weeks—if they stick with that. Legislation is not the best and first way to go; court intervention is. We will be watching. The American people will be watching, particularly so many of my colleagues who said: I am for preexisting conditions. We are going to let them know this idea of ‘‘let’s do legislation’’ will not work. Where are they on the petition? That will determine whether they are hypocrites, saying they want to pro-tect preexisting conditions but not doing the best thing for it or whether they really care about the people who will lose health insurance.

The American people spoke loudly and clearly in the midterms: They want their healthcare protections, and they don’t want Republicans to take them away. I believe Republicans will have no choice but eventually to join us. To not do so would be to jeopardize healthcare for hundreds of millions of Americans and risk a complete disaster for Republicans in future elections. 
TRIBUTE TO LAMAR ALEXANDER  
Madam President, on L AMAR ALEX-
ANDER , my dear friend, we received sad news today—sad for us, happy for him—that our friend, the senior Sen-ator from Tennessee will not be run-ning for reelection in 2020. There will be time to reflect on his life and career at a later date, but upon hearing the news this afternoon, as I was taking the Amtrak down from New York, I felt a pang of sadness. L
AMAR and I have been dear friends, and we worked so hard on many things together. I want to say a few words now. When Senator A
LEXANDER eventually does leave this body, the Senate will lose an incredibly capable legislator and statesman. He cares so much about leg-islating. He reminded me, when I talked to him this afternoon, that he will still be around for 2 years and wants to work together to get things done—an ‘‘Alexanderian’’ statement, if there ever was one. Senator A
LEXANDER has been in the midst of so many things for his 16 years in the Senate, and that is not be-cause he is some ideologue who stood all alone in his own corner and made a lot of speeches and didn’t get things done. No. Senator A
LEXANDER seeks compromise almost reflexively, and he gets things done—the recent higher education bill and legislation dealing with opioids, which he was so pas-sionate about, and he talked to me about it every day for about a month. He gets things done because of his pas-sion, his intelligence as a legislator, and his persistence. Both sides of the aisle respect and trust L
AMAR . I do. We have worked to-gether so many times in my years here, and hopefully, as he said on the phone, there will be a few more opportunities in the next 2 years, his last 2 years in the Senate, to work together success-fully, hopefully, and God willing again. Even though he is not here at the moment, I salute my friend from Ten-nessee and look forward to seeing him in the gym tomorrow morning—we al-ways see each other in the gym—where I can convey these sentiments person-ally. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic whip. Mr. DURBIN. Let me start by joining my colleague, the Democratic leader, in his words about L
AMAR ALEXANDER — a great Senator and a personal friend, someone I am sorry is going to bring his Senate career to an end in 2 years because he has done so many good things. I could spell out many of those things, but one comes to mind imme-diately. A few years ago when I was de-ciding whether to run for reelection myself, I thought one of my goals would be to increase the Federal in-vestment in medical research. That is right in the wheelhouse of the com-mittee jurisdiction of LAMAR ALEX-
ANDER . I went to him and his counter-part on the Democratic side, Senator P
ATTY MURRAY of Washington, and R OY B
LUNT of Missouri, and we put together an informal team pushing for increases in medical research. We have had amazing success. It has been bipar-tisan, and it has been an enthusiastic effort all around. We couldn’t have done it without L
AMAR ’s wholehearted participation. He was committed to medical research, and as a result, we have had more than a 5-percent in-crease each year for the last 4 years in the budget and appropriations for the National Institutes of Health. That is going to end up creating more opportu-nities to spare people suffering and to cure disease and to save lives than we can possibly imagine. That is the kind of thing people expect of us, don’t they, in the Senate? The Democrats and Republicans will find a common goal and work together to achieve it. L
AMAR ALEXANDER was part of that successful effort. I am going to hold him to it for the next 2 years, as I am sure he will hold me to the same goal. I look forward to work-ing with him but certainly with some pain in my heart, as the Democratic leader said, with the knowledge his ca-reer is coming to an end. He has been an extraordinary public servant as a Governor, as a Presidential candidate, as a Cabinet member, and as a Member of the U.S. Senate. I am sorry for his decision, but I certainly understand why he would make that on a personal and family basis. 
FIRST STEP ACT  
Madam President, I wish to say a few words about the legislation currently pending before the U.S. Senate. Every once in a while—it doesn’t happen very often—the stars line up and the Demo-crats and Republicans and the conserv-atives and the progressives and the President and the Congress agree on something. I am not talking about Flag Day or apple pie or whether Las-sie was a collie dog. It really comes down, occasionally, to something that is meaningful. We are in the midst now of a debate on the floor of the Senate, which will culminate probably tomor-row in some historic votes on the whole question of criminal justice re-form. How important is this issue? It is so important that we rarely take it up more than once a decade; that we sit down and look at criminal justice standards and laws in America and de-cide whether we can make them better and more effective. Just a few minutes ago, my colleague from Texas, Senator C
ORNYN , a con-servative Republican, came to the floor and explained how the State of Texas engaged in prison reform and found out they could not only reduce the prison population but reduce the incidence of crime at the same time. That is what we are setting out to do at the Federal level as well. Senator CORNYN ’s prison reform measure, which he introduced with Senator S
HELDON WHITEHOUSE of Rhode Island, has been a central part of our conversation on criminal justice re-form. I had another part of criminal justice reform that I have been working on for a long time. Three decades ago, Con-gress responded to our Nation’s drug epidemic by creating the harshest man-datory minimum sentences in our his-tory. Consider what happened next as we made the penalties for drug use and sales higher than ever in our history. What happened next was the use of ille-gal drugs in the United States of Amer-ica actually increased, just the oppo-site of what we were trying to achieve. The availability of heroin, cocaine, and methamphetamine increased, despite harsh criminal penalties. Crime rates for Federal drug offenders did not go down. In other words, longer prison terms did not deter drug use or drug crime, but they did lead to an explo-sion in our Federal prisons. Since 1980, the Federal prison popu-lation has grown by over 700 percent. Federal prison spending has increased by nearly 600 percent in that period of time. Today, the United States of America holds more prisoners, by far, in prison than any country in the world. America has 5 percent of the world’s population, 25 percent of the world’s prisoners—more than Russia or China. Our overcrowded Federal pris-ons consume one-quarter of the Justice Department’s discretionary budget. This undermines other important pri-orities, like preventing crime in our neighborhoods and treating drug addic-tion. The largest increase in the Federal prison population is for nonviolent drug offenders. This is largely because of the inflexible mandatory minimum sentences. These mandatory penalties don’t allow judges to distinguish be-tween drug kingpins, who should be our focus when it comes to criminal pen-alties, and lower level offenders. That isn’t fair. It isn’t smart. It isn’t an ef-fective way to keep us safe. We also have to consider the racially disparate impact of these laws. Listen, the majority of illegal drug users and dealers in America are White, but three-quarters of the people serving time in prison for drug offenses are Af-rican American or Latino. The major-ity of the users and dealers are White, and three-fourths of those who go to prison for drug crimes are African American and Latino, and the large majority of those subject to Federal mandatory minimum penalties fall into that same group of African Ameri-cans and Latinos. As a result of mandatory minimums, the families of nonviolent offenders are separated for years on end. Most of

these families are people of color. This has a destructive impact on their com-munities and erodes faith among them in our criminal justice system. Most Senators don’t come to the floor and say what I am about to say, but let me tell you the worst vote I ever cast. I was a Member of the House of Representatives, and it was about 25 or 26 years ago when I voted for a law that established what became known as the crack powder sentencing dis-parity. That jumble of words means that under this law, it took 100 times more powder cocaine than crack co-caine to trigger the same minimum sentence—100 times. This came to be known as the 100-to-1 crack-to-powder disparity. Under this law 80 percent of the people sentenced for crack cocaine offenses were African American. In 2010 I worked with an unlikely ally, then-Senator Jeff Sessions from Alabama. He was a Republican Senator and a member of the Judiciary Com-mittee, and he felt strongly about this issue. I said to him: Senator Sessions, 100 to 1 isn’t fair—that for a tiny handful of crack and a handful of powder co-caine, the handful of crack would get 100 times the sentence as the cocaine doesn’t make any sense. We debated back and forth. I thought it should be one to one in the sen-tencing. He didn’t agree, but the day fi-nally came when we had to make a de-cision. We actually bargained in the Senate gym. I know the Democratic leader referred to that gym earlier. We get a lot of business done there. We were bargaining in the gym on the day of the committee markup—back and forth and back and forth. Finally, the two of us agreed that it would go from 100 to 1 to 18 to 1. I can’t tell you why 18, but it was a compromise. It dra-matically reduced the disparity in sen-tencing between crack cocaine and powder cocaine. That Fair Sentencing Act passed the Senate Judiciary Committee, the Sen-ate, the House Judiciary Committee, and the House, and it was signed into law in a very private ceremony by President Obama, which Senator Ses-sions and I attended. For the last 5 years, I have been working on the next step—a bipartisan coalition of Republican and Demo-cratic Senators to take the next step on reforming our Federal drug sen-tencing laws. Five years ago I joined up with another unlikely ally—M
IKELEE, a very, very conservative Republican from Utah—to introduce a bill called the Smarter Sentencing Act. We had a problem. There was a Republican Sen-ator who didn’t like the bill at all. His name? C
HUCK GRASSLEY , from Iowa, a conservative Republican. Coinciden-tally, he is chairman of the Senate Ju-diciary Committee. After a while, I said to Senator L
EE: We are going nowhere without Grass-ley. We have to get him on board if we are going to change the law. It took a year, which is just a few minutes in Senate time. It took a year of negotiating for us to finally reach an agreement that CHUCK GRASSLEY and M
IKELEEand I all signed on to for sen-tencing reform. We were joined by Senator C
ORY B
OOKER in the last year or two, a Dem-ocrat from New Jersey. After more than a year of negotiations, we intro-duced the Sentencing Reform and Cor-rections Act, legislation approved by the Judiciary Committee by a vote of 16 to 5 earlier this year. Around the same time, the House of Representatives passed bipartisan leg-islation to reform the Federal prison system. This bill was supported—listen to this—by President Donald Trump, cosponsored by Republican Congress-man D
OUG COLLINS , Democratic Con-gressman H
AKEEM JEFFRIES of New York, and Republican House Judiciary Committee chairman B
OBGOODLATTE  of Virginia. I didn’t like the original version of this bill because I thought we could do better and we should add criminal sen-tencing to prison reform. Then we did something that is rare. We sat down, Democrats and Repub-licans, and worked it out. We believed that we could come up with a common bipartisan bill by combining the two. The result is the most extraordinary political coalition I have ever wit-nessed in the time I have been in Wash-ington. The so-called FIRST STEP Act—the revised FIRST STEP Act—is a bipartisan sentencing and prison re-form bill that is sponsored by 34 Sen-ators—17 Republicans and 17 Demo-crats. It is supported by President Trump and a broad spectrum of stake-holders. Listen to who is supporting this bill on criminal sentencing reform and prison reform: the Fraternal Order of Police. That is a good starting point. It is the largest police group in America. There is the National District Attor-neys Association, the largest group of prosecutors in America. So we have the police and the prosecutors, and we also have the American Civil Liberties Union. Go figure that a bill we put to-gether could bring these folks together in common purpose to pass it. Our bill would reduce Federal manda-tory minimum sentences in a targeted way. We don’t repeal any mandatory minimum sentences, and we don’t lower any maximum sentences. We would simply allow Federal judges to determine in certain low-level cases, on a case-by-case basis, when the harshest penalties should apply. The bill also puts in place a recidi-vism reduction program and prison re-form that will facilitate the successful rehabilitation and reentry of prisoners, which Senator C
ORNYN addressed just a few minutes earlier. Let me tell you a story about this man here. His name is Alton Mills. In the year 1994, at the age of 24, Alton Mills was given a mandatory life sen-tence without parole for a low-level nonviolent drug offense. When Alton Mills stepped into that Federal prison cell with a life sentence, he was stepping into a jail cell for the first time in his life, and he was bound to stay there for the rest of his life. I ended up being contacted by his public defender. She has this wonderful name. She is from Chicago. Her name is MiAngel Cody. MiAngel Cody con-tacted me and told me Alton Mills’ story—how this kid growing up in Chi-cago, a decent kid in high school, made a bad turn, got mixed up with a drug gang, was a sales runner on the street, which is just the lowest possible level, and on a third offense got a life sen-tence to spend the rest of his life in prison. I asked President Obama to take a look at this and consider commutation. In December of 2015, after serving 22 years in prison, Alton Mills came home to Chicago. What has he done since then? He has become a mechanic at the Chicago Transit Authority. He got married. He is contributing to society. He has a granddaughter. He is working as a community college student pursuing an associate’s degree. If he hadn’t re-ceived a pardon, Alton Mills was des-tined to die in prison because of the Federal sentencing laws that we are setting out to change. The FIRST STEP Act would elimi-nate this mandatory life sentence for nonviolent drug offenders like Alton Mills, and the bill would also give a chance to thousands of people still serving sentences for nonviolent of-fenses involving crack cocaine under the 100-to-1 standard I mentioned ear-lier. I am going to have more to say about the pending amendments, which will be brought up tomorrow. The Senator from Arkansas is going to offer three amendments that I consider to be poi-son pills. After 6 years of hard work putting these bills together—Democrats and Republicans, police, prosecutors, the ACLU, and President Trump and Sen-ator DURBIN together on a bill—now comes the Senator from Arkansas, who has introduced three amendments which I think are very destructive to this bill. I am going to oppose all three of them, and I hope he will think twice about them. We have an opportunity to do some-thing significant, historic, and bipar-tisan here for the good of this Nation. We could end up reducing the crime rate in our country and do it in a smarter way with sentencing and pris-on reform. The amendments that he will propose tomorrow—the Senator from Arkansas—have been opposed by groups across the board—left and right, conservative, progressive, Republican, and Democrat. They all oppose his amendments. I am not going to get into a specific discussion about them until later, but I wanted to let the Senator from Arkan-sas know that we are hopeful that he will take a more constructive ap-proach. If he goes with the amend-ments that we have seen, we are going to have to do our best to oppose him.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES7646 December 17, 2018 
Some are going to suggest that the underlying bill doesn’t go far enough to unwind the harsh mandatory sen-tencing that I mentioned earlier. I agree. But that is the nature of legisla-tion. It is the nature of compromise. It is what the Senate is all about. A Re-publican-controlled Senate is consid-ering a bill supported by Senators from both sides of the aisle, and we have a chance to do something. Congress should make this bipartisan legislation a fitting ending to this year. For all of the cynicism and skepticism about what Congress can achieve, we can prove as soon as tomorrow, with one of the most historic changes in criminal justice legislation in our history, that we can work together for the good of this Nation. Our people who send us to this job expect no less. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Alabama. Mr. JONES. Madam President, I rise today to talk on two issues. First, I would like to talk about the criminal justice reform act that Sen-ator D
URBIN just spoke of. Rather than repeating all that has been said and all of the positive things—and Senator D
URBIN did an outstanding job out-lining all of the issues and how impor-tant this bill is for the criminal justice system and for the American public—I would like to take a moment just to commend my colleagues—particularly Senator D
URBIN and Senator G RASSLEY , Senator L
EE, Senator B OOKER , col-leagues in the House of Representa-tives, and those at the White House who worked so tirelessly over the years to achieve this result. This is a re-markable achievement for the people of this country. I have worked, as most people in this body know, for a number of years as both a prosecutor and as a defense law-yer. In that capacity, I have seen first-hand the problems in a system of jus-tice that seems to have gotten out of whack and that has incarcerated so many people—more than just about any civilized country in the world—and yields very little results. So what I see is an effort of Repub-licans and Democrats coming together. When I ran for this office last year, I talked consistently about a country and the State of Alabama that had more in common than we have to di-vide us. I talked more about reaching across the aisle and having dialogues, instead of monologues. This bill is the perfect example of that, and I hope the people of America see what this bill does and see how this body and the House of Representatives and the ad-ministration came together to pass this historic legislation. This is a historic moment, Madam President. This is one for the ages, there is no question. Sometimes it is so disappointing to go back home to Ala-bama and hear people say: ‘‘All I want you to do is work together.’’ All they see are dueling press con-ferences among the leaders and dueling talk shows on Sunday mornings and on CNN and MSNBC and FOX News, and they think that all we do is stand here and fight each other. That is not the case. We have done some great things in the Senate since I have been here on January 3. Our appropriations process has been rolling on a bipartisan level. We passed the opioid crisis bill. We also have the farm bill done. Now, with criminal justice—it is the crowning achievement on what has been, over the years, one of the most contentious issues in America. Every year, I used to say that the system of justice in America that was damaged the most in election was our criminal justice sys-tem because it seemed that everybody wanted to demagogue it today. That is no longer the case in what has been done in this body, the House, and with the support of the White House. I want to commend all of those who have been involved in this over the years before I got here, both in and out of government. I worked for a number of years with the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU—particularly the law enforcement leaders—to reduce crime and incarceration. We put in countless hours, and this is the culmination of a number of years of work. They should be commended for all they did. (Mr. MORAN assumed the Chair.) REMEMBERING GILES PERKINS  
Mr. President, I want to talk about a matter that is a lot more personal. The last couple of weeks have been some-what difficult for me on a very per-sonal level. Not only have I been sad-dened that several of my colleagues whom I admire so much will be leaving this body, but 2 weeks ago, I lost a dear friend and trusted adviser, Giles Per-kins of Birmingham, AL. I so appreciate the fact that the day after his death, when I just could not hold up and hold it together to do so myself, Senator S
CHUMER noted his passing in floor remarks. Giles’ family appreciates those remarks as well, but because he meant so much to his adopted State of Alabama and the Bir-mingham community and the fact that he is the one who guided the effort to elect me to this office, it is only fitting that I honor his memory on the floor of the Senate. Giles was a former director of the Alabama Democratic Party and some-one who worked for the last two Ala-bama Democratic Governors. Origi-nally from Texas, he came to Alabama after marrying the love of his life, Hillery Head, in the early 1990s. To-gether, they have three children: Bar-ton, Hugh, and Beverly. For all that he did in life and all that he accom-plished, which was quite a lot, Giles was first and foremost a husband and father, a family man whose greatest love and source of pride were his wife and children. When he arrived in Alabama, he im-mediately began to get involved in the community and in politics. He got in-volved in the Folsom campaign for Governor, telling people that he simply wanted to make a difference. Over the next 25 years, he did just that. What a difference he made. While Giles was actively involved in numerous civic groups and projects, his greatest accomplishment was turning a few blighted blocks of real estate in the heart of the city of Birmingham into a stunning outdoor recreational area known as Railroad Park, which has not only provided a space for family enjoy-ment but spurred economic develop-ment and became a catalyst for revi-talization in downtown Birmingham. Giles was an outstanding lawyer and community organizer, but he had poli-tics in his blood, and he learned the ins and outs of the shark infested waters of Alabama politics like no other. It was Giles whom I first approached about running for a statewide office be-cause I knew he shared my frustration with the state of politics and govern-ment in the State of Alabama. It was Giles and Doug Turner who sat me down to explain about running for the U.S. Senate—where my heart has al-ways been, having worked here just out of law school—why it was important to run for that office; why, given my background as a U.S. attorney and as a lawyer known for civil rights work, the special election would be so important. It was also Giles who brought in Joe Trippi, everyone else on my campaign team, and helped me staff my Senate office. But rather than calling him a polit-ical mentor, which just doesn’t seem to capture all that he was, I often referred to him as ‘‘Yoda,’’ a political Jedi mas-ter, because of his vision and intuition for politics and how politics should translate into public service. He was certainly a master in teaching those around him how they could be wise in the ways of the force of politics. His strategy for my campaign and my Sen-ate office and tenure was molded out of a vision of how Alabama and the South can move beyond the issues that have divided us and how we can lead the Na-tion in coming together and healing the partisan divide. Many think that my election was his greatest political achievement, but knowing him as I did, he would more likely say that it was not the election per se but the reaction that the elec-tion gave to so many people in Ala-bama and around the country who sim-ply said that it gave them hope. That hope for a better Alabama, for a better South, and for a better America was his No. 1 priority. He was brilliant, philosophical, tena-cious, stubborn, funny, and so straight-forward that you thought he was some-times just a little bit mean—a trait you often have to have in order to have a successful campaign. The absolutely remarkable thing about Giles, though, was that he man-aged my campaign on a daily basis—all of the calls, emails, and all of the meetings knowing he was living on bor-rowed time. At the time we began the campaign, he was a 2 year survivor of

pancreatic cancer, an aggressive form of cancer that takes no prisoners. Through it all, he suffered through a number of treatments, often texting or emailing orders or streams of con-sciousness while being hooked up to chemotherapy. When asked why he was doing all of this under the strain and pain of his cancer and his treatments, he matter of factly said: ‘‘Because I want to show my children what is important and how to live.’’ I am confident that his chil-dren got that, as did I and everyone else associated with our campaign. Giles lost his battle on December 2, having survived for 3
1⁄2years after being told he only had 1 month to live. In the world of pancreatic cancer, a 3
1⁄2- year survivor is remarkable in itself, but Giles Perkins was a remarkable human who made such a positive im-pact on all who knew him. As a friend recently wrote me, ‘‘It is because of unsung heroes such as Giles that democracy is sustained in Amer-ica’’ and that we are ‘‘grateful for his commitment and life’s work to main-taining integrity in government.’’ I know this: When the history of Ala-bama and the politics of my State and the region are written, it will be Giles Perkins who will be credited for begin-ning a political change that will be felt for a long, long time. On a personal level, he will never leave my heart and soul. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-sent that the remarks I made at Giles’ memorial last Friday be printed in the R
ECORD . There being no objection, the mate-rial was ordered to be printed in the R
ECORD , as follows: 
GILES PERKINS , RAILROAD PARKMEMORIAL , D
ECEMBER 14, 2018 It is, I believe, a rare occasion when some-one stands before a grieving crowd in an ef-fort to memorialize more than a relative or close friend but someone who was the driving force behind making a lifelong dream come true. That folks is the challenge I have faced the last twelve days–Giles was my dear friend but as you all know he was also the person primarily responsible for making my lifelong dream of being a United States Sen-ator become a reality. I have also faced the double challenge of not having Giles around to help with my re-marks. For the last 18 months or so he helped me craft so many of my speeches, from the campaign stump speeches to my maiden speech on the floor of the Senate, to a broad speech about the South and our place in history that could be adopted in a number of contexts. He was always thinking of a bigger picture than most of us were thinking of and regardless of who the mes-senger was going to be, Giles wanted to con-trol the message to the extent that he could. He had the confidence and self assurance, and let’s face a little bit of arrogance—to craft the message that he believed should be delivered. Giles knew he his fate several weeks ago and was able to help plan this day, but when he really started to go down, he went down rather fast. So that is why I am convinced that he is looking down on us today and somewhat cringing with anxiety of not really knowing what any of us are going to say. For me in particular, knowing how he has helped manage me the last 18 months my guess is that when Hillery and the kids start going through his papers or his notes on his IPad there will be something ti-tled ‘‘Notes for Jones to say at my memo-rial.’’ Well my friend, I guess I will have to give it a shot without you. One of the people in history that Giles ad-mired most was Robert Kennedy and in many ways his life mirrored that of Bobby’s. Giles was as tough as nails, who had as firm a grip on life and people as anyone I have ever known. Louise often called him a gunslinger who could quickly shoot you down with simply an expression or comment. But he also had a very soft and gentle side, especially with his family. Above all else Giles was a family many totally devoted to Hillery and his children Barton, Hugh and Beverly. He adored them all and no matter what challenges he took on, from being a lawyer, a community activist, a political candidate, a campaign strategist or a war-rior against cancer, Giles always made time for his family. He not only loved them but he believed in them. For all the successes he had in life, including the election of a mayor, a Governor and a US Senator, his wife and children were his greatest source of pride. Giles was also a visionary. One of Bobby Kennedy’s more famous quotes was ‘‘Some men see things as they are and say why, I dream things that never were and say why not?’’ Whether he did it consciously or sub-consciously Giles was the embodiment of that spirit. You only have to look around you today and this magnificent park that has done so much for the City of Bir-mingham and understand what I mean. Few could have stood at the corner of an aban-doned, almost blighted part of town and see a vision of an outdoor park where people from all walks of life can come and enjoy the outdoors, that would be a safe gathering spot for fun and creativity, that could attract the kind of development that allows a city to thrive. But Giles did, simply seeing that vi-sion and saying why not. You can see it in the zoo, where he and others saw the poten-tial of having a world class attraction free from the constraints of being owned by the city. But Giles, did and he said why not. And today the zoo is on the verge of a renaissance like it has never experienced. And I am standing before you today as a Unites States Senator because along with his political partners of many years, Doug Turner and Joe Trippi, Giles saw an opening for a new Alabama, an Alabama that puts aside the di-visions of the past and embraces our diver-sity and sense of respect and civility for all people. An Alabama who could lead the South. When all of the pundits looked at a Senate race in Alabama and dismissed the idea saying that it was not possible for a Democrat to win, saying why would anyone even try, Giles Perkins saw an opening, with someone who shared his vision for a better Alabama and a better South who could lead the nation out of our divisiveness and he said why not. Giles got into politics for the right rea-sons. Not for ego or power but to do good things. He got that from his mother, who was a progressive member of the Texas state board of education. When he first moved to Alabama after marrying Hillery he ap-proached the Folsom campaign about getting involved. He told Peck Fox that he was from Texas but was settling in Alabama and that he wanted to get involved in the campaign because he wanted to make a difference. And for the next 25 years what a difference he did make. Electing Don Siegelman Governor. Re-electing Richard Arrington as Mayor. Being Executive Director of the Alabama Democratic Party, being a candidate for At-torney General and electing a US Senator. But you can do all of those things when you are in politics for the right reason, to make a positive difference in people’s lives. Giles believed that all people, regardless of race or religion or gender of sexual orientation or status in life should be treated equally and with respect and he had no tolerance for those that did not. That drive to make Alabama and the South a better place is what drove him to know and understand all things that could bring about political success. I called him Yoda for a reason. He taught me and so many others the ways of the Force in poli-tics, to stay in our lane and to focus on that which was truly important. That was espe-cially tough for me as I also had that type A personality and was constantly veering off course because I had become so concerned about minutiae. So even though my calling him Yoda was a term of affection and respect he called me Chicken Little as a reminder of just how much I did not know. He was a tough task master when it came to politics. His firm grip on life and people became like a vise when he was engaged in politics. He was smart, confident, efficient and forgiving, at least to a point. He gave so many young folks a chance but they had to perform and live up to his expectations. They loved him and they feared him. Again, he modeled himself after Bobby Kennedy who said about being the campaign manager for JFK in 1960: ‘‘I’m not running a popu-larity contest. It doesn’t matter if people like me or not. Jack can be nice to them. I don’t try to antagonize people, but somebody has to be able to say no. If people are not getting off their behinds, how do you say that nicely?’’ I am told that when Giles began hiring young talent to run the Alabama Democratic Party that the kids began to notice that Fri-days were often the days where Giles would politely but pointedly explain to someone that they were just not working out and should hit the road. Instead buckling down to make sure they weren’t next they just quit coming in on Fridays. As you might imagine with Giles at the helm that was rel-atively short lived and the party prospered because of his leadership. The same was true in our campaign last year. Because Giles knew that we had to run a different campaign than any Democrat had run in the last 20 years he did not rely on those who had been in campaigns in the past, but a new generation, one who understood social media and today’s world but yet could be taught the ways of the Force when it came to old school politics. The kids we brought on had virtually no real political ex-perience but immediately set out to teach them, bringing in books about RFK and Lyn-don Johnson and the modern political sys-tem. By his example of being engaged every-day, whether in the campaign office or by phone or by e-mail or text, while also bat-tling cancer and chemotherapy treatments he taught them, and all of us, lessons of both politics and life. But make no mistake, while they loved and admired him they were also scared to death of him. One of our young men said that every time Giles walked into the room his male body parts seemed to re-treat into his gut. Believe me, I get that. While Yoda could be a gentle teacher we also have scars from his light saber that came in the form of his e-mails or text messages or biting retorts if you were out of line. I am quite sure that as word spread of Giles deci-sion to not seek further treatments for his cancer all of those who worked with him or for him at any point in any of his political endeavors were reminded of the words of Winston Churchill who famously said: ‘‘I am prepared to meet my Maker. Whether my

Maker is prepared for the great ordeal of meeting me is another matter.’’ But it was that same young staffer who also said that as our campaign folks called to check on each other after Giles’ death each call ended with ‘‘Love ‘ya’’ and it was clear that Giles built more than a campaign, he built a family that would long outlive him. Over the last couple of years I came to love Giles like a brother and came to know and appreciate him as a remarkable human being who did so much for so many in his short time on this planet. He died among the privi-leged but never, ever forgot those less fortu-nate, constantly striving for a better world for all. The words of Barack Obama at the funeral for Ted Kennedy seem to have been written in advance for Giles Perkins: We cannot know for certain how long we have here. We cannot foresee the trials or misfortunes that will test us along the way. We cannot know what God’s plan is for us. What we can do is to live out our lives as best we can with purpose, and with love, and with joy. We can use each day to show those who are closest to us how much we care about them, and treat others with the kindness and re-spect that we wish for ourselves. We can learn from our mistakes and grow from our failures. And we can strive at all costs to make a better world, so that someday, if we are blessed with the chance to look back on our time here, we know that we spent it well; that we made a difference; that our fleeting presence had a lasting impact on the lives of others. This is how Giles Perkins lived. This world is better for having pass here. We are better people because we knew him. This is his leg-acy. So my friend, may you find new challenges to meet and new visions to share, to see things not as they are but how they can be. May God bless you and may you Rest In Peace. And for all eternity, May the Force be with you.

THE BUDGET AND APPROPRIATIONS PROCESS  
REFORM  
Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, earlier this month, Congress sent the President an-other continuing resolution to allow more time to resolve the partisan im-passe that has us on the brink of a gov-ernment shutdown once again. A con-tinuing resolution just allows agencies to continue to spend money without knowing how much they actually get to spend. The current episode is yet another example of the breakdown of what should be the basic nuts and bolts of government—keeping the government open and funded. In other words, they have been spending money since last October without knowing how much money they get to spend. So I come to the floor today to talk about the need to reform our broken budget and appro-priations process and to lay out a few ideas I have for how to do that. As chairman of the Budget Com-mittee, I have worked on budget appro-priations and process reform for sev-eral years and always believed that changes need to be guided by two core principles. The first principle is that reforms should end brinksmanship and the threat of government shutdowns; and No. 2, reforms should guide us to create enforceable plans to stop the outrageous growth of our Federal debt, which is approaching $22 trillion. According to the Congressional Budg-et Office, Federal debt held by the pub-lic, as a percentage of our economy, is at the highest level since shortly after World War II. That debt is expected to rise sharply over the next 30 years if current laws generally remain un-changed. Quite simply, our budget problems are too severe to be put off any longer. Yet our dysfunctional budget and appropriations process is making it harder for Congress to tack-le our pressing fiscal challenges. To start, one easy thing we could do to improve the process is to change the names of the Budget and Appropria-tions Committees to better reflect each committee’s function. The Budget Committee, which is tasked with crafting an annual fiscal framework to guide Congress, really should be called the Debt Control Com-mittee. The Appropriations Com-mittee, which is responsible for mak-ing the actual decisions about how money is spent each year, should be re-named the Budget and Appropriations Committee. Too often, when we come up against appropriations deadlines, as we are now, press reports declare that Con-gress has to pass the budget to avoid a shutdown. Not true. The budget passed a long time ago. In reality, the budget reflects the start of the process, and appropriations reflects the end. Chang-ing these committees’ names would more clearly delineate their actual re-sponsibilities and thereby make it easi-er for them to be carried out and un-derstood by the public. A second important change would be to finally admit that Congress is not capable of sending 12 appropriations bills to the President before the Sep-tember 30 end of the fiscal year each year. The current process leaves Con-gress in a nearly perpetual quest to de-velop and pass 12 funding bills for the next fiscal year to avoid a funding lapse. Yet the sheer size and com-plexity of the Federal budget and ap-propriations process virtually guar-antee that Congress will not consider all the appropriations bills individually each year. In the last 40 years, we have succeeded only four times in passing all of the appropriations bills on time. Let me repeat that. In the last 40 years, we have succeeded only four times in passing all of the appropria-tions bills on time. Our inability to pass appropriations bills on the current schedule has made reliance on continuing resolutions a routine part of the process, and it comes with a cost. The Department of Defense has operated under a con-tinuing resolution for an average of 81 days per year; that is almost 3 months per year since 2001, with a particularly bad spate since 2009, in which we aver-aged 134 days per year. That is almost 4
1⁄2months of not knowing how much they are going to get to spend, let alone planning for the future. Earlier this year, the Secretary of the Navy, Richard Spencer, identified $4 billion in waste owing to the lack of financial stability resulting from these continuing resolutions—this lack of knowing how much to spend. He said: 
Since 2001, we have put $4 billion in the trash can, poured lighter fluid on top of it, and burned it. . . . It’s enough money that it can buy us the additional capacity and capa-bility that we need. Instead, the $4 billion of taxpayer money has been lost because of in-efficiencies [caused by] continuing resolu-tions. 
While it is true that this year we were able to pass and get signed five appropriation bills prior to September 30—remarkably, an improvement from recent years—that still leaves seven bills yet to be enacted. To address this problem, I have pro-posed moving to a biennial system and halving the number of appropriations

bills considered each year so that six would be considered in the first session of Congress and six would be considered in the second—each of them, of course, for 2 years to allow for more planning. By providing a more realistic and at-tainable schedule, we could allow for a more thoughtful process for consid-ering individual bills. We would free up more time for oversight of Federal spending. We would actually get to look at some of the details of the dol-lars we are spending, and we would re-duce the likelihood of continuing reso-lutions and large, year-end spending bills—with everything attached to it— that are inefficient and too often load-ed with waste. We could also give agen-cies the certainty they need to plan and make wise decisions regarding how to implement funding. But successful and timely enactment of the appropriations bills is only part of the solution. We also need to look at the mandatory side of the ledger and programs that don’t have adequate rev-enue to maintain obligations—the ones we don’t ever get to make a decision on. Any new mandatory programs should be self-financing or offset by the elimination of existing programs that we would continue to fund. In other words, nothing should be mandatory if it doesn’t have a stream of money big enough to pay for it. We also need to look at ending the spending bias that begins with a cur-rent baseline—current amount of spending—and automatically adjusts for inflation. To address the long-term structural deficit problems, we need to create en-forceable spending targets that are monitored and enforced annually to make sure lawmakers stay focused on deficit reduction and achieving a suit-able Federal budget. The newly re-vamped Debt Control Committee should be empowered to establish its targets and enforce spending con-straints. For example, if we followed my penny plan and cut spending by 1 cent out of every dollar each year for the next 5 years, we could balance the budget. Once enforceable targets are agreed upon, we should conform the debt limit to them. I know that dealing with the debt limit in a responsible manner is a priority for many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. I am ready to work with them on it. We are not talking about sequester here; I am suggesting precision cuts on the low priorities. First of all, seques-ter happened late in the year, so there wasn’t much money left to take the money out of, which made it a much larger reduction from those spending bills. They also picked the projects they thought would be most noticeable and cut those, realizing that the Amer-ican public would rise up in arms and make sure that it was reinstated, and that happened. They always picked the most visible and the most painful. What we have to do is get to preci-sion cuts in the things we haven’t even looked at. I have a list of how many things we haven’t looked at. Some pro-grams haven’t been looked at since 1983, but they continue to get an an-nual inflation increase anyway—some-times greater than the annual increase. Each of the above suggestions would improve our process, help us control spending, and meet our constitutional obligations. I plan to pursue them in the next Congress and look forward to working with my colleagues on these and other ideas. However, while reforms are needed, the reality is there will never be a per-fect process, and no reform by itself could force the hard decisions that are needed. What we need is leadership and a commitment from both sides to work together to do what we know needs to be done to confront these challenges. I look forward to working with my colleagues on these critical challenges in the next Congress. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Iowa. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, be-fore I start my remarks, in case they go beyond the time for a vote, I ask unanimous consent to finish my re-marks. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

Mr. GRASSLEY. We are here today to begin debate on a piece of legisla-tion called the FIRST STEP Act of 2018. This happens to be the most sig-nificant criminal justice reform bill in a generation. Our country is based upon the rule of law. If someone commits a crime, they should be punished, and that punish-ment should be severe enough to deter others from committing crimes. But for our criminal justice system to serve our society well, it has to do more than punish and deter. Recidi-vism rates are far too high and drive crime rates up. In the Federal system, 49 percent of prisoners are rearrested within 8 years, and 32 percent are con-victed of new crimes. We must better prepare prisoners to leave behind their criminal past and to become produc-tive citizens when they leave the pris-on system. We also need to make sure that criminal sentences are tough enough to punish and deter, but not be unjustly harsh. Sentences should not destroy the opportunity of redemption for in-mates willing to get right with the law. The FIRST STEP Act is tough on crime, but it is also fair. To tackle the recidivism rates in our country, the bill establishes evidence-based pro-gramming that has reduced recidivism at the State level. We have evidence from the States of Texas, Georgia, Mis-sissippi, and many others to justify that fact. The bill provides incentives for in-mates willing to put in the work to complete these programs. Under this bill, a prisoner may earn 10 days of time credit for every 30 days of success-ful participation, which they can apply toward prerelease custody. However, access to these incentives is available only to those who pose little risk of committing new crimes. The FIRST STEP Act requires the Bureau of Prisons to implement a risk assessment system to determine an in-mate’s risk of returning to crime after prison. Access to the earned-time credits is limited to those who pose a minimum or low risk. The bill also makes clear that violent and high-risk criminals convicted of certain serious offenses are ineligible for the prerelease cus-tody program. The list of disqualifying offenses in-cludes crimes relating to terrorism, murder, sexual exploitation of chil-dren, and gun crimes, among others that are listed in the bill. All fentanyl traffickers are disqualified from earn-ing time credits. The bill also makes sentencing fairer by returning some discretion to judges during sentencing. Some have called for eliminating mandatory minimums or cutting them back severely. I happen to be a supporter of manda-tory minimum sentences because it helps law enforcement take down criminal enterprises, but at the same time, I recognize there is some unfair-ness in how these mandatory minimum sentences are sometimes applied. The FIRST STEP Act leaves in place these maximum sentences but also addresses overly harsh and expensive mandatory minimums for certain nonviolent of-fenders. Locking up low-level offenders for needlessly long prison sentences di-verts resources that are needed else-where to fight crime. To address this, the FIRST STEP Act makes a number of changes to sen-tencing guidelines. First, the legisla-tion clarifies that enhanced penalties for using a firearm during a crime of violence or drug crime should be re-served for repeat offenders of such crimes. That is what Congress had in-tended when it created the enhanced penalty in the first place. Second, the bill would reduce the three-strike penalty for life imprison-ment to 25 years. The 20-year minimum is reduced to 15 years. The bill also broadens the mandatory penalties, ap-plying them to more of the worst criminals. Third, the bill provides for more judi-cial discretion by expanding the exist-ing Federal safety valve to include more low-level, nonviolent offenders. Consistent with the existing law, the judge cannot apply the safety valve un-less the defendant has fully cooperated with law enforcement. Lastly, the bill also allows for the retroactive application of the Fair Sen-tencing Act of 2010, which reduced the 100-to-1 disparity in sentencing be-tween crack and powder cocaine. I want to acknowledge President Trump’s leadership on criminal justice reform. Without the President’s en-gagement, we wouldn’t be here today.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES7650 December 17, 2018 
The President deserves credit for brokering a deal that improves fairness and supports law enforcement. A tremendous amount of credit is also due to my colleagues in the Senate who helped to forge a bipartisan com-promise on complex issues. I emphasize ‘‘bipartisan compromise’’ because the people in the grassroots of America, even in my State of Iowa, think there isn’t much bipartisanship going on here. I would especially like to thank my colleague, Senator D
URBIN . He has been a partner through this entire process. A bipartisan cosponsor includes Sen-ator L
EE, who has done a tremendous amount of work on this. In fact, he started with Senator D
URBIN before I even got involved. We also have co-sponsorships by Senators B
OOKER , GRA-
HAM, W HITEHOUSE , SCOTT, FEINSTEIN , C
ORNYN , and L EAHY . They all deserve praise for reaching this deal. The product of years of negotiating and listening to each other is a bill that will reduce crime, strengthen faith in our judicial system, support law enforcement, and give thousands of people a better shot at living good lives. As we go to this very important first vote on this bill, which is to invoke cloture, I urge all of my colleagues to join with President Trump and our bi-partisan coalition of supporters to sup-port the FIRST STEP Act. I yield the floor.

CLOTURE MOTION  
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will state. The legislative clerk read as follows: 
CLOTURE MOTION  We, the undersigned Senators, in accord-ance with the provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the mo-tion to concur in the House amendment to S. 756, a bill to reauthorize and amend the Ma-rine Debris Act to promote international ac-tion to reduce marine debris, and for other purposes, with a further amendment num-bered SA 4108. Mitch McConnell, Mike Lee, John Cor-nyn, Chuck Grassley, Orrin G. Hatch, Tim Scott, Steve Daines, Jerry Moran, Todd Young, Susan M. Collins, Pat Roberts, Bill Cassidy, Lamar Alex-ander, Lindsey Graham, Jeff Flake, Rob Portman, Joni Ernst. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unan-imous consent, the mandatory quorum call has been waived. The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the motion to concur in the House amendment to S. 756, to reauthorize and amend the Ma-rine Debris Act to promote inter-national action to reduce marine de-bris, and for other purposes, with a fur-ther amendment numbered 4108, shall be brought to a close? The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. CORNYN. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator from Tennessee (Mr. ALEXANDER ), the Sen-ator from Louisiana (Mr. C

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be recog-nized for a few moments; that at the conclusion of my remarks, my col-league from Arkansas, Senator C

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST —S. 379 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, one of the things that marks service as a U.S. Senator is the chance to meet really remarkable individuals, and among the remarkable individuals I have had the chance to meet in my time in the Senate, there are few, if any, who are more impressive or mem-orable than those who have been diag-nosed with ALS, commonly known as Lou Gehrig’s disease. Competing with them for being im-pressive and noteworthy are the friends and family and advocates who become their support system and their care-givers. It is not just those with the di-agnosis, but it is also the family, friends, and caregivers who face incred-ible bravery. I remember someone once saying that a special kind of courage is maintaining good morale in the face of terrible circumstances, and few cir-cumstances are more terrible than a di-agnosis of ALS amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We know how it ends. We know it is always fatal. There is no treatment. There is no cure. There is nothing to halt or reverse the effects of ALS. Those of us who have ALS patients visit us watch the decline as they move from people who can walk to people who need a wheelchair, to people who need an increasingly complex wheel-chair. For all this suffering and for all the certainty of how it ends, we still make ALS patients and their family mem-bers wait 5 months before they can begin to receive the Social Security Disability Insurance benefits they earned by contributing into Social Se-curity. The logic, I am told, of this 5-month waiting period is that it allows tem-porary conditions to abate, but ALS is not a temporary condition. It does not abate. It does not reverse. Sadly, some ALS patients lose their fight with the disease before even receiving benefits. I have been working with Senator COTTON to pursue bipartisan legislation to eliminate this 5-month waiting pe-riod for ALS. Chairman H
ATCH , in one of his final acts as chairman of the Fi-nance Committee, expressed his ap-proval of this and his desire to help me bring it forward, and Ranking Member W
YDEN on the Finance Committee has helped get it to the floor so we can have this opportunity to pass it by unanimous consent. I hope very much that as a simple act of humanity, we can step aside from bureaucratic considerations and allow this small population of Americans who face the extraordinary blow of this diagnosis to move immediately to the benefits they signed up for by contrib-uting to Social Security. With that, I would yield the floor to Senator C
OTTON of Arkansas. Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Rhode Island for his work on this important issue. I have had numerous ALS sufferers and fam-ily members of those who suffer from ALS approach me about this bill early in my time in the Senate, and I have been grateful for the opportunity to work with the Senator from Rhode Is-land to try to address this very sad problem. ALS is a progressive and disabling disease for which there is no cure. It is

fatal in all cases. Unfortunately, like almost every other condition, ALS suf-ferers are required to wait for 5 months before they receive the Social Security Disability Insurance benefits they have earned; that they earned through a lifetime of paying taxes into Social Se-curity. I understand the purpose of this 5- month waiting period is to weed out temporary conditions, but ALS is not a temporary condition—or to prevent fraudulent claims, but it is hard to imagine anyone making a fraudulent claim on disability based on an ALS di-agnosis. The average disability bene-ficiaries expect to receive benefits for about 20 years, but, unfortunately, those who have been diagnosed with ALS only have a life expectancy of ap-proximately 3 years. Therefore, the dis-ability waiting period of 5 months means that those on ALS will lose, on average, nearly one-seventh of the ben-efits they have paid a lifetime for. Of course, some will lose a lot more be-cause of ALS’s particularly degenera-tive nature. They will lose their fight to the disease before they ever become eligible for their disability benefits. This legislation will simply ensure that those patients and their families can access the benefits they paid into as soon as possible by waiving that 5- month waiting period for disability benefits in this one exceptional case. I understand there is objection about singling out the particular disease or condition. I would, however, say ALS is itself a singularly exceptional condi-tion, and any sufferer of ALS deserves our sympathy, our prayers but also our action on the Senate floor. I also understand there is objection to the cost of the legislation, which would be $270 million over 10 years—no doubt a lot of money to all Ameri-cans—but frankly a small rounding error in the Federal budget. For that matter, it is less than the amount of money for the piece of legislation that is pending on the floor today—a crimi-nal leniency bill that would cost $352 million over 10 years. If we are prepared to allow legisla-tion to go forward that slashes sen-tences for serious drug traffickers and let sex offenders out of prison early, even though it costs $350 million, I would suggest it is a misplaced priority to object to legislation because it costs $270 million. So I hope, along with the Senator from Rhode Island, that we can pass this legislation in this week before Christmas and give some small measure of solace to those who are suf-fering from ALS and their families. I yield back to the Senator from Rhode Island. Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Fi-nance Committee be discharged from further consideration of S. 379, a bill to eliminate the 5-month waiting period for disability insurance benefits under such title for individuals with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; that the Senate proceed to its immediate con-sideration; that the bill be considered read a third time and passed; and that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate, as we come into this Christmas season. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Utah. Mr. LEE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I first became aware of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis when I was in the fifth grade, and I read a story, a book, and later a series of books about my childhood hero Lou Gehrig, whose name is often used syn-onymously with this terrible ailment. It is a tragedy that his life was ended and helped bring about the end of his 2,138 consecutive game playing streak in Major League Baseball. This is a horrible disease, a progres-sive neurodegenerative condition that rapidly attacks the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord and eventually it affects the control of the muscles that are needed to move, to speak, and even to eat and to breathe. Sadly, it is al-ways fatal. The bill now under consideration will grant a waiver from the Social Secu-rity Disability Insurance waiting pe-riod to victims of this terrible disease, no doubt with good, noble intentions, but what we have to remember is that this is not the only tragic disease Americans are dying from. Unfortu-nately, there are many others out there that are equally debilitating and equally fatal, and the Federal Govern-ment should not pick favorites to legis-late from among them. Indeed, this kind of policy and ap-proach to policymaking poses several problems. First, it sets the precedent that some diseases or disabilities de-serve preferential treatment and not necessarily with a distinction that sets them apart from that disparate treat-ment. It would undoubtedly open the door for exemption requests for a myr-iad of other groups who advocate for worthy causes, including any of the 233 compassionate allowance conditions that are already given expedited review for SSDI. I have gone through that list and looked at that list and it contains a lot of other horrible, debilitating deadly diseases, among them non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma that claimed the life of my father 22 years ago, along with a whole lot of other diseases that are deadly, that are painful, that are debilitating, that result in the incapacitation of their victims. On top of all that, this approach will set the stage for only those diseases that have the most recognition and the most political backing to find bill sponsors, while others sit at a relative disadvantage with conditions that are more rare and underfunded. Furthermore, while I am happy to consider working on the waiting period issue, we cannot do so without taking a larger look at SSDI as a whole and its sustainability. We cannot ignore the fact that Social Security is facing long-term insolvency with the DI Trust Fund set to run out in 2032, even sooner than the Old-Age and Survivors Insur-ance Trust Fund is set to expire and from which it has to borrow funds. It is undoubtedly a noble intention to help those with ALS, but we will never have parity if we legislate disease by disease, especially among and between diseases that are comparably debili-tating. I said it is incoherent and un-just to pick one favorite group where there are others that are every bit as deserving. On that basis, I object. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-tion is heard. Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, let me go on the record to say how much I disagree with my colleague’s view of this; the notion that we can’t help anyone until we can help everyone is simply not the way the world works. The notion that we can’t help anyone until we have solved whatever financial problems he sees in Social Security, again, means we will help no one. I do believe Lou Gehrig’s disease is a sufficiently distinct illness, with an in-evitable fatality, and the slow loss of function for the individuals involved as the disease takes away, one by one, their various abilities to stand, to speak, and eat. I think it does set it apart. If the Senator has other illnesses he thinks are equally cruel and equally le-thal that he would like to add to the list, then I think we should consider that. The notion that we can’t help fel-low Americans with this disease be-cause we haven’t solved other problems is one I categorically reject. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Utah. Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I respect-fully, most vehemently disagree with the characterization made by my dis-tinguished colleague, the Senator from Rhode Island. This is not, with all due respect, an instance of ‘‘we can’t help anyone until we help everyone.’’ That is a blatant mischaracterization of the facts. We have already 233 conditions that qual-ify for the compassionate allowance category. If you look through those, they are full of debilitating, life-threatening conditions. Those categories already do receive expedited treatment. They al-ready are in a category where they have to be reviewed and a decision has to be made within a set period of time—I believe, within the range of 5 months. That is a good thing, but it is simply not accurate. In fact, it is blatantly misleading to suggest that my argu-ment here boils down to the notion that we cannot help anyone until we help everyone. That is not true. It is the point here that unless or until we can make a distinction between this condition and the other 233 conditions that are on that list, I see no valid

basis—other than the fact that this one has more political support and, per-haps, more financial backing—to draw that distinction here. I think it is un-fair to those who benefit from and will need to invoke the need for Social Se-curity disability insurance to put it in an even less sustainable posture mov-ing forward. Yes, in an ideal world we would like to say no waiting period for anyone. In an ideal world we would like to not have anyone have to wait for these sorts of things, but we do have, in our government, a susceptibility to claims that are not substantiated, and we also have people who have to review them. In the absence of a perfect system, it may not be possible. It certainly isn’t going to be possible for us to make this program sustainable if we can’t put meaningful limits on it. Again, I am all for finding ways to shorten that waiting period as much as we possibly can. I have yet to hear an argument that sets this condition apart from the others in this category of 233 compassionate allowance condi-tions. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I simply note that the Senator seems to be making precisely the argument that he is denying that he has made. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Utah. Mr. LEE. In no way, shape, or form am I making the argument that we cannot help anyone until we help ev-eryone. That is a mischaracterization of the argument I am making. I am arguing that if, among and be-tween these 233 categories, we can make no principle distinction between this condition and the others, we are mistreating those other people. Who is going to stand here for them? Today, I am going to. On that basis, I object. Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, at the Senator’s desire, he may add any of those whom he wishes, and we will con-sider that going forward. Unless and until he does that, we are in a position that unless we are helping all of them, we will help none of them. I yield the floor. Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CRAPO.

REMEMBERING DR. ORVILLE CLARK, JR. Mr. M
CCONNELL, Mr. President, today it is my privilege to pay tribute to Dr. Orville Clark, Jr., who was laid to rest in Arlington National Ceme-tery. When Dr. Clark passed away ear-lier this year at the age of 92, his fam-ily chose to honor his service in uni-form by burying him at one of our Na-tion’s most sacred sites. A lifelong resident of Pikeville, KY, Orville entered the U.S. Army in De-cember of 1943 to fight against the forces of evil in World War II. He served as a combat medic in the Euro-pean theater, and his children re-counted that Orville suffered a severe injury in 1945 as he attempted to rescue other soldiers. For his courage and sac-rifice on that French battlefield, he earned the Purple Heart, our Nation’s oldest military award still given to servicemembers. After the war, Orville returned to Kentucky and he married Betty Jo the next year. He built an optometry prac-tice and was a leader among his peers as the president of the Kentucky Opto-metric Association. Throughout their 72 years together, the couple raised their children, Alicia and Orville, and instilled in them life’s important les-sons. Later in his life, Orville would walk to a local fast food restaurant every day for a cup of coffee. Apparently he made such an impression on the staff there that, at his funeral in Pike Coun-ty, the crew served as his pall bearers. The Clark family then traveled with his remains to Orville’s final resting place in our Nation’s Capital. On a windy day in Arlington, our Nation rendered military honors and expressed its gratitude to Orville for his service and sacrifice. The men and women of the ‘‘greatest generation’’ often chose to leave the safety of home to defend the freedom of our Nation and of the world. Like so many of his comrades, Orville patrioti-cally stood against the enemies of the United States. In doing so, he displayed the highest values of our Common-wealth and our Nation. As Betty Jo, Alicia, and Orville grieve this loss, our thoughts and prayers are with them. I urge my Senate colleagues to join me in expressing our sincere condolences to the Clark family.

TRIBUTE TO RONNIE ELLIS Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, when he retired last month, Ronnie Ellis closed the book on his long and proud career in journalism. A native of Glasgow, KY, Ronnie spent his profes-sional life writing about the issues im-portant to his fellow Kentuckians and the Commonwealth he loves. In doing so, he shared firsthand insights with his readers about the happenings in their capital and earned a reputation as one of the most trusted voices in Frankfort. Ronnie’s first job in journalism came at the Edmonson News, a family-owned weekly publication in South Central Kentucky. He was so eager to put words in print that he even started working there before he had finished his studies at Western Kentucky Uni-versity in nearby Bowling Green. He clearly had a knack for it. From there, Ronnie worked at both the, Glasgow Daily Times and Henderson Gleaner, two newspapers with historic roots in Western Kentucky. In 2005, he moved to Frankfort and joined the Community Newspaper Holdings, Inc., CNHI, giving Ronnie the opportunity to have his articles print-ed in papers throughout the Common-wealth. His move to CNHI also brought a change in focus, Leading the organi-zation’s bureau in Frankfort, Ronnie kept a close eye on State government and politics. In addition to his written columns, he also became a frequent guest on Kentucky Educational Tele-vision’s public affairs program, ‘‘Com-ment on Kentucky.’’ Through the years, I spoke with Ron-nie about the issues of the day and their importance to our home State. He never shied away from the tough questions, and his professionalism helped set the standard for other jour-nalists. There is good news, however, for Ronnie’s dedicated readers. We aren’t losing his viewpoint forever. In the new year, Ronnie plans to continue writing a regular column for CNI. I would like to take this chance to join Ronnie’s au-dience in thanking him for his years of reporting and wishing him a fulfilling retirement. I ask my Senate colleagues to join Elaine and me in thanking Ron-nie for his commitment to journalism in Kentucky. f 
TRIBUTE TO DAVID FIELDS Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, it is my honor to pay tribute to my friend, David Fields, who is the Butler County judge-executive from my home State of Kentucky. Earlier this year, David an-nounced that his time in public service would come to a close soon, ending more than a decade of leadership and success for those who put their trust in him. After a successful career owning a body shop with his wife, Virginia, David chose to dedicate himself to the service of his community. First elected in 2006, David quickly got to work lead-ing the county. As a former judge-exec-utive myself, I know firsthand just how many responsibilities land on your plate, and David accomplished a great deal along the way. In particular, David has been a won-derful ally to me here in the Senate in our work for this region. The Green River, which flows through Butler County, brings the potential for trans-portation and commerce. I had the op-portunity to work closely with David

during our effort to transfer the owner-ship of the Rochester from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, USACE, to the local community. The dam, which is more man 175 years old and provides a vital water supply to nearly 50,000 Kentuckians, had fallen into disrepair and its uncertain status with the USACE threatened Butler County’s economic future. With David’s advo-cacy, I inserted a provision in a recent water infrastructure bill transferring control of the dam to the local commu-nity. Last year, I also proudly supported the Rochester Dam Regional Water Commission’s application for an eco-nomic development grant to renovate the dam and secure its future for the area. With a $3 million investment, local leaders like David can continue to help this region grow and benefit Kentuckians for years to come. Although I am sorry to see him go, I wish David a wonderful retirement. I am told he looks forward to spending more time with Virginia, his son, Greg, and two granddaughters. I would like to thank David for his leadership of Butler County and for his dedicated service to its citizens. I urge my Sen-ate colleagues to join me in congratu-lating David on this remarkable mile-stone.

TRIBUTE TO JAMES LEWIS Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to con-gratulate my friend, Leslie County clerk James Lewis, on his upcoming re-tirement from public service. For more than three decades, James has worked for his neighbors in local government, earning respect throughout the county and the Commonwealth. As he prepares to leave the Leslie County Clerk’s Of-fice, I want to thank him for his tire-less work and dedication to our State. First elected in 1985, James has been a fixture of his community for more than a generation. Of the many respon-sibilities of a county clerk, perhaps the most important is the operation and safeguarding of Americans’ access to the ballot box. Throughout his service as county clerk, James has overseen nearly 60 elections, including every of-fice from jailer to the President of the United States. Although the tech-nologies involved may have changed, his commitment to his office has never wavered. I have had the pleasure to work with James on a number of projects throughout the years. His pas-sion for the people of Leslie County is apparent in everything he does, and they have been served well by his time in office. James became a respected leader among all 120 county clerks through-out the Commonwealth. From 1994 to this year, he served as the chairman of the Kentucky County Clerk’s Associa-tion Election Committee, adminis-trating election training for all other clerks for more than 20 years. Between 1999–2000, James served as the associa-tion’s president. One of the associa-tion’s initiatives, which James helped found, is the Help A Veteran Everyday, H.A.V.E., Program. James spearheaded one of their projects, which involves repurposing license plates into bird houses. The finished products can then be purchased at the clerk’s offices. Through these efforts, James is helping support Kentucky’s men and women who served our Nation in uniform. Whatever retirement may hold in store for James, I wish him all the best. Perhaps he will spend more time on his hobbies, like gardening or fish-ing. I have no doubt that he will be en-joying more time with his wife, Betty, daughters, Danika and Wendy, and grandchildren, Kelsey and R.J. As he begins his well-deserved retirement, I would like to congratulate James on a distinguished career. I urge my Senate colleagues to join me in thanking James for his remarkable public serv-ice to Leslie County and to the Com-monwealth of Kentucky. f 
TRIBUTE TO TERRY MARTIN Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, it is my privilege to salute my friend, Hart County judge-executive Terry Martin, as he completes his career of public service. Since he took office in 2005, Terry has dedicated nearly every wak-ing hour to his constituents. As he be-gins the next chapter of his life, I would like to remember his lasting record of success and to express my sincere gratitude. After graduating from Western Ken-tucky University, Terry spent 27 years in education. He was a teacher, an ad-ministrator, and a coach helping to guide the next generation. In 2005, Terry was appointed by the Governor to serve as Hart County’s judge-execu-tive, the leading elected official in county government. For Terry, enter-ing public service was like joining the family business. His father, Elroy, was a city judge, a local fire chief, and a county magistrate. His brother, Glenn, was also a magistrate and part of this noble family tradition. The drive to serve his neighbors just seems to run in Terry’s veins. In the county’s top job, Terry had a lot of responsibilities. With a goal to provide essential services to the resi-dents in a fiscally responsible way, Terry consistently went beyond the typical job description. I hear he would even drive a snow plow during winter storms. As a former county judge-exec-utive myself, I know firsthand how dif-ficult a job this can be. Whatever chal-lenge he may have faced, Terry consist-ently excelled and earned the trust of his constituents and his colleagues. During his time in office, I have en-joyed working with Terry on a number of projects to help Kentucky, We col-laborated with the Green River Valley Water District to deliver drinking water to rural parts of the county. Terry also identified the alarming fre-quency of collisions along Interstate 65 in the county. Together, we prioritized resources to expand the highway, pro-moting safety for both families and commercial travelers. As he begins his well-deserved retire-ment, I am confident Terry looks for-ward to spending more time with his loving family. With Carmen, his wife of 40 years, they are proud parents to Lynlea and grandparents to Lyndon and Gwyneth. I wish the entire Martin family the very best as they take this next step together. Along with all those who have benefited from Terry’s service to Hart County and to our Com-monwealth, I would like to say thank you. He’s been a good friend and a strong leader for Kentucky. I urge my Senate colleagues to join me in con-gratulating Judge Terry Martin for a job well-done and wishing him a ful-filling retirement. f 
TRIBUTE TO SARAH NICHOLSON Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, it is my pleasure today to pay tribute to Sarah Nicholson, a great Kentuckian who recently retired from a nearly four-decade career with the Kentucky Hospital Association, KHA. Serving as the vice president of government rela-tions for the statewide professional trade association representing hos-pitals throughout the Commonwealth, Sarah earned a strong reputation for her legislative acumen and her tireless advocacy. As the leader of the association’s public affairs operations, Sarah has worked with members of the Kentucky General Assembly and the executive branch for the advancement of our State’s hospitals. She was also tasked with supporting beneficial legislation at the Federal level. As my staff and I have worked with the KHA through the years, Sarah was an effective advocate for its priorities. In addition to her diligent work for the KHA, Sarah is passionate about bettering educational opportunities around Kentucky. At her alma mater, Western Kentucky University, she served on its board of advisers, its col-lege of health and human services advi-sory board, and its alumni board. Sarah was also a representative on the Kentucky Council on Postsecondary Education Inter-Alumni Council and the Centre College Parents Advisory Committee. As Sarah begins the next chapter of her life, I am confident that she is looking forward to spending more qual-ity time with her family, especially her husband, retired Jefferson County Dis-trict Judge James C. Nicholson, and their three children. I hope she enjoys every well-deserved time with them. I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in congratulating Sarah Nicholson on her retirement and thanking her for her work on behalf of Kentucky.

finest broadcast journalists, Scott Rey-nolds, will be signing off the air at Wave 3 News for the last time. For more than 20 years, Scott has brought his passion for Louisville and commit-ment to professionalism to our local NBC affiliate. Along the way, he has won awards, built friendships, and earned the respect of his viewers. As he prepares to leave Wave 3, I would like to take a moment to honor his career of accomplishment in Kentucky. Scott grew up on a dairy farm an hour outside of Minneapolis, MN. A fierce competitor, he loved playing baseball and watching the professionals on television. Later in his life, Scott would bring that same competitive na-ture to his work on the other side of the camera as a broadcaster. After graduating college, he moved to north-ern Idaho to work for a local radio sta-tion. Throughout his career, Scott has worked in several markets, including Cedar Rapids, IA, Las Vegas, NV, and eventually back near his home in Min-neapolis. It’s from there that Wave 3 convinced Scott to accept a new adventure in Louisville in 1996. He was ready for the intense market, even describing a con-stant ‘‘news war’’ in local television. He is clearly thriving in the competi-tion. Now the anchor of the 5, 6, and 11 pm newscasts, Scott was even recog-nized among his peers in 2016 winning an Emmy. Although he has earned his seat be-hind the anchor’s desk, that doesn’t mean Scott necessary stays there. In fact, I have heard some of his favorite segments have come from the field, in-cluding his coverage of the U.S. Su-preme Court’s Bush v. Gore decision in 2000 and his trip to the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. I have enjoyed the many times have gotten to speak with Scott about my work in the U.S. Senate. Discussing a broad range of topics important to Kentuckians throughout the years, I am grateful for his balanced demeanor and commitment to integrity. Every time he interviewed me, it was clear I was talking to one of the best in the business. Although broadcast journalism is a fast-paced, time-consuming job, Scott still finds time for his many hobbies, including charity work with the Juve-nile Diabetes Research Foundation and the American Red Cross. The rest of his time is devoted to his wife and five children: Haley, Connor, Tyler, and twins Matthew and Logan. I would like to extend my warmest wishes to Scott with gratitude for his work at Wave 3 News. I know his drive and talent will be missed. I would like to ask my Sen-ate colleague to join me in congratu-lating Scott Reynolds on a job well done.

REMEMBERING JOHN ANDREW RICKETT Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, today I wish to remember the life of John Andrew Rickett of Wayne Coun-ty, KY, who passed away earlier this year at the age of 94. As a proud mem-ber of the ‘‘greatest generation,’’ J.A. served in the U.S. Army Air Corps dur-ing World War II before returning to service again to fight in the Korean war. J.A. was a leader in his commu-nity, providing guidance to all those around him, and he will be remembered by many. Born and raised in Wofford, J.A. in-terrupted his high school studies and was drafted into the Army Air Corps. Arriving in England 1 month prior to D-Day, J.A. flew as a B17 waist gunner on several missions over Europe. His service played an important role in helping the Allies win the war. After his service in the Second World War, J.A. met the love of his life, Frieda. He dedicated the next 64 years to the service and love of his wife and their children. J.A. earned his bach-elor’s degree in agriculture from the University of Kentucky, where he was also active in the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps, ROTC. Upon grad-uating, he received a commission into the Army as a lieutenant and was drafted once again and sent to Korea. When he returned, J.A. began work-ing for the UK Extension Service, ini-tially as an agriculture agent but later as a 4H Agent in Monticello. His family remembers that it was with the 4H that he found great joy. Because of his many years of work with the 4H, J.A. is known for his care and respect for sev-eral generations of youth in Wayne County. Elaine and I send our condolences to his children, Cassandra, Jerry, Re-becca, and John, and their friends. I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in remembering the life of a great man, J.A. Rickett. f 
TRIBUTE TO TOMMY WILLETT Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, after leading the Monroe County gov-ernment for nearly a decade, my friend County judge-executive Tommy Willett will retire at the end of his term. I would like to take a moment to con-gratulate him on his accomplishments during his time in office and to thank him for his leadership. In 2011, Tommy answered the call of public service, stepping away from his successful business career to run for of-fice. The job isn’t an easy one. Speak-ing as a former judge-executive myself, I know firsthand the broad range of re-sponsibilities that fall into the job de-scription. But whatever the challenge, Tommy always worked to better the lives of the men and women of Monroe County. I would like to mention one par-ticular project I had the privilege to work on with Tommy. More than a dec-ade ago, the community began dis-cussing plans to construct its own water treatment facility. At that time, the county was purchasing water from the city of Tompkinsville, eventually reaching a high cost of nearly $80,000 per month. When county officials brought the idea to my attention, I stepped in to help. In addition to funds raised by the community and at the State level, I directed Federal re-sources to the project to help complete it. Working together with Tommy for a number of years, I was delighted to see the facility become fully functional earlier this year, with the capacity to pump 2 million gallons of water per day. The Monroe County Water District’s treatment plant is just one example of Tommy’s lasting impact on behalf of his constituents. With a constant drive to help Kentuckians however possible, he should be proud of his time in office. As he ends his public service, I extend my warm wishes for a restful retire-ment. Whatever the future may hold for Tommy, I hope he enjoys more time with his sons, Scott and James, and his four grandchildren, I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in congratulating Judge-Executive Tommy Willett for his public service in Kentucky. Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter from 44 former U.S. Senators be print-ed in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD . There being no objection, the mate-rial was ordered to be printed in the R
ECORD , as follows: 
DECEMBER 10, 2018. D
EAR SENATE COLLEAGUES : As former members of the U.S. Senate, Democrats and Republicans, it is our shared view that we are entering a dangerous period, and we feel an obligation to speak up about serious chal-lenges to the rule of law, the Constitution, our governing institutions and our national security. We are on the eve of the conclusion of spe-cial counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s inves-tigation and the House’s commencement of investigations of the president and his ad-ministration. The likely convergence of these two events will occur at a time when simmering regional conflicts and global power confrontations continue to threaten our security, economy and geopolitical sta-bility. It is a time, like other critical junctures in our history, when our nation must engage at every level with strategic precision and the hand of both the president and the Senate. We are at an inflection point in which the foundational principles of our democracy and our national security interests are at stake, and the rule of law and the ability of our institutions to function freely and inde-pendently must be upheld. During our service in the Senate, at times we were allies and at other times opponents, but never enemies. We all took an oath swearing allegiance to the Constitution. Whatever united or divided us, we did not veer from our unwavering and shared com-mitment to placing our country, democracy and national interest above all else. At other critical moments in our history, when constitutional crises have threatened our foundations, it has been the Senate that has stood in defense of our democracy. Today is once again such a time. Regardless of party affiliation, ideological leanings or geography, as former members of this great body, we urge current and future Senators to be steadfast and zealous guard-ians of our democracy by ensuring that par-tisanship or self-interest not replace na-tional interest.

TRIBUTE TO JANAN EVANS- WILENT Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Ms. Janan Evans- Wilent, a Knauss Sea Grant fellow on the U.S. Senate Committee on Com-merce, Science, and Transportation, for all of the hard work she has done for me, my staff, and other members of the committee over the past year. Ms. Evans-Wilent has leveraged her scientific expertise to inform public policy, having worked on several pieces of legislation that have passed the Sen-ate and several others being considered by the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. Her con-tributions have helped ensure the prop-er management of our natural re-sources and the continued protection and prosperity of our Nation. Her con-tributions will help improve drought monitoring for farmers and improved coastal management across the Nation. I would like to extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to Ms. Evans- Wilent for all of the fine work she has done. I wish her continued success in her new career at the Federal Emer-gency Management Agency in the years to come.

TRIBUTE TO SENIOR MASTER SERGEANT MEGAN PARROTT Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize and highlight the significant contributions of Megan Parrott, my 2018 Air Force fellow. SMSgt Megan Parrott began her fel-lowship in my office in January and immediately became an invaluable member of my staff. Her work as a part of my national security team has been beneficial in the efforts of my office to advocate and improve life for service-members, veterans, and Arkansans. Megan was born in Longbranch, NJ, and enlisted in the Air Force in 1999. In her 19-year military career, both on Active Duty and in the Reserves, Megan has excelled in her work. A ca-reer maintainer, Megan has served as a lead technician, flying crew chief, sec-tion chief, and flight line production superintendent. As a testament to her capabilities, in February 2012, Megan was selected for a position on the joint staff, working for the Senior Enlisted Advisor to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In that position she was the program manager and confidential adviser on matters including joining forces, the Women in Service Review, the Yellow Ribbon Program, and per-sonnel readiness. She has used her extensive experi-ence in the Air Force and the joint staff to help me serve Arkansans. Throughout her tenure on my staff, Megan demonstrated the Air Force core values of ‘‘Integrity First, Service Before Self, and Excellence In All We Do.’’ I relied upon Megan’s input on all matters of defense and veterans’ pol-icy. Megan drafted legislation, rec-ommended policy positions, staffed me at Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee hearings, represented me in meetings, and helped support my priorities dur-ing the appropriations process. She also assisted me in my role as a cochair of the Senate Air Force Caucus. Megan supported multiple congressional dele-gation trips to Air Force bases and co-ordinated meetings between Senators, the Secretary of the Air Force, and the Chief of Staff of the Air Force. Megan was well versed in the subject matter and fully steeped in research, and she always supplemented her knowledge with insights from her per-sonal experience as a senior enlisted leader in the military. In true senior NCO fashion, Megan made time during her year as a fellow to mentor junior members of my staff, providing career advice, offering information about ex-ecutive branch functions, and talking about professional development oppor-tunities. As the son of an Air Force master sergeant, I am especially proud to have hosted an enlisted fellow this year. I am only surprised that Megan is not yet a chief master sergeant, and I look forward to attending her promotion to chief in the very near future. Megan, thank you for all you have done for Arkansas while working on my staff. To her husband Chris—also an Air Force senior enlisted leader— and their two daughters, Natalie and Emily, I say thank you for sharing your amazing wife and mother with my team this year.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO KYLE WILSON AND ANTHONY BYRNS ∑Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, this week I have the honor of recognizing two outstanding Montanan men. Kyle Wilson of Richland County and An-thony Byrns of Sanders County for their dedicated service to this country. Kyle Wilson was born and raised in Sidney, MT. A lifelong Montanan who graduated from Sidney High School in 2011. Kyle, dedicated his life to public service, by joining the U.S. Navy. Hard working and disciplined are a few of the words used to describe those who join the, Armed Forces, and Kyle is the epitome of a hard working seaman. Anthony Byrns, Montana native, from Hot Springs truly grew up know-ing the meaning of small town. Fol-lowing the footsteps of many in his family, Anthony joined the U.S. Navy directly following his graduation from Hot Springs High School in 2015. An-thony has been a dedicated leader, tak-ing initiative of the opportunities set before him. Proud of his small town heritage, he is honored to represent Montanans. Kyle Wilson and Anthony Byrns are a part of just 1 percent of the Navy who were chosen to be in the Navy Ceremo-nial Guard. Upon selection they both went through Ceremonial Guard School, an 8-week program where they learn the protocol for important mili-tary ceremonies such as funerals. With the passing the late President H.W. Bush, both Wilson and Byrns were se-lected to carry his casket during the state ceremony, an honor of a life time. I commend both Kyle and Anthony for their diligent service to this coun-try and congratulate them for rep-resenting Montana with honor and pride. I look forward to seeing their fu-ture success as they continue to make all Montanans proud.∑ f 
TRIBUTE TO DAVE BUSIEK ∑Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to pay tribute to an Iowan whose stewardship at a leading tele-vision news station in Des Moines, IA, has strengthened the principles of good government, transparency and the public’s right to know. As a member of the broadcast press corps for four decades, Dave Busiek un-derstands that freedom of the press is fundamental to liberty in this country. I often say that journalists serve an important role in our system of checks and balances, which preserves liberty. They are integral to keeping an en-gaged and infoimed citizenry. They re-port corruption, weed out wrongdoing, and hold government accountable to the American people. Throughout my public service and political life, I hold myself accountable to Iowans by making myself accessible to members of the media. I hold reg-ular news conferences and answer their questions in the hallways of the U.S. Capitol and after my county meetings at home in Iowa. It is a commitment I have kept since my first campaign for the U.S. Senate back in 1980. And that happens to be the year my political path crossed with Dave Busiek. In fact, for as long as I have served Iowans in the U.S. Senate, Dave Busiek has served the people of Iowa in broadcast journalism: as a re-porter, anchor, and news director at

KCCI-TV in Des Moines, where he started in 1979 after working for 3 years at WHO Radio. Dave has led coverage of breaking news events, natural disasters, govern-ment and politics, and human interest stories that keep Iowans informed. When there has been a story to tell and information that matters to Iowans, Dave has led the coverage over the span of four decades. Twenty-nine years ago, he covered the United Flight 232 plane crash in Sioux City. He made sure Iowans knew what they needed to know during the historic floods of 1993 and during the tornadoes in Marshalltown, Pella, and surrounding communities this past summer. With fairness, accuracy and objectivity, Dave has led a team of journalists to report the news that affects the lives of Iowans, including decades of coverage of one my favorite places in Iowa: The Iowa State Fair. Of course, Iowa is considered ground zero for the presidential campaign trail and all things politics. Dave’s political coverage extends to six Iowa Governors and dates back to George H.W. Bush beating Ronald Reagan in the 1980 cau-cuses. As I mentioned earlier, he cov-ered my first Senate campaign in 1980 and 35 years later, partnered with CBS News and the Des Moines Register to cosponsor the Democratic Debate for President at Drake University. His 29-year tenure as news director at KCCI helped the station win countless awards for journalistic excellence. In 2002, he was elected chair of the Radio- Television News-Directors Association and was named News Director of the Year in 2014 by Broadcasting and Cable Magazine. He was inducted this sum-mer into the Iowa Broadcasters Asso-ciation Hall of Fame. He understands that good content is integral to sur-vival from an economic standpoint and obviously, good content matters to good government and quality jour-nalism. He pursued KCCI’s expansion into social media where the news sta-tion provides weather and breaking news coverage across all digital plat-forms to its consumers. Whether on-air or online, Dave has worked to stay on top of the news, day after day, for four decades. Dave Busiek is not a native Iowan, but we sure are glad he has called Iowa home since graduating from the Mis-souri School of Journalism. Remark-ably, he is only the third news director at KCCI since it first aired in 1955. From viewers to voters, I know that Iowans carry a high bar of expecta-tions. Dave earned his rise through the ranks and certainly has raised the bar even higher for his peers in the profes-sion. I would like to thank Dave Busiek for his service, professionalism and in-tegrity in broadcast journalis also like to thank him for his testimony at a congressional hearing I led back in 2000. He testified in support of my bi-partisan legislation to allow cameras in Federal courtrooms. The Supreme Court has affirmed that the public has a right to know what happens in our courts. Dave and I agree that the media can serve as an important surro-gate to allow the court of public opin-ion to bear witness to the court of law through the unfiltered lens of a cam-era. Specifically, audio/visual stream-ing and broadcasting of the Federal courts would enhance better apprecia-tion and understanding of the Federal judiciary, a coequal branch of the Fed-eral Governnent. That was 18 years ago. And I am not giving up on getting this bill signed into law. They say slow and steady wins the race. The people of Iowa graciously put me on this fence post and I am committed to fighting the fight as long as I am serving in the U.S. Senate. I congratulate Dave Busiek on a re-markable career. His legacy will con-tinue to shine long after he signs off as news director through the lens of countless journalists he has trained and mentored along the way. ∑

RECOGNIZING SCHILLING BEER CO. ∑Ms. HASSAN. Mr. President, last month, as fires raged across northern California, a New Hampshire family business stepped up to help. For their efforts, I am proud to recognize Dr. Bruce Cozzens, his sons Jeff, Stuart, and Matt; long-time friend John Lenzini, as well as head brewer Chris Deapo of Schilling Beer Co. as Decem-ber 2018’s Granite Staters of the Month. Schilling Beer Co. was founded in 2013 by friends and family who are deeply committed to their community, and one of their core values as a busi-ness is looking out for others. As CEO Jeff Cozzens put it, ‘‘part of living this value means that we help others when-ever it is within our power do so.’’ As the Camp Fire blazed, Schilling Beer Co. agreed to be part of a national ‘‘Resilience’’ fundraiser spearheaded by Sierra Nevada Brewing. As part of the initiative, Schilling Beer Co. will join breweries across the country to help brew the Resilience Butte Country Proud IPA, of which all of the proceeds will go to relief efforts in Butte Coun-ty, CA. Schilling Beer Co. also played an important role by lending their trademarked name of ‘‘Resilience,’’ their American ale project, to the cause. In Jeff’s words, ‘‘Butte County resi-dents have suffered a tragedy of un-speakable proportions,’’ and the brew-ery was honored to be able to play a role in assisting them. I am extremely grateful for their generosity and efforts to help the vic-tims of the California wildfires, and I am proud to recognize the Cozzens and Lenzini families of Schilling Beer Co., as well as head brewer Chris Deapo, as the December Granite Staters of the Month.∑

TON) submitted the following resolu-tion; which was referred to the Com-mittee on Foreign Relations: 
S. R ES. 732 Whereas, until 1967, Syria controlled the Golan Heights and used the topographical advantage it provided to attack Israeli troops and civilians; Whereas, in June 1967, Syria intensified its attacks against Israel from the Golan Heights, and Israel captured the Golan Heights in a defensive war; Whereas, in October 1973, the Golan Heights provided Israel with critical stra-tegic depth to repel a surprise attack by Syr-ian forces; Whereas, on September 1, 1975, President Gerald Ford provided a diplomatic assurance to Israel that ‘‘the U.S. will support the posi-tion that an overall settlement with Syria in the framework of a peace agreement must assure Israel’s security from attack from the Golan Heights’’ and that ‘‘the U.S. has not developed a final position on the borders. Should it do so it will give great weight to Israel’s position that any peace agreement with Syria must be predicated on Israel re-maining on the Golan Heights’’; Whereas, in October 1991, Secretary of State James Baker provided a diplomatic as-surance to Israel that ‘‘the United States continues to stand behind the assurance given by President Ford to Prime Minister Rabin on September 1, 1975’’; Whereas, in 1981, Israel applied its ‘‘law, ju-risdiction, and administration’’ over the Golan Heights and has controlled the Golan Heights for 51 years; Whereas, since 2011, Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has killed hundreds of thousands of Syrian civilians, including with weapons of mass destruction, and has pursued an ethnic cleansing campaign against Syrian Sunnis; Whereas Iran has used the war in Syria to establish a military presence in the Levant, including thousands of Iranian troops and proxies, and now seeks to create territorial corridors that solidify its control, expand its activities, establish a permanent military presence, and provide arms to its terrorist proxies; Whereas Iran is the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism and the leaders of Iran regularly threaten to wipe out Israel; Whereas Iran and its proxies have repeat-edly attacked Israel from inside Syria, in-cluding in February 2018 when Iranian forces infiltrated Israel with a drone and in May 2018 when Iranian forces shelled the Golan Heights; Whereas, in December 2014, Congress unanimously resolved that the United States supported the sovereign right of the Govern-ment of Israel to defend its territory and its citizens from attacks against Israel by Hamas, a terrorist group supported by Iran; and Whereas Israel’s control over the Golan Heights provides a defensible border, deters attacks from hostile forces, facilitates intel-ligence gathering, and allows Israel to detect threats to its national security: Now, there-fore, be it Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that—

At the end, add the following: TITLE VII—DEMOCRACY RESTORATION ACT 
SEC. 701. SHORT TITLE. 
This title may be cited as the ‘‘Democracy Restoration Act of 2018’’. 
SEC. 702. FINDINGS. 
Congress makes the following findings: (1) The right to vote is the most basic con-stitutive act of citizenship. Regaining the right to vote reintegrates individuals with criminal convictions into free society, help-ing to enhance public safety. (2) Article I, section 4, of the Constitution grants Congress ultimate supervisory power over Federal elections, an authority which has repeatedly been upheld by the United States Supreme Court. (3) Basic constitutional principles of fair-ness and equal protection require an equal opportunity for citizens of the United States to vote in Federal elections. The right to vote may not be abridged or denied by the United States or by any State on account of race, color, gender, or previous condition of servitude. The 13th, 14th, 15th, 19th, 24th, and 26th Amendments to the Constitution em-power Congress to enact measures to protect the right to vote in Federal elections. The 8th Amendment to the Constitution provides for no excessive bail to be required, nor ex-cessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted. (4) There are 3 areas where discrepancies in State laws regarding criminal convictions lead to unfairness in Federal elections— (A) the lack of a uniform standard for vot-ing in Federal elections leads to an unfair disparity and unequal participation in Fed-eral elections based solely on where a person lives; (B) laws governing the restoration of vot-ing rights after a criminal conviction vary throughout the country and persons in some States can easily regain their voting rights while in other States persons effectively lose their right to vote permanently; and (C) State disenfranchisement laws dis-proportionately impact racial and ethnic mi-norities. (5) Two States do not disenfranchise indi-viduals with criminal convictions at all (Maine and Vermont), but 48 States and the District of Columbia have laws that deny convicted individuals the right to vote while they are in prison. (6) In some States disenfranchisement re-sults from varying State laws that restrict voting while individuals are under the super-vision of the criminal justice system or after they have completed a criminal sentence. In 34 States, convicted individuals may not vote while they are on parole and 30 of those

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S7671 December 17, 2018 
States disenfranchise individuals on felony probation as well. In 10 States, a conviction can result in lifetime disenfranchisement. (7) Several States deny the right to vote to individuals convicted of certain mis-demeanors. (8) An estimated 6,100,000 citizens of the United States, or about 1 in 40 adults in the United States, currently cannot vote as a re-sult of a felony conviction. Of the 6,100,000 citizens barred from voting, only approxi-mately 22 percent are in prison. By contrast, roughly 77 percent of the disenfranchised re-side in their communities while on probation or parole or after having completed their sentences. Approximately 3,100,000 citizens who have completed their sentences remain disenfranchised due to restrictive State laws. In six States—Alabama, Florida, Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Virginia—more than 7 percent of the total population is disenfranchised. (9) In those States that disenfranchise indi-viduals post-sentence, the right to vote can be regained in theory, but in practice this possibility is often granted in a non-uniform and potentially discriminatory manner. Disenfranchised individuals must either ob-tain a pardon or an order from the Governor or an action by the parole or pardon board, depending on the offense and State. Individ-uals convicted of a Federal offense often have additional barriers to regaining voting rights. (10) State disenfranchisement laws dis-proportionately impact racial and ethnic mi-norities. More than 7 percent of the voting- age African-American population, or 2,200,000 African-Americans, are disenfranchised. Cur-rently, 1 of every 13 African-Americans are rendered unable to vote because of felony disenfranchisement, which is a rate more than 4 times greater than non-African-Amer-icans. 7.4 percent of African-Americans are disenfranchised whereas only 1.8 percent of non-African-Americans are. As of 2016, in 4 States—Florida (23 percent), Kentucky (22 percent), Tennessee (21 percent), and Vir-ginia (20 percent)—more than 1 in 5 African- Americans were unable to vote because of prior convictions. (11) Latino citizens are disproportionately disenfranchised based upon their dispropor-tionate representation in the criminal jus-tice system. If current incarceration trends hold, 17 percent of Latino men will be incar-cerated during their lifetimes, in contrast to less than 6 percent of non-Latino White men. When analyzing the data across 10 States, Latinos generally have disproportionately higher rates of disenfranchisement compared to their presence in the voting age popu-lation. In 6 out of 10 States studied in 2003, Latinos constitute more than 10 percent of the total number of persons disenfranchised by State felony laws. In 4 States (California, 37 percent; New York, 34 percent; Texas, 30 percent; and Arizona, 27 percent), Latinos were disenfranchised by a rate of more than 25 percent. (12) Disenfranchising citizens who have been convicted of a criminal offense and who are living and working in the community serves no compelling State interest and hinders their rehabilitation and reintegra-tion into society. (13) State disenfranchisement laws can suppress electoral participation among eligi-ble voters by discouraging voting among family and community members of disenfranchised persons. Future electoral participation by the children of disenfranchised parents may be impacted as well. (14) The United States is the only Western democracy that permits the permanent de-nial of voting rights for individuals with fel-ony convictions. SEC. 703. RIGHTS OF CITIZENS. 
The right of an individual who is a citizen of the United States to vote in any election for Federal office shall not be denied or abridged because that individual has been convicted of a criminal offense unless such individual is serving a felony sentence in a correctional institution or facility at the time of the election.

TRIBUTE TO THOMAS G. HUNGAR 
HON. PAUL D. RYAN 
OF WISCONSIN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, December 17, 2018 Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express the appreciation of the entire House of Representatives to Thomas G. Hungar for his exemplary service as General Counsel of the House. Tom has been a faith-ful defender of this institution, its Members, and its prerogatives since his appointment in 2016. Tom’s distinguished legal career has in-cluded service in all three branches of govern-ment. In the Judicial Branch, he served as a law clerk in the United States Court of Ap-peals for the Ninth Circuit and the Supreme Court of the United States. In the Executive Branch, he served in the Office of the Solicitor General at the Department of Justice, includ-ing as Deputy Solicitor General. Having pre-sented oral argument before the Supreme Court in 26 cases, Tom is one of our Nation’s leading appellate lawyers and an expert on constitutional law. Tom began his Legislative Branch service with the House in 2016, as one of only a small number of lawyers ever to serve as General Counsel of the House. Under Tom’s guidance and leadership, the General Counsel’s Office has provided sophisticated and invaluable legal advice and has been a trusted institu-tional resource for Members, Officers, Com-mittees, and staff, regardless of political affili-ation. Through excellent legal work and coun-sel, undertaken with zeal for the best interests of the House, Tom and his office have earned the respect of Members on both sides of the aisle. When the House’s institutional interests were at stake, Tom’s legal advice was always tailored to safeguarding the House’s constitu-tional prerogatives and protecting the House’ s vital role in our constitutional structure. Tom successfully litigated cases defending and pro-tecting the House’s constitutionally based sub-poena authority. Tom also defended the House and its Officers to preserve and protect the House’s longstanding practice of opening each legislative day with a prayer. Additionally, under Tom, the House has filed amicus briefs articulating its position on the proper interpre-tation of the Appropriations, Rulemaking, and Speech or Debate Clauses of the Constitution. Numerous Members, Committees, and Sub-committees relied on Tom’s extensive litigation expertise in connection with investigative and oversight activities. Finally, Tom defended House Members, Officers, and staff in judicial proceedings at both the trial and appellate lev-els and advised Members and Committees in connection with their interactions with both pri-vate and other governmental entities. I know that Tom will continue his excep-tional work wherever the next chapter of his impressive legal career takes him. On behalf of the House of Representatives, I express my deepest gratitude to Tom for his dedication to this institution, and I extend our very best wishes to him, his wife Jaye, and their chil-dren, Brett, Claire, Lance, and Paige.

HONORING THE LIFE OF DAKARAI FAGORALA 
HON. JERRY McNERNEY 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, December 17, 2018 Mr. M
CNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, I ask my col-leagues to join me in honoring the life of Dakarai Fagorala, who passed away on Sun-day, August 12, 2018. Dakarai was only 17 years old and just shy of his 18th birthday when he passed as a result of injuries sus-tained from a fatal car accident. Dakarai recently graduated with honors from Deer Valley High School in Antioch, California, where he also played on the basketball team. He was an exceptional young man, working a part-time job to save money for college and help his family during his school years. He participated in the 2016 National Youth Leadership Forum for National Security-Diplo-macy and competed in the 2016 Amateur Ath-letic Union’s ‘‘Jam on It’’ Tournament. Dakarai took great pride in his community and looked for ways to give back. He was a Junior Deacon at Fellowship Church in Anti-och and regularly volunteered at homeless shelters in Contra Costa County, cooking and serving meals to veterans and seniors. Dakarai was a shining light who touched the lives of everyone he met. Our community mourns the loss of Dakarai Fagorala, and our thoughts and prayers are with his family.

For more than seven years, she has worked in my congressional office as part of the constituent services team and handled the issues of military and Veterans affairs and aerospace. Her time as a Lieutenant Colonel in the Air Force brought a wealth of knowl-edge on Veteran’s issues and a shared expe-rience she that she was able to relate to with the Veterans she helped. She has been a tre-mendous asset to our team and to the con-stituents we serve. Her relationships with liai-sons at federal agencies and within the com-munity helped ensure she was always able to help answer questions, direct folks to the ap-propriate resources, secure long-deserved medals and recognition for Veterans, and even secure money or benefits that were owed to Veterans in the district. Prior to serving in my congressional office, Kathryn worked on behalf of Veterans across the state in the Colorado Department of Vet-erans Affairs. Prior to that, she served in the United States Air Force for 27 years, retiring as a Lieutenant Colonel. Her dedication, par-ticularly to women Veterans, is commendable and is shown through her work in forming the Colorado Women’s Veterans organization, which she is the current Vice President. Kathryn has a true gift for working with Vet-erans and understanding the issues and chal-lenges they face. Her good nature and sense of humor always help make Veterans and con-stituents feel comfortable and welcome. I ex-tend my deepest appreciation to Kathryn Wirkus for the difference she made in the lives of many people in our community and for her service to our country. I will be forever grateful for her service to our team, the district, and the United States of America. I wish her all the best in her next chapter.

RECOGNIZING THE BRAVERY OF DARRYL TRAPPS 
HON. JOHN KATKO 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, December 17, 2018 Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Syracuse firefighter Darryl Trapps, who serves as an emergency re-sponder at the Carrier Dome during Syracuse University basketball games. During the De-cember 4th game against Northeastern Uni-versity, Mr. Trapps performed CPR on a pa-tron suffering from a medical emergency. The actions of Mr. Trapps and others in attend-ance saved the man’s life. Since 2004, Mr. Trapps has worked as an emergency responder at the Carrier Dome. Mr. Trapps diligently monitors athletic events for emergencies and, before December 4th, no serious incidents had occurred during his tenure. However, before the December 4th game, a patron went stiff in his seat and began suffering a cardiac event. Mr. Trapps recognized the severity of the situation and jumped into action. Mr. Trapps arrived to the man’s section and, upon discovering the man had no pulse, began performing chest compressions. Mr. Trapps was surrounded by concerned attendees but his emergency response skills and training allowed him to block out any sort of distraction. He administered chest compres-sions while a doctor performed rescue breath-ing, both of them trying to keep oxygen flow-ing to the patient’s brain. Emergency Medical Technicians arrived with a defibrillator shortly after Mr. Trapps began assisting the man. They administered two shocks to the man’s chest with Mr. Trapps continuing chest compressions between the shocks. On the third shock, the man’s pulse returned and he was taken to Upstate Univer-sity Hospital for further treatment. Mr. Trapps had successfully saved the man’s life but im-mediately returned to his duty. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the House to join me in honoring the courageous actions of Darryl Trapps. His composure dur-ing this chaotic situation was no easy task and his efforts saved the life of another individual. I applaud Mr. Trapps, as well as first respond-ers around the country, whose daily actions save countless lives.

IN RECOGNITION OF WALTER R. BROOKS, JR. 
HON. WILLIAM R. KEATING 
OF MASSACHUSETTS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, December 17, 2018 Mr. KEATING. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the life of Walter R. Brooks, Jr., founder of Cape Cod Today, who passed away at the age of eighty-seven. Mr. Brooks has been a pillar of the commu-nity, serving as a voice for Cape Cod. Born in 1930 to Walter Rollin Brooks, Sr. and Evelyn Mae Brooks, he was raised as an only child in Woodbury, Connecticut. At an early age, he knew he wanted to follow in his father’s foot-steps and pursue a career in journalism. Fol-lowing his graduation from the University of Connecticut, Mr. Brooks went on to serve as a publisher, managing editor, promotion and marketing director for the Village Voice, the New York Post, the Greenwich CT Times, the Naugatuck Daily News, the Amherst MA Jour-nal-Record, the Enfield CT Press, the Cape Codder, and MPG Communications. In 1959, Mr. Brooks spent a summer in Provincetown, where he met and married the love of his life, Patricia. Their love of Cape Cod would lead them to settle in Harwich in 1965, where they raised their two sons, Todd and Jay. After moving, Walter and Patricia, who were devoted to improving the accessi-bility of news outlets, launched a Cape Cod tourism publication entitled Best Read Guides. In 1998, his passion for his community led him to establish, Cape Cod Today. One of the na-tion’s first online-only local news websites, Cape Cod Today has been an integral part of the Commonwealth. Mr. Brooks has always put the people of Cape Cod first, constantly trying to figure out how to better his home. He has stepped up at every point to improve our schools and our community by using his newspaper to hold in-stitutions and individuals accountable to the people. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to honor the life of Walter R. Brooks, Jr. for his dedication to bettering our community. I ask that my col-leagues join me in recognizing his commit-ment to journalism and the people of Cape Cod. RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE OF TOM TORLAKSON HON. MARK DeSAULNIER 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, December 17, 2018 Mr. D
ESAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with Congressman M
IKETHOMPSON to recog- nize Tom Torlakson for his dedicated and pas-sionate service to our community. A recipient of the Merchant Marine Service Medal, Tom began his life-long commitment to service as a fireman in assignments such as Guam, Vietnam, and Thailand. After his serv-ice, Tom attended the University of California Berkeley, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts in History, a Life Secondary Teaching Creden-tial, and a Master of Arts in Education. Tom has served as a teacher for the Mount Diablo Unified School District, a councilman for the City of Antioch, a county supervisor for Contra Costa County, and as a legislator in both the California State Senate and State As-sembly. During his tenure in the California State Legislature, Tom fought to increase funding for education, implement school nutri-tion programs and physical education, and im-prove school safety. He also led the charge for making the California public school system more inclusive by eliminating the achievement gap, reducing the dropout rate, and funding afterschool programs. As the State Superintendent of Public In-struction, Tom brought his experience and drive to the California Department of Edu-cation where he continued his vow to improve our state’s public education system. During his two terms, Tom set new standards for testing student achievement, expanded programs that meet the needs of children outside of the reg-ular school day, and oversaw a record high school graduation rate. Tom is also the chair and founder of the California Task Force on Youth and Workplace Wellness, where he has continued to promote healthier meals and physical activity for students. Tom Torlakson has left a positive impact on the California public school system and its stu-dents, and the community at large. While his leadership and enthusiasm will be dearly missed in his official capacity, he will surely continue to contribute to California. I join with Congressman M
IKE THOMPSON in thanking Tom for his service to our County, our state, and our students, and wish him the best in his retirement.

HONORING BLAKE KINNETT 
HON. JOHN SHIMKUS 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, December 17, 2018 Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Blake James Dale Kinnett of Alvin, Illi-nois. Blake is the son of John and Becky and brother to Kaitlyn and Garet. He is passionate about sports, especially baseball and basket-ball. By the age of 12, Blake was a two-time baseball state champion, and even played in a national tournament in Cooperstown, New York with the Illiana Chiefs. Blake also enjoyed playing basketball in Alvin, where a court has been renamed in his honor. When Blake wasn’t playing sports, he enjoyed spending time with his friends and family as well as fishing and turkey hunting. In 2017, Blake was diagnosed with Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD), a disease that destroys the protective myelin sheath sur-rounding the brain’s neurons. ALD affects 1 in 18,000 people, and to date there is no known cure. After Blake’s diagnosis, his community ral-lied around him and his family to sponsor fundraisers and help spread awareness about ALD. Blake, his family, and his community’s efforts to spread awareness of this disease helped affect change in Illinois state law and led to the designation of December 1st as ‘‘Blake Kinnett Day’’. Mr. Speaker, I wish to commend Blake for his resilience in facing his ALD diagnosis. Blake is an inspiration to everyone who hears his story. May God bless him and his family. f 
CELEBRATING NEW YORK FARM-ERS AND THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS TO ‘‘HARVEST FOR ALL’’ 
HON. JOHN KATKO 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, December 17, 2018 Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the farmers in my district, alongside the New York Farm Bureau, for their participa-tion in the ‘‘Harvest For All’’ program. ‘‘Harvest For All’’ is a nationwide program that seeks to distribute food to needy families and individ-uals. Run by farm bureaus and food banks across the country, the program has been as-sisting underserved communities for nearly two decades. ‘‘Harvest For All’’ was started in 2002 by members of the Farm Bureau’s Young Farm-ers & Ranchers program but now includes vol-unteers of all ages. The program operates year round and has donated nearly 223 million pounds of food, as well as amassed over 121,000 volunteer hours since it began. Be-tween monetary and food contributions, ‘‘Har-vest For All’’ donates an amount equivalent to 31 million meals. In New York State, ‘‘Harvest For All’’ has a strong presence and reaches many New York-ers in need. In 2016, the New York Farm Bu-reau donated 13.2 million pounds of food, the second largest total among state Farm Bu-reaus. They have donated 11 million pounds of food so far in 2018, an amount that trans-lates to 9,000,000 meals for underprivileged New Yorkers. In addition to food donations, the New York Farm Bureau is teaching New Yorkers the culinary knowledge necessary to prepare healthier foods. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the House to join me in recognizing the local farm-ers, New York Farm Bureau, and Farm Bu-reaus around the country, for their participa-tion in ‘‘Harvest For All.’’ During this time of year in particular, it is incredibly important we count our blessings and help those who are less fortunate. ‘‘Harvest For All’’ is a program that embodies this standard as farmers nation-wide strive to improve the quality of life for mil-lions in our great country. I thank the Central New York farmers who contribute to this pro-gram year after year and recognize their role in building a better New York.

TRIBUTE IN HONOR OF JAMES LEWIS 
HON. HAROLD ROGERS 
OF KENTUCKY  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, December 17, 2018 Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to one of Eastern Kentucky’s longest serving county clerks, Mr. James Lewis who was sworn into office as the Leslie County Clerk in January 1986. He is re-tiring after dedicating 33 years of public serv-ice to the people of Leslie County, including his oversight of nearly 60 elections. James has garnered the utmost respect of his peers and leaders across the Common-wealth of Kentucky for his astute knowledge, experience, and steadfast integrity in election operations. He has instructed election training for county clerks in Kentucky for more than 20 years, served as President of the Kentucky County Clerk’s Association from 1999 to 2000, and has been Chairman of the Kentucky County Clerk’s Association Election Com-mittee from 1994 until his retirement this year. James has served as a guardian for common-sense election reform since 1986 and a staunch advocate for programs and policies that best serve Kentuckians. During his tenure as county clerk, James has sought out opportunities to offer compas-sion and additional support to those most in need. In fact, he co-founded the Help A Vet-eran Everyday (HAVE) Program to provide funding for Veterans programs across the state. The HAVE program repurposes license plates for bird houses that can be purchased at participating County Clerk’s offices, offering 100 percent of proceeds to the Hope for Vet-erans charity. Aside from going above and beyond the call of duty in his role as Leslie County Clerk, James has been a loyal friend of the Repub-lican Party who proudly works to uphold the conservative principles that he holds dear. James has participated in every election since turning 18 years old, has dedicated his career to administering six dozen elections, and been a valiant pioneer for election reform. He has served as a tireless member of the Republican Parties of Leslie County and Kentucky for many years and was inducted into the Ken-tucky Fifth District Lincoln Club Hall of Fame in 2010. James’ leadership has been highly re-spected, reliable and resourceful for one of Kentucky’s most rural and impoverished coun-ties. He is a beloved friend to the people of Leslie County who has made a lasting impact through his devoted kindness and fortitude for a brighter future. I wish James and his wife, Betty, a retirement filled with joy and peace with their daughters, Danika and Wendy, and their grandchildren, Kelsey and R.J. May their gardening and fishing days together be fruitful. f

RECOGNIZING THE 136TH ANNIVER-SARY OF THE HOTEL ROANOKE & CONFERENCE CENTER 
HON. BOB GOODLATTE 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, December 17, 2018 Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I am happy to recognize a National Historic Landmark lo-cated in my hometown of Roanoke, Virginia in the Sixth Congressional District. The Hotel Ro-anoke & Conference Center stands at the heart of Roanoke’s downtown, on a hill in the Gainsboro neighborhood where it has been lo-cated for 136 years. Roanoke was founded as the confluence of two railroads. The Norfolk and Western Rail-way established the city as its hub. The N&W—now Norfolk Southern—constructed the Hotel Roanoke and opened it on Christmas Day 1882. Since then, it has welcomed men, women, and children from all walks of life to enjoy the hotel’s lodging, its amenities—in-cluding its Southern cuisine, like its famous peanut soup—and just the chance to spend time in one of the city’s cultural centers. Regretfully, due to declining interest in maintaining the historic structure, the Hotel Roanoke closed on November 30, 1989. The contents of the hotel were even sold to inter-ested buyers. Fortunately, thanks to an agree-ment with Virginia Tech and the desire of community leaders to redevelop the dilapi-dated structure, more than 2,800 people and businesses pledged the funds needed to help the Renew Roanoke effort, which raised $8 million to save the hotel from demolition. In a partnership that included the Virginia Tech Real Estate Foundation and the City of Roanoke, the completely renovated Hotel Ro-anoke & Conference Center opened in April 1995. The city built a pedestrian bridge to con-nect the facility to the central business district, a vital connection that has contributed heavily to the rebirth of Roanoke’s downtown. It’s esti-mated in the 23 years since its reopening, the hotel and conference center has had a $558 million economic impact and has led to hun-dreds of millions of dollars in additional invest-ments by a wide variety of housing interests, businesses, restaurants, and cultural amen-ities. Affiliated as a Doubletree hotel from its re-opening, the Hotel Roanoke & Conference re-cently converted to Hilton’s Curio Collection. It’s the latest update to take the structure known for its Tudor-style construction into a new role in Roanoke’s growth. I’ve been blessed to enjoy countless happy occasions with family members and friends at ‘‘the Grand Old Lady on the Hill.’’ The Hotel Roanoke’s 136th anniversary is just a week away. It’s a fine time to celebrate not only the Christmas holidays but the contributions made by the Hotel Roanoke to the region’s history and its very promising future. f

PASSAGE OF H.R. 6964, THE JUVE-NILE JUSTICE REFORM ACT OF 2018 HON. ROBERT C. ‘‘BOBBY’’ SCOTT 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, December 17, 2018 Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, today is a great day for our nation’s youth and their communities. I would like to take a moment and reflect on the passage of H.R. 6964 as amended by the Senate, the Juvenile Justice Reform Act of 2018, a comprehensive reau-thorization of the Juvenile Justice and Delin-quency Prevention Act of 1974 (JJDPA), which is now headed to the President’s desk for his signature. Last authorized in 2002, JJDPA sets the federal guardrails that protect children in the custody of our state juvenile justice systems. JJDPA contains four core protections for youth in state juvenile justice systems: Jail Removal: Children in the system cannot be housed in the same facility as adult offend-ers, except under limited circumstances. Sight and Sound Separation: In the limited circumstances that children are housed in the same facility as adult offenders, they must have sight and sound separation. Deinstitutionalization of Status Offenders (DSO): Children who have committed status offenses—infractions based solely on their age (e.g., underage drinking, truancy—cannot be placed in secure detention, except under lim-ited circumstances. Disproportionate Minority Contact (DMC): State systems must detertmine if their system has disproportionate contact with minority of-fenders. These protections were created and refined over time through Congressional reauthoriza-tions that built upon the evidence-based best practices of states. I’m proud to say that H.R. 6964 makes strides to improve each of the four core protections. The bill improves the ‘Jail Removal’ and ‘Sight and Sound Separa-tion’ core protections by simplifying the defini-tion of contact and phasing in sight and sound separation for youth under the age of 18 being held pretrial in adult criminal court. It strengthens the DSO core protection by increasing the oversight required when a state uses one of the limited circumstances avail-able in the law—the valid court order (VCO)— to detain a status offender. And the bill refines the DMC core protection to ensure that states must collect and report data on decision points in the juvenile justice system to identify where disparities occur. This is a contravention of harmful proposals offered by the current Ad-ministrator of the federal Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP). While enactment of H.R. 6964 is a good first step, I join my House Republican colleagues who championed this bill in expressing regret that the legislation in its final form does not go far enough to improve the core protections. Specifically, I am disappointed that H.R. 6964 does not eliminate the VCO exception to DSO. The VCO exception was added to JJDPA in the 1980’s after a push by juvenile court judges. It is used by judges to detain repeat status offenders and juveniles who fail to ap-pear in court. But the research suggests that the VCO exception has not been effective as a means of reducing juvenile delinquency and

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD —Extensions of RemarksE1681 December 17, 2018 
has been responsible, in part, for the explo-sive growth of young girls in the juvenile jus-tice system. The use of the VCO exception has been phased out in about half of the states, and the National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges, who once advo-cated for its inclusion, have strongly lobbied for its removal. Both bipatiisan versions of this legislation previously passed by the full House would have required states to phase-out use of the VCO by September 30, 2020, with an allow-ance for states to apply for a hardship exten-sion through OJJDP. Due to the objection of just one Senator, this provision could not re-ceive unanimous consent in the Senate. Rath-er than stopping the other improvements in the bill from becoming law, this VCO phase- out was removed H.R. 6964. H.R. 6964, how-ever, will provide additional safeguards for sta-tus offenders in locked facilities, including lim-its on how long status offenders may be de-tained. I urge Congress to eliminate the VCO exception once and for all in subsequent legis-lation. JJDPA is more than just a floor of federal protection—it also requires states to develop coordinated plans to serve juvenile offenders and prevent children from ever becoming in-volved in delinquent activity. H.R. 6964 re-quires, for the first time, state juvenile justice plans to consider the latest scientific research on adolescent development and behavior, rec-ognizing the importance of prevention and early intervention in juvenile crime policy. Con-gress should not have to mandate consider-ation of evidence and research, but slogans and soundbites have unfortunately dictated our nation’s approach to crime policy—even juvenile crime. These slogans and soundbites often do nothing to decrease crime. In fact, when studied, many been shown to actually increase crime. H.R. 6964 also encourages states to con-sider promising practices: Programming to en-sure youth access to public defenders with ju-venile court experience; the use of ‘problem- solving courts’ as an alternative to probation and confinement; efforts to inform and aid ju-veniles in the process of sealing and expunging their juvenile record; and program-ming to address the needs of girls in or at risk of entering the system when developing state plans. And finally, the bill retools and retitles Title V of JJDPA, the Local Delinquency Prevention Grant program, as the Youth Promise Incen-tive Grants for Local Delinquency Prevention Program. Title V will now support communities in the planning and implementation of evi-dence-based prevention and intervention pro-grams specifically designed to reduce juvenile and delinquency and gang involvement. Grant recipients would be required to analyze the unmet delinquency prevention needs of youth in the community, then develop and implement a comprehensive strategy to address those unmet needs with an emphasis on program coordination. Research shows that a community-wide, co-ordinated approach to delinquency prevention that utilizes a continuum of services can actu-ally save the community money and improve efficiencies. I’d like to especially thank my col-leagues for working with me on the Title V provisions, which are modeled after a bill I’ve been working on for nearly ten years—The Youth P.R.O.M.I.S.E. Act. I am confident that, if implemented correctly, this incentive grant program will vastly improve the lives of—and long-term economic opportunity for—at-risk youth across the country. I look forward to working with OJJDP as it implements this new title. H.R. 6964 also includes a two-year reau-thorization of the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act (RHYA). RHYA was originally passed as part of JJDPA because this Con-gress recognized the importance of alter-natives to detention for youth who were not delinquent but had run away from home or foster care. While originally passed as a part of JJDPA in 1974, RHYA and JJDPA have always been administered separately, and they have been reauthorized separately since 1988. Like JJDPA, RHYA is long overdue for reauthoriza-tion, as it was last reauthorized in 2008. This temporary reauthorization of RHYA dem-onstrates our commitment to its programs, particularly considering last year’s groundbreaking research showing that home-lessness was experienced by at least 700,000 unaccompanied minors age 14 to 17 and 3.2 million young adults age 18 to 24 in any given year. I want to note that this two-year reauthoriza-tion does not serve as a substitute for a full examination of evidence-based best practices for service-delivery impacting runaway and homeless youth. We still need to pass a com-prehensive RHYA reauthorization that makes needed programmatic updates and ensures authorization for appropriate funding levels. I look forward to working with the Gentle-woman from North Carolina, Dr. F
OXXand my colleagues in this chamber who have long ad-vocated for a full reauthorization of RHYA, as well as advocates for runaway and homeless youth providers, to move a full reauthorization of RHYA in the next Congress. Prevention efforts, especially those targeted at our nation’s youth, are our most effective way of reducing crime over time. We can choose to be as strict or as lenient as we want on adult criminal offenders, but if we are not focusing our efforts on changing the trajectory of delinquent youth, we have little chance of reducing crime in the future. It is my sincere hope that H.R. 6964 will help to change the trajectory of many young people and get them on the track to succeeding in school and life, which will strengthen communities across the country. In closing, I’d like to thank Chairwoman F
OXX and Representative L EWIS of Minnesota and their staffs for their steadfast work over multiple Congresses to successfully advance JJDPA reauthorization through both chambers and to the President’s desk. I’d also like to thank my hardworking committee and personal office staff past and present, specifically Chris-tian Haines, Bobby Vassar, Erin Davies, Rashage Green, Carol Chodroff, Evan Chap-man, David Dailey, Veronique Pluviose, Ilana Bruner, and Jacque Chevalier Mosely for their tireless work on both the Youth P.R.O.M.I.S.E. Act and comprehensive JJDPA reauthoriza-tion. HONORING MS. PATRICIA W. MCDOWELL 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, December 17, 2018 Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speak-er, I rise today to honor Ms. Patricia W. McDowell on the occasion of her retirement from USDA Rural Development following 30 years of exemplary service to the State of Mis-sissippi and to the Nation. Raised in Jackson, Mississippi, Patricia graduated from Wingfield High School in 1974 and then attended Jackson State University. She began her career with the Farmer’s Home Administration in 1988, following employment with the American Red Cross in service to military families. Patricia’s initial duties with USDA began in the Single Family Housing Program as a Loan Clerk. She was then pro-moted to the position of Community & Busi-ness Programs Technician, and later she was promoted to the position of Loan Specialist within the Community Programs Division. In February 2017, Patricia was promoted to Community Programs Director where she has ably led the Division and will retire on Decem-ber 31, 2018. In her role as Community Programs Director for USDA Rural Development in the State of Mississippi Patricia has provided communities throughout the state with access to the serv-ices they need to grow and thrive. She has ensured that Mississippi’s rural citizens have access to basic necessities such as: safe water, electrical utilities, and healthcare serv-ices. She has worked diligently to utilize the resources under her authority to promote edu-cational opportunities, support law enforce-ment and emergency responders, and pro-mote access to childcare and other critical community facilities. In every aspect of her work, she has performed professionally and with great enthusiasm, and she is a shining example for those who will follow in her foot-steps. Mr. Speaker, too often we overlook the many contributions made by the career civil servants of the U.S. Government who work so diligently and professionally in service to their country and community. Patricia has made a career of serving others, and her work has had a direct and positive influence on the lives of literally tens of thousands of Mississippians. It is my honor to represent Ms. Patricia W. McDowell in Congress, and a privilege to offer her the genuine gratitude of this chamber in support of three exemplary decades of civil service. I congratulate Patricia for her years of service and the innumerable contributions she has made to improve the quality of life of rural Mississippians. I know her service to others is not over, and I wish her the best as she moves on to the next chapter of her life.

HONORING BMC RACING 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, December 17, 2018 Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize BMC Racing for their success in the 2018 Tour de France. BMC Racing is headquartered in Santa Rosa, California, in my district. Headed by former American cyclist Jim Ochowicz, who serves as President and team manager, the team sent six cyclists to the Tour this year, in-cluding Tejay van Garderen of Tacoma, Washington. At the 2018 Tour de France, BMC proved its abilities once again at the highest levels of competition in the cycling world. The team fin-ished eighth overall in the 2018 Tour de France, emerged victorious in the Stage 3 Team Time Trial, and earned seven yellow jer-seys—along with five stage victories. Indi-vidual team members also did well: Greg Van Avermaat stood in first place for eight con-secutive stages, while Damiano Caruso fin-ished in 20th place overall. The BMC organization regularly trains in Santa Rosa and the wine country area. They are also active in the community. Their ‘‘Cycle with Champions’’ ride is done in conjunction with Team Swift, a local youth cycling organi-zation, and many organization officials have ties to the Santa Rosa region. BMC has a his-tory of producing champion cyclists, and once again displayed their resilience and dedication in 2018. At the finish line, Damiano Caruso summed up the overall morale of the team, saying, ‘‘At the end of three weeks, I can say that my experience was positive.’’ Mr. Speaker, BMC Racing has deep roots in the Santa Rosa community, and continues to inspire generations of young cyclists. It is therefore fitting and proper that we honor the cyclists and owners on their accomplishment in this year’s Tour de France.
