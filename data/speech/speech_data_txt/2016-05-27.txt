FY 2016 Project Summarv 
The General Services Administration {GSA) proposes design and construction of an 
annex of approximately 198,000 gross square feet, including approximately 83 parking spaces, and repair, along with alteration 
of the Charles R. Jon~ Courthouse at 401 West Trade 
Street in Charlotte, NC. GSA will acquire the site from the City of Charlotte. The project 
will meet the 1 0-year space needs of the court and court-related agencies and the site will accommodate the anticipated 
30-year needs of the court. The Judiciary's Courthouse Project Priorities list (approved 
by the Judicial Conference of the United States 
on September 17, 2015)includes a courthouse project in Charlotte, NC. 
Through Public Law 108-199 (FY 2004 ), Congress appropriated a total of $8,500,000 for 
site acquisition and design of a new stand-alone courthouse in Charlotte to house the long-term needs 
of the U.S. District Court. GSA, in collaboration with the Court, has determined that alteration 
of the existing Jonas Courthouse, in conjunction with the construction 
of a new courthouse annex can best meet the space requirements of the district courts, with the application 
of the Judiciary's courtroom sharing policies and allowing for continued occupation 
of the historic Jonas Courthouse.

Overview of Proiect 
The original Jonas Courthouse was constructed in 1918 and was extended to more than double its size in 1934. The building consists 
of six courtrooms (two district, one senior, one magistrate, and two bankruptcy). The major tenants in the building are the 
U.S. 
District, Bankruptcy Courts, and U S Marshals Service. The building is listed in the National Register 
of Historic Places. 
The construction of the annex will provide additional space needed by the Courts to meet 1 
O·year space needs. The annex will be linked functionally and by building systems to the existing Jonas Courthouse, and 
will be located on the current parking Jot, directly southwest 
of the existing Courthouse. GSA will reacquire the Jonas courthouse as part 
of an exchange with the City of Charlotte. The annex and Jonas Courthouse will provide I 0 
courtrooms and 15 chambers consistent with the application of courtroom sharing policies and limitation on the provision 
of space for projected judgeships. When complete, the new annex and renovation 
of the Jonas Courthouse will provide for the 1 0-year space requirements, and the structures/site 
will allow for expansion to meet the anticipated 30-
year needs of the U.S. District Court in Charlotte. Renovation 
of the Jonas Courthouse will address several critical building needs, focusing on replacement and repair 
of the building's major systems, including plumbing, fire protection and electrical systems, which 
all require extensive refurbishment or replacement due to their age and lack 
of energy efficiency. The renovations will also include interior construction and interior finishes.

CHARLOTTE, NC PBS

The existing Jonas Courthouse is unable to meet the current and future requirements of 
the Judiciary. The current space and building infrastructure do not meet today's standards for security, operational functionality, accessibility, and environmental efficiency. Originally, the proposed strategy for satisfying the long-term needs 
of the courts in Charlotte was to consolidate the 
U.S. District Court for the Western District of 
North Carolina and various other Court-related agencies into one, newly constructed structure. As a site acquisition solution in 
2004, GSA and the City of Charlotte exchanged the Jonas Courthouse for a 3.2 acre site located at 
501 E. Trade Street. To continue housing and operations for the courts until the new stand-alone courthouse could be constructed, GSA leased the Jonas Courthouse back from the city. At the request 
of the local court in Charlotte in 2012, GSA began to examine the possibility 
of satisfying the Courts' requirements through the reacquisition of the Jonas Courthouse from the City (via a return exchange 
of the 501 E. Trade Street site), and the construction 
of a new annex. The proposed annex will be constructed on the Jonas Courthouse parking lot. This option allows the Federal Government to 
reacquire the currently occupied historic facility and continue its long-term use, as well as decrease the size and scope (from the previously authorized 
390,724 gsf) of the potential new construction in Charlotte. Due to the age 
of the. existing Jonas Courthouse, upgrades or replacement of major building systems, including plumbing, heating, ventilating, and air conditioning, electrical, and life safety, are needed to enable continued operation for the Courts and 
to 
address energy efficiency. There is no restricted circulation path for judges and they must use the freight elevator and public corridors to access their chambers. The freight elevator and 
public corridors are also used to transport prisoners, there is no sallyport, and the number 
of holding cells for courtrooms is inadequate. The addition of the annex will meet the 
long·term space needs of the Courts, while also addressing security and 
circulation deficiencies that currently exist in the Jonas Courthouse. Together, the new annex and renovation 
of the Jonas Courthouse will improve security, create discrete circulation, provide for future growth, co-locate the court family, and positively impact downtown Charlotte.

FY 2016 Project Summary 
The General Services Administration (GSA) proposes design and construction of an annex 
of approximately 96,000 gross square feet, including approximately 20 inside parking 
spac~s, and repair and alteration· of the James M. Ashley and Thomas W.L. Ashley 
U.S. Courthouse at 1716 Spielbusch Avenue in Toledo, OH. The project will 
meet the 10-year space needs of the court and court-related agencies and the structure/site 
will allow for expansion to meet the anticipated 30-year needs of the court. The Judiciary's Courthouse Project Priorities list (approved by the Judicial Conference 
of the 
United States on September 17, 2015) includes a courthouse project 
in Toledo, OH. 
Through Public Law 108-199 (FY 2004), Congress appropriated a total of $6,500,000 for site preparation and design 
of a new stand-alone courthouse in Toledo, OH, to house the long-term needs 
of the U.S. District Court. GSA, in collaboration with the Court, has determined that alteration 
of the existing Ashley Courthouse in conjunction with the construction 
of a new courthouse annex can best meet the space requirements of the district and bankruptcy courts with the application 
of the Judiciary's courtroom sharing policies and allowing for continued occupation 
of the historic Ashley Courthouse.

Overview of the Project 
The Ashley Courthouse, built in 1932, is located on the northern end of Toledo's Civic Mall. 
GSA has not conducted a major renovation to the building since construction. The building is listed in the National Register 
of Historic Places. GSA will modernize the existing Ashley Courthouse 
in conjunction with the construction of a new adjoining courthouse annex to meet the Judiciary's current and long-term needs in Toledo. When complete, the new annex and renovation 
of the Ashley Courthouse will provide for the 
10-year space requirements, and the structures/site will allow for expansion to meet the anticipated 
30-year needs of the U.S. District Court. The project includes a total of six courtrooms and eight chambers. The project reflects senior district and magistrate judge

no 
exceptions to the U.S. Courts Design Guide. The project will also support the needs of 
the United States Attorneys and the United States Marshals Services and court support services. 
GSA will first construct the new annex and once complete, the Ashley Courthouse will 
be vacated during the renovation. The new annex will be constructed on the site received under exchange in 
2001. Alteration work within the Ashley Courthouse includes upgrades to heating, ventilating, and air conditioning, electrical systems, lighting, plumbing, life safety systems (including fire alarm replacement); elevator replacement; accessibility upgrades; tenant improvements; 
fa9ade repairs; roof replacement; and hazardous material abatement.

The existing Ashley Courthouse is unable to meet the current and future requirements of 
the Judiciary. The current space and building infrastructure do not meet today's standards for security, operational functionality, accessibility, and environmental efficiency. The courthouse does not have secure circulation for judges or separate circulation for the public and prisoners. 
In addition, the building's systems are beyond their useful life. do not comply with fire/life safety standards, and 
do not meet the Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standards. In 
2001, a site was acquired in an exchange with the City ofToledo, and, in 2004, design funds were appropriated for a new courthouse project. Requirements for the original stand-alone new courthouse concept were driven by the projected need for courtrooms and chambers for existing and projected new judges. Design development was completed, but the project did not move forward at that time. The proposed project 
to 
reconfigure the existing space in the Ashley Courthouse and to construct a new courthouse annex 
in lieu of the previously proposed stand-alone courthouse is based on several factors, including space reduction efforts undertaken by the Judiciary and reduction in 
U.S. Marshals Service space requirements. GSA worked in close collaboration with the Court 
to determine that alteration of the existing Ashley Courthouse in 
cqnjunction with the construction of a new courthouse annex can best meet the space requirements 
of all impacted offices. In addition, the Office of the U.S. 
Attorney will move from leased space to the Ashley Courthouset resulting in savings of 
$594,000 in future annual lease payments to the private sector. The new requirements also reduce the Courts' space needs 
to meet the Judiciary courtroom sharing policies and do not include courtrooms for projected new judgeships. The project scope includes a reduction 
of two courtrooms from the original housing plan in support of the new stand~ 
alone courthouse.

Summary of Energx Compliance 
This project will be designed to conform to requirements of the Facilities Standards for the 
Public Buildings Service and will implement strategies to meet the Guiding 
Principles 
for High Perfonnance and Sustainable Buildings. GSA encourages design opportunities to increase energy and water efficiency above the minimum perfonnance criteria.

The General Services Administration (GSA) proposes the design and construction of a new 
U.S. Courthouse of approximately 193,000 gross square feet, including approximately 
70 inside parking spaces in Greenville, SC. GSA will construct the courthouse 
to meet the 1 0-year space needs of the court and court-related agencies and the site will accommodate the anticipated 30-year needs 
of the court. The site has been selected and all land parcels acquired. The Judiciary's Courthouse Project 
Priorities List (approved 
by the Judicial Conference of the United States on September 17, 2015) 
includes a courthouse project in Greenville, SC. 
FY 2016 House and Senate Committee Approval Requested (Additional 
Site and Design, Construction, Management & Inspection) ••.•••.. $93,999,000 
FY 2016 Funding Requested (as outlined in the FY 2016 Spend Plan) 
(Additional Site and Design, Construction, Management & Inspection) ...... $93,999,000 
Overview of Project 
The courts and related agencies are currently located in the C.F. Haynsworth Federal Building and 
U.S. Courthouse (FB-CT) in Greenville, SC, as well as various leased locations 
and government-owned locations in Spartanburg and Anderson, SC. The new courthouse 
will provide seven courtrooms and nine chambers consistent with the application 
of courtroom sharing policies and limitation on the provision of space for projected judgeships. A portion 
of those agencies housed in leased space will relocate to the new courthouse.

The existing Haynsworth FB-CT, constructed in 1937, does not meet the United States 
Courts Design Guide standards, has significant operational and building condition issues, does not provide for future expansion, and lacks adequate security. There is almost no separation 
of circulation within the facility among judges, prisoners, and the public and no prisoner sallyport. Circulation to chambers and the central cellblock is via public corridors and the facility's one elevator. 
Only the first floor courtroom has an adjacent holding cell. A restricted access parking lot is shared 
by judges, staff, and the USMS for prisoner unloading. The new courthouse 
will greatly improve the efficiency and security 
of court operations. As a result of inadequate facilities and lack of available expansion space in the FB-CT, several court-related agencies currently occupy space in leased buildings elsewhere in Greenville. Relocation 
of agencies from leased space to the new courthouse 
will result in savings of approximately $377,000 in future annual lease payments to the private 
sector. 
Due to changes in program since previous project approval, courtroom sharing, and exclusion 
of projected new judgeships, the proposed project has decreased in size and scope (from the previously approved 
257,347 gsf). Design 
Guide Exceptions The following exception to the 
U.S. Courts Design Guide was approved by the Fourth Circuit Council 
March 3, 2016 and by the Judicial Conference of the United States on 
March 15, 2016: • 
Expanded jury assembly suit (additional 436 usable square feet) with costs for this exception at approximately 
$291,000.

Future of Existing Federal Building(s)3 
GSA plans to reuse the existing Haynsworth FB-CT to house the following agencies: U.S. 
Court of Appeals; U.S. Bankruptcy Court and Clerk; Federal Public Defender; Small 
Business Administration; and the U.S. Marshals Service. This plan is tentative pending confinnation 
of agency program requirements and a feasibility study to detennine costs and 
implementation strategy, as well as future use of the Russell FB-CT and Anderson FB-CT. Challenges with hnplementing the Plan: Funding for reuse 
of the existing Haynsworth FB­
CT will likely require a future prospectus-level project. GSA will complete a feasibility study to detennine 
appropriate future funding request, schedule, and implementation of any proposed future project. As the scope 
and budget are further refmed, GSA will update the committee.

The new courthouse will consolidate all of the district court and associated U.S. Marshals 
Service space into one facility. The new courthouse will provide eight courtrooms and thirteen chambers consistent with the application 
of courtroom sharing policies and limitation 
on the provision of space for projected judgeships. The new courthouse will meet the I 
0-year needs of the courts and the site will accommodate the anticipated 30-
year needs.

The Wood Courthouse is an adaptive reuse, of a theater built for the 1968 HemisFair. The circular building has no exterior windows except for the glass 
fac;ade of the main entry. The current judges are all housed in the Wood Courthouse and utilize eight available courtrooms. There are four active district judges, one senior district judge, and three magistrate judges in 
San Antonio. Three district judges will be eligible for senior status in the 
10-year planning period and will require replacement. In addition to the courtrooms and chambers, the court also occupies over 
69,000 usable square feet (ust) in the Federal Building for c1erks, probation office, pretrial services, and other support space. The 
U.S. Marshals occupy over 7,300 usfin the Federal Building. The Wood courthouse does not lend itself to the courts' and Marshals' security needs. There is no separate circulation for the public, judges, and prisoners, no sallyport, and inadequate space for the number 
of prisoners awaiting court proceedings. The building's circular design reduces the 
space efficiency factor, results in pie-shaped courtrooms which lack adequate spectator seating, and the curved corridors are narrow with many blind spots. The courtroom holding cells open directly into the 
restrict¢ corridor, and a majority 
of the holding cells are too small to adequately meet the requirements for prisoner holding. The main 
enttjes to judges' chambers are located off the main public lobby. Due 
to space constraints, district clerk operations are split between the Wood Courthouse and the 
adjaeent Federal Building. This project will provide for co·location 
of the courts and related agencies into one location for more efficient and secure operations. The previously approved courthouse construction project is for a 
smaller site (3-4 acres), larger building (334,335 gst), and fewer jnside 
parldng spaces (37). Due to changes in program, courtroom sharing, and exc1usion 
of projected new judgeships, the proposed project is approximately 
305,000 gsf with approximately 83 inside parking spaces on approximateJy 7 acres.

After considering more than 18 possible locations and conducting a series of public 
hearings, the new courthouse site, which was the fonner location of the San Antonio 
Police Headquarters, was selected as the site with the greatest benefit to the Federal Government. 
GSA entered into an exchange arrangement with the City of San Antonio to exchange the Wood Courthouse and the 
Spears Training Center for the fonner Police Headquarters site. 
The larger courthouse site also offers compatibility with the city's Master Plan and potential for future consolidation 
of federal activities in a city with a growing federal presence. The site bas been 
cleared of all existing structures, the utilities (gas line, stonn sewer, sanitary 
sewer) have all been relocated, and the site bas been environmentally cleaned and graded and is ready for construction. 
Design Guide Exceptions The following exceptions to the 
U.S. Courts Design Guide were approved by the Fifth Circuit Council on March 
5, 2016 and by the Judicial Conference of the United States on March

Regional urinalysis laboratory (additional838 usable square feet) 
• Expanded jury assembly suite (additional 1150 usable square feet) Associated costs for these exceptions are approximately $1, I

FY 2017 Project Summary 
The General Services Administration (GSA) proposes the reconfiguration and renovation of 
space within Government-owned and leased buildings during Fiscal Year (FY) 2017 to support 
GSA's ongoing consolidation efforts to improve space utilization, optimize inventory, decrease reliance on leased space, and reduce the Government's environmental footprint. Beginning in 
FY 2014, GSA implemented its Consolidation Activities special emphasis program, aimed at helping agencies reduce their reliance on costly leased space to meet long­term housing requirements by developing strategies 
to use space more efficiently and maximize use 
of the existing federally owned inventory. Through its FY 2014 and FY 2015 Consolidation Activities projects, 
GSA is helping its partner agencies reduce space by more than 1 million square feet and reduce agency rent payments 
to GSA by $36 million and decrease GSA 
payments to private lessors, avoiding future lease payments totaling an estimated $76 million annually. 
FY 2017 Committee Approval and Appropriation Requested ............................... $75,000,000 
Program Summary 
As part of its ongoing effort to improve space utilization, optimize inventory, decrease reliance on leased space, 
and reduce the Government's environmental footprint, GSA is identifying consolidation opportunities within its inventory 
of real property assets. These opportunities are presented through surveys and studies, partnering with client agencies, and through agency initiatives, such 
as Client Portfolio Planning: Projects will vary in size by location and agency mission and operations; however, no single project will exceed 
$20 million in GSA costs. Funds will support consolidation 
of tenant agencies and will not be available for GSA internal consolidations. Preference will be given 
to projects that result in an Office Utilization Rate of 
130 usable square feet per person or less and a total project payback period of 10 years or less. Typical projects include the following: 
• Reconfiguration and alteration of existing Federal space to accommodate incoming agency relocation/consolidation. (Note: May include reconfigurations 
of existing occupied Federal tenant space) 
• Incidental alterations and system upgrades, such as fire sprinklers or heating, ventilation and air-conditioning, needed 
as part of relocation and consolidation.

• Preference is given to consolidations within or into owned buildings over consolidations within or into leased space. 
• Consolidation of expiring leases into owned buildings will be given preference over those business cases for lease cancellations that include a cancellation cost. 
• Co-location with other agencies with shared resources and special space will be given preference. 
• Links to other consolidation projects will be given preference. 
Justification 
Consistent with Administration initiatives, such as the June 2010 Presidential Memorandum, 
Disposing of Unneeded Federal Real Estate, and the Office of Management and Budget Memorandum M-12-12, 
Promoting Efficient Spending to Support Agency Operations, as well as Congressional efforts to dispose 
of excess and underutilized properties, GSA continua11y 
analyzes opportunities to improve space utilization and realize long-term cost savings for the Government. Funding for space consolidations is essential so that 
GSA can execute those opportunities. 
Projects funded under this authorization will enable agencies to consolidate within Government­controlled leased space or relocate from either Government-controlled leased or federally owned space to federally owned space that more efficiently meets mission needs. These consolidations will result in improved space utilization, cost savings for the American taxpayers, and a reduced environmental impact.

2017 Project Summary 
The General Services Administration (GSA) proposes the implementation of energy and water retrofit and conservation measures, as well as high performance energy projects, in Government­owned buildings during Fiscal Year (FY) 
2017. 
FY 2017 Committee Approval and Appropriation Requested ............................ $10,000,000 
Program Summary 
GSA proposes the implementation of energy and water retrofit and conservation measures in Government-owned buildings during 
FY 2017. 
The Energy and Water Conservation Measures Program (Program) is designed to reduce on-site energy and water consumption through building alteration projects 
or retrofits of existing buildings systems. These projects are an important part 
of GSA's approach to reach mandated percentage reduction goals through 
2025. GSA 
has identified projects in federal buildings across the country through surveys and studies. These projects will have positive savings-to-investment ratios, must provide reasonable payback periods that reflect 
GSA's priority of being a green proving ground of next generation technologies and 
may generate rebates and savings from utility companies and incentives from grid operators. This prospectus requests approval for proposed projects involving energy and water retrofit work, geothermal and other High 
Performance Green Building retrofit work, as well as design/construction work for new facilities that incorporate these technologies. The projects contained in this prospectus are for a diverse set 
of design and retrofit projects with engineering solutions to reduce energy 
or water consumption or costs, or any combination thereof. 
Projects will vary in size by location and by delivery method. Typical projects include the following: 
• Upgrading heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems with new, high­efficiency systems, including the installation 
of energy management control systems. 
• Altering constant volume air distribution systems to variable air flow systems 
by adding variable air flow boxes, fan volume control dampers and related climatic controls.

PROSPECTUS-ALTERATION 
ENERGY AND WATER RETROFIT AND CONSERVATION MEASURES PROGRAM VARIOUS BUILDINGS 
Prospectus Number: PEW-0001-MU17 
Justification 
The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (Public Law 1 09-58) required a two percent energy usage reduction 
as measured in BTU/GSF per year from 2006 through 2017 over a 2003 baseline. Guidance issued by the Department 
of Energy pursuant to this requirement states that savings anticipated from advanced metering can range from 2 to 45% annually when used in combination with continuous commissioning efforts. The provisions ofExecutive 
Order 13423, 
"Strengthening Federal Environmental, Energy, and Transportation Management," concerning energy consumption reduction were incorporated into law as the Energy Independence and Security Act 
of 2007 (EISA). These two statutes increased the energy reduction mandates to three percent per year. All Federal agencies are directed to reduce overall energy use in buildings they operate 
by 30% 
from 2003 levels and reduce overall water use by 16% from 2007 levels. Increased energy and water efficiency in buildings and operations will require capital investment for changes and modifications to physical systems that consume energy and water, as well as other high performance green building initiatives and infrastructure designs and retrofits. In addition, 
EISA included provisions that exceed the requirements 
of the Energy Policy Act of 
2005. One such long-tenn requirement is to eliminate fossil fuel-generated energy consumption in new and renovated Federal buildings 
by FY 2030 by achieving targeted reductions beginning with projects designed in 
FY 2010. Other shorter-term measures include increasing the use of 
solar hot water heating (to 30%), installation of advanced meters for steam and gas (previously only electricity was covered) and broader application 
of energy efficiency in all major renovations. Approval 
of this FY 2017 request will enable GSA to continue to provide leadership in energy/water conservation and efficiency to both the public and private sectors and to continue its efforts to meet or exceed the ambitious statutorily mandated goals.

Program Summary 
The Judiciary Capital Security Program (JCS} is dedicated to improving physical security in buildings occupied by the Judiciary and 
USMS in lieu of construction of brand new facilities, thereby providing cost savings and expedited delivery. These projects will vary in size, location, and delivery method and improve the separation 
of circulation for the public, judges, and prisoners. Funding provided for the security improvement projects would address elements such as additional doors, reconfiguring or adding corridors, reconfiguring 
or adding elevators and sallyports, and constructing physical 
or visual barriers. Justification The 
JCS will provide a vehicle for addressing security deficiencies in a timely and less costly manner when constructing a new courthouse is unlikely in the foreseeable future. In 
FY 2012, 
FY 2013, and FY 2015, GSA's appropriation included funding for this special emphasis program to undertake security improvements to buildings occupied 
by the Judiciary. In addition, the FY 
2016 President's Budget includes funding forthis program. The projects in this program are based on studies undertaken 
by the Judiciary. This prospectus requests separate funding to address specifically such security conditions at existing Federal Courthouses for locations that are unlikely to be considered for construction 
of a new courthouse~ The Judiciary's asset management planning process serves to help compile a preliminary assessment 
of potential JCS 
projects that identify courthouses with poor security ratings nationwide.

Justification $5,970,000 2,563,000 274.000 $8,807,000 
The garage is over 40 years old and is in urgent need of a major renovation. The garage is suffering from multiple concrete related failures including: delamination on the floor slabs and beams and slab reinforcement with extensive section loss; concrete spalling, and delamination at some column facades; water leakage 
on the underside of the supported level; and, deteriorated expansion joints. 
The current electrical infrastructure will be upgraded/replaced to meet current codes. 
The installation ofbollards on both the 
entrance and exit ramps of the garage will enhance security. Interim short-term repairs have been undertaken with minor repair and alteration program funds over the past decade in 
an· attempt to address immediate safety measures. The corrosion, spalling, and delamination 
of the structure is threatening tenant and property safety. 
Sections of the garage have been closed down due to the risk. Currently, there are two parking spaces closed in the lower level due to falling concrete. Ten additional

Building The Hebert Federal Building, constructed in 1939 as a Federal Building and 
U.S. Post 
Office, is a 271,000 gross square foot, steel-framed, 11-story building with a below grade basement. An example 
of the sleek 1930's Modernistic style, the building is listed in the National Register 
of Historic Places. The original U.S. Postal Service presence has been reduced, and currently the building serves primarily as a federal building.

While the Hebert Federal Building is structurally sound, the building requires significant interior alterations and systems replacement. 
Y cars of interior renovation due to changes 
in tenant occupancy have resulted in an office environment that is not fully compliant with fire and life safety codes and that has inefficient building circulation and poor telecommunication infrastructure on floors 
3-1 0. Additionally, only one unisex toilet room that conforms to most accessibility requirements has been created on each floor; however, not all are accessible from public spaces and require entering tenant space 
to 
gain access. On some floors, tenants must cross through other tenant agency space to 
reach restrooms and elevators, creating access and egress problems and firetraps in certain locations. The telecommunication infrastructure requires a number 
of upgrades to 
make it competitive with commercial space, eliminate safety hazards, and reduce the cost and difficulty 
of future tenant build-out and technology changes. Miles of abandoned-in­
place phone cabling will be removed, freeing up valuable pathways and space on equipment room floors and walls. Most 
of the building systems are outdated and have reached the end of their useful lives. The building's central plant and electrical switchgear are located in the basement, which 
is prone to flooding in heavy rain events. All central plant and electrical equipment will also be replaced and relocated from the basement to the first floor, per city code. The fire alarm and sprinkler systems have exceeded their anticipated life spans and require complete replacement. Currently, only one contractor within a 150-mile radius is capable 
of working on the old, outdated fire alarm system. Elevators are problematic and also require replacement. The plumbing and ventilation stacks in the existing restrooms are original to the building and require frequent and extensive maintenance. The existing restrooms will be recaptured as rentable space, realigning space and eliminating pockets 
of unmarketable vacant space. Historic elements, such as the original main lobby doors and elevator lobbies on all floors, will be refurbished. The building's exterior envelope is in very good condition and needs only minor repair to replace sealant and correct damage from corrosion. Minor exterior construction is required to improve accessibility 
to the building.

Proposed Project 
The proposed project replaces the deficient roofing system, including the flashing and sealants, with a new membrane roofing system coupled with 
high~efficiency insulation on the low-rise, high-rise, and breezeway portions 
of the building. The roof system will integrate a new roof-mounted photovoltaic array installed on 
the, low-rise roof. In 
addition, the project contains abatement of potential PCBs during roof demolition work and upgrades the building's pennanent 
roof anchor/fall arrest system providing additional safeguards. Existing chillers 
wi11 be replaced with new high efficiency units with non­
chlorofluorocarbon refrigerants. Waste condensate from new chiller replacement will be used to provide additional hot water for snowmelt or domestic hot water. The existing 
V AD system will be replaced and reconfigured with a highly efficient variable air volume system with reheat and a direct digital control system. The existing ductwork will be replaced 
or cleaned .. Any new equipment will be fully compatible with and tied into the existing building automation system (BAS). The existing lighting control system will be upgraded 
to incorporate an occupancy and daylighting strategies throughout the tenant floors and bi-levellighting in the stairways 
as 
well as an occupancy/dimming strategy in the garage,

The project will allow for roof replacement prior to full failure of the existing roofing system in a manner that is minimally disruptive to the tenant agencies. The low-rise structure has already suffered leaks that have severely affected tenant operations. 
If 
unfunded, recurring localized failures or full roof material failure risk damage to interior finishes, tenant property and mission, and other historic building elements. Increased energy consumption due to deterioration 
of insulation is also a risk. Additionally, the project will incorporate permanent roof-mounted fall protection features for personnel, ensuring proper life safety compliance. The current 
V AD system lacks control and responsiveness. Increased energy consumption, poor tenant comfort, and failing indoor air quality are recurring problems throughout the building. Existing chillers have reached the end 
of their useful life and require replacement. Upgrading the existing lighting controls and 
BAS will result in decreased energy consumption, thereby reducing monthly utilities

The General Services Administration (GSA) requests additional approval and funding for a repair and alteration project to renovate 985 
MiChigan Avenue in Detroit, Ml to extend service 
life, improve operational efficiency, and undertake interior alterations for reconfiguration and consolidation 
of federal agencies into the facility. The consolidation 
of federal agencies will decrease reliance on leased space, improve space utilization, and incorporate alternative workplace solutions. The Government is expected to achieve savings due 
to lease cost avoidance of approximately $7,900,000 per year. The building was constructed 
in t 995 as a build-to-suit lease to be occupied by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). 
GSA exercised a $1 lease purchase option at the end of 
the lease term and assumed ownership ofthe building onAprill6, 2015. 
This prospectus amends PMI-1951-DE15. which was approved in FY 2015, to reflect budget increases subsequent to preparation 
of the FY 2015 prospectus. Further analysis conducted after the execution 
of the purchase option and submission of the FY 2015 
prospectus identified additional elements resulting in increased costs for interior construction work and electrical upgrades and reduced/eliminated costs associated with the elevator systems, parking garage, and exterior repairs.

due to lease cost avoidance of approximately $7,900,000 per 
year. 
The building is 20 years old and was constructed for data center activities, many systems are inefficient and are approaching the 
end of their useful lives. Mechanical, electrical, elevator, and plumbing systems have operated 
2417, 365-days/year since the building was constructed in 1995. 
Upgrades to the building's infrastructure are required to extend service life, reduce energy consumption and operating expenses, and ensure long-term occupancy 
of federal tenants. The HV AC system was built for data center functionality and 
is inefficient and oversized for office use. Fire and life safety systems are not 
compliant with current code. Additionally, the building envelope is showing signs of 
deterioration. 
Summary of Energy Compliance 
This project will be designed to conform to requirements of the Facilities Standards for the Public Buildings 
Service and will implement strategies to meet the Guiding Principles 3

The McNamara Federal Building parking garage provides mission-critical parking for federal agencies housed in 
the federal building, including secure parking for federal law enforcement agencies. Original to the construction 
of the garage, the existing concrete slab structure is rapidly deteriorating with spalling concrete and rusted reinforced steel visible where sections 
of concrete have fallen from slabs. The asphalt-topped concrete decks are in very poor condition, with large potholes that have the potential to damage vehicles and injure pedestrians. Portions 
of the garage have been temporarily closed due to spalling concrete and water-related degradation. Interim repairs put 
in place over the years are also susceptible to spalling 
due to the continued water penetration and de-icing salts. Presently, 
GSA identified two areas that have potential for further structural failure that are being closely monitored. 
Short-tenn repairs undertaken over the past 10 years with minor repair and alteration program funds are in need 
of a pennanent solution. In

and mechanical, and emergency lighting systems are all failing due to age and conditions and are non-compliant with current codes. The majority 
of storm drains are cracked and inoperable, which forces water 
to seep through cracks in the concrete, causing further degradation 
of the structure. Sprinkler pipes and drain lines are corroded throughout the garage, and the incidence 
of failure is increasing over time. Ruptures in the sprinkler pipe have caused water damage 
in occupied space in the basement of the federal building due to the inoperable storm drains.

The proposed project will modernize select 62-year old building systems, address the aging infrastructure, and correct fire and life safety deficiencies to meet the long-term needs 
of USMC and other federal agencies. The flat roof will be replaced with energy­
efficient, light-colored roofing materials with added insulation, drainage improvements, and installation 
of fall protection. The HV AC system work will replace aging air handling units, boilers, the air distribution system, humidification, and hot water piping. The interior alterations include replacing plumbing fixtures and addressing Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standards issues in the restrooms; replacing the ceiling associated with HVAC, ductwork, and fire protection.. The electrical system work will include replacing the interior and exterior lighting, refurbishing two electrical substation transformers, replacing the building automation system, and install sub-metering. The proposed project will address fire and life safety concerns 
by correcting deficiencies and improving emergency access/egress deficiencies to comply with National Fire Protection Association guidelines and Occupational 
Safety and Health Administration regulations. Any hazardous materials that are encountered, including asbestos-containing materials, will 
be remediated.

was uncertain of the long-term need for 2306/2312 Bannister Road after the two major tenants, Department 
of Treasury -Internal Revenue Service and the National Archives and Records Administration, vacated the building and relocated to leased space in 
2006 and 2012, respectively. When USMC moved into the 2306 portion of the building in 
2008, the agreement was for 3 years allowing USMC to run their Information Technology Data Center. The subsequent commitment from 
USMC to continue and expand its presence at Bannister Road led 
GSA to reconsider its holding strategy determining the property to 
be a long term hold and prompting GSA to identify additional tenants for the building. FEMA, 
Anny North, and the GSA Field Office have relocated from BFC to Bannister Road, thereby avoiding the need to lease space. At the previous closed lease location, 
USDA-FSA occupied 95,289 rsf. USDA-FSA has already moved into 2312 Bannister and occupy 
103,181 usf. Relocating USDA-FSA to federal space allowed the Government to release costly leased space, thereby reducing the Government's annual lease payment 
to the private sector by approximately $711,872. The current 
USMC Occupancy Agreement contains a clause that reserves the right of 
USMC to relocate its enterprise data center to another location if GSA cannot fund this project. 
If USMC vacates this Federal Building, it would likely mean that GSA would have to dispose 
of the building displacing the other Federal tenants incurring additional relocation and leased costs.. Relocation 
by USMC would cause the greater Kansas City, 
MO, area to lose 600 high-tech jobs, resulting in serious economic ramifications.

The project proposes 
to repair the plaza at the Stokes U.S. Courthouse to eliminate water leaks and infiltration into the lower levels 
of the building. The scope includes refinishing and reinforcing the structural steel that supports the plaza, along with repairs to fireproofing and upgrading the surface parking lot. Installation 
of renewable energy and sources, such as the addition 
of wind turbines, solar panels, and a storm water capture system, are proposed for the site 
as part of this project. The project also proposes to extend the currently incomplete plaza towards Superior A venue as was originally designed. Due 
to a funding shortage when the building was originally constructed, a portion 
of the plaza was left unfinished.

The structural steel that supports the plaza is exposed to the elements and has been since the original construction. The steel has considerable rust damage, and the structural beams that support the plaza and connect into the parking garage are heavily corroded. 
Part of the unfinished plaza includes the base of the structural steel columns that are at grade with the Cleveland Regional Transit Authority train tracks and support beams that run above and across the train tracks. 
If the steel continues to be left unattended, it will become difficult 
to repair and will result in structural issues. The corroded steel is also very unsightly and takes away from the appearance 
of the modem courthouse. The plaza has experienced excessive water infiltration in many areas that will worsen until repairs are completed. The leaks have been causing damage 
to the structure, interior finishes, and the fireproofing in the lower levels 
of the building. The project's use 
of sustainable technologies of solar energy and wind capture will help to generate power to offset energy consumption for site lighting and will enable a small recovery 
of utility costs. The creation of a water capture system will be used to irrigate 2

plantings throughout the property and help recharge the heating, ventilating and air conditioning units, which will reduce the facility's reliance on domestic water sources. The plaza surrounding the Stokes Courthouse remains incomplete from the time 
of the original construction in 
2002. The sidewalk on the northwest side of the site is built on a portion 
of city-owned/controlled Huron Road. This sidewalk is the only way to access the building from the southeast intersection 
of Huron Road and Superior Avenue. Once 
the plaza is completed, the sidewalk will be returned to the city, and this will restore a lane 
of traffic on Huron Road. Completion of the plaza will protect the structural steel from future damage, improve pedestrian access to the building, incorporate the building into the surrounding urban environment, and significantly improve the appearance 
of the Stokes Courthouse. The building's location within the city acts 
as a prominent gateway for those entering into the city from the west. Unfortunately, this impression is lost when visitors reach the intersection 
of Huron Road and Superior Avenue, where the steel installed for the completion 
of the plaza is rusting and the appearance of the facility at street level is that 
of a public building that is difficult to approach. 
Summary of Energy Compliance 
This project will be designed to conform to requirements of the Facilities Standards for the Public Buildings Service and will implement strategies to meet the Guiding Principles for High Performance and Sustainable Buildings. 
GSA encourages design opportunities to increase energy and water efficiency above the minimum performance criteria.

The proposed project includes both structural and non-structural repairs to address existing deficiencies and improve the seismic performance 
of the 911 Federal Building. The proposed project will also allow 
GSA to consolidate NOAA- Fisheries from leased space to the

Justification $16,900,000 2,300,000 $19,200,000 
The wing and tower have seismic deficiencies that must be repaired and the second floor office space cannot 
be backfilled until the entire Federal Building is in compliance with current seismic code. 
The hollow clay tile partitions are deteriorating which may create a falling hazard. The tower structure deficiencies will not adequately perform under maximum earthquake loading Deficiencies have also been identified with the concrete shear walls, supporting columns and steel bracing. Although the tower's structure has a lateral force resisting system, it does not meet seismic code and 
will not perform under maximum earthquake loading. The tower has insufficient strength in North-South and 
East.:.West directions to resist anticipated seismic loads; concrete shear walls that are overstressed and some are discontinuous at the basement levels, resulting in overstressed supporting columns; inadequate 
or non-existent collector elements to anchor floor diaphragms to stairwell cores; inadequate steel braced frames; hollow clay tile partitions 
in the basements, stairwells and elevators; and inadequate bracing 
of fire suppression and gas piping. 
Once the structural and non-structural seismic upgrades are complete, NOAA-Fisheries will backfill approximately 
33,500 rsf of vacant space. Backfilling the vacated space eliminates approximately 
$680,000 in annual lease payments to the private sector. The new space layout will allow Fisheries to become more efficient, house

Proposed Project 
The primary drivers for the proposed renovation is to improve the overall utilization of 
the Green Federal Building, Improved utilization will be accomplished by merging operations through consolidating additional employees from multiple leases into the Green Federal Building. Through innovative approaches to space management and alternative workplace arrangements, including the realignment 
of agencies onto contiguous floors and sharing resources such as conference rooms and other specialized space, the overall utilization rate for the building is expected to improve 
by 
approximately 20 percent To adequately support the increased utilization and higher density, this project also includes upgrades/replacement 
of multiple building systems. The first phase 
of the project will focus on the lower half of the building, allowing the tenants occupying these floors to consolidate and reduce their footprint, resulting 
in the creation· 
of vacant space that will serve as internal swing space for Phase II. Work under the first phase to the mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and fire life safety systems will affect both tenant and building wide components. HVAC work includes replacing mixing boxes and the chiller plant, refurbishing the cooling tower and replacing/reconfiguring ductwork and fan coil units within tenant space. Electrical upgrades/replacements will be made both within tenant suites and in common corridors and joint use spaces, while new domestic water risers will be installed to address plumbing. Sprinklers will be relocated, upgraded, and replaced, where necessary. Additionally, this phase also will upgrade some 
of the building's joint use space, such as reducing the size 
of the cafeteria and increasing the number and size of conference spaces

environment essential to collaborating with local law enforcement and other stakeholders. 
It will also facilitate improved handling of the expanding intelligence mission of these agencies in the most efficient and cost-effective manner while providing state 
of the art infrastructure. As part 
of the reconfiguration and renovation of tenant space, multiple building systems will be upgraded. 
It is prudent to accomplish reconfiguration of the ductwork and sprinklers and replacement 
of fan coil units while space is vacant. The ductwork and electrical system are outdated and in need 
of upgrades/replacement and reconfiguration to accommodate the proposed open office floor plans. Sprinklers need 
to be relocated and upgraded/replaced, where necessary, to facilitate a new open office layout. The fan coil units are beyond their useful life and are no longer able 
to regulate the temperature in the suites properly. The cooling tower and the chiller plant need 
to be addressed to integrate properly with the needs 
of the new tenant space. Elevator components need to be upgraded, and one elevator 
will be converted for prisoner transport use. At present, the visitor screening area is insufficient to handle the amount 
of foot traffic the building receives, and long lines result in spillover to the plaza area, posing a potential security risk. The building's current circulation needs to be improved. 
Paths 
for the public, tenants, and secure transfer of prisoners are not clear and often overlap. The screening area, along with the circulation paths, will be defined and properly located during the restacking 
of the building. The Facility Security Committee (FSC) met and voted to incorporate security upgrades into the project, which 
will improve building performance by reducing hazardous glass failure, reducing the risk 
of progressive collapse, and mitigating potential injuries under certain threat scenarios. Based on the decisions made 
by the FSC, GSA is seeking funding to improve the physical security posture 
of the building with a goal of completing the work without further disruption to 
the tenants and without the increased costs associated with completing the work after the tenants have moved into the newly renovated space. 
Summary of Energy Compliance 
This project will be designed to confonn to requirements of the Facilities Standards for the 
Public Buildings Service and will implement strategies to meet the Guiding Principles 
for High Performance and Sustainable Buildings. GSA encourages design opportunities to increase energy 
and water efficiency above the minimum performance criteria.

$17,863,000 Historically, the building has been used by Treasury as 
one of four regional check printing and distribution facilities for federal obligations to vendors and the general public. Treasury's transition to electronic transfer 
of funds resulted in the removal of all check printing and distribution functions and has significantly altered the type and amount 
of space the agency requires. 
The 46-year-old building has undergone various renovation projects over the years, but never a complete modernization including upgrades. 
The space converted from light industrial to office use does not include the appropriate lighting, HV AC, ceilings, or finishes for office space. 
The building systems are outdated and have reached the end of 
their useful lives. The HV AC equipment has reached or surpassed its life expectancy. 
The control system and related electronic components need frequent repairs and parts are no longer available. Upgrades to the exterior include replacement 
of a 22-year-old roof 
that has required repair numerous times. The storm water and sanitary lines do not meet current code and need to 
be separated. Runoff from heavy rains often floods the loading 
dock's storm drain, causing flooding in the building when floor drains back up. All the domestic water lines are old, corroded, and need to 
be replaced. Restrooms need

$65,000,000 $8,500,000 $54,500,000 $2,000,000 $8,500,000 
The General Services Administration (GSA) proposes $8,500,000 for the design of a repair and alteration project for the Joseph 
P. Addabbo Federal Building at 155-10 Jamaica Avenue, Queens, New 
York. 
The 932,000 gross square foot Addabbo Federal Building, constructed in 1989, is a 12-story masonry and steel office building with a mechanical penthouse and one level 
of below grade parking containing 44 spaces. The project will reconfigure space to allow for the consolidation 
of 
Social Security Administration (SSA) operations on the lower floors (2-7) within the building. The consolidation 
of SSA operations will allow for the eventual build-out of office space for future federal tenants currently housed 
in leased space in the vicinity of Queens, NY. This project also includes the design 
of some shell office space for future backfill tenants. The project will promote economies 
of scale and will provide opportunities for maximizing space efficiency, operational flexibility, and sharing special support spaces and building amenities. The proposed project will support 
SSA and GSA's ongoing efforts to improve utilization of 
space occupied by SSA and realize an overall improvement of space from over 400 usable square feet (usf)/per person to approximately 
200 usf/per person. The project will support 
GSA's ongoing efforts to maximize the use of federally owned space by moving Federal tenants currently housed in over 
700,000 square feet ofleased space into a Federal facility.

DC Overview 
ofFY2017 Proposed Project PBS 
PDC-0002-WA17 GSA 
proposes to continue the ongoing development of the DHS consolidated headquarters at the 
St. Elizabeths Campus by: 1) continuing design and full construction of a new federal headquarters 
tor FEMA; 2) rehabilitating buildings needed to accommodate components of the Under 
Secretary of Management (USM) that are currently planned for the Center Building Complex (Holly 
and Creamery clusters); 3) continuing design of phase 3 construction to house Immigration and Customs Enforcement; 4) ongoing historic preservation activities in support 
of 
landscaping and public outreach; and 5) management and inspection funding for these activities. The 
FY2017 request includes design completion, management and inspection, and construction 
of an appropriately sized building to accommodate all of the Headquarters components of 
FEMA. This funding also includes a related below grade parking structure to be constructed adjacent to Gate No. 2 along Martin Luther King, Jr. A venue. FEMA Headquarters components are currently 
located in four leased buildings in the Washington, DC metropolitan area. The 
FY2017 request also includes funds to rehabilitate six existing historic structures that comprise the Holly and Creamery clusters. These buildings are located adjacent to the Center Building that is currently being rehabilitated 
to accommodate the DHS Secretary's office and mission critical leadership components within that office. The Center Building Complex will house components within the Office 
of the Under Secretary for Management that will not be 
housed in buildings being rehabilitated with FY2016 appropriations. The 
FY2017 request also supports initial design of a new federal building for ICE headquarters leadership components currently located in leased buildings in Washington, DC and ongoing Historic Preservation activities. Historic preservation activities will ensure that the landscape work is consistent with the preservation requirements and public outreach is consistent with the agreements in .place in support 
of the construction of the Consolidated DHS Headquarters at St. 
Elizabeths.

Overview of Project 
GSA and DHS have worked collaboratively to update and revise the original DHS HQ consolidation program at the 
St. Elizabcths Campus. The updated program, referred to as the Enhanced 
Plan, seeks a more efficient utilization of space at a lower cost. The West Campus is a 
176--acre National Historic Landmark that includes existing buildings containing approximately 1 million gross sq. 
ft. (GSF) plus newly constructed buildings such as the Douglas A. Munro Coast Guard Headquarters Building. Under the Enhanced 
Plan, DHS and GSA cut back on the overall scope of the program. DHS 
components will require less space through realized efficiencies and improved utilization rates, plus the FEMA headquarters that 
was planned tor the East Campus was moved to the West Campus. 
The West Campus, however, will continue to be developed in accordance with guidelines set out in the Master Plan as amended and/or as a result 
of continued compliance with NHPA and NEPA during specific project designs.
3 
Committee approval and appropriations for Phase 1 of the project -construction of a new headquarters facility for the 
USCG called the Munro Building -have a1ready been obtained. Development 
of Phase 2a includes: construction of office space to consolidate DHS 
headquarters and the re-scoped DHS Operations Center (DOC), house various DHS leadership components, and provide amenity space. 
Phase 2b proposes the construction of a new headquarters facility for FEMA plus appropriate amenity space. Parking will 
a1so be included with these later phases. 
Phase 3 will accommodate portions of the remaining elements of DHS 
headquarters units such as CBP and ICE. The project will include the rehabilitation of existing space as well as construction 
of new space. This prospectus seeks approval for new construction 
of the FEMA headquarters. Also included will be rehabilitation 
of existing buildings, historic preservation, and design. 
1 This represents the balance of committee approval needed for this prospectus submission less remaining appropriations needed for the Infrastructure 
Program which is subject to the requirements of 40 U.S.C. Section 3307.

construction originally included in the Infrastructure budget in prior years that has been moved to 
the Highway Interchange program budget in Part lJl of this prospectus. 
The planned alterations arc necessary to preserve, maintain, and reuse this historic site. Existing 
infrastructure and the landscape have suffered from aging and deferred maintenance. The utility distribution systems arc antiquated and deteriorated. Building repairs include repair and improvement 
of structural and lite safety systems while maintaining historic integrity. The landscape will 
be maintained, protected, and preserved to the extent feasible.

DC III. HIGHWAY INTERCHANGE 
PROGRAM SUMMARY PBS PDC-0002-WA17 
The Highway Interchange Program that was developed as part of the Master Plan proposes an 
access road to the St. Elizabeths West Campus that extends between Firth Sterling Avenue to the north 
and Malcolm X A venue to the south, parallel to Interstate-295. Funds for construction of 
the access road in the amount of $46 mil1ion were originally included in the Infrastructure program described above, but additional transportation improvements have subsequently been identified. A new, reconfigured interchange between Malcolm X Avenue 
and I-295 is one of 
these improvements. This reconfiguration will be necessary to direct St. Elizabeths traffic onto the access 
road that, in tum, will mitigate the impacts of additional traffic that is anticipated as 
the result of the redevelopment of St. Elizabeths. GSA worked closely with FHW A and the DC 
Department of Transportation to prepare an Interchange Justification Report (IJR) to facilitate required modifications 
to the Malcolm X Interchange. Other related transportation improvements that are needed 
as a result of the St. EHzabeths development are also included below as separate line items. These improvements need 
to be funded in conjunction with Phase 2 of the project to 
avoid further schedule delays and cost escalations.

IV. HISTORIC PRESERVATION MITIGATIONS PROGRAM SUMMARY 
As of December 9, 2008, GSA and DHS along with NCPC entered into a Programmatic Agreement (PA) with the Advisory Council on Historic 
Preservation (ACHP), the District of 
Columbia Historic Preservation Oftice (DCHPO), and the United States Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). The 
PA outlines five (5) specific mitigation actions that must be undertaken 
by GSA to "resolve adverse effects from certain complex project situations".9 These actions arc as follows: 
1. Documentation and recordation including buildings and site, as needed, archives, historic structure reports, building preservation plans, landscape preservation treatment and management, and archaeological resources treatment and management; 
2. Public outreach, interpretation, and education including the establishment of a citizens advisory panel, a pennanent interpretative exhibit, a museum and visitors education center, signage, and public relations materials; 
3. Public access program to be developed by GSA and DHS; · 
4. Conservation and artifact preservation; and 
5. The 19111 Century cemetery including interpretative program, perpetual care, and public access.

Cogeneration and Waste Heat: Approximately 30% of the campus power will be produced on site via cogeneration. This percentage represents 
I 00% of the critical campus electrical needs in 
times of emergencies. The waste heat generated by the natural gas fired turbines will be converted to both steam and hot water to help heat the buildings and, through steam driven absorption chillers, to help cool the buildings. 
Solar Energy: Photovoltaic energy collection arrays were considered for electric street lighting but did not meet historic preservation requirement. Large photovoltaic arrays were also found to 
be untenable at the site due to the limited acreage that could be used to house the solar panels. However, solar energy collecting panels 
or roofing membranes have been incorporated on portions 
of the roof tops, for example, the Detached Dining Hall being rehabilitated for use as a cafeteria. Geothermal: Geothermal 
wells will be considered to support heat pump systems for new construction 
of the support buildings, such as the remote delivery facility and pump house. If 
viable, future appropriations will be requested.

FY2017 Proiect Summary PBS 
PND-0550-PE17 
01 
The General Services Administration (GSA) proposes the acquisition of approximately eight acres 
of land, along with the design and construction of a new 6,685 gross square foot facility for the United 
States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant 
Health Inspection Service (APHIS) at the Pembina, ND, U.S. Land Port of Entry (LPOE). 
Construction of this facility provides a pennanent solution for APHIS at a secure location directly on the port, remedies a potential life safety concern with the current location 
of 
the temporary modular trailer, improves traffic configuration, ·places all APHIS 
operations on the U.S. side of the U.S./Canada border and eliminates rental payments to the private sector 
of approximately $317,000 annually. This project was among those previously included in 
GSA's FY 2015 and FY 2016 
Capital Investment Program. The prospectus was approved by the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure but not approved 
by the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works. The project could not 
be accommodated within the enacted levels in 
FY 2015 and FY 2016. GSA is resubmitting the project in FY 2017 
with no change in scope and a change in budget to account for escalation since its original submission.

The Pembina, NO, U.S. LPOE is the busiest northern port between B1aine, Washington and Detroit, Michigan, and the fifth busiest along the U.S./Canada border. The port has seen a steady increase in traffic flow since its completion in 1997. In 
2003, in response 
to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the original APHIS building was demolished to 
accominodate new LPOE Vehicle and Cargo Inspection System (VACIS) requirements. A modular trailer was leased and moved to a landscape median island near the center 
of 
the port as a temporary housing solution for APHIS. On-load inspections are conducted at this location (in the median with traffic flowing 
on both sides). Off-load inspections are performed at the Emerson Canadian 
Port where GSA leases another facility for 
APHIS approximately one mile north and east of the Pembina LPOE. This is operationally inefficient. Commercial truck parking and circulation are inadequate with little or no lane control. With the increase in traffic flow this has created a potential life safety concern for 
APHIS 
inspectors and truck drivers. In addition to the potential life safety concern, the temporary modular trai1er is in poor condition and requires ongoing repairs to keep the building habitable. The proposed project 
will provide APHIS with a facility that is operationally safe and efficient. Construction 
of a pennanent inspection facility will not materially hinder any operations at the port. 
7 Upon construction completion, the newly converted wetlands will be monitored for a period of at least five years to ensure a successful conversion.

Approximately three acres of undeveloped government-owned wetlands on the southwest corner 
of the Pembina Port will be used to prepare the new project site. A thorough 
Feasibility Study has determined the proposed site to be the most advantageous location to maximize traffic flow and security for the 
Port and its stakeholders. To mitigate the reduction 
of wetlands to the environment, the NEPA requires the creation of two net new acres 
of wetlands per each acre of wetlands negatively affected by construction. 
Since it is somewhat common for a small portion of newly created human-made wetlands to fail to convert properly 
to permanent wetlands, an extra two acres of site acquisition have been included in the project for contingency purposes, allowing for the acquisition 
of up to eight acres ofland for wetland mitigation. The newly converted wetlands will be monitored for a period 
of at least five years to ensure a successful conversion. 
Upon project completion, on-load inspections will take place in 15 open-air commercial truck parking 
stal1s just outside of the new building. This will no longer require inspector personnel or truck operators to cross several lanes 
of oncoming traffic on foot. 
Other .alternatives (off of the port) pose security challenges to APHIS inspection personnel and 
U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and logistics issues for commercial truck operators. Alternatives locating the 
APHIS facility in different areas on the port were problematic due to traffic flow constraints. 
The proposed plan is in a strategically situated area to facilitate maximum traffic flow at the port. 
Summary of Energy Compliance 
This project will be designed to confonn to requirements of the Facilities Standards for the 
Public Buildings Service and will implement strategies to meet the Guiding Principles for High Performance and Sustainable Buildings. The 
GSA encourages design opportunities to increase energy and water efficiency above the minimum performance criteria. The proposed project 
is Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) and Energy 
Policy Act (EP ACT) compliant.

The U.S. General Services Administration {GSA} proposes a lease of approximately 
131,000 rentable square feet (RSF} for the Department of Agriculture (USDA}, currently 
located at 31 0 I Park Center Drive, Alexandria, VA, under a lease that expires May 3 I, 
2017. 
The lease will provide continued housing for USDA and improve USDA office and 
overall utilization rates from 141 to 93 usable square feet (USF) per person and 215 to 
150 USF per person, respectively. As a result of the improved utilization, the lease will 
reduce the rentable square footage (RSF) of the requirement by 29 percent, a 53,216 RSF

Current Total Annual Cost: $5,317,419 (leases effective 6/J. 1007) Justification 
The current lease at 310 t Park Center Drive, Alexandria, VA, expires on May 3 t. 2017 
and houses the USDA Food and Nutrition Service (FNS), whose main mission is to 
increase food security and reduce hunger in partnership with cooperating organizations 
by providing children and low-income people access to food, a healthy diet, and nutrition 
education in a manner that supports American agriculture and inspires public confidence. 
FNS work has become increasingly collaborative and the current space at 3101 Park 
Center Drive is not configured to support modem work patterns. A new lease win 
provide continued housing for 725 personnel currently working in this location and allow 
for a flexible office layout to adapt to future changes in work practices. The total space requested 
will reduce USDA's footprint by 53,216 RSF, or 29 percent of the 184,216 
RSF ctUTently occupied. ln the absence of this reduction, the status quo cost of continued 
occupancy at the proposed market rate would be $7,184,424 per year. 
Summary of Energy Compliance 
GSA will incorporate energy efficiency requiremenls into the Request for Lease 
Propo!!>als and other documents related to the procurement of space based on the 
approved prospectus. GSA encourages offerors to exceed minimum requirements set 
forth in the procurement and to ~chieve an Energy Star performance rating of 75 or 
higher. 
Rcsohations of Approval

SPEECH OF  
HON. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN 
OF MARYLAND  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, May 23, 2016 Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in op-position to H.R. 4889. While I agree with the underlying goal of this bill, in its current form it does not provide enough privacy protections. The ability to quickly locate potential victims in an emergency is very important but we should also eliminate the potential for abuse. I was disappointed that Congressional Republicans refused to accept common sense proposals that would have allowed us to obtain the ben-efit of the proposal without opening the door to abuse or violations of Constitutional rights. I hope in the coming months we can pass the bill with adequate provisions.

CONGRATULATIONS TO BIR-MINGHAM CITY SCHOOL SYS-TEM’S CLASS OF 2016 VALEDIC-TORIANS 
HON. TERRI A. SEWELL 
OF ALABAMA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, May 27, 2016 Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to congratulate Birmingham City School System’s Class of 2016 Valedic-torians—all of whom are female. As the head-line reads in the local paper, ‘‘Talk about major girl power.’’ At last count, these young ladies have received more than ‘‘$2.85 million in scholarship offers for 2016.’’ The Bir-mingham City School System also had two Gates Millennium Scholars this year including Ramsay High School’s Valedictorian, Maya Quinn. The Class of 2016 Valedictorians includes: Parker High School’s Alejandrina Bravo; Woodlawn High School’s Michelle Thomas; Huffman High School’s Kierra Hutchins; Jack-son-Olin High School’s Alana Bennett; Ramsay High School’s Maya Quinn; and Carver High School’s Jamerial Gardner and Ariana Robinson. Carver High School was unique in that they had two students tie for valedictorian this year. Mr. Speaker, while most of the communities in my district are greatly underserved, we con-tinuously see what is possible from our citi-zens with a little bit of resources and whole bunch of hard work. We know that when women succeed, Amer-ica succeeds. And these young women are on the path to bright futures, and to giving back in hopefully meaningful ways to our commu-nities, and should be commended for their out-standing achievements. I am sure they will look back proudly on this accomplishment as they blaze their respective paths in life. Mr. Speaker, I want my colleagues to join me in congratulating the outstanding women who serve as 2016 Valedictorians in the Bir-mingham City School System. Girl Power! f 
IN HONOR OF THE 40TH ANNIVER-SARY OF THE WYOMING CON-FERENCE OF BUILDING OFFI-CIALS 
HON. CYNTHIA M. LUMMIS 
OF WYOMING  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, May 27, 2016 Mrs. LUMMIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the Wyoming Conference of Building Officials, to recognize the leadership of the Wyoming Chapter of the International Code Council (ICC) that develops and publishes the model building, safety and energy efficiency model codes used in my home state of Wyoming, and each of the other 49 states. Confidence in building safety is achieved through the devotion of vigilant guardians— building safety and fire prevention officials, ar-chitects, engineers, builders, tradespeople, la-borers and others in the construction industry who work year-round to ensure the safe con-struction of the buildings in which we live and work. Thirty-one people from eighteen cities across the state of Wyoming attended the very first meeting of the newly formed Wyoming Association of Building Officials on January 23, 1976 in Gillette, Wyoming. The following inaugural officers were elected at that first meeting in Gillette: President Ralph Rock, Building Inspector, Gillette, WY; Vice Presi-dent Joe Keefer, Building Inspector, Douglas, WY; Secretary-Treasurer Thomas W. Cham-bers, Cody, WY; Director R.G. Patton, Building Inspector, Cody, WY; and J.J. Ireland, Building Inspector, Cheyenne, WY. Over the past forty years the Wyoming Con-ference of Building Officials has provided con-tinuing education for design professionals, fire service and the public. It has provided more than $18,000 in scholarships to Wyoming resi-dents to attend the International Code Coun-cil’s Annual Conference to learn more on the latest building standards and codes. And, it has published numerous articles in the Build-ing Safety Journal. The current Board of the Wyoming Con-ference of Building officials—President Keith Bowar of Campbell County, WY; Vice Presi-dent Lyle Murdock of Wright, WY; Treasurer Billy Nunn of Jackson, WY; Director Matt Allred of Guernsey, WY; Director Ken Rogers of Gillette, WY; and Past President Bruce Wil-son of Cheyenne, WY, currently represent 90 members across 48 jurisdictions. I would like to thank the thousands of men and women who work every day to make sure our country’s buildings comply with the most updated building and fire safety codes. And I would like to especially thank those hard work-ing members of the Wyoming Conference of Building Officials, celebrating their 40th anni-versary of service to the citizens of the great state of Wyoming. f 
PERSONAL EXPLANATION 
HON. EARL BLUMENAUER 
OF OREGON  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, May 27, 2016 Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, last night, as I celebrated the passage of Representative S
EAN PATRICK MALONEY ’s amendment to pro-hibit the federal government from doing busi-ness with contractors who discriminate against LGBT individuals, I was dismayed to realize that, as the vote was closing, I had failed to press the button to vote to support the amend-ment, which would have made the margin of victory even larger. I voted for the amendment last week, and I continue to strongly support efforts to ensure equality for the LGBT com-munity. The anti-LGBT amendments offered to the same bill, which I stanchly oppose, dem-onstrate the all too real, continued discrimina-tion that the LGBT community faces, even after historic achievement of marriage equality and the repeal of ‘‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.’’

IN REMEMBRANCE OF THE LIFE OF SARID CHAIM SHAHDAIAH AND QUINCY GEMAL WILLIAMS 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, May 27, 2016 
‘‘What is a fear of living? It’s being pre-eminently afraid of dying. It is not doing what you came here to do, out of timidity and spinelessness. The antidote is to take full responsibility for yourself—for the time you take up and the space you oc-cupy. If you don’t know what you’re here to do, then just do some good.’’—Maya Angelou 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in remembrance and recognition of the life of Sarid Chaim Shahdaiah, and Quincy Gemal Williams two very accomplished young men who tragically lost their lives in a car ac-cident on December 3, 2014. Many parents, teachers, neighbors and young people hope to find the kindness and dedication that these two young men exhibited regularly as sons, students, friends and in-credibly well-rounded, commendable young men. The accomplishment these young men earned far exceed the highest expectations of any proud parent or community member in awe of exceptional young leaders in today’s America. I understand as well, that in recognition and honor of his pursuit of excellence, several highly esteemed universities expressed inter-est in Mr. Shahdaiah, hoping that he would join their respected student bodies.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD —Extensions of RemarksE814 May 27, 2016 
I was thoroughly impressed to learn that, through his dedication to his studies; Mr. Shahdaiah earned a grade point average of 3.6 and was inducted into the National Society of High School Scholars. As a highly accomplished student-athlete, he served the U.S.A. International Football Team as Captain, Team Ambassador and starting linebacker, in addition to exalting fer-vent school pride, during his junior year as a highly valued teammate of the Dekaney Wild-cats, his high school varsity track and football teams. Expanding the bounds of his requisite stud-ies, he explored his curiosities for the world of science becoming a member of the Texas High School Engineering Career and Tech-nology Council. I join his family and many admirers in genu-inely celebrating Mr. Shahdaiah’s life and out-standing contributions. Quincy was one of the world’s best come-dians; he had the ability to make anyone who came into contact with him laugh. All who knew Mr. Williams admired his prowess for presentation. Deemed one of the ‘‘Sharpest’’ brothers you’d meet. Mr. Williams was affectionately called by his parents a ‘‘Junior’’; and was one of the most outgoing, lovable kids that a parent could ever want. Although young in body Mr. Williams was old in song; he was a profound lover of any and all Motown Performers and would listen to them regularly. While at Andy Dekaney High school Quincy became branded as the ‘‘Soul Brother’’ of the football team. These two young men cultivated their ef-forts, positioning themselves to successfully matriculate in May of 2016; and, but for their ill-fated passing, would by all accounts have celebrated their well-deserved accomplish-ments with their families as a milestone achievement in their young lives. While I have no doubt they would have real-ized countless ambitions, we are left to accept that their dreams of immeasurable magnitude now rest with them. These young men worked hard. I cannot think of a more solemn manner of celebrating their life than to honor their efforts by bestowing upon their families recognition of the achievement for which they so ardently strode. In the words of Booker T. Washington ‘‘Character is power’’. Character truly is power and that power was present in the lives of these prolific young men. Yes, their lives were cut short, but with what time they did have they effectively made the best of it. Heaven has truly gained a dynamic pair of angels, while young Mr. Shahdaiah’s and Mr. Williams families lost their most promising stars. Please join me in a moment of silence for the life of Sarid Chaim Shahdaiah and Quincy Gemal Williams. TRIBUTE TO SANDRA THORSTENSON 
HON. LINDA T. SA´NCHEZ 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, May 27, 2016 Ms. LINDA T. SA´NCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the lifelong service and success of Sandra Thorstenson, the Superintendent of Whittier Union School District, in my Congressional District in Cali-fornia. You could say that the Whittier Union School District is part of Sandra’s DNA. After moving to Whittier at the age of five, Sandy went on to graduate from Whittier High School, attended Whittier College, and from there, launched a 39-year career as a teacher, principal, and Superintendent of the district. While I think Sandy’s lifelong dedication to educating young people is reason enough to celebrate, I would be remiss not to mention the success that has made her a leader in im-proving education for low-income students. Under her leadership, Whittier Union’s motto has been ‘‘demographics do not determine destiny.’’ The results of this attitude are clear. In a district with nearly 70 percent economi-cally-disadvantaged students, Whittier Union sports a 97 percent graduation rate and sends 95 percent of its students on for a higher edu-cation. Ms. Thorstenson embodies the kind of pub-lic servant and leader we need more of in education, someone who is unwilling to settle for anything less than success for every stu-dent in her district. It is in that spirit that, on behalf of all the families who’ve benefitted from her service, I wish Sandra a happy retire-ment and thank her for inspiring generations of students in the Whittier Union School Dis-trict.

TRIBUTE TO BRUCE PEARSON 
HON. HENRY CUELLAR 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, May 27, 2016 Mr. CUELLAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the retirement of Bruce Pearson, who has been City Manager of Pleasanton, Texas since 2012. Mr. Pearson was born and raised in Waco, Texas where he attended Richfield High School. He later graduated Summa Cum Laude from Texas State University-San Marcos and received a Master’s Degree from the University of Texas at San Antonio in Pub-lic Administration where he was a Recognized Scholar. Mr. Pearson also holds a Certified Public Manager’s Certification from the William P Hobby Center for Public Service at Texas State University. In 2000, Mr. Pearson began working for the San Antonio Water System, where he was in-volved in the implementation of a revolutionary water recycling system that provides over 35,000 acre feet of water for non-potable uses throughout San Antonio. The water recycling program remains the largest in the country to date. The Water Reuse Foundation recog-nized Mr. Pearson for his contributions to water conservation efforts in 2005. Addition-ally, Mr. Pearson advised on the design of a customer service and site certification manual for the Water Reuse Foundation, and worked on the Cibolo Canyons Professional Golfers’ Association Project for the San Antonio Water System. Mr. Pearson began his career in public serv-ice in 2008 when he was named Assistant City Manager for the City of Cibolo. As Assist-ant City Manager, he oversaw the implemen-tation of a capital improvement project that al-lowed the city to build a new police and fire Station, a public park, and to reconstruct the city’s Main Street. In 2012, Mr. Pearson was named City Manager for the City of Pleasanton; a position through which he con-tributed to the city’s growth, development, and prosperity. He oversaw the development and implementation of a multifaceted city master plan, a parks master plan, and contributed to the design and construction of a civic center, library, and the Freedom Center Project. Mr. Pearson has done an extraordinary job of bringing a vision of long term progress in every community he has worked in. In addition to his impressive career in public service and municipal development, Mr. Pear-son is a devoted father and grandfather. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to recognize Bruce Pearson for his extensive achievements and important contributions to the communities of Cibolo and Pleasanton, Texas. f

REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF SUSAN TOLCHIN 
HON. MARCY KAPTUR 
OF OHIO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, May 27, 2016 Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life of Susan J. Tolchin, some-one who I had the privilege to work with and who I had long admired for her curiosity, her judgment, and her concern for others. An ardent feminist, who along with her hus-band Marty, brought attention to the plight of middle-class working women, a class of Amer-icans often overlooked and rarely chronicled, Susan and Marty authored several books to-gether, all of which highlighted the mecha-nisms that the Tolchin’s considered ‘‘occupa-tional hazards of democracy.’’ As an author and a professor, Susan fo-cused on and scrutinized political patronage and its many pitfalls, and was one of the first political scientists to identify growing voter dis-enchantment and disillusion with their govern-ment. She wisely concluded that these con-cerns were deeply rooted in the women’s and worker’s rights issues, largely discounted and ignored by policymakers, but which she sought to highlight through her teaching and writings. In her seminal and sage work on political patronage, Susan redefined political patronage as that which ‘‘includes the vast range of fa-vors awarded by constantly expanding govern-ments.’’ Likewise, her work on evolving voter anger was cutting-edge analysis, far ahead of her peers. For those who had the fortune to know her, Susan was an engaging and charming con-versationalist, with a natural curiosity and abil-ity to learn from others. She was always learn-ing and seeking new ideas, and applying this knowledge to her scholarship in the classroom and in her writings in political journals, maga-zines and books. Susan’s legacy of scholarship has provided those of us who also champion women’s and laborers’ rights with a critical knowledge base. Her work was inspirational, and insightful, and helped me and many others to understand trends and the undercurrents that caused them which others might have missed. Susan was not only dedicated to struggles of the working, middle-class women, but also to her family, whom she loved dearly. She and her husband Martin worked closely together for many decades, authoring many books. She adored her daughter Karen, also a professor, and their charming grandson, Charlie. They were quite a team, Susan and Marty, always joyful and supportive of each other. Those who were fortunate to have known and loved Susan, or who had followed her work, will miss her terribly. Her passion was an inspiration for many, and one can only hope that her passing will not be the last chapter of her story, but that she will continue to inspire countless others. She certainly in-spired me. f 
MONTENEGRO SHOWS THE VIRTUE OF SELF-DETERMINATION 
HON. DANA ROHRABACHER 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, May 27, 2016 Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, the right of self-determination is today manifested by unhappy ethnic and national groups in almost every corner of the world—Scotland, Catalonia, Baluchistan, Biafra, or Kashmir. Current national establishments, as well as international organizations and alliances, how-ever, fear changing the map, terrified by any proposal to dissolve the legal, political, and economic bonds between peoples that creates two countries where there is now one. Self-determination and secession are, in the global establishment’s mind, synonymous with instability, chaos and bloodshed. And, yes, that is what has happened all too often when a dominant ethnic group has refused to recog-nize rights of a minority to a vote on sticking with the status quo or governing themselves in a new or different country. But chaos need not be the outcome of peo-ple exercising their right of self-determination. Ten years ago this week, voters in Monte-negro went to the polls in a referendum that posed the question, do you want Montenegro to be an independent state? When the votes were counted, 55.5 percent chose to peace-fully dissolve their union with Serbia. Shortly thereafter, all five members of the United Na-tions Security Council recognized the newest country in the world. In a region not known for a peaceful resolu-tion of disputes, the peoples of Serbia and Montenegro have written a praiseworthy chap-ter in the history of democratic government and self-determination. So what made it work so well this time? First and foremost, credit needs to be given to the Serbian government that permitted this ref-erendum to occur. By doing so, made force and violence unnecessary and even counter-productive in the cause of Montenegrin inde-pendence. Belgrade, which has made its share of bad decisions, should be praised for making the right decision—right for the people of Serbia and Montenegro. There are only a few examples of such an amiable separation. The Czech and Slovak split into two countries is certainly one exam-ple. We remember elections in Scotland and Quebec, where voters did not choose to be a new nation. Clearly it is better to let the future be determined by ballots, not bullets, and in such a democratic environment, fewer people will want to vote for a split. If a minority de-cides to go for it, it will not result in a far- reaching trauma and decades of dissolution and animosity. Today, for example, Montenegro is poised for a better future. It is advancing toward Euro-Atlantic integration, increasing its ability to fight organized crime and corruption, and strengthening its civil society and democratic structures. Yes, there are vexing problems, but with independence, the people of Monte-negro know they themselves will determine if Montenegro is to be on the right track. With such a dynamic in play, there is every reason for confidence that problems will be solved and the building of a better country will get done. As the chairman of the Europe, Eurasia, and Emerging Threats Subcommittee, I have followed the volatile situation in those areas that are under pressure from such nationalistic movements. Economic stagnation and corrup-tion feed the desire for self-determination and continue to be the biggest hurdle to devel-oping countries like Montenegro, even now when the people there are free to control their own destiny. Forging new standards for trans-parency and accountability should cut down and make all the difference in situations like this. Montenegro’s success in achieving mem-bership in the EU and NATO depends on it. The government of Montenegro now points to its macroeconomic predictability, educated workforce, and openness to incentivized tax structures to lure direct foreign investment and serve as fuel for economic progress. Their future is in their hands. Thus, they know they must act—or they lose. So after decades of being a backwater country, literally and figuratively, Montenegro is on the move. Stratex Group, for example, is now the largest American investor in Montenegro. The CEO was one of many Jewish families that fled So-viet Communism and settled in the United States. As Montenegro develops, more inter-national and domestic entrepreneurs, like Stratex, can be expected to take advantage of opportunities in this beautiful, free and inde-pendent country, opportunities brought on by the triumph of self-determination, sidelining conflict and corruption. The more success stories there are in the wake of amicable separation, the more peace-ful independent movements can be expected to emerge. New nations like Montenegro can be expected, and once in control of their own destiny, people in these new independent countries can be expected to prioritize critical reforms and educate their new generations about corruption, free enterprise, and demo-cratic government in the 21st century. I con-gratulate Montenegro on ten years of inde-pendence, and recommend others look to its experience as an example of gaining freedom and prosperity through self-determination.

TRIBUTE TO ABRAHAM SAENZ, JR. 
HON. HENRY CUELLAR 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, May 27, 2016 Mr. CUELLAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the retirement of Abraham Saenz, Jr., Council Member for the City of Pleasanton, Texas. He has proudly served the people of Pleasanton for 33 years. Mr. Saenz was born on June 27, 1931 in Lytle, Texas to Mr. Abraham Saenz, Sr. and Ms. Aurora Saenz. Mr. Saenz moved to Pleasanton, Texas in 1935 and attended Pleasanton High School. He joined the United States Air Force in 1952 and served in the Air Force Supply Unit until 1956. While in the Air Force, Mr. Saenz courageously served his country and fought in the Korean War. Following his years of service, Mr. Saenz returned to Pleasanton and opened a barber shop, which he owned and operated until 2014. During this time, Mr. Saenz was also a devoted community member. He was Scout Master for the Boy Scouts of America, Troop 194, a member of the Pleasanton Lion’s Club, and a member of the Atascosa County Eco-nomic Development Board. Mr. Saenz’s involvement in government began in the early 1980’s when he assisted Mr. Daniel Struve in his successful campaign for Texas State Representative. Mr. Saenz then pursued his own career in public service and was elected City Alderman for the city of Pleasanton on April 3, 1982. In 1984, the peo-ple of Pleasanton elected Mr. Saenz to serve as a member of the Pleasanton City Council, a position which he has proudly held for 33 years. During his tenure on the City Council, Mr. Saenz accomplished several important community developments, including the con-struction of a new public works and police de-partment building, the remodeling of the Pleasanton City Hall, the building of the Pleasanton Sports Complex, additions to the Pleasanton River Park, and construction of the Civic Center and Library. In addition to his exemplary career as an esteemed public servant, Abraham Saenz is a devoted husband to his wife, Ermelinda, and father to their four children. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to have the op-portunity to celebrate the successful career of Abraham Saenz, a patriotic American citizen, devoted city council member to Pleasanton, and a loving husband and father. f 
HONORING MS. DENISE JACKSON 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, May 27, 2016 Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Ms. Denise Jackson for her commitment as a volunteer for the George C. Yount Pioneer cemetery in Yountville, Cali-fornia. Ms. Jackson has been instrumental in main-taining the cemetery grounds and recording its long history. She took the initiative to become a volunteer grounds keeper a decade ago. With the support of her vineyard crew from her business, Colinas Farming Company, Ms. Jackson saw to it that the 16-acre cemetery stayed well-maintained. To enhance the historical records of the or-ganization, Ms. Jackson began a four-year project to survey the graves of 949 people laid to rest at the cemetery dating back to 1848. She led a team of 20 research volunteers and later archived this information online for de-scendants to trace their family history in Cali-fornia. She also published her findings in ‘‘Mapping the George C. Yount Pioneer Cem-etery’’ which she presented to the Napa Valley Genealogical Society. Ms. Jackson found the time to contribute to other community causes. As an extension of her decades of work as a registered dietitian, Ms. Jackson founded the Baby Nutrition Class at the Queen of the Valley Hospital and has a long history of supporting the American Heart Association where she currently serves as a board member. Ms. Jackson also chairs the Nutrition Committee of Napa County. Addi-tionally, she helps employees of the George C. Yount Pioneer cemetery with medical insur-ance claims. Mr. Speaker, Denise Jackson has selflessly spent her time and energy preserving the his-tory of the George C. Yount Pioneer cemetery and caring for the health and needs of others in her community. She has been a friend and mentor to many. Therefore, it is fitting and proper that we honor her here today. f 
IN RECOGNITION OF MAYOR WILSON KIRBY OF BERRYVILLE 
HON. BARBARA COMSTOCK 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, May 27, 2016 Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I am hon-ored to recognize and thank Mayor Wilson Kirby for his extraordinary leadership and service to the town of Berryville and its com-munity. Mayor Kirby moved to Berryville sixteen years ago, where he has since faithfully served the town first as a member of the Town Council and later as Mayor. Though he was new to the area, he immediately began dedicating himself to bettering the town and the lives of its citizens. With over 45 years of experience in engineering and consulting, Mayor Kirby was able to bring a unique per-spective to improving many of Berryville’s projects. He spearheaded a number of projects such as a new wastewater treatment plant, the construction of the new Clarke County High School, and the maintenance of the town’s secondary roads. These projects exemplify the hard work and time Mayor Kirby put into his town. His self-less desire to constantly improve Berryville never went unnoticed, least of all to his col-leagues in the town government. He held of-fice hours twice weekly to hear local concerns and other issues from Berryville citizens, al-ways understanding that the citizens of the town were of the utmost importance. A be-liever in a hands-on approach to governing, Mayor Kirby has helped make Berryville a truly wonderful town to visit, live in, and enjoy. From celebrating one hundredth birthdays of town members to lighting the town Christmas tree, Mayor Kirby has been an integral part of Berryville for the last 16 years. Berryville will be sad to see him leave office, but his legacy will continue. Today, we honor and celebrate the contributions he has made to the town of Berryville and all its citizens.
