OATH CEREMONY ON OCTOBER 12, 2018 
HON. PETER J. VISCLOSKY 
OF INDIANA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 12, 2018 Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure and sincerity that I take this time to congratulate thirty-one individuals who will take their oaths of citizenship on October 12, 2018. This memorable occasion will be held at the United States Courthouse and Federal Building in Hammond, Indiana. America is a country founded by immi-grants. From its beginning, settlers have come from countries around the world to the United States in search of better lives for their fami-lies. Oath ceremonies are a shining example of what is so great about the United States of America—that people from all over the world can come together and unite as members of a free, democratic nation. These individuals realize that nowhere else in the world offers a better opportunity for success than here in America. On October 12, 2018, the following people, representing many nations throughout the world, will take their oaths of citizenship in Hammond, Indiana: Wafa M. Shahin, Maher S. Isleem, Noor M. Isleem, Daniela Ivette Ponce, David Seo, Marianne Bushra Abdelmalak, Joana Maritza Grose, Monica Ying Williams, Atanacio Serrano, Charity Gross, Beatriz Cervantes, Esther Maria Arellano, Cedrick Dizala Mukinay, Wassim Shwaiki, Maria Flores De Leon, Evelin Yamilet Sanchez, Liza Safwat Assad, Miguel Angel Lima, Carmen Marquez, Thelma Alvarez Portney, Vic Dey, Audrey Harriette Gilbertsen, Manar Haddad, Alberto Lopez, Shirley Oduro- Nkansah, Hadja Fatimah Ouattara, Susana Rodriguez Perez, Kim Hoang Pham, Maria Guadalupe Rodriguez, Ramon Sandoval Jr., and Adriana Figueroa Trejo. Although each individual has sought to be-come a citizen of the United States for his or her own reasons, be it for education, occupa-tion, or to offer their loved ones better lives, each is inspired by the fact that the United States of America is, as Abraham Lincoln de-scribed it, a country ‘‘ . . . of the people, by the people, and for the people.’’ They realize that the United States is truly a free nation. By seeking American citizenship, they have made the decision that they want to live in a place where, as guaranteed by the First Amendment of the Constitution, they can practice religion as they choose, speak their minds without fear of punishment, and assemble in peaceful pro-test should they choose to do so. Mr. Speaker, I respectfully ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in congratulating these individuals who will be-come citizens of the United States of America on October 12, 2018. They, too, are American citizens, guaranteed the inalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. We, as a free and democratic nation, congratulate them and welcome them. IN HONOR OF NATHAN PRATT JENNINGS’S HEROIC ACTIONS HON. ADAM KINZINGER 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 12, 2018 Mr. KINZINGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and recognize Nathan Pratt Jennings, a Corporal in the Illinois Army National Guard and my constituent from Machesney Park, for his heroic actions in saving the life of his fel-low citizen. On August 3, 2018, Mr. Jennings was driv-ing home from work along Interstate 90 when out of the corner of his eye, he saw a big splash in a retention pond by the side of the road. Being an avid duck hunter, he knew that something was wrong. He pulled his car over and ran to the pond where he saw an upend-ed vehicle, rapidly sinking into the water. Mr. Jennings’ military training kicked in and he acted decisively, taking off his suit and jumping into the muddy water. After his first attempt to find the driver failed, he asked an-other individual to hold his feet while he dove into the submerged vehicle. After what felt like an eternity, he managed to find the driver and pulled her limp body from the car. As Mr. Jennings brought her to shore, he was certain she had drowned. Luckily, a group of Good Samaritans were waiting and ready to administer CPR until the paramedics arrived. While the others worked to save the life of the female driver, Mr. Jennings went back into the water to ensure that no one was left behind. Mr. Speaker, had it not been for Mr. Jen-nings’ quick actions, August 3rd could have ended tragically. I am glad to say that the driv-er of that car is alive and well thanks to Mr. Jennings and the other Good Samaritans who helped in her rescue. On behalf of Illinois’ 16th Congressional District, I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking Mr. Nathan Pratt Jennings for his heroic actions in saving the life of his fellow Illinoisan.

CONGRATULATING BOLTON VOL-UNTEER FIRE COMPANY ON ITS 100TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 12, 2018 Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and recognize the Bolton Volunteer Fire Company on its 100th Anniversary. Since its incorporation in 1918, the Bolton Volunteer Fire Company has upheld its mis-sion to provide fire protection and rescue serv-ices to the residents of Bolton, New York. Over the last 100 years, the fire company has made many improvements to its alerting meth-ods, truck models, and training systems to re-spond to the community’s evolving safety needs. Today, the company proactively en-gages the community through a variety of services, including a program to educate ele-mentary school students on fire safety and smoke detector advocacy campaigns. On behalf of New York’s 21st District, I want to congratulate the Bolton Volunteer Fire Com-pany on its 100 years of exceptional volunteer service and thank the firefighters for their dedi-cated commitment to keeping the Bolton com-munity safe. f 
HONORING GRANT HITCHCOCK 
HON. SAM GRAVES 
OF MISSOURI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 12, 2018 Mr. GRAVES. Mr. Speaker, I proudly pause to recognize Grant Hitchcock. Grant is a very special young man who has exemplified the finest qualities of citizenship and leadership by taking an active part in the Boy Scouts of America, Troop 1042, and earning the most prestigious award of Eagle Scout. Grant has been very active with his troop, participating in many scout activities. Over the many years Grant has been involved with scouting, he has not only earned numerous merit badges, but also the respect of his fam-ily, peers, and community. Most notably, Grant has become a member of the tribe Mic–O– Say. Grant has also contributed to his commu-nity through his Eagle Scout project. Grant re-furbished a large, multi-level deck and stairs at the Hope House in Lee’s Summit, Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I proudly ask you to join me in commending Grant Hitchcock for his accom-plishments with the Boy Scouts of America and for his efforts put forth in achieving the highest distinction of Eagle Scout.

IN MEMORY OF ALEX SPANOS 
HON. DARRELL E. ISSA 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 12, 2018 Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Alexander Gus Spanos, who passed away at the age of 95 this week. A native Californian, Alex was well known for his skillful business acumen and his gen-erous philanthropy. He is perhaps best known for founding one of the largest apartment de-velopers in the United States, A.G. Spanos Companies, as well as serving as the owner of the Chargers NFL Franchise. Born the son of Greek immigrants in Stock-ton, California in 1923, Alex’s tireless work ethic and boldness was instilled in him at a very young age, when he began working in his father’s bakery at the age of eight. A tough upbringing coupled with the unshakeable be-lief that he could accomplish anything he set his mind to continuously drove Alex to suc-ceed and overcome countless obstacles.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD —Extensions of RemarksE1392 October 12, 2018 
Alex was a proud American who truly lived the American Dream and loved the country that enabled him to live it. When World War II broke out, Alex left college to join the U.S. Army Air Corps, where he served as a B–29 tail gunner. After the war, Alex returned to school and earned varsity letters in both swim-ming and diving at the College of the Pacific in Stockton. In 1951, Alex started a small business sell-ing sandwiches to migrant workers in the San Joaquin Valley. Four years after starting this business, Alex made his first million dollars and began investing his earnings in real estate and started to build apartments. In 1960, he founded A.G. Spanos Companies that, within the following two decades, became the largest apartment builder in the United States. Always an enthusiast for sports and athletic activity, Alex fulfilled one of his lifelong goals in 1984, when he purchased the San Diego Chargers. One his most memorable moments as the owner of the Chargers was watching them defeat the Pittsburgh Steelers to play in Super Bowl XXIX in 1995. Being equally passionate about the Char-gers franchise’s impact off the field, Alex cre-ated and funded community outreach pro-grams like the Chargers Community Founda-tion, that continues to exist, supporting numer-ous critical causes, individuals in need, and organizations that benefit the Southern Cali-fornia community. Alex was a creative entrepreneur, who also knew how to conduct business the right way, firmly establishing an honest and forthright reputation in both his personal and profes-sional relationships. For many years, I had the honor and privilege of knowing Alex and his beloved wife Faye, who also passed away earlier this year. He was always the consum-mate gentleman, who consistently worked to give back to the country that had given him so much and I was always grateful for his coun-sel and friendship. Alex Spanos was a beloved pillar of our California community and will be greatly missed, but his legacy will undoubtedly live on for many generations to come. With his pass-ing, Mr. Speaker, please join me in honoring the legacy of this exemplary citizen and proud patriot, who lived a life that should serve as an inspiration to us all.

HONORING AND REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF JAMES FARRINGTON 
HON. JACK BERGMAN 
OF MICHIGAN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 12, 2018 Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, it’s my privi-lege today to honor the life of a dedicated community leader and loving husband, James Farrington, who passed away at the age of 51 after decades of service to Northern Michigan. Through his extreme courage and selfless-ness, James became an indispensable part of Michigan’s First District. A native of Lansing, James dedicated his life to fellow Michiganders. After beginning his career with the Lansing Board of Water and Light, James spent 10 years as a journeyman lineworker at Traverse City Light and Power prior to joining Consumers Energy. He was well-known for his expertise, willingness to mentor others, and love for his work. It takes years of study and experience to be a journey-man lineworker, and the tremendous physical stamina and knowledge necessary to do this vital work demands respect and appreciation from our community. James braved hazardous conditions and unforgiving weather to ensure that members of his community had access to reliable electricity—a matter of life and death for many in Northern Michigan. As we look for solace after this tragedy, I want to express my heartfelt condolences to his family and friends. James’ tireless devotion to the public good has touched the lives of countless Michiganders, and the impact of his work can-not be overstated. Mr. Speaker, James Farrington’s family and community can take pride in knowing that Northern Michigan is a better place thanks to his life’s work. On behalf of Michigan’s First Congressional District, I ask you to join me in honoring the life of an outstanding community leader whose contributions will continue to bless Michiganders for many years to come. f

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF KENNETH ANTONIO ‘‘TONY’’ COXEY 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 12, 2018 Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of a man that dedi-cated himself to this country and the people of Mississippi. Kenneth Antonio ‘‘Tony’’ Coxey, a native of Monroe County Mississippi, passed away on Monday, September 24, 2018. Tony graduated from Smithville High School in 1994. In April of 1996, at the age of 20, he decided to join the Mississippi Army National Guard. He proudly served this country for over 20 years. In 1999, Tony joined the Amory Po-lice Department and began his career in law enforcement. He was a devoted patrolman for the city of Amory, as well as a part-time pa-trolman with the Smithville Police Department. Tony’s law enforcement career was inter-rupted in 2004 when he received his orders to serve our nation in Operation Iraqi Freedom. After serving for 18 months in Fallujah, Iraq, with the 155th Armored Brigade Combat Team, Tony returned home to serve as a road deputy with the Monroe County Sheriff’s Of-fice. He later transferred to the Narcotics Divi-sion and became a Lieutenant. Tony returned to Iraq from 2009–2010 as Personal Security Detachment for Colonel Wil-liam ‘‘Bill’’ Glasgow. In 2011, he deployed to NATO (Bosnia) as Personal Security Detach-ment for General Gary E. Huffman. Shortly after, Tony retired from the Mississippi Army National Guard as an SFC E–7. After his final deployment, Tony returned home and began working for the Alabama and Gulf Coast Railway. While working, Tony was involved in a serious train accident that left him fighting for his life. With the help of God and against all odds, Tony made a remarkable recovery. He used this accident to tell his story about how God pulled him through to anyone that would listen.

HONORING THE 25TH SEASON OF THE SYRACUSE CRUNCH 
HON. JOHN KATKO 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 12, 2018 Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the Syracuse Crunch’s 25th season playing in Syracuse. The Crunch com-pete in the American Hockey League, which is the top developmental league for the National Hockey League, and play their home games at the historic Oncenter War Memorial Arena on South State Street. Since relocating to Syr-acuse in 1994, the Crunch have served as the primary affiliate for five different National Hockey League franchises. The Syracuse Crunch traces its franchise roots back to 1992, when they were originally the Hamilton Canucks based in Hamilton, On-tario. After two seasons in Hamilton, the Ca-nucks were relocated to Syracuse and re-named the Crunch by a public vote. The Crunch were immediately popular in their new city and led the league in sellouts during two of their first four seasons in Syracuse. In addi-tion, the team was successful upon relocation to Syracuse and reached the playoffs three consecutive years after failing to qualify in their inaugural season. During the 2010s, the Crunch established themselves as an iconic American Hockey League franchise. The team won two con-ference championships during the 2012–2013 and 2016–2017 campaigns and reached the Calder Cup Finals. The Crunch fell short in both appearances, losing to the Grand Rapids Griffins on both occasions. Additionally, they participated in the league’s first ever outdoor game at the Grandstand at the New York State Fairgrounds in 2010. The Crunch won the contest over the Binghamton Senators by a score of 2–1 and set a league record for sin-gle-game attendance with 21,508 spectators. Four years later, the Crunch rewrote the his-tory books again when they played the Utica Comets at the Carrier Dome in Syracuse. The attendance of 30,715 fans for their 2–1 win over Utica was the largest crowd for an indoor hockey game in the United States. The Crunch have been the top affiliate of the Tampa Bay Lightning since 2012. They have developed several star players for the Lightning, including Andrei Vasilevskiy, Nikita Kucherov and Yanni Gourde. They also have developed geographic rivalries with several other upstate New York teams located in Rochester, Binghamton and Utica, which has contributed to the popularity of hockey in the region. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the House join me in celebrating the Syracuse Crunch’s rich history in Central New York. The Crunch have long contributed to the identity of Syracuse and culture of hockey in the area. As a co-chair of the Congressional Hockey Caucus, I am grateful for their presence in Syracuse. f 
CELEBRATING HABERSHAM COUN-TY’S BICENTENNIAL ANNIVER-SARY 
HON. DOUG COLLINS 
OF GEORGIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 12, 2018 Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 200th Anniversary of Habersham County, Georgia. Habersham County rests in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, in the northeast corner of Georgia, and was established on December 15, 1818. The county is named for Colonel Joseph Habersham, who was an offi-cer of the Continental Army during the Revolu-tionary War, President George Washington’s Postmaster General, and a mayor of Savan-nah. Habersham County’s beauty extends from scenic Tallulah Gorge in the north, where The Flying Wallendas crossed on high wire, to se-rene Lake Russell in the south. People ven-ture from far and wide to Habersham to enjoy the National Forest and the world class fly fishing on the Soque and Chattahoochee Riv-ers. It is a truly special place that I am blessed to represent. The only thing that outshines Habersham County’s beauty is its community. You can al-ways feel the warmth and welcome of the people, whether it’s having breakfast at the Crossroads Cafe´, celebrating our Appalachian heritage at the Chattahoochee Mountain Fair, or watching the Raiders football win on a Fri-day night. I celebrate Habersham County’s two cen-turies of rich history and wish the citizens of Habersham County a joyful year ahead.

A HAPPY DOUBLE TEN DAY TO THE PEOPLE OF TAIWAN 
HON. STEVE KING 
OF IOWA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 12, 2018 Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, Wednes-day, October 10th is Taiwan’s National Day— also known as Double Ten Day. I would like to take this opportunity now to offer my best wishes to the people of Taiwan. As my colleagues are aware, Taiwan is a close friend, as well as security and trade partner of the United States. This year, I was happy to cosponsor and vote for H.R. 535, the Taiwan Travel Act. And I was even happier to see the bill pass the House, the Senate and be signed into law by President Trump on March 16, 2018. This important law expresses the sense of Congress that the United States Government should encourage visits between officials from the United States and Taiwan at all levels. Furthermore, it states it should be U.S. policy to allow U.S. officials to travel to Taiwan to meet their Taiwanese counterparts; permit high-level Taiwanese officials to enter the U.S. to meet with U.S. officials; and en-courages the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office (TECRO) to conduct business in the United States. Mr. Speaker, I could not agree more with this policy. In my home state of Iowa, we are enthusi-astic to build on our already strong trade ties. Just this past September, Taiwan renewed its pledge to purchase a total of up to 3.9 million metric tons of soybeans valued at up to $1.56 billion in 2018 and 2019. Under the revised deal, the U.S. share of soybeans purchased by Taiwan will increase to between 80% and 90% of total Taiwanese purchases. It was also announced that the new agreement with Tai-wan will result in 75% of Taiwan’s total soy-bean purchases coming from Iowa. As President Trump’s Administration scans the globe looking for bilateral trade partners, Taiwan holds as much promise as ever for the U.S. Iowa and every state in the nation would benefit from the signing of a free trade agree-ment between Taiwan and the U.S., which would eliminate tariffs on most products and increase Taiwanese demand and Iowa ex-ports. Though a small country with a popu-lation of 23.5 million, Taiwan has the potential to become a strong export market for Iowa and the U.S. Taiwan is a major importer of our nation’s agriculture missions to the U.S. Other sectors such as Iowa’s strong wind energy sector have potential for bilateral cooperation as well. Mr. Speaker, again, I wish the people of Taiwan a Happy Double Ten Day. And I take this opportunity to once again echo the words of Barry Goldwater when he said, ‘‘I have great affection for the Chinese people, their culture, their skills, and their potential.’’ f

OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 12, 2018 Mr. VELA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Dr. James P. Allison and his pio-neering cancer research. Dr. Allison was awarded the 2018 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for developing a new effective al-ternative cancer treatment, which targets the immune system instead of individual tumors.

He completed his postdoctoral fellowship at the California-based Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation (1974–1977). Dr. Allison served as a faculty member at renowned institutions, including the University of Texas System Cancer Center (1977–1984), the University of California, Berkeley (1985–2004), and the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York (2004–2012). As a professor at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center since 2012, Dr. Allison is a leading expert both inside and out-side of the classroom. His students look up to

Mr. Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to honor Dr. James P. Allison of South Texas for his contributions to cancer research. I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking Dr. Alli-son for his life-changing work and congratu-lating him in advance of the Nobel ceremonies in December.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 12, 2018 Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the service of Mr. Michael E. Lufsey and his long and honorable govern-ment contract career. Mr. Lufsey has honored his country with over 40 years of service in graphic support and design, demonstrating not only skill at his craft, but devotion to our na-tion. Before his career in government contracting, ‘‘Mike’’ graduated from Douglas Freeman High School in 1968 in Henrico, Virginia. Two years later, he served with the United States Coast Guard for a brief, two-month stint before re-ceiving a medical discharge. In June 1977, Mr. Lufsey provided govern-ment contractor services with Magnavox Gov-ernment and Industrial Corporation as a tech-nical illustrator. With Magnavox, he assisted with computer graphic support to Department of Defense clients, developing military tech-nical training manuals. In November 1992, Mike transitioned to TAD Technical Services, working as a Graphic Artist and providing graphic support for technology companies like IBM and JAYCOR. By August of 1993, Mr. Lufsey was the Senior Graphic Artist and Illus-trator at Coleman Research Corporation where he provided graphic support for the De-partment of Energy on training presentations, briefings, and Department plans. In September 1997, Mr. Lufsey became a Principle Designer with Anteon Corporation (later General Dynamics). In this capacity, he performed briefing support services and maga-zine development for three Navy Flag Officers. He also produced large scale posters which were placed onboard the USS Ramage for tours conducted at the Army/Navy game in December 2008. For the past 21 years, Mr. Lufsey has served a contract with ECS (formerly Para-digm) and has continued to support the mis-sion of the Missile Defense Agency and Aegis Missile Defense as a graphic designer. Throughout his prestigious career, Mr. Lufsey has received acclamations from satisfied cli-ents and grateful organizations including let-ters of appreciation from four Rear Admirals, commendations from the Scientific Advisory Board, and the Theater Surface Combatants Unit Award for Excellence. Mr. Speaker, I ask you to join me in recog-nizing Mr. Michael Lufsey’s lifetime of accom-plishment and dedication. An admirable illus-tration of leadership and service, and an out-standing member of our community, may God bless Mr. Lufsey and his family as he con-tinues to be an example of service and com-mitment. On behalf of America’s First District, we say thank you. f 
CONSTITUENT COMMENTS ON SOBER LIVING HOME PROBLEMS 
HON. DANA ROHRABACHER 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 12, 2018 Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, I rise again regarding the hearing held by the Judici-ary Subcommittee on the Constitution and Civil Justice on September 28, 2018 on the issue of sober living homes. At that hearing, I had the privilege of testifying at that hearing in support of my bill, H.R. 5724, to restore local oversight over sober living homes. As part of my testimony, I submitted to the Sub-committee letters from many of my constitu-ents about problems with sober living homes caused by current federal law preventing ap-propriate local oversight. For the benefit of my colleagues and the American people. I include in the R
ECORD the third group of these con-stituent letters: 
As an ER nurse and a mom, I taught my children the dangers of drugs and thought I would never have issues. At 17, my high func-tioning autistic child was addicted to mari-juana. I sent him to wilderness camp, rehab centers and nothing worked. At 18, I made a decision to put him into a sober living home thinking he would learn life skills and to be clean. Instead, he learned that if he would fail sober living and go to a rehab center he was eligible for a grant of $3000 and he could keep $1000 but the guy who was setting it up would keep the rest. His job is to recruit peo-ple to fail at sober living to obtain grants. Luckily for us, my child had the fear of never being able to live at home. I have seen at least 100 patients from SLH test positive for substances even hiding small shampoo bottles inside body cavities with other peo-ple’s urine to use for testing. Recruit to CA for more money in benefits is what they are told. Then they are stuck here. I see patients that are here from Maryland, Texas, Ne-braska, and Florida. They were brought here for rehab, went into sober living home and now are homeless, addicts, with no money to get home. M

My wife and I have lived in our home for 29 years and raised our kids here. It was a quiet residential neighborhood up until approxi-mately a couple of months ago when a sober living home moved in four doors down from us. Since then I have witnessed numerous oc-casions when armed police officers and pa-role officials have had to come to the sober living home to talk with the residents. This August at approximately 1:30 a.m. there were three individuals captured on numerous neighborhood surveillance cameras cooking up heroine, jumping over fences and trying to enter the homes of my neighbors as police officers tried to apprehend them. Needless to say, as these drug people were just outside my home, my wife and I were very upset! On another occasion one of the sober living home residents had one of their pit bull dogs loose and on the street barking and terror-izing the neighbors. Thankfully the dog catcher was able to apprehend them before someone got hurt or bit! Treatment centers are needed, BUT not in a family residential neighborhood! Please help us regain our neighborhood! ALANOSTERHOUT , Huntington Beach, California. 
Ever since the detox/sober living home opened IN our neighborhood, our lives have never been the same. Loud and obnoxious music, nonstop barking dogs, day and night. Cars and people in and out of the house at all hours. There’s been incidents of them trying to break in to people’s homes, running through our yards at night, doing heroin in the street corner and one exposing himself to a child. All this in a neighborhood full of hardworking and law-abiding families and less than fifty feet from a middle school. There is something terribly wrong when the government fails us at all levels. The fact that we pay taxes should count for some-thing, especially when it comes to protecting our families. If something isn’t done soon, I’m afraid there won’t be any turning back. You need to implement rules, regulations and laws that will prohibit these unscrupu-lous places from invading our neighborhoods. These are for-profit places, money is their goal. The characters running these places are shady, we know for a fact that several of them are in probation and all the activity described above is substantiated by video footage. I’m pleading with you to please save our families and our neighborhoods. M
ANUELA ALMEIDA , Huntington Beach, California. 
The purpose of this letter is to be among the several with growing concerns over the establishment of a Sober Living Home in our community. My wife and I live on [AD-DRESS], next to [REDACTED] Elementary in Huntington Beach. A Sober Living Home was recently established at the end of our block. Since that time our neighborhood has undergone a sweeping change in way in which we conduct our day-to-day activities. We have noticed a marked increase in the number of people who are not members of our neighborhood, simply walking the street. At first, this does not sound too ominous. Then we add in the number of cars, not from the local area that are driving very slowly up and down our street. Please remember that we are located within 300 feet of an ac-tive Middle School. These are not the cars of parents picking up their children as school starts on September 5 for them. These are not people who are lost or looking for an ad-dress. These are people who seem to stop and start in front of the Sober Living House. There are people at all hours of the night that seem to open the trunk of a car and put something in; or, take something out of the car and then carry on down the street. This is all documented and supported with foot-age from local household security cameras. My curiosity rose to the highest level of concern when on Friday morning, August 24 at 1:30 AM, I was startled by unusual noises outside the front of my house, where my bed-room window is located. I looked outside the shutters only to find two strangers at my window. Please take notice that my bedroom window is 30 feet or a full driveway length off the street. These two were prowling in front of my bedroom where my wife and I were sleeping. I ran to the front door, which is always locked and chained, turned on the porch light to startle and scare them off. My wife shouted we were calling the police and indicated we had a gun. I also have the RING security doorbell/camera. I activated it im-mediately so that I could observe their re-sponse. The video shows two male figures ap-proaching my front door and then turning

and leaving. We called the Huntington Beach police department who immediately dis-patched a patrol car. The car was seen driv-ing up and around our neighborhood. My wife notified other members of our neighborhood watch group and communication between neighbors began quickly. We learned that other people had similar occurrences, includ-ing one neighbor who had his house invaded by them. They apparently entered a house, saw the occupant, turned and fled. My wife and I eventually spoke with a po-lice officer at 2:30 AM after placing a second call to the department. During our ‘‘inter-view’’ the officer informed us that they were looking for two adults, one male and one fe-male. We reported two males. Therefore, it turns out there were three people involved in this event. The officer informed us that the Sober Living Home was NOT involved. Strangely enough, after several members of our neighborhood became involved and checked their security cameras, the group of two and three were seen crossing the back-yards of several homes in the neighborhood, entering and exiting the Sober Living House where, it was documented, they may have lived, or visited frequently. We were then able to piece together a complete story that involved these three being involved in drug transportation and use (witnessed by resi-dents), the police and police helicopter called in to apprehend, the suspects crossing through several backyards and, as previously stated, entering a neighborhood home while the resident was there. Remember, the police said members of the Sober Living House were not involved, yet quite clearly, they were. While I understand the local police would like to control the situation, I find it appall-ing that they believe that dis-information and mis-information is the best way to pro-ceed. A neighborhood meeting was called over this event. A local member of our com-munity volunteered their house for the meeting. I attended it and sat quietly. I learned of parents that are afraid to let their child walk the quiet neighborhood block to school, I heard of the large number of house-holds that have invested in security cameras for their homes. My wife and I are among them. I now have enhanced security lights and cameras in both my front and back yards. Neighbors that are now keeping fire-arms more readily accessible to assist in the unfortunate case of a perfect stranger simply entering a home where they do not belong. On an incredibly personal level, there are times when I am called out of town. This past weekend was one such time. For the first time in my twenty-eight-year marriage and my wife’s 58 years on this planet, she felt the need to sleep with a loaded gun next to our bed. This must be unacceptable and yet it is becoming essential to our well- being. My distress rose to the point of anger to find that the people using the noble cause of establishing a Sober Living Environment had criminal records, were under investiga-tion for conning older people out of money for bogus investment opportunities and, while all this is documented, nobody can do anything about it. We are told that if the Sober Living Homes are small enough, they can exist virtually unregulated, yet incred-ibly well-funded by insurance companies. Local governments are frustrated while State governments contribute to the prob-lem by ignoring the possibility of corruption and challenges they permit by not regulating the environment they created. When ‘‘clean’’ urine is dropped off to make sure residents can pass random drug tests, not much con-fidence can develop in the system. Mr. Peterson [Mayor Pro Tempore, Hun-tington Beach] I have been informed that you will be speaking before a U.S. House committee about establishing some federal guidelines over these communities. Please believe that while I want every individual to have a legitimate second chance, and I un-derstand that might mean some might have to exist in my neighborhood, I do not believe that an entire community should be told by a Limited Liability Corporation with an in-visible manager that the entire community must sacrifice their safety, their security, their way of life simply because a corpora-tion does not have to follow any rules, be-cause no real rules exist. While we might look at local legislation on a city level, there is great difficulty to do this because the State of California does not support the efforts of its citizenry and the local communities they are supposed to be in service of. As one of the members of our city council and as someone that has been asked to speak before the House Subcommittee, I would like to add our names to the many that are in search of help from our elected officials. We helped put you in your position conditioned on the promise you would look out for us. You will be speaking with other people put into that same position but on a larger stage. Please make sure our voices are heard and that some positive outcome from this is to be reasonably expected. The wheels of government move slowing on a national level when only a neighborhood is involved; however, since there are neighborhoods across California and some other States with similar issues, I am hoping this develops into an issue of prominence. I/we are counting on you to make that happen. Please feel free to reach out to myself or any of the many members of our community and others for additional information or per-spective. We, the citizens of your community are looking forward to your report. We hope you will make the substance of your experi-ence available to us all. J

Since owning a home in 2008, I have yet to NOT live next to a sober living home. In Costa Mesa, I lived next to two. One next door and one across the street. In Hun-tington Beach, I live next to one which is lo-cated directly across the street. I am married and have three small boys ages seven, five and three. They rarely go outside in the front yard due to the sober liv-ing homes. Crime is ever present, drug nee-dles found on the street, relapses, a near con-stant stream of cars coming and going and my son almost getting hit by these people speeding. They are a business and need to be treated as such. There should be regulations on how many per community, how close to one an-other as well as how close to a school. I’m all for recovery but my issue is the owners who don’t care about many of these people trying to recover. Why not set up in a business park? The owners use our commu-nities as profit to their business, could care less about investing in the community and make a lot of money with the aid of insur-ance. I don’t understand how insurance con-tinues to pay these homes. These are businesses and need to be treated as such and not be in a residential commu-nity affecting kids, families and its resi-dents. S
EANCROSON , Huntington Beach, California. 
I have lived in many and managed one sober living house in my lifetime. I have also worked at two licensed facilities specializing in addiction treatment. The fact is a sober house is a landlord renting rooms to individ-uals. Attempting to regulate housing based on how it is marketed or to whom it is mar-keted is not a direction I would be com-fortable seeing my community take. If it succeeded, it would increase the number of homeless addicts on the street. Yes, many people with money or insurance do come to rehab in licensed facilities. I find it difficult to believe that people coming from other areas for a determined number of days who have insurance or the many thousands per month that rehab costs are contributing sig-nificantly to the number of homeless addicts on the street. People may not like addicts living near them. Who would? But people might not like a commune of musicians or a group of loud teenagers moving in next to them either. They must be handled in the same manner: the way one would handle an annoying neighbor. What is being proposed sounds preposterous to me and trust me when I say the community will regret it if all those people must suddenly find some-where else to live. What will we do next? Ask the police to become more aggressive until more people get killed for no reason? TONYKAZ, Huntington Beach, California. 
There were two sober living/recovery homes on my elderly mother’s street. I say ‘‘were’’ because they turned out to be a total nightmare and thankfully a councilman was instrumental in helping to get them re-moved. The street is [REDACTED], and not until a young man died, did much change from the needles in neighbors’ yards to un-ruly situations, etc. Needless to say, it was very unsettling and a shame that someone had to die in order for major change to hap-pen. We now have a few in our neighborhood and one is 2 blocks away. It is on [AD-DRESS]. There have been a few incidents al-ready involving that house. Hopefully we can do something to have some accountability for these businesses. Common sense needs to prevail! Thank you for what you can do. S
HERRIE WOLFE , Huntington Beach, California. 
I strongly request that provisions be en-acted to regulate the growth of large and small sober living and detox facilities estab-lishing locations in residential communities. Located on my street, less than 100 yards from a middle school is an SLH/detox facil-ity that recently opened its doors. In the past 30 days, curbside drug consumption, at-tempted and successful B & E, unleashed dog complaints and drug sales have been docu-mented less than 100 yards from the middle school. Evidence was video-taped and filed with the local police, city council members and the city attorney. Absolutely nothing can be done by these ‘‘protective’’ officials by their own admissions as documented in their emails to residents of our neighbor-hood. The message is that there are no en-forceable guidelines for them to follow. There is a ground swell of very concerned and scared residents and families banding to-gether to create a self-protecting group which I feel is a poor workaround to the pro-tection that we should be provided from our police and local government. I implore you to expeditiously enact legis-lation that will provide a process to evaluate and approve Sober Living and Detox facili-ties in residential areas. These are health care facilities that need to adhere to a fair and reasonable standard work process. The process must provide our police and govern-ment officials a path to systematically evaluate complaints and apply corrective ac-tion rapidly if needed. I have researched and learned that the State of Florida and the City of Costa Mesa, California have implemented legislation that has been successful at sorting out good oper-ators from those that are not utilizing a fair

and balanced method of initial approval and operational evaluation. Please work to make this a bi-partisan ef-fort as political preference has absolutely nothing to do with what is needed. Respect-fully submitted. L
ESLIE WANNALL , Huntington Beach, California. 
As a result of the recent opening of a detox sober living home in my neighborhood, my family has experienced many negative con-sequences. Last week, my teenage son heard noises outside his bedroom window and dis-covered two members of the sober living home were cooking heroin on the back of his car, shooting up and attempting to sell her-oin. The amount of traffic on our street from people cruising by the home all night long keeps our family up at night. Many nights there are helicopters overhead for several hours, which also affects our sleep. In addi-tion, this home has two pit bulls that have been outside off leash, barking angrily at all who walk by. These dogs are left outside in the backyard and bark all night. We have seen camera footage of members of this home breaking into my neighbors’ homes. This particular home, [REDACTED], is run by an ex-convict as a 10-bed facility when the law states 6 beds is the maximum allowed in a residential area. Down the street is a mid-dle school. It is unacceptable and unsafe to have this type of home in our neighborhood. Several neighbors are choosing to move but we shouldn’t have to move to maintain our safety and quality of life. I implore you to please take this matter seriously. In addi-tion, if people are truly seeking to detox from drugs and alcohol, this is not a suitable environment to support sobriety. Thank you for your consideration, S

HONORING JEREMIAH DAVID THORNTON, JR. 
HON. SAM GRAVES 
OF MISSOURI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 12, 2018 Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I proudly pause to recognize Jeremiah Thorn-ton, Jr. Jeremiah is a very special young man who has exemplified the finest qualities of citi-zenship and leadership by taking an active part in the Boy Scouts of America, Troop 333, and earning the most prestigious award of Eagle Scout. Jeremiah has been very active with his troop, participating in many scout activities. Over the many years Jeremiah has been in-volved with scouting, he has not only earned numerous merit badges, but also the respect of his famiiy, peers, and community. Most no-tably, Jeremiah has become a Fire Builder in the tribe Mic-o-Say. Jeremiah has also contrib-uted to his community through his Eagle Scout project. Jeremiah refurbished a house in Park-ville that is used during the Christmas season for Santa to meet with children. Mr. Speaker, I proudly ask you to join me in commending Jeremiah for his accomplish-ments with the Boy Scouts of America and for his efforts put forth in achieving the highest distinction of Eagle Scout. HONORING THE SERVICE OF VIRGIL RYALS HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 12, 2018 Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the service of Virgil Ryals. Mr. Ryals is a Korean War veteran who served the United States of America honorably. Virgil was born in Winters, California, and his family later relocated to Chowchilla. After graduating from Chowchilla High, he joined the U.S. Army in Januaty 1951. Com-pleting his basic training at Fort Ord, Virgil was assigned to a unit with the 6th Army. In the summer of 1951, he sojourned with his Army companions to Pusan, South Korea where he joined the 1st Cavalry Division. Shortly afterward he was assigned to Com-pany C of the 7th Cavalry, the infamous ‘‘Garry Owen’’ regiment once led by George Armstrong Custer. Virgil was assigned to a radio section of Headquarters Company where he received and transmitted vitally important intelligence to embattled Army units. Virgil’s hard work and quick learning was quickly noticed by his su-periors, and Virgil was soon promoted to head the section. In October 1951, Virgil’s commu-nicators kept all units in contact when a Chi-nese counterattack threatened to overrun the regiment. Virgil served on occupation duty in Japan until December 1952, when he returned home on leave to visit his family. At the end of his leave, Virgil and his family were involved in a tragic car accident which claimed the life of both his parents. Virgil, suffering from two bro-ken legs, a broken elbow and numerous other injuries, was not expected to live. But, for the next eleven months, Virgil underwent several procedures at Letterman’s Hospital where he fought to recover. In November 1953, Corporal Virgil Ryals was honorably discharged from the United States Army. For his service, he was awarded the National Defense Service Medal, the Good Conduct Medal, the Army of Occupation Medal (Japan), the Korean Service Medal with three Bronze Stars, the United Nations Serv-ice Medal, and the Combat Infantryman’s Badge. Virgil worked as a dairyman and farmer until 1959 when he accepted a position at the Chowchilla Post Office, where he worked for thirty-one years. Mention the name of Virgil Ryals to virtually anyone in Chowchilla and they will know the congenial, chatty, helpful postal worker who helped generations of Chowchillans. His wife, Eva, passed away in 1999. They raised two beautiful children and have one grandchild. Virgil is a Life Member of Chowchilla VFW Post 9896, American Legion Post 148, and a member of St. Columba Church. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to the service of Virgil Ryals for his dedication to his family and his country. HONORING 2018 BARROW COUNTY REACH RECIPIENTS HON. JODY B. HICE 
OF GEORGIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 12, 2018 Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to congratulate Dylan Ceraso, Jeanna Presley, Alejandro Tovar-Villagomez, and Morgan Watkins for being selected as 2018 REACH Scholars for Barrow County, Georgia. Standing for ‘‘Realizing Educational Achievement Can Happen,’’ this needs-based mentorship and college scholarship program provides opportunity for academically-prom-ising students from their eighth grade year through high school. In addition to remaining in high academic standing, students are re-quired to meet with a mentor and maintain good attendance. Upon graduation from high school and successful completion of the pro-gram, the student is awarded a $10,000 schol-arship toward the cost of any HOPE-eligible institution in Georgia. These REACH Georgia scholars are our fu-ture. Georgia has made a commitment to awarding those in need who demonstrate a high level of merit—an investment that will in-crease our workforce and grow our economy. I’m proud that we take these steps to ensure a brighter future for our children, our state, and our Nation. Mr. Speaker, I expect great things from each of these special young scholars, and on behalf of Georgia’s 10th Congressional Dis-trict, I offer them my congratulations and wish them continued success.

IN RECOGNITION OF DR. MARLA GUERRA’S RETIREMENT 
HON. FILEMON VELA 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 12, 2018 Mr. VELA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Dr. Marla M. Guerra, a dedicated ed-ucator who is retiring after 17 years of service as the superintendent of South Texas Inde-pendent School District (ISD). Dr. Guerra’s professional accomplishments are numerous and impressive. She has pas-sionately guided South Texas ISD, continu-ously improving the quality of education, and earning state and national recognitions along the way. Under her leadership, South Texas ISD was recognized first in Texas, and sixth in the nation in the Niche 2018 category for ‘‘Best K–12 School Districts.’’ Dr. Guerra was also named the 2018 Texas Association of School Boards’ Regional Superintendent of the Year. Dr. Guerra is an influential educator with a strong focus on educational growth for student development.

Prior to her role as superintendent of South Texas ISD, Dr. Guerra served as a teacher, principal, and college professor. She was also a social worker and worked alongside Child Protective Services. Dr. Guerra is a true champion for our youth, and her success has unequivocally empowered them to improve themselves and their communities. As a leader and advocate for our children, Dr. Guerra has molded South Texas ISD into the district it is today. Mr. Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to join me in congratulating Dr. Marla M. Guerra for her more than 40 years of public service for our children and schools.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 12, 2018 Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and recognize Ruthie’s Run on its 50th Anniversary. A visit to Lake Placid, New York, is not complete without a stop at Ruthie’s Run, the iconic sportswear and skiwear shop. Ruthie’s Run has offered a wide variety of skiing goods since Ruth Prime purchased Thaire’s Ski Shop in 1968 and renamed it after a slope on Aspen Mountain in Colorado. In 1984, Cathy and Wayne Johnston left their jobs in the corporate world and bought Ruthie’s Run to make their own mark in the community, and they have maintained quality service ever since. Ruthie’s Run offers a se-lection for customers looking for a wide variety of price range and style. With Cathy’s exper-tise to solve any wardrobe issue, customers never leave Ruthie’s unsatisfied. On behalf of New York’s 21st District, I want to congratulate Ruthie’s Run on its 50th anni-versary. Ruthie’s is a staple in the Lake Placid community, and I look forward to watching the Johnstons continue its legacy in the years to come. f 
CONGRATULATING THE PUERTO RICAN BAR ASSOCIATION 
HON. NYDIA M. VELA´ZQUEZ 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 12, 2018 Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to extend my congratulations to the Puerto Rican Bar Association, as it celebrates its 40th Year Anniversary Scholarship Fund Gala on October 12, 2018. The Puerto Rican Bar Association (PRBA) was founded in 1957. It is the largest Latino bar association in New York State and offers personal and professional support to Puerto Rican and Latino attorneys. The PRBA Schol-arship Fund raises money to award scholar-ships to deserving law students. Founded in 1978 by Justice Donald Grajales, himself a past president of the PRBA, it has provided over $500,000,000 to law students based on scholastic achievement, community involve-ment and financial need. The lawyers who make up PRBA have a strong dedication to public service and to pre-serving the civil and political rights of Puerto Ricans and Latinos. This has been an extraor-dinary year in which the PRBA has been presente! I am proud of all the members who volunteered and dedicated time and resources to help the victims of Hurricane Maria in Puer-to Rico, the detained children and hardworking families in New York City. One thing is for certain, the members of PRBA have an unwavering commitment to the legal profession, to each other and to the peo-ple they serve. I want to especially thank Car-men Pacheco, Esq., for her dedication and leadership during her term as President and congratulate Honorable Wilma Guzman, the first judge ever elected President of the Puerto Rican Bar Association. I am confident that her experience, vision and leadership will propel the association to new heights. Mr. Speaker, please join me in congratu-lating the Puerto Rican Bar Association and the Puerto Rican Bar Scholarship Fund on this special 40th year anniversary. I wish the Puer-to Rican Bar Association continued success in many more years of service. RECOGNIZING THE SOUTH HALL ROTARY CLUB HON. DOUG COLLINS 
OF GEORGIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 12, 2018 Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the South Hall Rotary Club for raising over $8,000 for charities in Northeast Georgia. Rotary International is a service organization whose purpose is to bring together business and professional leaders to provide humani-tarian services, advance goodwill, and pro-mote peace around the world. During their recent Awesome 80s 5K run, the South Hall Rotary Club raised more than $8,000 to support the Relay for Life Hall County, the University of North Georgia Food Pantry, and their annual Foster Kids of Hall County Christmas Party. More than one hun-dred runners participated in the charitable event. Many of the participants celebrated by wearing costumes, neon shorts and leggings, wild colorful hairstyles, big glasses, and head-bands on race day. Uniformly, however, the participants reflected the generous spirit of Northeast Georgia, and a strong commitment to serving their community. In past races, the South Hall Rotary Club has helped raise funds to support new dental equipment for Good News Clinic, Boys & Girls Club, and for a new computer lab at the Com-pass Center. I visited with President Renee Carden and the South Hall Rotary Club this August and was inspired by their dedication and giving spirit. I thank the South Hall Rotary Club for their philanthropic efforts and their work to unite the community for good.

TEXAN: ARMY PRIVATE FIRST CLASS KRISTIAN MENCHACA— MEMBER OF THE BAND OF BROTHERS 
HON. TED POE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 12, 2018 Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the 101st Airborne of the United States Army is other-wise known as the Band of Brothers. They were called the Screaming Eagles of World War II. They held off the Germans in the battle of the Bulge. Their legacy was continued, as the 101st remained on duty in the blistering heat of Iraq during Operation Iraqi Freedom. Once again fighting the forces of tyranny and terrorism. Twenty-three year old Kristian Menchaca was born May 29, 1983, in my hometown of Houston, Texas. He moved to Brownsville with his mother, Maria Guadalupe Vasquez, when he was a young boy. He attended Gary Job Corps center in San Marcos, TX, where he completed the correctional officers training program in six months and earned a certifi-cate. Kristian Menchaca told his family Christ-mas Day, 2004 that he planned to enlist. They tried to talk him out of it, but Kristian Menchaca insisted, and his family came around. He had the goal of using his military experi-ence to become a Border Patrol agent. He scored so high on his entrance test that he was given the option to bypass the infantry. He chose not to do that. Instead, he signed up in March 2005 and wound up in the 101st Air-borne. He married his wife, Christina, three weeks before he was deployed with the United States Army. The Army turned Kristian Menchaca’s life around. It gave him a greater purpose, a higher calling. In June of 2006, at an outpost near Bagh-dad, American volunteers of the 101st found themselves surrounded and attacked by the enemy. One soldier, Specialist David Babineau, was killed in the skirmish. Private First Class Kristian Menchaca and Private First Class Thomas Tucker were kidnapped, captured, and later, murdered. He left behind a wife, a family, and a lot of grateful Americans. This enemy we fought in the desert sands of Iraq and Afghanistan were evil villains who oppose our righteous and just cause to pro-claim freedom throughout the world. These terrorists took no prisoners. They had no POW camps. News reports claimed the attackers of the outpost all wore masks to cover their faces. Mr. Speaker, outlaws and bandits of the Old West wore masks to disguise who they were because they, like these terrorists, covered up their wicked intentions of destruction of every-thing that is good and right. But just like those outlaws, these criminals were hunted, tracked, and brought to a speedy end, because the 101st brought justice to the hot hills of Iraq. Shakespeare said of the brothers in Henry V how they will be regarded. He said, ‘‘From this day to the ending of the world, but we in it shall be remembered; we few, we happy few, we band of brothers; for he today that sheds his blood with me shall be my brother.’’ Private First Class Kristian Menchaca was later awarded the Purple Heart, the Bronze Star and a Prisoner of War Medal. We continue to honor Private First Class Kristian Menchaca and the Band of Brothers— the unyielding warriors that proved strongest against terror. And that’s just the way it is. f 
IN REMEMBRANCE OF MR. ROBERT JENKINS 
HON. ROBERT J. WITTMAN 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 12, 2018 Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the service of Mr. Robert Jen-kins who passed away Monday, September 24, 2018. Robert Jenkins honored his country with a long career of service, first as a United States Marine, and then for over 30 years as an electronic technician for the federal govern-ment. His life was an example of commitment, love and service from which all of us would be wise to learn. Robert was born in Pawtucket, Rhode Is-land on May 10, 1930. One of six children, Robert enlisted with the Marine Corps when he was 17 years old in 1947, requiring his par-ents’ approval. He served with the 1st Marine Corps Division, 1st Weapon Battalion as 81mm Mortar Platoon Squad Leader. Sta-tioned at numerous locations from Guam to Quantico, Virginia, Robert served in the Ma-rine Corps for four years before being honor-ably discharged in 1951. In 1953, he married Miriam Freedman, who preceded him in death in February 2012, and they raised four daughters together: Karen, Carol, Beverly, and Andrea. He went on to have eight grandchildren and four great-grand-children. A loving and devoted husband, father and grandfather, Robert was a model for all of us not only in his work, but in his personal life. Mr. Speaker, I ask you to join me in hon-oring Mr. Jenkins and in thanking the Jenkins family their incredible sacrifices, devotion, and service to our nation; words cannot express our gratitude. On behalf of America’s First Dis-trict, we say thank you.

HONORING THE YMCA’S 135TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 12, 2018 Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, it is truly a feat to reach a 100th anniversary, it is a greater feat to reach a 125th anniversary, but, Mr. Speak-er, I want to recognize an organization within my district that has reached its 135th anniver-sary, the Yonkers Family YMCA. The Yonkers Family YMCA began in 1882 by accident. Story has it that the founders were traveling to New York City, but became lost in Yonkers. They decided to open a local chapter of the YMCA in Yonkers, and 135 years later, the Yonkers Family YMCA re-mains a cornerstone of the community. ‘‘To put Christian principles into practice through programs that build healthy spirit, mind and body for all.’’ That’s the YMCA’s mission statement, which strives to provide a safe environment where those in the commu-nity can better their lifestyle through health and fitness. As such, the Yonkers Family YMCA offers a variety of programs year-round for Yonkers residents and the surrounding area, that include boxing, aquatics, youth, and teen summer camps, as well as youth employ-ment training programs. It would not be possible for the Yonkers Family YMCA to offer the wellness programs and services to the community without help from the community itself. Yonkers has always stood by the YMCA, and continues to support its vital mission. I would be remiss to not mention the YMCA’s leadership, which ensures the contin-ued success of the YMCA on a day-to-day basis: Shawyn Patterson-Howard, Marisol Mancebo, Vincet Talia Ferro, John Thompson, Donald Golding, Mercedes Bangari, Donald Somerville, Carolyn Mosha, Franklin Peat, and Keith Guinyard. Additionally, I want to also thank the Board of Directors for their continual support of the YMCA: Maria George, Steven Tvert, Arnaldo Torres, John Pagliarola, Chris-topher Jonson, Jade Sharpe and Maurine Koranteng. Mr. Speaker, the Yonkers Family YMCA has been a central part of the lives of people all throughout the region for well over a century. It’s a remarkable feat that deserves this rec-ognition. Congratulations to the entire Yonkers Family YMCA family for 135 years of service, and may they have many more years of great success. f 
INSIDER THREATS TO AVIATION SECURITY: AIRLINE AND AIR-PORT PERSPECTIVES 
HON. RICK LARSEN 
OF WASHINGTON  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 12, 2018 Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Speaker, thank you, Chairman K
ATKO and Ranking Member W
ATSON COLEMAN , for calling this im-portant hearing to take a closer look at the new challenges that pose security threats to airports and carriers nationwide. As Ranking Member of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure’s Aviation Subcommittee, I am committed to ensuring the United States continues to have the safest air-space system in the history of flight. In light of recent events, it is clear there is more Con-gress can do to make the system safer. Less than two months ago, on August 10, 2018, an airline employee stole an aircraft at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (Sea-Tac) in my home state of Washington and engaged in unauthorized flight. If not for the rapid response teams, particu-larly Sea-Tac air traffic controllers and the Air National Guard, who remained calm through-out a very intense situation and worked dili-gently to contain the incident, this tragedy could have devastated communities in North-west Washington. Sea-Tac is a major hub in the national air-port network and has long been a leader in airport security. The airport conducts extensive security clearance measures and thorough employee background checks, and uses ad-vanced technologies to ensure the safety of its passengers and employees. However, this incident demonstrates the need for the federal government and industry

alike to consider new ways to ensure the safe-ty and security of passengers and employees. For years, I worked with my colleagues on the Transportation and Infrastructure Com-mittee to develop a long-term Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) reauthorization bill to ad-dress, among other things, safety issues present in our airspace system, and I am pleased Congress has recently enacted a comprehensive measure that will raise the bar on aviation safety for years to come. This legislation will help lessen the likeli-hood of incidents similar to the August 10 event at Sea-Tac in the future by requiring the FAA and the Transportation Security Adminis-tration (TSA) to work with industry to evaluate security gaps in our aviation system and pro-vide recommendations on industry improve-ments. Among its provisions, the legislation author-izes the FAA to carry out a pilot program to support non-federal acquisition and installation of surveillance systems for the non-movement areas of airports, such as airport cargo and maintenance areas. It also calls on the FAA to collaborate with stakeholders to advance a global standard for access to air carrier flight decks, and it directs the TSA to consult with the FAA to complete a detailed threat assessment to identify any safety or security risks associated with unau-thorized access to flight decks on commercial aircraft. While this long-term reauthorization makes considerable progress in aviation safety and security, our work is not done. In addition, in-dustry must work proactively to address these pressing issues. I commend Sea-Tac and aviation stakeholders for their collaboration fol-lowing the August 10 incident on a new series of industry best practices to advance airport security. I look forward to working with this Sub-committee, industry, and other stakeholders to address these new threats and to ensure the United States continues to maintain the safest aviation system in the world. With that, I thank the Chairman and Rank-ing Member for their bipartisan leadership on this important issue.

CELEBRATING THE CAREER OF MICHELLE MOYER 
HON. DAN NEWHOUSE 
OF WASHINGTON  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 12, 2018 Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Dr. Michelle Moyer, Associate Professor and Viticulture Extension Specialist at Washington State University, for her con-tributions to the robust Washington wine in-dustry. Dr. Moyer was awarded a grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Specialty Crop Research Initiative. This grant will assist Dr. Moyer in understanding and combating fungicide resistance, which currently threatens the $5 billion wine, table grape, and raisin crop. Dr. Moyer’s research will be essential in protecting vulnerable farmers and their crops, ensuring that Washington State continues to grow the best wine grapes and produce high quality wine. As I congratulate her efforts, I also recognize the important contributions of women to agriculture—and especially to the wine industry, in which women tend to be underrepresented. I urge my colleagues to join me in cele-brating Dr. Moyer’s successful career, and I wish her the best in her research. Go Cougs.

HONORING THE SERVICE OF DONALD E. SCHNOOR 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 12, 2018 Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the service of Donald E. Schnoor. Mr. Schnoor is a Korean War veteran who served the United States of America honorably. Donald E. Schnoor was born in Chowchilla on December 19, 1934. Twenty years later, he would be part of the famed First Cavalry Divi-sion fighting in Korea. Don attended local schools. In June 1952, shortly after graduating from Chowchilla High, he enlisted for three years in the U.S. Army. After basic training at Fort Ord, he was se-lected to train as a musician with the Army Band Training Unit. Upon completion of band training, he was assigned to play the trom-bone with the 6th Army band at Fort Mason in San Francisco. The band played for troops leaving and arriving by ship to and from the Far East, primarily Korea. Numerous Holly-wood and local professional celebrities per-formed with the band. Wanting to see a bit of the world, Don subsequently volunteered for duty with Army occupation troops in Japan. Upon arrival in Japan, Don was informed that although he had been trained as a musi-cian the Army considered him an infantryman first and a trombone player second. Upon reaching Inchon, Korea, Don joined the 5th Regiment of the legendary First Cavalry Divi-sion along the frontlines southeast of Seoul near Yong Dong Po. He was assigned duty as part of a fire team for a 75 MM recoilless rifle mounted on a 3⁄4ton 4x4 utility truck. Don served in Korea until the truce was signed in 1954 and then joined the rest of the First Cavalry Division in Hokkaido, Japan. Later that year, the 5th Regiment moved south to Sendai, Japan, where Don joined the First Cavalry Band and Orchestra. Shortly after joining the band, Don was recommended to audition for the U.S.O. Orchestra, and after tough competition, was accepted. He spent the remainder of his overseas service traveling in Japan playing for U.S.O. shows for Amer-ican servicemen. Don was one of three trom-bonists and enjoyed the duty. Don returned to the U.S. in the late spring of 1955 and was discharged as a sergeant at Fort Ord. For his service, he was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation, the Korean Service Medal, the United Nations Medal, the National Defense Service Medal, and the Good Con-duct Medal. After military service to his country, Don re-turned to Chowchilla and began a career in farming that has continued for fifty-six years. He and his wife, Peggy, have three daughters, six grandchildren, and two great-grand-children. Don is a Life Member of Chowchilla VFW Post 9896, the American Legion Post of Madera, the Madera Elks, and the First United Methodist Church of Madera. Don said, ‘‘I am truly proud to have had the opportunity to serve my country.’’ Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to the service of Donald E. Schnoor for his dedication to his family and his country.

RECOGNIZING RED ARNDT FOR HIS LIFETIME OF SERVICE AND COMMITMENT 
HON. STEVE KING 
OF IOWA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 12, 2018 Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize Red Arndt for his many years of service to the Lewis & Clark Regional Water System, as well as his lifetime commitment to bringing safe and reliable water to the rural comers of this country. Bom Lennis Arndt on May 1, 1948, he earned the nickname, Red, while in grade school from his full head of red hair. The name stuck and most people only know him today as Red Arndt. Red grew up in Springfield, Minnesota, about 90 minutes from his current hometown, Luverne where he first started working in 1989 as their public utilities director. Shortly after beginning his new position, Red heard about a proposal to bring water from the Missouri River in South Dakota to the surrounding states. A major undertaking with more people doubting the idea than supporting, Red saw the opportunity and potential, recommending to the mayor and city council that Luverne join and become one of the first members of the corporation that would later become the Lewis & Clark Regional Water System. Seeing Lewis & Clark develop from concep-tion to construction was a labor of love for Red, and a mission he fought hard to achieve.

Red, one of only two original directors from 1990 still on the board, held a shovel when the ground was first broke in 2003. He has probably made over 60 trips to Washington, DC and many more to the state capitals and attended countless county, city and community meetings. Fighting to get Lewis & Clark off the ground was just a starting point for Red. He has worked tirelessly on behalf of the project, serv-ing as the vice-chairman of the board begin-ning in 1994 until becoming the board chair-man in 2006, a position he still holds. Lewis & Clark has experienced ups and downs during those year, yet under Red’s leadership over 200 miles of pipeline have been laid in the ground currently delivering much needed water to 14 member communities and rural water projects, reaching over 300,000 people across South Dakota, Minnesota and Iowa. He has seen over $470M in funding to Lewis & Clark, including $57M in advance funding from the three states. Red’s indisputable dedication was dem-onstrated when he participated in the ribbon cutting ceremony for the water treatment plant in August 2012, a mere two weeks after hav-ing open heart surgery. His fellow directors surprised him at the ceremony by presenting him with the Lewis & Clark Trailblazer Award, which is the organization’s highest honor. In May 2016, Luverne was finally able to celebrate their connection to Lewis & Clark, with Red reveling in taking the first swig of water. It was at this ceremony that the meter building in Luverne was dedicated in Red’s honor. Red will be the first to acknowledge that this endeavor, benefiting generations to come in the tristate area, has been a true team effort. But, there is no question Red’s vi-sion for the future, dogged dedication and strong leadership have been a driving force through the years. When he is not dedicating his time to Lewis & Clark, Red is a proud father of three boys (all sharing his red hair) and grandfather of three red-headed little girls. His family is his pride-and-joy. You will often find Red wearing a pin honoring his son who served in the United States Air Force. As a dessert first type of guy, Red lives life to the fullest, enjoying travel, fishing and nu-merous other outdoor activities in his free time, as well as hanging out in his ‘‘man cave’’. I am grateful for his commitment to public service, his hard work on behalf of Lewis & Clark, and, more importantly, I am proud to call him a friend. Mr. Speaker, I commend Red Arndt for his many great contributions and wish him the best as he continues to make the most out of the life God has given.

RAISING AWARENESS OF CHILDHOOD CANCER 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 12, 2018 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize and bring awareness to childhood cancer and the devastating effects it has on these young lives and their families. Cancer is a tough disease regardless of whom it affects. Recently, Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), a rare, highly malignant form of cancer, took the life of Mr. Kye Graceson Davis, a young resi-dent of my Congressional district, at the ten-der age of six. On behalf of the 18th Congressional District of Texas, I extend my deepest sympathies to Kye’s loving parents, Christopher and Kaysha Davis; his surviving siblings, Christopher Jr., Jade, Madison, and Kadence Davis; and all of Kye’s loving family and friends. As a founder of the Congressional Chil-dren’s Caucus, member of the Childhood Can-cer Caucus, loving mother, and grandmother, children are near and dear to my heart. I cannot fathom the sorrow that the Davis family is experiencing, but I am grateful that to honor his memory, the City of Houston de-clared, October 21st, as ‘‘Kye Graceson Davis Day.’’ Kye was an adventurous child who loved the outdoors, sports and learning, most nota-bly spending time at the barn riding horses, or playing baseball with his Little League team. His favorite time of year in Houston was during the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo, and he always had hopes of partici-pating in the rodeo when he was old enough. Unfortunately, Kye’s dreams were placed on hold when he was diagnosed with cancer in November of 2016. On January 11, 2018, after waging a valiant fight, Kye lost his fight with RMS. RMS is a type of sarcoma made up of cells that normally develop into skeletal (voluntary) muscles. RMS is also the most common type of soft tissue sarcoma in children. About two-thirds of RMS cases are diag-nosed in children younger than age 10. There are three main types of RMS: Embryonal RMS occurs most often in the head and neck area or in the genital or urinary organs, but can occur anywhere in the body and is the most common type of this disease, Alveolar RMS occurs most often in the arms or legs, chest, abdomen, genital organs, or anal area, and Anaplastic RMS which is the least common type of rhabdomyosarcoma in children. RMS is more common in children, although it does sometimes occur in adults. According to the American Cancer Society: ‘‘About 3 percent of all childhood cancers are RMS and there are an estimated 400 to 500 new cases of RMS reported each year in the United States with more than half of them in children younger than 10 years old.’’ Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) can start nearly anywhere in the body, so the symptoms of RMS can be different in each person. Signs and symptoms of rhabdomyosarcoma depend on where the cancer is located. For example, if the cancer is in the head or neck area, signs and symptoms may include, among others, headache, bulging or swelling of the eyes, bleeding in the nose, throat or ears. If the cancer is in the urinary or reproductive system, signs and symptoms may include, among others, trouble urinating and blood in the urine, difficulty with bowel movements, a mass or bleeding in the vagina or rectum. If the cancer is in the arms or legs, signs and symptoms may include, among others, swelling or a lump in the arm or leg, pain in the affected area, though sometimes there is no pain. In 2017, it was estimated that among chil-dren ages 0 to 14 years, 10,270 will be diag-nosed with cancer and 1,190 will die of the disease in 2017. RMS’s 5-year survival rate for children is generally around 20 percent to 40 percent be-cause the kids in this group often have the metastatic form of this disease at the time they are diagnosed. Metastatic cancers are cancers that have spread to multiple parts of the body. RMS is almost always treated with both local therapy (surgery and/or radiation ther-apy) as well as chemotherapy. However, the details of treatment can vary based on a number of factors, including the lo-cation and extent of the tumor and which risk group the patient falls into. All children and adults with RMS will be treated with surgery to remove the tumor if it can be done without causing major damage or disfigurement. If this is not possible, chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy may be used first to try to shrink the tumor; if it shrinks enough, surgery can be done at this point. The goal of surgery is to remove the tumor completely, but this is not always possible. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) has a number of programs that address childhood cancers specifically, and many of the insti-tute’s other research programs are applicable to children with cancer even if they are not fo-cused specifically on pediatric cancers. Because children’s bodies are very sensitive to radiation, doctors are looking for ways to limit the doses as much as possible. Even if the tumor appears to have been re-moved completely, all patients with RMS need chemotherapy. Without it, it is very likely that the cancer will come back in distant parts in the body be-cause small amounts of cancer have almost always reached other parts of the body when the cancer is first found (even though they can’t be seen on imaging tests). If cancer is left behind after surgery or if the cancer has some less favorable traits and it has not spread to distant sites (as is the case most of the time), radiation therapy will also be given. For example, in stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), a special machine aims very thin beams of radiation at the tumor from many different angles, concentrating it on the tumor very precisely for short periods. Newer radiation therapy techniques allow doctors to aim the radiation more precisely, limiting the amount that reaches normal body tissues. The overall outlook for children with cancer has improved greatly over the last half-cen-tury. In 1975, just over 50 percent of children di-agnosed with cancer before age 20 years sur-vived at least 5 years. In 2007–2013, 83 percent of children diag-nosed with cancer before age 20 years sur-vived at least 5 years. As of January 1, 2014, approximately 419,000 survivors of childhood and adolescent cancer (diagnosed at ages 0 to 19 years) were alive in the United States. For soft tissue sarcomas, 5-year survival rates in 2007 to 2013 among children and adolescents ages 0 to 19 years ranged from 65 percent (rhabdomyosarcoma) to 95 percent (chondrosarcoma), but children with sarcomas

who present with metastatic disease have much lower 5-year survival rates. We must continue to support institutions that treat and care for the littlest patients because they are our nation’s next generation of engi-neers, lawyers, doctors, painters, writers, and leaders. We must continue to be vigilant in protecting the future of this country, which belongs to the youth. Although his life was short, Kye Graceson Davis will live in our memories forever. I urge my colleagues to continue supporting research measures that will protect the chil-dren of America and lead us to the elimination of childhood cancer.

Wilheit Packaging then transports these cages to the Hall County Recycling Center, where the recyclables are unloaded, sorted by category, weighed, processed, and baled. Southern Waste and Recycling built the alliance among these companies and monitors and evaluates their sustainability practices so that they can make the most of their resources and produce the least amount of waste. To date, 1,500 tons of fiber and 160 tons of plastics have been kept out of the landfill, helping keep Hall County clean and beautiful. Because of this, last month the Georgia Re-cycling Coalition Conference awarded Hall County Resource Recovery and its partners for their innovative methods. Never before in the history of the Georgia Recycling Coalition Conference has a partnership project like this won the Innovation Award. I celebrate Hall County Resource Recovery, Kubota, Southern Waste and Recycling, and Wilheit Packaging for the example of innova-tion, community building, and environmental stewardship they’ve set in Northeast Georgia. f 
HONORING THE SERVICE OF TONY MACHADO 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 12, 2018 Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the service of Tony Machado. Mr. Machado is a Korean War veteran who served the United States of America honorably. Tony Machado was born in Turlock, Cali-fornia in 1933. After graduating from Hilmar High, he worked in agriculture for a few years until he was drafted into the United States Armed Forces. After completing basic training at Fort Ord, Tony was trained as a military policeman at the Basic Military Training School. There he received training in tactical and garrison law enforcement duties, including reports, forms, basic law enforcement tasks, security, un-armed self-defense, responding to incidents, and support activities such as convoys, check-points and enemy prisoner of war operations. Once deployed to Korea, he was assigned to the legendary 15th Infantry Regiment. Arriv-ing during the final months of the war, Tony was a member of Company A of the 15th Regiment. Despite the 1953 armistice, ten-sions ran high as the North Koreans con-stantly moved forces closer to the DMZ. Tony’s MP unit provided invaluable security for convoys, directing traffic at key road junctions as well as many other duties. Tony served seventeen months in Korea, later returning to the U.S. to assume duties at Fort Ord until his discharge as a Private First Class. For his service, he was awarded the Korea Service Medal, the United Nations Medal, the National Defense Medal, and the Good Conduct Medal. After his service, Tony returned to agri-culture, working as a dairyman, eventually op-erating his own dairy on Chowchilla’s Road 14. He is a life member of the Chowchilla VFW Post 9896, a member of the Farm Bu-reau, the Cabrillo Club, Lions Club, and served as a director of the Madera District Fair. He was inducted into the Chowchilla Ath-letic Foundation Hall of Fame and was chosen as 2007’s Chowchilla Unique Citizen of the Year by the Chamber of Commerce. Tony continues to make his home in Chowchilla. He has six children and five grandchildren. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to the service of Tony Machado for his dedication to his family and his country. RECOGNIZING MYRA PINTO HON. THEODORE E. DEUTCH 
OF FLORIDA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 12, 2018 Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in recognition of Myra Pinto for being named Woman of the Year for Wynmoor Hadassah, a chapter in Hadassah’s Florida Broward region. Hadassah, the Women’s Zionist Organiza-tion of America, has maintained a steadfast commitment to Jewish values, women’s health, and Israel since its establishment over a century ago. Serving a global community, Hadassah’s volunteer work in the U.S. and in Israel sustains education and advocacy efforts for women’s health and safety, for civil and human rights, and for women’s economic eq-uity. It fuels policy work in support of Israel and the American Jewish community, and it provides support for the Hadassah Medical Organization, a Nobel Peace Prize-nominated organization that treats one million patients a year and performs leading, world-renowned medical research and clinical trials. Ms. Pinto’s honor from this remarkable or-ganization is well deserved. At 92 years old, Ms. Pinto continues to make indelible contribu-tions to her Jewish community and Hadassah where she has served as her chapter treas-urer for 5 years and counting. Her volunteer work at Wynmoor Hadassah follows a 25-year career in service of our nation’s education sys-tem, during which time Ms. Pinto worked as a school secretary in a Brooklyn junior high school. In addition to her tireless work and many achievements as a professional and as a volunteer, Ms. Pinto is also a mother to a son and a daughter. Mr. Speaker, today I ask this body to recog-nize Ms. Pinto for her work at the Wynmoor Hadassah Chapter and for her resolute dedi-cation to her community.

MR. BARRY COHEN 
HON. KATHY CASTOR 
OF FLORIDA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 12, 2018 Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life of a true champion for justice, Barry Cohen. His remarkable work fighting passionately for all the people of the Tampa Bay community is worthy of recogni-tion. Mr. Cohen graduated from Tampa’s own Plant High School, earned his bachelor’s from Florida State University, served in the U.S. Coast Guard and earned his law degree from one of America’s oldest and distinguished in-stitutions, the Walter F. George School of Law at Mercer University. Mr. Cohen served his entire legal career on behalf of communities and individuals he felt were not treated fairly. His desire to help bal-ance the scales and serve those that some would describe as in the lowliest stations stemmed from a childhood experience where he witnessed his father being mistreated by a cook at work. He successfully waged count-less civil and criminal battles on behalf of those he felt needed help confronting the pow-erful. He never hesitated to go up against any-one if he believed a larger principle was at

stake. He fought passionately for what he be-lieved in, regularly taking a large number of cases pro bono, and sometimes putting his own money into cases he was defending, sim-ply because he believed that an injustice had been done. Mr. Cohen was one of the pio-neers in fighting his clients’ cases outside the courtroom, especially when odds seemed stacked against them. For example, when Ste-ven and Marlene Aisenberg were the only sus-pects in the disappearance of their 5-month- old baby, Mr. Cohen’s defense included an appearance on Larry King Live. Charges were later dropped, and Mr. Cohen won the couple $3 million in legal fees. Mr. Cohen dedicated his expertise and re-sources to make a difference in the lives of so many in our community and by doing so en-lightened our community and challenged us all to do better. It is no wonder so many put themselves in his hands to defend their life, liberty or protect the financial future of their family. He was a man who would work tire-lessly—weekends, nights and holidays—what-ever it took, to provide a voice to the voice-less. He believed that no one, regardless of position or wealth, was more entitled to justice than anyone else. His selfless service earned him a special place in our community and he will be greatly missed. Mr. Cohen is survived by his wife, Barbara, and their son, Barry Alexander Cohen, children, Geena Zaslavsky, Steven Cohen, Kevin Cohen; and his sister, Cynthia Cohen Wright, his brothers by mar-riage, Stanley Wright and Les Barnett. He was recently predeceased by his sister, Hope Barnett. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the Tampa Bay community, we thank Barry Cohen for his life-long respect and dignity leveling the playing field. He will always be remembered as a true champion for justice and the working people of Tampa Bay.

WILL KELLER, MOLINA HEALTHCARE COMMUNITY CHAMPION 
HON. DAN NEWHOUSE 
OF WASHINGTON  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 12, 2018 Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Will Keller of Omak for receiving Molina Healthcare’s Community Champion Award. Every year, Molina Healthcare recognizes community members who go above and be-yond in their service and volunteerism. Will Keller is an exemplary Community Champion. His friends and neighbors will tell you that he is always willing to lend a helping hand. He was instrumental in building and opening a homeless shelter in Okanogan County that will be able to provide year-round services to those who need them. Will recently lost his wife, which is abso-lutely devastating for anyone to experience. However, he used her passing as inspiration to give back even more to his community. He hosted a yard sale to raise funds for the homeless shelter, and he built a prayer room for local church meetings. His coworker, Cathy, states it best: Will doesn’t go out to volunteer; he is the essence of volunteerism. He is extremely deserving of Molina’s Community Champion Award. I urge my colleagues to join me in thanking him for his service to Central Washington. f 
HONORING WILLIAM HUMMER 
HON. SAM GRAVES 
OF MISSOURI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 12, 2018 Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I proudly pause to recognize William Hummer. William is a very special young man who has exemplified the finest qualities of citizenship and leadership by taking an active part in the Boy Scouts of America, Troop 60, and earning the most prestigious award of Eagle Scout. Will has been very active with his troop, par-ticipating in many scout activities. Over the many years Will has been involved with scout-ing, he has not only earned numerous merit badges, but also the respect of his family, peers, and community. Most notably, Will has contributed to his community through his Eagle Scout project. Will developed a plan for placement of eight fitness stations along a community walking trail in Duncan Park in Sa-vannah, Missouri. He organized fundraising along with the donations of several local busi-nesses and raised the funds necessary for the installation of the all access fitness stations. Mr. Speaker, I proudly ask you to join me in commending William Hummer for his accom-plishments with the Boy Scouts of America and for his efforts put forth in achieving the highest distinction of Eagle Scout.

SALUTING BROOKLYN CHINESE- AMERICAN ASSOCIATION’S EIGHTH AVENUE SENIOR CEN-TER 
HON. NYDIA M. VELA´ZQUEZ 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 12, 2018 Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to salute Brooklyn Chinese-American Associa-tion’s Eighth Avenue Senior Center on the milestone of twenty-five years of service to Brooklyn’s senior community. For seniors living in the Sunset Park, Bor-ough Park and Bay Ridge communities of Brooklyn, the Center provides life-changing services such as daily meals, medical check-ups and screenings as well as educational workshops. On an average day, the Center of-fers services to over 250 seniors and has memberships of over 5,000 seniors. As a part of this cherished celebration, the Center will host their Annual Millennial Roundtables, which places 12 seniors, aged 84 or older, at each table, making up a com-bined age of over 1,000 years. I would like to express my profound appre-ciation to all the staff and community at BCA’s Eighth Avenue Senior Center. We are all proud of the work this community hub has ac-complished over the last twenty-five years. My best wishes for a successful event. RECOGNIZING TRISTAN RE SHAR BREAUX HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 12, 2018 Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I ask the House to join me in recognizing Tristan Re Shar Breaux, who has served as my District Director for the last four years. During this time, Tristan has proven himself to be a com-mitted and valuable member of my staff. He was dedicated to the work that our office pro-vides to our more than 700,000 residents. On September 30th, Tristan departed my office to serve as the new Director of Policy for the Na-tional Housing Conference. Tristan’s passion for economic development, affordable housing, and fair investment in our low-income commu-nities will be an asset to the organization and the country. His work ethic, humor, intelligence and compassion will surely be missed by his colleagues, the residents of the District of Co-lumbia and especially my office. Tristan, a native of Queens, New York, adopted D.C. upon his arrival. After serving the House Budget Committee; the United States Senate; various local, state and federal elected officials in Virginia, Tristan first joined my office as my Events Coordinator and led the development of my Black Men & Boys Commission & Caucus. His persistence to get the job done and his gracious demeanor made Tristan a pleasure to be around and work with. Tristan’s presence in my office and in the city will surely be missed and I wish him all the best in his future endeavors. I ask my colleagues to join me in recog-nizing Tristan R. Breaux for his outstanding service to the House of Representatives, my office and to the District of Columbia.

AMERICAN SOLDER, SPECIALIST DONALD E. VALENTINE III 
HON. TED POE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 12, 2018 Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, ‘‘The sol-dier is the Army,’’ and ‘‘wars may be fought with weapons, but they are won by men.’’ While we mourn those men who die, ‘‘We should thank God such men ever lived.’’ These are the words of General George Pat-ton in World War II. One of those soldiers was Specialist Donald E. Valentine III of the United States Army. He was born in Houston, Texas, on March 5, 1986. Donald Valentine joined the United States Army because of the 9/11 attack on this country. His mother Anna said, ‘‘My husband and I were behind Donald 100 percent. I was so proud of him no matter what he ever did. He made me very proud to be his mother.’’ Those are the words from another of America’s Gold Star Mothers. I met Anna Valentine and many members of the Valentine family at the Veterans National Cemetery in Houston, where mothers like Anna, who had children killed in Iraq and Af-ghanistan, were being honored. We call those noble women Gold Star Mothers. Anna Valen-tine’s son is buried on that hallowed ground of the fallen in Houston, Texas.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD —Extensions of RemarksE1403 October 12, 2018 
Specialist Valentine was assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 23rd Infantry Regiment, 4th Bri-gade, 2nd Infantry Division of the Stryker Bri-gade Combat Team from Fort Lewis, Wash-ington. Specialist Valentine was killed along with two other soldiers on September 18, 2007, in Muqdadiyah, Iraq, when an lED, an improvised explosive device, detonated near him. Mr. Speaker, you understand the use of an lED by America’s enemy is a coward’s way of fighting the war. These enemies rant and rave and preach hate in the name of religion, but they cover their faces with masks and hide in caves and dark, dusty ditches. They are afraid to come out in the open and face the Amer-ican soldier. So our enemy detonates remote- controlled bombs. Specialist Donald Valentine III’s military roots run deep. His father, Donald II, is a Navy veteran. His brother Daniel, who was 19 at the time, wanted to enlist to be with his brother Donald in Iraq. America owes much to families like the Valentines. Being from a military fam-ily, he moved around a lot as a child. He lived in Florida most of his life and also in Idaho, but wanted to be buried in ‘‘Big H,’’ as he called Houston, Texas, because of many rea-sons. One of those reasons was because he spent so much time growing up with his grandparents who live in Houston. Donald was married for one year to Lucia, who said ‘‘Donald had all the qualities any girl would want.’’ She had talked to Donald on their first anniversary, 3 days before his death in Iraq. Specialist Valentine told his family that, ‘‘if he did not survive the war, they should stay strong.’’ He was the 91st fallen service mem-ber with ties to the Houston area to have been killed in Iraq or Afghanistan. A statement has been credited to one of Rome’s centurions when he told his troops, ‘‘How you yet live will echo throughout eter-nity.’’ Specialist Valentine lived a short but faithful life to the things that were important to him: family and country. He was 21 when he was killed. Mr. Speaker, General George Patton was right about such warriors. We should thank God that such men as Specialist Donald Val-entine III ever lived. And that’s just the way it is.

HONORING THE SALINAS CITY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL DISTRICT 
HON. JIMMY PANETTA 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 12, 2018 Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Salinas City Elementary School District on their 150th anniversary. SCESD has demonstrated great dedication to our community and invaluable service to children and families of the central coast of California. Founded in 1868, the SCESD began with nine students and quickly expanded to accom-modate the growing Salinas Valley. The dis-trict has provided a well-rounded education and a safe learning environment for genera-tions of Central Coast families. Today, it pro-vides free, high quality education to nearly nine thousand students at fourteen public schools. The district’s belief in public education as the foundation of democracy shapes their am-bition to serve children of all backgrounds re-gardless of race, economic status, religion or ability. Further, it strives to engage parents and families to create a strong collaborative community to support the educational experi-ences of their children. As a district, the SCESD has also made great strides in engaging students with twenty- first century technology. Students in grades third through sixth are assigned their own laptop to complete homework and class as-signments, while kindergarten through second grade students use shared iPads to com-plement their learning experiences. Teachers are also empowered to use digital programs to accompany in-class instruction that has re-sulted in immense progress for their students. Through steadfast effort and wise use of re-sources, the SCESD has facilitated upgrades to numerous school facilities. Seven school sites have recently expanded outdoor play-grounds, sustainability features, equipment and security systems to enhance the edu-cational experiences of students. The SCESD has assuredly continued its tradition of pur-suing projects that increase opportunity for the children of the Salinas Valley. As the Salinas City Elementary School Dis-trict celebrates its 150 years as a fundamental component of our community, I am proud to commend them on their continued service to the young scholars of the Central Coast. The schools and teachers within this district have undoubtedly created substantial impacts on the lives of our future leaders. Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in congratu-lating the Salinas City Elementary School Dis-trict on 150 years of excellence. f

HONORING THE SERVICE OF MELVIN ‘‘CORKY’’ GILLIAM HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 12, 2018 Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the service of Melvin Gilliam. Mr. Gilliam is a Korean War veteran who served the United States of America honorably. In 1952, Melvin ‘‘Corky’’ Gilliam said good-bye to his classmates at Chowchilla High and traveled to Fort Ord for induction into the U.S. Army. Gilliam was designated as a rifleman, and within a short time, he landed at Pusan, Korea. The young private was assigned to the 40th Infantry Division, participating in the Ko-rean War’s major battles at Heartbreak Ridge, the Punchbowl, and Sand Bag Castle. In the following months, the 40th was sent into action along the Main Line of Resistance (MLR) above the 38th Parallel at a place called Sand Bag Castle. The division engaged in heavy fighting, and Private Melvin Gilliam was wounded by shell fragments. While recov-ering at an aid station, it was discovered that he was only seventeen years old. He was sent to Japan to Camp Drake where he remained until his eighteenth birthday on 4 December 1952. After his return to Korea, Gilliam served as rifleman, carrying the Browning Automatic Rifle and worked as a radio operator with line units. In July 1953 Gilliam boarded the merchant ship General Miggs for return to the U.S. For the remainder of his three-year enlistment, Gilliam served with the 2nd Division at Fort Lewis, Washington. While at Fort Lewis, his regiment was selected to star in the film ‘‘To Hell and Back,’’ the true story of Audie Mur-phy, the most decorated soldier of World War II. Gilliam was able to meet the soldier-actor, and was honored to be part of the film, acting as a German rifleman. Before leaving active duty, Gilliam would also serve with the 7th Ar-mored and the 44th Infantry Divisions. Melvin Gilliam was discharged as a corporal and served five more years in the Army Re-serve. For his service he was awarded the Purple Heart, the National Defense Service Medal, the Good Conduct Medal, the Korean Service Medal with 3 bronze stars, United Na-tions Service Medal, ROK Presidential Unit Ci-tation, and the Combat Infantryman’s Badge. To this day he is very proud to have served his country. After release from active duty he returned to Chowchilla and worked as a dairyman and in trucking until his retirement. He and his late wife Loretta made their home in Chowchilla. He has four children, six grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. He has been active in the community for more than a half-century as a member of the First Baptist Church, Life Member of Chowchilla VFW Post 9896, Life Member of American Legion Post 148, a member of the Military Order of the Cooties of the U.S., Lions Club International, Free and Accepted Masons of Chowchilla, Scottish Rite of Freemasonry— 32nd Degree, Tehran Shriners, the Noble No-bles Club of Tehran Temple, and E Clampus Vitus.

Chief Bales became Golden Fire Chief in 2001, but his personal passion and a commitment to his community started long before then. For more than 50 years, Chief Bales contributed to several Colorado communities and other communities across the country with positions at the Rocky Flats Fire Department, Genesee Fire Protection Dis-trict, Cunningham Fire Protection District, City of Thornton Fire Department, and the Wichita Fire Department.

OF WASHINGTON  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 12, 2018 Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor Staff Sergeant Jack Pendleton of Yakima, who was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his service during World War II. In Germany in 1944, Sergeant Pendleton lost his life while drawing enemy gunfire away from his squad, and he was awarded the Medal of Honor one year later. He is the sole Medal of Honor recipient from Yakima. I would like to thank U.S. Army Command Sergeant Major Ramon Dang. Two years ago, Sergeant Major Dang was touring our state to care for the graves of Medal of Honor recipi-ents when he discovered that Sergeant Pen-dleton’s grave did not include an appropriate memorial. A memorial statue, a 6-foot granite sculpture, was subsequently dedicated at Tahoma Cemetery on September 26th of this year. Sergeant Pendleton’s Medal of Honor cita-tion reads, ‘‘[His] sacrifice enabled the entire company to continue the advance and com-plete their mission at a critical phase of the action.’’ He made the ultimate sacrifice for his brothers-in-arms and our nation, and I urge my colleagues to join me in honoring the memory of Staff Sergeant Jack Pendleton. INTERNATIONAL DAY OF THE GIRL HON. ROBIN L. KELLY 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 12, 2018 Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, today we recognize October 11th as the Inter-national Day of the Girl, a day to promote girls’ empowerment and examine the chal-lenges and barriers girls face around the world. According to the UN High Commission on Refugees, there are approximately 65 mil-lion forcibly displaced people worldwide and half are under the age of 18. Prolonged peri-ods away from home result in low school en-rollment rates for displaced children, which leaves girls vulnerable to early marriage, human trafficking, and child labor. The Pro-tecting Girl’s Access to Education in Vulner-able Settings Act, which myself and Congress-man C
HABOT introduced, aims to ensure edu-cational needs of displaced girls are consid-ered in the design, implementation, and eval-uation of U.S. foreign assistance. Girls per-form better in school when they have access to quality education and a safe space to learn. International Day of the Girl, is a day to reflect on the importance of ensuring all children, es-pecially girls, have access to safe, quality edu-cation.

OCTOBER IS NATIONAL BREAST CANCER AWARENESS MONTH 
HON. TED POE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 12, 2018 Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, October is National Breast Cancer Awareness Month. This month is devoted to raising awareness and educating folks about breast cancer and honoring the thousands of women across our nation who have been diagnosed, fighting, or have survived breast cancer. Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women in the United States. It is the second deadliest cancer among American women. 1 in 8 women will develop breast can-cer over the course of her lifetime, and it is estimated that this year more than 252,000 cases of invasive breast cancer is expected to be reported. In Texas, 17,566 women were di-agnosed with breast cancer in 2018. In the Second District of Texas, I am proud of our local hospitals, school districts, and non-profits who promote breast cancer aware-ness and prevention during this month. Many are showing their support by replacing their outdoor light bulb with a pink bulb. I have no-ticed many front porch lights shining pink around our town. These pink bulbs help sup-port a local nonprofit called Project Mammo-gram. Project Mammogram offers mammo-grams and other services free to patients in the Lake Houston area. Remember, not every woman can afford a mammogram. By pro-viding free mammograms this organization has saved thousands of women. Almost everyone we know has been touched by this disease. Unfortunately, this disease has hit close to home for one of our very own community leaders, Leslie Raffa. Leslie and her husband, Tony, own two res-taurants in the Lake Houston area. They are well-loved and respected in the community. Leslie battled breast cancer for over two and a half years, her final treatment was in Feb-ruary 2017. During the course of her treat-ments, she underwent a bilateral mastectomy, breast reconstruction and chemotherapy. Dur-ing her battle, Leslie lost her sister to breast cancer in the summer of 2016. Leslie contin-ued to fight while mourning the death of her sister. Leslie rang the monumental bell at MD An-derson in April of 2016. The bell signifies the end to treatment. Ringing the bell is a celebra-tion. But Leslie soon realized that the end of treatment is not necessarily the end. She thought if she would just get to the end and cross the finish line it would all be over. But she soon discovered an emotional fall out oc-curs. Cancer is hard mentally. It takes months, years, to recover. She shares this piece of ad-vice for those going through what she went through, ‘‘it’s ok to have a pity party, but don’t unpack and stay there.’’ Leslie exudes positive energy and happiness, even during the lowest moments. She beat the odds that come along with this disease and tries her best to educate those around her to get annual breast exams. Now this is where I usually say: ‘‘And that’s just the way it is.’’ But Leslie’s story is not over. The same year she completed her last treatment, Hurricane Harvey devastated our area. Raffa’s Waterfront Grill was destroyed. Friends and family gathered quickly around them to help rebuild the restaurant that took on 5 feet of water. Leslie didn’t flounder in pity and give up; she put on her water boots and gloves (I am sure they are pink) and began the cleanup process. Raffa’s will open this year, and our community cannot be any happier for Tony and Leslie. This month Leslie will speak in front of hundreds of folks at the annual In the Pink Luncheon to share her sur-vival story. Stories like Leslie’s are an inspira-tion and a reminder that we must keep up the fight until there is a cure.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today alongside my friend Mr. Norcross to honor Carr & Duff, Inc., a fam-ily-owned electrical construction company in my district that will be celebrating its 60th an-niversary this month. Mr. Norcross worked as a journeyman, foreman, and lead splicer for Carr & Duff, one of his first jobs as an elec-trician. In fact, he was hired by the company’s founders we honor today. In 1958, Edward Duff and Harold (Hap) Carr were just two lineman who set out to fulfill the electrical construction needs of Philadelphia’s burgeoning suburbs. More than half a century later, what started as a single line truck oper-ation has evolved into one of the most promi-nent electrical contractors in the Greater Phila-delphia and Tri-State Area, now employing roughly 200 people. Though much has changed for Carr & Duff over the past sixty years, much has stayed the same. It’s still a family-owned business, now in its second generation, and it’s common to see parent and child working alongside one another. The Carr & Duff team is just as com-mitted to giving back to the community as they were some six decades ago, having donated tens of thousands of hours and equipment. They continue to be a vital arm of natural dis-aster response along the Eastern seaboard, true pillars of the communities they serve. People have always looked to them personally and professionally during times of need. When power is knocked out, Carr and Duff are im-mediately on the scene. In fact, they carry such a wide array of transformers that even the utility companies turn to them during crunch time. As leaders of the Blue Collar Caucus, we know that men and women like those em-ployed by Carr & Duff are the backbone of American communities. We celebrate their achievements; their hard work and constant contributions to our districts. We rise today to thank Carr & Duff, Inc. for upholding its com-mitment to reliable and accessible service while keeping its employees safe—and for all it contributes to Huntingdon Valley, Greater Philadelphia, and New Jersey. We need more companies like Carr & Duff.

IN RECOGNITION OF BRECKSVILLE-BROADVIEW HEIGHTS MIDDLE SCHOOL AS A 2018 NATIONAL BLUE RIBBON SCHOOL 
HON. DAVID P. JOYCE 
OF OHIO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 12, 2018 Mr. JOYCE of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I would like to acknowledge Brecksville-Broadview Heights Middle School for being recognized as a National Blue Ribbon School for 2018. Since 1982, the National Blue Ribbon Schools Pro-gram has recognized public and private schools for academic excellence. Brecksville- Broadview Heights Middle School is an excep-tional center for learning and preparing stu-dents for all stages of life. I’d like to congratu-late the teachers and staff of Brecksville- Broadview Heights for creating an environ-ment where students can excel. As a father of three children, I believe there is no greater cause than educating the minds of the future. Most of all, I’d like to congratulate the hard-working students for a job well done. I am proud to have such an example of academic excellence in Northeast Ohio and I congratu-late Brecksville-Broadview Heights Middle School on this well-deserved recognition. f 
2018 ANGELS IN ADOPTION 
HON. DAN NEWHOUSE 
OF WASHINGTON  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 12, 2018 Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize two extraordinary individuals from my district—James and Angie Sessions—who opened their hearts to foster care and adop-tion. I was proud to nominate James and Angie as ‘‘Angels in Adoption,’’ an award by the Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute. It recognizes individuals, couples, and organi-zations who improve the lives of children in need of families. The Sessions family is more than deserving of this recognition. After learning about foster care at a local church camp for children in state custody, James and Angie were inspired to become foster parents. While they were providing foster care for four siblings—three young brothers and their baby sister—James and Angie were determined to keep the sib-lings together. In August of 2017, the Sessions family grew from 2 to 6 when Ajay, Nathan, Kyler, and Layla found their forever home with James and Angie in Pasco, Washington. Thank you, James and Angie, for your love and dedication to children in Central Wash-ington.

HONORING THE SERVICE OF RONALD E. LAWSON 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 12, 2018 Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the service of Ronald E. Lawson. Mr. Lawson honorably served in the United States Army for twenty years, touring in Korea, Ger-many, and Vietnam. Ronald ‘‘Ron’’ E. Lawson was born in Los Angeles and, in 1959, at age seventeen, he enlisted in the Army, completing his basic training at Fort Ord. He was then sent to Korea as a member of the 1st Cavalry with duties in the DMZ. Upon completion of his tour, he was posted to Germany, serving five years with the First ARB 46th Infantry and the 24th Infantry Division. After returning to the US as a weapons in-structor, Ron was called up for his second tour in Korea, this time serving a year with the famed 7th Cavalry with the 2nd Infantry Divi-sion at the DMZ. Ron was later selected to attend the Drill Sergeant Academy at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, earning the distinction of Honor Graduate. After graduation, Ron was deployed to Vietnam as part of Military Assistance Com-mand. He worked with South Vietnamese Re-gional Forces in the Central Highlands of II Corps, providing instruction and tactical advice to regional soldiers, accompanying them on jungle operations. After twelve months in Vietnam, Ron as-sumed duties as a drill sergeant for new re-cruits at Fort Ord, later returning to Germany as operations sergeant with the 1st Armored Division. He deployed in 1961 and 1964 for the Berlin Crisis and to Greece and Cyprus in 1962. He once more returned to Fort Ord to serve with the 7th Light Infantry Division. After twenty years of service, Ron retired with the rank of First Sergeant. For his serv-ice, Ron Lawson was awarded the Bronze Star, Army Meritorious Service Medal, Army Commendation Medal, Vietnam Cross of Gal-lantry with Gold Star, Vietnam Service Medal, Vietnam Campaign Medal with Device, Army of Occupation Medal, Armed Forces Expedi-tionary Medal, Korean Service Medal, National Defense Service Medal and the Combat Infan-try Badge. Additionally, Ron received six let-ters of commendation and was selected Drill Sergeant of the Year. After retirement from the Army, Ron and his family settled in Chowchilla, California. Work-ing as a maintenance supervisor, Ron served on the City of Chowchilla Planning Commis-sion for twenty-one years. He is a Life Mem-ber and past commander of VFW Post 9896 and American Legion Post 148. Ron attends St. Columba Catholic Church and is a member of the Young Men’s Institute. Ron and his wife, Mathilde, have two children and two grandchildren. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to the service of Ronald E.

COME AND TAKE IT: GONZALES, TEXAS, 1835 
HON. TED POE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 12, 2018 Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the phrase ‘‘Come and Take It’’ is known and cherished by all Texans. You’ll see it emblazoned on t- shirts, bumper stickers, and glassware, and some businesses and organizations have adapted it to fit into their mottos and slogans. But these four words were not the creation of an advertising firm or a campaign commu-nications shop. No, this phrase comes from a critical chapter in the history of Texas. The year was 1835. Independence from Mexico was on the mind of Texans, and dis-cussions had already begun to create a new nation free from the tyrannical government of Santa Anna in Mexico City. Santa Anna’s gov-ernment had begun to trample on the rights of Texans, who then became resolved to stand up to him. An opportunity presented itself in October 1835 when a band of Mexican soldiers under the command of Fernando Castaneda were dispatched to Gonzales. The Mexican govern-ment had been informed that the settlers there were refusing to give up a cannon given to the town to defend the settlers from Indian at-tacks. The settlers responded to requests to return the cannon to the Mexican army with strong words that only a Texian would utter: ‘‘come and take it.’’ So Domingo de Ugartechea, military commander of Texas, be-lieving the settlers words were bluster, ordered Castaneda and his men to retrieve it. Well, Santa Anna never did learn the les-sons of history. If he had, he might have re-membered that things did not go well for King George when he tried to disarm the colonists in Massachusetts and he maybe would have thought twice about marching his henchman up to Texas. When Castaneda arrived at Gonzales, he found his path blocked by a ford and eighteen determined militiamen. Attempting to trick his way past the guards, he declared that he had a message for Andrew Ponton, the local al-calde. The militiamen informed him that Ponton was not in Gonzales and would have to wait on the other side of the river until he returned. As the Mexican troops set up camp, the Texans scrambled to alert the surrounding area and bring more volunteers into the town to defend it from an impending Mexican at-tack. The militiamen, who came to be known as the Old Eighteen, bought valuable time for the town and for Texas. Indeed, the presence of incoming volunteers forced Castaneda to abandon his campsite at the river and move seven miles to the west. Bolstered with rein-forcements and a growing confidence, the Texans under the command of John Moore found the Mexican camp and attacked. Stunned and outgunned, Castaneda ordered a withdrawal to Bexar, thus marking the first vic-tory won against Mexico in the fight for inde-pendence. It was during this battle that the phrase ‘‘Come and Take It’’ took on its significance. During the battle, the Texans marched under a new flag that featured the Lone Star, a can-non representing the one under guard in Gonzales, and the words ’’Come and Take It.’’ Today, Texans take pride in this enduring symbol of the Texan spirit, and if you happen to walk past my office window in Washington, you will see this flag proudly displayed next to the Lone Star flag. Mr. Speaker, in Texas, we have a long tra-dition of fighting against oppression and tyr-anny. So when our enemies come knocking on our doors again threatening our freedom, let them remember these words: Come and Take It. And that is just the way it is.
