COMMENDING TIMOTHY FESKO FOR HIS LIFETIME OF PUBLIC SERVICE 
HON. PETER J. VISCLOSKY 
OF INDIANA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 16, 2018 Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, it is with great respect and admiration that I take this time to recognize Timothy Fesko, former Indi-ana State Representative, who was recently appointed by Governor Eric Holcomb as the new chairman of the Gary/Chicago Inter-national Airport Authority. Tim’s remarkable career and his years of selfless public service to the community of Northwest Indiana and beyond are truly admirable and worthy of the highest commendation. Timothy Fesko graduated from Indiana Uni-versity in 1965, where he earned a bachelor’s degree in business and economics. In the pri-vate sector, Tim has had a very successful ca-reer as a business agent in real estate and in-surance with the Don Powers Agency. In 1990, Mr. Fesko’s desire to serve his commu-nity led him to run for office, and he was elect-ed to the Indiana House of Representatives. Representative Fesko would serve in this ca-pacity until stepping down in 1998. Tim Fesko is a man of vision. For example, he saw the value of extending and improving the South Shore Commuter Line long before others. He also works hard throughout North-west Indiana and across the state. Mr. Fesko has served as chairman of the Lake County Advancement Center for many years, and he was appointed by former Governor Mitch Dan-iels to serve on the Indiana Gaming Commis-sion, a position he held for one term. Mr. Fesko continues to use his expertise and knowledge for the betterment of Northwest In-diana, and I wish him well on his newly ap-pointed position as chairman of the Gary/Chi-cago International Airport Authority. Throughout his career, Timothy Fesko has generously served his community by giving of his time and efforts to various organizations and civic activities that work to improve the quality of life for Northwest Indiana residents, including the Northwest Indiana Forum, Boy Scouts of America, Rotary Club of Munster, Tradewinds Rehabilitation Center, YMCA, Indi-ana Society of Chicago, Campagna Academy, and Crisis Center, Incorporated, to name a few. For his exceptional devotion to these ear-nest causes, Tim was awarded the prestigious Sagamore of the Wabash Award in 2000 by Governor Frank O’Bannon, and in 2008 by Governor Mitch Daniels. Tim’s dedication to his community and state is exceeded only by his devotion to his won-derful family. He and his amazing wife, Frankie, have three children, Heather, Don, and Tim, and six beloved grandchildren, who are carrying on his family legacy. I am proud that Tim Fesko is my friend, and I cannot thank him enough for all that he has done for me over the years. I am even more grateful for what he has done for so many for so long, strangers and friends alike. His is a life we should all seek to emulate. Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring Timothy Fesko for his lifetime of service. I would also like to wish him well on his newly appointed position with the Gary/Chicago International Airport Authority. For Mr. Fesko’s truly remarkable career and his outstanding dedication to his community, he is worthy of our sincere appreciation.

HONORING ROCHELLE SHERLOCK WITH CALIFORNIA’S THIRD DIS-TRICT WOMAN OF THE YEAR AWARD 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 16, 2018 Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Rochelle Sherlock as a woman of the year. She is passionately devoted to improving her community both through her career and volunteerism. Ms. Sherlock co-founded the Senior Coalition of Solano County, a volunteer based group which advises the Solano County Board of Supervisors on how best to serve the senior community. She has also been an in-valuable part of my Senior Advisory Group where she has played an essential role in in-creasing my awareness and understanding of the critical issues facing seniors in our com-munity. As co-founder of the Solano Commis-sion for Women and Girls, she advanced the goal of improving the economic status, health and social welfare, and overall quality of life for women and girls in Solano County. She is also a founding member of 100 Women Who Care, a philanthropic organization which pro-vides financial support for local charities doing important work. She also co-founded the first Solano County Volunteer Center and is a member of the Volunteer Center of the Bay Area Board. Ms. Sherlock has done extensive volunteer work in service to her community while maintaining her role as the founder and CEO of Potentiate, a consulting firm for private companies, government, and non-profit organi-zations. She also does pro-bono consulting work for dozens of local non-profits and civic leaders that has greatly enhanced their ability to more efficiently serve the needs of our com-munity. The significant positive impact Ro-chelle Sherlock has had on this community cannot be overstated, and she is extremely worthy of this recognition. SHERIFF DOMINIC MATTIVI TRIBUTE HON. SCOTT R. TIPTON 
OF COLORADO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 16, 2018 Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Sheriff Dominic Mattivi, Jr. for his 27 years of service to the Ouray County Sheriff’s Department as he prepares for retirement. Sheriff Mattivi began his career with the Ouray County Sheriff’s Department as a Dep-uty Sheriff, and became Sheriff in 2001. With Ouray County at the beginning of the ‘‘Million Dollar Highway,’’ Sheriff Mattivi has been on the scene of many accidents and rescues over the years and has impacted many lives. Sher-iff Mattivi’s job has certainly not been easy, but throughout his career he has always risen to the occasion as a dedicated and profes-sional lawman. His work and commitment to Ouray County has never wavered and he has become one of the most respected members of the community. His service goes beyond working hours, and when he’s not on the job Sheriff Mattivi can often be found volunteering in his community. He has spent 35 years with the Ouray Volun-teer Fire Department, including 20 years with the Ouray County Extrication Team. Addition-ally, he has worked as a volunteer for the local Red Cross, taught CPR classes, trained lifeguards at the Ouray Hot Springs Pool and annually donated his efforts to ensure the fire-work displays were properly put together on the Fourth of July and New Year’s Eve. The Ouray community has been truly fortunate to have Sheriff Mattivi looking out for its safety and working to make it the vibrant community that it is. Mr. Speaker, Sheriff Mattivi has dutifully served the Ouray community and his dedica-tion will be remembered. It is my privilege to recognize him for the important work he has done throughout his life and I wish him all the best in his retirement.

Lewis And Wilkins in Indianapolis. Indianapolis Monthly characterized Paul last month as a long-time supporter of the city’s art commu-nity. Kathryn’s paternal grandparents are Pat and Val Mullin, retired, and residents of Nash-ville, Indiana. Pat had a career in sales and Val was a high school English teacher. Kathryn’s maternal great-grandfather, Charles Richard Paul, 96 years old, originally from Evansville, is still an active stockbroker and will be teaching Kathryn the importance of trading with puts and calls starting in a few years. Although she does not realize it yet, Kathryn’s best friend is Noor, the family dog. I congratulate the entire Mullin family on the birth of Kathryn and wish her a long, happy life.

SALVADORAN ARCHIBISHOP OSCAR ROMERO: A SAINT FOR ALL OF US 
HON. JAMES P. McGOVERN 
OF MASSACHUSETTS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 16, 2018 Mr. M
CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, on Sunday, October 14, the Vatican officially canonized Salvadoran Archbishop Oscar Romero, who was assassinated on March 24, 1980, on the eve of El Salvador’s 12-year civil war. In a ceremony presided over by Pope Francis, the first pope from Latin America, Ro-mero will become a saint alongside Pope Paul VI, Italian priests Francesco Spinelli and Vincenzo Romano, German nun Maria Caterina Kasper, and Spanish nun Nazaria Ignazia. The canonizations will take place at the Vatican during the 2018 Synod of Bishops, a meeting of bishops from around the world that this year will address the topic of young people, who were much beloved by Arch-bishop Romero. In attendance will be many Salvadorans and Latin Americans, including a delegation from the United States who are current bene-ficiaries of Temporary Protected Status (TPS), an immigration status, which President Trump has stripped from over 260,000 Salvadorans currently residing legally in the United States because it’s simply too dangerous for them to return home. In May 2015, I had the privilege of attending the beatification of Romero in San Salvador. Surrounded by many high religious and gov-ernment officials, especially from Latin Amer-ica, I was most moved by the hundreds of thousands of ordinary Salvadorans, many who had traveled for days from rural areas to at-tend this special mass. While they likely would have preferred to see him canonized in his home country, they can only be overjoyed that the name and message of ‘‘Saint Romero of the Americas’’ will now be shared with the world. As a Catholic, I am proud of my Church for finally recognizing this man of God who lived his faith. As a politician, I continue to be in-spired by Romero’s example—his total com-mitment to the poor and his unwavering com-mitment to the dignity of every human being. Romero was shot through the heart by a sniper while celebrating mass in the chapel of the Hospital of Divine Providence, a church- run hospital in San Salvador specializing in cancer and care of the terminally ill, which still operates today and maintains as a shrine the humble dwelling where Romero resided on their grounds. He was murdered the day after he called on the Salvadoran military to stop killing innocent civilians at the beginning of El Salvador’s civil war. The U.N. Truth Commission, created as part of the negotiations that ended that war, determined that Roberto D’Aubuisson, a former army major and founder of the right- wing ARENA political party, coordinated a death squad and ordered the assassination. Romero’s calls to end the violence afflicting his nation and his solidarity with El Salvador’s poor appealed to me as a college student in the late 1970s. I still remember learning about his murder and believing that this terrible crime would result in the termination of U.S. aid to a government and military that per-secuted social justice activists and had no re-spect for human rights. Sadly, it did not. The U.S. continued to finance the Salva-doran armed forces for the next decade. While Congress expressed concern about human rights issues, it wasn’t until Congressman Joe Moakley courageously offered and Congress passed an amendment in 1990 to cut aid that the blank check stopped. And that was after the deaths of nearly 80,000 civilians, the mur-der of human rights defenders, labor leaders, nuns and then six Jesuit priests and two women in 1989. I traveled to El Salvador many times during the 1980s and saw first-hand the brutality of the Salvadoran govern-ment and military supported by my govern-ment. I felt ashamed. Reagan and Bush Administration officials routinely turned a blind eye to torture, dis-appearances and murder. They characterized anyone who questioned the human rights record of the Salvadoran government as an ally of the Faribundo Marti National Liberation Army (FMLN)—the armed opposition. They belittled and tried to discredit those—like Ro-mero and the Jesuits—who dared to speak the truth. For Romero, the truth about El Salvador came later in his life, as he rose in the Church hierarchy. In the mid-1970s, he served as bishop of the rural diocese of Santiago de Maria, where the gap between coffee planta-tion and other landowners and campesinos was obvious. He saw for himself the suffering and cruel repression of the poor, which af-fected him deeply and triggered a process of reflection and change. This process cul-minated in the 1977 assassination of his close friend, Jesuit priest Rutilio Grande, who em-braced liberation theology, which puts the poor and the oppressed first and prioritizes the con-crete defense of their rights. After Grande’s murder, Romero said, ‘‘When I look at Rutilio lying dead I thought, ’If they have killed him for doing what he did, then I, too, have to walk the same path.’ ’’ Indeed, Romero believed ‘‘those committed to the poor must share the same fate as the poor.’’ Romero became a voice for those who had no voice; he preached that everyone was im-portant. He embodied hope for the millions of people in El Salvador who were forgotten and the targets of repression. In his diaries, he wrote: ‘‘Between the powerful and the wealthy, and the poor and vulnerable, who should a pastor side with? I have no doubts. A pastor should stay with his people.’’ To his dying day, Archbishop Romero called on us to unite in love for the poor, the marginalized and the forgotten. The ceremony this weekend will finally recognize him as a saint. It offers all of us an opportunity not only to reflect on Romero’s life, but also to commit ourselves to policies aimed at peace, human rights, alleviating poverty and promoting non- violence in El Salvador and around the world. The sad fact is that El Salvador and the international community have largely failed in transforming Romero’s words into action. We continue to witness thousands of young chil-dren and families fleeing Central American countries as a result of violence and extreme poverty. Even in the United States, the gap between the rich and the poor continues to grow and justice on too many occasions fails to work for those who are most disadvan-taged. Hundreds of millions around the world are hungry—even though hunger is a solvable problem; and war and violence too often seem to be the first choice to deal with conflicts. I am hopeful that the power of Romero’s message can inspire new activism on behalf of the marginalized and the poor and a better understanding of their plight and struggles—in El Salvador, the United States and around the world. Romero reminded us, ‘‘There are many things that can only be seen through eyes that have cried.’’ With his canonization, we have an opportunity to renew our commitment and honor his legacy by giving a voice to the per-secuted, the poor and neglected in every na-tion. Now is the time to stand on the right side of history and help those who need it most.

HONORING SALLY SERGER WITH CALIFORNIA’S THIRD DISTRICT WOMAN OF THE YEAR AWARD 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 16, 2018 Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Sally Serger as a woman of the year. As a dedicated educator who is passionate about her family and community, Ms. Sally Serger has devoted over 25 years of her life to teaching deaf and hard-of-hearing special- needs children in Oroville for the Sutter Coun-ty Office of Education. With her persistence and positivity, she has been able to touch the lives of countless children who otherwise might not receive the patient care and instruc-tion so critical to their development. It is a point of pride for Ms. Serger when she has the opportunity to interact with the students who she has seen grow into successful young adults throughout her career. Ms. Serger also spends time volunteering in myriad other ca-pacities throughout her community. She is a member of the California Women for Agri-culture, the La Porte Snowmobile Club, and has served for over 30 years as a project and community leader for the renowned 4–H Pro-gram. When one considers that 4–H seeks to engage youth in reaching their fullest potential, it is no surprise to learn that Ms. Serger has chosen to spend her time with this organiza-tion. In addition to her work as an educator, Ms. Serger has been a consistent force in im-proving the western bank of the Feather River, and by diligently advocating for her commu-nity, she became instrumental in securing local funding for the strengthening of Sutter

CONSTITUENT COMMENTS ON SOBER LIVING HOME PROBLEMS 
HON. DANA ROHRABACHER 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 16, 2018 Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, I rise again regarding the hearing held by the Judici-ary Subcommittee on the Constitution and Civil Justice on September 28, 2018 on the issue of sober living homes. At that hearing, I had the privilege of testifying in support of my bill, H.R. 5724, to restore local oversight over sober living homes. As part of my testimony, I submitted to the Subcommittee letters from many of my constituents about problems with sober living homes caused by current federal law preventing appropriate local oversight. For the benefit of my colleagues and the American people, I include in the R
ECORD the fourth group of these constituent letters below: 
A sober living home was across the street from me and my family for one year. Three more were around the block from me and those residents did not have parking. Our street was filled with parked cars going di-rectly into these sober living homes. In addi-tion, our streets were constantly littered with trash, needles & cigarette buds. Since friends of SLHs are not allowed to go within a certain distance to the SLH property, young male adults would sit under my bas-ketball hoop smoking cigarettes in front of my then 12 and 10-year-old kids, waiting for the occupants to come outside. The police were called on at least 3 occasions with prob-lems with the house across from me, and nu-merous occasions with the homes around the block. I have witnessed 3 clients of SLHs being taken away on stretchers in ambu-lances, with police involvement. Young adults who relapse or are kicked out of SLHs run amok through our residential streets breaking into cars and houses, buying and selling drugs in our neighborhoods filled with children. The amount of SLHs in Costa Mesa are a major problem, just ask our CMPD and businesses throughout our city. Our CM City Council wants to reduce the amount of SLHs in residential neighborhoods based on complaints from residents and busi-nesses. Every city should have a say in this and be able to vote on local ordinances. Thank you in advance for considering this bill. K
EITH FRAINIE , Costa Mesa, California. 
The house next door to me was purchased by an investor who owned numerous sober living facilities in Costa Mesa and through-out Orange County. His company name was [REDACTED]. The owner is [NAME]. He re-modeled the home and told me he was going to sell it. He rented it to a chain of rehab lo-cations [REDACTED] that was finally ex-posed as fraudulent and closed. Then rented it again to another rehab company. In 7 years I was victimized as a single senior who had been a resident for 25 years in the same location. Constant turmoil, chain smoking, profanity, etc. I reported all to the state, code enforcement, and city officials. My health was seriously affected to the point of surgery and trauma therapy. I tried to pay for 1/2 of a block wall, to rent the house to another tenant, and pleaded to no avail with the owner. All of the complaints are on record even the meetings in person with the owner of the rehab with code enforcement. I was told my property value had decreased by 40–60% because of the neighbors. There are numerous empty commercial facilities that can be used for this purpose. As a volunteer for [REDACTED] for 30 years I empathize with their cause, but not at the cost of seri-ous illness and trauma to their neighbors. Contact numbers provided were not an-swered, staff was transient and unavailable, even the state Department of Health said they would not come from Sacramento to in-vestigate and even if they did they would not be able to catch them in the act. Please for all parties concerned confine rehab facilities to commercial buildings not to residential neighborhoods. Thank you. MARILYN BROOKS , Costa Mesa, California. 
I like to share with Congress that my rep-resentative, Dana Rohrabacher, is mis-leading his constituency once again. He has neglected to share the first line of the sum-mary with us and is trying to create a law to pander to his base. The summary reads: Shown Here: Introduced in House (05/09/ 2018) Restoring Community Oversight of Sober Living Homes Act of 2018. This bill amends the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to remove substance use disorder services from the list of essen-tial health benefits that must be covered by health plans. The bill also amends the Fair Housing Act to address state and local zoning laws re-garding recovery facilities (buildings that are occupied by individuals who are handi-capped by drug addiction or alcoholism and that prohibit controlled substances and alco-hol). The bill specifies that federal anti-dis-crimination laws do not bar any state or local zoning laws that prohibit recovery fa-cilities in residential areas. Recovery facili-ties must also comply with all state and local zoning laws in order to receive federal funds. I do not approve of this bill or my rep-resentative. I look forward to my story being inserted into the hearing record and the Congres-sional Record. Or is that just for people who agree with you? D
EBORAH WILDER , Westminster, California. 
My husband and I bought our house in 2001 and have lived here ever since. In fact, I grew up in this tract in a home on the other side of [REDACTED] Middle School, as have many of the neighbors. I can tell you it is a quiet, safe neighborhood where people take care of their homes and generally take pride in their surroundings. This past April the house next door sold [REDACTED], owned by [NAME], and turned into what we later learned was a Sober Living house, registered for up to five females. In reality, the house is less of a sober living house and more of a quasi ‘‘half-way house’’/‘‘drug house’’. The house is a 5 bedroom/2 bath house with a two-car garage. What initially started as more of an inconvenience due to the mul-tiple cars coming and going, blocking our drive way, and actually backing into my 77- year old mothers car when she came to visit, has turned into something much more dis-turbing. Several of the initial residents who portrayed themselves to my husband as a couple of college students and friends, have long since moved out. Multiple other resi-dents have arrived, stayed a few days, and left. Aside from overgrown grass, their dogs left outside overnight barking incessantly, and visitors at all hours of the night, the sit-uation has grown more concerning. In the early morning hours of Friday, Au-gust 24th, the neighborhood was awoken to multiple police cars in the area, two to three at any time parked in front of my house with lights flashing as they are interviewing one of the primary residents next door as an ap-parent drug sale went bad. This carried on for several hours as helicopters hovered over the neighborhood looking for several people that took off on foot. We later learned that several of these individuals were running from back yard to back yard down the street, knocking on windows, causing fear in the neighborhood. We later learned the next morning looking at video from our Arlo cam-eras that one of the individuals involved ac-tually walked up to our front door and at-tempted to knock, before leaving. We also learned after looking at video taken from the neighbors across the street that a white truck carrying several of the individuals in-volved with the incident actually pulled into our driveway. This video was offered to the police and our video of the evening was for-warded to HBPD referencing Incident [RE-DACTED]. Whether they confused our house with the next-door house, or whether they meant to pull in to our driveway we will never know. But nonetheless, having some-one pull into your driveway, drop off several people looking to either buy or sell or use drugs, walk up to your doorstep and then proceed to try and disrupt your neighbor-hood by running through backyards in the middle of the night is unacceptable. In addition to pulling into our driveway and trespassing through our yard and at-tempting to knock on our door in the middle of the night, several people were discovered on the street adjacent to our house appar-ently using narcotics. Upon police arrival, they ran leaving an amount of narcotics deemed trafficking. One of the individuals trespassed across our property in an attempt to evade the police only to drop his wallet on our front yard and a compact multi-use tool with hammer on our driveway. HBPD gath-ered the evidence from us the following morning after we reported it. In summary, in the four short months since [NAME] (address listed at [ADDRESS]) has owned the home and chosen to take on the liability associated with renting his property out as a quasi ‘‘Sober Living’’/ ‘‘Halfway House’’/‘‘Drug House’’, the situa-tion has escalated from being that of a nui-sance to being criminal and having the very likely probability of negatively impacting property values, endangering children at [REDACTED] Middle School just around the corner and if not stopped, being the begin-ning of blight in Huntington Beach.

I have seen the city of Costa Mesa go from a friendly, safe, community neighborhood when I grew up during the 70’s and 80’s to a drug and homeless infested area that is al-most unrecognizable. I cannot believe our local government has no power in regulating the number of sober living homes. Please take a moment to check for how many SLH are in just Costa Mesa. There needs to be a way where the drug users can get help but not at the expense of the local residents. By allowing such a large concentration of SLH’s in the city I fear for the safety of children and women. Please allow the local govern-ment to set standards and volume of SLH’s allowed. When the patient is being treated at a SLH if their treatment fails or if their money runs out they are often displaced onto the streets of the city they are housed in. Just knowing this you can imagine how many homeless people in Costa Mesa come from these homes. That does not allow for the fact of how noisy, dirty, and unsafe these

homes can be. Please fight for the average citizen by allowing local governments to es-tablish limits and guidelines for all SLH’s to follow. Don’t forget us the average, tax pay-ing citizen. J
EFFREY FREI, Costa Mesa, California. 
I submit my testimony from the perspec-tive of a registered nurse. I have worked at a local hospital for many years, where I have taken care of patients who resided at a local sober living facility. They were always from out of state, citing that Costa Mesa and the surrounding area are the Mecca for sober liv-ing facilities, providing verification for the ‘‘recruitment’’ process to our city. As a nurse, I confirm that we do a dis-service to the sober living residents by not maintaining and demanding stricter regula-tion, assessment, and regular evaluation. The hospital must submit to regular inspec-tion and regulation. Why should the sober living facilities not be held to the same level of standard, where they are equally respon-sible for the welfare and care of their cli-ents? By allowing lax guidelines and loop-holes like the Fair Housing Act to protect the owners, the vulnerable clients do not re-ceive the care they need to succeed in their programs but instead end up in situations where they are allowed to engage in activi-ties that harm their recovery and subject neighborhoods to various levels of harm as well. In regard to those clients who fail their programs and become homeless in our com-munity, an added level of public health issues is created. Better policies and procedures must be put in place to allow our local government to regulate the sober living facilities and pro-vide the authority to help those in need without jeopardizing the health of the cli-ents and our city as a whole. L
AURI MCMILLEN , Costa Mesa, California. 
Many Thanks Dana Rohrabacher for cham-pioning this awful situation local residents are in. There are far too many mid 20-year old persons walking the streets mid-day wearing back backs on a daily basis. I can also tell they are not local residents. We’ve had a bike stolen since living in Costa Mesa. Lived in Newport Beach for 30 years without a problem. I pay approximately $14,000 annu-ally in property taxes and do not feel safe in my own Costa Mesa community. People ap-proaching me at gas stations asking for money. It’s scary. C

EASTLAND TEXAS’ OWN, CLIFTON A. HORN 
HON. TED POE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 16, 2018 Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the small rural Texas town of Eastland is the home of Clifton A. Horn who was born there 92 years ago on October 24th. After graduating from high school in 1943, he worked in the ship-yards building destroyer escorts for the U.S. Navy in Orange, Texas. In 1944, the Colonel, as he is known to all, was inducted into the Army Air Corps as an aviation cadet training to be a multiengine pilot. However, World War II ended before he was able to serve. The Colonel returned to Texas to attend the University of Houston where he served as a judge on the Student Court, as president of his fraternity, and as a member of the student government. Colonel Horn worked to establish the ROTC program at the University of Hous-ton and was in the first class of members who graduated from the program at the University of Houston. His portrait still hangs on the wall in the ROTC office. While attending the University of Houston, Clifton was a volunteer that fought the fire caused by a fertilizer explosion on the S.S. Grandcamp, a French freighter. The explosion obliterated Texas City, killing nearly 600 peo-ple, and lifting ships directly out of the water. The Texas City Disaster of April 1947 was the largest non-nuclear explosion killing hundreds and destroying the docks. After graduating from the University of Houston, he was commissioned as a 2nd Lieutenant and called to active duty. The Colo-nel then served in the 7th Field Artillery of the Big Red One 1st Infantry, attended Basic Offi-cers Course, and then served as a Company Commander in Korea’s 142nd Quartermasters Battalion, then served as a Group Commander at Ft. Bragg. He served all over Germany, Eu-rope, Japan and the United States. During this time, he also graduated from the United States Army War College. Colonel Horn’s decorated career continued as he served as an advisor to the Vietnamese Army during his first tour of Vietnam. During his second tour, he commanded a firebase as a battalion commander in the 1st Cavalry Divi-sion Airmobile. After his final tour in Vietnam, Colonel Horn was transferred to Washington, D.C. to serve in the Immediate Office of the Assistant to the Secretary of the Army. It was during this time that he was promoted to full Colonel. In 1972, he was transferred to Germany as the Commander of the US Army Procurement Agency Europe. The Colonel retired in 1978 after honorably serving his nation for over 30 years. He can now be found most days on the golf course or playing gin or poker in the lock-er room of the Atascocita Country Club. Clif-ton’s daughter-in-law, Tonia Horn, a United States Air Force Veteran, is a member of my Texas staff. For all of his world travels, the Colonel is happiest when surrounded by his wife of 62 years, three children, seven grand-children and nine great grandchildren. Happy golfing, Colonel Horn. Your bravery and courage has helped make our nation a safer place. And that is just the way it is. f

The Northern In-diana Area Labor Federation, American Fed-eration of Labor—Congress of Industrial Orga-nizations (AFL–CIO), will recognize several in-dividuals and organizations for their dedication and service during the Northern Indiana Area Labor Federation Community Labor Awards Reception, which will be held at Duneland Falls Banquet Center in Chesterton, Indiana, on Thursday, October 18, 2018. These individ-uals, in addition to all Northern Indiana Area Labor Federation members who have served Northwest Indiana so diligently for such a long period of time, are the epitome of the ideal American worker: loyal, dedicated, and hard-working. At this year’s event, several individuals and organizations will receive special recognition. North Township Trustee Frank J. Mrvan will be the recipient of the Service to Labor Award for his many years of support to the labor movement and his outstanding dedication to union members. The Union Labor Award will be presented to Ryan Reithel, Business Manager, IBEW Local 697, for his unselfish devotion to the labor movement through its promotion in all areas: social, civic, educational, and political. The Chicago UAW—Ford Community Serv-ice Team will be recognized with the Commu-nity Services Award for its exemplary work on behalf of the community and to the enhance-ment of the quality of life for residents and visitors of Northwest Indiana. Lorenzo Crowell, Jr., SEIU Healthcare IN/IL, will be honored with the Lifetime Achievement Award for his many years of labor activism and his commitment to his community. For the exceptional service he has provided to the people of Northwest Indiana, he is worthy of our admiration and respect. Tom Schmitt, USW 7–1, will be presented the George Meany Award for his significant contributions to the youth of our communities through his involvement with the Boy Scouts of America. The President’s Award will be presented to Indiana State Senator Karen Tallian and Indi-ana State Representative Chuck Moseley for their dedication to the labor movement and their noteworthy service to the organization. They are truly worthy of the honors bestowed upon them. Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my distin-guished colleagues join me in congratulating these dedicated, honorable, and exemplary citizens, while commending all of the hard-working union men and women throughout America. They have shown commitment and courage toward their pursuits, and I am proud to represent each of them in Washington, D.C. f

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 16, 2018 Mr. LONG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the work of New Covenant Academy, located in Springfield, Missouri. New Covenant Academy was founded in 1979 by a group of parents and grandparents, who wanted to afford their children the right to a Christian education. This dedicated group could not have imagined that after 40 years in operation, the school would grow from 22 en-rolled students during the first year, to 650 this academic year. It is fitting, that to celebrate their 40th Anniversary, New Covenant Acad-emy will open a second campus, providing a new home to the 5th through 8th grade class-es.

The mission statement of New Covenant Academy is simple, ‘‘New Covenant Academy is a Christian college preparatory school com-mitted to achieving Academic Excellence teaching Biblical Truth and developing Christ- like Character for students grades JRK through 12th grade in the greater Springfield area.’’ This is what that small group of dedi-cated parents wanted and envisioned when they set out to open this school in 1979. Mr. Speaker, New Covenant Academy has served the Springfield area for the past 40 years. Over that time, they have provided Christian education to many students, and making a lasting impact on the lives of all who walk through their doors. They have achieved their goal through hard work and faith. I am pleased to rise today, honoring a truly tremen-dous school.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate the Voca-tional Development Center (Vodec) of Council Bluffs, Iowa. This year marks the 50th year of operations for the Center, which opened its doors in 1968. Vodec was founded in Council Bluffs and employs nearly 380 people. This non-profit began as an advocacy group to provide a structured, safe, and sheltered work environ-ment for children graduating from high school with disabilities. Since then, the organization has expanded into Nebraska and eastern Iowa and offers a variety of services including resi-dent support, employment, job placement, and day habilitation. Steve Hodapp, Chief Execu-tive Officer for Vodec said, ‘‘As the need for different services arises, we can respond to that. Our strategic plan is designed around being responsive to need. That’s what our growth is all about.’’ Mr. Speaker, I commend and congratulate the Vocational Development Center and its staff for providing cutting-edge services to dis-abled individuals in the Council Bluffs area, Nebraska, and throughout eastern Iowa for the past 50 years. I urge my colleagues in the United States Congress to join me in con-gratulating Vodec for their numerous achieve-ments in helping those with disabilities. I wish Vodec and all of their employees continued success in the future.

HON. TODD ROKITA 
OF INDIANA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 16, 2018 Mr. ROKITA. Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday, Oc-tober 16, 2018, The Honor Flight of Greater Lafayette will host its twenty-second and final trip escorting America’s Hoosier veterans to Washington, DC, to visit memorials dedicated to honor their service. I rise today to recognize this exceptional organization and the two re-markable women who have dedicated their hearts to its success. Organization founders Pam Mow and Dana Vann are Gold Star Mothers. Dana’s son Sen-ior Airman John Morton, Jr., lost his life in Italy while serving in the Air Force on September 3, 2002. He was 22 years old. On April 12, 2007, Pam Mow lost her son Army Corporal Cody Putnam when he died in combat during Oper-ation Iraqi Freedom. He was 22 years old. These women have already sacrificed so much, yet for the past seven years, they have chosen to honor the lives and service of vet-erans through the Honor Flight of Greater La-fayette. The first honor flight from Lafayette, Indiana, took place on April 16, 2012. Since that time over 1,800 veterans have departed the Purdue University Airport to arrive in Washington, D.C., where they and their guardians were able to visit the war memorials and the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington Cemetery. Veterans have told me that viewing the monu-ments, which honor their service, is a very moving experience. Additionally, they really enjoyed receiving letters of appreciation from relatives, friends, and school children at ‘‘Mail Call’’ and being greeted by hundreds of patri-otic, flag-waving Americans on the tarmac when their plane returned to Lafayette. One veteran expressed to me, ‘‘It was the best day of my life.’’ These once in a lifetime Hoosier veteran ex-periences are because of the dedication, lead-ership, and work of Pam Mow and Dana Vann. I wish to express my heartfelt gratitude and appreciation for their service to veterans and the community-at-large. It is truly an honor to congratulate them for the twenty-two successful trips of The Honor Flight of Greater Lafayette. May God bless Pam and Dana as they go forward with their lives. f 
HONORING SARA SEALANDER WITH CALIFORNIA’S THIRD DIS-TRICT WOMAN OF THE YEAR AWARD 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 16, 2018 Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Sara Sealander as a woman of the year. She is an artist, educator, and activist. She taught both Art History and Studio Art classes fulltime at Yuba Community College for 38 years and continues her work teaching as an adjunct professor of Art History. She has long been the leading voice for women in the arts in her community. She created the curriculum for the Women in the Arts classes she teaches, and which are now taught in other schools. She has mentored a whole generation of artists and art instructors in her community and remains passionate about the role of arts in education and society. Ms. Sealander’s skill and passion for the arts goes beyond her work into activism. Fueled by threats to eliminate the National Endowment for the Arts, she organized public protests to educate the public about the importance of the NEA to society and its impact in our local community. She also founded a local chapter of Guerilla Girls, an international group of feminist activist artists who use their artistic talents to make social commentary. Ms. Sealander’s activism works to promote the im-portance of art to community and society. She continues to be an inspiration to young artists and the next generation of arts instructors at all levels of education in the Yuba-Sutter com-munity. She generously gives her time to cu-rate an annual Art Faculty Art show and has devoted many hours to the Yuba College Fine Arts Alumni group. She makes time to mentor graduates, ensuring that the value of art in her community will never be lost. She has devoted her career to promoting the arts and without her devotion to the importance of art, the artis-tic community of the Yuba-Sutter area would not be what it is today.

GREEN BERET SERGEANT FIRST CLASS CALVIN B. HARRISON COLDSPRING, TEXAS 
HON. TED POE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 16, 2018 Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the Green Berets are a special type of soldier. You have to be the best of the best: smart, tough, and an almost supernatural strength of will. Their qualification and training process is the tough-est in the business—not just anyone can be a Green Beret. Everything is tested, from your language ability to physical fitness to your most basic but most difficult task: survival. They push you to your max and when you are just about to break, they push you harder. The training is so hard because they know what you are going to face: impossible, top-secret missions that must be done. But when you get through it all you have a physical and mental toughness that can survive even the most ex-treme conditions. You are not just a soldier— you are a true warrior. That’s what Sergeant First Class Calvin B. Harrison was: a true warrior. Harrison’s awards and decorations include the Purple Heart, the Meritorious Service Medal, Bronze Star Medal, Army Commendation Medal, two Army Achievement Medals, Army Good Con-duct Medal, National Defense Service Medal, Kosovo Campaign Medal, Afghanistan Cam-paign Medal, the Iraq Campaign Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, Noncommissioned Officer Professional Devel-opment Ribbon with numeral three, Army Service Ribbon, Special Forces Tab, Combat Infantryman Badge and Parachutist Badge. Born in the small town of Coldspring, Texas, on March 11, 1979, Calvin had a big heart from a young age. He was always looking out for other people, trying to do what was right to the best of his ability. The son of Jack Wash-ington and Betty Harrison, he was the 4th of 6 kids. His siblings are Demetric, Diane, Debra, Stephanie, and Zacchaeus. He was also a relentlessly hard-worker. When he was a child, he helped his grand-father do yard work around town. His grand-father even taught him to drive. He was close to his family and loved them very much. One day, when Calvin was working at Country Gro-ceries, a customer walked in, looked him right in the eye and said ‘‘You’re never gonna be nothin.’’ Calvin would remember that moment the rest of his life, even recalling to his dad the last time he was home. In high school, Calvin turned his work ethic toward sports. He was an all-around athlete, playing basketball, football, and tennis. When he graduated in 1998, he followed in his grandfather’s footsteps and signed up for the Army. He loved being a soldier, said his fa-ther, Jack Washington. He was a true patriot who wanted to serve his country. In 2007, Sgt. Harrison became a Green Beret. His 7th Special Forces Group was very close. They had all gone through the same rigorous training and knew that when their lives depended on it, they could trust each other. Each team member had a role. For Sgt. Harrison, this was Medical Sergeant. Special Forces Medical Sergeants are considered to be the finest first-response medical techni-cians in the world. When his fellow soldier went down, it was Sgt. Harrison that jumped to his rescue. His comrades knew at a very practical level that their lives were in his hands. The Green Beret motto is ‘‘De oppresso liber’’ which means to liberate the oppressed. That is exactly what Sgt. Harrison was doing as a part of the Company A, 2nd Battalion, 7th Special Forces Group (Airborne) in Afghani-stan. Sgt. Harrison couldn’t talk too much about his top secret job, but he didn’t mind. He was never one to talk about himself too much. He just did it. It wasn’t special to him. He just did the best he could with everything he tried. It was his second tour and mission that Sgt. Harrison would give his life for. He was killed by small arms fire on September 29, 2010 in Uruzgan province in Afghanistan. ‘‘He died what he loved doing.’’ said his fa-ther. ‘‘I’m very proud of him, and I told him that all the time.’’ Sgt. Harrison left behind two precious daughters, Azalia and Eleanna. David Lloyd George, a former British Prime Minister, once said, ‘‘The stern hand of fate has scourged us to an elevation where we can see the great everlasting things that matter for a nation; the great peaks of honor we had for-gotten—duty and patriotism, clad in glittering white; the great pinnacle of sacrifice pointing like a rugged finger to heaven.’’ Sgt. Harrison climbed up both of those peaks—honor and duty—and now we can look up to heaven with gratitude and thanks for his eternal reminder that freedom is not free. Texas is proud to have called him a soldier, a son, and a hero. And that’s just the way it is.

HONORING THE SERVICE AND LEG-ACY OF THE HONORABLE ARLAN MEEKHOF 
HON. BILL HUIZENGA 
OF MICHIGAN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 16, 2018 Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. Arlan Meekhof and his admi-rable career in public service to the West Michigan Community. A lifelong resident of West Michigan, Arlan has earned the admiration of his colleagues and the respect of Ottawa County residents by consistently acting with decency and integrity. An accomplished legislator, Senator Meekhof has cemented a legacy of public service and servant leadership throughout the state of Michigan. First elected to the Olive Township Board of Trustees in 1996, Senator Meekhof has con-tinued to serve the people of West Michigan for over two decades. In 2007, he began his first term in the Michigan House of Represent-atives and was elected assistant leader by his colleagues in January 2009. In November of 2010 he was elected to the State Senate in the 30th State Senate District, representing Ottawa County and the City of Grandville and Sparta Township in Kent County. Following his 2014 reelection to the State Senate, he was unanimously elected to be Senate Majority leader—displaying the respect Senator Meekhof has cultivated during his career. In his eight years serving in the Michigan Senate, he has been a commendable leader that ensured on-time and balanced budgets. His leadership contributed and played a key role to the elimination of a billion dollar state deficit. During his time in both the House and Senate, he promoted efficient and effective government reforms that played a significant role in transforming Michigan into a destination for families, businesses and the next genera-tion of leaders. Today, October 16, 2018, we honor and recognize Senator Arlan Meekhof for his two- decades long career. The efforts and success of Senator Arlan Meekhof in service to his community should be celebrated. I thank him for a lifetime of hard work and service. f

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 16, 2018 Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan, on the occasion of its 150th—or sesquicentennial—celebration. Located in the heart of Detroit, Wayne State University is ranked among our nation’s best research insti-tutions, educates over 27,000 students among 13 schools and colleges, and is the eighth- largest employer in the city of Detroit. In addition to educating and training leaders in research, the arts, law, and medicine, Wayne State University has for over 150 years, consistently served the people of De-troit, the great state of Michigan and our na-tion.

Jenks, to the current president Dr. M. Roy Wil-son, Wayne State University is the embodi-ment of public service and access to edu-cation. Under the direction of Dr. Wilson, Wayne State University has dramatically in-creased its overall six-year graduation rate, with African American graduation rates double what they were just a few years ago. Today, Wayne State University attracts, and is com-posed of, many of the best and brightest stu-dents and researchers, with an excellent team of administration, faculty, and staff profes-sionals. They remain firmly rooted in the com-munity while preparing their diverse student body to impact locally and globally making the university a thriving hub of innovation and aca-demia. Wayne State University has also cemented its status as a leading research institution and a champion for women and children in our na-tion. In fact, Wayne State University is the only site outside of Bethesda, Maryland, that houses a branch of the National Institutes of Health. Thanks to the Perinatology Research Branch, over 20,000 women, children, and families have received access to world-class prenatal health care that they might not have otherwise been able to access. Through the Integrative Biosciences Center (IBio), the University is reimagining the way science approaches urban health issues. IBio was named the 2017 Renovated Laboratory of the Year by R&D Magazine and Laboratory Design. This 127,000–square-foot, $90 million facility is dedicated to studying and eliminating the many health disparities that plague resi-dents of Detroit and communities across the country. IBio includes faculty with expertise in environmental sciences, bio and systems engi-neering, heart disease, diabetes, obesity, asth-ma, and bio-behavioral health. Opened this fall, the Mike Ilitch School of Business, further expands the Wayne State campus into The District Detroit while adding academic pro-grams in the business of sports and entertain-ment. The mission of Wayne State University is to create and advance knowledge, prepare a di-verse student body to thrive, and positively im-pact local and global communities. I congratu-late and thank Wayne State University’s stu-dent body, Board of Governors, President M. Roy Wilson, faculty and administrators for liv-ing out the passion and principle of their mis-sion statement. Reaching their 150th anniver-sary is a milestone, and I eagerly look forward to what the University accomplishes in its next 150 years. Wayne State University has been, is and will always be Warrior Strong.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 16, 2018 Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I proudly pause to recognize Brad Byler. Brad is a very special young man who has exempli-fied the finest qualities of citizenship and lead-ership by taking an active part in the Boy Scouts of America, Troop 1692, and earning the most prestigious award of Eagle Scout. Brad has been very active with his troop, participating in many scout activities.

Most notably, Brad has contributed to his community through his Eagle Scout project. Mr. Speaker, I proudly ask you to join me in commending Brad for his accomplishments with the Boy Scouts of America and for his ef-forts put forth in achieving the highest distinc-tion of Eagle Scout. f 
HONORING THE 20TH ANNIVER-SARY OF THE SACRAMENTO GROUNDWATER AUTHORITY 
HON. AMI BERA 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 16, 2018 Mr. BERA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to rec-ognize the Sacramento Groundwater Authority on celebrating their 20th anniversary and their continued commitment to managing water re-sources in the Sacramento region. The Sacramento Groundwater Authority (SGA) was formed in 1998 to manage the groundwater basin located north of the Amer-ican River and is made up of the major water agencies and water users in the region. One of the first groundwater management agencies of its kind, SGA’s work has been instrumental to implementing the Water Forum Agreement of 2000 which aims to provide a reliable and safe water supply for Sacramento through 2030. SGA is committed to balancing the use of groundwater and surface water to meet re-gional needs, while reducing water diversions from the American River to protect the natural resources of the Sacramento community dur-ing times of dry water years. Over the last 20 years, SGA has coordi-nated with other authorities in the region to protect groundwater quality. Their achieve-ments include developing and implementing a Groundwater Management Plan, and creating the Water Accounting Framework, which de-veloped conjunctive use and groundwater banking programs that enhance the sustain-ability of the basin. I extend my sincere congratulations to the Sacramento Groundwater Authority for the great service it provides to Sacramento Coun-ty and the State of California as they celebrate 20 years of operation. I wish them well in their continued efforts to provide quality water re-source management for our region.

HON. BRIAN K. FITZPATRICK 
OF PENNSYLVANIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 16, 2018 Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an educator in Bucks County, Pennsylvania who recently became a finalist in a national education grant contest. James Maloney, a teacher at Neshaminy High School in Langhorne, becomes one step closer to the $100,000 education grant that is sponsored to fund meaningful projects in local schools and communities. If selected, James plans on creating a ‘‘living classroom’’ that en-ables students to grow plants and cultivate produce. This is particularly beneficial for food pantries, which will benefit from the vegetables grown. It will also serve as a hands-on learn-ing experience for students with special needs to gain valuable life skills. I applaud James for his dedication to his students and our community. I wish him all the best in his quest for this important grant. f 
HONORING SALINA EDWARDS WITH CALIFORNIA’S THIRD DIS-TRICT WOMAN OF THE YEAR AWARD 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 16, 2018 Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Salina Edwards as a woman of the year. She is an unflinchingly energetic and op-timistic advocate for her community. A reliable source of determination and persistence, Ms. Edwards has always made it a priority to bet-ter the lives of those around her by asking the tough questions and delving into the minutia of an issue before determining the best possible course for the citizens she serves. After a dis-tinguished fourteen-year career with the Glenn County Superior Court, she still had a desire to serve and decided to run for office. In addi-tion to her role as Councilwoman, her wide range of duties and responsibilities for the city include the Waste Management Board, the Glenn County Local Agency Formation Com-mission, the Orland Library Commission, the Glenn County Transportation Committee, and the Glenn County Regional Transportation Committee. Ms. Edwards is a caring and mindful public servant devoted to every aspect of her community, when she isn’t focused on fulfilling her duties as a Councilwoman, she can be found pitching in for the Orland Bee City Committee and the Orland Queen Bee City of North America. Her unfailing enthu-siasm and dedicated spirit make her a highly visible presence in the community, whether volunteering for local Kiwanis club events or pitching in at the Orland Food Pantry. Ms. Edwards is devoted community servant whose positive impact cannot be overstated.

RECHECK IS PRECHECK ACT OF  2018 As passed by the House of Representatives on September 4, 2018 The federal government—primarily through the Transportation Security Admin-istration (TSA)—administers several risk- based programs that facilitate, through ad-vanced vetting of applicants, expedited screening of participating passengers at se-curity checkpoints. H.R. 6265 would require TSA to ensure that only travelers who are members of such programs are permitted to use expedited security-screening lanes (often called PreCheck lanes) at TSA-regulated air-ports. The act would require the agency to increase enrollment in such programs and to conduct a pilot program related to the use of modified screening procedures for passengers deemed to pose low security risks. The legis-lation also would specify other administra-tive and reporting requirements. Using information from TSA, CBO esti-mates that implementing H.R. 6265 would not significantly affect the federal budget. The agency is already implementing activi-ties that are similar to those envisioned under H.R. 6265. As a result, CBO expects that any change in the agency’s spending— which would be subject to appropriation— would be insignificant. Enacting H.R. 6265 would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you- go procedures do not apply. CBO estimates that enacting H.R. 6265 would not increase net direct spending or on- budget deficits in any of the four consecutive 10-year periods beginning in 2029. H.R. 6265 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act. The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Megan Carroll. The estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy Assistant Director for Budget Analysis. HONORING JAMES J. TEDESCO, III 
HON. BILL PASCRELL, JR. 
OF NEW JERSEY  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 16, 2018 Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I would like to call to your attention the many outstanding achievements of Mr. James J. Tedesco, III. With this Extension of Remarks, I recognize the many contributions he has made to the people of the Ninth Congressional District. Expressing the influence of James J. Tedesco, III on our community is an honor. As a fellow official, and an admirer, it gives me great pleasure to add my personal apprecia-tion and commendation. James was born on February 5, 1953 in Paramus, New Jersey. Following an example set by his father, James would dedicate his life to public service. In 1976, he would join the Paramus Fire Department, where he was a volunteer firefighter and twice elected Fire Chief. In 2000, James would begin his political career presiding over a successful bid for the Paramus Borough Council. This political as-cendancy would ultimately result in his subse-quent election to the position of Mayor, a posi-tion he would hold for two terms, before being elected the Bergen County Executive. From the day James was sworn in as Ber-gen County Executive in 2015, he has com-mitted to improving the nearly ten-thousand acres within the Bergen County Parks System and expanding services to veterans and their families. Under Mr. Tedesco’s leadership, Ber-gen County has been recognized by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Develop-ment as the best in the state to combat home-lessness amongst veterans. I am very proud to hear of such remarkable leadership for those that sacrifice the most for our country. Bergen County Executive James J. Tedesco, III has been equally instrumental in advancing a number of other incredibly impor-tant initiatives. In 2015, Mr. Tedesco restored critical funding to Bergen County Community College and stands as a longtime advocate. Additionally, James is a strong proponent of the Stigma Free Initiative, which seeks to eliminate the stigma associated with mental ill-ness and encourage mental health treatment. The job of a United States Congressman in-volves much that is rewarding, yet nothing compares to working with and recognizing the efforts of dedicated individuals like Bergen County Executive, James J. Tedesco, III. I am proud to call James a friend. Mr. Speaker, I ask that you join our col-leagues, family, friends and the residents of Bergen County in recognizing Bergen County Executive James J. Tedesco’s outstanding character and service to his community.

50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE PRO-TEST BY TOMMIE SMITH, JOHN CARLOS, AND PETER NORMAN AT THE 1968 OLYMPIC GAMES IN MEXICO CITY 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 16, 2018 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to commemorate the 50th Anniversary of the si-lent protest of Tommie Smith, John Carlos, and Peter Norman at the 1968 Summer Olym-pic Games in Mexico City. Mr. Speaker, we know that if it were not for the active protest of patriots, the United States of America would not exist. It was brave men throwing tea overboard into Boston Harbor, and protesting that tax-ation without representation is tyranny. The right of the people to peacefully assem-ble and petition their government for a redress of grievances, or protest, is guaranteed by the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The 1968 Summer Olympics came on heels of much tragedy and social upheaval in the United States. The American people were reeling from the assassinations of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Sen. Robert F. Kennedy and there was growing discontent and opposition to the Viet-nam War. In the lead-up to the Olympics, Tommie Smith and John Carlos helped organize the Olympic Project for Human Rights (OPHR), a group that reflected Black pride and social consciousness. The group saw the Olympic Games as an opportunity to agitate for better treatment of black athletes and black people around the world. Its demands included hiring more black coaches and rescinding Olympic invitations to Rhodesia and South Africa, both of which practiced apartheid. Although the OPHR initially proposed a boy-cott of the Olympics altogether, Tommie Smith and John Carlos decided to compete in the hopes they could use their achievements as a platform for broader change. Ten days before the opening of the Summer Games, an unarmed group of protesters as-sembled in Mexico City’s Three Cultures Square to plan the next move of the growing Mexican students’ movement. The Mexican government sent in bulldozers to disperse the thousands gathered, and troops fired into the crowd, slaughtering be-tween four (the government’s official count) and 3,000 students. John Carlos and Tommie Smith finished first and third in the 200-meter dash final with times of 19.83 seconds and 20.10 seconds re-spectively, which at the time was a world record. Many people remember these names from their protest with raised, black-gloved fists to represent their solidarity and support with black people and oppressed people around the world. On the victory platform to receive their Gold and Bronze Medals, Tommie Smith and John Carlos also displayed other symbols of protest and strength: black-socked feet without shoes to bring attention to black poverty and beads to protest lynching. Although, the images of Tommie Smith and John Carlos have been engrained into the hearts and minds of generations we cannot ig-nore the third person that stood on the po-dium. Australian Peter Norman, the Silver Med-alist, did not raise a fist covered by a black glove, but he too supported the protest in his own fashion. Peter Norman was a working-class boy from Melbourne, Australia, raised in a family who were devout members of the Salvation Army, an evangelical group connected with the chari-table group better known to Americans, who shared the belief that all men were equal.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD —Extensions of RemarksE1415 October 16, 2018 
The Australian also asked how he could support his fellow medalists, and they sug-gested he wear a badge for the Olympic Project for Human Rights. Peter Norman did not raise his fist, but by wearing the badge, he made his stance clear. After the protest, Tommie Smith and John Carlos were rushed from the stadium, sus-pended by the U.S. team, and kicked out of the Olympic Village for turning their medal ceremony into a political statement. They went home to the United States, only to face serious backlash, including death threats. However, Tommie Smith and John Carlos were both gradually re-accepted into the Olympic fold and went on to careers in profes-sional football before retiring. Peter Norman, meanwhile, was punished severely by the Australian sports establish-ment. Though he qualified for the Olympic team repeatedly, posting the fastest times by far in Australia, he was snubbed by the team in 1972. Rather than allow Peter Norman to com-pete, the Australians did not send a sprinter at all. Peter Norman immediately retired from the sport and began to suffer from depression, al-coholism and a painkiller addiction. However, even though it cost him his career and much of his happiness, Peter Norman would have done it over again. Civil rights and more importantly human rights transcend party, state, and national boundaries. To quote the late Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. ‘‘Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice ev-erywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, af-fects all indirectly.’’ Today again, we see individuals being os-tracized and denigrated for speaking out against injustice. Colin Kaepernick’s career as a quarterback in the National Football League has suffered because of his courageous decision to peace-fully protest the killing of unarmed black men by police officers in the form of taking a knee during the national anthem. NFL players enjoy the same rights guaran-teed under the Constitution as every other American, including the right to petition their government for redress of grievances. Mr. Speaker, as we commemorate this his-toric day in history, we must continue to sup-port our citizens who stand against injustices within our borders. I support the principles that Tommie Smith, Peter Norman, and John Carlos stood for 50 years ago.

HON. JOHN GARAMENDI

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 16, 2018 Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Vera Correa as a woman of the year. She is a dedicated advocate and volunteer who gives her time generously in service to her community. As the Vice President of the Alliance for Hispanic Advancement she works to further the organization’s goal of improving the quality of life for people of Hispanic herit-age. Through community involvement, edu-cational enhancement, and economic pro-motion, she and the AHA have worked to rep-resent and serve the Hispanic community. She also gives her time organizing numerous com-munity events such as the Kiwanis Italian Night, Hogs & Hula, the Cinco de Mayo Pa-rade and Festival, the Mexican Independence Day Festival, the Day of the Dead event, and the Binational Health Week Fair. Whether it is through her work as Vice President of the Alli-ance for Hispanic Advancement, or in her many volunteer roles in her community, Ms. Correa has demonstrated a true commitment to improving the lives of others. She is a com-munity leader and activist who never stops working for those in need of a helping hand. Her dedication to her community provides in-spiration for others to follow in her footsteps as leaders and volunteers. Ms. Correa is gen-erous, passionate, dedicated, and her con-tribution to her community is truly worthy of recognition.

IN RECOGNITION OF SANGER MASONIC LODGE 
HON. DAVID G. VALADAO 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 16, 2018 Mr. VALADAO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Sanger Masonic Lodge for one-hun-dred and twenty-five years of service in their community. Sanger Masonic Lodge was established soon after the founding of the City of Sanger in California. Supported by the expansion of the nation’s railroad system, Sanger quickly transformed into a thriving community and at-tracted a wide variety of industries and individ-uals. As the city grew, so did the need for so-cial functions. Many of Sanger’s male citizens were members of Masonic lodges in other parts of country and quickly realized there were enough Masons in the city to consider forming their own lodge. Their charter was issued on October 11, 1893, officially author-izing the group to become Sanger Masonic Lodge, No. 316 under the Grand Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons of California. While they met in various locations in the early years, Sanger Masonic Lodge found its per-manent home in 1932 in the city’s historic Downtown. They have remained a vital part of Sanger’s success ever since. Seventy-one active members strong, Sanger Masonic Lodge supports numerous commu-nity-service initiatives. They have donated tens of thousands of dollars to organizations includ-ing Sanger High School, the Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps, and various non-prof-its. Sanger Masonic Lodge also invests their time in homeless outreach efforts and pro-vides yard services to senior citizens free of charge. Sanger Masonic Lodge has addition-ally demonstrated a commitment to our active- duty service members. They have cooked meals for units departing for combat zones and financially supported military Christmas parties. Sanger Masonic Lodge is also known for their Child ID programs throughout the County of Fresno. These programs allow parents the opportunity to create a kit of identifying mate-rials for their child, free of charge. The kit con-tains items including a fingerprint card, phys-ical description, and DNA sample to provide critical information for law enforcement if a child goes missing. Fifteen years since their creation, Child ID programs have been used by over fifteen-thousand families. After more than a century in existence, San-ger Masonic Lodge has become a foundational institution for the City of Sanger. Their passion for their community is dem-onstrated through the countless hours of serv-ice and fundraising they have freely given. While the city and nation have drastically changed since 1893, Sanger Masonic Lodge has remained a consistent endorser for the community. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the United States House of Representatives to join me in commending Sanger Masonic Lodge for one-hundred and twenty-five years of service and wishing them further success in their future. f

HON. DAVID YOUNG 
OF IOWA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 16, 2018 Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor Jannes and Neil Aupperle of Anita, Iowa on the very special occasion of their 65th wedding anniversary.

HONORING JOHN CATSIMATIDIS 
HON. GUS M. BILIRAKIS 
OF FLORIDA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 16, 2018 Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the extraordinary contributions of John Catsimatidis to our nation. John’s story show-cases the very best of what immigrants can accomplish in our great nation through hard work, ingenuity, and perseverance. John was born on the Greek island of Nisyros and came to this country when he was just a few months old. He grew up in East Harlem, and attended New York University to pursue a degree in electrical engineering. Be-ginning with partial ownership of a friend’s su-permarket, he grew his business into a proud pillar of American industry. In addition to Gristedes supermarket, John Catsimatidis’s Red Apple Group is primarily an energy com-pany with holdings in oil refining, real estate, aviation, and medical and industrial tech-nology. His businesses, which post annual sales of approximately $5 billion, employ more than 8,000 people. John’s business success came directly from the integration of his own ingenuity with American opportunity, and adds to a long legacy of immigrants who have pushed our nation to greater heights. John and his family have also been excep-tional in their commitment to philanthropy. The Catsimatidis Foundation has been instru-mental in supporting numerous worthy causes including the Police Athletic League, the Par-kinson’s Disease Foundation, the Hellenic Times Scholarship Fund, AHEPA and count-less others. His family’s generosity will ensure that many thousands will find relief from their suffering and future generations will have ac-cess to resources that will allow them to pur-sue their dreams. As a benefactor of John’s philanthropy, the Order of AHEPA, has promoted the ancient Hellenic ideals of education, philanthropy, civic responsibility, family and individual excellence through community service and volunteerism. AHEPA was instrumental in welcoming the early Greek immigrants as they disembarked at Ellis Island, and eased their assimilation into the American culture by teaching English and finding employment opportunities for these new arrivals. The Delphi Chapter No. 25 of AHEPA was founded in Manhattan, New York. It has had many notable and prominent members in its history, including many Phil-Hellenes who em-braced AHEPA’s ideals and values. On March 11, 1931 the then New York State Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt became a member of the Order of AHEPA and joined the Delphi Chapter No. 25 in New York City. The Delphi 25 Chapter continues on today the tradition of AHEPA’s ideals and values of promoting edu-cation and Hellenism through many efforts of public service and philanthropy. I join the AHEPA in honoring John Catsimatidis for his numerous achievements and philanthropic efforts in service to the Greek-American community and humanity at large. I thank him for his outstanding service to our country. Worthy. Worthy. Worthy. (Axios. Axios. Axios.) f 
HONORING TEJINDER KAUR WITH CALIFORNIA’S THIRD DISTRICT WOMAN OF THE YEAR AWARD 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 16, 2018 Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Tejinder Kaur as a woman of the year. She has dedicated her career to pro-moting literacy in her community. Through her work at the Sutter County Library Literacy Services Department she has helped a large immigrant population learn to speak, read, and write in English. Most impressively, Ms. Kaur played a pivotal role in building Sutter County Library’s Literacy Services Citizenship Prepa-ration class which has helped students pur-suing United States Citizenship. The program has assisted students in the completion of 6,386 applications for Naturalization, 740 ap-plications for Certificates of Citizenship, and 4,000 fee waiver requests. Thanks to Ms. Kaur’s work, her students had a guide through the overwhelming process of applying for citi-zenship and were able to achieve a smooth transition into American culture. Her service to her community goes above and beyond the requirements of her profession. For the past 14 years she has organized the Multicultural Women’s Dance which draws women from all different cultures in the Yuba-Sutter area. She coordinated with the Sutter County Public Health Department to ensure the event would be a healthy learning experience as well as a valuable cultural exchange. Her work has played an important role in bringing her com-munity together to build relationships across cultural barriers. Ms. Kaur’s devotion to her work and dedication to her community has had an immense positive impact throughout Sutter County. f 
CONGRATULATING CARLOS LAATE 
HON. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM 
OF NEW MEXICO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 16, 2018 Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratu-late Carlos Laate of Zuni Pueblo in New Mex-ico for his role in the Pueblo Pottery Mug project and his success as a Native artist. The Pueblo Pottery Mug project started as a collaboration between five Pueblo artists and the first Pueblo-owned Starbucks in New Mex-ico. The mugs were first sold in 2016 at the Starbucks store in Albuquerque. Each mug was hand-crafted by a different Pueblo artist to celebrate the opening of the new store and to symbolize the collaboration between New Mexico Pueblos and Starbucks. After quickly selling out of the unique mugs—selling over 6,000 mugs—the Shumakolowa gift shop col-laborated with the artists to sell mugs at their location in the Indian Pueblo Cultural Center. Mr. Laate hails from a long line of artists in the Pueblo of Zuni. Motivated by his mother and grandmother, who were renowned potters, he has been making pottery for more than thir-ty years. Mr. Laate’s work finds inspiration in the an-cient potsherds near his home. It was his grandparents who helped him discover mean-ing in the images and designs on these an-cient works of art, and he strives to incor-porate the metaphors, blessings, and prayers from them into his own pieces of pottery. Mr. Speaker, I applaud Carlos Laate for being a part of the Pueblo Pottery Mug project. This project has given the community, as well as visitors to New Mexico, an oppor-tunity to appreciate usable pieces of art that are inspired by Native culture and traditions. I look forward to seeing this project continue to flourish and support talented Native artists from Pueblos throughout New Mexico.

HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 16, 2018 Mr. CLEAVER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the United Way of Greater Kan-sas City, a leader and innovator of public health and wellness in the Greater Kansas City community, for their one hundred years of service.

nonprofit agencies. Focused on providing war relief and support for the military during World War I, the United Way of Greater Kansas City began in 1918 as a nonprofit in Missouri’s Fifth Congressional District. One hundred years later, it is now one of the largest organi-zations in Kansas City. It has a service area spanning five locations, and all are dedicated to providing services that benefit disadvan-taged families and individuals throughout the Kansas City area. For one hundred years, United Way of Greater Kansas City has demonstrated a de-sire to help individuals by uniting companies, local business owners, and neighborhood leaders to address the needs of a continu-ously growing population. Currently, United Way is focused on raising funds for programs and organizations driven to help individuals and families in need. The funds raised by United Way ensure that local agencies and or-ganizations can help individuals meet their full potential academically, socially, and financially by participating in training and classes de-signed to help them acquire new skills and support networks. Community projects funded by the organization helped introduce literacy programs such as the Dolly Parton Imagina-tion Library, which sends books to children of all ages at no cost. Other partnerships and contributions by United Way include Project Rise, which offers paid internships to young students, free tax services with H&R Block, and support for HIV/AIDS agencies. In 1926, United Way of Greater Kansas City raised over one million dollars in donations for the first time in the organization’s history. Since then, they have continued to host dona-tion and volunteer campaigns to raise addi-tional funds for an array of causes. These funds are distributed to support organizations and agencies providing aid to the people of Kansas City in times of hardship. Primary ex-amples include assisting local agencies during the Great Depression and after the dev-astating ‘‘Plaza Flood’’ of 1977. Moreover, the organization is now focused on improving human capital and cultivating economic inno-vation through education and enrichment pro-grams. United Way of Greater Kansas City has established themselves as a pillar in our community. It is my steadfast belief that the philanthropy of this organization has benefitted my constitu-ents tremendously. Their noteworthy contribu-tions to the city reveal an organization found-ed on empathy. United Way of Greater Kan-sas City guides individuals to the right person, program, or place when assistance is re-quired. The people of Kansas City, myself in-cluded, are grateful to have such a dedicated organization in our neighborhood, focused on addressing community needs. Mr. Speaker, please join me and all of Mis-souri’s Fifth Congressional District in honoring United Way of Greater Kansas City for their monumental achievement of 100 years of service in the community and their indelible mark on society. I urge all my colleagues and fellow citizens across the country to join me in showing our appreciation to United Way of Greater Kansas City for their dedication to hu-manitarian service. CELEBRATING THE LIFE AND SERVICE OF MICKEY KAITANGIAN 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 16, 2018 Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to the life of Mickey Kaitangian, who passed from this life on Au-gust 28, 2018 at the age of 83. Mickey was a beloved fixture of the Fresno community, known for volunteering his time and serving others. From his service to our country to his 29 years as a firefighter, Mickey’s generous spirit touched the lives of everyone who had the pleasure of knowing him. Born May 27, 1935 in Fresno, California, Mickey Kaitangian and his brother grew up in poverty-stricken Southeast Fresno. Young Mickey would wander to Fire Station 4 down the street from his home and befriend the fire-men on their breaks, where he kindled his deep love for firefighting. Before beginning his firefighting career, Mickey enlisted in the United States Navy. He worked as a mechanic for the Douglas A–1 Skyraider, serving on the USS Ranger (CV– 61) aircraft carrier during the WestPac Far East Cruise. In 1964, at the age of 29, Mickey joined the Fresno Fire Department. For 29 years, Mickey served on the frontlines. His colleagues re-member Mickey as, ‘‘the first to go into the fire and the last to come out.’’ Even after long hours of hard work, Mickey always made time for his wife Betty, and their sons Kelly and Raymond. Mickey lived life to the fullest. He volun-teered for pit crews of famous race car driv-ers, including Mario Andretti and A. J. Foyt in 1969. He also tried his hand at Semi-Pro baseball. After his retirement in 1994, Mickey contin-ued to serve as an ambassador for the Fresno Fire Department by representing them at local charity events. He so generously gave his time to a number of local charities, including donating toys to patients at the local children’s hospital and teaching school children about fire safety. Mickey’s life of dedicated service for the community and country he loved so much should serve as an example to us all. He is survived by his beloved wife Betty, sons Kelly and Raymond, and six grandchildren. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me on this day in a moment of silence in memory of the life and service of Mickey Kaitangian. The contributions that he gave throughout his life will continue to have a lasting impression on the fabric of our Valley. His presence in our community will be greatly missed. It is my honor to join his family and many friends in celebrating his life.

HONORING SUE HEITMAN WITH CALIFORNIA’S THIRD DISTRICT WOMAN OF THE YEAR AWARD 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 16, 2018 Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Sue Heitman as a woman of the year. She has been a dedicated volunteer for over 20 years. Her commitment to serving her community is evident by her participation on a multitude of non-profit boards of directors. She has continuously dedicated her time to lifting up communities and improving the lives of oth-ers. In her 19 years at Yolo First 5, she helped grant over 30 million dollars to worthy causes benefitting children under 5 in Yolo County. She helped found and has spent 18 years working with Capay Valley Vision, an or-ganization dedicated to preserving the herit-age and community of Capay Valley as the re-gion grows and changes in pursuit of a better future. For 10 years she has served as a board member of the New Seasons Commu-nity Development Corporation helping to revi-talize downtown Esparto through community development projects. Ms. Heitman has ex-celled in all of her volunteer roles, earning awards from the Yolo Community Foundation, Sacramento Area Council of Governments, and Sacramento Positive Options Family Serv-ices. She has also been generous with her time in a way that few people are by serving as a foster parent for special needs children for over 10 years. She has fostered 27 special needs children and continues to do so to this day. The impact of Ms. Heitman’s volunteer work can be seen throughout her community, and the personal impact she has had on the lives of her foster children will last for years to come. f

With approximately 100 years of volunteering for our school district, the Peters are more than deserving of this award.’’ Mr. Speaker, I applaud and congratulate Carol and Terry Peters for receiving the 2018 Volunteers of the Year Award given by the AHSTW Community School District. Carol and Terry are shining examples of how hard work and dedication can affect the future of stu-dents and their educational goals. I am proud to represent them in the United States Con-gress.

HON. SAM GRAVES 
OF MISSOURI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 16, 2018 Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I proudly pause to recognize Jackson Fry. Jack-son is a very special young man who has ex-emplified the finest qualities of citizenship and leadership by taking an active part in the Boy Scouts of America, Troop 1264, and earning the most prestigious award of Eagle Scout. Jackson has been very active with his troop, participating in many scout activities. Over the many years Jackson has been involved with scouting, he has not only earned numerous merit badges, but also the respect of his fam-ily, peers, and community. Most notably, Jack-son has become a Firebuilder in the tribe Mic- O-Say. Jackson has also contributed to his community through his Eagle Scout project. Jackson stenciled over 125 storm drains for the City of Lee’s Summit to reduce flooding and pollution in their local lakes and streams.

IN MEMORY OF STEVEN ALLEN CHIPMAN 
HON. JOE COURTNEY 
OF CONNECTICUT  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 16, 2018 Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of Steven Chipman of Ellington, CT. Steven died this past March and we in Eastern Connecticut are at a loss. He was a patriot, protector, and family man. Steven Allen Chipman was born and raised in Rockville, CT. A graduate of Rockville High School and Manchester Community College, Steven joined the Connecticut National Guard in 1986 and served until 1992. He also en-joyed a 23-year career with the Vernon Police Department, before opening his own firm, In-novative Investigators, LLC. Although Steven wore many hats in his short life, I think ‘‘protector’’ would be the most fitting descriptor for this man who gave so much. He was a defender of his hometown and country and a loving father. He also had a gentle way with all people. His childhood friends describe him as the sort of person who looks out for the little guy. Steven was also in-credibly patient—a quality he instilled in his children, Hunter and Jake, who very much consider their father a superhero. Steven was a beloved member of his com-munity, and he will be missed greatly by all of those who benefited from his loyalty and serv-ice, especially the residents of our hometown of Vernon. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to please join me in honoring Steven Chipman and expressing our deepest sympathies for his family and friends, and the eastern Con-necticut region who lost a valued public serv-ant.

Ms. Chavarria comes from a long line of art-ists and potters. Inspired by her family’s tech-nique, she strives to continue making pottery according to ancient methods. Using clay from the hills where she lives, she delicately carves and paints her pieces. Ms. Chavarria utilizes traditional hand- coiling methods to craft her pottery. She uses an open fire for red pots and other Pueblo methods of production to make black-on-black designs, depending on the finish she desires. Mr. Speaker, I applaud Denise Chavarria for being a part of the Pueblo Pottery Mug project. This project has given the community, as well as visitors to New Mexico, an oppor-tunity to appreciate usable pieces of art that are inspired by Native culture and traditions. I look forward to seeing this project continue to flourish and support talented Native artists from Pueblos throughout New Mexico.

Mr. Eick also holds a Master’s Degree in Edu-cational Technology from Touro University. Mr. Eick has been a mathematics teacher at American Canyon High School for the last nine years. Each day he strives to have every student in his classes understand the math he is teaching. He begins each day recognizing that students ‘‘don’t care how much you know until they know how much you care.’’ Mr. Eick tries to show his students how much he cares about their understanding of math and their well-being, frequently acting as a mentor, advi-sor and role model. He strives to show his stu-dents how to have strong character and live generously. Mr. Eick is also the founder and advisor for Mu Alpha Theta, mentor and trainer for New Teacher Induction, advisor for Gay-Straight Al-liance, assistant coach for the Robotics Club, leader in Math 2 Professional Learning Com-munity and a site team member for Advance-ment Via Individual Determination (AVID).

HONORING MAYOR GEORGE PRADEL 
HON. PETER J. ROSKAM 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 16, 2018 Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the late A. George Pradel, who dedi-cated his life to the betterment of his home-town, Naperville, Illinois, most notably as mayor for two decades. A lifelong Napervillian, Mr. Pradel began his life in public service by joining the military where he completed a three-year tour with the United States Marine Corps. After his time in the Marine Corps, he went on to serve as a police officer in his hometown. As an officer in Naperville he took it upon himself to educate students about the role of police in the com-munity. He took a unique approach in doing so by helping develop ‘‘Safety Town,’’ a minia-ture town on Aurora Ave. that teaches children about self-awareness, and staying safe in the community. His cheerful demeanor and eager-ness to work with kids earned him the nick-name ‘‘Officer Friendly.’’ As Officer Friendly continued to grow as an icon in Naperville, the community turned to him once again when it needed a leader, and in 1995 George Pradel was elected Mayor. As Mayor of Naperville, Mr. Pradel continued along the path that led him to office. He spoke at schools and events, he cut ribbons, and he was seen throughout the community, always with a smile. Under Mayor Pradel’s leadership Naperville transformed from a growing suburban town to an award-winning city. He helped Naperville attract businesses from around the world, he encouraged the continued excellence in Naperville schools, and he always supported local law enforcement efforts to keep his hometown safe. Mr. Speaker, Naperville lost a great Amer-ican in Mayor Pradel. I offer my greatest con-dolences to the Pradel family, and thank A. George Pradel for his lifetime of dedication to the city of Naperville and to our country. HONORING THE 150TH ANNIVER-SARY OF CHAPEL GROVE UNITED CHURCH OF CHRIST IN WINDSOR, VIRGINIA HON. ROBERT C. ‘‘BOBBY’’ SCOTT 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 16, 2018 Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 150th anniversary of Chap-el Grove United Church of Christ in Windsor, Virginia. In 1868, founding members of Chapel Grove United Church of Christ left Antioch, the Baptist church of their former slave owners where they had been forced to worship in the balcony. Led by their ‘‘Spiritual Leader,’’ Isom Lawrence, the congregation began meeting under a bush arbor once a month for service. The origins of the church starting under a bush arbor is significant. For centuries, African slaves traditionally gathered in these sites for religious services. Worshippers of Chapel Grove traveled from near and far, and the journey was often a full day affair. In 1899, Reverend Jetson Copeland and the congregation purchased property alongside present day Blackwater Road. After 17 years of construction, the church finally opened its doors in 1916. Even after several series of re-modeling and expansion, the original sanc-tuary remains part of the church’s foundation and reminds us of years of fellowship and service. Originally called Chapel Grove Christian Church, this historic church has been renamed several times through the years. After merging with the Congregational Church, it was named Chapel Grove Congregational Christian Church. In 1957, after merging with the United Church of Christ, it procured its current name of Chapel Grove United Church of Christ. Today, the church is part of the Eastern Vir-ginia District of the Southern Conference of the United Church of Christ. This association represents 35 local black churches and 45 local white churches and continues to teach the word of God around the nation. While Chapel Grove is primarily a place of worship, the church provides civic, health, cul-tural and educational programs that benefit the community. A few programs that I would like to highlight are ‘‘Ident-a-Kid’’, Celebrate Re-covery and Career Day. Additionally, Chapel Grove has sponsored college scholarships, a community daycare service called ‘‘Happy Hearts’’ and a weekend backpack stuffing program for students at Georgie D. Tyler Middle School. These pro-grams are made possible by collaborating with local governments, including Isle of Wight Sheriff’s Department. Clearly, Chapel Grove United Church of Christ’s congregation takes the call to commu-nity engagement seriously and that engage-ment is evident in their role in community sponsored events. Parishioners were influen-tial in the Town of Windsor’s Centennial Cele-bration and helped establish the Schoolhouse Museum in Smithfield, Virginia. Moreover, members of Chapel Grove participate in ‘‘Souper Saturday,’’ an annual community soup lunch charged with raising money to pro-vide financial assistance for wintertime heat-ing. Mr. Speaker, as Chapel Grove United Church of Christ celebrates this historic mile-stone, its congregation can take pride in an in-spiring 150 years of fellowship, worship and service. I would like to congratulate Reverend H. Carlyle Church, Jr. and all the members of the church’s congregation on this joyous occa-sion, and I wish them many more years full of growth and prosperity. f 
HONORING JOEY ROCHELEAU 
HON. SAM GRAVES 
OF MISSOURI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 16, 2018 Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I proudly pause to recognize Joey Rocheleau.

CELEBRATING 10 YEARS OF WILD AND SCENIC DESIGNATION FOR THE EIGHTMILE RIVER WATER-SHED 
HON. JOE COURTNEY 
OF CONNECTICUT  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 16, 2018 Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate ten years of Wild and Scenic des-ignation for eastern Connecticut’s Eightmile River Watershed. The Eightmile River Watershed is situated among the towns of Lyme, Salem, and East Haddam, Connecticut. Despite its name, the watershed is comprised of over 150 miles of pristine rivers and streams and 62 square miles of relatively undeveloped rural land. It boasts unfragmented habitats, rare and di-verse wildlife, scenic vistas, high water quality, unimpeded stream flow, and significant cul-tural features. Most notably, the overall Eightmile River Watershed ecosystem is healthy and intact throughout virtually all of its range. In 2008, under the Consolidated Natural Re-sources Act, the Eightmile River Watershed became an official part of the nation’s Wild and Scenic River System. This designation es-tablished a non-regulatory management plan to be implemented jointly by the National Park Service and the Eightmile River Wild and Sce-nic Coordinating Committee. It ensures the watershed is funded and protected well into the future. This achievement and its ten-year milestone is especially important to me, as H.R. 986, the Eightmile Wild and Scenic River

Act, was the first piece of legislation I intro-duced as a newly-elected member of Con-gress, just two months into my first term as Representative from Connecticut’s Second District. However special this legislation may be to me, I would be remiss not to thank the group of stakeholders—in particular Anthony Irving and Dr. David Bingham—who, along with many others, really got this project off the ground. The care and concern of these resi-dents, town boards, area land trusts, and river-fronting landowners led to the develop-ment of the Eightmile River Wild & Scenic Study Committee. Once a study was com-pleted, citizens from all three towns voted to support the Eightmile River Watershed Man-agement Plan and Wild and Scenic designa-tion. Each town’s land use commission, the Boards of Selectmen, and the study com-mittee followed suit, making this vision a re-ality. The Wild and Scenic designation is truly a high honor—one that is applied to less than one quarter of one percent of the nation’s riv-ers. We in eastern Connecticut are grateful to have such a small piece of Eden in our back-yard and even more grateful for those who have pledged to protect it for the past ten years. I’m confident it will be in good hands for years to come.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 16, 2018 Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Marna and John Becker of Afton, Iowa, on the very special occasion of their 60th wedding anni-versary.

CONGRATULATING ERIK FENDER 
HON. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM 
OF NEW MEXICO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 16, 2018 Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratu-late Erik Fender of San Ildefonso Pueblo in New Mexico for his role in the Pueblo Pottery Mug project and his success as a Native art-ist. The Pueblo Pottery Mug project started as a collaboration between five Pueblo artists and the first Pueblo-owned Starbucks in New Mex-ico. The mugs were first sold in 2016 at the Starbucks store in Albuquerque. Each mug was hand-crafted by a different Pueblo artist to celebrate the opening of the new store and to symbolize the collaboration between New Mexico Pueblos and Starbucks. After quickly selling out of the unique mugs—selling over 6,000 mugs—the Shumakolowa gift shop col-laborated with the artists to sell mugs at their location in the Indian Pueblo Cultural Center. Mr. Fender learned how to make pottery from his mother and grandmother, who are re-nowned potters in their own right. His work is profoundly influenced by the skills that they taught him. Hailing from a long lineage of pot-ters and artists, Mr. Fender teaches his son the pottery traditions of his family. Mr. Fender’s work is known for experi-menting with and using different designs and techniques, including traditional and contem-porary styles on polychrome, black-on-black, and black-on-red carving. He adds his own personal touch when he makes his clay, texturing it and adding stones for a unique fin-ish. Mr. Speaker, I applaud Erik Fender for being a part of the Pueblo Pottery Mug project. This project has given the community, as well as visitors to New Mexico, an oppor-tunity to appreciate usable pieces of art that are inspired by Native culture and traditions. I look forward to seeing this project continue to flourish and support talented Native artists from Pueblos throughout New Mexico. f 
HONORING SYLVIA GOMEZ GARCIA WITH CALIFORNIA’S THIRD DIS-TRICT WOMAN OF THE YEAR AWARD 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 16, 2018 Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Sylvia Gomez Garcia, better known as La Maestra, as a woman of the year. She is a dedicated teacher at Beamer Elementary School and lifelong resident of Woodland, California. Ms. Gomez Garcia’s exceptional passion for teaching has created a positive setting for learning and growth for each one of the students she teaches. Ms. Gomez Garcia teaches children in both English and Spanish at a dual immersion school where her positive teaching methods create an environment of equity where students feel safe to learn. Many of her students are recent immigrants, some children are from families with established residences in Woodland, and many are from families who are underserved. Ms. Gomez Garcia’s bilingual teaching methods place all children on an equal footing where each come out with bilingual proficiency in reading, writ-ing, and speaking. Beyond her skills and acu-men, Ms. Gomez Garcia is an exceptional mother and dedicated wife, a humanitarian and active community member. The positive impact she has had on the lives of her stu-dents cannot be overstated. HONORING BRYCE HAZEN HON. SAM GRAVES

HONORING KING RIDGE FOUNDATION 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 16, 2018 Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor King Ridge Foundation on the tenth anniversary of its founding. King Ridge Foundation has done incredible work for at-risk youth in our community and has been vital to the recovery from the October 2017 Wildfires. King Ridge Foundation was founded in 2009 by Levi Leipheimer and Carlos Perez to help at-risk youth. Since then, the Foundation has raised over 2 million dollars for this cause. A portion of this funding has come from Mr. Leipheimer’s annual Gran Fondo, a bike ride known as the best day out on two wheels that brings people together from around the world, which also celebrates its tenth anniversary this year. Through the Gran Fondo and the work of King Ridge Foundation, Mr. Leipheimer has made our community stronger and more con-nected. He is dedicated to Santa Rosa and Sonoma County, as he has shown through his commitment to improving the lives of those in our community. King Ridge Foundation’s main focus is sup-porting at-risk youth by raising awareness and money. The Foundation partners with local or-ganizations including Social Advocates for Youth, Forget Me Not Farm and The B-Rad Foundation. In times of disaster King Ridge Foundation expands its mission to assist people in return-ing to normalcy. During the devastating wildfires our community has faced, King Ridge Foundation did just that. After the 2015 Valley Fire, King Ridge Foundation raised more than $60,000 for relief efforts in Lake County. After the October 2017 Wildfires, King Ridge Foun-dation joined with Russian River Brewing Company in the Sonoma Pride partnership. The partnership has raised over 1.1 million

dollars and provided direct assistance to over 660 families. King Ridge Foundation and Sonoma Pride partnered with many other local organizations to help as many people as possible. Along with the Council on Aging, they provided $400,000 towards the purchase and installa-tion of five manufactured homes. King Ridge Foundation and Sonoma Pride also partnered with NorCal Bike Sport to replace over 500 children’s bikes that were destroyed in the fire. Mr. Speaker, King Ridge Foundation, and Levi Leipheimer, have been crucial in the re-building of our community and for the well- being of our young people. It is therefore fit-ting and proper that we honor the Foundation on its tenth anniversary.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate a great Iowa company, BB&P Feed and Grain of Winterset, Iowa on its 40th anniversary in business as well as serving the community and surrounding area.

HONORING CARL CHILTON’S 95TH BIRTHDAY 
HON. FILEMON VELA 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 16, 2018 Mr. VELA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to cele-brate the 95th birthday of Brownsville cham-pion Carl Chilton. Born in 1923, Mr. Chilton was one of four in the 1940 graduating class of Port Isabel High School. Upon graduating from high school, Mr. Chilton attended the Texas College of Arts and Industries at Kingsville—today known as Texas A&M University—Kingsville. His under-graduate career was shortened; in 1942 he enlisted in the Army Air Corps to serve our country in World War II. He earned his wings and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in 1944. Texas and the United States are for-ever grateful for his service and leadership throughout his 13 missions in France and other parts of the world as a member of the 410th Bomb Group. After serving in the military, Mr. Chilton en-rolled in the University of Texas at Austin, where he graduated with an accounting de-gree. Following graduation, he served as a professor at Brownsville Junior College, where he taught introductory business. Upon comple-tion of the CPA exam, he founded, with part-ner Bill Long, the accounting firm of Long & Chilton in 1951. Despite a slow start, the firm successfully expanded over the years and at-tracted the best talent under his leadership. The prestigious Texas Society of CPAs ac-knowledged his exceptional work in the field by electing him president of the organization in 1979. Mr. Chilton’s exemplary dedication and hard work ensured that he left the largest account-ing firm in the Valley in good hands at the time of his retirement in 1988. The now- merged offices in Brownsville, Harlingen and McAllen continue to thrive in the South Texas community. A man of family and service, Mr. Chilton never ceased to engage with the community in ways that deeply benefitted South Texas. He has been a loyal member of the Rotary Club for 53 years, served as president and chair-man of the Brownsville Public Utilities Board, and was president of the Valley Zoological So-ciety. He is also an active member of the First United Methodist Church, where he met and married the late Ruth Lewis Chilton. In addition, Mr. Chilton led the development of the nationally recognized Brownsville Ten-nis Center. As president of the Brownsville Tennis Club, he played an instrumental role in its founding and continued growth. Thanks to his work, the United States Tennis Association (USTA) chose the Brownsville Tennis Center as winner of the Facility of the Year Award in 2001. His exceptional work pioneered a move-ment encouraging fitness and recreation in the region. The highlights of his post-retirement com-munity engagement are many. He wrote books about the City of Brownsville and how to find success in the accounting world. His published work includes: ‘‘Successful Small Client Accounting Practice,’’ ‘‘The Successful Professional Client Accounting Practice: A Complete Guide to Profit Opportunities and Techniques,’’ ‘‘70 Years of Airport History in Brownsville,’’ ‘‘Fort Brown: The First Border Post,’’ ‘‘Memories of a Military Pilot: 1942 to 1945,’’ and ‘‘Brownsville Families 1848–2012.’’ His book, ‘‘Brownsville: The First 100 Years, 1848–1948,’’ serves as an important collection of the history of Brownsville and its organiza-tions that have made the city what it is today, a welcoming and kind community. Mr. Speaker, I take this opportunity to honor and celebrate Carl Chilton’s 95th birthday. I ask my colleagues to join me and Mr. Chilton’s family and friends in wishing him well on this special occasion. Mr. Chilton’s devo-tion to his family and community make him a great role model for the people of Brownsville Texas, and he exemplifies the best of South Texas.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratu-late Lisa Holt of Cochiti Pueblo in New Mexico for her role in the Pueblo Pottery Mug project and her success as a Native artist. The Pueblo Pottery Mug project started as a collaboration between five Pueblo artists and the first Pueblo-owned Starbucks in New Mex-ico.

Ms. Holt comes from an illustrious family of artists and first learned the methods of making pottery from her mother. Her work is unique because it involves collaboration with an artist from another Pueblo. In this beautiful blend of culture and art, clay from her native Pueblo is sent to Santo Domingo to be painted. Ms. Holt’s work typically incorporates traditional Cochiti traditions such as human and animal figures, but she has been working to expand some of these designs into more contem-porary forms. Mr. Speaker, I applaud Lisa Holt for being a part of the Pueblo Pottery Mug project. This project has given the community, as well as visitors to New Mexico, an opportunity to ap-preciate usable pieces of art that are inspired by Native culture and traditions. I look forward to seeing this project continue to flourish and support talented Native artists from Pueblos throughout New Mexico.
