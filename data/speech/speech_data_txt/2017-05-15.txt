NATIONAL POLICE WEEK Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, this week marks National Police Week, an annual celebration in honor of the men and women who serve in local, State, and Federal law enforcement all across our country. We are all safer because of their efforts, and this week is an im-portant reminder of their continuing service and sacrifice on our behalf— each and every day. Traveling across the country, thou-sands of law enforcement officers gath-er in our Nation’s Capital each year to mark this occasion. They come here to recommit themselves to the peace and safety of our communities and to show respect for their fallen brothers and sisters in uniform who have made the ultimate sacrifice. We are honored to have them in Washington and to join them in recognizing these officers. I wish to pay a special tribute to the brave men and women who protect and serve my home State of Kentucky. These officers put themselves in harm’s way to defend our communities every day, and we owe them a tremendous debt of gratitude. Today, we also remember those offi-cers from the Bluegrass State who tragically fell in the line of duty. First, I want to pay tribute to Officer Nick Rodman of the Louisville Metro Police Department. Officer Rodman unfortunately passed away after a car crash in Louisville while responding to calls of shots fired. He was 30 years old and had served in the department for 3 years. The Rodman family maintains a strong tradition in law enforcement, and he proudly continued that legacy. The many individuals Officer Rodman touched over the course of his life will remember his compassion, patience, and dedication to family. I wish to also pay tribute to Officer Charles Howley of the Oldham County Police Department. The day before his death, Officer Howley responded to a call reporting smoke in a daycare cen-ter. While ensuring all of the children and employees had evacuated, Officer Howley was exposed to a refrigerant. The next day, he suffered a fatal heart attack. Officer Howley was 51 years old and dedicated 20 years of service to his department and his community. Officers Nick Rodman and Charles Howley displayed courage and heroism, and their service will not soon be for-gotten. I wish to also take a moment to thank the men and women of the U.S. Capitol Police, who stand guard at the heart of our democracy. They protect the Nation’s legislature, the people who work here, and the millions of visitors who travel here to see our gov-ernment in action. We are grateful for their diligence and for their service. I ask my colleagues to join me in ex-pressing the Senate family’s gratitude to law enforcement officers all across our country as we welcome so many of them to the Capital this week. I wish to reiterate our admiration for their honorable and dangerous work. We live in a safer society because of their brave efforts, and I am glad that we are able to take this opportunity today to thank them for their service.

Jeffrey Rosen, to be Deputy Secretary of the Department of Transportation. Mr. Rosen has extensive experience serving at both the Office of Manage-ment and Budget and at the Depart-ment of Transportation. When he last came before the Senate to be the Chief Legal Officer of the Department of Transportation, he was confirmed by voice vote. It is disappointing that we had to file cloture on this bipartisan choice this time around. Mr. Rosen’s work in both the private and public sectors has given him a unique insight into the budgetary and regulatory challenges that infrastruc-ture projects face. I look forward to the Senate advancing his nomination later this afternoon.

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER  
The Democratic leader is recognized. Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first let me thank my friend and colleague from Iowa for letting me go forward. The two Charles in the Senate work to-gether whenever we can. 
NATIONAL POLICE WEEK  
First, Mr. President, I want to thank our Capitol Police, the New York po-lice, and police around the country for the outstanding work they do. Much like our troops overseas, our law en-forcement officers risk their lives for our safety. As we welcome many police officers to the Capitol this week, I would like to express, on behalf of the Senate, our gratitude for their service, their sac-rifice, and their countless daily acts of courage. Particularly, I want to say that in New York City, where we are so proud that crime is the lowest of the 25 largest cities in the country, we thank our New York City Police Department for a job well done. I would also like to thank the many police departments, sheriffs’ offices, and so many others of our law enforcement in the State of New York. I have gotten to know them, respect them, and admire them as human beings and for the job they do. RUSSIA INVESTIGATION  
Getting back to a less happy subject, Mr. President, the events of last week tested some of the fundamental pre-cepts of our democratic system, includ-ing the rule of law and the independ-ence of our law enforcement agencies that were designed to be a check on any abuse of power. The President of the United States fired the FBI Director, who was con-ducting an active investigation of the President’s campaign and its ties to Russia. The Attorney General, who had recused himself from that investiga-tion, played a role in that dismissal and continues to be involved in the se-lection of the new FBI Director. The White House gave pretextual reasons for the firing, which were contradicted by the President himself a few days later when he admitted that he had planned to fire Director Comey for weeks and that he was thinking about Russia when he did it. The President then suggested there were tapes of con-versations between himself and Direc-tor Comey, threatening to release them if Mr. Comey spoke to the press. These are not the actions of an ad-ministration that respects the rule of law or treasures fidelity to the truth. These are not the actions of an admin-istration that is eager for and even open to an independent investigation into a very serious matter—the inter-ference of our elections by a foreign ad-versary. The Founding Fathers, in their infi-nite wisdom—the more I am around, the more I am impressed with them, and I was impressed to begin with—de-signed three coequal branches of gov-ernment with appropriate powers to check and balance the others. The Founding Fathers explicitly worried about foreign powers trying to influ-ence our elections and government. They actually wrote into the Constitu-tion protections against that very threat. Their concerns, expressed over 240 years ago, gain new prominence and meaning today, perhaps more than at any time in the past. We in Congress—both parties—need to exercise the powers afforded to us by the Constitution to check and balance. We need to see that we get all the facts. We need to see that the Russia investigation is allowed to proceed as independently and as impartially as possible. We need to hold this adminis-tration accountable for any abuse of their powers. So first of all, if there are ‘‘tapes’’ as the President has suggested, he should turn them over immediately to Con-gress and the investigators. To destroy them would be a violation of law. If there are no tapes, he should apologize to James Comey and to the American people for misleading them. Second, the fact that the President has said that he may have taped Mr. Comey makes the need for a special prosecutor all the more important. If it is true, if there are tapes, a special prosecutor would have the ability to 
VerDate Sep 11 2014 00:09 May 16, 2017 Jkt 069060 PO 00000 Frm 00002 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G15MY6.001 S15MYPT1lotter on DSK5VPTVN1PROD with SENATE
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2925 May 15, 2017 
obtain these tapes undeterred, and then he would examine them to see what wrongdoing, if any, has occurred. The reasons for a special prosecutor are compelling. A special prosecutor is not subject to day-to-day supervision by the Attorney General or anyone else at the Justice Department. He or she would have greater latitude in whom they can subpoena, which questions to ask, and how to conduct the investiga-tion. He or she would have purview to investigate, not only the subject but also anyone who attempts to interfere with the investigation. There is built- in congressional oversight, and Con-gress is notified whenever a special prosecutor is appointed, removed, or finished with the investigation. He or she can only be removed for cause, not to quash an investigation. With the events of the past week— and given that we have different sto-ries coming out of this administration from different people—the need to have someone who is independent and far away from any of the actors, to get to the bottom of this, is so important. Firing the FBI Director is extremely rare and deeply troubling. We need the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. Third, we in the Congress need to hear testimony from Director Comey, as well as be briefed by Attorney Gen-eral Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein. I understand that Director Comey declined an invitation to testify tomorrow, but I have no rea-son to believe he won’t be willing to come before the Senate in the future. I hope that he will sooner rather than later and that those appearances are in a public setting. This week, on Thurs-day, Deputy Attorney General Rosen-stein will brief the full Senate on the events of the last week. Again, I thank the majority leader for joining me in that request. Again, I hope we can make as much of that information pub-lic as possible. The American people deserve to know the truth just as much, if not more, than the Senate does. My caucus still believes that Attor-ney General Sessions must be made available to the Senate in a similar ca-pacity, given his reported role in firing Director Comey and in helping select his replacement. Considering his recusal from the Russia investigation, his close involvement in these events warrants the Senate’s questioning as well. To repeat, we need the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. The Russian meddling is so serious, and it is no place for partisan fighting. Frankly, we need our Republican col-leagues to help to get to the bottom of what happened in the 2016 elections and to hold this or any administration ac-countable when they don’t tell the truth. If only one party is doing the talking, the issue will seem too par-tisan to the American people. A subject as important as this one—the tam-pering of our elections by a foreign power, a matter the Founders fretted about at the dawning of the Republic— shouldn’t be colored by partisan poli-tics. It is time to put country before party. We need our Republican friends to help us call upon the White House to get an independent investigation on Russia. We need them to speak out when the White House misleads the public. No less than the integrity of our system of government and the rule of law is at stake. 
TRUMPCARE  
Mr. President, a word on healthcare. As the Senate Republican caucus de-bates what to do on healthcare, they should take a hard look at the con-sequences of the House Republican bill on individual Americans. Last week, Senate Democrats met with four Amer-icans who shared their stories and ex-plained how they would be hurt by TrumpCare. Because of the furor over Director Comey’s firing, their voices may have been drowned out. So I want-ed to repeat a few of their stories. We heard from Cindi Johnson from Bloomington, IN, whose daughter was born with Down syndrome, a pre-existing condition. Ms. Johnson was approaching the lifetime coverage limit on her plan when healthcare re-form was passed, which eliminated the limit. That policy change, as well as Medicaid, helped Ms. Johnson and her family climb out from under a moun-tain of medical debt and get the care they needed for their daughter. Every parent so much wants to help a child who is sick. That might be taken away from the Cindi Johnsons of the world if the House bill is passed. Under TrumpCare, States are no longer re-quired to prohibit lifetime limits, and Medicaid is cut by $880 billion. Let’s think of the Ms. J
OHNSON s and their daughters and sons. We also heard from Michael Dunkley from Alexandria, VA. Mr. Dunkley is a 64-year-old fulltime caregiver for his wife, who has advanced MS. In 2013, shortly after being laid off, Mr. Dunkley was diagnosed with an aggres-sive stage IV non-Hodgkin lymphoma, but his insurance coverage through COBRA was set to expire at the end of the year. Mr. Dunkley was able to sign up for insurance on Virginia’s market-place that provided coverage despite his preexisting condition. Under TrumpCare, Mr. Dunkley could be charged five times or more by the in-surance companies because he is older. He could also be priced out of insur-ance because of his preexisting condi-tion. President Trump and the Repub-licans promised better and cheaper healthcare for everyone, but these Americans and many more like them— perhaps millions, pretty certainly mil-lions—would be devastated by TrumpCare. It is another colossal promise to folks like Mr. Dunkley, Ms. Johnson, and her daughter. So my Republican friends in the Sen-ate, I hope you will listen to these sto-ries and the stories of your constitu-ents saying so many of the same things. To take away healthcare from the Johnsons and the Dunkleys to give a tax break to the very wealthiest of Americans—hundreds of thousands of dollars for people who make tens of millions of dollars—no American would be for that, but that is what is in the bill in the House, and that is where the Republican Senate bill, despite all the talk back and forth, is aiming to go. My Republican friends here in the Senate, please, listen to these stories. Drop repeal. Drop TrumpCare. Work with Democrats on ways to improve our healthcare system and bring costs down. We can move forward together, or Republicans can move backward on their own. WORLDWIDE CYBER ATTACK  
Lastly, Mr. President, I want to make a note about the worldwide cyber attack. So far, according to the New York Times, the attack has afflicted at least 200,000 computers in more than 150 countries. It is a sobering reminder that cyber attacks are one of the cen-tury’s greatest challenges. They con-tinue to get larger in scale, broader in scope, and more malicious in intent. It is time we stopped talking about the threat of cyber attacks and actually started doing something about it. A few years ago, the Senate tried to pass a bill to protect our critical infra-structure from cyber attacks, but some of our friends on the other side of the aisle blocked it to defend a business community that didn’t want to share information necessary to fight these challenges. I hope this global cyber at-tack serves as a wakeup call and re-news bipartisan interest in protecting the United States, the country we love, and in protecting our hospitals, our universities, our businesses, our intel-lectual property, our credit files, elec-tion systems, and critical infrastruc-tures from cyber attacks. I yield the floor for my friend from Iowa. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-pore. The Senator from Iowa. 
REPEALING AND REPLACING OBAMACARE  
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, let me assure the Senator from New York that I am willing to listen to his sto-ries about how people might be af-fected by the health care debate that is going on in the Congress right now if he will listen to some of the stories I have to tell. By the middle of June, people in 94 of the 99 counties in Iowa may not be able to buy insurance through the Obamacare exchanges. Senator S
CHUMER talked about the tough consequences of the House bill on healthcare. I am coming to the Sen-ate floor today to talk about the tough consequences of ObamaCare. I rise today to speak some more about the Affordable Care Act. The law is collapsing before our eyes. After 7 years of ObamaCare, it continues to overreach, overpromise, and overstay its welcome for the American people. I want to tell you the history about a bridge that relates very much to what is happening to ObamaCare today.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES2926 May 15, 2017 
Before I dive into the details of how ObamaCare is denying people in the State of Iowa the ability to get health insurance, I want to share a story about a bridge in the State of Wash-ington. This bridge is depicted right here. This is the collapse of that bridge. The bridge is called Tacoma Narrows Bridge. It was built in 1940. It was the world’s third largest suspension bridge. It was considered a state-of-the-art masterpiece of 20th-century engineer-ing, but the bridge was set to fail from the very beginning. On July 1, 1940, the $6 million bridge opened to traffic. Just 5 months later, on November 7, 1940, the bridge col-lapsed. What caused the massive steel and concrete structure to twist, turn, and drop nearly 200 feet into Puget Sound? Importantly, there was a key foreshadowing clue. The bridge was nicknamed ‘‘Galloping Gertie’’ for its dancing, swaying bridge deck. On most days, it resembled a roller coaster roll-ing in the wind. But on the morning of November 7, Gertie’s dance became twisted in a howling 40-mile-an-hour wind. Dramatic footage shown here shows tons of concrete and steel cables snapping like fishing lines before its collapse. Gertie essentially self-de-structed due to design flaws that cre-ated sheer havoc in those high winds. Like ObamaCare, the Tacoma Nar-rows Bridge wasn’t built to last, and like Galloping Gertie, ObamaCare is on a self-destruction course with destiny. Galloping Gertie collapsed by a flawed design that was unable to withstand high winds, and every day that goes by without a bipartisan solution to fix the flaws, ObamaCare is moving the Amer-ican people closer to a calamity. Sooner rather than later, ObamaCare will become its own bridge to nowhere, with no insurance plans on the ex-changes. Millions of Americans will be left twisting high and dry. The warning signs can no longer be ignored. First, many health insurers are bailing. The individual market is near collapse. Just last week, another insurance company, Aetna, announced it will quit the remaining two States it planned to sell plans in under ObamaCare. That means in 2018, Aetna will sell zero plans on the individual market ex-changes. Just a year ago, in 2016, Aetna participated in the individual markets in 778 counties across the country. In 2017, that number fell to 242. In 2018, that number will be zero. We ought to repeat this story be-cause everybody is talking about what the House health care bill might do to people’s health insurance and their healthcare. The fact is that people can’t buy health insurance, or if they buy it, the deductibles are so high they can’t afford it. That is the story we ought to be telling at least with equal weight with the stories given by people who are talking about not wanting to do anything with healthcare. My home State has been hit particu-larly hard by insurers pulling out of the individual market. In 2016, UnitedHealth Group announced it would leave Iowa the following year. Last month, Aetna and Wellmark an-nounced they would be pulling out of the individual market in Iowa. This leaves 94 of our 99 counties in Iowa with one choice for health insurance on the individual market. A constituent wrote to me following the news of their departure. 
My son recently turned 26 years old and is ineligible to remain on my insurance; there-fore, he signed up for his own policy through Wellmark. My son farms with my husband, so while my husband has coverage through me, my son may soon be facing the fact that he will not be able to buy health insurance. My son, a true ‘‘beginning farmer,’’ will be forced to leave our farming operation and seek employment solely for the purpose of health care coverage. 
If Congress doesn’t act, the indi-vidual market may come crashing down, just like the Tacoma Narrows bridge. We simply can’t ignore another warning sign. Healthier, younger peo-ple are choosing the off-ramp. The toll to join ObamaCare is turning out to be unaffordable for them. ObamaCare is unsustainable. Remarkably, instead of joining us to fix this broken bridge, the other side wants to leave Americans twisting in the wind. In my home State, 70,000 Iowans are enrolled in the individual exchanges, and the last carrier left, Medica, is on the fence about its plans for 2018. That is why I told Senator S
CHUMER to listen to our stories. The people in 94 of Iowa’s 99 counties may not even be able to buy insurance on the exchange. The day has come. It is time to cross the bridge. It is time to repeal and re-place ObamaCare before it finishes its collapse. I yield the floor. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-pore. The Senator from Arkansas. 
NATIONAL POLICE WEEK  
Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to law enforcement offi-cers from Arkansas and all across the country who are called to serve and to protect. I am grateful for their dedica-tion and commitment because it takes a very special person to put his life on the line every day to protect our com-munities. Arkansans are proud of the law en-forcement history in our State. In my hometown of Fort Smith, AR, the U.S. Marshals Service has a deep-rooted his-tory that has helped shape our Nation’s westward expansion. Today, many peo-ple in the area find their family roots traced back to a U.S. Marshal. As home to the future U.S. Marshals Museum, the community and the State have ral-lied around this proud heritage. The tradition of courageous public service is carried on today by the men and women who keep communities across the country safe 24 hours a day. This week, members from law en-forcement agencies from around the Nation will join together in Wash-ington to honor their fallen brothers and sisters who have died in the line of duty. May 15 marks Peace Officers Me-morial Day, and this week is recog-nized as National Police Week. We take this opportunity to honor the men and women who have died in the line of duty by adding their names to the Na-tional Law Enforcement Officers Me-morial. This year, nearly 400 names will be added to the memorial, including these Arkansans: Robert Barker, a patrol-man for the McCrory Police Depart-ment, who died while serving the peo-ple of Woodruff County on September 15, 2016; Corporal Bill Cooper, of the Se-bastian County Sheriff’s Office, who gave his life in the line of duty on Au-gust 10, 2016; and Corrections Officer Lisa Mauldin, who died in service to the community on December 18, 2016. These Arkansans represent the self-less sacrifice that our law enforcement personnel embody. It is the truest tes-tament to the life that they chose—to serve their communities. I am sad to say that the name of an-other Arkansas law enforcement officer will be carved into the memorial. Yell County Sheriff’s Deputy Kevin Mainhart was killed in the line of duty last week. He was a veteran officer with more than 20 years of serving and protecting Arkansas communities. I offer my condolences and my gratitude to his family and friends and the law enforcement community as they cope with this unspeakable tragedy. Our law enforcement officers are true heroes. We recognize, not only during this week but all year long, the devo-tion of the 900,000 law enforcement offi-cers whose service each and every day makes our communities safer. I was proud to recognize the service and sacrifice of these first responders and show my support for their commit-ment to our safety during a tour of Ar-kansas last year that we called Every Second Counts. First responders invest so much of their lives in public service that one must take the opportunity to commend them for their tireless efforts and willingness to serve in a crisis at a moment’s notice. The role of law enforcement is chang-ing. These men and women perform a variety of roles from responding to emergencies to maintaining public safety and promoting safety services and programs. In Arkansas, we are blessed to have the Criminal Justice Institute, which is a part of the Univer-sity of Arkansas System. It is a re-source to police departments and sher-iffs’ offices that provides them with up-dated training and information as they adapt to provide more services to their communities. As a member of the Senate Law En-forcement Caucus, I am deeply com-mitted to supporting the Criminal Jus-tice Institute and advocating for the policies and resources that law enforce-ment agencies need to successfully carry out their missions, as well as honoring those lives that are tragically cut short while in the line of duty.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2927 May 15, 2017 
That is why I am proud to cosponsor the Honoring Hometown Heroes Act, which allows Governors to order the American flag to fly at half-staff in recognition of the sacrifice of the first responders who make the ultimate sac-rifice. The House of Representatives passed similar legislation earlier this month, and I am hopeful that it will also have the support of this Chamber. I thank the law enforcement officers in Arkansas and across the country who dedicate their lives to protecting our children and communities and seek to bring criminals to justice. These he-roes come to our rescue when we need help, and I am committed to con-tinuing to advocate for these officers. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. E
RNST ). The majority whip. Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, this is National Police Week—a time each year when we remember and honor those who have fallen in the line of duty. There are more than 900,000 law en-forcement officers serving in our coun-try, and tragically every year dozens lose their lives defending our commu-nities and our freedoms. This year, as part of National Police Week, I am so thankful that Javier Vega, Jr., one of Texas’s own, was hon-ored at the National Law Enforcement Officer Memorial over the weekend, right here in Washington, DC. Just a few hours ago, I had the honor of meet-ing his family—his wife, his children, and his parents—along with several of his friends whom he served alongside in the U.S. Border Patrol. They know, all too well, the high cost paid by our law enforcement offi-cers who put themselves at risk every day. Javier—who was known by his close family and friends as Harvey— grew up in La Feria, TX, a small town in South Texas. He was a man known for putting others before himself— someone who would always serve rath-er than be served. That desire turned first into a mili-tary career. He enlisted in the Marine Corps right out of high school, and later he put himself through college. Then he decided he hadn’t done all he wanted to do in public service so he joined the Border Patrol, and just like everything else he pursued in life, he dedicated himself to tirelessly serving others and serving his country. Sadly, that service was cut short when he and his family, while out on a fishing trip on a Sunday afternoon, were ambushed by two men who tried to rob them. The clash turned violent. Javier immediately thought of pro-tecting others before himself so he jumped into action to fend off the attackers and defend his family. Tragically, he was killed by the two men—illegal immigrant criminals who had been reportedly deported but man-aged repeatedly to find their way back into the country, even after commit-ting serious crimes. What a testament to the great need we have to strength-en our border security and justice sys-tem to keep us all safe. Now, there is no denying that Javier Vega, Jr., was taken from his family, his community, and from all of us far too soon. So while we consider the fall-en this week, like Javier, and their lives of service, I hope we can also take time to consider how we can better support and serve those who have promised to defend us to the point of risking their very lives. As we learn from the story of Javier, one obvious way we can do that is by making sure our Federal laws are fully enforced to protect our communities from those who would take advantage of our generosity and commit violent crimes, even though they are not in the country legally. We have a chance to do more for our law enforcement officers, and we should always look for ways to do right by them. Now isn’t the time to look the other way or to pretend that real problems facing our Nation and our law enforcement community will simply go away. So during this year’s National Police Week, I look forward to playing my part to put forward policies that better support their mission to defend and protect communities all across the country. Let me thank the family of Javier Vega, Jr.—particularly his wife, his children, and his parents who are here with us today—for letting me share his story and honor his service. Madam President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, I rise today to recognize National Police Week and the service and sacrifice of our country’s law enforcement officers. As past Governor of the State of West Virginia, I worked with West Virginia State Police very often and saw first-hand their dedication to the rule of law and commitment to keeping West Vir-ginians safe. Last year, the State of West Virginia lost one of our own, West Virginia State Police first sergeant Joseph Portaro. Joseph was from Clarksburg and joined the State police in 1998 and served in Kingwood. In 2008, he was as-signed staff officer at the academy and was then promoted to deputy director of training. Joseph was a veteran of the West Virginia Army National Guard and served in the West Virginia State Police for 17 years. Although the loss of Joseph will never heal, I know I join all West Vir-ginians and the entire law enforcement community in praying for Joseph’s family and friends. National Police Week acknowledges the service and sacrifice of our coun-try’s law enforcement officers and the safety and protection they provide our communities. Madam President, I know you do too. I go to a lot of schools and talk to the children. I want them to understand that anytime they see a person in uniform, whether it be a policeman, fireman, or EMT, these are people willing to get in front of harm’s way for their safety and sac-rifice themselves for them. When you have a police officer willing to take a bullet for you, that is a pretty special person. They don’t do it for the pay. I think we all know that. They are dedi-cated and committed to the well-being and safety of every American. We are very lucky to have them in our respec-tive States of Iowa and West Virginia. This week, we must remember Jo-seph and the other 139 law enforcement officers who lost their lives in the line of duty in 2016 and continue to support their families as they continue to mourn their loss. We can never bring back the person who basically sac-rificed for all of us, but we can make sure we never forget their families, and I hope we all do that. This is a special week and a special day for these people we recognize. One hundred and thirty-nine people gave their lives for us. The least we can do is make sure that not only do we re-member them but that we go beyond that in order to support the members of the family, their children who need a father or mother they might not have now, who need the nurturing and the fi-nancial support for their education so they can continue to grow to be good, healthy, productive adults. I hope we never forget. Madam President, I suggest the ab-sence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I rise today in strong support of Jeffrey Rosen to be the Deputy Secretary of Transportation. It is my understanding that later this evening we will have a vote on that nomination. It will be the first of a couple of votes. I would just ask my colleagues on the Democratic side and on the Republican side to look carefully at his qualifica-tions and to be in a position to support this good public servant to be the new deputy at Transportation. I recall that this body overwhelm-ingly supported Elaine Chao to be the Secretary of Transportation. She is doing a terrific job, in my view. She needs help, and she needs a deputy in place. Jeff has gone through the proper process. We have had hearings, and he has been voted on in committee. It is time to get him there to help Secretary Chao to be able to have her team in place and accomplish the goals that so many of us share.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES2928 May 15, 2017 
Jeffrey is a graduate of Northwestern University and Harvard Law School. Here in DC, where there are lots of law-yers, he is one of the most respected ones. He has 30 years of experience han-dling very complicated, high-stakes cases. He has litigated in more than 20 States. He has been in just about every setting imaginable: jury trials, bench trials, arbitrations, appellate argu-ments—on every topic—contracts, antitrust, securities, business torts, en-forcement actions, product liability, and class actions. You name it, and he has been involved. He has a lot of experience. Maybe particularly relevant to this job at Transportation, in 2003 he was unani-mously confirmed by this body to serve as the Chief Legal Officer at the De-partment of Transportation. There he supervised more than 400 lawyers at the Department of Transportation. As the top lawyer there, he wasn’t afraid to roll up his sleeves and get involved in lots of issues, including policy issues. I think the kind of experience he gained there will make him very well qualified to serve now as Deputy Secretary of that same agency. He did such a good job that in 2006 I reached out to him and asked him to join my team at the Office of Manage-ment and Budget. I wanted somebody who was a good lawyer but also some-one who could manage well and give me good advice, and Jeffrey Rosen was that person. I recruited Jeff to serve as general counsel and senior policy advi-sor at OMB. In that role, he was always vigilant about the use of taxpayer dol-lars, a guy who understands those hard-earned dollars need to be stewarded properly. He was someone who focused on management in the De-partment. He understood the need for us to ensure that taxpayers are getting the best bang for the buck, and, finally, maybe most important, he gave me good advice. He was insightful but also honest. I think that kind of candid ad-vice is exactly what every Department Secretary or leader would want, and that is what he will provide should he become Deputy Secretary. Since that time, I have stayed up with Jeff. He has continued to give me good advice and counsel. He is a guy who is well regarded in the legal com-munity here in town and someone who understands how the Department of Transportation works and what is needed to ensure that it will be suc-cessful. One thing that Jeff and I have in common is we married way over our heads. Kathleen is an Ohioan. She has the Ohio commonsense that makes Jeff, in my view, an even better public servant. They have three amazing kids—Anne, Sally, and James—and for all of Jeff’s personal and professional accomplishments, he would be the first to say that his greatest pride is in his family—and rightly so, by the way. In my view, Jeff has the judgment, he certainly has the experience, he has the skills, and he has the right apti-tude to be the Deputy Secretary of Transportation. He is needed now, and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the cloture motion today on his nomi-nation and in favor of his nomination to ensure we can get him in place to help move the Department of Transpor-tation forward. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. D
AINES ). The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. 
NATIONAL POLICE WEEK  
Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I rise to honor and recognize the folks who are first to respond when crisis strikes— the folks who patrol our streets, keep our families safe, and are willing to enter harm’s way on a daily basis. I rise today to honor our police offi-cers in Montana and every corner of the country. Police officers answer a call to duty to protect and defend our communities. While this Nation’s po-lice forces are on patrol, it is critical that the folks in this body are doing everything we can to keep them safe on the job and to honor their service. To recognize National Police Week, I have partnered with Senators B
OOZ-
MAN, G ARDNER , M ORAN , U DALL , B
LUMENTHAL , and C ARPER to introduce the bipartisan Honoring Hometown He-roes Act. Our bill will provide the Gov-ernor of each State the ability to fly the American flag at half-staff to honor a police officer or any first re-sponder who dies in the line of duty. This bill will treat our fallen respond-ers with the respect they deserve. In the past, Republicans and Demo-crats have worked together to strengthen resources for local police officers, and we have ensured that our first responders have access to critical healthcare services, but this bill is a bit different. This bill makes sure that our police officers and their families receive the recognition they deserve for their selfless service to their com-munities. When tragedy strikes, I think it is important the entire State takes a moment to honor that police officer who was lost while serving oth-ers. This bipartisan bill has the support of police officers and first responders from across the country—from the Fra-ternal Order of Police, the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, the International Association of Fire Chiefs, and the International Associa-tion of Firefighters, just to name a few. The Honoring Hometown Heroes Act will give our fallen first responders the honor they so much deserve, but for the police officers we have already lost, it is too late. Today is Peace Officers Memorial Day. Across the country, the names of fallen officers will be carved into granite, and their photos will be hung in stations for all to see. Yet these folks and their families did not have the honor of seeing their entire States mourn alongside them because flags were never flown at half-staff. To ensure that these folks get the recognition they deserve, today I en-shrine in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD  the names of 128 law enforcement offi-cials who have died in the line of duty. They have made the ultimate sacrifice while protecting their neighbors and keeping our communities safe. I ask unanimous consent that their names be printed in the R

Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I rise to voice my strong support for the nomi-nation of Jeff Rosen to be the next Deputy Secretary of Transportation. Mr. Rosen has had a long and distin-guished career in transportation policy and public service. He is currently a partner at the law firm of Kirkland & Ellis, where he has worked on a range of regulatory and litigation matters for more than 30 years. Prior to starting his career at the firm, he obtained his bachelor’s degree in economics at Northwestern University and his law degree from Harvard Law School. Mr. Rosen’s private sector experience has been punctuated by significant leadership positions in the public sec-tor. Mr. Rosen served as the General Counsel of the Department of Trans-portation from 2003 to 2006 after win-ning Senate confirmation by a voice vote. He also served as the General Counsel and Senior Policy Adviser at the White House Office of Management and Budget from 2006 to 2009. Mr. Rosen’s prior experience in government is a testament to his ability to lead, manage, and effectively operate within the Federal Government. If confirmed as Deputy Secretary of Transportation, Mr. Rosen will be re-sponsible for overseeing the daily oper-ations of the Department. He will also oversee the DOT’s 10 modal administra-tions and approximately 55,000 employ-ees and will exercise stewardship for the Department’s budget and its efforts to provide funding for State and local transportation projects. Mr. Rosen’s fundamental responsi-bility will be to ensure that the DOT’s crucial mission—the safe and efficient movement of goods and people across our Nation and the world—is achieved while fostering innovation and main-taining the reliability of our infra-structure. As I mentioned, Mr. Rosen brings valuable experience to this position. As the DOT’s General Counsel during the George W. Bush administration, Mr. Rosen had responsibility for the DOT’s regulatory programs, enforcement, liti-gation activities, legal issues relating to international transportation activi-ties, and legislative proposals. He acted as counsel to Secretary Norman Mi-neta. Later, as General Counsel and Senior Policy Adviser at the OMB, Mr. Rosen served as the Bush administra-tion’s top lawyer for regulations, fiscal issues, and executive orders. Of note, during the past 2 years, Mr. Rosen has served as chair of the Amer-ican Bar Association’s Section of Ad-ministrative Law and Regulatory Prac-tice, where he has been praised for revi-talizing the section with more debate and programs while seeking consensus on recommended changes to the Ad-ministrative Procedure Act. His thoughtful leadership will be valuable as the Department of Transportation looks toward a pro-growth agenda in the transportation sector. On March 29, 2017, I held a hearing in the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee to consider his nomination. I was impressed, as were my colleagues on the committee, with Mr. Rosen’s credentials, experi-ence, and depth of knowledge on trans-portation policy. On April 5, 2017, the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Com-mittee acted by a rollcall vote to fa-vorably report his nomination to the floor. While it is my hope that the Sen-ate will confirm this exceptionally well-qualified nominee today, it is my understanding that some of my Demo-crat colleagues will oppose him. It is my understanding that their decision is, in large part, because Mr. Rosen re-fused to publicly oppose President Trump’s proposed budget at his con-firmation hearing last month. I think this is an unfair basis for opposing such a well-qualified nominee. I believe Mr. Rosen’s extensive and distinguished career in transportation policy and prior public service will be an asset in addressing the infrastruc-ture challenges our Nation faces. I look forward to confirming Mr. Rosen’s nomination, and I urge my col-leagues to support his nomination. Mr. President, I yield the floor.

ANTI-LGBTQ VIOLENCE IN CHECHNYA Mr. BROWN. Madam President, today, with deep concerns, I wish to speak about the treatment of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer— LGBTQ—individuals in Chechnya, in southern Russia. Starting in early April of this year, news reports from the region told the horrific story of gay men being de-tained, tortured, and in some cases killed on the basis of their sexual ori-entation. At lease 100 gay men—and ac-cording to some press reports, as many as several hundred—were held and tor-tured in secret detention facilities in Chechyna. At least three men were killed: one after being tortured by au-thorities and two following calls by local officials encouraging so-called honor killings. As one Russian gay rights activist noted, ‘‘there is little doubt that we are dealing with crimes against humanity.’’ Stories of men being tortured and interrogated to re-veal fellow LGBTQ individuals are also deeply disturbing. Ramzan Kadyrov, the Head of the Chechen Republic, has made a number of troubling comments that LGBTQ in-dividuals ‘‘don’t exist’’ in Chechnya, an abhorrent denial of the human rights of LGBTQ individuals in Chechnya. Ac-cording to accounts by the British For-eign Ministry, Kadyrov is planning to ‘‘eliminate’’ gay men in Chechnya be-fore the beginning of the religious month of Ramadan at the end of May. State-sanctioned violence that targets individuals based on their sexual ori-entation demands international con-demnation, and the United States must be a strong voice for the human rights of all individuals. Though Russian President Vladimir V. Putin has stated he will support an inquiry into these reports, Russia’s track record shows a lack of serious commitment to human rights, particu-larly on LGBTQ issues. I commend the work of nongovern-mental organizations in Russia and abroad who have worked to evacuate LGBTQ individuals from Chechnya, and I am heartened by the advocacy of many Ohioans on this important issue. The U.S. must stand as a fierce advo-cate for the inalienable rights of all in-dividuals. I urge the administration to take a strong stance in defense of human rights and publically condemn these acts of barbarous inhumanity. We must never forget lessons of the past concerning what happens when we allow unchecked hatred and bigotry to manifest, and we must always preserve the U.S. as a beacon of hope for indi-viduals around the world. f 
TRIBUTE TO HMONG AMERICAN VETERANS Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, I am honored to recognize a remarkable coalition of veterans today. Every year on May 15, Alaskan Hmong American Vietnam veterans come together to celebrate Hmong American Veterans Memorial Day in remembrance of Gen-eral Vang Pao’s final flight out of Laos. From February 1961 to May 1975, Hmong fighters from the hill country in Laos risked their homes, their fami-lies, and their lives to join the United States and South Vietnam in the fight against communist oppression. They undoubtedly knew that, whether they won or lost the war, life would never be the same for them; yet they willingly chose to serve. For nearly three dec-ades, their involvement was kept a se-cret, in what is now commonly referred to as ‘‘the Secret War.’’ Mr. Pasert Lee, a resident of the Mountain View neighborhood in An-chorage, AK, is one of those honorable Hmong American veterans. He served as a lieutenant in General Vang Pao’s army and played a role in rescuing downed American pilots and returning them to American Forces in South Vietnam. He tells me that, under the leadership of the general, Hmong forces rescued nearly 50 pilots and were re-sponsible for saving countless Amer-ican lives. Many people do not realize that more than 40,000 Hmong were killed or wounded in support of free-dom in Vietnam. May 15, 1975, marked the beginning of the exodus of the Hmong people from their homes in Laos. Mr. Lee, like most of our honorable Hmong American vet-erans, have never returned home—even to visit—in fear for their lives. Having lost tens of thousands of our Hmong allies in support of the United States in Vietnam, it is appropriate that we acknowledge and honor the sacrifices of those like Mr. Pasert Lee and all the Hmong veterans who worked tirelessly to protect, rescue, and defend American servicemembers and downed American pilots on the Ho Chi Minh Trail. The efforts of the Hmong people have never properly been acknowledged and, like many of our Vietnam veterans, were never properly appreciated. Today, more than 40 years after the end of ‘‘the Secret War,’’ I would like

TRIBUTE TO COLONEL PATRICK KERR ∑Mr. M
CCAIN. Madam President, today I wish to recognize the military career of COL Patrick Kerr, who is re-tiring from Active Duty on June 1, 2017 after serving more than 26 years in the U.S. Army. Colonel Kerr was commissioned into the Army as a second lieutenant through the ROTC program at James Madison University in 1990. Over the course of his long career, Colonel Kerr served at every leadership level in the Army from platoon leader in the 63rd Signal Battalion to brigade com-mander of the Army Information Sys-tems Engineering Command at Fort Huachuca. During his brigade com-mand, Colonel Kerr’s unit defended Army networks against daily attacks and conducted cyber space and network operations in support of the warfighter. Throughout his time in the Army, Colonel Kerr has been a leader in the incredibly important battlefield of cyber security and network commu-nications. It is difficult to imagine as-pects of the military that have changed more in the last quarter century than military communications, information technology, and cyber security. Colonel Kerr provided extraordinary leadership for the Army to navigate through the many challenges of building, operating, and protecting Army and Defense De-partment communications networks. Prior to his current assignment in Arizona, Colonel Kerr was the deputy operations officer for recently created Army Cyber Command. He also com-manded the 53rd Signal Battalion, which operates the Department of De-fense’s constellation of military com-mand and control satellites, providing secure and protected communications around the globe. Colonel Kerr also served as executive officer of the 44th Signal Battalion for its deployment to Afghanistan during the first par-liamentary elections for the new gov-ernment in 2005. As a young officer, Colonel Kerr also deployed to Somalia for Operation Continue Hope; to Kosovo as part of the NATO stabiliza-tion force operations; and to Central Command for Operation Provide Com-fort. Colonel Kerr has received numerous awards, including the Legion of Merit, with oakleaf cluster, Bronze Star, De-fense Meritorious Service Medal, with two oakleaf clusters, and the Meri-torious Service Medal, with two oakleaf clusters). He has earned the U.S. Air Force Space Badge and is a re-cipient of the Signal Corps Regiment Silver Order of Mercury. Finally, Colonel Kerr provided mentorship to countless soldiers throughout his career. He is known for going the extra mile in professionally developing his subordinates and truly preparing them for their next leader-ship role. In fact, Colonel Kerr’s advice and counsel is regularly sought by all who work with him to include his peers and superiors. Colonel Kerr is retiring in Vail, AZ, with his family. He has been married to his wife, Wendy, for over 25 years, and they have two children, Noelle and Peter. For a career soldier, the support of family is vital, and I sincerely thank Wendy, Noelle, and Peter for their sac-rifice and support during their numer-ous deployments and moves. For a career of exceptional service to the Army and to the Nation, I con-gratulate COL Patrick Kerr on his re-tirement and I wish him and his family well in their future endeavors. ∑

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS By Mr. KAINE (for himself and Mr. T
ESTER ): S. 1125. A bill to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to provide Fed-eral Pell Grants to Iraq and Afghani-stan veteran’s dependents; to the Com-mittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, when a United States servicemember gives their life in service to their country, they often leave behind family who we are equally indebted. Ensuring that these survivors are provided every op-portunity to succeed and get a quality education supports our values and up-holds our promise to servicemembers and military families. Unfortunately, our ability to uphold our promise to dependents of servicemembers who were killed in action (KIA) in Iraq and Afghanistan following the attacks on September 11, 2001 was affected re-cently. In May 2016 the U.S. Department of Education sent a letter to institutions of higher education requiring them to reduce the Iraq and Afghanistan Serv-ice Grant awards by 7% or roughly $400 per student. These grants are critical for students to use for tuition, books, and room and board and any future cut would be significant for a young col-lege student. Many children and de-pendents of servicemembers who were KIA in Iraq and Afghanistan are now reaching college age so more and more students will not be receiving as much in grants as they should be getting and rightfully deserve. Today, I am pleased to introduce with my colleague Senator T
ESTER the Protect our Gold Star Families’ Edu-cation Act of 2017. This legislation will move the Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant program to the Pell Grant pro-gram to stabilize the funding source for these awards and ensure Gold Star families have access to the maximum Pell Grant funding available if they previously did not qualify for Pell Grants. The program would maintain the same eligibility requirements under the existing Iraq and Afghani-stan Service Grants—parent or guard-ian having died as a result of military service in Iraq or Afghanistan after 9/11 and are 24 years old or younger—and the award would continue to equal the maximum Pell Grant for that award year. While Virginia public universities al-ready offer tuition assistance to de-pendents whose parents were killed in action or were permanently disabled under the state’s Virginia Military Survivors and Dependents Education Program (VMSDEP), these funds could be used to offset tuition at private in-stitutions and could also cover addi-tional expenses, including room and board, books, and supplies. Over 500 Virginians have attended or are cur-rently attending college at public uni-versities with assistance through VMSDEP and would qualify for these Pell Grants as well. Our Gold Star families have made the ultimate sacrifice for this country and ensuring they have access to a quality college education is the right thing to do. Moving the Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant under the Pell Grant program will provide more security to Gold Star families and help ease the burden of college costs. As more of our post 9/11 Gold Star children are start-ing to reach college age, now is the right time to improve the grant sys-tem. I hope that my colleagues will in-corporate this bill in a reauthorization of the Higher Education Act. f

IN RECOGNITION OF THE GRAND OPENING OF DELIRIUM CAFE´ 
HON. BARBARA COMSTOCK 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, May 15, 2017 Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the grand opening of Delirium Cafe ´ in Leesburg, Virginia, a world renowned inter-national franchise known for its great food and extensive beer selection. Delirium Cafe ´’s flag- ship franchise is located in Brussels, Belgium, and this grand opening marks its first location in the United States. While offering some clas-sic dishes and beers, and yet at the same time being situated at the corner of South King Street and Loudoun Street, Delirium Cafe ´will provide its patrons with a traditional Belgian experience right here in Virginia’s 10th District. Curtis Allred, former manager of the Shoes Cup & Cork and a Leesburg native, traveled to Brussels six years ago and has since dreamed of opening a Delirium Cafe ´here in the United States. This dream started to come to fruition earlier this year, as he, his business partner, Rick Leith, and Aislin Kavaldjian, who will serve as the Assistant General Manager of Delirium Cafe´, began working tirelessly to open the doors of this restaurant after signing their first lease on January 1, 2017. Since then, Mr. Allred has leased two additional con-nected spaces, and the restaurant now has the capacity to sit over 150 guests with both indoor and outdoor seating. Delirium Cafe´is known internationally for its beer selections, but it was important to Mr. Allred and his management team to strike a balance between offering world renowned beers and beers from local breweries. In addi-tion to providing customers with a wide array of beverage selections, Delirium Cafe´will also offer catering services, lease space for private events, and sell a variety of merchandise. Mr. Speaker, I would ask that my colleagues rise and join me in applauding the Grand Opening of Delirium Cafe´. Not only am I ex-cited for the experiences and memories it will afford my constituents, but as the only location in the United States, I look forward to the visi-tors that will be drawn to downtown Leesburg, a truly vibrant area. I wish Mr. Allred, Ms. Kavaldjian, Mr. Leith, and the entire 50 person staff of Delirium Cafe´all the best moving for-ward and in their future endeavors.

IN RECOGNITION OF PASTOR VIC-TORIA JAMES FOR HER SERVICE ON BEHALF OF THE WASHTENAW COUNTY COMMUNITY 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, May 15, 2017 Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Pastor Victoria James of Ekklesia Fellowship Ministries in Ypsilanti, Michigan. Pastor James has provided spiritual guidance and support to the Ypsilanti community at large. Pastor James works with the Ekklesia Fel-lowship Ministries church in Ypsilanti, which holds religious services every Sunday and also participates in a variety of different com-munity initiatives to support groups and indi-viduals in need. These include the annual Back to School Prayer, which provides backpacks and school supplies to needy chil-dren, as well as an annual community Thanks-giving celebration for members of the con-gregation and surrounding areas. Additionally, Pastor James serves as a member of the Washtenaw Faith Leaders Forum, a county-wide interfaith initiative that mobilizes and speaks out on behalf of justice and equality. She has also been an outspoken advocate of improved community relations with law en-forcement and has worked with other faith leaders and law enforcement officials to ad-dress this and other issues. Collectively, Pas-tor James’ actions have provided critical sup-port to individuals in need throughout Washtenaw County. Pastor James’ work has had a trans-formative effect on the city of Ypsilanti. As a lifelong resident of Ypsilanti and longtime com-munity leader, she has leveraged her deep knowledge of the issues affecting the city and its residents to drive positive change. Ms. James’ role as a counselor of Ekklesia Fellow-ship Youth, a church youth group, under-scores her position is a respected mentor and voice for individuals in need. Her work with Ekklesia Fellowship Ministries has helped transform countless lives, and it is my hope that she continues to play a leading role in the Ypsilanti community in the coming years. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Pastor Victoria James of Ekklesia Fellowship Ministries for her work on behalf of Washtenaw County. Pastor James has been key to the growth and development of Ypsi-lanti and the surrounding areas. f 
IN RECOGNITION OF THE HONORABLE JOE MAY 
HON. BARBARA COMSTOCK 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, May 15, 2017 Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to recognize the Honorable Joe May, my friend and former colleague from the House of Delegates of the Virginia General Assembly. Delegate May has had both an il-lustrious business career, in which he has served as the Founder, Chief Technology Offi-cer, and Chairman of the Board of Directors of Electronic Instrumentation and Technology (EIT), and a distinguished career as a public servant as he honorably and capably rep-resented the people of Virginia’s 33rd House District for two decades. Delegate May has dedicated most of his life serving the people of Virginia, starting with his service in the United States military. After-wards, Delegate May became a professional engineer and has since excelled in the field of electrical engineering, as he obtained 24 pat-ents for a variety of inventions, including, among others, a signature reproduction ma-chine, an instrument to measure the curvature of railroad tracks, and the instrument used for measuring octane on gasoline. Then in 1977, soon after he relocated to Loudoun County, Delegate May and his wife, Bobby, founded Electronic Instrumentation and Technology (EIT), which provides electronic manufacturing and engineering services for the medical, communications, industrial process control and analytical instrument markets. EIT would later evolve into a multi-million-dollar company and has been instrumental to the development and success of Loudoun County’s economy during a period when the county’s economy has flourished. In 1993, the year that would mark the ad-vent of his political career, Delegate May was first elected to the House of Delegates from Virginia’s 33rd District, which at the time in-cluded parts of Clarke, Fairfax, Fauquier, and Loudoun counties. In the House of Delegates, Delegate May’s sharp business acumen and unique experience as only one a few profes-sional engineers in the entire General Assem-bly, enabled him to play an integral role in passing numerous legislative initiates, includ-ing a bill to establish the House’s Science and Technology Committee, of which he would later serve as chair. Through his time as Chair of both the Joint Commission on Technology and Science and the Science and Technology Committee, Delegate May helped promote leg-islation that allowed Loudoun County to be-come a leading innovator in the technology sector while also ensuring that western Loudoun retained its bucolic character. For Delegate May’s innumerable contribu-tions in both his career as an entrepreneur and public servant, a remarkable number of well-deserved accolades and honors have been bestowed upon him, including being in-ducted into Virginia Tech’s College of Engi-neering Academy of Engineering Excellence, being named the Loudoun Times-Mirror’s Per-son of the Year for 2012, and being recog-nized as the Legislator of the Year by multiple associations, such as the Virginia Soil, Water and Conversation Districts, the Virginia Cable and Telecommunications Association, and the Virginia Biotechnology Association and Vir-ginia Transit. Delegate May is the true embod-iment of a public servant, and the residents of Virginia will benefit for years to come from his lifetime of service to the Commonwealth. It is honor to call him a friend and I wish him all the best as he continues his focus on the de-velopment and expansion of EIT and on what-ever future endeavors he may pursue.

RECOGNIZING MR. ROBERT ‘‘BOB’’ MAXWELL 
HON. GREG WALDEN 
OF OREGON  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, May 15, 2017 Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recog-nize Mr. Robert ‘‘Bob’’ Maxwell of Bend, Or-egon for his outstanding military and civilian service to Oregon and our nation. Mr. Maxwell is well known in veterans cir-cles mostly as a WWII Medal of Honor recipi-ent. He served with the famed 3rd Infantry Di-vision in North Africa, Sicily, Italy and France. During the invasion of Anzio, Italy, he was wounded and acted bravely to earn his first Silver Star and Purple Heart. Shortly after being released from the Army hospital in Naples, he participated in ‘‘Operation Dra-goon’’—the invasion of Southern France dur-ing late August, 1944. While protecting his Battalion Headquarters with 3 other soldiers in Besancon, France on September 7, 1944, a German Infantry unit outnumbering his unit 10 to 1 attacked the outpost. Mr. Maxwell hurled his unprotected body on a German hand gre-nade thrown into their midst. The grenade ex-ploded under Mr. Maxwell, saving the lives of 3 comrades and severely wounding Mr. Max-well. For his unhesitating valor above and be-yond the call of duty, he was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor, a second Sil-ver Star, a second Purple Heart, a Bronze Star and French Croix de Guerre. Mr. Maxwell was discharged from the U.S. Army and used the ‘‘GI Bill’’ to earn his cre-dentials in Automotive Technology. He worked in that profession for 32 years, teaching at Bend High School, Central Oregon College and Lane Community College. In 1970, he was named one of 5,000 outstanding edu-cators in our nation. Since his retirement from teaching, ‘‘Bob’’ has served as a Director of the Bend Heroes Foundation, and has co-chaired several vet-erans projects including the Bend Parade of Flags, Bend Heroes Memorial, the first-of-its- kind WWII Veterans Historic Highway, and the Oregon Medal of Honor Exhibit. Mr. Maxwell is a passionate promoter of the Congressional Medal of Honor Foundation’s ‘‘Character Development Program’’ now being adopted in Central Oregon schools. As de-voted Christians and proponents of higher education, Mr. Maxwell and his late wife Bea initiated the Bob and Bea Maxwell Medal of Honor Scholarship program at Boise Bible College many years ago. Mr. Maxwell celebrated his 96th birthday on October 26, 2016. He is the oldest surviving recipient of the Medal of Honor, our nation’s highest military award. It has been my privi-lege and honor to know and have worked with Bob Maxwell for many years. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of a grateful state and country, I wish to honor Mr. Robert D. ‘‘Bob’’ Maxwell for his grand accomplishments over many years. IN RECOGNITION OF MARGARET CRAWFORD FOR HER PIO-NEERING CAREER WITH LINCOLN CONSOLIDATED SCHOOLS HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, May 15, 2017 Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Margaret Crawford for her out-standing career with Lincoln Consolidated Schools. As school board member and presi-dent for Lincoln Schools, Ms. Crawford worked tirelessly on behalf of the school district’s stu-dents and staff. After graduating from Wayne State Univer-sity with a degree in Social Work, Ms. Crawford began her career doing case man-agement work for the State of Michigan, even-tually transitioning to work in fiscal manage-ment for Head Start. She then utilized her management and community service experi-ence to successfully run for a seat on the school board of Lincoln Consolidated Schools. During her time on the school board, Ms. Crawford established a reputation as an effec-tive advocate for the district’s students. As a result of her successes, Ms. Crawford was elected school board president of Lincoln Con-solidated Schools, making her the first female and black president in the schools’ history. Ad-ditionally, Ms. Crawford later started the non-profit Council for Black Student Achievement, which provided academic assistance and fi-nancial support to individuals in need. These initiatives played a critical role in providing impactful aid to the district’s students. Ms. Crawford’s work with Lincoln Consoli-dated Schools and in the community has helped empower countless students and im-prove educational outcomes. In addition to her work with the local school system, Ms. Crawford also partnered with local social and community agencies to support efforts to bet-ter serve children in the school district. Her ex-emplary public service and activism have left a lasting legacy in the community, and it is my hope that Lincoln Consolidated Schools can continue to build on these successes. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Margaret Crawford for her work on behalf of Lincoln Consolidated Schools. Ms. Crawford’s trailblazing career has improved the lives of countless students.

Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize an extraordinary leader, Karen Cleveland, for the incredible impact she has had on individuals, families, and communities in Northern Virginia and to congratulate her on being named Northern Virginia Family Serv-ice’s 2017 Community Champion, Ms. Cleveland’s father, Jim Kelly, was a coach and Athletic Director at the University of Cincinnati, and she and her family not only had a strong grasp for health and wellness, but also for working with others. Accordingly, after graduating from the University of Cin-cinnati in 1978, Ms. Cleveland began her ca-reer in Fairfax County teaching aerobics. She knew she wanted to engage with her commu-nity, which is why she took an executive posi-tion in the Fairfax County Chamber of Com-merce in 1986. She then had the opportunity, in 1988, to serve as the first Executive Direc-tor for Greater Reston Chamber of Commerce, which at the time was a start-up chamber that needed tremendous leadership to grow. At the chamber, she worked to establish business and community relationships, and her efforts included starting initiatives to host awards ceremonies, fundraisers, and more. Addition-ally, she then went on to serve as the execu-tive vice president of the Association of Sales and Marketing Companies and as the presi-dent and CEO of Habitat for Humanity of Northern Virginia. In 2008, Ms. Cleveland received a certificate in leadership coaching from Georgetown Uni-versity and then started the Cleveland Coach-ing Group. As a Leadership Coach, she works with executives and emerging leaders to assist them with their personal growth and develop-ment. Now as the president and CEO of Lead-ership Fairfax, Inc., a community leadership development organization, Ms. Cleveland’s ex-pertise has allowed her to empower other indi-viduals and organizations to expand their busi-nesses and explore new opportunities. She has received numerous impressive awards, in-cluding being named the YMCA of Metropoli-tan DC Volunteer of the Year, receiving the EXCEL Award for Nonprofit Leadership Excel-lence by the Center for Nonprofit Advance-ment, and more. Ms. Cleveland’s dedication to improving and preserving businesses and leaders is evident through her illustrious career of dedication and impressive accomplishments.
