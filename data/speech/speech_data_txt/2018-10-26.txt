PRAYER Chaplain David L. Mansberger, U.S. Air Force, Arlington Cemetery, Arling-ton, Virginia, offered the following prayer: Thank You for this day, O God of our Founders, in whose name this Republic was born. We pray that by Your help we may be worthy to receive Your blessings upon our labors today. In the troubled and uneasy travail in this world before the dawn of lasting peace, when men and women of this world have often made deceit a habit, lying an art, and cruelty a science, em-power us to show the better ethic and the moral superiority of the way of life we cherish. Here in this room may ev-eryone see truth upheld, honesty loved, and kindness practiced. In our dealings with each other, may we be gentle, understanding, and kind, with our tempers under control. In our dealings with other nations, may we be firm without obstinacy, generous without extravagance, and right without compromise. We do not pray that other nations may love us, but that they may know that we stand united for what is right, unafraid, with the courage of our convictions. May our private lives and our public actions be consistent with our prayers. Through Your strong, holy, and right-eous name I pray. Amen. f

60TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE IZAAK WALTON LEAGUE–PORTER COUN-TY CHAPTER 
HON. PETER J. VISCLOSKY 
OF INDIANA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 26, 2018 Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, it is with great respect that I take the time to recognize the Izaak Walton League–Porter County Chapter (IWL–PCC) as the organization cele-brates its 60th anniversary. In honor of this special occasion, the IWL–PCC will host a celebratory reception at the Portage Lakefront Park and Riverwalk on October 28, 2018. The IWL–PCC is a not-for-profit organization located in Chesterton, Indiana, and serves as one of Northwest Indiana’s greatest assets. The organization holds steadfast to its mission to conserve, maintain, protect, and restore the soil, forest, water, and other natural resources of the United States and other lands. These efforts have successfully led to the promotion and expansion of opportunities for education of the public on these resources and their en-joyment and wholesome utilization. Organized by my good friends Herb and Charlotte Read in 1958, the IWL–PCC was established to help create the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore, which has grown into an incredible national treasure consisting of 15,000 acres. Tom Dustin of the Fort Wayne Chapter and the late Joe Penfold, former Izaak Walton League of America Conservation Director, also played critical roles in the devel-opment and early success of the Porter Coun-ty Chapter. One of the Chapter’s most important projects is its Family Nature Nights program where local schools are introduced to con-servation and responsible outdoor recreation. Among their many contributions and achieve-ments, the Porter County Chapter is respon-sible for the acquiring of several properties for conservation and preservation, including the Frame Little Calumet Conservation Area, the Carol Cook Wetland Overlook, and the Massauga Creek Unit of the Little Calumet Conservation Area. Additionally, the organiza-tion’s partnership with the Save the Dunes Council, as well as the state and national of-fices of the Izaak Walton League, have played an instrumental role in the commendable suc-cess of the IWL–PCC. As a member of the Chapter for over a dec-ade, it gives me great pleasure to mention some of the inspiring leaders of the organiza-tion who have worked tirelessly to advocate for the conservation of natural resources. They include President Gary Brown, Vice President Jim Sweeney, Secretary Susan Swarner, Treasurer Liz McCloskey, Board members Don Frame and Bill Iltzche, and Executive Di-rector Annette Hansen. I am also grateful for outstanding members such as Walt Breitinger, Bonnie Swarner, the late Terry McCloskey, and the gracious volunteers of the IWL–PCC. Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring and congratulating the Izaak Walton League– Porter County Chapter on its 60th anniversary. For the past 60 years, the Chapter’s leader-ship, office holders, and volunteers have en-hanced Northwest Indiana for generations to come. f

Mr. Speaker, today I rise to talk about a looming menace to our democ-racy that has been pushed off the front pages but that, nevertheless, continues to com-promise our individual liberty and freedom ev-eryday—Mr. Speaker, I am talking about the ongoing erosion of our basic right to privacy guaranteed under the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution. The Fourth Amendment, as a quick re-minder, guarantees: ‘‘The right of people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, and shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particu-larly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.’’ From NSA spying, governmental intrusion into your medical history, to Patriot Act searches of your phone and voice records, to Google collecting data about your everyday life and then turning it over to the highest bid-der OR the government if they want it—our Fourth Amendment rights are under continued attack. The Fourth Amendment is a citizen’s great-est strength to combat a bullying and growing governmental police state. We even have seen an expansion of administrative sub-poenas—somehow my colleagues on the other side of the aisle do not see this as a problem. Why? Because it means that govern-ment bureaucrats, without a judge’s approval or probable cause, can lead lawless investiga-tions fishing for wrong-doing without purpose. This tool has been used against businesses, large and small, as well as individual citizens. The previous administration used the SEC, Department of Justice, and the IRS to target those who seemed ‘‘a bit too conservative’’ or whose purpose aided right-leaning causes. These administrative subpoenas were cre-ated back in the day of FDR and the Great Depression to thwart those who fought back against the New Deal’s major expansion of the federal government and its powers or dared to try to forward free commerce—pay no mind to the forgotten Tenth Amendment. The Found-ing Fathers abhorred these warrants, also called Writs of Assistance, which were used by the British government to target govern-mental critics, those seeking religious free-dom, a free press, merchants and businesses, or those seeking to better their own lives in the new colonies. The Writs allowed British of-ficials to search or seize any property at any-time, anywhere, for any reason. The Fourth Amendment protects against government totalitarianism and government over-reach. Whether it is by governmental snooping of our data and phone records, which has been around since the days of J. Edgar Hoover, and has been amped up in a post 9/11 world, or through judge-less war-rants like administrative subpoenas, Ameri-cans must be on-alert to try to protect what the Fourth Amendment guarantees us all. Be-cause if not, we simply slip back towards a people controlled by our government who is always watching, waiting to grow its power, and listening for that with which it may not agree, a destruction of the amazing democ-racy that was created almost 250 years ago. And that’s just the way it is.

HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 26, 2018 Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Jackie Sillman as a woman of the year. She is a pillar in the community known for her advocacy on behalf of recycling and or-ganic programs in her community. As a Public Relations Manager for Yuba-Sutter Recology, Ms. Sillman educates community organiza-tions, business associations, and school class-es on topics related to recycling. She devel-oped and implemented the Yuba-Sutter curbside recycling program in 2001 and went on to create a website in 2012 which helps in-dividuals understand how to recycle more and move closer to their sustainability goals. Ms. Sillman is an integral part of the Yuba-Sutter Recology team. Outside of work, she is de-voted to helping others fundraise for various organizations and causes. Her efforts include helping to raise funds for grad nights, week- long environmental camps, hospital founda-tions, and local organizations, including Pink October, Relay for Life, LEAD Yuba-Sutter, the Alzheimer’s Foundation, and countless other causes. Ms. Sillman is a past President of the Soroptimist International in Yuba-Sutter and is currently the Chair of the Sierra-Nevada Regional Development Retreat.

CELEBRATING THE MILITARY SERVICE OF BILL ANTONE 
HON. BRIAN BABIN 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 26, 2018 Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank a great man for his military service, Wil-liam D. ‘‘Bill’’ Antone. Mr. Antone is a one hundred year old World War II veteran of the United States Army. Bill Antone was born on August 23, 1918, in Clarksdale, Mississippi, two and a half months before the end of World War I. Bill is the last remaining of his four siblings. Bill moved to Houston in 1929 where he attended Harris El-ementary on Broadway at Manchester, Deedee Junior High School, and Sam Hous-ton High School. During the depression in 1932, the family moved to Bryan, Texas where Bill graduated in May, 1935. Bill married Ammye Boggs on April 29, 1939. On October 29, 1937, Bill applied and was hired by Shell Refinery in Deer Park. In April 1944 Mr. Antone was drafted into the United States Army and served in the In-fantry. He was stationed at Fort Sam Houston and Camp Fannin in Tyler, Texas and was as-signed as company clerk of Company A 59, 12th Regiment. Eventually, the Army sent Bill to Washington and Lee University in Lex-ington, Virginia. After returning to Camp Fannin, the war ended and Camp Fannin was shut down. Bill was transferred to Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas where he was discharged from the Army in May 1946. Following his discharge from the Army in May 1946, Mr. Antone returned to Shell Deer Park where he worked for over thirty-eight years. Bill and Ammye are parents to three children, five grandchildren, and many great grandchildren. Ammye went to be with the Lord on September 10, 2004. Bill was later blessed with eleven years of marriage to Jocelyn M. Williams-Antone who passed in 2017. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Antone for his self-less military service to this great nation.

HONORING THE 6TH CONGRES-SIONAL DISTRICT MILITARY SERVICE ACADEMY NOMINATION BOARD 
HON. LUKE MESSER 
OF INDIANA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 26, 2018 Mr. MESSER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the individuals who served on our 6th Congressional District Military Service Acad-emy Nomination Board. As a Member of Congress, I have the honor of nominating young Hoosiers from Indiana’s 6th Congressional District to the United States Military Service Academies. Each Member of Congress may nominate up to ten candidates for each available vacancy to the Military Academy at West Point, the Naval Academy, the Air Force Academy, and the Merchant Ma-rine Academy. Each year, the members of the 6th Con-gressional District Military Service Academy Nomination Board work with my staff and I to evaluate the applications of young men and women from our District who are seeking ad-mittance to a military academy. During my time in Congress, we have nominated more than 90 young men and women to these academies. Many of them have since grad-uated and are currently serving our country. I want to thank all of the members of the Nomination Board, including, Nate LaMar, Jan Frazier, Robert Morrow, David Martin, and Kelly Poltrack for their service. The Board’s in-sight and experience has always been helpful to me and my staff. I appreciate their service on the Committee and their dedication to our country. I wish all of them continued success in whatever God has in store for them and their families. f 
TRIBUTE TO DOUGLASS BELLIS 
HON. BOB GOODLATTE 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 26, 2018 Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, today, I recognize Douglass Bellis, Senior Counsel at the Office of Legislative Counsel, U.S. House of Representatives. Doug passed on Monday, October 15, 2018. He was born in Penn Yan, New York, on March 25, 1947. He graduated with Honors from Cornell University in 1968 with a double major in Government and Greek and Latin Classics, Language and Literature, and re-ceived his Juris Doctor degree from the Duke University School of Law in 1971. Since then, Doug worked at the Office of Legislative Counsel, U.S. House of Representatives, in Washington, D.C., rising from Assistant Coun-sel to Deputy Legislative Counsel and then Senior Counsel. He was universally recog-nized by legislative experts for his intellectually rigorous approach to legislative drafting and for his encyclopedic knowledge of court cases related to the Congress and its powers. For almost 30 years, Doug also served as advisor to the Commonwealth Association of Legislative Counsel, consulting with foreign parliamentary bodies regarding the strength-ening of their parliamentary institutions in the context of increased democratic participation in government. Since 2008, Doug also served as an Adjunct Professor at George Wash-ington University. Throughout his life, he pur-sued his passionate intellectual curiosity about science, religion, philosophy, law, history and music. Doug is survived by his beloved wife Suzanne Bellis, his brother Vincent Bellis (wife Ann), his daughters Margaret English and Eliz-abeth Wolfe, Andrew English, Matthew English and Bradley English, and six grandchildren. Among too many achievements to recount, Doug was responsible for codifying Title 11 of the U.S. Code consisting of the nation’s bank-ruptcy laws, the first and only title of the U.S. Code not to originate in or go through the Law Revision Counsel’s Office. Doug also worked extensively on the Federal Rules of Evidence and drafted numerous bills amending, restruc-turing, and improving the criminal statutes of the United States, including an ambitious, multi-year project to overhaul the federal crimi-nal code. He drafted many articles of im-peachment. Doug trained many counsels at the House Office of Legislative Counsel as well as countless Committee staff. As Judge Robert A. Katzmann, Chief Judge U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit wrote, Doug ‘‘was a firm believer in the impor-tance of dialogue between the courts and Congress, someone who believed that with improved communication, understanding and proper care, that government could be made to work better.’’ Judge Katzmann came to know Doug through their work on a Govern-ance Institute project whereby statutory opin-ions of the courts of appeals, identifying issues of possible interest to Congress, were sent to Congress for its information and con-sideration. Doug was a champion for the project for the last quarter century and he out-lined his views in an essay published in 1997 in the Georgetown Law Journal entitled ‘‘A View from the House of Representatives.’’ In 2008, Doug wrote an article on Congressional drafting conventions for the Federal Judicial Center entitled ‘‘Statutory Structure and Legis-lative Drafting Conventions: A Primer for Judges,’’ a guide to be used by judges for clarification of intent, which is still used today. In 2011, Doug authored ‘‘The Role and Effi-cacy of Legislative Drafting in the United States: An Update on the American Drafting Process’’ for the Commonwealth Association of Legislative Counsel. In it, he wrote ‘‘Like the classic Puritan, the legislative counsel must be in this world, that is the world of politics, and yet not of it, in order to be effective. . . . So the legislative counsel is outside of the polit-ical process, and as scrupulously neutral as humanly possible, yet acutely aware of the po-litical concerns of the politicians the legislative counsel works with.’’ Doug, describing the more day-to-day de-tails of his professional role, wrote a few years ago, ‘‘With the Judiciary Committee, I contin-ued to do criminal law and procedure and civil procedure, bankruptcy, civil and constitutional rights (including various hot button topics like abortion and guns), judgeships, some grant programs, and a miscellany of things like reso-lutions of inquiry and committee subpoenas . . . I also had the Railroad Retirement and Railroad Unemployment acts, which were under the jurisdiction of the Commerce Com-mittee and were heating up, leading eventually to a total rewrite of the Railroad Retirement Act and the addition of a somewhat complex experience rating scheme for ‘contributions’ under the Railroad Unemployment Act. I worked on a number of Voting Rights bill ex-tensions and other civil rights matters starting in the mid to late 70’s.’’ For decades, Doug worked with, or was fa-miliar to, virtually the entire House Judiciary Committee staff, many of whom he could count as friends. Paul Taylor, the Chief Coun-sel of the House Subcommittee on the Con-stitution and Civil Justice, said the following of Doug: ‘‘In his career, Doug was a spirited polymath. He had an opinion on everything, and it was an educated opinion. He was fluent in history, philosophy, law, and religion. He was a master of grammar who knew how to corral the most unwieldy legal concepts in the clearest and most concise terms. Doug worked wonderfully with a wide range of per-sonalities. His calm, professorial manner was a solid rudder that kept the text of legislation on technical course through all manner of seas and crew. In his friendships, Doug was a consummate host, serving time-tested ad-vice and ideas along with classic cocktails at

his wonderful dinners, which were more like Enlightenment-inspired salons. When he spoke of life, he often used the examples of his wonderful children who have led such ec-lectic lives, and of his loving wife Suzanne, a gifted and celebrated nurse whose devoted care so eased his passing. And when he spoke of law, he cited Samuel von Pufendorf as much as John Marshall. He was familiar with legal giants who may be unfamiliar to many today, but whose legal principles breathe life into law. And Doug loved the law. He understood its history and structure, and its role in shaping the duties of both legislators drafting statutes and citizens living under them. He kept with him the spirit that gov-erned when he first joined the House Legisla-tive Counsel’s Office, a time when legislative counsels worked more directly with Members, away from the cameras, to engage in robust debates that plumbed fathoms deeper and miles wider than today’s media often allows.’’ Doug lived a full, appreciative life, with the understanding that the good life is a moral one. He was also a devout poet. He penned these lines, which were printed for his memo-rial service: 
What good God gives to us we dimly know While guile besets our fates and tempests brood While ignorance still reigns and harsh winds blow; Where envy breeds in brackish waters’ flood, We sink beneath the waves and gasp for air. Yet unseen pipers dart upon the sand, And still bright Sun illuminates Ocean’s lair And bold strong waves still seek th’untested land. For grace that knows no limits us pursues, And gathers us within God’s loving arms, Surprises us with what we cannot lose, And brings us strange but not uncertain charms. What love God has for us we can but feel, So too our love by loving prints its seal. —Douglass Bellis 
It is with the utmost respect, and on behalf of generations of committee Members and staff, that we include in the R
ECORD this trib- ute in memory of Douglass Bellis.

HONORING KIWANIS GOVERNOR JOHN ‘‘HANK’’ BAKER AND FIRST LADY BONNIE BAKER 
HON. JOHN KATKO 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 26, 2018 Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Kiwanis Governor John ‘‘Hank’’ Baker and his wife, First Lady Bonnie Baker. During their leadership tenures, Governor and First Lady Baker have upheld Kiwanis Inter-national’s mission of improving the lives of un-derserved children and adults throughout New York state. Kiwanis International is an organization committed to serving underprivileged children and adults throughout the world. As they con-duct their service projects, Kiwanis focuses on fighting hunger, teaching verbal and written communication, and setting children on a path to success. Governor and First Lady Baker have spearheaded many such initiatives dur-ing their Kiwanis careers. As Governor, Mr. Baker has championed the participation of military children at Kamp Kiawanis in Taberg, NY. At Kamp Kiawanis, children are presented the opportunity to par-ticipate in a variety of outdoor activities, as well as learn the qualities of leadership and fairness. Additionally, Governor Baker has opened two Aktion Clubs, which aim to teach individuals with disabilities the skills necessary to succeed. During her current tenure as First Lady, Ms. Baker has established a supply drive called Krafts for Kamp. Under the First Lady’s lead-ership, volunteers will be working with all New York Kiwanis districts to secure the supplies needed to support Kamp Kiawanis arts and crafts activities next year. First Lady Baker has long been active in Kiwanis, serving as Lieutenant Governor of the Niagara Frontier division prior to becoming First Lady. Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues in the House join me in recognizing John and Bonnie Baker’s contributions to the New York District of Kiawanis. Their commitment to serving indi-viduals in need and passion for philanthropy is a standard all should look up to. I applaud their efforts in New York, as well as the work of Kiwanis International throughout the world. f 
HONORING THE 70TH BIRTHDAY OF PAT POPRIK 
HON. BRIAN K. FITZPATRICK 
OF PENNSYLVANIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 26, 2018 Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I’m proud to recognize a dear friend, trusted partner, and community icon who is celebrating her 70th birthday this month. Pat Poprik continues to work tirelessly to im-prove the lives of all Bucks County residents. For decades, she championed the virtues of limited government, individual freedom, and liberty for all people of this great nation. For the past four decades, Pat has provided wisdom and mentorship for Pennsylvania Re-publicans, rising to become the party’s state treasurer. Her work culminated in her current position as chairwoman of the Bucks County Republican Party, where her deep under-standing of local issues and community con-cerns has delivered lasting, positive results for our community. It is hard to name anyone who works harder or is more connected to Bucks County than Pat. On behalf of a grateful, civic minded com-munity, I wish Pat a very happy birthday.

RECOGNIZING CHIEF ERWIN ROY OLNEY 
HON. RICK LARSEN 
OF WASHINGTON  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 26, 2018 Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the distinguished life and dis-tinguished career of 100-year-old Chief Erwin Roy Olney of Burlington, Washington. Chief Olney is a World War II and Korean War U.S. Navy veteran who served in Dutch Harbor, Alaska; Honolulu; and New York City. He enlisted at 17 on August 4, 1936. He was discharged in October 1941, but re-en-listed in December, 1941, after the attack on Pearl Harbor. While in Dutch Harbor, he shot down a Jap-anese Zero fighter plane. The recovered plane helped U.S. engineers understand their enemy and improve U.S. fighters at a critical time in the war. Chief Olney retired in 1956 with more than 20 years of service. His rank at retirement was Chief Aviation Machinist Mate. On October 11, 2018, Chief Olney turned 100 years old. He is a patriot and deserves to be honored not just for this milestone birthday but also for his commitment to this country. During the month of his 100th birthday, I rise to recognize and thank Chief Olney. f

HONORING JOANNE SANTANDREA WITH CALIFORNIA’S THIRD DIS-TRICT WOMAN OF THE YEAR AWARD 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 26, 2018 Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Joanne Santandrea as a woman of the year. She has always taken it upon herself to be there when others need it most. As a ra-diology technologist at Adventist Health Clearlake, she is a committed healthcare pro-fessional always focused on the wellbeing of her patients. When fires have torn through her community, she has been on the front lines of ensuring that those affected receive proper medical care and supplies. Whether it’s been the Valley Fire, Ranch Fire, or Pawnee Fire, she has gone above and beyond to meet all the pressing challenges and desperate needs that arise. An active member, secretary, and treasurer for the Clearlake Oaks Women of the Moose, Chapter 1691, she has been an indispensable resource for the organization. Whether changing dressings and checking vital signs, arranging for a truckload of food to be delivered to Lake County from her former church, or making hundreds of dinners for evacuees, Ms. Santandrea demonstrates her compassion and generosity daily. Her engag-ing personality and commitment to profes-sionalism enable her to bridge divides and af-fect positive change in the lives of those she seeks to serve. Others are quick to note that she is amongst the most generous, caring, and helpful of people that they have had the pleasure of knowing. Ms. Santandrea is a true

RECOGNIZING THE 90TH ANNIVER-SARY OF ST. RICHARD PARISH IN CHICAGO 
HON. DANIEL LIPINSKI 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 26, 2018 Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 90th anniversary of St. Richard Par-ish in Chicago. On Sunday, October 28, the church will hold a celebration to commemorate nearly a century of faith and service to the community, and I am pleased that I will be joining them. St. Richard Parish has a long and thriving history, dating back to the 1920s. As the Ar-cher Heights community grew, George Car-dinal Mundelein of the Archdiocese of Chicago recognized the need for a new Catholic parish in the area and established St. Richard on June 8, 1928. While services were temporarily held in a storefront on 51st Street, the men from the parish banded together and built their first church. This endeavor required hard work, commitment, and sincerity, all unifying charac-teristics of the church’s parishioners. Fr. Ed-ward Kilroy became pastor in 1944, and dur-ing his 22 years leading the parish he oversaw significant growth. In 1947 the St. Richard Parish School was opened, giving the children of Archer Heights an opportunity for an out-standing Catholic education and chance to better themselves spiritually and intellectually. As the parish grew, a new church was con-structed in 1959 on the comer of Kastner Ave-nue and 50th Street. In the first decade of the 21st century, under the leadership of Fr. Thomas Bernas, a community center was added by the parish. I’m proud to have been able to help with the funding for that project which helps the parish serve the Archer Heights community. From their first pastor, Rev. Horace Wellman, to their current pastor, Fr. Krzysztof Janczak, St. Richard’s diverse group of parish-ioners continue to enrich the community with outreach programs, a strong school, and an unwavering commitment to their faith in Jesus Christ. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring St. Richard Parish and its parish-ioners on the parish’s 90th anniversary. I am proud to have in the Third District of Illinois such a vibrant example of the values that can be provided by a church with outstanding leadership and committed parishioners.

IN RECOGNITION OF MR. GEORGE GUASTELLO AND HIS 10-YEAR ANNIVERSARY AS PRESIDENT AND CEO OF UNION STATION KANSAS CITY 
HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER 
OF MISSOURI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 26, 2018 Mr. CLEAVER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. George Guastello’s 10-year an-niversary as the President and Chief Execu-tive Officer of Union Station Kansas City and to celebrate his countless contributions to Kansas City’s rich history and vibrant culture. It is an honor to commemorate his profound career with this Congressional Record. As a lifetime Kansas City resident, George Guastello keeps close ties to his neighborhood and continues to be a pillar of the community through his role as President and CEO of Union Station Kansas City. Although Mr. Guastello has fulfilled the duties of his role for a decade, his devotion to the Kansas City area far exceeds this single role. Mr. Guastello has an unremitting dedication to the revitaliza-tion of the city and continues to serve as an agent of change in its growth. Mr. Guastello spearheaded the reopening of Union Station Kansas City in 1999, following years of neglect. Once dormant, Union Station is now one of the city’s most beloved and well-known landmarks. Union Station has be-come a crown jewel of our great city, visited not only by locals, but by tourists from all over the world. Mr. Guastello’s hard work to high-light the historic fabric of Kansas City through the preservation of Union Station continues to unite Kansas Citians and visitors beyond city limits. It connects individuals from across the country with innovative exhibits, significant his-torical background, and engaging educational experiences. As we navigate through an everchanging society, the importance of pre-serving aspects of our history becomes in-creasingly more relevant and vital to ensuring the generations to come have an opportunity to reflect on history while shaping their own. The grand reopening of Union Station Kansas City ensured that a significant piece of Kansas City’s history would not become a faint mem-ory, but, instead, would transcend time for generations to come. Moreover, Mr. Guastello’s work regarding Union Station is but one of many achieve-ments he has championed. Mr. Guastello’s role as President and CEO for the American Royal Association highlighted our region’s lush agricultural heritage. In addition, as the Vice President of Marketing and Business Strategy for Starlight Theater, Mr. Guastello shined a spotlight on innovation and helped the com-pany achieve an all-time high season attend-ance of over a quarter million people. While these are only a few of Mr. Guastello’s many accomplishments, they speak volumes to not only the commitment Mr. Guastello makes to the greater Kansas City community, but also to his meritorious character. IT is a privilege to stand today and recog-nize the work of Mr. Guastello. Mr. Speaker, please join me in honoring Mr. George Guastello’s remarkable career and service to the people of the greater Kansas City area. I look forward to seeing the work and contribu-tions of Mr. Guastello continue to shape and advance the greater Kansas City Community. f 
WILLIAM ‘‘BILL’’ COORS 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 26, 2018 Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of William ‘‘Bill’’ Coors who passed away peacefully last week at the age of 102. Bill served as the chairman of what became the Coors Brewing Company from 1959 until 2000, and he continued serv-ing as an official beer taster for Coors until his 100th birthday. Through Bill’s decades of service to the Brewery, he was involved in much of the growth in the beer industry in America. One of his biggest accomplishments was his develop-ment of the aluminum can. Before 1959, Americans drank beer out of a tin-lined steel container. Not only was this practice extremely wasteful, but the lining affected the flavor of the beer. Bill realized aluminum would be a better container because it is 100 percent re-cyclable, it would be less expensive to trans-port, and wouldn’t affect the taste of the beer. Bill’s push to use the aluminum can and mod-ernize the canning assembly line almost 60 years ago had a lasting impact on the entire industry. More importantly, Bill was a close family friend who worked with my father Leonard Perlmutter over the years. The two enjoyed a great friendship which spread to the rest of our families. I will always remember Bill as a fantastic piano player, as he would often play the piano beautifully at parties I attended. He was also involved in many community organi-zations throughout Colorado. I want to thank Bill for his years of friend-ship and recognize his tremendous contribu-tions to the Coors Brewing Company over the years. f 
HONORING WILLIAM J. ‘‘HANK’’ ‘‘SKIPPY’’ MILLER OF SOUTH BOSTON, MA AND QUINCY, MA 
HON. STEPHEN F. LYNCH 
OF MASSACHUSETTS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 26, 2018 Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of William J. ‘‘Hank’’ ‘‘Skippy’’ Miller and to recognize his out-standing contributions to his hometowns of South Boston and Quincy, Massachusetts, and to his over forty years of loyal service to the International Longshoreman’s Association in Massachusetts and the labor movement of the United States of America. Mr. Speaker, Skippy Miller’s life was dedi-cated to his family, his faith, his profession, and his service to the United States Marine Corps. Growing up in South Boston, he devel-oped a strong Catholic faith that he cherished throughout his life. He was a longtime devoted parishioner at Our Lady of Good Voyage Chapel and served proudly as a United States Marine in the Korean War and was the former commander of the Michael J. Perkins Amer-ican Legion Post No. 67 in South Boston. Skippy Miller was a longshoreman by trade and served as the past president of the Inter-national Longshoremen’s Association Local 800. He was a business agent for 18 years and pension administrator from 1993 until 2017. He also served as vice president of the New England Dock and Marine Council. Skippy was the devoted husband of the late Priscilla ‘‘Penny’’ Miller. Together they raised four children: Michele, Michael, Colleen, and Billy; and both were blessed with their grand-children: Casey, Madelyn, Caitlyn, Corey, Loren, Jordan, Viktoria, Makayla, and William.

How fit-ting a tribute to locate this park along the docks and waterfront in honor of a man who worked and fought to make a difference in the daily lives of so many working families.

Mr. Speaker, it is my distinct honor today to join with the family, friends and contem-poraries of William J. ‘‘Hank’’ ‘‘Skippy’’ Miller to honor his remarkable service to his family, his faith, the labor movement, and the United States of America.

IN MEMORY OF JANE LOUISE ‘‘THE MAYOR’’ GLOVER 
HON. JOE COURTNEY 
OF CONNECTICUT  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 26, 2018 Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of Jane Louise Glover who passed away far too soon. She was only 71 years old. Jane, a Nebraska native, made a name for herself in New London, CT. After graduating from Peru State College, she obtained her master’s degree in library science from the University of Rhode Island before beginning her career in service of the city of New Lon-don. Jane got her start as a librarian and media specialist in New London public schools and libraries. Jane eventually went on to be-come president/government relations coordi-nator for the Connecticut Education Associa-tion. Jane, who served five terms on the city council and three on the school board, includ-ing one as president, was elected New Lon-don’s mayor three times by her fellow councilors. In 2007, after a sixteen-year stint in elected public service, Jane attempted to retire and pass the torch of leadership off to the next generation. However, that retirement turned out to be a mere hiatus. In 2011, when New London elected Daryl Justin Finizio as its first permanent mayor in 90 years, Jane was brought back to the helm, this time as the new mayor’s chief administration officer. Mayor Finizio needed someone to show him the ropes, and who better than the woman who had already done the job three times? Jane’s expertise and historical knowledge of city poli-tics was unrivaled. Always proud of New London’s diversity, Jane was also a great advocate of the arts and culture. She served on the board of the Garde Arts Center and was a co-founder of the Kente Cultural Center where she served as executive director. The center worked to fill a gap in the lack of cultural activities for peo-ple of color—specifically children in the geo-graphical area. Jane was also president of the missionary department at Trinity Missionary Baptist Church, assisting those in need of food and shelter. I had the honor of getting to know Jane when she and I served as delegates to the 1988 Democratic National Convention, and we’ve remained friends ever since. Having seen, up close, Jane’s passionate belief in public service and helping others, she had a unique ability to take a pragmatic approach when advocating for people and the commu-nity. She truly understood that the goal of pub-lic service was to get results. Jane was a remarkable woman who wore many hats during her time on this Earth. New London would not be the inclusive community it is today without her energy, dedication, acu-men, and passion. Colleagues, please join me in extending our condolences to Jane’s friends and family as well as the whole New London community, who have lost a beloved trail-blazer and public servant. f 
HONORING THE WEST SHORE FIRE DEPARTMENT ON THE CELEBRA-TION OF ITS CENTENNIAL ANNI-VERSARY 
HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO 
OF CONNECTICUT  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 26, 2018 Ms. D
ELAURO. Mr. Speaker, it is my great pleasure to rise today to extend my heartfelt congratulations to Chief Stephen Scafariello and the members of the West Shore Fire De-partment, past and present, as they mark the 100th Anniversary of the West Shore Fire De-partment. This is a remarkable milestone for this community institution. Before the incorporation of what is now the City of West Haven, a group of twenty neigh-bors gathered together because they shared the desire to protect their families and neigh-borhoods from the dangers of fire. Incor-porated in February of 1918, the West Shore Fire Department was built by and for the neighborhood and continues to be inde-pendent of the City today. In its earliest days, volunteers manned the Department and they relied on a borrowed hand-drawn hose wagon. Today, the West Shore Fire Department has thirty-two active paid firefighters as well as ten active volunteer firefighters. It is through their dedicated efforts that the Department con-tinues to serve and protect the West Shore community. The men and women who serve as fire-fighters face risks that few of us can truly comprehend. Each day, they must be ready to perform under intense pressure—literally in life or death situations. They are an inspiration to us all and yet when asked why you will always hear the same reply: ‘‘It’s my job.’’ For a cen-tury the men and women of the West Shore Fire Department have stood at the ready, pro-viding peace of mind to their neighbors. I can-not thank them enough for their good work and outstanding dedication. Today, as they mark their centennial anni-versary, I am proud to stand and extend my congratulations to all of those who have con-tributed to the success of the West Shore Fire District. In Italian there is a phrase, ‘‘Cent’ Anni’’ which means ‘‘to another hundred!’’ Please accept my deepest thanks and appre-ciation for your service this past hundred years and my very best wishes for many more years of success to come.

HONORING LOU LEONARD 
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 26, 2018 Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a member of the community who this year is being recognized by the Northeast Jewish Center at their annual event, Lou Leonard. Lou was born on May 8, 1955 at Jewish Memorial Hospital in Manhattan. A ‘‘Mother’s Day’’ present for his Mom, he was taken home to East Tremont, in the Bronx. His family moved to the newly-completed Sprain Lake Knolls housing development in northeast Yon-kers, NY in the fall of 1957. There, they dis-covered and joined a new synagogue that was formed to take advantage of the influx of Jew-ish people into Yonkers in the post-WW2 era. Known as Northeast Jewish Center (NEJC), it was at its inception a storefront shul—as Lou remembers it—and his sister began Hebrew School classes at the synagogue located at the Hartman Home for Hebrew Orphans where the new hotel is presently located. Lou’s earliest memories include his father taking him to the Friday night Shabbos serv-ices at the storefront shul and the ‘‘Sunday School’’ in the rear of the sanctuary, when he was five years old. Lou also remembers his Dad taking him to Rosh Hashanah services and the short walk down the block to a build-ing under construction that would eventually become the synagogue’s new home. Lou spent seven years at this Hebrew School that he attended on Sunday and for two additional afternoons each week—after his Public School No. 32 classes were over for the day. Lou’s public schooling included Walt Whit-man Junior High School and Theodore Roo-sevelt High School (Yonkers). Trained in science and mathematics, and having an inter-est in the electronics of the day, he went on to study engineering at Columbia University. Though he left school prematurely, Lou would later return, fortified with a new religious sense of direction and a greater respect for edu-cation. He became the Electrical Engineer he was meant to be and has been in the elec-tronics business for over 40 years. He’s had both fun and aggravation, but throughout his journey, he’ll always tell you he’s grateful to Hashem for the consideration, the blessings, and the learning. That’s why you will see him here at NEJC and other synagogues.

IN RECOGNITION OF MR. MARK M
CHENRY AND HIS 44 YEARS OF DEDICATED SERVICE TO KANSAS CITY 
HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER 
OF MISSOURI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 26, 2018 Mr. CLEAVER. Mr. Speaker, I proudly rise today to recognize and celebrate Mr. Mark McHenry’s 44-year career with the Kansas City Parks and Recreation Department. For over four decades, Mr. McHenry dutifully served the people of Kansas City, fulfilling nu-merous roles and bringing about countless im-provements to public space in the greater Kansas City area. Mr. McHenry began his dis-tinguished career with the Kansas City Parks and Recreation Department removing snow from roadways and sidewalks following snow-fall; a sometimes daunting, but necessary job during the winter months throughout the Mid-west. The same hard work and dedication Mr. McHenry displayed at the start of his time with the department, he has continuously and unremittingly matched and exceeded in the time since. Mr. McHenry’s notable career has warranted many accolades and has contrib-uted to the lives of not only the people of Kan-sas City, but also to the people of Missouri’s Fifth Congressional District and beyond. Most recently, as the Director, Kansas City Parks and Recreation was listed on the Na-tional Register of Historic Places. Included in his many achievements, McHenry’s tenure oversaw the creation of the world War I Mu-seum, the restoration and expansion of the Liberty Memorial and the expansion of the Kansas City Zoo. McHenry rose to the position of Director in 2003, after nearly three decades of dedicated service to the Parks and Recre-ation Department. His remarkable career as the Director reveals his lifelong commitment to the department’s mission: to improve the qual-ity of life, health, and wellness of the commu-nity by providing socially equitable, commu-nity-driven programming, and environmentally sound natural resource management. He has worked relentlessly to uphold the organiza-tion’s mission of providing recreational pro-grams and opportunities for the community while also contributing to an aesthetically pleasing environment and enhanced quality of life. Moreover, the presence of safe spaces for communities to connect, integrate, and share experiences is at the core of any thriving com-munity. Mr. McHenry’s efforts exemplified this. He oversaw the creation of several community centers that serve as indispensable spaces for Kansas City communities to gather and enrich their bodies and minds while enjoying nature and forging stronger communal relationships. It is my personal belief that Mark’s unwaver-ing dedication and steadfast vision has made a profound impact on the Kansas City commu-nity. Therefore, it is with a sense of bittersweet pride that the community must now congratu-late Mark on his retirement. I speak on behalf of the entire city when I say thank you, Mr. Mark McHenry. Mr. Speaker, please join me and all of Mis-souri’s Fifth Congressional District in express-ing our sincerest congratulations to Mark McHenry for his monumental achievements in the community and his tireless efforts in pro-moting environmental conservation, innova-tion, and preservation of parks and rec-reational sites, not only in his city limits, but throughout the state. I urge all my colleagues to join me and Missouri’s 5th District in show-ing our appreciation to Mr. Mark McHenry for his accomplishments and service. f 
HONORING LUCY ROBERTS WITH CALIFORNIA’S THIRD DISTRICT WOMAN OF THE YEAR AWARD 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 26, 2018 Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Lucy Roberts as a woman of the year. She is a tireless advocate for under-served women and families throughout her community. As Director of Family Hui, she leads an organization dedicated to creating healthy, thriving families and communities by providing parents with the support and encour-agement they need to raise their children in a healthy way. She has worked diligently to make a difference in the lives of children by empowering their parents to make the choices that are best for their family. Ms. Roberts is deeply committed to the empowerment of women and providing parents with the tools to help strengthen family bonds. She has made a lasting positive impact on countless families throughout Yolo County. As Co-Chair of Resil-ient Yolo, Ms. Roberts works to educate peo-ple about the impact adverse childhood expe-riences have on shaping adult behavior and health. She also brings her passion and ex-pertise to the Yolo County Maternal Mental Health Collaborative, an organization which promotes maternal wellness by developing a system of care for Yolo County mothers at risk of maternal mental health disorders. The last-ing positive impact Ms. Roberts has had on families throughout Yolo County cannot be overstated.

INTRODUCTION OF THE NATIONAL CAPITAL PLANNING COMMISSION 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 26, 2018 Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today, I intro-duced the National Capital Planning Commis-sion District of Columbia Home Rule Act. This bill would remove the authority of the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC) to re-view or approve the development of District of Columbia-owned land. This bill would also re-move the requirement that the Mayor of the District get NCPC’s approval before selling D.C.-owned real estate, and would allow D.C. agencies to transfer jurisdiction over District- owned land among themselves without NCPC’s approval. Under federal law, the development of Dis-trict-owned public buildings, including the loca-tion, height, bulk, number of stories and size of such buildings, in the ‘‘central area’’ is sub-ject to NCPC approval. The District is required to consult with NCPC on its buildings outside the central area, but NCPC has only advisory authority in those areas. The central area is defined by the concurrent action of NCPC and the D.C. Council, and currently consists of the Downtown and Shaw Urban Renewal Areas. This authority is unnecessary, as shown by the virtual absence of its use to disapprove sales or development. This latent authority of the federal government should not be able to slow or block the development of District- owned land, or add to the cost of develop-ment. The District is not a federal agency and should not be treated any differently by federal law than other local jurisdictions, where local development proceeds without federal inter-ference. NCPC consists of 12 members, three ap-pointed by the President, two appointed by the Mayor, the Mayor, the Chair of the D.C. Coun-cil, the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Defense, the Administrator of General Serv-ices, and the Chairs of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and the House Oversight and Government Re-form Committee. This bill is one more important step to in-crease home rule for the District, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill. f 
CELEBRATING THE WAYNE TOWN-SHIP MEMORIAL FIRST AID SQUAD’S 75TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. RODNEY P. FRELINGHUYSEN 
OF NEW JERSEY  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 26, 2018 Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the Wayne Township Me-morial First Aid Squad located in the Township of Wayne, New Jersey, on the occasion of its 75th Anniversary. Born out of necessity, the Wayne Township Memorial First Aid Squad has grown over the past seven decades to become an efficient, well-operated organization that responds to over five thousand calls each year. Back in 1942, Wayne suffered the loss of eight lives during the bitterly cold week of February 8–14. At that time, there was no local first aid squad, and ambulance services were provided by neighboring units in Pompton Lakes, Little Falls, and Cedar Grove, as well as by Paterson hospitals. Seeing the need to have a squad within the township, a group of con-cerned citizens took it upon themselves to es-tablish a local ambulance corps, which be-came a reality one year later. In 1943, the Wayne Township Memorial First Aid Squad was officially formed, and the first call was responded to on September 1, 1944. The original headquarters was located on Oak Street on the property of Captain Wil-liam Taylor, the first president of the squad. During the early years, Wayne also responded to calls in half of Totowa and all of Lincoln Park, until these communities developed squads of their own. The headquarters moved in 1950 to Boon-ton Road, now Mountainview Boulevard, on a site currently occupied by American Legion Post No. 174 before eventually moving to the

Mountain View building on Taylor Drive. As Wayne Township continued to expand, a sec-ond building was added on Hamburg Turn-pike, giving the township two facilities at oppo-site ends of town. An addition of bay areas to the Hamburg Turnpike facility took place in 1992, and proved to be of great value, espe-cially after fire destroyed the Mountain View building and all equipment had to be moved and stored. The first ambulance for the Wayne squad was a 1942 recycled Buick hearse, which was obtained from Chicago. In 1954, a 1952 Cad-illac became the second ambulance for the corps, and the original Buick was replaced by another Cadillac. The first two rescue vehicles were a Jeep wagon and a Chevrolet truck, which could transport personnel and equip-ment but could not carry patients from an acci-dent site. This problem was solved with the addition of a Multi-Carry Rescue (MCR) vehi-cle in the early 1970’s, and later by a rescue truck with a custom-designed box on a Ford diesel chassis obtained in 1987. The organization that started out with only a handful of people has now grown to over 80 trained Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs). All members receive this type of train-ing, and may also complete courses with the State Police in heavy rescue work. The estab-lishing of the Youth Squad in 1973 allowed youngsters 16 to 18 years of age to serve in an auxiliary capacity, and many went on to be-come members of the squad. Now known as the Cadet Corps, active members are still being sought. The Squad has come a long way in the more than sixty-five years since the original ‘‘hearse’’ responded to its first call. Modern equipment, consisting of five modular ambu-lances and a state of the art rescue truck, highly-trained volunteers, and efficient commu-nication systems, provide Wayne and sur-rounding municipalities and the County of Pas-saic, with the finest service by men and women who give much time and effort to serve others. Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and our col-leagues join me in congratulating the Wayne Township Memorial First Aid Squad, on the occasion of its 75th Anniversary.

IN REMEMBRANCE OF CAPTAIN SIDNEY EDWIN VEAZEY 
HON. ROBERT J. WITTMAN 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 26, 2018 Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in solemn remembrance of the life of Captain Sidney Edwin ‘‘Ed’’ Veazey, a retired Navy veteran, husband, father, and grandfather from King George, Virginia. Ed Veazey admirably served in the U.S. Navy and will be remem-bered for his selfless devotion to his commu-nity. Captain Veazey was born in September 1937 in Wilmington, North Carolina and after receiving his early education there and at An-dover Academy, Massachusetts; he studied engineering at the United States Naval Acad-emy and earned a PhD from Duke University in physics. Captain Veazey excelled aboard submarines for seven years during the Cold War and converted to submarine engineering duty. As an engineering duty officer, he served at the Naval Ship Engineering Center, Chief of Naval Development, Naval Intelligence Center, Naval Surface Warfare Center, and United States Naval Academy. Captain Veazey re-tired after 24 years of honorable service. Following naval service, he worked within industry supporting the Navy, and as an entre-preneur and developer. He held 19 patents. A vibrant member of the civic community, he served as President of the King George Chamber of Commerce, founding member of the County Historical Society, and members of the Lions Club and Military Officers Associa-tion of America. Ed Veazey is survived by his wife Joy; sons Ted and Warren; daughters Karen and Ginger; daughters-in-law Kristin and Jenna; sons-in- law Joseph and Wes; and ten grandchildren. I extend my deepest condolences to his family members and anyone who had the privilege of knowing this fine gentleman. He was a very loved man whose service both to his commu-nity and our Nation, will be dearly missed. Mr. Speaker, I implore you and my col-leagues to join me as we honor the memory of Captain Ed Veazey. f 
CHINESE CHRISTIANS DECLARE WITH ONE VOICE OPPOSITION TO RELIGIOUS OPPRESSION 
HON. DANA ROHRABACHER 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 26, 2018 Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, last month, nearly 300 Chinese Christian pastors publicly signed ‘‘A Declaration for the Sake of the Christian Faith.’’ In so doing, they have risked severe persecution, imprisonment, and even death in China’s vast network of horri-fying re-education and forced-labor camps. These courageous champions for Jesus Christ, the Christian faith, and religious free-dom have shocked and shamed China’s com-munist regime before the world. I regret to inform the people of the United States that a terrifying new round of attacks on Christians has been taking place in China. And earlier this year, President Xi Jinping in-troduced a five-year plan to ‘‘Sinicize’’ all that country ’s religions by blending them with ‘‘Chinese characteristics’’ such as loyalty to the Communist Party. Over the past several months, the govern-ment has taken violent steps to fulfill this plan by closing and razing hundreds of Christian churches and seizing Bibles. Under the new crackdown, children and Communist Party members are banned from churches in some areas, and Party officials have forced Chris-tians to replace posters of Jesus with portraits of President Xi Jinping. Reports have also confirmed that numerous Chinese Christians were sentenced to up to 13 years in jail for in-volvement in the so-called ‘‘cult’’ known as Christianity. President Trump is standing for freedom and doing what is right rather than kowtowing to Chinese President Xi Jinping. He is de-manding that China end its appalling persecu-tion of Christians and other religious minori-ties—and I am proud to be shoulder-to-shoul-der with him in the fight to stop this infamous case of communist terror. The American people are outraged by Presi-dent Xi’s depraved behavior toward Christians. It must stop now. We should make that part of any future discussions. China is ruled by a brutal dictatorship. In fact, the so-called Peo-ple’s Republic of China doesn’t have any democratic institutions. We must tell President Xi that the people and government of the United States will not give China trade bene-fits until the anti-Christian attacks stop. The people of communist China want free-dom. There are millions of Christians in that country-but its atheist dictatorship rules over people with an iron fist. We the people of the United States condemn the Chinese Com-munist Party for their bloody attacks on their own citizens. President Xi must end this inhu-man and cruel persecution of Christians and allow religious freedom before the world will accept China as a civilized country. Chinese state media falsely claim that its citizens enjoy freedom of religion. In fact, their constitution states: ‘‘No state organ, public or-ganization or individual may compel citizens to believe in, or not to believe in, any religion; nor may they discriminate against citizens who believe in, or do not believe in, any religion.’’ Ever since Xi Jinping became president of China, in 2012, he has consolidated and cen-tralized his power and cultivated a cult of per-sonality like Mao. ‘‘Xi Jinping Thought’’ has even been added to China’s constitution—a status reserved only for Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping previously. This means that any challenge to President Xi’s policies—in-cluding his assault on Christians—may now be regarded as a threat to Communist Party rule. More than 70 million Catholics and Protes-tants live in China, which means that China will have the world’s largest Christian popu-lation in a few decades. I call on all of Amer-ica’s Christian leaders—and religious leaders of all faiths—to join with President Trump and all Americans in condemning China’s hateful acts and praying that Chinese Christians will one day be able to live in China in freedom, in justice, and in religious liberty for all. I include in the R
ECORD a Joint Statement by Pastors; A Declaration for the Sake of the Christian Faith: 
On the morning of Saturday, September 1, 2018, one of China’s leading house churches, Early Rain Covenant Church in Chengdu, posted a joint statement on Facebook declar-ing its stance on the new religious regula-tions. So far, the document has been signed by 116 church leaders* across the country and the call for signatures remains open. This is an interesting and important docu-ment for the ongoing development of the house church’s response to the new regula-tions, particularly as the church continues to reflect on and articulate its theology of the gospel and the kingdom, rather than re-sorting to language of liberty and rights. Along with Early Rain’s 95 Theses, docu-ments like this are important for the history of the church in China and should encourage Christians across the globe. We are a group of Chinese Christians, cho-sen by the Most High God to be His humble servants, serving as pastors for Christian churches throughout various towns and cit-ies. We believe and are obligated to teach the world that the one true and living Triune God is the Creator of the universe, of the world, and of all people. All men should wor-ship God and not any man or thing. We be-lieve and are obligated to teach the world that all men, from national leaders to beg-gars and prisoners, have sinned. They will

die once and then be judged in righteousness. Apart from the grace and redemption of God, all men would eternally perish. We believe and are obligated to teach the world that the crucified and risen Jesus is the only Head of the global church, the sole Savior of all man-kind, and the everlasting Ruler and supreme Judge of the universe. To all who repent and believe in Him, God will give eternal life and an eternal Kingdom. In September 2017, the State Council issued the new ‘‘Regulations on the Administration of Religious Affairs’’ and began imple-menting these regulations in February 2018. Ever since then, Christian churches across China have suffered varying degrees of perse-cution, contempt, and misunderstanding from government departments during public worship and religious practices, including various administrative measures that at-tempt to alter and distort the Christian faith. Some of these violent actions are un-precedented since the end of the Cultural Revolution. These include demolishing crosses on church buildings, violently remov-ing expressions of faith like crosses and cou-plets hanging on Christians’ homes, forcing and threatening churches to join religious organizations controlled by the government, forcing churches to hang the national flag or to sing secular songs praising the State and political parties, banning the children of Christians from entering churches and re-ceiving religious education, and depriving churches and believers of the right to gather freely. We believe that these unjust actions are an abuse of government power and have led to serious conflicts between political and reli-gious parties in Chinese society. These ac-tions infringe on the human freedoms of reli-gion and conscience and violate the uni-versal rule of law. We are obligated to an-nounce bad news to the authorities and to all of society: God hates all attempts to sup-press human souls and all acts of persecution against the Christian church, and he will condemn and judge them with righteous judgment. But we are even more obligated to pro-claim good news to the authorities and to all of society: Jesus, the only begotten Son of God, the Savior and King of mankind, in order to save us sinners was killed, was bur-ied, and rose from the dead by the power of God, destroying the power of sin and death. In His love and compassion God has prepared forgiveness and salvation for all who are willing to believe in Jesus, including Chinese people. At any time, anyone can repent from any sin, turn to Christ, fear God, obtain eternal life, and bring great blessing from God upon his family and country. For the sake of faith and conscience, for the spiritual benefits of the authorities in China and of society as a whole, and ulti-mately for the glory, holiness, and right-eousness of God, we make the following dec-laration to the Chinese government and to all of society: 1. Christian churches in China believe un-conditionally that the Bible is the Word and Revelation of God. It is the source and final authority of all righteousness, ethics, and salvation. If the will of any political party, the laws of any government, or the com-mands of any man directly violate the teach-ings of the Bible, harming men’s souls and opposing the gospel proclaimed by the church, we are obligated to obey God rather than men, and we are obligated to teach all members of the church to do the same. 2. Christian churches in China are eager and determined to walk the path of the cross of Christ and are more than willing to imi-tate the older generation of saints who suf-fered and were martyred for their faith. We are willing and obligated under any cir-cumstance to face all government persecu-tion, misunderstanding, and violence with peace, patience, and compassion. For when churches refuse to obey evil laws, it does not stem from any political agenda; it does not stem from resentment or hostility; it stems only from the demands of the gospel and from a love for Chinese society. 3. Christian churches in China are willing to obey authorities in China whom God has appointed and to respect the government’s authority to govern society and human con-duct. We believe and are obligated to teach all believers in the church that the authority of the government is from God and that as long as the government does not overstep the boundaries of secular power laid out in the Bible and does not interfere with or vio-late anything related to faith or the soul, Christians are obligated to respect the au-thorities, to pray fervently for their benefit, and to pray earnestly for Chinese society. For the sake of the gospel, we are willing to suffer all external losses brought about by unfair law enforcement. Out of a love for our fellow citizens, we are willing to give up all of our earthly rights. 4. For this reason, we believe and are obli-gated to teach all believers that all true churches in China that belong to Christ must hold to the principle of the separation of church and state and must proclaim Christ as the sole head of the church. We declare that in matters of external conduct, church-es are willing to accept lawful oversight by civil administration or other government de-partments as other social organizations do. But under no circumstances will we lead our churches to join a religious organization controlled by the government, to register with the religious administration depart-ment, or to accept any kind of affiliation.

HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 26, 2018 Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Wendy Zapata as a woman of the year. She is a well-known as a community leader, mentor, activist and small business owner.

As a member of the Soroptimist International, Ms. Zapata generously dedicates her time to better the status of women and girls in the commu-nity by encouraging social and economic em-powerment for women.

RAISING AWARENESS OF NA-TIONAL BULLYING PREVENTION MONTH 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 26, 2018 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to commemorate National Bullying Prevention Month, a nationwide campaign held during the month of October to provide efforts in uniting communities to educate and raise awareness of bullying prevention. As a Co-Chair of the House Congressional Children’s Caucus, member of the Mental Health Caucus, and Ranking Member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations, I have been saddened by one episode after another of children losing their lives and the lack of a coordinated response to incidents of bullying. In September of 2018, the Jackson Lee Anti-Bullying bill, H.R. 68, the Tiffany Joslyn Juvenile Accountability Block Grant Reauthor-ization Act was passed by the House. This legislation makes positive steps toward reform in juvenile justice and targets bullying and bullying prevention. This bill: targets bullying and bullying pre-vention; reauthorizes the award of grants to consider this problem in the amount of $30 million for one year; and, subjects grants to accountability measures: the Office of Inspec-tor General in the Department of Justice (DOJ) must conduct annual audits of selected grant recipients and the Department of Justice must submit an annual certification to Con-gress and identify and report on duplicative grant awards. In October of 2015, I held an Anti-Bullying Town Hall Hearing in my district where over 40 witnesses—organizations, experts, bullying victims, and even bullies themselves—came out and shared their stories and experiences. National Bullying Prevention Month was founded by the PACER Center’s National Bul-lying Prevention Center, this campaign has been recognized by school communities all over the United States, for the past 12 years. Bullying is defined as the use of repetitive aggressive behavior such as force, intimida-tion, threat, or abuse, which depicts an imbal-ance of power, socially or physically. Studies show that at some point in a child’s life, they experience bullying in some capacity, no matter what form. No single factor puts a child at risk of being bullied or bullying others. Time and time again, the root causes of bul-lying are racial, gender, sexual orientation, and religious discrimination. Justification for this matter shows that when children perceived as different are not in sup-portive environments, they are more prone to being bullied. Bullying based on religious differences tend to be the result of misinformation or spreading of negative perceptions on how an individual expresses their belief. American schools harbor approximately 2.1 million bullies and 2.7 million of their victims. Derrin Bridges, a 13-year-old boy from Kan-sas City, Missouri, was bullied and held at gunpoint by a 17-year-old. Derrin who was noted to be on the autism spectrum, was severely mistreated; he was verbally assaulted with racial slurs, he was physically beaten, and money was stolen from him. I extend my deepest sympathies to Darren Bridges, his loving mother, Emily Bridges, and the rest of his family. This type of disheartening experience can affect a child for a lifetime. It is important to note that a significant in-crease in bullying rates is due to the prevalent use of technology among teens. The internet enables information to spread far and wide across the globe with the click of a button. It is estimated that in 2011, approximately 2.2 million students experienced cyberbullying. Cyberbullying is a form of bullying that hap-pens over any digital device. This consists of sending and posting nega-tive, presumptuous, or harmful content about someone else, as well as sharing private infor-mation about someone in aim to cause humil-iation. Social media is an avenue that children and teens can easily access and use to engage in cyberbullying. Sites such as Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter, and YouTube, are all plat-forms where the risk of cyberbullying is preva-lent. With easy access to an individual’s page, users gain the ability to search and post dis-creditable information anonymously about any-one. Bullying is now increasingly viewed as a contributor to the inflexed rates of suicide amongst youth. It can leave a harsh toll on those affected, causing lasting impacts on mental health, sub-stance use and suicide. In 2016, Brandy Vela, an 18-year-old high school resident of my Congressional district, took her own life after experiencing relentless cyberbullying. Brandy was a beautiful young lady, who was friendly and all around well-liked by her schoolmates. Despite all the love given to her from friends and family, she took her own life due to the threats and messages she would continuously receive online, causing her to feel worthless. I cannot fathom the sorrow that the Vela family endured at that time. Brandy’s memory lives on through her fam-ily and friends along with all those who work tirelessly to exterminate bullying . The American youth witnesses bullying at least once a day. Suicide rates solely among 10 to 14 year olds have grown more than so percent over the last three decades. It is important that we act promptly to pre-vent such instances from happening; many of the deadly cases of bullying arise when chil-dren are teased and tormented simply for being different. Our children are our future hence they must be our first priority. f 
HONORING SHERIFF RICHARD CUT-TING AND UNDERSHERIFF MI-CHAEL BADGER ON THEIR RE-TIREMENTS 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 26, 2018 Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate both Sheriff Richard Cutting and Undersheriff Michael Badger on their retire-ments from the Essex County Sheriff’s Depart-ment.

County Deputy to become a certified Police and Corrections Instructor as well as the first Jail Administrator before taking on the role of Undersheriff. In 2010, he was appointed to fill the office of Essex County Sheriff and has since then run two successful campaigns. From the opening of the Department’s new Public Safety Building to the success of his animal cruelty and opioid task forces, Sheriff Richard Cutting has undoubtedly made a last-ing, positive impact on the Department. Undersheriff Michael Badger started in the Sheriff’s Department in 1987 as a Deputy Sheriff and Jail Dispatcher, and worked his way up through the ranks until he became Undersheriff in 2011. During his tenure in the Department, he implemented the Project Life Saver Program in Essex County and was in-strumental in the Essex County Jail’s transition to its modem Public Safety Building. Truly dedicated to serving his community, Under-sheriff Badger also sits on the Essex County Drug Court and has served for 19 years as a volunteer firefighter in Moriah. Both men have exhibited outstanding com-mitment to Essex County, leaving their posi-tions with big shoes to fill. On behalf of New York’s 21st District, I want to join the Essex County community in honoring Sheriff Richard Cutting and Undersheriff Michael Badger and thanking them for their many years of public service.

HONORING MICHAEL & LESLIE TUGETMAN 
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 26, 2018 Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor two members of the Northeast Jewish Center Community who this year are being honored at the Center’s Annual Event, Michael and Leslie Tugetman. Michael is a talented musician, singer, song-writer as well as a family health physician who owns an urgent care practice. He performs in a Jewish music/Rock cover band, MIDlife with other physicians, lawyers, accountants, Real Estate executives and other professionals. For most of her career, Leslie was a cor-porate interiors renovation project manager. For the past 11 years she was the office man-ager of a busy physician’s office. These days she offsets her time by helping with adminis-trative duties in Michael’s practice. Leslie has been known to aid friends and family with inte-rior design issues in their homes or offices. Michael and Leslie are the proud parents of two wonderful children, Graham and Jessica. Graham, married to Alana, teaches the next generation of Jewish children in Toronto, and is a tremendously gifted drummer. They are the parents of two charming sons, Yonaton and Asher. Dr. Jessica, married to Dr. Noah, are busy training in Pediatrics and Surgery, re-spectively. Michael and Leslie both have a terrific sense of humor and share a deep love for their community. The Northeast Jewish Center has made a terrific choice in honoring them with a Special Service Award at this year’s Annual Event. Congratulations to them both on receiving this wonderful honor and I want to also thank them for their service to the community. CELEBRATING THE 90TH ANNIVER-SARY OF THE WARNORS THE-ATRE HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 26, 2018 Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the Warnors Theatre of Fresno, CA on the occasion of its 90th anniversary. Since its creation on October 20, 1928, the Warnors Theatre has maintained its historic landmark graciously alive by providing contin-uous use of its facility for entertainment and live events for the local community to come to-gether and enjoy. For nine decades, the Warnors Theatre has thrived in the heart of downtown Fresno and today it is recognized as a historic entertain-ment icon. The Spanish revival architectural style facility has served the greater Fresno area through many entertainment events. The Berlin Philharmonic, AC/DC, The Clash, R.E.M. and Miles Davis are merely a small number of legendary artists and entertainers who have performed at the Warnors Theatre. Since the amphitheater’s founding, mem-bers have worked with the local community to ensure efforts towards its progression and continued success. Warnors Theatre presently strives to promote an enriched experience for the community. With the passing of its former owner Frank Caglia, the facility was generously donated and is now looked after by a non-profit organi-zation. Today, Warnors Theatre is a non-profit organization that continues to have a historical value in the community. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the Warnors Theatre 90th anni-versary. I commend the service of all the members of this organization who have worked collectively to assure the historic land-mark continue thriving in serving the commu-nity.

70 YEARS OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH SRI LANKA 
HON. DINA TITUS 
OF NEVADA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 26, 2018 Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to rec-ognize that October marks 70 years of diplo-matic relations between the United States and Sri Lanka. I am proud to serve as Co-Chair of the Sri Lanka Caucus. U.S. development and humani-tarian assistance to Sri Lanka, totaling roughly $2 billion, has improved livelihoods and living conditions across Sri Lanka through substan-tial investments in agriculture, economic devel-opment, education, health care, energy, and humanitarian activities. The 2015 presidential election in Sri Lanka paved the way for renewed engagement in support of Sri Lanka’s commitments to reform and reconciliation. In December 2016, Sri Lanka was selected to develop a Millennium Challenge Corporation Compact. In August 2017, we celebrated the creation of the Sri Lanka America Association of Las Vegas to foster solidarity within the Sri Lankan commu-nity in Southern Nevada. In February 2018, Sri Lanka and the United States signed a bilateral agreement to have the Peace Corps re-estab-lish programs in Sri Lanka. The United States is Sri Lanka’s largest export market; and as a partner legislature of the House Democracy Partnership, Sri Lanka’s Parliament has en-gaged in training and exchange programs with the United States. It is my hope that the U.S. will continue to support Sri Lanka on a path of reform and de-velopment and continue to reinforce our shared goals of regional security and stability, good governance, and commitment to demo-cratic values. In doing so, our relationship will continue to flourish. f 
HONORING CATHY SADERLUND WITH CALIFORNIA’S THIRD DIS-TRICT WOMAN OF THE YEAR AWARD 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 26, 2018 Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Cathy Saderlund as a woman of the year. She is the epitome of public service, continuously making invaluable contributions with unparalleled selflessness and dedication. In her roles as Lake County Auditor-Controller and Disaster Finance Chief, she put forth ex-traordinary efforts during the eight wildfire dis-asters Lake County faced over the past four fire seasons. In the face of these repeated dis-asters, she served full-time in the Emergency Operations Centers while unflinchingly bal-ancing the priorities and demands of her elect-ed office. Ms. Saderlund repeatedly exceeded expectations as she managed disaster spend-ing, tracked reimbursements, and made cer-tain that all available state and federal support would be in place for future recovery efforts. Her value to the community in managing the enormous costs of these disasters cannot be overstated. Ms. Saderlund is dedicated to serving the public and continues to do so with excellence no matter what challenges may arise. In addition to her dedication to the du-ties of her elected position, she demonstrates her devotion to her community through her volunteer work. For more than 25 years, she has served as the Area Director for the local Special Olympics, spearheading year-round sports training and athletic competition for chil-dren and adults with intellectual disabilities. Through this work she has enabled countless individuals with special needs to develop physical fitness, demonstrate courage, and share their remarkable gifts and skills with their families, fellow athletes, and the commu-nity. Ms. Saderlund is an inspirational example of service to the community both through her professional and volunteer roles.

who passed away Monday, September 24, 2018. Robert Hevey honored his country with a long career of service, first as a United States Marine, and then for over 30 years as an electronic technician for the federal govern-ment. His life was an example of commitment, love and service from which all of us would be wise to learn. Robert was born in Pawtucket, Rhode Is-land on May 10, 1930. One of six children, Robert enlisted with the Marine Corps when he was 17 years old in 1947, requiring his par-ents’ approval. He served with the 1st Marine Corps Division, 1st Weapon Battalion as 81mm Mortar Platoon Squad Leader. Sta-tioned at numerous locations from Guam to Quantico, Virginia, Robert served in the Ma-rine Corps for four years before being honor-ably discharged in 1951. In 1953, he married Miriam Freedman, who preceded him in death in February 2012, and they raised four daughters together: Karen, Carol, Beverly, and Andrea. He went on to have eight grandchildren and four great-grand-children. A loving and devoted husband, father and grandfather, Robert was a model for all of us not only in his work, but in his personal life. Mr. Speaker, I ask you to join me in hon-oring Mr. Hevey and in thanking the Hevey family for their incredible sacrifices, devotion, and service to our nation; words cannot ex-press our gratitude. On behalf of America’s First District, we say thank you.

HONORING THE WASHINGTON AREA WOMEN’S FOUNDATION 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 26, 2018 Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask the House of Representatives to join me in celebrating the Washington Area Women’s Foundation (Foundation) and its Leadership Luncheon taking place on October 30, 2018, in Washington, D.C., and in recognizing the women and girls of color this organization sup-ports. The Foundation mobilizes the community to ensure that economically vulnerable women and girls in the Washington region have the resources they need to thrive. Since 1998, the Foundation has worked to transform the lives of women and girls in the Washington region through research, grants and advocacy. The Foundation has provided more than $12 mil-lion in grants to more than 170 community- based organizations in the Washington region. The Foundation Leadership Luncheon has previously raised more than $860,000 for women and girls of color and for local organi-zations. As the Washington region’s only public foundation specifically committed to investing in women and girls, the Foundation works to create economic opportunities that have posi-tive ripple effects across society and open doors to progress. An open door can change a woman’s life and the lives of those around her. Not all doors are open to all women. That is why we will not rest until all women, espe-cially young women and girls of color, have equal access to economic security, safety and opportunity. Mr. Speaker, I ask the House of Represent-atives to join me in recognizing the Wash-ington Area Women’s Foundation for its con-tinued support of women and girls of color in the Washington region. f 
CELEBRATING THE 150TH ANNI-VERSARY OF BLOOMFIELD COL-LEGE 
HON. RODNEY P. FRELINGHUYSEN 
OF NEW JERSEY  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 26, 2018 Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Bloomfield College located in the Township of Bloomfield, New Jersey, on the occasion of its 150th Anniversary. For 150 years, Bloomfield College has been helping students write their own stories. With its beginnings as the German Theological School founded by the Presbytery of Newark in 1868, the College has evolved to become one of New Jersey’s best private colleges, serving a diverse population and preparing students for success in a multicultural and global society. Originally located on the grounds of First German Presbyterian Church in Newark, New Jersey, the school moved to the former Bloomfield Academy on Franklin Street in Bloomfield in 1872, which was renamed Seibert Hall in honor of the school’s first presi-dent, Reverend George Seibert. The hall served as a dormitory, classrooms, faculty housing, and library. In 1909, the New Jersey Legislature author-ized the school to grant the Bachelor of Arts degree in addition to a Bachelor of Divinity. In 1913, the German Theological Seminary changed its name to Bloomfield Theological Seminary. Over the years, as the local population began to reflect greater diversity, students came to the college not only to study theology, but to gain a solid liberal arts education. In post-World War I years, the college received approval for a four-year program and the school’s name was again changed to Bloom-field College and Seminary. In 1961, the school simply became known as Bloomfield College. Today, Bloomfield College is on the cutting edge of innovation in higher education, offer-ing over 60 majors and concentrations in seven academic divisions. Bloomfield is an in-stitution where over 2,000 bold and coura-geous students from all corners of the globe can come to find themselves. Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and our col-leagues join me in congratulating Bloomfield College, on the occasion of its 150th Anniver-sary.

CONGRATULATING MRS. WINONA BLOHM ON HER 100TH BIRTHDAY 
HON. BLAINE LUETKEMEYER 
OF MISSOURI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 26, 2018 Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mrs. Winona Blohm who is celebrating her 100th Birthday. The world was a different place in 1918. The Model T was the newest car style with gas prices around 25 cents per gallon; the Eif-fel Tower was the tallest structure in the world; Woodrow Wilson was President; and the Bos-ton Red Sox won the World Series with the help of Babe Ruth. The average price for bread was 10 cents, butter was 58 cents, and eggs were 57 cents. And World War I officially ended with Armistice Day on November 11. The changes to the world in Mrs. Blohm’s life-time have been monumental and extremely exciting. Mrs. Blohm was born in Black Walnut, Mis-souri and lived in the Portage Des Sioux area until she married Vincent Blohm in 1941. Vin-cent and Winona bought their farm in Orchard Farm, Missouri where she continues to live today. Throughout her life, Mrs. Blohm has enjoyed numerous hobbies. For many years Winona and her husband served on the board of St. Charles County Farm Bureau and were active members. She is a skilled gardener and has produced many bountiful harvests. Using the lessons learned from their mother, Mrs. Blohm’s children now plant a beautiful flower garden for her to enjoy every year. Of her many pastimes, she also loves creating beau-tiful wedding cakes and quilting elegant quilts for her family and loved ones. Mrs. Blohm and I share a love of baseball and the St. Louis Cardinals. She enjoys watching the games and cheering the Car-dinals on faithfully throughout their season. Most importantly to her, Winona’s daugh-ters, Sharon and Janet and their husbands Vince and John, her six grandchildren, and 13 great-grandchildren are all joining her in cele-brating this incredible milestone birthday.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 26, 2018 Mr. VELA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in rec-ognition of the 80th Anniversary of the Hous-ing Authority of the City of Brownsville (HACB), which has provided quality affordable housing for thousands of families and individ-uals in Brownsville. HACB, created under the U.S. Housing Act of 1937, is dedicated to providing safe and af-fordable housing for those with low to mod-erate income. In 1939, with funding from the federal government, HACB constructed its first public housing development, a 150 unit family dwelling named Buena Vista. Since then, HACB has created thousands of units in our community, providing those most in need with access to quality affordable housing. Through partnerships with non-profit organi-zations, including the Brownsville Housing Management Corporation, the Brownsville Housing Finance Corporation, and the Brownsville Housing Opportunity Corporation, HACB has successfully utilized federal and state resources to expand access to housing. This collaboration allowed HACB to begin con-struction this year on its 21st property. In 1975, HACB’s Housing Choice Voucher Program, commonly known as Section 8, was established to provide federal housing and as-sistance so that families could use their fed-eral benefits to live in neighborhoods across the city. Today, HACB provides assistance for 2,582 families in Brownsville. HACB is a driving force, providing high-qual-ity affordable housing and creating the condi-tions necessary to empower our communities. Together, housing is a critical service that pro-motes health, safety, employment, upward mobility, and educational opportunities for South Texas families. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank you for the op-portunity to honor and celebrate the 80th Anni-versary of the Housing Authority of the City of Brownsville. I proudly commend HACB’s Board of Commissioners, Administration and Staff for their leadership and hard work help-ing our community and making a lasting posi-tive impact in the lives of South Texans.

HONORING ARIS ANAGNOS 
HON. JUDY CHU 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 26, 2018 Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Aris Anagnos, who passed away on July 23, 2018 at the age of 94. We will remember him for his tireless dedication to justice and humanitarianism. Mr. Anagnos was born in Athens, Greece in 1923. As a young man during World War II, he escaped Nazi occupation to serve in North Africa with the Greek Army, fighting alongside Allied Forces. Following the war, he made his way to Los Angeles, where he earned a de-gree in business administration from UCLA and went on to a successful career in real es-tate. Throughout his life, he remained dedi-cated to peace, justice, and civil rights both in his community and around the globe. He served on the Board of Directors of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Southern California, including a term as Presi-dent, and founded the Humanitarian Law Project/International Education Development Fund. He spearheaded philanthropic projects like the Saint Sophia Cathedral Foundation’s Senior Citizen Home and served as a longtime board member and patron of People Assisting the Homeless (PATH), a nonprofit organization helping homeless individuals and families in California to find stable, permanent housing. In response to the 1967 through 1974 mili-tary dictatorship in his home country, Mr. Anagnos and his late wife Carolyn organized the Committee for Democratic Freedoms in Greece, and went on to co-found the Amer-ican Hellenic Council, a non-partisan political advocacy organization promoting democracy, human rights, peace, and stability in Southern Europe and the Eastern Mediterranean. Mr. Anagnos later established the Peace Center in Los Angeles, home to several peace and human rights organizations. His tireless efforts to make a lasting positive impact have touched the lives of countless individuals at home and abroad. Mr. Anagnos leaves behind a remarkable legacy of philanthropy, activism, humani-tarianism, and community service, and it is my honor to commemorate his life. f 
HONORING JACK RODACK 
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 26, 2018 Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a member of the community who this year is being recognized by the Northeast Jewish Center (NEJC) at their annual event, Mr. Jack Rodack. Jack was born in the Tremont section of the Bronx to Aaron and Getrude. He grew up in Kingsbridge and attended public school at De Witt Clinton High School. After graduation from high school, he attended the Bronx cam-pus of Hunter College with dreams of becom-ing either a history teacher or a pharmacist. However, Jack dropped out following his first year, and after serving in the military, he took a stab at clerical work with a finance com-pany. This position inspired him to complete his formal education and so in 1976, he left a full-time job and enrolled in the Bronx campus of Fordham University’s Business College. He graduated Cum Laude in 1979 with a double major in accounting and finance. After graduation, Jack spent the first three years of his professional career in public ac-counting and then moved onto a commercial finance field examiner position with several major New York money center banks, launch-ing a 31 year career from 1982 until his retire-ment in 2013. Upon retiring, Jack cared for his elderly mother, who passed away in 2014. Addition-ally, he now spends most of his time reading, managing his stock and bond portfolio, watch-ing TV news programs and movies as well as enjoying his favorite pastimes of both coin and stamp collecting. Jack’s best times or what he would call his sunshine days are those spent at NEJC, whether it be for attending services or various holiday events, which he joined as a member in 2015. He hopes to continue to participate in the daily life of the wonderful, warm, most friendly and supportive NEJC synagogue for years to come. NEJC has made a terrific choice honoring Jack as a Guest of Honor at this year’s event. Congratulations to him on receiving this won-derful, well-deserved recognition. f 
HONORING LYN CALIENDO ON THE OCCASION OF HER RETIREMENT 
HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO 
OF CONNECTICUT  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 26, 2018 Ms. D
ELAURO. Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to rise today to join the many family, friends, and colleagues who have gath-er to extend heartfelt congratulations to my dear friend, Lyn Caliendo, as she marks her retirement from Vinal Technical High School in Middletown, Connecticut. Lyn has spent her professional life as an educator and adminis-trator having a profound impact on the thou-sands of students with whom she has worked. I have often spoke of our nation’s need for talented, creative educators who stand ready to help our children learn and grown. For so many years, Lyn has been just that kind of teacher. She has helped to shape the lives of countless young people, ensuring that they have a strong academic foundation on which to build their future success. Her hard work and imaginative spirit have earned her the re-spect and admiration of students and col-leagues alike. I have no doubt that her pres-ence will be missed in the halls of Vinal Tech. Lyn’s work as an educator extends beyond school walls as well. For many years, she has been deeply involved in helping to promote and expand the work of Discovery to Cure— an effort to provide women with new methods for the prevention, early detection and treat-ment of gynecologic cancers. The largest an-nual awareness and fundraising event hosted by Discovery to Cure is the Bev Levy Walk. Named after a dear friend who lost her battle with breast cancer, Lyn has helped to orga-nize the event since its inception, spending untold hours ensuring the event’s great suc-cess each year. Though she will no longer be teaching at Vinal, Lyn does not know how not to work. In her retirement, she will teach part-time at Gateway Community College and holds an ad-ditional part-time position with Connecticut Open—continuing to indulge in two of her greatest passions, education and tennis. I have no doubt she will continue her efforts with Discovery to Cure and perhaps expand her volunteer efforts with other causes close to her heart. Lyn is a force of nature and I know she will continue her good work on be-half of others for many years to come. It would be remiss if I did not extend a per-sonal note of thanks to Lyn for her many

years of friendship and support. She has been a kindred spirit since we first met—she is more than a friend, she is family. I am grateful every day that she is always in my corner. Today, as she marks the end of one career and looks ahead to new opportunities, I am honored to stand and express my deepest thanks to Lyn Caliendo for her many invalu-able contributions to our community. I wish her many more years of health and happiness as she embarks on this new chapter.

CONGRATULATING LTC(RET) NICH-OLAS M. LAIACONA ON RECEIV-ING THE 2018 VETERAN OF THE YEAR AWARD 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 26, 2018 Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate LTC(Ret) Nicholas Laiacona on receiving the 2018 Veteran of the Year Award. Each year, the Friends of the NYS Military Museum and the Capitol District of NY Chap-ter, Association of the U.S. Army (AUSA) rec-ognize an outstanding veteran from the local community. This year’s awardee, LTC Laiacona, has made distinguished contribu-tions to his country as a soldier and to his community as a veteran. After entering the Army in 1966, LTC Laiacona served in the Mekong Delta region of Vietnam as a Platoon Leader and Company Commander in the Mobile Riverine Force of the 9th Infantry Division. He would later fulfill a number of assignments as a member of the Army’s Ordnance Corps, and was selected as one of the first officers in the Army Acquisition Corps in 1985. By the end of his 24 years of service, LTC Laiacona had received numerous awards and decorations, among them the Pur-ple Heart and Vietnam Service Medal with 4 stars. LTC Laiacona’s service to his country did not end with his retirement from the Army in 1991. His expertise has supported the work of the U.S. Army Armament Research, Develop-ment and Engineering Center, and he remains actively involved in several Veterans organiza-tions, including the AUSA, where he formerly served as President of the Capital District Chapter and currently serves on its Executive Committee. On behalf of New York’s 21st District, I want to congratulate LTC(Ret) Nicholas Laiacona on his well-deserved award of 2018 Veteran of the Year. We are thankful for his service and dedication to both his country and community.

HONORING ANNA SUTTON WITH CALIFORNIA’S THIRD DISTRICT WOMAN OF THE YEAR AWARD 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 26, 2018 Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Anna Sutton as a woman of the year. She is a healthcare professional who has dedicated her career to the care of mothers and children. From her work as a school nurse to her current role as Director of Public Health Nursing at the Yolo County Health and Human Services Agency, her goal has always been to improve the health and quality of life of fami-lies in her community. Ms . Sutton fulfills many roles, lending her time and expertise to the Maternal, Child and Adolescent Health Pro-gram, the Yolo County Infectious Disease Pro-grams, the Yolo County Help Me Grow Lead-ership Team, the Child Abuse Prevention Council, the Programs Benefitting Children Workgroup, Resilient Yolo, the American Col-lege of OB/GYNs Maternal Mental Health Ex-pert Workgroup, and the Yolo County Maternal Mental Health Collaborative. As Chairwoman of the Yolo County Maternal Mental Health Collaborative, she has used her career exper-tise and firsthand experience as a mother to create an organization which promotes the health and wellbeing of new and expecting mothers. Under her leadership the organiza-tion has developed educational tools to create awareness of maternal mental health dis-orders and guide those in need to treatment. Her work gained recognition across disciplines and brought stakeholders together to create a common strategy for helping vulnerable moth-ers find help. Ms. Sutton dedicates her time, talent, and expertise to improving the health and wellbeing of mothers throughout Yolo County and works tirelessly to help particularly vulnerable mothers facing the stigma and iso-lation of maternal mental health disorders. Ms. Sutton is an integral part of Yolo County’s out-reach to mothers in need. She is continuously working to make a positive difference for mothers and children in her community and does so with unparalleled compassion and dedication. f 
HONORING TAMIE FRASIER 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 26, 2018 Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Tamie Frasier’s retire-ment after twenty-four years in public service, ten of which she served as the Napa County Treasurer–Tax Collector. Ms. Frasier is a fourth generation Napan, who is dedicated to our community. She has shown her commitment to Napa County throughout her twenty-four years working for the County, first as the Treasury Supervisor and then as the Assistant Treasurer–Tax Col-lector. In 2008, she became the Treasurer– Tax Collector. Throughout her tenure at the County, Ms. Frasier has worked to deliver the highest level of customer service for her fellow Napans. She has skillfully managed Napa County’s funds, particularly during the Great Recession. Ms. Frasier is always the first person to roll up her sleeves and help however she can, whether the person in need is a colleague or a taxpayer. She leads by example and never fails to pass up an opportunity to set an exam-ple of what professionalism and compassion in County Administration can, and should, be. Ms. Frasier has inspired her coworkers to pro-vide a high level of service to their fellow resi-dents of Napa County. After working for Napa County for twenty- four years, Ms. Frasier has an impressive breadth and depth of knowledge. She has taken it upon herself to share her insight by sitting on various panels whenever the oppor-tunity arises. Ms. Frasier is also active in local and state-wide organizations. She is a past President and current Board Member of So-roptimist International of Napa and the Bay Area Chair for the California Association of County Treasurers and Tax Collectors. She is a member of the California Associations of Country Treasurers and Tax Collectors and in-volved with the Government Investment Offi-cers Association and California Municipal Treasurers Association. Mr. Speaker, Ms. Tamie Frasier has had a long and rewarding career in public service and Napa County is better for it. It is therefore fitting and proper that we honor her here today. f 
PRAISING SANDRA DAY O’CONNOR, THE FIRST FEMALE SUPREME COURT JUSTICE 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 26, 2018 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize and pay tribute to Sandra Day O’Connor, the first woman to serve as an As-sociate Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Among the 20th century trailblazers, Sandra Day O’Connor ranks among the greatest lead-ers. It is a privilege to honor to this legal giant as we reflect on her career and commemorate her legacy as a path maker for women. On October 23, 2018, Justice O’Connor courageously announced that she is suffering from early onset Alzheimer’s disease and is retreating from public life. Born in El Paso, Texas, on March 26, 1930, Sandra Day spent part of her youth on her family’s Arizona ranch. Her family instilled in her a love of edu-cation, but schooling options near the ranch were limited for a young woman so her par-ents sent her to live with her grandmother in El Paso where she excelled at the Radford School for Girls and graduated high school two years early. After graduating from high school in 1946 and despite the probability that she might not be accepted because she was a woman, San-dra Day was accepted to Stanford University. Sandra Day graduated in 1950 with a bach-elor’s degree in economics and was admitted to Stanford Law School where she was an editor of the Stanford Law Review. Sandra Day graduated at the top of her law school class, finishing third in a class of 102 students, which included William Rehnquist whom she would later join as a colleague on the U.S. Supreme Court. While a law student at Stanford, Sandra Day met her future husband, John Jay O’Con-nor III and the two were married shortly after graduation. That union lasted for 57 years and produced 3 wonderful children: Scott O’Connor, Jay O’Connor, and Brian O’Connor. After graduating from law school, Sandra Day O’Connor busily went about applying to law firms in San Francisco and Los Angeles,

but because of the sexism against women, could not get a paying job as a lawyer. After turning down a paid position as a legal secretary, Sandra Day O’Connor began her legal career working as an unpaid attorney for the San Mateo County Attorney’s Office, where quickly she proved her merit and even-tually was promoted to Deputy County Attor-ney. In 1954, Sandra Day O’Connor left Cali-fornia to work in Frankfurt, Germany as a civil-ian attorney for the Quartermaster Masker Center, a site abroad for the U.S. Army Quar-termaster Corps. In 1957, she returned to the United States, settled in Arizona with her husband, and start-ed a private practice with another attorney. Eight years later, she began working as the Assistant Attorney General of Arizona. In 1969, Sandra Day O’Connor was ap-pointed to the Arizona State Senate to fill a vacated seat and was elected to that seat in her own right in 1970. Sandra Day O’Connor was reelected twice and was chosen by her colleagues to become the first female majority leader in any state senate. In 1975, Sandra Day O’Connor won election to the Superior Court of Maricopa County, and was appointed to the Arizona Supreme Court of Appeals four years later. Sandra Day O’Connor served as an Arizona State Supreme Court Justice for only two years before President Ronald Reagan nomi-nated her in 1981 to become the first female justice to serve on the United States Supreme Court. Politically, she was canny—and exhibited it well during her Senate confirmation hearings. She gracefully navigated politically precar-ious questions from senators but made her points, on national television, of noting her commitments to reduce crime and fix over-loaded federal courts. She was confirmed unanimously by the Senate. Despite her breast cancer diagnosis and a mastectomy, Justice Day O’Connor did not miss a day of court. Over the course of her 24 years on the court, the conservative justice became known as a moderating voice of reason. Sandra Day O’Connor was known for being a majority builder whenever possible, but also for being a swing vote in critical cases such as Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 306 (2003). It truly can be said that Justice Sandra Day O’Connor served as an inspiration for women around the world. Justice Sandra Day O’Connor broke down barriers for women in the legal profession to the betterment of that profession and the country as a whole. Justice Sandra Day O’Connor serves as a role model not only for girls and women, but for all those committed to equal justice under law. I urge my colleagues to join me in honoring the remarkable career and achievement of Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, an extraor-dinary American who was and remains an in-spiration to millions of people all over the world. RECOGNIZING THE 185TH ANNIVER-SARY OF ST. JAMES AT SAG BRIDGE CATHOLIC CHURCH IN LEMONT 
HON. DANIEL LIPINSKI 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 26, 2018 Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor St. James at Sag Bridge Catholic Church on the parish’s 185th anniver-sary. The oldest functioning church in northern Illinois serves almost 500 families who ‘‘bear witness to Jesus Christ by loving and serving one another to bring about the Kingdom of God.’’ St. James at Sag Bridge Church in Lemont is the sole country parish of the Catholic Arch-diocese of Chicago. In 1833 a rough log cabin served as the church building where Chicago’s first resident priest John Mary Irenaeus St. Cyr held mass for both Irish immigrants and 300 local Potawatomi Native Americans. Twenty years later in 1853, with the congregation growing in size, Bishop James Oliver Van de Velde laid the cornerstone of a new building built with limestone from a nearby quarry. From there, St. James at Sag Bridge operated as a mission church until 1882, when Rev-erend Joseph A. Bollman became the first per-manent pastor. Numerous additions have been made to the church and the parish grounds over the years, but the 1853 stone church building stands proud and tall today, a testament to the faith of all the parishioners who have worshipped here for all these years. The church has survived numerous dan-gers, including not only harsh winters but also dynamite blasting of the nearby canal and a 1991 tornado that did serious damage to the church building. In doing so, the parish has established itself as a symbol of endurance and the church stands as an important herit-age site. St. James at Sag Bridge and its neighboring cemetery are registered as parts of the Illinois and Michigan Canal Heritage Corridor, and in 1984, were listed on the Na-tional Register of Historic Places. St. James’ current pastor, Fr. Thomas Koys, maintains not only strong, faithful leadership of the parish, but has also founded the St. James Historical Society to celebrate the his-tory of the church as well as the American his-tory that the church has lived through. In July 2014, I had the honor of welcoming Fr. Koys as the Guest Chaplain in the House of Rep-resentatives where he delivered the day’s opening prayer. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring St. James at Sag Bridge Church and its parishioners on the 185th anniversary of the parish’s establishment. I look forward to joining in the celebration.

ALAMO: PRESERVING HISTORY 
HON. TED POE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 26, 2018 Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the Alamo is the most important place in Texas and in Texas History. It is the definition of all things Texan. It is about the people. The Texians—The Tejanos who gave their last full measure of devotion to a cause great-er than life itself—Liberty. It is about the beginning of our 9 years as a sovereign Republic. It is a symbol of the fierce independent streak that runs through our veins. Behind those crumbling church walls of the Alamo, there is a spirit that has forever shown the world shown who we are as Texans—our character: defiant, bold, fearless, fighters for freedom. The Alamo instills yet today an almost mys-tical spirit in all Texans native, and recent ar-rivals of pride. 187 Volunteers of all races; frontiersmen, lawyers, farmers, shopkeepers; men from Spain, Mexico, Germany, Scotland, England, most of the states and native Texians who were led by my hero Colonel William Barrett Travis, stood in righteous defiance against a dictator and tyranny. Such men as Davy Crockett (Tennessee), Jose´Gregorio Esparza (Tejano), James Bonham (South Carolina), James Bowie (Lou-isiana), and Brigido Guerrero (Mexican soldier that switched sides) and 180 more, stood their ground against the invaders. All have personal stories. Knowing and despite of the overwhelming odds, those Texians and Tejanos fell to their death rather than submit to oppression. They first embodied the phrase ‘‘Don’t Mess with Texas.’’ It is quite a remarkable story. No people anywhere have such a history of how they all, gave all. From the ashes of the burning Alamo—the phoenix of a republic was born, because of these Freedom Fighters of 1836. After the Battle of the Alamo, Texas gained independence on the plains of San Jacinto where Sam Houston and his boys defeated the invaders. Then, Texas remained an independent na-tion for nine years. I first came to the Alamo as a kid in Mrs. Wilson’s Texas history class in Houston. A lot has changed since then. It has changed even more since 1836. There was no Five and Dime Woolworths store across the street. Neither was there a tattoo parlor. Colonel Travis didn’t buy a $54.99 combo ticket for Ripley’s Believe It or Not either. The years of encroachment and commer-cialization of sacred ground, where the blood of the Sons of Texas consecrated the land should be a deep concern for all Texans and Americans, not just the citizens of the great city of San Antonio. As Land Commissioner George P. Bush said, ‘‘When people visit the Alamo, almost all are underwhelmed with the small size of the Alamo grounds.’’ Visionary, Land Commissioner George P. Bush has presented a bold plan to restore the Alamo battlefield to much of what it was in 1836. I strongly support the efforts of Commis-sioner Bush, Mayor Nirenburg, and the San Antonio City Council on approval of the Alamo Master Plan to make sure Texans, and the world visitors know that our history is like no other place—because there is but one Alamo. San Antonio recently approved leasing land to the State of Texas to implement this plan.

I congratulate them on doing so. Texas heritage is unique—our heritage is unique. Alamo Commander Travis has inspired my life. His letter was on my wall at the court house when I was a judge. It is proudly displayed in my office in Wash-ington. At the bottom of my stationary are the words ‘‘I shall never surrender or retreat.’’ My first grandson is named Barrett Houston. And I end all my letters as did Travis: God and Texas. The Alamo deserves nothing but topnotch care and preservation, restoration of the 1836 battlefield footprint, and an accompanying mu-seum to display the hundreds of Alamo arti-facts that are uniquely Texan. The Alamo, 100 years old at the time of the battle, has incurred much disrespect and ne-glect. For example, in the 1800’s the Federal Army used the church as a barn, warehouse, and stable until the Catholic Church reclaimed it. Fortunately, the Daughters of the Republic of Texas, now the State of Texas, are making sure history is preserved. But, most importantly, we must ensure that the history of the Alamo and its relentless de-fenders is accurately told. Including the history of the families that stayed with their husbands, fathers, and sons. There is no room for revisionist history at the sacred ground of Texas liberty. As a lifelong student of our Texas history, I am excited to see the Alamo and its battlefield returned to life. So, congratulations to Land Commissioner Bush and the members of the San Antonio City Council who had the privilege, honor and yes, duty, to put their names in history as the men and women who ultimately heard the re-verberating ‘‘Remember the Alamo’’ battle cry, took action, crossed the line in the sand, to keep this beacon of Liberty forever shining in this place we call the Alamo of Texas. God and Texas. And that’s just the way it is.

HONORING REVEREND EDWARD MULRAINE’S 15TH PASTORAL AN-NIVERSARY 
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 26, 2018 Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a leader in the community who is cele-brating a tremendous anniversary at Unity Baptist Tabernacle Church in Mount Vernon. Reverend Edward Mulraine, Unity Baptist Tabernacle’s Pastor, is celebrating his 15th Anniversary leading the congregation on Octo-ber 19. The church has seen great growth in membership and the formation of various min-istries since his installation. The biggest achievement has been the elimination of a 300,000 dollars debt in less than one year. Beyond his duties at Unity Baptist Taber-nacle, Reverend Mulraine has taught Homi-letics at New York Theological Seminary from which he graduated with a Masters of Divinity. He also lectures on African American Reli-gions and The Political Philosophy of Martin Luther King, Jr. at Manhattanville College. Ed-ward Mulraine is also a graduate of Union Theological Seminary in New York with a Masters in Sacred Theology. Reverend Mulraine is also the former Presi-dent of the Williamsbridge Branch of the NAACP and Vice-President of the New York State Conference of NAACP Branches where he was instrumental in creating the National NAACP Get Out the Vote Plan for 2000 and 2004. He is married to Minister Monifa Mulraine; they have three children, Shandira, Adia and Malachi. Reverend Mulraine has accomplished a great deal for the community over the past 15 years. Congratulations to my friend on reach-ing this wonderful milestone. f 
GUN VIOLENCE 
HON. ROBIN L. KELLY 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 26, 2018 Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today because Americans continue to die from gun violence. Just this week, there was a shooting in a Kroger—not even our grocery stores are safe from the scourge of gun vio-lence. For more than a year, I’ve been coming to the House Floor and reading the names of gun violence victims that this House—the Peo-ple’s House—has failed by our inability to act and save lives. To date, I’ve read more than 2,300 names into the R
ECORD . Each one of them, was someone’s mother, son, brother, wife, cousin or friend. Every one of them was an American failed by Congress. Mr. Speaker, today, I want to recognize gun violence victims from five Congressional dis-tricts in North Carolina, Florida, Arizona and Kentucky and Michigan. Therefore, I include in the R
ECORD the names of 222 Americans who’ve been shot— many of whom were killed. Yet, still this House stands silent.

HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 26, 2018 Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Barbara Hankins as a woman of the year. She has devoted herself to the selfless service of others. She began her career as a school nurse in 1988 and began her path to becoming an important force for positive change in Colusa Unified School District. Throughout the years, Ms. Hankins has served the students and families of Colusa County with fairness and dedication, proving her willingness and ability to provide quality and exceptional service. In addition to her work as a school nurse, Ms. Hankins has served as a steadfast supporter, volunteer, and organizer for various anti-drug groups and programs. Since 1994 she has been an advi-sor for the Four Seasons anti-tobacco and anti-drug group where her selflessness has al-lowed her to connect deeply with the commu-nity youth, including non-traditional and under-served students. By implementing Red Ribbon Week campaigns throughout the school dis-trict, Ms. Hankins has led the fight against drug abuse, in large part by consistently advo-cating for her students to become the change they wish to see. She has consistently sup-ported her students along their journey of self- discovery by helping them find their talents and value their self-worth. In this way, every student, mentor, and fellow volunteer who knows her can attest to her zeal for making every individual feel cared for. Even during the floods near her residence in Meridian, Ms. Hankins’ first response was to work to ensure the safety, security, and comfort of those around her. HONORING THE NEW HAMPSHIRE PRESERVATION ALLIANCE HON. ANN M. KUSTER 
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 26, 2018 Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the New Hampshire Preservation Alliance. For years, the New Hampshire Preservation Alliance has worked to transform the future of our state by protecting our history and our cul-ture. They have saved barns in our country-side, Main Street communities in our valleys, and preserved countless historic locations. I am so grateful for the benefits our community has reaped from the stewardship, rehabilita-tion, and restoration efforts of the New Hamp-shire Preservation Alliance. On behalf of my constituents across New Hampshire’s Second Congressional District, I want to thank the New Hampshire Preserva-tion Alliance for all they have done to preserve the integrity of our Granite State. I look for-ward to our continued work together.

HONORING PAUL BOUDREAU, PRESIDENT, MORRIS COUNTY CHAMBER OF COMMERCE 
HON. RODNEY P. FRELINGHUYSEN 
OF NEW JERSEY  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 26, 2018 Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Paul Boudreau on the occasion of his retirement after 10 years as President of the Morris County Chamber of Commerce, lo-cated in the Borough of Florham Park, County of Morris, New Jersey. Paul A. Boudreau is a graduate of the Uni-versity of New Hampshire in Durham. After re-ceiving his Masters Degree at the University of Maine, he ran successfully for the Maine House of Representatives in 1976 and 1978. Paul also worked for Scott Paper Company, after his two legislative terms, as Manager of Public Affairs, New England Region. In 1983, he joined Allied Corporation (Hon-eywell) and moved to Detroit, Michigan as manager, government and public affairs, for company operations in six mid-western states. In 1996, he returned to Morris Township, New Jersey, as Director of State Government Rela-tions. In this capacity, he was responsible for state and local government relations in North America. He also served for six years as Ex-ecutive Director of the Honeywell Foundation and was a member of the company’s Political Action Committee Board for ten years. During his career at Honeywell, he worked on busi-ness-critical issues covering twenty-five states. He retired as Vice President of State and Cor-porate Relations after twenty-five years with the company. Paul joined the Chamber in the summer of 2008. He has led the effort to grow the organi-zation from 660 members in 2008 to 840 today. Under his leadership the chamber’s Economic Development Corporation is pro-viding value added services to organizations to retain and growing jobs in Morris County. He has served in leadership roles with a num-ber of state and local organizations including

the New Jersey Business & Industry Associa-tion; the Chemical Industry Council of New Jersey; United Way of Morris County; the Community Soup Kitchen; the Morris County Airport Advisory Committee; the Somerset Hills YMCA and other organizations. In 2012, Paul was nominated by Governor Chris Christie and confirmed by the New Jer-sey State Senate to serve with six other com-missioners on the Public Employment Rela-tions Commission (PERC). PERC is a state administrative agency charged with admin-istering the New Jersey Employer-Employee Relations Act. The agency deals with certain labor relations issues involving public employ-ers, public employees, and unions that rep-resent public employees. Paul is a strong team player with a proven track record of successfully working with cross functional teams, and worked closely with Chamber staff, Cabinet members and general membership. His leadership has been invalu-able to New Jersey and to the preservation and expansion of Picatinny Arsenal in Rock-away Township, and multiple programs that serve active duty servicemen and women, their families, and veterans. Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and our col-leagues join me in congratulating Paul on the occasion of his retirement from the Morris County Chamber of Commerce.

HONORING RICHARD DAVIDIAN 
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 26, 2018 Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, the Pelham com-munity of which I represent is very fortunate to have so many active and involved members working to improve the neighborhood. One of those individuals, Richard Davidian, has had an especially impactful role for students in Pelham’s exceptional school system. A long-time Pelham Civic Member and Offi-cer, Rich, as he is better known, created and chaired one of the most successful programs in Pelham Civics’ history—Help a Child, Change A Life Student Development Initiative. This revolutionary program focuses on stu-dents (K–12) from economically challenged households providing access to learning tools and skill development programs designed to move them closer to their true potential. Noth-ing like this had been done before, and the program rapidly grew across the entire district touching all the schools and grades. The results were unprecedented—Elemen-tary school students who were performing far below benchmark, were now performing at benchmark; Middle school and high school students who were failing multiple classes were now passing, and some were achieving honors, and high honor roll; Students were now attending advanced placement courses, and college courses. Rich was honored by the Board of Education with the Thomas B. Fenlon Award, which was usually given to re-tiring Board of Education members. In addition, Rich chaired the Pelham Civics Good Neighbors Program for 12 years, where his exemplary diligence and attention to detail, combined with his compassion and commit-ment, was a tremendous source of comfort and hope. Rich is a Retired Partner of a global consulting firm where he was a recognized thought leader in marketing and sales strat-egy. He and his wife Sona take great pride in their three daughters, two sons-in-law and first grandchild. Rich is honored as humanitarian, visionary, and exemplary Pelham Civic. It is no wonder then why the Civics have decided to honor Rich at their 2018 Dinner Dance. He is most deserving of the recognition. I want to con-gratulate Rich on this wonderful honor and thank him for all he has accomplished on be-half of Pelham and its residents. f 
CONGRATULATING CHARLES DAVID WOODBURN 
HON. STENY H. HOYER 
OF MARYLAND  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 26, 2018 Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratu-late Charles David Woodburn, Jr. on his retire-ment on November 2 after thirty-four years of distinguished service to this House. Charles David ‘‘Dave’’ Woodburn, Jr. was first hired by former Clerk of the House Donn Anderson in September 1984 as a Sales Clerk in the Office Supply Store. He moved through the ranks of Special Order Clerk, Purchasing Department, to Inventory Control Specialist from 1984–2002. When the Chief Administra-tive Office underwent a reorganization, Dave joined the furniture organization. Dave has always been recognized as a dili-gent and hard worker, with a strong work ethic. In the furniture organization he held many positions, including Supervisor and Man-ager for Receiving and Warehousing. Eventu-ally, he was asked to serve as the Director of the Logistics and Distribution Department. This department was expanded to include Receiv-ing and Warehousing, Logistics and Distribu-tion, and Workflow Management. In addition to these duties, since 2008, Dave has played an integral role in the Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BCDR) team with the U.S. House of Representatives. His official title is Capability Manager, responsible for providing logistical support and furniture needs for all House emergency preparedness activities. One notable contribution that Dave made to the House was his participation in the October 17, 2001 ‘‘Response Project’’ related to the anthrax incident on Capitol Hill. All Members, Committees, and Staff were able to be relo-cated to an alternate location, and Dave and his team were responsible for all logistical as-pects of this project. He was commended for his contribution to this effort while ensuring that the business of the House went forward unhindered. Dave and his team have also been at the forefront of the Cannon Renewal Project since 2013. He received the CAO Knowledge Award, presented by Chief Admin-istrative Officer Jay Eagan in 2007, for his ex-tensive knowledge of the House and its oper-ations. Dave plans to spend his retirement years with his still very active parents, his wife of fourteen years, Marie, and his six children and ten grandchildren. He has said how much he is looking forward to returning to his home-town of Leonardtown, in Maryland’s Fifth Dis-trict, where he was born and raised, after a long and storied career with the House of Representatives. Just as important as the work he performed over the years, Dave passed along his extensive logistics and fur-niture experience to his staff and coworkers as a mentor. On behalf of the entire House, I congratu-late Dave for his many years of dedication and outstanding contributions to this institution. I wish him many wonderful years of fulfillment with family and community in his retirement. f 
HONORING JOHN H. DIRZIUS ON THE OCCASION OF HIS RETIRE-MENT 
HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO 
OF CONNECTICUT  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 26, 2018 Ms. D
ELAURO. Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to rise today to join the many family, friends, and colleagues who have gath-ered to extend my heartfelt congratulations to my dear friend, John H. Dirzius, as he marks his retirement from the American Postal Work-ers Union. In his nearly fifty years of union service, John has been a strong advocate for his members. His commitment and dedication have made a difference for thousands of work-ing families and I have no doubt his leadership will be missed. John began his postal career in the Post Of-fice of Seymour, Connecticut in 1970. As one might remember, the 1970’s were a trans-formative time in our culture with a number of unique fashion and hair trends for both men and women. Just two years into his postal ca-reer, John was issued a notice of removal for having, in the opinion of the local Postmaster, ‘‘long hair.’’ Taking issue with the ‘‘reasoning’’ behind the notice for removal, John sought to file a union grievance and soon learned that working in such a small office did not offer the greatest of union representation. Eventually, John filed an EEOC complaint and won his job back—and it was this incident that marked the start of his 46-year career in the postal union. In his earliest years, John played a major role in the merging of Seymour’s small Local with that of the larger Local in New Haven, creating what would be the first of many Area Locals in the newly merged American Postal Workers Union. In 1973, John was appointed as a union organizer and within a few years, the New Haven Area Local was well on its way to becoming one of the largest in the APWU. Never forgetting his early roots as a postal worker in Seymour, John steadily rose through the ranks, serving in various leader-ship positions within the Local and State APWU. He served for over two decades as the President of the Greater Connecticut Area Local, representing postal workers employed in more than two-hundred facilities throughout the state, before his appointment as the North-east Regional Coordinator—a position in which he has served for the last eight years. John’s commitment to the labor movement has extended far beyond the APWU. He has been an active member of the AFL–CIO, once serving as a State Federation Vice-President, he is a past Vice-President of the Greater New Haven CT Labor Council and has volun-teered as a community mediator. In addition to all of this, John has also found the time to vol-unteer his time with numerous civic and youth

organizations including the United Way of Greater New Haven. I have had the great honor of knowing and working with John for close to thirty years and I have been proud to stand with him in the fight to preserve his members’ jobs as well as the health and retirement benefits they have earned. I would be remiss if I did not extend a personal note of thanks to him for his many years of friendship and support. He has been an extraordinary friend and his fierce commit-ment and dedication is an inspiration to all of us who have been fortunate enough to work with him. The retirement of John H. Dirzius from the American Postal Workers Union marks the end of an era. I am honored to have this op-portunity to stand and extend my deepest thanks and sincere appreciation to John for his outstanding service and unwavering com-mitment to our working families. I wish him; his wife, Diane; their children, Melisa, Jeffrey, and Gregory; and the apples of their eyes, their grandchildren, Makayla, Jacob, Tatiana, and Benjamin, all the best for many more years of health and happiness. Congratula-tions my friend—Auguroni.

HONORING MARY LYNN ROPER 
HON. BEN RAY LUJA´N 
OF NEW MEXICO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 26, 2018 Mr. BEN RAY LUJA´N of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I rise in honor of Mary Lynn Roper. Mary Lynn has been a force for good in our community. She has blazed a trail for so many aspiring journalists in New Mexico. Generations of young people will look to the example she set not only in her professional field, but also in the way she gave back to the community. Mary Lynn was instrumental in the launch of ‘‘KOATS for Kids,’’ a clothing drive that helps children in New Mexico stay warm in the winters, and she spearheaded the ‘‘School Supply’’ program for schools and stu-dents in our region. Her decades of service in the newsroom at KOAT have also made a tremendous impact. She ensured that the stories of the people of New Mexico were told and her legacy in the field of journalism will be lasting. I want to personally congratulate Mary Lynn Roper on her retirement and thank her for her service in New Mexico. I have no doubt that she will continue to make a difference in whatever the next adven-ture brings.

HONORING ANOOSH JORJORIAN WITH CALIFORNIA’S THIRD DIS-TRICT WOMAN OF THE YEAR AWARD 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 26, 2018 Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Anoosh Jorjorian as a woman of the year. She is the coordinator of Yolo Rainbow Families, a support group for families with gender nonconforming children. In her role as coordinator, she advocates for policies that create identity safe-spaces at schools for chil-dren who identify as LGBTQ+. Committed to serving her community, she devotes a sub-stantial amount of her time to help nurture inclusivity and awareness in Yolo County. De-spite being a relative newcomer to Davis, Ms. Jorjorian quickly became involved in social justice issues from LGBTQ+ to immigrant rights, also founding Davis’ local LGBTQ+ youth group. Consistently a visible presence at school board meetings, she has also been in-tegral in organizing gender identity sensitivity trainings for the City of Davis’ Parks and Recreation Department all while being a pas-sionate advocate for better pay for teachers. She was instrumental in forming Safe in Yolo, a community group that helped author a coun-ty resolution declaring Yolo County a safe and welcoming place. Additionally, Ms. Jorjorian has been a regular speaker as a devoted member of the Davis Phoenix Coalition, a community group that is dedicated to pre-venting hate-motivated violence. Ms. Jorjorian is a dedicated community activist who never backs away from doing what is necessary to make our community a safer place. You can find her at community events, speaking at public meetings, or organizing for the next ef-fort to move Davis forward; she has a heart of service that is clearly and consistently dem-onstrated by her activism in our community. f 
STATE DEPARTMENT IS COVERING FOR IRAN’S PROXIES 
HON. TED POE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 26, 2018 Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, Iran’s net-work of terrorist proxies continues to expand across the Middle East. Wherever there is conflict and division, a militant group backed by Iran can be found. They have become powerful political and military actors in weak states because Tehran provides the money and weapons for them to murder and intimi-date their way into power. But what are we, the United States of Amer-ica, doing about it? For one thing, we have fi-nally re-applied sanctions on Iran after the ter-rible nuclear deal allowed these proxies to go well-funded and unchallenged. This allows us to target finances of the primary patron for chaos in the Middle East: Iran. But on the local level, in the multiple arenas where Tehran and its proxies are battling for control we are doing very little. Our own State Depart-ment has blocked any aggressive effort that would target some of Iran’s most capable proxies. Why? One of the most important arenas for com-peting against Iran’s growing influence is in Iraq. That nation has seen nearly two decades of war, most recently with the fight against ISIS. Iran has exploited Iraq’s chaos to raise several proxies that have killed Americans and Iraqis. While one of Tehran’s earliest Iraqi proxies, Kataib Hezbollah, was designated as a foreign terrorist organization in 2009, others have operated with impunity. This includes two of the Iran’s most powerful proxies: Asa’ib Ahl al-Haq (AAH) and Harakat Hezbollah al- Nujaba (HHN). In recent years these two mili-tias have been the vanguard of Iran’s activities in the region, including sowing sectarian divi-sion in Iraq and fighting on behalf of the butcher Bashar al-Assad in Syria. Yet when I introduced legislation that would designate AAH and HHN for terrorism—which nearly every expert agrees they are com-plicate in—the State Department has worked to shield these groups. U.S. Embassy staff in Baghdad was very dismissive of this legisla-tion and ridiculed it. It seems to me that the embassy is ignorant of the threat of these groups that have American blood on their hands. Even one of these terrorist groups at-tacked the embassy after the embassy op-posed the terrorist designation. Meanwhile, these groups have seized 15 seats in Iraq’s parliament. So what has the state department accomplished other than obstruct Congres-sional lawmaking? Iraq is closer to being an Iranian client-state than ever before. The State Department should not join in with Iran and oppose this legislation. President Trump has made clear that con-fronting Iranian expansionism is a key priority of his administration. But the State Depart-ment has instead adopted a strategy to protect Iran’s proxies and undermine the American legislative process. We need our diplomats to be sending a strong signal that terrorist militias acting on behalf of Iran must not be taking power in Iraq. Now is a critical time in that country, with the Iraqi people in the streets de-manding Iran out of their country. America should be standing with them, not with the Mullahs and their thugs. And that’s just the way it is. f 
HONORING MANUEL PADILLA 
HON. VICENTE GONZALEZ 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 26, 2018 Mr. GONZALEZ of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. Manuel Padilla, Jr., on the occasion of his recent promotion. Mr. Padilla has been chosen to serve as the Di-rector of the Joint Task Force West, Depart-ment of Homeland Security. For more than 30 years, Mr. Padilla has served in the U.S. Border Patrol, working to create safer and more secure border commu-nities. Most recently, he served as the Chief Patrol Agent of the Rio Grande Valley Border Patrol Sector and the Commander of the Joint Task Force-West, South Texas Corridor. Chief Padilla’s dedication and determination will be greatly missed but I know he will continue to protect our communities, and our country as a whole, in his new position. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to represent someone as hard-working as Mr. Manuel Padilla, Jr. The South Texas community is thankful for his dedication not only to our country but also to border communities like ours. I wish him the best as he begins a new chapter of his life and thank him for his time.

to work hard for the greater good. The Pelham community which I represent has no doubt been strengthened by the work of Kathie O’Callaghan, who has done so much not just to help her fellow Pelham residents, but also people from all over the world. A Pelhamite for over 30 years, Kathie is a visionary who has broken conventional bar-riers and applied her talents to a wide range of charitable causes that have truly made a difference. Kathie’s most recent accomplish-ment is being the Founder & President of Hearts and Homes for Refugees, an innova-tive grassroots non-profit that supports U.S. Department of State designated agencies in welcoming, protecting and advocating for refu-gees resettling in U.S. communities. Inspired by the crisis in Syria, Kathie created a group to advocate for resettlement in Westchester County. HHR is now comprised of 400 volun-teers that welcomed the first refugee family to Westchester County: a Syrian family of six that was resettled in Pelham. In 2018, Kathie led HHR in creating the Westchester Refugee Initiative, a county-wide coalition to support and grow the network of over 20 community and interfaith organizations and 1,500 individ-uals who support the welcoming movement in Westchester. Under Kathie’s leadership, the Westchester Refugee Initiative’s volunteers continue to welcome and advocate for new refugee arrivals and supports refugees who are already in the country and need of help. Beyond her incredible work with refugees, Kathie has also been an integral part of the formation of the Friends of the Pelham Library; a Member of the Rotary Club of the Pelham; an In-Home Hospice Volunteer at Jansen Hos-pice & Palliative Care; a Pelham Manor Volun-teer Firefighter; a Member of the leadership team of Huguenot Memorial Church; a Lector at Our Lady of Perpetual Help Church; and was an honoree at the 2017 Pelham Woman of Distinction event. Kathie has done it all, and the work she has done in Pelham is nothing short of inspira-tional. This year, the Pelham Civics are hon-oring Kathie at their 2018 Dinner. They could not have picked a more deserving honoree. Congratulations to Kathie O’Callaghan on this tremendous honor.

TRIBUTE TO HONOR THE LIFE OF BARBARA HAYMS WEISS 
HON. ANNA G. ESHOO 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 26, 2018 Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of a remarkable woman, Barbara Hayms Weiss, who was born on March 15, 1931 in Chicago and passed away on July 21, 2018, in Palo Alto, California. She was pre-deceased by her beloved husband, Paul. Barbara and Paul lived in Los Altos Hills and Palo Alto where they raised three chil-dren. They supported Jewish causes, arts or-ganizations, and Democrats, especially women candidates. Barbara earned her B.A. in Sociology from San Jose State University in 1976 at the age of 45. She then completed her M.S.W. with a focus on gerontology in 1981 from U.C. Berke-ley. She worked at Little House in Menlo Park and joined Paul’s auto dealership, Key Chev-rolet, as a Dealer-Academy trained potential successor, and helped run the agency until they sold the business in 1988. Barbara was also Board President of the Jewish Commu-nity Center of Palo Alto. Barbara and Paul moved from their large home in Los Altos Hills to a condominium in Palo Alto, where they continued, via their Donor Advised Fund at the San Francisco Jewish Federation, to support causes that were important to them. They enjoyed fre-quent trips to Santa Fe, New Mexico for the Opera and SWAIA Indian Market, where they collected stunningly beautiful Pueblo pottery. According to Barbara’s son Mark, his par-ents ‘‘just wanted America to continue to give opportunities that they got and wanted to back the right people to accomplish that.’’ Barbara leaves her son Mark Weiss of Palo Alto and his wife Terry Acebo Davis; Linda Weiss Moulding of San Carlos and her hus-band Mark Moulding, Rick and Nancy Weiss of Los Altos Hills, and her grandchildren Aaron and Jon Lipinski of San Carlos. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the life of Barbara Weiss, a patriot, a mother and a highly accomplished woman. I will always miss her, as will all those who were privileged to know her and admire the values she lived out so faithfully over a life-time. f 
HONORING SISTERS’ JOURNEY AS THEY CELEBRATE THEIR 20TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO 
OF CONNECTICUT  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 26, 2018 Ms. D
ELAURO. Mr. Speaker, it is my great privilege to rise today to extend my heartfelt congratulations to Sisters’ Journey as they mark the 20th anniversary of this remarkable organization. A faith-based breast cancer sup-port and advocacy group, Sisters’ Journey began as a personal journey and continues today as a labor of love. After being diagnosed with breast cancer, Linda White-Epps felt the fear and frustration so many do when facing breast cancer. She knew she needed to heal not only her body but her soul and searched for others who could relate to what she was experiencing. It was through this search that she educated herself on the disease as well as the health disparities that existed. African-American women are statistically more likely to die from breast cancer than other ethnic groups and they are diagnosed at younger ages and often with a more aggressive form of the disease. Linda also met more women than she ever imagined that were experiencing similar jour-neys and that there was an unspoken but agreed to code of silence that needed to be broken. It was from all this that Sisters’ Jour-ney was born. Linda began with a calendar created to break the silence among women of color with twelve women sharing their stories of hope and survival. Twenty years later, nearly two- hundred and fifty courageous women have given hope and inspiration to women and their families facing a breast cancer diagnosis. Sis-ters’ Journey has grown and become an in-valuable resource of support and advocacy. Monthly support groups meetings are held at a church parish hall; events include annual survivor cook-outs, a Christmas Party, and a Mother/Daughter ‘‘know your family history’’ brunch; and educational outreach programs in-clude beauty shop chats, participation in com-munity parades, as well as school programs for children from elementary through college. And, of course, there is the annual Pink Tea, an event which has grown to include hundreds of family, friends, and supporters, where the annual calendar is revealed. Linda White-Epps survived for twelve years before succumbing to a recurrence in 2003. Sisters’ Journey and her legacy was carried on by her mother, Phyllis White, until her passing in 2010. Today, it is Linda’s daughter, Dawn White-Bracey, who carries on this labor of love. The celebration of Sisters’ Journey’s 20th calendar is not only a wonderful mile-stone for this incredible organization, but a celebration of the on-going legacy of Linda White-Epps and her remarkable journey. I consider myself fortunate to have known and worked with Linda, Phyllis, and now Dawn, and I am honored to call them friends. It is with the greatest admiration and my heartfelt congratulations that I rise today to extend Dawn and the Sisters’ Journey family my very best wishes as they celebrate this very special occasion. f 
HONORING THE 125TH ANNIVER-SARY OF OLIVE BRANCH BAP-TIST CHURCH IN PORTSMOUTH, VIRGINIA 
HON. ROBERT C. ‘‘BOBBY’’ SCOTT 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 26, 2018 Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 125th anniversary of Olive Branch Baptist Church in Portsmouth, Virginia. Olive Branch Baptist Church was formed in 1893 when a small group of parishioners sep-arated from Zion Baptist Church and formed Zion’s Chapel. Under the leadership of Dr. John Armistead, Zion’s Chapel was estab-lished in a nearby facility called Copeland’s Hall and attracted worshippers two Sundays each month. By 1897, membership had grown so large that a new and larger location was necessary. With assistance from their mother church, Zion Baptist Church, Zion’s Chapel was able to pur-chase an older sanctuary, previously known as Olive Branch Methodist Church. With the guidance of Reverend H.W. Chiles, the new church was renamed Olive Branch Baptist Church. It is impossible to commemorate the 125th anniversary of this historic church without rec-ognizing former pastors. Reverend H.W. Chiles served as the first pastor of Olive Branch Baptist Church. Under his leadership, the Sunday School, the Home Mission Circle and the Senior Choir was established. In 1905, Dr. H. L. Barco took the helm. Dur-ing his 11-year tenure, the church did very well financially and was able to pay off the church’s mortgage. In addition, he organized the Foreign Mission Circle and the Senior Usher Board. Olive Branch Baptist Church’s first male auxiliary was established in 1918 when Rev-erend A. S. Hoard was installed as the third

pastor. The auxiliary was responsible for in-stalling the bell that still sits inside the belfry today. Despite the absence of a pastor from 1926 to 1928, Olive Branch Baptist Church contin-ued to grow. During these years, the church purchased land adjacent to the church grounds to serve as a parking lot and ceme-tery. Beginning in 1928, Reverend J.W. Shaffer served as Shepherd of the flock. During his five-year tenure, Olive Branch Baptist Church continued to attract local residents and spread the good word of God. Reverend Lamar Sharp served as the fifth pastor of Olive Branch Baptist Church. He was a resident of Norfolk, Virginia, and traveled to preach on the first and third Sunday of every month for 27 years. Due to poor health, Rev-erend Sharp retired in 1963 and his nephew, Reverend James Benjamin Sharp, was cho-sen as the sixth pastor of Olive Branch Baptist Church. During Reverend James Sharp’s pastorate, on January 5, 1986, Olive Branch Baptist Church suffered a fire. God’s grace provided that little damage occurred to the sanctuary, however the congregation was forced to relo-cate to another church during the four-month repair. Reverend James Sharp retired on Decem-ber 31, 2000, after serving 37 years. Upon his retirement, the members of Olive Branch Bap-tist Church presented him with the honorary title of Pastor Emeritus. From 2001 until 2003, Olive Branch Baptist Church was once again without a pastor. However, after a three-year search, the pulpit Search Committee chose Reverend Ernest L. Reid as their seventh pastor. He was Olive Branch Baptist Church’s youngest pastor and gave new life to the mission of the church. Olive Branch Baptist Church’s current pastor is Reverend Michael L. Williams. Reverend Williams was installed on March 30, 2014 and is the eighth pastor in Olive Branch Baptist Church’s 125 years of service to the Ports-mouth community. His vision for the church is simple—Bridge the Past; Bless the Present; Build the Future. Over the four years that he has served as pastor, Reverend Williams has revitalized the Men’s Ministry and Nursing Ministry and formed the Women’s, Culinary and Mentoring Ministries. Through these orga-nizations, Reverend Williams, along with Olive Branch Baptist Church’s congregation, is con-tinuing to build a church that worships, wit-nesses and serves with a spirit of excellence. Mr. Speaker, as Olive Branch Baptist Church celebrates this historic milestone, its congregation can take pride in an inspiring 125 years of fellowship, worship and service. I would like to congratulate Reverend Michael L. Williams and all the members of the church’s congregation on this joyous occasion, and I wish them many more years full of growth and prosperity.

GIRL SCOUTS ARE TODAY’S LEADERS—SUSAN SOH 
HON. TED POE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 26, 2018 Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, there are three important traits that leaders young and old should have: courage, confidence, and character. The three C’s is a good name for them. These traits are the foundation of what the 2.6 million Girl Scouts worldwide use to make a difference. Out of the 2.6 million girls and adults, there are 1.8 million girls, and thousands are chosen every year as Gold Award Girl Scouts for their dedication to im-proving the communities that they serve. Out of these thousands of girls, only ten young leaders are chosen as National Gold Award Girl Scouts. This honorable distinction is re-served for those girls who have taken an idea and turned into concrete results that will have effects on the local, national, and global lev-els. Well Mr. Speaker, part of the district I rep-resent in Houston, Texas happens to be home to a recently awarded National Gold Award Girl Scout, Susan Soh. Susan is helping to change the lives of others around the world with her Gold Award project, Leer a Mi (Read to Me). Susan learned of children in Guate-mala who spoke only their local Mayan dialect, and not the official language of Spanish. Be-cause of the language barrier, children were struggling with literacy in upon entering pri-mary school. After recognizing this was a seri-ous issue, Susan answered the call to action. Life changing effects have been made for children in Guatemala thanks to Susan’s ef-forts and her partnership with Guatemala SANA. By bringing in Spanish speakers to record audiobooks, building a library, and cre-ating language programs, almost no stone has been left unturned to help the local children excel in their schooling. Real results have been made in the community. Over 400 children visit the library every month and are scoring above their reading levels when they enter primary school. Be-cause of the success of this idea turned to ac-tionable plan, Susan has made sure the re-sults continue for years to come. Susan, along with the other National Gold Award Girl Scouts, were recognized this month at the United Nations in New York City. I applaud her for answering the call to action. She has demonstrated true leadership with the three C’s at the forefront of her efforts: cour-age, confidence, and character. Her work as a Girls Scout shows that she is a leader in our city, state, country, and around the globe. And that’s just the way it is. f 
EDMUND A. WALENS, JR. 
HON. DONALD NORCROSS 
OF NEW JERSEY  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 26, 2018 Mr. NORCROSS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Staff Sargent Edmund A. Walens, Jr., of Gloucester City, New Jersey for his service to our nation. Edmund A. Walens, Jr. was a graduate of Gloucester High School. He then, entered the United States Air Force in June, l952. He was unable to finish the basic training due to the Korean War, the Airforce needed Aircraft Me-chanics and he was immediately transferred to the Shepard Air Force Base in Wichita Falls, Texas. He served at Savannah Georgia refueling planes, then the 307 Bomb Wing, Okinawa Is-land, in Japan. In 1953, the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed, this ended the Korean War. After ending the war Mr. Walens was as-signed to the 98th Bomb Wing and shipped statewide though his time he served in New York, Texas, and then he received an honor-able discharge in 1960 in Lincoln, Nebraska. Mr. Walens has been married for sixty years and has four children. Additionally, he served as a volunteer firefighter for nine and a half years and was in the New Jersey National Guard for fourteen years, receiving an honor-able discharge in 1991. Mr. Walens also was the overseer in de-signing the Veterans of Foreign Wars Post No. 3620, Donald ‘‘Doc’’ Doherty Veterans Mu-seum. The museum has artifacts that date back to the 1600’s, and has been around for the community’s enjoyment for fourteen years. Mr. Speaker, Edmund A. Walens, Jr. is the living embodiment of the ‘‘Greatest Genera-tion.’’ I ask you to join me in saluting and thanking him for his service to our country. f 
HONORING FIRST BAPTIST CHURCH 165TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 26, 2018 Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I want to take a moment to recognize a spiritual institution in my district that this year is celebrating its re-markable 165th anniversary. First Baptist Church in Bronxville is a warm, friendly community of Christians comprised of people with a diversity of cultural and racial backgrounds. First Baptist is a Christ-centered Church that seeks to relate Biblical messages to contemporary practical life experience. As a member of the American Baptist Churches, USA, the church is also affiliated with the American Baptist Churches of Metropolitan New York. The First Baptist Church was organized in 1854 as The First Baptist Church of Mount Vernon and was located for eighty years on the corner of Second Avenue and Second Street in Mount Vernon. In 1970 the congrega-tion chose to move to our present location, 407 New Rochelle Road because of its central location, convenient to the nearby towns and villages where most of our members live— Bronxville, Crestwood, Eastchester, Mount Vernon, New Rochelle, Pelham, Tuckahoe, and Yonkers. The beautiful modern church building houses the Sanctuary which can accommo-date more than 300 people, and The Fellow-ship Hall which is used for the Sunday Church Coffee Hour, special church programs and conferences, church dinners, socials and Youth meetings and activities. The contributions made by First Baptist Church and its congregation to our community for 165 years cannot be over stated. I want to congratulate Reverend Lamont Granby and the entire First Baptist family on this wonderful occasion.

HONORING BONNIE MINTUN WITH CALIFORNIA’S THIRD DISTRICT WOMAN OF THE YEAR AWARD 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 26, 2018 Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Bonnie Mintun as a woman of the year. She has been a lifetime advocate for children with disabilities in her community. She was one of a small group of parents and teachers in her community of Davis who pushed the Davis Joint Unified School District to provide adequate education for children with disabilities. In 1989, thanks in large part to her work, Davis Joint Unified School District became the first school district in California to provide inclusive education to students with moderate to severe disabilities. This accom-plishment alone demonstrates the lasting im-pact that Ms. Mintun has had on her commu-nity, but her work to improve education for those with disabilities did not stop with her first success. Ten years ago, she co-founded the Communication Technology Education Center, a non-profit organization aimed at connecting individuals with communication challenges to assistive technology and augmented alter-native communication devices. Through this work, her organization helps people of all abili-ties to communicate, thus helping foster a more inclusive society. Beyond her many ac-complishments, Ms. Mintun lends her time and expertise to many advisory committees that support individuals with intellectual, develop-mental, and physical disabilities. Her most re-cent effort is ensuring that inclusive, universal design principles are adopted as guidelines in designing the new Downtown Davis Specific Plan. Ms. Mintun is an inspiration to parents, teachers, and community members looking to make our community inclusive to people of all abilities.
