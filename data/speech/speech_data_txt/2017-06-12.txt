ALZHEIMER’S AND BRAIN AWARENESS MONTH (Mr. BILIRAKIS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, June is Alzheimer’s and Brain Awareness Month. Alzheimer’s is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States, impact-ing more than 500,000 people in Florida, and 5 million Americans nationwide. It is also the only top 10 cause of death in America that cannot be prevented or cured. Beyond the statistics, finding treat-ments and cures for Alzheimer’s is a deeply personal mission to so many people, including myself. In Florida, the Byrd Alzheimer’s In-stitute at USF is one of the largest freestanding institutes dedicated to Alzheimer’s research in the Nation. Their work brings us closer to cures and treatments every day. We are also making great strides in the fight against Alzheimer’s with the 21st Century Cures Act. This historic, nonpartisan legislation, which was signed into law late last year, creates a national data collection system for neurological diseases. Better data will pave the path forward to better treat-ments. f 
PULSE NIGHTCLUB SHOOTING ANNIVERSARY (Mr. DEUTCH asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, ‘‘There will never be an end.’’ That is how Emily Addison described the love and the loss she feels for her partner and the mother of her son, Deonka Drayton. Deonka was one of 49 victims killed at Pulse Nightclub in Orlando 1 year ago today. She was one of hundreds who had gone to Pulse that night as a place of celebration, a place of joy, and a place of pride. We mark 1 year since the worst mass shooting in our history, an act of ter-ror against the LGBT community, and

we mark this somber event today dur-ing Pride Month. This day creates enormous tension for the LGBT community and its allies. Our hearts are broken for the victims and for their families. We are angry, we are frustrated, yet we are still filled with pride. We are proud of the lives they lived, though they were cut far too short. Today, I stand with the LGBT com-munity. And together, we stand against hatred, we stand against ter-ror, and we stand for love and for pride, pride that has no end.

EXTENDING DEADLINE FOR CON-STRUCTION OF HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT NUMBERED 12737 Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 446) to extend the deadline for commencement of construction of a hydroelectric project. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 446 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-resentatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. EXTENSION. 
(a) I NGENERAL .—Notwithstanding the time period specified in section 13 of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 806) that would other-wise apply to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission project numbered 12737, the Commission may, at the request of the li-censee for the project, and after reasonable notice, in accordance with the good faith, due diligence, and public interest require-ments of that section and the Commission’s procedures under that section, extend the time period during which the licensee is re-quired to commence the construction of the project for up to 3 consecutive 2-year periods from the date of the expiration of the exten-sion originally issued by the Commission. (b) R
EINSTATEMENT OF EXPIRED LICENSE .— If the period required for commencement of construction of the project described in sub-section (a) has expired prior to the date of the enactment of this Act, the Commission may reinstate the license for the project ef-fective as of the date of its expiration and the first extension authorized under sub-section (a) shall take effect on the date of such expiration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-ant to the rule, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. U
PTON ) and the gentle-woman from Colorado (Ms. D
EGETTE ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan. 
GENERAL LEAVE  
Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I ask unan-imous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-tend their remarks and include extra-neous material on H.R. 446. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Michigan? There was no objection. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-self such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 446 authorizes the Federal Energy Regulatory Commis-sion, FERC, upon request, to extend by 6 years the time period during which construction must commence on the Gathright Hydroelectric Project lo-cated in Alleghany County, Virginia. Additionally, FERC may reinstate the construction license if it is expired. A similar bill was passed under sus-pension of the rules in the 114th Con-gress in a bipartisan way, and I would hope that we can do it today. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. D
EGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 446, a bill to extend the deadline for commencement of construction of a hydroelectric project, introduced by Mr. G
RIFFITH . On March 13, 2012, FERC licensed the Gathright Hydroelectric Project to be located at the Army Corps of Engi-neers’ Gathright Dam on the Jackson River in Alleghany County, Virginia. The licensee for the Gathright project was not able to commence construction by the already-extended deadline in March 2016. The bill would, therefore, authorize FERC to extend for up to three con-secutive 2-year periods the date by which the licensee is required to com-mence construction. Similar legisla-tion passed the House of Representa-tives by voice vote twice during the last Congress. I hope everybody will support pas-sage of H.R. 446. I hope we can get this thing built. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GRIF-
FITH), a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee. Mr. GRIFFITH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 446, which would extend the construction com-mencement deadline for a hydro-electric project at the Gathright Dam in Alleghany County. Extensive coordination between the hydroelectric project developer and the Army Corps and the current difficulties in obtaining a power purchase agree-ment have necessitated this construc-tion’s start-date extension. This legislation has passed the House previously unanimously and was in-cluded in last Congress’s House com-prehensive energy bill. It is my hope that this legislation will once again re-ceive overwhelming support in this Chamber. I appreciate the support of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. Ms. D
EGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote, and I yield back the bal-ance of my time. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. U
PTON ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 446. The question was taken; and (two- thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

EXTENDING DEADLINE FOR CON-STRUCTION OF HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT NUMBERED 12740 Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 447) to extend the deadline for commencement of construction of a hydroelectric project. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 447 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-resentatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

GENERAL LEAVE  
Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I ask unan-imous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-tend their remarks and include extra-neous material on H.R. 447. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Michigan? There was no objection. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-self as much time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, this bill authorizes the Federal Energy Regulatory Commis-sion, FERC, upon request, to extend by 6 years the time period during which construction must commence on the Flannagan Dam and Reservoir Hydro-electric Project located in Dickenson County, Virginia. Additionally, FERC may reinstate the construction license if it is expired. The bill, again, passed under suspen-sion in the 114th Congress, and I would hope that we could do the same today in a bipartisan way. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. D
EGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I again rise in support of legislation by Mr. G
RIFFITH , H.R. 447, which would extend the deadline for commencement of construction of the Flannagan Hy-droelectric Project, to be located at the Army Corps of Engineers’ John W. Flannagan Dam on the Russell Fork River in Dickenson County, Virginia. The licensee for the Flannagan Hy-droelectric Project did not commence construction by the already-extended deadline in January 2016. Legislation is now required for the project to move forward. The bill would authorize FERC to ex-tend for up to three consecutive years the date by which the licensee is re-quired to commence construction. During the last Congress, the full House of Representatives passed simi-lar legislation by voice vote. I once again hope my colleagues will help me in supporting passage of H.R. 447. Let’s get this one built, too. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GRIF-
FITH), a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee. Mr. GRIFFITH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 447, which would extend the construction com-mencement deadline for a hydro-electric project at the Flannagan Dam in Dickenson County.

STREAMLINING ENERGY EFFI-CIENCY FOR SCHOOLS ACT OF 2017 Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 627) to amend the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to provide for the dissemination of information re-garding available Federal programs re-lating to energy efficiency projects for schools, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 627 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-resentatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Stream-lining Energy Efficiency for Schools Act of 2017’’. 
SEC. 2. COORDINATION OF ENERGY RETRO-FITTING ASSISTANCE FOR SCHOOLS.

Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I ask unan-imous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-tend their remarks and include extra-neous material on H.R. 627. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Michigan? There was no objection. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-self such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, this bill, H.R. 627, is an important bill that would help the Na-tion’s schools make use of existing Federal programs to actually reduce their energy use. There currently are a number of such programs that help schools undertake projects that im-prove energy efficiency. Unfortunately, school districts don’t always have the know-how to navigate the complexities

of the Federal system and take full ad-vantage of these programs. The bill creates a simple one-stop shop to get all the needed information and help school districts participate more fully in these programs. The bot-tom line is that the Nation’s schools will, in fact, reduce their energy costs. As it is, energy use in American K–12 schools totals $6 billion every year, and reducing this figure can certainly save taxpayer dollars or free up funds that schools can use on things other than energy bills. This bill, H.R. 627, has no cost since it merely sets up a system under which existing school energy efficiency pro-grams can work better. A similar bill was passed under sus-pension of the rules at the end of the last Congress, and I would hope that we can do it today, at the beginning of this Congress, so that the Senate can follow suit and get this to the Presi-dent’s desk. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. D
EGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may con-sume. Mr. Speaker, I want to voice my strong support for H.R. 627, Mr. C
ART-
WRIGHT ’s Streamlining Energy Effi-ciency for Schools Act. This is a great bill that will provide a coordinated structure for our Nation’s schools to help them better navigate available Federal programs and financing op-tions. Across the country, K–12 school dis-tricts spend literally billions of dollars on their energy bills each year while an estimated 14 million American children attend deteriorating public schools. By upgrading these systems, we can in-crease efficiency and focus school fund-ing to achieve better educational out-comes. This legislation passed the House previously with broad bipartisan sup-port, and I urge everybody to support it. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. C
ARTWRIGHT ), the author of the bill. Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the leadership and Chairman U
PTON for bringing this bill up under suspension today, and I thank the gen-tlewoman from Colorado for yielding me the time. I thank the entire Energy and Com-merce Committee, which, once again, voted unanimously in committee in favor of this bill—a bill that has passed the House twice under suspension in each of the past two Congresses. Both times it passed during the final days of the Congress, and the Senate did not have a chance to take the bill up. I am glad the House is considering it now in plenty of time for the Senate to con-sider it and act. I would also thank Congressman P
ETER WELCH from Vermont for his leadership on the bill. It is no secret that he is one of the great champions in the House on the issue of energy effi-ciency, and it has been my pleasure to work with him. Mr. Speaker, so many schools across the country are in need of upgrades and improvements to their facilities. In its most recent 2017 Infrastructure Report Card, the American Society of Civil Engineers gave the condition of our Nation’s schools a grade of D-plus. As school administrators undertake badly needed improvements, they have an opportunity to substantially im-prove their facilities’ energy efficiency, producing benefits for both the envi-ronment and the economy. In reducing their energy bills, schools can put the savings to use on other educational pri-orities. According to the EPA and the De-partment of Energy, K–12 school dis-tricts nationwide spend approximately $8 billion on their energy bills every year—second only to personnel costs— exceeding the costs of textbooks and supplies. An estimated $2 billion of that cost could be saved by improving energy efficiency, an amount that could pay for, for example, 40 million textbooks. Energy expenses are one of the few costs that can be reduced while at the same time improving classroom in-struction. In fact, high-performance schools can lower a school district’s op-erating costs by up to 30 percent. There are numerous Federal initia-tives already available to schools to help them become more energy effi-cient, but these programs are spread across the Federal Government, mak-ing it challenging, time consuming, and costly for schools to identify and take full advantage of these programs. In addition, schools can use several different general purpose programs for energy efficiency projects if they know how to locate and apply for them. Introduced in the Senate as S. 383 by Senator SUSAN COLLINS , this bipartisan Streamlining Energy Efficiency for Schools Act aims to provide a coordi-nating structure for busy school ad-ministrators to help them better navi-gate available Federal programs and fi-nancing options. This legislation does not spend an ad-ditional dime and keeps its decision-making authority with the States, the school boards, and local officials. This bill establishes a clearinghouse through the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, which will dis-seminate information on Federal pro-grams and financing mechanisms that may be used to develop energy effi-ciency, distributed generation, and en-ergy retrofitting projects for schools. The bill also directs the Office of En-ergy Efficiency and Renewable Energy to coordinate with Federal agencies and develop an outreach effort to streamline communications and pro-mote available Federal programs. Such outreach may include a single website where school officials can learn more about the relevant programs. Overburdened school administrators should not have to spend hours and hours wading through the Federal bu-reaucracy as they look for ways to im-prove energy efficiency. This common-sense legislation will ensure that schools can more easily take advantage of existing energy efficiency programs. It is a strategic and cost-saving in-vestment to relieve the fiscal pressure felt by school districts across the coun-try, supported by overburdened home-owners, while bringing us closer to en-ergy security in America. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to pass this bill. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I would urge my colleagues to support this great, bipartisan bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. DEGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. U
PTON ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 627. The question was taken; and (two- thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

Mr. Speaker, the legislation before us, sponsored by the gentlewoman from North Carolina, would authorize FERC to extend for 6 years the date by which the licensee for the W.

This is necessary because the project’s licensee was not able to commence construction by the already-extended deadline of July 17, 2016. Similar legislation authored by Ms. F
OXXpassed the House during the 114th Congress by a vote of 406–3. I hope my colleagues will support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. F
OXX). Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Michigan (Mr. U
PTON ). I rise in support of H.R. 951, a bill I authored to extend the license author-izing the Wilkesboro Hydroelectric Company’s construction of its hydro-power project at W. Kerr Scott Dam. The project has required exhaustive coordination with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and there have been delays in the review process for the de-sign plans. As the Wilkesboro Hydro-electric Company takes steps to com-ply with statutory mandates and re-quirements by Federal regulators, the shot clock for action on breaking ground dwindles. As has often hap-pened with these projects, delays in the review process and coordination efforts precluded the start of construction. I ask my colleagues to support a new authorization for this project, along with the other projects the House is considering today. Furthermore, I ap-plaud Representative MCMORRIS ROD-
GERS and the House Energy and Com-merce Committee for working on com-prehensive reform legislation to ad-dress the statutory framework and FERC processes pertaining to these projects. I am a proud supporter of our Na-tion’s renewable energy resources. Con-gress should optimize the use of our Nation’s clean, renewable hydropower potential by bringing regulatory and permitting certainty to the process. Given North Carolina’s growth and demand for electricity, my State needs Congress to explore every opportunity to meet our energy demands, provide for job growth, and sustain our envi-ronment. As chair of the Education and the Workforce Committee, I will work tirelessly with the other committees in the House and the Trump administra-tion to achieve this. I thank Chairman W
ALDEN , Majority Leader M
CCARTHY , and former Chair-man U
PTON for bringing this important legislation to the floor. Ms. D
EGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, this is im-portant legislation, and I would like to think that we can pass it again this afternoon. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. U

FEDERAL POWER ACT AMENDMENT Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1109) to amend section 203 of the Federal Power Act. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 1109 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-resentatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. CLARIFICATION OF FACILITY MERG-ER AUTHORIZATION. 
Section 203(a)(1)(B) of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 824b(a)(1)(B)) is amended by striking ‘‘such facilities or any part thereof’’ and inserting ‘‘such facilities, or any part thereof, of a value in excess of $10,000,000’’. 
SEC. 2. NOTIFICATION FOR CERTAIN TRANS-ACTIONS. 
Section 203(a) of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 824b(a)) is amended by adding at the end the following new paragraph: ‘‘(7)(A) Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this paragraph, the Commission shall promulgate a rule requir-ing any public utility that is seeking to merge or consolidate, directly or indirectly, its facilities subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission, or any part thereof, with those of any other person, to notify the Com-mission of such transaction not later than 30 days after the date on which the transaction is consummated if— ‘‘(i) such facilities, or any part thereof, are of a value in excess of $1,000,000; and ‘‘(ii) such public utility is not required to secure an order of the Commission under paragraph (1)(B). ‘‘(B) In establishing any notification re-quirement under subparagraph (A), the Com-mission shall, to the maximum extent prac-ticable, minimize the paperwork burden re-sulting from the collection of information.’’. SEC. 3. EFFECTIVE DATE. 
The amendment made by section 1 shall take effect 180 days after the date of enact-ment of this Act. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-ant to the rule, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. U
PTON ) and the gentle-woman from Colorado (Ms. D
EGETTE ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan. 
GENERAL LEAVE  
Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I ask unan-imous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to re-vise and extend their remarks and in-sert extraneous material in the R
ECORD  on the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Michigan? There was no objection. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-self such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, this bill, H.R. 1109, is, again, a bipartisan bill introduced by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. W
ALBERG ). It was reported by unani-mous consent from the Energy and Commerce Committee. It amends the Federal Power Act with respect to the prohibition regarding mergers or con-solidations by a public utility. Any merger or consolidation of a public utility whose value exceeds $10 million must first be authorized by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commis-sion. In addition, FERC is required to promulgate a rule within 180 days that mandates any public utility seeking to merge or consolidate to notify FERC within 30 days of transaction con-summation if the value of such merger or consolidation exceeds $1 million but, in fact, is less than $10 million. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. D
EGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.R. 1109, spon-sored by Representatives W
ALBERG and D
INGELL , which would add a $10 million threshold to trigger FERC review of a merger or consolidation. This is a sig-nificant change to current law as es-tablished through the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Obviously, FERC should not have to rely on trade publications or on word of mouth to know that merger or con-solidation activity involving regulated utilities is occurring. This bill, as re-ported by the Energy and Commerce Committee, includes language requir-ing FERC to undertake a rulemaking to develop a short, simple, notification process for transactions above the $1

million mark that fall below the new $10 million threshold. This addresses a problem, in that FERC lacked a standardized way to ac-quire the information necessary to know that these below-threshold trans-actions were occurring. Without that knowledge, it would be too easy for someone looking to evade the new $10 million threshold to break their trans-action into smaller pieces and, thereby, escape review. I want to commend the gentleman and the gentlewoman from Michigan for their work to address this matter. I think this is sensible legislation that reduces the burden on industry and on the government, while ensuring the public good is fully protected. I urge the passage of this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. W
ALBERG ), the author of the legisla-tion. Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague and friend from Michi-gan, the chairman of the Energy Sub-committee, as well as the ranking member of the subcommittee for this opportunity. I also want to start off by thanking the Energy and Commerce Committee staff on both sides of the aisle for their time and work on this issue. Additionally, I would like also to thank my colleague, D
EBBIE DINGELL , for being an original cosponsor of H.R. 1109 and helping advance this bipar-tisan and, might I add, commonsense rule. Based on current statute, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission takes the position that approval from the Commission is necessary for all merg-ers and acquisitions, no matter how small or insignificant the value of the facilities involved, even down to zero. FERC’s interpretation has led to trivial paperwork that bogs down the Commission and creates unnecessary red tape for American businesses, ulti-mately increasing utility bills for the consumer. H.R. 1109 will help reduce excessive paperwork burdens and bring down energy prices for American fami-lies. This bipartisan solution unties FERC’s hands and allows the Commis-sion to ensure American consumers are getting the most affordable and reli-able electricity possible in a common-sense sort of way. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1109. Ms. D
EGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation, and I yield back the bal-ance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. U
PTON ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1109. The question was taken; and (two- thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. f 
REINSTATING AND EXTENDING DEADLINE FOR CONSTRUCTION OF HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT 12715 Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 2122) to reinstate and extend the deadline for commencement of con-struction of a hydroelectric project in-volving Jennings Randolph Dam. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 2122 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-resentatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. REINSTATEMENT AND EXTENSION OF TIME FOR A FEDERAL ENERGY REG-ULATORY COMMISSION PROJECT IN-VOLVING JENNINGS RANDOLPH DAM. 
(a) E XTENSION OF TIME.—Notwithstanding the time period specified in section 13 of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 806) that would otherwise apply to the Federal Energy Regu-latory Commission project numbered 12715 (referred to in this section as the ‘‘project’’), the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (referred to in this section as the ‘‘Commis-sion’’) may, at the request of the licensee for the project, and after reasonable notice, in accordance with the good faith, due dili-gence, and public interest requirements of, and the procedures of the Commission under, that section, extend the time period during which the licensee is required to commence the construction of the project for not more than 3 consecutive 2-year periods that begin on the date of the expiration of the extension originally issued by the Commission. (b) O
BLIGATION OF LICENSEE .—Any obliga-tion of the licensee for the project for the payment of annual charges under section 10(e) of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 803(e)) shall commence on the expiration of the time period to commence construction of the project, as extended by the Commission under subsection (a).

Mr. Speaker, I yield my-self such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, this bill, H.R. 2122, was introduced by the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. MCKINLEY ), and it authorizes the Federal Energy Regu-latory Commission, FERC, upon re-quest, to extend by 6 years the time pe-riod during which construction must commence on the Jennings Randolph Hydroelectric Project, which is located on the North Branch of the Potomac River in Garrett County, Maryland, and Mineral County, West Virginia. Additionally, FERC may reinstate the construction license if it has expired. A similar bill passed under suspen-sion in the 114th Congress, so I hope that we can pass it again today. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. D
EGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2122, a bill to extend the deadline for commencement of construction of a hydroelectric project involving the Jennings Randolph Dam, sponsored by my Energy and Commerce Committee colleague, Mr. M
CKINLEY . In March 2012, FERC licensed the construction of a hydroelectric facility at the Army Corps’ Jennings Randolph Dam located on the Potomac River’s North Branch in Maryland and West Virginia. The licensee for the Jennings Randolph Dam project was not able to commence construction by the already- extended deadline of April 2016. The bill would authorize FERC to extend for 6 years the date by which the li-censee is required to commence con-struction. FERC has no objections to this legis-lation, and similar legislation passed the House by a 418–2 vote during the 114th Congress. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting H.R. 2122, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, so I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. D

ETERS ), and it was passed by unanimous consent by the Energy and Commerce Committee. The bill, H.R. 2274, amends the Fed-eral Power Act to allow the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, FERC, to extend periods relating to prelimi-nary permits and commencement of construction of hydroelectric projects. This bill is a commonsense bill, bi-partisan, and I would hope that all Members would join me in supporting it. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. D
EGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2274, the HYdropower Permit Exten-sion, or HYPE, Act. I am pleased that the House is con-sidering this legislation, which was re-cently introduced by my colleague, Mr. PETERS , of the committee, to provide the Federal Energy Regulatory Com-mission with the authority to grant longer periods for preliminary and con-struction permits and associated exten-sions under sections 5 and 13 of the Federal Power Act. Right now, as we have seen from the debating of these six bills today, this is something that can only be done by an act of Congress on a case-by-case basis. b1615 As much as we have all enjoyed de-bating these extensions of time today, it is clear that it would be more effi-cient and it also would save more time in Congress if these extensions could be done directly by FERC. I commend Mr. P
ETERS . I hope all of my colleagues will join me in supporting this bill. Mr. Speaker, I am now pleased to yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from California (Mr. P
ETERS ), the author of the bill. Mr. PETERS. Mr. Speaker, hydro-power is one of the few carbon-free en-ergy sources that provides a steady baseload of electricity. Producing more electricity from hydropower helps us meet our clean energy goals and reduce harmful emissions that pollute our air and water. This bill, the Hydropower Permit Ex-tension Act, would cut red tape for hy-dropower construction permits and incentivize greater investment in this energy source. The act gives already approved hy-dropower projects an extra year on their initial permit and allows FERC to grant a 4-year extension to projects that are delayed from breaking ground during their initial permit. And as the gentlewoman from Colo-rado (Ms. D
EGETTE ) said, right now this takes an act of Congress to extend construction permits for hydropower projects, even though they have gone through a rigorous environmental reg-ulatory process. Moving forward, the ultimate solu-tion to unlocking hydropower is to streamline the regulatory process. It is my hope that we can continue to have bipartisan, productive conversations like these on how to get hydropower projects moving, how to get them ap-proved more quickly, while still meet-ing high environmental standards. I want to thank Chairman W
ALDEN  and Ranking Member P
ALLONE , Chair-man U
PTON and Ranking Member R
USH, for working with me and the committee to advance this bill through the committee and to the floor. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I would urge my colleagues to vote for this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. D
EGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I would do the same, and I yield back the bal-ance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. UPTON ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2274. The question was taken; and (two- thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH4830 June 12, 2017 
This bill, H.R. 2292, was introduced by Mr. F
ASOfrom New York, and the bill authorizes the Federal Energy Reg-ulatory Commission, FERC, upon re-quest, to extend by 8 years the time pe-riod during which construction must commence on the Cannonsville hydro-electric project—which is located on the west branch of the Delaware River in the Catskill Mountains of upstate New York. The city of New York was granted a construction license for the Cannonsville hydroelectric project on May 13, 2014. Additionally, FERC may reinstate the construction license if it is expired. The bill was reported by unanimous consent from the Energy and Commerce Committee, and I sup-port its passage on the floor today. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. D
EGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2292, a bill to extend the deadline for commencement and construction of a hydroelectric project involving the Cannonsville Dam. On May 13, 2014, FERC licensed con-struction of a hydroelectric facility at the Cannonsville Reservoir located on the west branch of the Delaware River in Delaware County, New York. The li-censee for this project was not able to commence construction by the dead-line of May 2016. The additional reviews and repairs to the dam, which are necessary to begin construction of the hydroelectric project, will delay construction com-mencement beyond the expiration date of the original license and the 2-year extension which FERC is authorized to grant. The bill would, therefore, authorize FERC to extend up to 8 years the date by which the licensee is required to commence construction. Similar legislation passed the House during the 114th Congress by a vote of 417–2. I urge my colleagues to support the bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman from New York (Mr. F
ASO). Mr. FASO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express support for my legislation, H.R. 2292, which would extend the con-struction period for the hydroelectric project at New York City’s Cannonsville Dam in Delaware County, New York. Once completed, the Cannonsville hy-droelectric project will generate over 42,000 megawatt hours of electricity each year, enough to avoid the emis-sion of 24,000 tons of greenhouse gases. But, unfortunately, the project is in jeopardy due to this time lag. Current Federal Energy Regulation Commission regulations allow a li-censee 2 years to begin construction of a hydroelectric project once the license has been issued. The FERC may extend the deadline for an additional 2 years, but this may only be done once. If construction has not begun on the project by the expiration of the second extension, the Commission will termi-nate the license, risking all of the hard work and planning that had been put into the project development. I introduced this legislation to fur-ther extend the deadline for construc-tion at the Cannonsville site, because the second FERC-granted extension will expire shortly, and construction has not yet begun. By allowing for additional time for commencement of construction, we can help protect downstream communities and ensure the safe development of a clean and renewable energy project on this New York City-owned facility. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Mr. UPTON , the chairman of the sub-committee, and Ms. D
EGETTE , the ranking member of the subcommittee, and also thank the sponsors from New York State on this bipartisan legisla-tion, including Mr. E
SPAILLAT , Ms. M

OLLINS , and Mrs. M ALONEY . By bringing together the stake-holders from across the Empire State, we have ensured that a variety of con-stituent concerns have been met in the development of this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2292 so that we can fur-ther protect public water supplies for New York City and help strengthen and modernize our Nation’s energy infra-structure. Ms. D
EGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. U

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4831 June 12, 2017 
Mr. Speaker, this is the last bill in our cohort of six extension bills that we are considering today, which I hope Mr. P
ETERS ’ bill will absolve us from having to do in the future. This bill, the J. Bennett Johnston Waterway Hydropower Extension Act of 2017 was introduced by the gen-tleman from Louisiana (Mr. J
OHNSON ) on May 16, 2017. It would extend the time period during which the licensee is required to commence the construc-tion of the project for up to three con-secutive 2-year periods from the date of expiration of the original extension. Additionally, the legislation defers the obligation on the licensee to pay any annual charges required under sec-tion 10(e) of the Federal Power Act until the project actually commences construction. Finally, the legislation allows for the prospective reinstatement of the li-cense should that license expire prior to the legislation’s date of enactment. I just have to add a few words to what Mr. P
ETERS said earlier. Hydro-power is so important. It is such an im-portant renewable energy source in this country. We need to do everything we can on a bipartisan basis to make sure that we expedite these dams, that we really work together to get hydro-power, even more important in our en-ergy portfolio. Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues will favorably consider this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I echo the words from my good friend from Colo-rado. Hydro is an important renewable energy source, and it is one that sup-ports all of the above. It is an increas-ing force across the country so that is why these bills are so important, and it also shows why they are so bipartisan. Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-leagues to support the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. U
PTON ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2457, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-ceedings on this motion will be post-poned.

GENERAL LEAVE  
Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I ask unan-imous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-tend their remarks and to include any extraneous material in the R
ECORD on the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Michigan? There was no objection. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-self such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am also pleased that we are considering this legislation, H.R. 338, a bill to promote a 21st cen-tury energy and manufacturing work-force, introduced by my friend and great colleague, the gentleman from Il-linois (Mr. R
USH), and the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. H
UDSON ). This bipartisan bill takes steps to help make training for energy manu-facturing jobs available to women and minorities as well as veterans. By way of background, the bill was unanimously approved by the House last Congress by a voice vote. It was also included in the energy bill con-ference negotiations. But, unfortu-nately, even though the bill received overwhelming support in both the House and the Senate, it didn’t make it to the President’s desk before time ran out. The U.S. has undergone an energy renaissance, driven by newly discov-ered resources, technological innova-tion, and a skilled workforce. Millions and millions of new jobs had been cre-ated, and many more are opening up, but we have got to continue to invest in our workers in order to maintain global leadership and maximize the economic potential of our energy abun-dance. This bill, H.R. 338, takes important steps in the right direction by requir-ing that the Department of Energy modernize and improve coordination among the numerous workforce devel-opment programs and activities that expand the Department’s programs, of-fices, labs, and technology centers. This bipartisan bill places an empha-sis on maximizing the Department’s existing resources and increasing the diversity of our energy and manufac-turing workforce by increasing oppor-tunities for women, minorities, and veterans. It also improves reemployment op-portunities for out-of-work and dis-located workers, which, for example, would provide welcome relief to work-ers discouraged by sharp downturns in the coal industry. Mr. Speaker, this legislation before us today is a good government bill that is going to increase benefits for Amer-ican workers. I would encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting it. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. b1630 Ms. DEGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased we are considering this bill sponsored by my friend and col-league, the ranking member of the En-ergy Subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce Committee, Mr. R
USH. I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. R
USH). Mr. RUSH. Mr. Speaker, I must begin by commending Chairman W
ALDEN ; Chairman U
PTON ; Ranking Member P
ALLONE ; our friend and colleague from the great State of Colorado, Congress-woman D
EGETTE ; and the committee staff and all for working with my office to bring the 21st century workforce legislation to the House floor today. I must also publicly acknowledge the leadership of my colleague Mr. H
UDSON  of North Carolina and his staff, who played an instrumental and very im-portant role in helping us to get to this point. Mr. Speaker, the 21st century work-force bill represents hope and rep-resents opportunity for many of our fellow citizens who feel as though they have been locked out of the American Dream. Mr. Speaker, this workforce bill also provides an example of how Congress should function and work on behalf of the American people. This legislation enjoys the over-whelming support of Members of Con-gress who represent various constitu-encies from diverse regions of our Na-tion and who come with different and varying political persuasions. However, Mr. Speaker, we were able to put aside our political differences, our regional differences, and our cultural dif-ferences and focus our efforts on bring-ing forth a jobs bill that would benefit all communities and help lift up the American economy for all its people. Mr. Speaker, this bill directs the Sec-retary of Energy to prioritize the training of underrepresented groups, including minorities, women, and vet-erans, as well as displaced and unem-ployed energy and manufacturing workers. This bill directs the Secretary of Energy to take into full recognition the hurt and the pain of the White mid-dle class, of the White working class,

the African-American, the Black work-ing class, and the Brown working class in order to increase the number of skilled candidates trained to work in the related fields that were brought to bear by the energy renaissance in our Nation. This bill will strengthen and more fully engage Department of Energy programs and national laboratories in order to carry out the Department’s workforce development initiatives. This legislation will help to develop a skilled labor force trained to work in a wide array of sectors, including renew-ables, energy efficiency, oil and gas, coal, nuclear, utility, pipeline, and al-ternative fuels, as well as energy-inten-sive and advanced manufacturing in-dustries. Mr. Speaker, as we know, the energy and manufacturing industries are two of the most critical and fastest growing sectors both domestically as well as internationally. The potential of these two industries can help bolster the American economy and are also vital to the growing number of people seek-ing middle class status—not just a change of lifestyle, but seeking more money. They are satisfied with their lifestyle; they just need more income. It is important, Mr. Speaker, that we equip our citizens with the skills need-ed to meet this growing demand so that we can tap into these tremendous opportunities, and this bill, Mr. Speak-er, will help us accomplish that goal. Mr. Speaker, this 21st century work-force legislation addresses an issue that is neither partisan nor bipartisan, but, rather, it is nonpartisan. It is a nonpartisan issue that benefits com-munities, benefits industry, and bene-fits the overall American economy. This bill brings together government agencies, including the national labs, the energy and manufacturing indus-tries, unions, schools, community col-leges and universities, among others, and promotes cooperation and collabo-ration to ensure that we are tapping into a wealth of underutilized talent and are training and preparing workers for the energy and manufacturing jobs of the present and also of the future. Mr. Speaker, one of the challenges that many of my constituents—and constituents all across the land—have brought to my attention pertains to in-dividuals participating in training pro-grams that, in many cases, don’t even lead to finding a job. With that in mind, Mr. Speaker, this bill will help industry, schools, and community-based workforce organiza-tions to identify candidates for enroll-ment into training and apprenticeship programs. The objective will be to en-sure that the skills learned are imme-diately transferable to good-paying jobs and good-paying careers within the energy and manufacturing sectors regionally, nationally, and, indeed, internationally. Mr. Speaker, this bill is important because it matches up the needs of in-dustry with a willing and able work-force and, in the process, helps start new cycles of hope and opportunity for groups who have, in many cases, been overlooked and underserved: the White working class, the Black working class, and the Brown working class. This legislation can help to open new pathways to jobs, careers, and entre-preneurial opportunities for women, minorities, our veterans, and all the different working classes that comprise the American workforce while also helping to move our overall economy forward. Mr. Speaker, at a time when African- American and Latino unemployment rates are too high, when coal miners throughout the Rust Belt and beyond are finding themselves without work, when too many female heads of house-hold cannot find adequate employment to take care of their families, and when veterans returning from defending our country still cannot find a job, it is a travesty—Mr. Speaker, a travesty— that eager employers still cannot lo-cate the trained workers that they so desperately need. This is common sense, Mr. Speaker, and this is a commonsense jobs bill that will help match up trained and qualified candidates with good-paying jobs and careers that will help lift up communities, strengthen the energy and manufacturing industries, and bol-ster the entire American economy as a whole. With its focus not only on under-served communities such as minorities, women, and veterans, but also dis-placed and unemployed coal miners and other out-of-work energy workers, I can assure you, Mr. Speaker, that when this legislation ultimately be-comes law, it will go a long way in helping not only communities that look like the one I represent on the south side of Chicago, but look like communities all across the Nation, in-cluding communities in West Virginia, Kentucky, Indiana, and New Mexico— all across this country, every commu-nity and every district throughout this Nation. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. H
UDSON ). Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support H.R. 338, a bipartisan jobs bill to pro-mote a 21st century energy and manu-facturing workforce. By and large, we all share the same goals of creating more jobs and build-ing a healthy economy; but, as we have seen too often in Washington, progress can get caught up in partisan gridlock. I am focused on cutting through the partisanship and the noise and finding commonsense solutions to the prob-lems our country faces. H.R. 338 is a prime example of that. Much like the bipartisan Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act that I was honored to help get signed into law several years ago, H.R. 338 strengthens job training programs—specifically in the energy and manufacturing indus-tries—to invest in our workforce. This legislation will help connect individ-uals with job training programs while also making current programs more ef-ficient, and it takes important steps to increase opportunities for women, vet-erans, and minorities. As I have traveled across my district, I have seen firsthand just how effective local, high-skilled job training pro-grams can be: In Kannapolis, Rowan-Cabarrus Com-munity College has partnered with A.L. Brown High School on a welding program that will open doors for so many students; At both Stanly Community College and Sandhills Community College, the advanced manufacturing programs are the critical training grounds for high- skilled manufacturing workers; At Fayetteville Tech, veterans get the support and the skills they need to find meaningful employment outside of the Armed Forces. I want to thank Chairman UPTON , Chairman W
ALDEN , and Ranking Mem-ber P
ALLONE for their support. I want to thank Ranking Member B
OBBY RUSH for his leadership and for working with me in a bipartisan manner for a cause that is important to all of us, that is, to help people get back to work. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and to con-tinue to stay focused on America’s pri-orities: jobs and the economy. Ms. D
EGETTE. Mr. Speaker, my home State of Colorado has an econ-omy strongly based in the energy in-dustry. Of course, my district, which is primarily an urban district, has many, many workers who could be working in this industry, so I want to commend both of these gentlemen for sponsoring this legislation. It is a good bill. We need to get it across the finish line. Hopefully, be-cause we are doing it early in this Con-gress, we can get that done. Please vote ‘‘yes.’’ Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-self the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I just want to say I have watched these two gentlemen, Mr. R
USHand Mr. H UDSON , work together, something that our committee does a lot on lots of different issues, from oversight to energy, to healthcare, to telecommunications. Mr. R
USHhas had an outstanding ca-reer. The gentleman’s district is close to mine. He and I have been in each other’s districts quite a bit over the last number of years. This bill is a leg-acy to Mr. R
USH. The gentleman has cared with real passion about energy jobs and making sure that we have the expertise and the technical training knowing that we want to compete with the rest of the world. I commend the gentleman again for working with Mr. H
UDSON —a brilliant star on our side of the aisle—to get this bill done. We look forward to the President’s signing it into law, and we are looking

forward to having the Senate move similar bipartisan legislation so we can get the job done. That is what it is all about. So I want to thank the gentleman for his tireless commitment to getting this issue done. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill again. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 338, to Promote a 21st Century Energy and Manufacturing Workforce Future Act. For years, many of the industries I represent have complained of workforce shortages. In East Houston and Harris County, if we were able to recruit every union electrician in the country, we would still have a shortage. The same is probably true for pipefitters, welders, etc. The economy in our part of the country is rapidly expanding thanks to the development of the Eagleford shale and the Permian Basin. We must ensure that this economic pros-perity is shared across all of our community. In Texas, workforce diversity has to be a re-ality. I am pleased that Representative R
USH has crafted this legislation and I am proud to be an original co-sponsor. I am also proud to support workforce devel-opment opportunities for Hispanics, African- Americans, and women in the energy field. The industry needs skilled workers and we need to create opportunity for everyone, in-cluding many of those I represent in and around the area. The bill will encourage the Department of Energy to conduct outreach to these commu-nities to ensure they have access to the knowledge, skills and abilities required to fill high paying jobs in the energy field. Thanks to efforts by ExxonMobil and the Texas Gulf Coast Community College Consor-tium, we are already addressing the workforce needs of our industries but more needs to be done and this bill will help us achieve these goals. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. U

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH4836 June 12, 2017 
Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize June as LGBT Pride Month, a time in which we celebrate the progress our country has made to-ward equality and honor the contribu-tions of LGBT Americans to the di-verse fabric that is our Nation. I would like to thank the many orga-nizations in my congressional district, SAVE, Unity Coalition-Coalicion Unida, the National LGBTQ Task Force, just to name a few, and recog-nize their invaluable work to promote acceptance and fight harassment, bul-lying, and discrimination wherever it takes place. This month we also celebrate 2 years of marriage equality. The union of two people in marriage should not be based on gender, but on love, and those le-gally married couples deserve equal re-spect and treatment under the law. Mr. Speaker, this month of celebra-tion is also, sadly, a stark reminder that we have a lot more work to do to end LGBT violence. We also commemo-rate the 1-year anniversary of the Pulse Nightclub terrorist shooting. As we honor the memories of those we have lost, we must also make a com-mitment to stand together to disarm hate and demand the equality, dignity, and respect for all individuals at home and abroad.

LGBT PRIDE MONTH (Ms. FRANKEL of Florida asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. FRANKEL of Florida. Mr. Speak-er, after 18 years of a loving partner-ship, my friends, Tim and Mike, were finally allowed to do what billions of men and women have been doing for many centuries, enter a legal commit-ment called marriage. Yesterday, I had the joy of cele-brating LGBT Pride Month on the Na-tional Mall with Tim and Mike and hundreds of thousands of people of all genders and sexual orientations. We re-joiced our common humanity and the right for each person to be their true self. Miley Cyrus, the festival head-liner, said it best: It was a party in the USA. And, yes, our country has come a long way from the Stonewall riots of June 1969. The thing is, there is more work to be done. Today, we remember the horrific Or-lando Pulse Nightclub shooting 1 year ago. We must keep striving for a world where all people can live away from vi-olence and free to love who they want to love without recrimination. 
f 
LITTLE ROCK’S CHI ST. VINCENT INFIRMARY (Mr. HILL asked and was given per-mission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Little Rock’s CHI St. Vincent for being named to the 2017 list of 100 Great Hospitals in America by Becker’s Hospital Review. CHI St. Vincent Infirmary’s history of excellence in patient care dates back to 1888, when it began as a 10-bed char-ity hospital and the first hospital in Little Rock. Over the years, to meet increasing demand for patient care, in addition to expansion for construction, the hos-pital has made four moves to larger fa-cilities. In 1906, the hospital opened Ar-kansas’ first nursing school, the St. Vincent’s Infirmary School of Nursing. I am proud to have come into this world at St. Vincent, as did our two children. I would like to thank CHI St. Vin-cent for continuing its 129-year legacy of leadership in patient care centered on service and quality care in central Arkansas. f 
AHCA TO REPEAL AFFORDABLE CARE ACT (Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speak-er, last month, House Republicans passed the AHCA, which would repeal the Affordable Care Act, and now Re-publican Senators are working on their own version. So far, we know the plan they are de-veloping will be a disaster for our econ-omy and for countless Americans who will either pay more for their healthcare or struggle to afford cov-erage at all. The Senate plan would force working families to pay higher premiums, end Medicaid as we know it, and could make health insurance near-ly unaffordable for people with pre-existing conditions and older Ameri-cans. At this point, we don’t know more details of the Senate plan because the Republican leadership is attempting to deny the American people a voice in their own healthcare system. We need a healthcare reform that lowers cost, expands coverage, and strengthens our economy. We need leg-islation written in the light of day that can survive public debate. We do not need this.

HONORING PENN STATE’S OLDEST ALUMNUS (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to ad-dress the House for 1 minute and to re-vise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, last week, Penn State community lost a legend. Mr. Ray Walker passed away Friday at his home. He was 105 and Penn State’s old-est living alumnus. Ray told our local newspaper that he saw the university grow a lot over the years from ‘‘just a cow college’’ to be-coming one of the largest universities in the Nation. Penn State truly shaped Ray Walk-er’s life. Back in 1931, he thought he wanted to be a doctor, but there was a requirement that he needed to take German. After failing twice, he re-evaluated his major and decided to pur-sue business. Around that time, his father told him that he would have to leave Penn State because the family money was lost in the bank crash. But Ray went to work: He started selling potatoes and coal to fraternity houses, and by the time he graduated in 1935, he was sending money home to help his family. He founded Bradford Coal and was the driving force in surface mining all over the world. Penn State and I will miss Ray Walk-er. He was a friend. He was a distin-guished alumnus and loved by all who knew him. May he rest in peace. f 
PRESIDENT TRUMP’S MUSLIM BAN (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, the tired, the poor, the huddled masses yearning to breathe free are still welcome in America, no thanks to President Trump. Today, for the second time, President Trump lost a ruling on his Muslim ban in the Federal courts of ap-peal. The purpose of the President’s ban is clear. The then Presidential candidate Trump explicitly called for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims enter-ing the United States. Just last week, President Trump criticized his revised ban as politically correct and called for a much tougher version. The President’s executive order is a Muslim ban, plain and simple. Any ar-gument to the contrary is undercut by the President’s own tweets. President Trump, by his own words and by his own actions, is abdicating America’s moral leadership. The great-ness of America is not built on isola-tion and discrimination. It is built on the rule of law and the ideals of equal-ity and inclusion and on the rich his-tory of immigration.

SUPPORT THE STAPLE ACT (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, bril-liant minds from around the world come to the United States to pursue advanced degrees. Unfortunately, for many of these individuals, after we train them, after we educate them, we force them to return to their home countries due to our outdated immigra-tion policy. And then guess what? They compete with us. They compete with the American economy, and this makes no sense. That is why I am authoring the bi-partisan Stopping Trained in America

The STAPLE Act exempts individ-uals born outside the United States from the limits of employment-based green cards and H–1B visas that are awarded annually if that individual has earned a Ph.D. from an American insti-tution in the STEM fields of science, technology, engineering, or math. Mr. Speaker, by retaining the talent that has benefited from our education system, we can unleash even more eco-nomic and innovative opportunity here at home. Not only does the STAPLE Act help promote the American Dream for those from overseas, but it also brings the potential for new invention and ideas that benefit American fami-lies and jobs here at home.

REMEMBERING 49 AMERICANS GUNNED DOWN AT THE PULSE (Mr. CICILLINE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, on June 12, 2016, 49 Americans were gunned down at the Pulse Nightclub in Orlando. Tonight we remember the beautiful lives lost and all those who suffered injury in this horrific attack. Sadly, LGBT Americans continue to be the target of horrific hatred and vio-lence here and around the world. Don’t let anyone tell you that we have full equality in this country. We don’t. There is too much hatred in this coun-try. Anytime an LGBT American is mocked or treated as less than equal, it is an attack on the values that all of us share as Americans. These expressions of bigotry and intolerance only serve to exacerbate hatred and violence. We cannot let them go unanswered. Over the last few days, so many have joined in showing their support for the LGBT community and remembering the victims in Orlando. We are strong-est when we stand united toward a common purpose of equality for all Americans. It is my sincere hope that we will build greater understanding toward one another and move closer toward ensur-ing that every American can live free from discrimination and violence of any kind and in a world where every-one is valued and treated with dignity and respect.

EXPRESSION OF GRATITUDE TO HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES EN-TERING THE MILITARY (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her re-marks.) Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and to express my gratitude to the young men and women who are answering the call to serve in our military upon graduation from high school this year. Throughout New York’s 22nd Con-gressional District, countless men and women are serving our country. We are thankful to those who will now join them in the armed services. They have taken upon themselves a duty and a re-sponsibility far greater than them-selves. General MacArthur famously said: ‘‘Duty, honor, country: those three hal-lowed words reverently dictate what you ought to be, what you can be, and what you will be.’’ We as a community and as a country are thankful for their dedication and service. We wish them tremendous suc-cess in their service to our great Na-tion. I also wish to acknowledge specifi-cally the Conklin Kiwanis Club’s ‘‘First to Say Thank You’’ program that was held to honor the men and women of the Southern Tier who are joining the military service. From the 22nd District, there are 35 individuals who are being recognized, and their names will be permanently commemo-rated in the official CONGRESSIONAL  R
ECORD . I congratulate them and thank them.

b1915 RECOGNIZING BEATRICE AND FRED SORKIN (Mr. SCHNEIDER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I am so pleased to rise today to honor two remarkable constituents and their ex-traordinary achievement that should stand as a model for us all. Last month, Beatrice and Fred Sorkin of Lincolnshire, Illinois, cele-brated their 77th wedding anniver-sary—77 years of love, family, and com-mitment. Bea and Fred met as teenagers in Brooklyn, New York. Fred was a sheet metal worker by trade and in 1950 started his own business that he ran for over 40 years. Bea worked in a bank. She began selling savings bonds and rose to become a bank teller and even-tually assistant vice president. Their family has been blessed with two children, Rae and Herbert; their spouses, Michael and Gloria; four grandchildren: Jeffrey, Andrew, Alyse, and Sharon; and, now, seven great- grandchildren. According to the data collected by the Worldwide Marriage Encounter Or-ganization, Bea and Fred are the long-est married couple in all of Illinois. Bea and Fred Sorkin’s enduring life-long connection is an inspiring exam-ple for us all. On behalf of Illinois’ 10th District, it is my privilege to congratulate Bea and Fred on their 77th wedding anniver-sary. I wish them and their family many more years of health and happi-ness together. REPUBLICANS NEED TO PRODUCE A BUDGET SO WE CAN SERVE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE (Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, this House needs to get the job done for the American people and make sure that we operate by regular order. That means we want to pass bills here so that we can operate the Government of the United States, whether it is the De-partment of Defense, the Small Busi-ness Administration, or across the range of departments and agencies. But you can’t do that well unless you have a budget. Now, the Republicans control this House, the Republicans control the Senate, and the Republicans control the White House. They should be able to agree among themselves to pass a budget; and then when, as an appropri-ator, we pass our 12 appropriation bills, we are given a number and we mark up those 12 bills and we don’t go over budget. But guess what. The Republicans can’t produce a budget. Later this week, we are told the Mili-tary-Veterans Affairs appropriation bill will be marked up in committee and money will be put in that bill. The problem with that is, if we put the money in that bill, how do we know that we will be able to have money left over for the other 11 bills to fund sen-iors’ Meals on Wheels or the infrastruc-ture bill that people are talking about? We have a real problem. The Repub-licans need to do the job and produce a budget so that we can serve the Amer-ican people as they expect us to do.

TEXAS WOMEN VETERANS DAY (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise with great jubilation and excite-ment to recognize and congratulate the Catholic Charities as they celebrate this day, June 12, being an historic day in Texas because it has been named as Texas Women Veterans Day. The Catholic Charities of the Arch-diocese of Galveston-Houston wants to ensure that the Texas legislators who supported this are, in fact, congratu-lated. And we are grateful that it was signed into law. Texas has the highest number of women veterans of any State in the country—last year, 183,597—and these heroes and sheroes could soon have a special day when the State will annu-ally recognize their sacrifices. June 12 now has historic significance. On June 12, 1948, the Women’s Armed Services Integration Act was passed nationally, allowing women to serve as regular members of the military. ‘‘We are delighted that this special population that has bravely served our Nation will be honored in this impor-tant way,’’ says Cynthia N.

But to the staff of Catholic Charities, those who travel to Austin and all of those who recognize that we must honor these veterans as the heroes and sheroes of the Nation, congratulations. You have a day, June 12. Now, forever, we will honor you on this day. God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.

LASKETT ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, it is with great honor that I rise today to coanchor this CBC Special Order hour. I would like to acknowledge the great work and the leadership of our chair, C
EDRIC RICHMOND of Louisiana, and, of course, my coanchor, M
ARC V
EASEY of Texas, as we lead the discus-sion for the next 60 minutes. In these next 60 minutes, we have a chance to speak directly to the Amer-ican people on issues of great impor-tance to the Congressional Black Cau-cus, Congress, and the constituents that we represent. In this hour, we would like to discuss racism and discrimination in America and, specifically, hate crimes and the radicalization and the domestic ter-rorism that they present to the Amer-ican people. The conclusion of Dylann Roof’s trial a few month’s ago is the latest re-minder that homegrown terrorism has become part of the fabric of life in America. This problem shows no signs of fading yet reveals a threat that is both rare and more complex than sim-ple explanation suggests. Solving the issue of domestic ter-rorism through hate crimes involves understanding the true nature of the problem—violent domestic extre-mism—so that effective steps can be taken to protect the Nation from it. It is legitimate to ask whether home-grown terrorists are being radicalized. We talk about jihadi narratives and Is-lamic extremism, the Islamic State group recruiting online; but there are other groups in this Nation which are radicalizing our youth, radicalizing young people to be a threat against other Americans. This is a subject and a discussion that has rarely been dis-cussed and which we believe is very im-portant. Since 2001, almost 40 percent of the nearly 150 terrorism fatalities in the United States were related to domestic motivations, not jihadi narratives. It is my hope that in the discussion we will have this hour we are able to discuss in depth the effect that these hate crimes and this domestic violence has on the United States. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  a letter that was written June 7, 2017, by the Congressional Black Caucus to the Honorable Jeff Sessions, Attorney General; Andrew McCabe, Acting Di-rector of the FBI; and John Kelly, Sec-retary of Homeland Security, in which we express our concern over the alarm-ing number of hate crimes reported across the country, particularly in the wake of the election of President Don-ald J. Trump.

CTING DIRECTOR MCCABE: I write today to express my concern over the alarming num-ber of hate crimes reported across the coun-try, particularly in the wake of the election of President Donald J. Trump. In addition to speaking out against this rising tide of hate, violence, and intolerance, it is critical that your agencies proactively investigate each and every incident of a potential hate crime and aggressively prosecute these cases to the fullest extent of the law. During the presidential campaign, then- candidate Donald Trump employed starkly divisive rhetoric to connect with a segment of his base that relished in cultural griev-ance and hatred. His tone and the arguments that he made were incredibly offensive to minority communities, and his campaign rallies were forums for some of the ugliest public displays of race-based violence and animus in modern political times. Numerous Black Americans were assaulted at his ral-lies and scenes of deep racial resentment against Blacks, Hispanics, immigrants, and Muslims were frequently paraded and cele-brated. Since the election, it seems hate-filled in-dividuals have been emboldened to terrorize minority communities. In just the first 34 days after the election, the Southern Pov-erty Law Center counted a total of 1,094 bias incidents around the nation. Disturbingly, the Center also calculated that 37 percent of these cases directly referenced either Presi-dent-elect Trump, his campaign slogans, or his infamous remarks about sexual assault. This data is just from the immediate after-math of the election. The numbers have in-creased since then, with national news pro-viding coverage. These are not isolated inci-dents, but rather a frightening trend forming before our eyes. In fact, this is occurring in Congress’ own back yard, like the horrific hate crime that took place just a few miles away at the Uni-versity of Maryland when Richard Collins III, a promising young man, was stabbed to death on the eve of his graduation from Bowie State University by an admitted white supremacist. There have also been sev-eral reports of nooses hung throughout the District of Columbia, including in the Afri-can American Museum of History and Cul-ture and on American University’s campus. To add insult to injury, a Mississippi law-maker recently called for Louisiana politi-cians to be ‘‘lynched’’ for supporting the re-moval of racist confederate monuments from New Orleans. Surely there is no greater cause of a gov-ernment than to protect the lives of its citi-zens, particularly those uniquely vulnerable to hate, intolerance, and violence. The fed-eral hate crimes statutes were designed with that mission in mind and serve as a criti-cally important tool in combatting the most insidious elements of our society. That is why I implore you to dedicate additional re-sources within your respective agencies to address the increasing frequency of these de-plorable acts. you should and must inves-tigate each and every potential hate crime and prosecute offenders to the fullest extent allowed under the law. You should also en-sure that community leaders, including state and local law enforcement, understand the federal resources available to investigate and prosecute hate crimes. Your leadership is required to not only bring justice to the victims of hate crimes, but also to send a clear message that these acts of domestic terrorism will never be tol-erated in this country. Sincerely, CEDRIC RICHMOND , Chair, Congressional Black Caucus. 
Ms. PLASKETT. In addition to speaking out against the rising tide of hate, violence, and intolerance in this country, it is critical that those agen-cies—the FBI, the Department of Jus-tice, as well as Homeland Security— speak out and proactively investigate each and every incident of potential hate crime and aggressively prosecute these cases to the fullest extent of the law. Since the election, it seems that hate-filled individuals have been emboldened to terrorize minority com-munities. In just the first 34 days after the election, the Southern Poverty Law Center counted a total of 1,094 bias incidents around the Nation. Disturb-ingly, the center also calculated that 37 percent of these cases directly ref-erenced either President-elect Trump at the time, his campaign slogans, or infamous remarks about sexual as-sault. This data is just from the imme-diate aftermath of the election. The numbers have increased since then. It is the responsibility of this Con-gress as well as those agencies to stem this flow of violence that is occurring in this Nation. We know that our President would not tolerate these sorts of matters, and we are hopeful that he, the Justice Department, the FBI, and Homeland Security will do whatever is necessary to protect Amer-ican lives from hate crimes that are oc-curring, domestic terrorism, and the radicalization of our young people to exert hate against other Americans. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. V
EASEY ), my co-anchor, to speak on this issue. Then we will have an opportunity to hear from other members of the Congressional Black Caucus about this. Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ms. P
LASKETT for starting off this Spe-cial Order hour on racism and discrimi-nation in the age of Trump.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4839 June 12, 2017 
I really think that this is important and timely that we talk about this be-cause, as you mentioned, these inci-dents are on the rise and we need to start to discuss them. We need to have open and honest, frank discussions about them, to be quite forward, be-cause, if we don’t, then we are never going to be able to move past this or be able to have a better America in re-gards to racism, hate, and discrimina-tion if we don’t begin to have that open dialogue. Not only does the country need to have an open dialogue, but I think that, as Members of Congress, we need to be the leaders in this area, and we should be the ones who are kicking off the dialogue and starting this. Make no mistake about it, I know a lot of people will tell you that racism is dead, that discrimination is a thing of the past, that it was something that happened to people that are baby boomers and older and that the effects of discrimination are no longer with us, but we know that is not true. We know that, again, as Ms. P
LASKETT just mentioned a second ago, since 2016, there has been a disturbing number of incidents that have oc-curred, a disturbing number of things that have been said, things that have been tweeted, the rise of the alt-right, and so many other things that we should be concerned about. The Southern Poverty Law Center supports this very claim. This organi-zation has collected over 1,300 reported bias incidents between the day after the election and February 7. Let me point out, because I know that, sadly, there are some people that will cast doubt towards the Southern Poverty Law Center, but the Southern Poverty Law Center has done a tre-mendous job over the last couple of decades or so of not only helping iden-tify people that commit acts, but groups like the KKK, neo-Nazi groups, and others. Quite frankly, I don’t know why any-one would want to try to undermine or put down an organization that wants to put down groups like that, like the KKK, skinheads, and Nazis. It makes no sense. I hate when I hear people say bad things about the Southern Poverty Law Center because of the time, money, and effort that they put into fighting groups like I just mentioned. Let me be clear, because oftentimes when we talk about race, it turns into a very divisive topic, and we don’t need for this to be a divisive topic. We need to sit down, come together, and talk because we need to create an oppor-tunity here in America where we can change people’s attitudes and make sure that our Nation’s history is not repeated. b1930 I also think that, as parents, we have to openly talk about race, bigotry, and hate with our children. One of the things that disturbs me as a parent and, quite frankly, just as a proud American is I will hear people say: Well, I don’t say racist things in my house, so my kids would never hear that. If kids are saying racist things, then it must be because they are hear-ing it at home. But I have to tell you, as a parent of an 11-year-old, I know that there are influences outside of my home. I know that there is a lot of peer pressure on kids. I know there are a lot of things on social media, and kids want to fit in. Kids want to be cool. So you can never utter one bad thing about a dif-ferent nationality or race or someone of a different sexual orientation than yours in your house, and your kid could still end up being caught up in something bad like bigotry or racism just because of inappropriate influ-ences at school. That is why it is important, in my opinion, that, as parents, we talk about this with our children, as uncomfort-able as it may make us, but we need to have the discussion. We need to know and our children need to know that it is important to us that we recognize other people’s culture; that we recog-nize other people’s faith and sexual ori-entation and religion so that, as they are forming and they are growing, they understand that this is a nation that is a great nation that is open to every-body, regardless of race, ethnic, or gen-der background. I know that for some people, having to talk about racism, it can be very un-comfortable because it makes people guilty. A lot of times when it comes up or you are talking about this, you just—you hear people trying to come up with different examples to sort of assuage any sort of guilt that they may have. It makes them very uncomfort-able. But, again, we have to tackle this head-on. We have to come together to confront these issues of social injustice because it really is time that our Na-tion heals. It is time that our Nation heals and it is time that we break the chains of our plagued history. I know that we have other Members here on the House floor that want to talk, and I have some things that I am going to mention a little bit later, just some of the unfortunate incidents that have happened with the President, with the Commander in Chief, the history that he has with racism that I would, quite frankly, like to see him address. Whether it is HUD discrimination, Cen-tral Park joggers, after they were ex-onerated by DNA, I think that his com-ments were: ‘‘Well, they still did some-thing bad,’’ so on and so on. Just some of the issues at the casino that he owned in New Jersey, we need to talk about those. Quite frankly, he can be a leader—he can actually be a leader in discussing these incidents that happened under his control and under his command, whether it was at his private corpora-tion or whether it was commenting on the Central Park joggers, about how it was a learning experience for him, how he is never going to let it happen again, and how he is never going to let those words utter out of his mouth. But before I go into that, I am going to turn it back over to the Representa-tive PLASKETT from the Virgin Islands. I, again, thank her very much for kick-ing this off. Ms. PLASKETT. Congressman V
EASEY , I think it is important, one of the things you talked about is what is going on in our homes and the fact that our children can be radicalized outside of the home. This is an oppor-tunity for us as Americans to see the victimization even of those children who become a part of the alt-right, who become a part of neo-Nazi groups; that they are, in fact, being radicalized by these very disturbing groups, and that we, as leaders in America, have a re-sponsibility. That is why I am asking unanimous consent to have the letter that was written by Chairman C
EDRIC RICHMOND  put into the R
ECORD —the letter of June 7 that went to the FBI, to Homeland Security, as well as to the Justice De-partment to ask them to investigate and take proactive stances; not just to protect those individuals who are vic-timized when violence occurs, but to protect those young people and others who may be untowardly influenced by social media to become part of these groups. I think that is a great point that you bring up, as well as our President be-coming someone who can lead the charge against this. We see the rise of this activity during his campaign and after his election. Well, then our Presi-dent needs to be the one to be Presi-dential and to stem this influence and this rise of hate crimes that are taking place. Mr. Speaker, at this time I am ask-ing that our colleague, D
ONALD PAYNE , from the great State of New Jersey, who has done an amazing amount of work in his own community in the area of Newark in trying to stem violence and criminal justice, the reform work that he is doing, to speak on this mat-ter this evening. I thank him so much for the time that he is giving us. I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. P
AYNE ). Mr. PAYNE. Well, first, I thank the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands, Congresswoman P
LASKETT , and the gentleman from Texas, M
ARCVEASEY , for hosting tonight’s Special Order hour on such an important topic: rac-ism and discrimination. Before I begin, I want to take a mo-ment to mark the 1-year anniversary of the Pulse Nightclub shooting and to re-member the 49 lives that were cut short in the deadliest mass shooting in our Nation’s history. As we grieve for the victims and their families, we must continue to stand in solidarity with the survivors and with the LGBTQ community against hate, intolerance, for love, in support of our Nation’s values of equal-ity and dignity for all.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH4840 June 12, 2017 
The kind of intolerance, hate, and vi-olence on display that day in Orlando has become an alarming trend in this country, a trend that has disturbingly been fueled by President Trump. Ac-cording to the Southern Poverty Law Center, 37 percent of the 1,094 bias-re-lated incidents in just the first month after the election referenced the Presi-dent, his campaign slogans, or his re-marks about sexual assault. As he did throughout his campaign, President Trump continues to speak the language of racial and cultural grievance, pitting Americans against one another and perpetuating the vi-ciousness he pretends to despise. The result is what you would expect: a spike in hate crimes and hate speech. I have seen in my district in New Jer-sey where anti-Semitic graffiti was plastered on a pedestrian bridge. We have seen it at American University and just down the road at the National Museum of African American History and Culture, where nooses were found last month. Communities of color know this pain all too well. Mr. Speaker, I am really fortunate to be able to discuss an issue of such im-portance to this Nation. This is one na-tion, under God, indivisible, with lib-erty and justice for all. You know, I have been very fortunate in my life to have been born into a sit-uation where a great American prior to me held this seat for 23 years in the 10th Congressional District of the State of New Jersey. His name was Donald Payne. He was my father and he afforded me a lifestyle, one of which I did not know of his suffering and pain growing up as a young African Amer-ican in this country. But even in that situation, I have found myself—irre-spective of being in that position, I found myself in situations that have been dangerous and uncomfortable. As a young, 20-year-old—you know, when we are 20, we do things that we probably shouldn’t be doing at times. I was on my lunchtime going downtown to pay a bill at a department store where I had my first credit card, and I was running late. So what I decided to do was make a U-turn on the main street, Broad Street, in Newark, New Jersey, which is the largest street in the town. And I made a U-turn to come in front of the store. Naturally, you know, with my luck, a motorcycle police officer was coming down the street at the same time. So he pulled me over, as he should, and I was wrong. But I was using my cousin’s car. So when he asked me for my li-cense and registration, I could not find the papers that I needed and I was fum-bling and nervous. The officer leaned into the car and used the N-word and said: If you don’t find those documents in a minute, I will throw you so far under the jail that they will never find you. So this is very frightening for any citizen to go through. So I was able to get my license, and I handed it to him. Just before that, they would throw me so far under the jail that they would never find me again. Once I handed him my license and it said that I was D
ON-
ALDPAYNE , Jr., whose father was a sit-ting councilman in the city of Newark, his whole attitude changed. ‘‘Don’t you know that you could get hurt, or you could hurt someone, or you have to be careful.’’ A minute ago I was nothing. I would be so far under the jail, they would never find me. But now that I am connected to something or someone, all of a sudden we have be-come paternal. Mr. Speaker, there are millions of people in this country that aren’t con-nected to someone, and these are the types of things that they go through. So I am just here to say that we must be vigilant. I believe in this country; I believe in its greatness. I believe in the words in the Pledge of Allegiance. I be-lieve in the Constitution. We must make it work for all Americans. Ms. PLASKETT. Thank you so much, Mr. P
AYNE , for your words, your en-lightenment, and for sharing that very personal piece of you and your own ex-perience. There are so many African Americans and so many people of color in this country who have those exact same experiences. Whether it is us, personally—I know I have mine exactly like that. You know, I have four sons, and each one of them have had that kind of experience here in this country. With the rise of hate that is occur-ring, we have to be careful for every American and we need to be concerned that this country is no longer becom-ing a safe place for groups of individ-uals; that there are people that are ris-ing up and attempting to terrorize other Americans. This should be of concern to Congress. This should be of concern to our President. I thank Mr. P
AYNE again for that. Mr. Speaker, at this time I yield to Congresswoman S
HEILA JACKSON LEE from Texas, who sits not only on the Budget Committee, but, very relevant to our discussion this evening, is one of the senior members of the Judiciary Committee, as well as Homeland Secu-rity Subcommittee, where so many of these issues form a confluence. Thank you so much for being with us this evening, Congresswoman J
ACKSON  L
EE. We look forward to your remarks and to the enlightenment that you will be giving us here in this Chamber as well as the American people. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-woman from Texas (Ms. J
ACKSON LEE). Ms. JACKSON LEE. Well, first of all, it is my honor and privilege to thank Congresswoman P
LASKETT for her on-going leadership in speaking to our col-leagues and the American people. Let me take a moment of personal privi-lege to say to her that, over the week-end in Texas, I was with a number of individuals from the Virgin Islands, and it certainly was my first task to tell them of the excellent representa-tion that they were getting by her leadership on so many issues. But to you, I want to say that we were at the commissioning of the USS Gabrielle Giffords, and proudly so. The commander of that ship is from the Virgin Islands, so there was a contin-gent of individuals from all over the country for recognizing the commander and his wife. Let me say that I made sure that those sailors knew who was supporting them as well. It certainly was a great honor to former Congress-woman Giffords, and there wasn’t a dry eye as we did that. So I just wanted to add that and thank you for your indul-gence of that. If I might, let me also acknowledge my colleague on the floor, Congress-woman VALDEMINGS , and Floridians who are here, just to make note of the commemoration of the tragedy at the Pulse Nightclub. b1945 This is the area in which the Con-gresswoman policed, if you will, and her spouse still there leads the commu-nity in law enforcement. I will honor to those who lost their lives, but to the recognition that terrorism and hateful acts are not to be accepted by any of us. As a good friend of mine, a Muslim, said yesterday as we stood against hateful acts against Muslims around the world, and particularly around the United States, he said that the way that we deal with this danger is to love in recognition of the human dignity of all. To the LGBTQ community, my deep-est sympathy and recognition in this month that we honor and have Pride Month that we recognize your deep in-volvement in this country and your right to human dignity. So I thank Congresswoman P
LASKETT for allowing me to engage in that statement. Let me say that I would hope that none of us would have wanted to be on the floor tonight to talk about the changing face of America since the election of the President of the United States but, in fact, to recognize that there has been a surge in discrimina-tion throughout this Nation. The roots of racial extremist vio-lence against peaceful Black commu-nities runs deep in American history: from this country’s dark path of chat-tel slavery; to the southern lynch mobs that sought to permanently disenfran-chise the Black vote; to the church bombing that killed four little Black girls in Birmingham; to the disman-tling of an entire economic district in Tulsa; and to the senseless stabbing, just a few weeks ago, of a bright, young man by the name of Richard Collins III. I am sad that the election of Presi-dent Trump—and I am not sure wheth-er this has been brought to his atten-tion. I would like to bring it to his at-tention—has created a divisive atmos-phere. Trump’s political debut was cen-tered on the racist birther movement, which questioned the citizenship of then-President Obama.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4841 June 12, 2017 
He was not in office then. And to some, it was a little humorous; some were shocked. Certainly, the Black community did not take it humor-ously. This was a Senator who had been duly elected by the citizens of Illinois. He had done nothing to bring in com-mentary on himself personally. He sought the Presidency of the United States. He offered to the American peo-ple all of the documentation that would be required, yet Donald Trump persisted for 5 years in insisting, through fake news, that he was not a citizen of the United States of Amer-ica. During his political campaign, he re-peatedly refused to reject the endorse-ment of White supremacist groups. He failed to condemn supporters who shouted out racist slurs, and, on occa-sion, violently attacked protestors who happened to be an African-American woman, in particular. In a nation completely comprised of immigrants, he has built a hateful movement around building a wall. And to my friends who are Hispanic, par-ticularly Mexicans, he called them drug dealers and any number of names. This country has prided itself on the value of immigration, of diversity, and, certainly, freed slaves who have come to make this country the great country that it is. Overall, his anti-immigrant incidents were the most reported, 315 incidents; followed by anti-Black, 221; anti-Muslim, 112; and anti-LGBT, 109. So I just want to take a moment to add to my commentary, the things that I think are grossly horrific; that we should realize that this is not a time for the CBC to be on the floor casting blame. Let me also, as I acknowledge Con-gresswoman P
LASKETT , thank our chairperson, Congressman C
EDRIC RICH-
MOND , for his really unceasing leader-ship of the Congressional Black Caucus and the work that he has done to make sure that we astutely have the infor-mation to be the conscience of Con-gress. These are the pictures of hatred. This is the individual who killed the young man that—I don’t want to show the wrong picture—but this is a picture of an individual who was engaged in the killing of two individuals, I believe in Portland, Oregon, because they were trying to defend someone of a different background. We have a noose found hanging near a school in Washington, D.C. This is a picture of that. This has all happened since the election of President Trump. We have an incident, June 9, 2017, The Washington Post says, ‘‘‘Shut up, Slave!’: A spilled Starbucks drink led to a racist tirade and sidewalk fight. . . .’’ I don’t know if people are under ex-treme tension, but this is all happening in 2017. We have another one: A day without racism? Not for Trump’s administra-tion. The Department of Justice is dis-mantling, or lowering the Civil Rights Division, cutting the staffing that is there. Hate crimes in the U.S. rising. These are the kinds of things. And tragically, here is a handsome, beautiful, young man who was taking his commission and getting ready to graduate, Richard Collins III, and he was killed. Let me finish on these points about the criminal justice system that I think is very important. Black Americans are more likely to have their cars searched. Black Americans are more likely to be arrested for drug use. Black Americans are more likely to be jailed while awaiting trial. Black Americans are more likely to be offered a plea deal that includes prison time. Black Americans are more likely to serve longer sentences than White Americans for the same offense. Black Americans are more likely to be disenfranchised. We also know that we have statistics, that I will offer into the RECORD , of Black American youth who are more likely to be included in the juvenile de-tention center, police stops, police searches, use of force during arrest, ju-venile arrests, transgender arrests. Sixty percent of the transgender ar-rests are Black or Latino; arrests for marijuana. Most Blacks are not likely to get pre-trial release. More Blacks are likely to be prosecuted. More Blacks are likely to get prison versus community serv-ice. Length of incarceration is longer than Whites. State judge incarceration, there are 208,000 people in State prison for drug offenses; 32 percent are White, 68 per-cent are Black. Federal drug convictions are higher among African Americans. Forty-seven percent were Hispanics, and we are higher than those. Federal court sentencing, and, of course, incarceration of women African Americans are higher. Sentencing to life without parole, African Americans are higher, 65 percent. Hiring people with criminal records, that makes it very difficult for us to work, and eliminating the right to vote. So, Congresswoman, I will close by simply saying, where is the President on standing with the moral compass of asking the hatred to stop; to really em-power a Department of Justice not to be led by an individual who has fought against voting rights, fought against the rights of those who are seeking to be rehabilitated in the criminal justice system; to join a bipartisan army of in-dividuals against mass incarceration? Where is the President in standing against the hatred that has impacted the African-American community? The words that he has said, where is the President in stopping this on-slaught that is generating into vio-lence in the streets? Where is the moral compass of this administration? If it is not you, Mr. President, the Congressional Black Caucus will not take a back seat to you. We will fight and bring this coun-try back to where it should be, and that is a country that believes in the equality of all Americans, and the Afri-can Americans who have died and bled in wars, and have been slaves, and, in essence, came through a reformation to be free. We will not take a back seat to all of this hatred. I ask you, Mr. President, where are your answers? Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues, Congressman VEASEY and Congresswoman P
LASKETT for anchoring this important special order on ‘‘Racism and Discrimination in Amer-ica.’’ For over 40 years the CBC has been at the forefront in the fight against the evils of rac-ism, discrimination, marginalization, and the various manifestations of institutionalized ra-cial bias. In today’s uncertain times, we must be more steadfast than ever to continue that fight. No matter what your party identification is, I believe we can all agree that we must root out extremist violence everywhere, and especially within our borders. And while we are all committed to elimi-nating ISIS and all its sympathizers, we must not underestimate the threat of domestic ter-rorism and domestic violence by racial extrem-ists. Throughout the history of this country, Afri-can-American communities have faced innu-merable threats from those who don’t com-prehend that there is value within our nation’s diversity. The roots of racial extremist violence against peaceful Black communities runs deep in American history: From this country’s dark past of chattel slavery, to the southern lynch mobs that sought to permanently disenfran-chise the Black vote, to the church bombing that killed four little girls in Birmingham, to the dismantling of an entire economic district in Tulsa, to the senseless stabbing of a bright young man by the name of Richard Collins III just a few weeks go. As a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, or the ‘‘Conscience of the Congress’’, I call on this body to do all it can to stem the rising tide of racial violence. Although progress has been made, Presi-dent Trump’s divisive rhetoric, and the actions of his followers, have shown us that we still have much work to do before all of America can feel safe. Consistent rhetoric of intolerance coming from Trump’s campaign and now his adminis-tration has not only put a target on African- American communities, but also on Mexican- Americans, Muslim-Americans, women, and those within the immigrant population. The election of Donald Trump has had a significant effect on the nation’s race relations: Trump’s political debut was centered on the racist ‘‘birther movement’’, which questioned the citizenship of then President Obama for months. During his political campaign, he repeatedly refused to reject the endorsement of white su-premacist groups. He failed to condemn supporters who shout-ed out racist slurs and on more than one oc-casion, violently attacked protesters. In a nation completely comprised of immi-grants, he has built a hateful movement around building a wall to keep them out.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH4842 June 12, 2017 
This country has prided itself on being the melting pot of the world. The bastion of free-dom of equality. Violence against any person based on their class, color, or creed is not only immoral, it’s anti-American. We must condemn, denounce, and seek to eliminate these acts of racial terror with the same fervor that we would when dealing with religious extremists. I have to quote former Attorney General Eric Holder who stated, ‘‘Though this nation has proudly thought of itself as an ethnic melting pot, in things racial we have always been and continue to be, in too many ways, essentially a nation of cowards.’’ Regardless of who resides at 1600 Pennsyl-vania Ave., this body, the people’s chamber, has a responsibility to do all that it can to en-sure the safety of all Americans. That is why I, along with my colleagues from the Congres-sional Black Caucus, have sent out a letter to the Attorney General, the Secretary of Home-land Security, and the acting director of the FBI urging them to allocate more time and re-sources to curbing the recent uptick in vio-lence. Incidents of Racialized Violence Since the Election: The Southern Poverty Law Center has con-ducted a report on incidents of racialized vio-lence following the Presidential election. There were over 1000 violent attacks re-ported within a month of the election. Overall, anti-immigrant incidents were the most reported at 315 incidents, followed by anti-black (221 incidents), anti-Muslim (112 in-cidents), and anti-LGBT (109 incidents). Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the Congresswoman for her lead-ership on issues related to the Judici-ary Committee and to others. At this time, I would like to invite the Congressman, not just from New York, but from, of course, what I be-lieve is the best, most illustrious bor-ough in New York City—Brooklyn, of course, which is where I was born and raised. Thank you so much, Congressman J
EFFRIES , for your leadership on the Judiciary Committee, your discussions about the issues that we are discussing here this evening, and I am waiting to hear what you are going to not only present to us here in this Chamber but to the American people on this issue. I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. J
EFFRIES ). Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands for yielding, and for the phenomenal job that you have done, along with my classmate, the dis-tinguished gentleman from Texas, Rep-resentative M
ARCVEASEY . As you know, I have great affection for the fact that you have a significant connection to Brooklyn. We say back home, there are two types of Ameri-cans: those who live in Brooklyn, and those who want to live in Brooklyn. But, certainly, this is a significant issue, that the Congressional Black Caucus has gathered here today to dis-cuss during this hour of power, the op-portunity for members of the Congres-sional Black Caucus to speak directly to the American people on an issue of great significance. Since January 20, we have seen a dis-turbing increase here in America in anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim, anti- Black, anti-LGBT, and anti-Semitic acts. And the question is: Is this just a co-incidence, or could it possibly have something to do with the election of the 45th President of the United States of America? Now, in part, what we are seeing is connected to a historic backlash that has often occurred throughout this journey that we have been on here in America, that whenever we make sig-nificant progress, there is always a backlash amongst some in America who have got a problem with the fact that we have done things designed to be more consistent with our values of liberty and justice for all, equal protec-tion under the law. We know slavery was the original sin here in America. That was corrected in the aftermath of the North’s victory during the Civil War. We had the recon-struction amendments: the 13th Amendment, abolish slavery; 14th Amendment, equal protection under the law; 15th Amendment, the right to vote regardless of race. That was progress in America followed by the in-evitable backlash. The imposition of Jim Crow laws; a lynching epidemic; Black code, seg-regation, particularly through just the Deep South. Progress followed by back-lash. And then finally, in the 1960s, in an effort to create a more perfect union and address the unfinished business in America, you had the civil rights movement, anchored with the ‘64 Civil Rights Act, effectively ended Jim Crow; the ‘65 Voting Rights Act, giving African Americans in the Deep South, people of color throughout the country the right to vote, unimpeded from things like grandfather clauses, and poll taxes, and other types of shenani-gans that people were practicing; the 1968 Fair Housing Act capped off the civil rights movement, followed by the inevitable backlash. Richard Nixon ran a racist campaign, a southern strategy, designed to appeal to aggrieved Whites in parts of this country, particularly in the Deep South, ushered in an era of resistance to the progress that had been made, antibusing, antiaffirmative action. And then, of course, we have got Barack Obama who was elected in what many of us viewed as an incredible step in the right direction. African Ameri-cans, having gone from the outhouse to the White House. Eight years of tre-mendous progress in moving this coun-try forward, followed by the election of Donald Trump, a man who spent 5 years perpetrating the racist lie that Barack Obama was not born in the United States of America. And many of us are wondering, why were so many people who worship at the altar of White supremacy drawn to Donald Trump’s campaign? What was it about this individual that so many folks dripping in hatred flocked to his candidacy? That is not to say that ev-eryone who voted for Donald Trump is a racist. We do know that every racist in America voted for Donald Trump. That is a problem. And so, again, I just ask the question in closing: Is this all a big coincidence? We know part of it is the backlash that has often occurred whenever we have made progress in America. But this President has a responsibility to ad-dress the rise in hate crimes that have taken place on his watch, whether or not his election is directly connected to it. Many of us have our own suspicions, but he is the Commander in Chief. b2000 He has got to tell his Attorney Gen-eral, who is straight out of central casting in terms of the good old boys: Your job as chief law enforcement offi-cer in the land is to enforce the laws whether you like them or not. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-bers are reminded to refrain from en-gaging in personalities toward the President. The gentlewoman from the Virgin Is-lands may continue. Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. JEFFRIES ). Mr. JEFFRIES. In closing, Mr. Speaker, I will simply say that every single thing that has been said—and I would urge you to challenge anything as a fact. In fact, there are facts that have been left out in terms of my re-marks about the 45th President of the United States. I have actually been kind of gentle as it relates to the per-son who is occupying 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue right now, but more to come. I would welcome the Speaker to dispute anything that has been said in the name of us trying to move this country forward consistent with the notions of equal protection under the law and lib-erty and justice for all. Ms. PLASKETT. I thank Congress-man J
EFFRIES and I really appreciate his remarks. I know that this House has rules and is concerned about deco-rum in here. We at the Congressional Black Caucus are also very concerned about decorum. While we uphold the position of the President of the United States, many individuals—particularly constituents, the underserved within our communities—are fearful about us actually speaking out, specifically to the personage and to the person of President Donald Trump. What we are trying to do in this Spe-cial Order is speak unrefutable facts; not about the personality, not subjec-tive discussion about the President, not our feelings, and not our fears, but the actual facts of what has happened in this country and what is happening in this country because that is life for our children, that is the very essence of us continuing, and that is what democ-racy is about. If we cannot critique the actions of our President, then that is very fearful

to us as Americans and very fearful to this House, which is supposed to be a separate branch of government and which I recall maybe a year ago it speaking very vehemently against the person who was in the White House at that time. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-woman from New Jersey (Mrs. W
ATSON  C
OLEMAN ), who is my classmate. I thank Congresswoman W
ATSON COLE-
MANfor her work, particularly in work-ing with other Congressional Black Caucus women to found the Caucus for Black Women and Girls, which is very important right now because this is a forgotten group quite often here in the United States, and the gentlewoman is advocating and speaking out for those individuals. Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the Congresswoman so much for her leadership and this Special Order hour and considering this subject matter that we are going to discuss. I want to talk a little bit about something that has sort of been my ob-servation and my experiences for a very long period of time and I think that are actually exacerbated by this Presidency that we currently have in this House. Let me, by way of associa-tion, just comment positively to the remarks of my colleague and the former speaker, H
AKEEM JEFFRIES from New York. I entitled my remarks ‘‘From the Cradle to the Grave.’’ From the cradle to the grave, Black people in America are required to be resilient, courteous, and persistent. The rules are always different. From the cradle to the grave, Black people in America must be comfortable and confident in ourselves, but only so much so that we do not intimidate or aggravate. From the cradle to the grave, Black people in America are told our plight, our struggle, and our sacrifice is a mere fantasy in post-racial America while we witness the reality of institu-tional racism, conscious discrimina-tion, and our rich history erased or ap-propriated. From cradle to grave, Black people in America experience this racism and discrimination walking home from the corner store eating a pack of Skittles, listening to music at a gas station, or simply sitting in our neighborhood park. We experience this racism and dis-crimination showing up to school in our natural hairstyles, shopping in our favorite stores, or even just showing up to work—including the Senate and the House of Representatives. Last Wednesday, it was reported that Black troops are far more likely than their White counterparts to face court- martial or other forms of military pun-ishment. National data shows us that Black girls are 5.5 times more likely to be suspended from school than White girls. That rate actually balloons in my State of New Jersey to 8.5 percent. More than 60 years after Brown v. Board of Education, school systems in the United States are still separate and unequal. As of 2014, California had 31 open de-segregation cases. In 2016, a Presi-dential candidate ran a campaign on divisive rhetoric that targeted our communities, our well-being, and our safe spaces. It only gets worse. From the cradle to the grave, we are told to calm down, sit down, and be courteous and humble. From the cradle to the grave, the experiences, the chal-lenges, the stories, our history, and even our very being are kept out of boardrooms, classrooms, voting booths, department stores, history books, movie screens, television scripts, and the like. But let me just tell you that, from the cradle to the grave, we are built to persevere, we are strengthened to over-come, we are born to lead, we are com-mitted to uplift, and we are fully equipped to soar with weights on our shoulders even in these times and even under this Presidency. And guess what. We do. Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman very much for her inspiring words and motivation to us all. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. E VANS ). We al-ways bring up the fact that Congress-man D
WIGHT EVANS is a freshman, but he isn’t really a freshman. Everybody acknowledges his leadership in his work in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and the State house that transcends him as a freshman. We call the gen-tleman a superfreshman in that respect because he comes with a great deal of experience and wisdom here to the House floor. I am very anxious to hear what the gentleman has to speak about related to hate crimes and the rise of domestic terrorism against people of color and against minorities here in this country. Mr. EVANS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from the Virgin Is-lands for her leadership, along with my colleague from Texas, because both of them have demonstrated real clear leadership for the Congressional Black Caucus and the leadership of our chair-man, C
EDRIC RICHMOND . So I thank both of them publicly for what they have done and all of the members of the Congressional Black Caucus. Mr. Speaker, we have a lot to lose under the Trump administration. It has been very clear, as has been stated by all of my colleagues, from healthcare to food policy, to education, to affordable housing, the President and his party continue to look for ways to take away what we have come to know as fundamental programs behind building stronger neighborhoods. Our Nation is facing challenging times and we simply cannot afford to carry on business as usual. From the nooses found at the Smithsonian Na-tional Museum of African American History and Culture to the racial slur spray-painted on LeBron James’ house during the NBA finals and attacks against Jewish community centers and vandalism in Jewish cemeteries, our country and our globe are sadly seeing horrific increases in discrimination and racially biased incidents. Dr. King always said: We have come over here in different boats, but we are now in the same boat. I really mean just that. Think about it: an attack against one of us is an at-tack against all of us. We know we have come a long way in our fight against racial intolerance and hate in our country, but our journey con-tinues. It doesn’t matter if you are Black, Jewish, Hispanic, or LGBT. We are stronger together when we cele-brate both our similarities and our dif-ferences. When we watch the news, it is incred-ibly upsetting to see what is still hap-pening in 2017. A little over a week ago at the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Cul-ture here in D.C., we found another noose on the Smithsonian grounds. The museum’s founding director said: ‘‘It is a painful reminder of the challenges that African Americans continue to face.’’ We know that we are not only seeing violence and intolerance against the African-American community, but it is everywhere. This year at the Mount Carmel Cemetery, a Jewish cemetery just outside of my district in northeast Philadelphia, countless tombstones were toppled and vandalized. Days after this, the JCC in Wynnewood in my district received a bomb threat. These are just a few of the truly cow-ardly acts of violence taking place in our neighborhoods, yet our Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, and the Presi-dent claim to be tough on crime. They want to put more people in cities be-hind bars. This weekend, Mr. Speaker, I was the keynote speaker at Gaudenzia, an ad-diction treatment and recovery center in my district. The graduates are some of the strongest individuals in our city, and their stories of perseverance and hard work are truly inspiring. I always say: Where you start is not where you end up. Throughout my career, I have been dedicated to trying to find ways to build stronger neighborhoods block by block. To do this, we have to make good jobs, great schools, and access to healthcare a reality. We know the tradition and reentry back into our neighborhoods isn’t al-ways easy. In Philadelphia, ShopRite supermarket is hiring to give good-pay-ing jobs to those who formerly were in-carcerated. The company estimates they have given over 500 jobs to for-merly incarcerated individuals. This is the result in one city. Sadly, we know that racism and big-otry are still a factor in our commu-nities. We have to confront this head- on. As the Congressional Black Caucus

collectively stands here today, we will not accept what is taking place. We are prepared to face these challenges, and we are asking others to join us because we recognize that we can move this country forward, but it will take all of us. So what we are doing here today is raising the awareness because we must have this conversation in a public way. We must deal with this issue of racism, noninclusion, and discrimination. No longer can we accept this. Mr. Speaker, I say to you today: As a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, we are prepared to do our part. Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman very much for his remarks and continued work to discuss middle communities, middle neighbor-hoods, and the importance of these communities and how they need to be protected. Congressman V
EASEY , we have had a discussion here this evening about so much of the rise in hate crimes and the rise of racial tensions. I know that this weekend Puerto Rico had its plebiscite in which they talked about becoming a State. One of the things that I often talk to people about is the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, Northern Mariana Islands, and Puerto Rico, all of us are territories now after 100 years. It was never the intent of Congress for areas of the United States to be a territory for 100 years except for the fact that these are now people of color. These are communities of people of color. So based on the insular cases 100 years ago which said that the people living in the territories and offshore territories were people of alien races who couldn’t understand Anglo-Saxon principles of law, that is why we were not able to have the full-fledged rights of American citizens. b2015 Now we are seeing, even here on the mainland, individuals, people of color, who are being treated as second-class citizens and who are not afforded the full protection of this country. When you have incidents like on May 20 with Richard Collins, on May 26 with Jeremy Joseph Christian, who began shouting racial slurs at two women on a Portland, Oregon, train, and as the two men stepped in to de-escalate the situation, those two great men were stabbed to death, and a third man was wounded, much needs to be done. We have our moments of silence when there are mass shootings. We mourn for the families of Pulse night-club and for what happened in those areas. But it is not enough for us to have Special Order hours, to have dis-cussions, or even have moments of si-lence. Action must be taken by this ad-ministration. Mr. VEASEY. Absolutely. We do need action taken by this administration, Representative P
LASKETT . I mentioned to you earlier that I wanted to talk about the President’s history on racism and some of the things that came out in the cam-paign—not anything new but, never-theless, very disturbing—and why we need for the President honestly to lead this discussion. GENERAL LEAVE  
Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on the subject of this Special Order hour. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. S
MUCKER ). Is there objection to the re-quest of the gentlewoman from the Vir-gin Islands? There was no objection. Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I know that there were other issues that the gentleman wanted to discuss with re-gard to some of these and examples that he wanted to give as well, and I yield to the gentleman from Texas. Mr. VEASEY. Very briefly, we have the President’s history on racism from the very beginning of his candidacy, of course, and the way he disparaged Mexicans and Mexican Americans in this country by calling people rapists and accusing people of bringing disease and crime into the United States, pre-tending that he didn’t know who David Duke was. It is unbelievable, pre-tending to not know who David Duke was. Ms. PLASKETT. I think he knows now. Mr. VEASEY. Even condoning the beating of a Black Lives Matter pro-tester, his history extends before that. Of course, it was very well covered, very well chronicled during the cam-paign about the Justice Department suing his real estate company and his father’s real estate company for not renting apartments to Black people, not renting apartments to African- American potential tenants. Of course, they ultimately settled that lawsuit because of the wrongdoing that hap-pened there. Ms. PLASKETT. That was in the 1970s, I believe. Mr. VEASEY. The gentlewoman is absolutely correct. In 1989, he encouraged and celebrated the wrongful imprisonment of the Cen-tral Park Five and took out full-page ads in New York area newspapers call-ing for the return of the death penalty in response to a very infamous case in which a woman was beaten and raped while jogging in Manhattan’s Central Park. Back then, before he was President, Donald Trump said: They should be forced to suffer, and when they kill, they should be executed for their crimes. I want these murderers and al-ways will. Of course, there was a lot of public outrage over that case. It was very well talked about. It was on all the talk shows and what have you. Those men wrongfully spent time in prison because the DNA evidence exon-erated them. Ms. PLASKETT. Actually, they weren’t men at the time. They were teenagers. Mr. VEASEY. They were teenagers at the time. Even after the DNA evidence exoner-ated them, he still said that maybe they could be guilty of something. I thought that was a terrible thing to say. Of course, the New Jersey Casino Control Commission fined Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino $200,000 in 1992 be-cause managers would remove African- American car dealers at the request of certain big-time gamblers that would come in. In 1996, 20 African Americans in Indi-ana sued Trump for failing to honor a promise to hire mostly minority work-ers for a riverboat casino on Lake Michigan. Let me tell you why, even despite this, the President has the ability to lead a discussion on race. You might remember Shirley Sherrod. I don’t know if that name rings a bell with you. She was an Afri-can-American agricultural worker who worked for the U.S. Department of Ag-riculture, the Georgia Department of Agriculture, and was given an example of how she overcame her own bias and her own racism. Of course, her comments were mis-construed and the tapes were made to sound one way. She ultimately lost her job. She was offered her job back after it was proven this conservative news-paper had actually tried to disparage her so they could have some sort of a racism equivalent or something to try to make the readers feel better. The reason why I bring that up is be-cause here was a woman that was being honest about and trying to give an ex-ample about how she overcame bias and how she overcame prejudice. The President has an opportunity to talk about Central Park, to talk about rac-ism in his apartments, to talk about the issues at the casino, to talk about the other areas in his life where he has fallen quite short when it comes to fairness and honesty and racism. So we need him to lead that discussion so we can begin to talk more and begin to heal our country. Ms. PLASKETT. Part of leadership is expressing your shortcomings and using that as an opportunity to move forward and to move the Nation for-ward. So many people look to our President for his leadership and for his thoughts and his out-of-the-box think-ing. This would be tremendous not only to the people who are being oppressed, but to others as well. One of the things I wanted to leave us with was a quote and some work that the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law is working on, that has a mission to secure equal justice for all through the rule of law, tar-geting, in particular, the inequities confronting African Americans and other racial and ethnic minorities. In December 2016, Kristen Clarke, who is the president, stated: ‘‘Hate

crimes and hate-filled incidents stand as a dark cloud over our democracy. The recent spike in hate crimes is at-tributable, in part, to racially charged rhetoric that characterized the 2016 election cycle and the rise of ‘alt-right’ white nationalist extremism. This is a moment that calls for Federal, State, and local officials to use every tool in their arsenal to fully investigate and prosecute these incidents when they occur.’’ And we from the Congressional Black Caucus say, as well, to eradicate this from our Nation. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the 2016 presidential election was an exceptionally bitter fight between Re-publicans and Democrats. The election high-lighted many of the existing divides between many Americans and the underlying frustra-tions that we have been wrestling with as a people. Couple this with the resentful partisan-ship that we have experienced in Congress, and it is quite clear that there are deep rifts di-viding our country. However, one of the big-gest consequences of this partisan bickering and inability to compromise has been the in-crease in the frequency of hate crimes across America. The latest figures from the Southern Poverty Law Center estimate that there have been nearly 1,372 bias incidents between the day after the election and February 7, when these statistics were last reported. SPLC is col-lecting self-reported data from across the country in an effort to monitor ‘‘bias inci-dents’’—or acts of hostility that are motivated by racism or other prejudices—across the United States. While it is important to acknowl-edge the limitations of self-reported data, this trend is consistent with several other incidents reported nationwide that have challenged the notion that we are living in a post-racial soci-ety. For example, several nooses were found throughout our nation’s capital this month— one near an elementary school, another in the African American Museum of History and Cul-ture, and on American University’s campus. On June 2, a Muslim couple was allegedly harassed in Oregon and told to go back to their country. More prominently, two men in Portland were stabbed to death and another wounded when they tried to intervene on be-half of two women, one of whom was wearing a hijab, who were being verbally assaulted by a man yelling slurs. Mr. Speaker, these are just a few of the hor-rendous incidents being reported in the wake of this election and the hateful rhetoric that has come to define the political narrative. However, I am here to join my colleagues not only to denounce these actions and hateful words, but also to remind ourselves that we are better than this. We are better than this as a people and a nation, and we must all do our part to discourage this behavior and hold these violators accountable. Until we all take active roles within our society and democracy, we cannot reasonably expect our society to overcome these challenges and emerge a stronger society. I am proud to join my col-leagues tonight in sending a clear message that these acts of hatred and violence will not be tolerated. Not today, not ever. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-bers are reminded to refrain from en-gaging in personalities toward the President.

GENERAL LEAVE  
Mrs. DEMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentle-woman from Florida? There was no objection. Mrs. DEMINGS. Mr. Speaker, as I stand here tonight before you, in my hometown of Orlando, thousands of people are gathered at Lake Eola Park like they were 1 year ago to mourn, honor, and pay tribute to the 49 lives we lost on January 12, 2016. We were with them earlier today. We would love to be with them tonight, as we were last year, but we are here doing the job we were elected to do. I am joined tonight by my col-league—I am absolutely honored to serve with him—Representative D
ARREN SOTO. We stand here tonight on the floor of the House of Represent-atives together so the world will not forget the lives we lost in the Pulse nightclub shooting. It was supposed to be like any other Saturday night for the men and women inside the Pulse nightclub. I can only imagine the excitement they shared that evening as they celebrated birth-days and friendships. Mr. Speaker, they were out for what my bishop likes to call late-night fellowship. Then, at 2:20 a.m., when everyone was closing their tabs for the night and about to head home, it was then that an ISIS-inspired gunman, motivated by hate, walked into the club and opened fire. Within a matter of minutes, he was able to kill 49 people and wound so many others. The innocent men and women in the club didn’t stand a chance against him that night. We lost 49 lives. Their full potential will never be known, and we will al-ways wonder, when we think about their lives, what could have been. Many others continue to recover from their visible and invisible wounds. In the days and weeks following the Nation’s deadliest mass shooting, we saw our community come together in beautiful ways. We mourned with those who lost their loved ones. We came out in droves to donate blood for the sur-vivors who needed it. We showed sup-port and gratitude for our law enforce-ment officers, our first responders, and the nurses and doctors who acted with courage and bravery in the face of un-imaginable tragedy. We embraced and celebrated the di-versity that makes Orlando ‘‘The City Beautiful.’’ We showed the world that we are a city who defeats hate with love. One year after the shooting, the wounds are still fresh and the scars are still not fully healed, but our commu-nity is resilient and united in the face of this tragedy. Mr. Speaker, I yield to my colleague from Florida, (Mr. SOTO). Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Florida, Representative V
ALDEMINGS . First of all, I thank her for her service in law enforcement and also for her husband, Jerry Demings’ service in law enforcement and to re-member the 1-year mark of the Pulse nightclub shooting. b2030 I wrote a poem entitled: ‘‘Our Pulse Still Beats.’’ 
Inspiration from a brother lost too soon A place for his memory to play the tune Alas his pulse ceased A safe place for a rainbow of people Full expression was presented throughout this steeple They all danced to the pulsating sounds Then came a night of celebration For many friends from many nations On the move to impulsive grooves In the midst of the night a dark figure en-tered Hate-filled heart and soul a splintered His guns pulsating death. Horrors, and cries, as bullets fly Some they ran and some they died Their pulses ceased to be Brave officers infiltrated the scene A melee ensued amidst the smoke and gleam And in the end terror was silenced, the repul-sive vanquished Medics and firefighters quickly came to the rescue Seeking out those who cried out with fading hues Come quick he is still breathing, wait she has a pulse In makeshift ambulances staining ER floors in red One by one saved from the dead On the monitor, pulses finally steady beep, beep, beep In the morn Orlando awakes in sadness But comes together as One above the mad-ness The pulse of the city is unspeakable grief and unbreakable love From everywhere we came to the Center, the Bloodbank, the Lake, and the Streets We gave our time, our pennies, our blood, our hugs, and our eats Donors with a strong pulse are needed to re-plenish our stock Makeshift monuments grew before our eyes We gathered at Dr. Phillips for those we lost and those still alive As the bell rang 49 times, sorrow became the natural impulse, but so was unity This emotion, this grief, this love was felt around the world By mothers and fathers, boys and girls A community pulsating with sadness and de-fiant hope Our happy little tourist town known for magic Became the site of history’s most violent shooting, tragic But our community’s pulse still beats One year later one community stronger Our pulse still beats For those who survived

Our pulse still beats And for those we lost Our love still remains For the 49 angels our love still remains Though pain will ever be in our hearts Our love still remains. 
Mrs. DEMINGS. I want to thank my colleague from Florida (Mr. S
OTO) for that very beautiful and inspiring poem that really captures not only the trag-edy that occurred in Orlando at the Pulse Nightclub that night, but the he-roic acts, how our community came to-gether, and really provides the hope that our community needs in moving forward. Mr. Speaker, no one can tell the story better than the family members who lost their loved ones that night, the survivors who were within the club that night. At this time, we would like to share some of the letters from fam-ily members and survivors. The first letter that I would like to share comes from a mother who, if you were watching at all during the early hours of this tragic incident, this par-ticular mother was going around ask-ing anyone who she could about her son, trying to find him, trying to get word of him. I would like to share a mother’s story from Christine Leinonen. ‘‘My son was one of the 49 people killed at Pulse Nightclub on June 12 of 2016. Those were 49 humans who collec-tively could have lived another 2,500 years. That is longer than we have had civilization. They were moms, dads, siblings, kids, straight, gay, Latino, Asian, Caucasian. They were your con-stituents. They deserved better than to die in a flurry of bullets. ‘‘My son Chris was a happy, quirky, goofy young man and had been from baby on. He was every mother’s dream to hit the kid lottery. He was an only child, and I never married. I couldn’t have loved him more. ‘‘He became a licensed mental health therapist. He loved his work and his personal life. ‘‘Chris had many friends. Chris and his boyfriend, Juan, were one of at least three couples to die together that night: another Juan and two Luises. Chris was one of two Christophers to die that night and at least six Chris-tophers who died or survived. The mag-nitude of the killing is that there were so many names repeated. ‘‘My son was a loving and giving per-son. He was someone who was going to be my right-hand man as I became old and incapacitated. Now I have no one. ‘‘Chris lived his life with love and kindness. He was a walking, talking United Nations, inclusive of all; not by design, but because he cared about character, not race, gender, sexuality, or ethnicity. He lived a life of inclu-sion. You would have loved him if you knew him, whether he was your child or friend or cousin or coworker. The world has a little less joy without him in it. ‘‘Hugs and kisses, Christopher’s mom.’’ And at this time, I would like to yield to my colleague from Florida (Mr. SOTO), who will continue to share. Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, I thank Con-gresswoman D
EMINGS for sharing Chris’ story. A coworker of mine, Ramses Tinoco, who survived the Pulse Nightclub shooting, sent me this letter entitled ‘‘Everlasting Unity.’’ ‘‘My name is Ramses Tinoco, and I am a Pulse Nightclub shooting sur-vivor. I thank God for giving me the opportunity to continue with my life so that I can spread empowerment, compassion, love, and unity. ‘‘I want to express my feelings and point of view. Realistically, as a com-munity and nation, we all suffered a tragic attack of terror on this one-year remembrance of June 12, 2016. Today, this is known as the biggest mass shooting in American history. Here at the doorsteps of Pulse Nightclub, let’s take in consistent consideration of the ones who ultimately suffered the most: the victims, families of the deceased, the injured survivors, the other sur-vivors who were there and escaped by God’s grace, and the community who stood by, grieved in the aftermath. ‘‘As a community, we have been given an opportunity to rebuild our-selves as stronger individuals and help those that are falling behind in depres-sion, anguish, lament, and grief. As a community, we must show that con-stantly we are not alone, we are united more than ever, and, above all, that we are better than yesterday. ‘‘This attack was a terrible and un-fortunate tragedy to live through. It was an ultimate reminder that there is still a lot of discrimination and hate in this world. However, we must engage, learn from it, and utilize it to confront and prevent future fear in our commu-nity and ultimately the rest of the world. We can’t be stronger if we fuel hate and negativity. We can’t be stronger by pointing fingers and cen-soring others based on their race, fi-nancial status, sexual orientation, and religious beliefs. ‘‘Our world is facing some hard times. Everyone is becoming a victim. How can we stop this and end the fear? We must stand up and speak out for our rights, for our peace and protec-tion, and for the safety of our country. Above all, we need to engage solidarity and equality for the love of humanity. We can begin to make this world a bet-ter place, right here, right now. It starts with you going out and doing something nice for someone. We need to live in a world free of fear. That time begins now. ‘‘Ramses Tinoco’’ of Orlando, Flor-ida. Mrs. DEMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative S
OTOfor his remarks. I would like to continue to share let-ters from the survivors of Pulse. The next letter that I will share comes from Brandon Wolf. ‘‘It is hard to believe it has been a year. That Saturday night was like any other: loud music, skinny jeans, cheap drinks. Alongside my best friends, Drew Leinonen and Juan Guerrero, I was as free as ever. Standing outside on the patio, in his typical way, Drew tossed his arm around my shoulders and spoke his last words to me: ‘You know what we never say enough? That we love each other.’’’ Those were the last words that Drew spoke that evening. ‘‘ . . . I learned a lesson from Orlando’s recovery: that equality and unity aren’t trophies, and the journey we are on isn’t over. We can’t take our eyes off the prize or forget what lies ahead. ‘‘We have to disarm hate. Silence it. Snuff it out. Replace it with the same message Drew had for me: love. ‘‘Brandon Wolf.’’ At this time, I yield to my colleague from Florida (Mr. SOTO) to share an-other letter regarding this tragic inci-dent. Mr. SOTO. I thank the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. D
EMINGS ) for shar-ing Brandon’s story. Next we have a story from a friend. ‘‘My name is Jim McDermott, and I am a good friend of Chris Brodman who was the first survivor of the Pulse mas-sacre to pass away of a rare brain aneu-rysm on September 11 of last year. Chris came to Orlando and made it his home in the fall of 2007. His outgoing, natural interest in other people and their stories made him quite popular in our community—and we are still griev-ing his loss to this day. It is hard to imagine that his constant, wonderful smile is not around anymore to bright-en our days. ‘‘He was and is the best friend one could ever have. ‘‘Chris was celebrating at Pulse a few days late because he had to work on the actual day of his birthday itself. He was lingering with friends, enjoying the festive atmosphere of the club that was one of his favorites, when the at-tack began. In what I find to be an ex-ample of his character, Chris pushed his friends to safety over the back fence first before escaping himself. Not one person who knows him finds this to be a surprise, as Chris was always our protector, our confidante, and our hero. ‘‘As we come upon the one-year mark of the assault on Pulse, we wanted to remind the world of his heroism and his day-to-day loving example of how a great person can affect your life for the better. Chris loved people that were ut-terly themselves and unique. He prized authenticity and loyalty wherever he went. He had high standards, and he lived by them, and it made us want to live up to them as well. ‘‘I know in my heart that he would want us to bridge the divides that sepa-rate us. He believed strongly in forgive-ness and kindness. He was open to new ideas and new ways of thinking if it would lead people to a better life. My favorite recent picture of him was after the shooting where he proudly held up

a sign at the LGBT Center downtown saying: ‘Love always wins.’ ‘‘In his memory, let us strive to re-member not just the victims of this tragedy but the survivors as well. Let us ensure that they are getting the counseling and medical care that they continue to need. We should strive to maintain the loving bubble of hope that has surrounded our city, because of this event, despite all of the strife and division elsewhere in this country. We need to tell, preserve, and remem-ber their stories, for they are worth hearing.’’ b2045 ‘‘They have important lessons to teach all of us. Orlando is known as being the premier destination in the world for families of all kinds—a rain-bow of diversity that is infused in every aspect of our city beautiful. So today let us protect the loving vision Orlando has become around the world in the face of this tragedy. Let us stay Orlando Strong. And in so doing, we re-main the beautiful haven that drew Chris to us. ‘‘And let us never forget the red- haired boy from Shirley, New York, who taught us about unconditional love and friendship from the day he ar-rived. ‘‘We love you forever, Chris. ‘‘Sincerely, ‘‘Jim McDermott.’’ Mrs. DEMINGS. Mr. Speaker, at this time, I would like to share a survivor’s letter by the name of Joshua McGill. ‘‘My name is Joshua McGill, and I was there the night of the Pulse shoot-ing a year ago. ‘‘Although nothing will ever take away that tragic night for me and the fellow LGBTQ community, not only for Orlando, but for all people around the world that were affected by this form of hate towards our community, I must say that we have not let hate win thus far, and continue to spread love and prayers for one another and for the other families and victims that were either there that night, or affected in some way. ‘‘It has been a true honor in seeing how close everyone has come together. It shows our strength as a whole and the love that we can all provide for one another in a time of need. ‘‘The continuance of all of this gives me hope for my future in the commu-nity and in the world. May God bless you and everyone out there. ‘‘I’ve become a stronger person since then, and if my strength can help oth-ers, I want to. ‘‘Thank you for hearing my words. ‘‘Joshua McGill.’’ Mr. Speaker, I yield again to the gen-tleman from Florida (Mr. S
OTO), my colleague. Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Florida, Congress-woman D
EMINGS , my colleague, for reading the letter of Joshua. How in-spiring it really was. Next we have a statement from our dear friend, Eric Rollings, who is one of our supervisors of the Orange County Soil and Water Board, and who also is one of our only openly gay elected offi-cials. ‘‘As an openly gay elected official and Orlando resident for 27 years, I know the city and Orange County very well. We are a loving, caring commu-nity that supports the rights and pur-suit of happiness for all of our resi-dents. One year ago this very day, we were devastated to feel the loss of so many lives from every part of all of Or-lando. Yes, Pulse by name was a gay nightclub, but it was attended by ev-eryone and all walks of life felt safe dancing and having a good time for more than a decade. ‘‘As the night became dawn and the horror of the extent of what happened became painfully available by every media outlet, I didn’t need to listen to news reports because I live right across the street from Pulse. The sound of the blades from the helicopters above my house cut through June air, day after day, looking for a better camera angle. Out of so much pain came so much love. ‘‘Immediately Orlando went into ac-tion. The outpouring of love from ev-erywhere in the world is still so incred-ible. The help came from faith-based organizations, the small stores, cor-porate America. Most of all, it came out of love and our neighbors. I hope this never happens to your community or any community, but it most likely will. Let me offer some advice. ‘‘Love thy neighbor, know your neighbor, and take care of your neigh-bor. Do not wait until another tragedy. Talk to your children about violence. Let’s help the persons that suffer from mental illnesses. ‘‘There is a significance and real dif-ference between a city that is tolerant, a city accepting, and a city that em-braces the LGBTQ and all its commu-nities and individuals within those communities. I am proud to live in a city and a county that embraces! We are Orlando Strong and we are Orlando United.’’ Mrs. DEMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I would like to share this last survival letter for tonight. It is from Eric Borrero. It says: ‘‘Dear Congress, ‘‘It is to me how fast one year has gone by. The horrifying emotions and feeling of that night have not fleeted. Instead, they lay dormant in the re-cesses of my mind, bubbling up like lava in a moment’s notice from unfore-seen triggers. ‘‘It is like living on a roller coaster: having great moments over the past year, making things feel absolutely normal; and extreme lows, feeling as if I will never come out of the darkness. ‘‘Even through the disturbing images of the past, I am optimistic about the future I have ahead of me. I can fully grasp that life will never go back to the normal that I once knew, but this experience has helped me focus on what is needed in the world. That is love and inclusion for all people. ‘‘Over the past year, I have had the most amazing support system of friends and family, who have been there for me as I have cried and battled the demons that lay with me when I sleep. ‘‘These feelings have not changed since that night, but I remain positive and stand with my LGBTQ and Latinx brothers and sisters for a better future for everyone. ‘‘Regards, ‘‘Eric Borrero.’’ Mr. Speaker, I would like to share that, today, Representative SOTO, Rep-resentative S
TEPHANIE MURPHY , and I introduced a resolution to recognize and mark one year since the Pulse tragedy. We were joined by 143 Mem-bers of Congress, Democrats and Re-publicans, who are standing to show the community of Orlando that we stand with them in support; that Con-gress will not forget the victims, the survivors, the first responders, and the communities that are shattered by the hands of domestic terrorists; and that we will do everything we can to pre-vent future mass shootings, and take care of the people who are left standing in the wake of these tragedies. Mr. Speaker, our community de-clared June 12, 2017, Orlando United Day, a day of love and kindness. All across our community, people are com-ing together to honor the victims by volunteering and attending vigils and memorials. We are a community that will never forget. We won’t forget those 49 inno-cent men and women who were sons, daughters, mothers, husbands, wives, students, teachers, entrepreneurs, and dreamers, who had a lot of life left to live. We are a community that will continue to honor these men and women, not through our words, but through our actions. Mr. Speaker, I thank God for Rep-resentative S
OTO, for his service to our community. I am honored to serve with him in the United States Congress. I appreciate the work that he has done for the last several years throughout our community. I was honored to share this Special Order with him. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. S
OTO). Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, I include in the R

Mrs. DEMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
f 
ISSUES OF THE DAY The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-uary 3, 2017, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. G
OHMERT ) for 30 minutes. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I appre-ciate my colleagues’ tribute to the vic-tims of that terrible tragic murder spree by a radical Islamist who said he was doing it for the Islamic State. The attorney general herself indicated that we have a tape of him saying he is doing it for the Islamic State. There is nothing that justifies such an outrageous murder of even one inno-cent victim, much less the dozens that were mowed down by what could nor-mally, in the old days, be said to have been a crazed killer. But he wasn’t so much crazed as he was driven by a rad-ical Islamic agenda, the same radical Islamic agenda that caused 30 million, mostly Muslim, Egyptians to rise up. Coming near the anniversary of that event in Egypt, the greatest peaceful uprising in the history of the world, the Egyptians said: We don’t want a Muslim brother, we don’t want a rad-ical Islamist controlling our country. It was rather tragic that the shoot-er—and I don’t want to give him any more notoriety than necessary, so I won’t mention his name—was not a lone wolf, as is so often supposed and we were led to believe repeatedly dur-ing the Obama administration. But as Reporter Patrick Poole indicates, he was yet another known wolf. The FBI knew he was and the local law enforce-ment knew who he was, which brings me to a point I wanted to discuss to-night. Robert Mueller is the special pros-ecutor who now needs to resign. He was the FBI Director that had the FBI training materials purged so FBI agents could not know what they were looking for in a radical Islamist. He changed the training. He purged it to please the Council on American-Is-lamic Relations. As one intelligence officer said: We blinded ourselves of the ability to see our enemy. That is what FBI Director Robert Mueller did. When challenged in a hearing where I was questioning him over the pitiful investigation of the Tsarnaev older brother after Russia had notified us twice in the United States of his radicalization, after the second time, finally, ho-hum, Mueller’s FBI not being adequately trained to recognize what a radical Islamist believes, how they act, what they do, what they are studying, what they are memorizing, what they wear, what their personal appearance is, they are not trained to recognize, they didn’t know what they were looking for. b2100 They didn’t know what they were looking for. They go out. The best we can find out, they talked to Tsarnaev, and he said, ‘‘No, I’m not a terrorist,’’ basically. So, not knowing what else to do, since Mueller had destroyed the proper training to recognize radical Islamists, they went and talked to his mother who assured them, ‘‘No, he’s a good boy; he’s not a terrorist,’’ and the re-sult was people murdered and maimed at the Boston Marathon. The result of the FBI going after those who would try to teach others what real radical Islam was, the results of dumbing down the FBI and their ability to spot people who wanted to kill others in the name of Allah: people killed at Boston, people killed in Or-lando. And it wasn’t any more the fault of guns in Orlando than it was the fault of a white truck in London. It is the people who use those weap-ons to kill; otherwise, it is a matter of defense, the great equalizer. The truck is a great means of conveyance. But Robert Mueller has created prob-lems for this country, and there are a lot of people that are buried now. Per-haps they would, perhaps they would not be deceased if Robert Mueller had done his job and had been as concerned about finding radical Islamists in America as he was—as he told me, they didn’t go to the Boston mosque where Tsarnaev surely gave evidence of being radicalized. That is not his words. I said: You didn’t even go to the mosque to find out, to talk, to investigate. The best he could do is come back and say: We did go to that mosque as part of our outreach program, part of the lovely sit down, chat, have some tea, whatever—I don’t know what they had, water, whatever it was—make merry, chat. While Tsarnaev was plot-ting to murder many people, as many as he could at the Boston Marathon, Bob Mueller and his FBI are making merry at the Boston mosque that he did not even know who started it. I asked him that. He didn’t know. I said: Did you even know that al- Hamoudi started that mosque? No, he didn’t know that. Al-Hamoudi is doing 23 years—23 years—in Federal prison for supporting terrorism. And as I un-derstand, I had heard that that was more to the credit not of Mueller’s folks, but of help from England. How ironic is that? But I see that I have a friend here. I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. ARRINGTON ). 
HONORING THE LIFE OF COACH SPIKE DYKES  
Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I love everything about west Texas. I love the beautiful sunsets and the starry nights. I love that our farmers and ranchers feed and clothe the American people. I love that we produce more fossil and renewable energy than any other re-gion in the United States. People from all over the country rely on west Texas to make America great, but the greatest contribution from our region is our people. The people of west Texas have a distinct friendliness, a can-do spirit, a humble demeanor, a unique sense of humor; and on April 10, 2017, we lost one of our very own who embodied these attributes like no one else. Former head football coach at Texas Tech and favorite son of west Texas, Spike Dykes carved his legacy into the bedrock of our region and into the hearts of hundreds of student athletes and thousands of fans across this coun-try. A small town kid from Ballinger, Texas, who achieved his wildest dreams of becoming a Division I head football coach, Coach Dykes went on to lead the Red Raiders to seven straight bowl seasons and was later inducted into the Texas Sports Hall of Fame. I had the honor of calling Spike Dykes ‘‘Coach’’ for a short time when I walked on the Texas Tech football team, and later I had the honor of call-ing him my friend. We are all saddened by his passing, and our prayers are with his children and my friends, Rick, BeBe, Sonny, and their families. Thank you, Coach, for your colorful wit and country wisdom. Thank you for leaving a legacy of love for people and all things west Texas. Thank you for teaching us that in life, like the game of football, it is not whether you win or lose; it is who you are; it is how you play the game. God doesn’t make them any better than you, Coach. God bless. Mr. GOHMERT. I thank my friend from Texas, a great, noble tribute. I wish that it were I who was stand-ing here to say glowing things about people that have been running the FBI; but President Trump as a candidate said he wanted to come drain the swamp, and the more we dig, the more it appears to be a swirling cesspool up here.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H4849 June 12, 2017 
We had a man who had been running the FBI who came before the Senate, a Senate committee and testified that he did a memo after talking to President Trump, that he had never felt the need to do a memo after talking to Presi-dent Obama or President Bush or to take notes like he did; but he was afraid that Trump might lie sometime in the future, and so he felt it impor-tant to do a memo, to write some notes. That is what he said. Rather incredibly, he didn’t find a need to do a memo after Attorney Gen-eral Loretta Lynch, according to him, told him what really has to be a lie. She knew that Hillary Clinton was being investigated for a crime. It was a criminal case, a criminal investigation. She directed FBI Director Comey not to use ‘‘investigation,’’ use ‘‘matter.’’ Well, it was an investigation, and to say anything other than that was a lie. But how ironic that he was afraid Trump might lie in the future; where-as, he had an Attorney General that made him feel a little uneasy, but he didn’t write any notes. So what about his credibility? Well, he said he took those notes as a recollection refreshed. And those of us that have tried cases, been judges, you know, we know that past recollec-tion recorded can be an exception to the hearsay rule. But if he signed an FBI employment agreement, which people are supposed to sign, it should have included these words: ‘‘All infor-mation acquired by me in connection with my official duties with the FBI and all official material to which I have access remain the property of the United States of America. I will sur-render upon demand by the FBI, or upon my separation from the FBI, all materials containing FBI information in my possession.’’ That means that if an FBI agent, Di-rector, FBI employee makes notes, makes a memorandum to refresh his recollection later, it is not a personal piece of property any more than what Sandy Berger stuffed in his socks was personal property to him. It doesn’t matter that he prepared it. It was done while being paid by the FBI, on FBI time, regarding FBI matters. As FBI Director, he was talking to the Presi-dent. How ironic, also, we have no memos after President Obama made the basic statement that he didn’t think Hillary should be prosecuted. We haven’t heard any outcry from the great Director Comey about how wrong that was. What an obstruction of justice by President Obama. We didn’t hear any of that. I mean, that is about as direct as you can get when the President was talking on television and told the world, and the fact that you may say it out front to the world doesn’t make it any less intimidating or directional than if you look somebody in the face one on one and tell them. It is not a defense to say it on television, and yet he wasn’t con-cerned by that. So we start looking a little deeper since it appears he wasn’t being honest about being his personal property, and you would like to think that he had a good legal education, but Alan Dershowitz has made clear that the FBI—there is nothing wrong if the President tells him we are not pros-ecuting this individual for this crime. I am pardoning him here and now. He has the power. All power that Director Comey has is derived from his boss, the President. So why would he go back and do a memo and consult or, I believe the more prop-er word is ‘‘collude’’ with others at the Justice Department about what the President said? Because, make no mistake, if any of those individuals at the Justice De-partment who were colluding with James Comey after he met with the President, if they thought there was an obstruction of justice and they didn’t report it as they did not, then they committed a crime. So why would they not report it? It appears there can only be one an-swer. Surely they did not intend to commit a crime by misprision of a fel-ony if they really believed it were ob-struction. So it appears, since they clearly did not think that there was obstruction of justice in the Presi-dent’s use of the word ‘‘hope,’’ then they must have surely applauded James Comey’s writing of a memo, writing of notes so that he could pull it out later and use it to go after the President. There can be no other rea-son that he did what he did. He either committed a crime by not reporting obstruction as soon as he possibly could, or he was colluding with his colleagues to bring down the President of the United States. So, the more we find as we dig, the more of a cesspool it appears to be here in Wash-ington. Mollie Hemingway has done an ex-traordinary job today from The Fed-eralist. She goes through, she has an article: ‘‘James Comey Has a Long His-tory of Questionable Obstruction Cases.’’ I wish I had remembered these, and I feel a bit guilty that I didn’t realize at the time these things were going on, the miscarriage of justice that was oc-curring at the hands of James Comey and Bob Mueller. She brings up Frank Quattrone, ‘‘a banker who Comey pursued relent-lessly on banking-related charges with-out fruition. But while he couldn’t find any wrongdoing or criminal conduct, he went after him for supposed ‘ob-struction of justice’ because of a single ambiguous email. Sound familiar? ‘‘Before he was indicted’’—talking about Quattrone, before Quattrone was indicted—‘‘Comey made fall state-ments about Quattrone and his intent. The first trial ended in a hung jury, but the second one got a conviction. ‘‘That conviction was overturned in 2006. Quattrone was so scarred by the harassment’’—by Comey—‘‘he began funding projects designed to help inno-cent people who are victims of prosecu-torial overreach or other problems.’’ b2115 ‘‘He said his motivation for sup-porting such projects was that at the very moment he was found guilty in the second trial, he realized there must be innocent people in prisons who lacked the financial resources to fight for justice. He also started the Quattrone Center for the Fair Adminis-tration of Justice at the University of Pennsylvania Law School. ‘‘Quattrone has noted, with interest, the disparities in how he was treated by Comey for a single ambiguous email compared to his handling of Hillary Clinton’s email server scandal,’’ with thousands, tens of thousands of email. How about Martha Stewart? ‘‘You might remember Martha Stewart being sent to jail. You might not remember that James Comey was the man who put her there, and not because he was able to charge her for anything he began investigating her for. The origi-nal investigation was into whether Stewart had engaged in insider trading. They didn’t even try to get her on that charge. Gene Healy wrote about it in 2004, warning about Federal prosecu-torial overreach.’’ By Comey, of course. He said, ‘‘Comey didn’t charge Stewart with in-sider trading. Instead, he claimed that Stewart’s public protestations of inno-cence were designed to prop up the stock price of her own company . . . and thus constituted securities fraud. Stewart was also charged with making false statements to Federal officials in-vestigating the insider trading charge—a charge they never pursued. In essence, Stewart was prosecuted for ‘having misled people by denying hav-ing committed a crime with which she was not charged,’ as Cato Institute Senior Fellow Alan Reynolds put it. ‘‘The pursuit was described as ‘vin-dictive’ in The New York Times and ‘petty and vindictive’ in The Daily Beast. ‘‘But she still served a 5-month pris-on sentence.’’ Stephen Hatfill, and this is one that really gets me to my core. I did not re-member the outcome, and I feel guilty, but I was handling felony cases back in Texas at the time. ‘‘The FBI absolutely bungled its in-vestigation into the Anthrax attacker who struck after the 9/11 terrorist at-tacks. Carl Cannon goes through this story well, and it’s worth reading for how it involves both Comey and his dear ‘friend’ and current special coun-sel Robert Mueller. The FBI tried—in the media—its case against Hatfill. Their actual case ended up being thrown out by the courts: ‘‘Comey and Mueller badly bungled the biggest case they ever handled. They botched the investigation of the 2001 anthrax letter attacks that took five lives and infected 17 other people, shut down the U.S. Capitol and Wash-ington’s mail system, solidified the

Bush administration’s antipathy for Iraq, and eventually, when the facts fi-nally came out, made the FBI look feckless, incompetent, and easily ma-nipulated by outside political pressure. ‘‘More from Cannon, recounting how messed up the attempt to convict Ste-ven Hatfill for a crime he didn’t com-mit was: ‘‘In truth, Hatfill was an implausible suspect from the outset. He was a vi-rologist who never handled anthrax, which is a bacterium. Ivins, by con-trast, shared ownership of anthrax pat-ents, was diagnosed as having paranoid personality disorder, and had a habit of stalking and threatening people with anonymous letters—including the woman who provided the long-ignored tip to the FBI. So what evidence did the FBI have against Hatfill? There was none, so the agency did a Hail Mary, importing two bloodhounds from California whose handlers claimed could sniff the scent of the killer on the anthrax-tainted letters. These dogs were shown to Hatfill, who promptly petted them. When the dogs responded favorably, their handlers told the FBI that they had ‘alerted’ on Hatfill and that he must be the killer. ‘‘When Bush administration officials were worried about the quality of the case Mueller and Comey had, the two men assured them. ‘Comey was ‘‘abso-lutely certain’’ that it was Hatfill,’ Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz said. ‘‘Such certitude seems to be Comey’s default position in his professional life,’’ Cannon wrote. He shouldn’t have been certain in this case. After the six years the FBI spent destroying his life, they settled a $4.6 million lawsuit he filed and officially exonerated him.’’ Good work, James Comey and Bob Mueller. You ruined the life of a man with no evidence at all, but told the Bush administration, oh, we are abso-lutely certain this is the guy. What about Scooter Libby, and Ju-dith Miller? I didn’t remember this: ‘‘After pressuring John Ashcroft—I am reading through the article—‘‘After pressuring John Ashcroft to recuse himself from the responsibility on the grounds of potential conflicts of inter-est, Comey gave Patrick Fitzgerald, his close personal friend and godfather to one of his children, the role of special counsel into the investigation of the leak of Valerie Plame’s identity as a CIA employee. Some conflicts of inter-est are more important to Comey than others, apparently. ‘‘Fitzgerald immediately discovered that Deputy Secretary of State Rich-ard Armitage was the leaker. Of course, the FBI and Department of Jus-tice had known that all along, so Comey’s push for a special counsel is . . . intriguing.’’ There was no reason for a special counsel. The FBI knew it. The Depart-ment of Justice knew it. They pushed for one anyway. Comey was at the mid-dle of it. Mueller, you know, his close friend, of course, but Fitzgerald was the god-father of one of his children, for heav-en’s sake. ‘‘The 3-year investigation was a cloud over the Bush administration’’— which didn’t seem to bother Comey at all, oh, of course not—‘‘and resulted in nothing but the jailing of a jour-nalist’’—who was protecting a source, even though they didn’t need it. Wow, how mean-spirited—‘‘. . . and a dubi-ous prosecution of Scooter Libby for, wait for it, obstruction of justice. Comey was unconcerned about the jailing of journalists and never threat-ened to resign over this infringement on First Amendment freedoms.’’ And it talks about Hillary Clinton in this article, but I am telling you, Mr. Speaker, this is a scary time in Amer-ica. You have this article from John Hinderaker, June 10, Power Line, quoting Senator W
ARNER : ‘‘And so, in all of your experience’’— he is talking to Director Comey—‘‘this was the only President that you felt like, in every meeting, you needed to document, because at some point, using your words, he might put out a non-truthful representation of that meeting?’’ Comey says: ‘‘That’s right, Senator.’’ He goes on: ‘‘. . . I had a one-on-one meeting with President Bush about a very important and difficult national security matter. ‘‘I didn’t write a memo documenting that conversation either—sent a quick email to my staff to let them know there was something going on, but I didn’t feel, with President Bush, the need to document it in that way, again, because of—the combination of those factors just wasn’t present with either President Bush or Obama.’’ This article goes on to point out that is simply not true. That was a lie. And whoever remembered that a book named ‘‘Angler’’ was written by Barton Gellman, with Comey as his big chief source, went so far as to be able to quote the conversation after work-ing with Comey, and in the footnotes from the ‘‘Angler,’’ it says: ‘‘Quotations from the Bush-Comey con-versations are taken verbatim from un-classified notes describing Comey’s re-port of the meeting shortly afterward.’’ But Comey’s email that he says he just let them know that there was something going on, here is what he said in his email, because it was print-ed in ‘‘Angler.’’ ‘‘The President just took me into his private office for a 15-minute, one-on- one talk. Told him he was being misled and poorly served. We had a very full and frank exchange. Don’t know that either of us can see a way out. He promised he would shut down 5/6 if Congress didn’t fix FISA. Told him Mueller was about to resign. He just pulled Bob into his office.’’ Yeah, he didn’t just say something was going on. He told him what hap-pened. He memorialized that visit with a note, and then in the book, it is word- for-word, according to Mr. Comey, what was said, and it makes him to be out all American, clean, honest, up-standing, fine law enforcement officer, when it turns out he was anything but that. ‘‘The real pattern,’’ as it says here at the end of the article is that, ‘‘Comey is a snake in the grass who creates ten-dentious, self-serving memos that can later be used to cover his own rear end or to discredit presidents, but only if they are Republicans.’’ Gellman’s phrasing was clumsy in the article, but this is serious stuff that it turns out, oh, four members of Mueller’s team have donated to Demo-crats. Well, isn’t that cozy? Comey closely coordinated with Mueller on Trump testimony. We heard from the FBI Director that he actually did collude with other members at the Jus-tice Department. It is so clear. There are people at the Justice Department out to get Presi-dent Trump, out to get Attorney Gen-eral Sessions. They are out to get every one of them, and just the way they did, the man they said there was no question was the culprit in killing people with anthrax, that was a lie. And they don’t care who gets hurt. It is time to dismiss the special pros-ecutor; see if we really need one be-cause now we know that Comey manip-ulated the system exactly the way he manipulated it when he told John Ashcroft he should recuse himself so he could appoint Patrick Fitzgerald, give him the appointment, that is. Enough is enough of Comey, of Mueller. It is time to drain the swamp, and they will go down the drain when we do. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

.S3381 Vol. 163 WASHINGTON, MONDAY, JUNE 12, 2017 No. 99 
Senate 
The Senate met at 4 p.m. and was called to order by the President pro tempore (Mr. H
ATCH ). 
f 
PRAYER The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-fered the following prayer: Let us pray. Almighty God, great is Your faithful-ness. We find strength in difficult times because our thoughts about Your mercy and providential care sustain us. Lord, guide our lawmakers to make You their sure foundation. From this foundation, may they gain strength for today and bright hope for tomorrow. Help them to base their hope on Your exceedingly great and precious prom-ises, as You do for them more than they can ask or imagine. May they have such an inner sense of Your pres-ence that they will desire to commune with You throughout this day. And, Lord, bless our incoming sum-mer page class. May these young peo-ple increase intellectually, physically, socially, and spiritually. We pray in Your great Name. Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The President pro tempore led the Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Repub-lic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. E
RNST ). The majority leader is recog-nized. 
f 
SANCTIONS LEGISLATION Mr. M
CCONNELL. Madam President, last week, the Senate voted on an over-whelmingly bipartisan basis to advance the Iran sanctions bill currently before us, and we will take another vote today to proceed to that bill. I want to thank the chairs and ranking members of the Foreign Relations and Banking Com-mittees—Chairman CORKER , Chairman C
RAPO —for their efforts to craft addi-tional, much-needed sanctions on Rus-sia as well. I would encourage Members of both parties to keep working to-gether so we can pass the critical Iran sanctions legislation very soon. 
f 
HEALTHCARE LEGISLATION Mr. M
CCONNELL. Madam President, 7 years ago, Senate Democrats and the Obama administration forced ObamaCare on the American people, but ObamaCare never actually lived up to what Democrats had promised. From rising costs to shrinking choices and collapsing markets, the problems associated with ObamaCare grew across the country as the years passed, leaving the American people to lit-erally pick up the pieces. ObamaCare’s years-long legacy of failure will only get worse unless we act. Consider the latest examples of how it is threatening to hurt more Americans. In Washington State, peo-ple in two counties just learned they could have zero insurance options under ObamaCare plans next year. Thousands of Ohioans across 18 coun-ties just found out they could also be left with absolutely zero choices under ObamaCare. Iowans could be left with-out a single major insurance option to choose from statewide as well. And in Nebraska, nearly 100,000 residents learned they could be left with just one insurance option on the ObamaCare ex-changes next year or potentially none at all. At the rate things are going, Ameri-cans living in nearly half of all coun-ties could be left with just one or even zero insurance options under ObamaCare next year. Think about that. Millions of people in nearly half of all the counties across America are at risk of having no options or a single option of insurance plans because of ObamaCare. Worse still, as choices continue to drop, premiums keep rising, often by double digits, meaning those lucky enough to have a choice under ObamaCare may not even be able to af-ford the plan they select. It is a fact underlined by reports released just this afternoon by the Centers for Medicare and Medicare Services, or CMS. These reports show that hundreds of thou-sands of Americans who selected an ObamaCare plan ended up canceling their coverage after just a few weeks, and the most common reason they cited for doing so was because it was too expensive. Is it any wonder? As an-other groundbreaking report revealed last month, premiums have on average doubled—and in some cases even tri-pled—in the vast majority of States on the Federal exchange since ObamaCare’s full enactment in 2013. You would think the Democrats would want to work with us now to clean up the years-long mess they cre-ated. Instead, they are defending the status quo or trying to shift the blame for the failures of their own law—a law Democrats designed, a law Democrats forced on our country, a law Democrats defended year after year as it hurt Americans over and over. There is just no serious way to try to spin these years of ObamaCare failures at this late date. It is also clear that the status quo is simply unsustainable and demands ac-tion. That is why Republican Senators have been working hard on solutions that could help rescue American fami-lies who have been hurt by this law’s failures. Members will keep working this week because bringing relief from ObamaCare may not be easy, but it is necessary. We are going to keep work-ing hard to get this done. Madam President, I suggest the ab-sence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES3382 June 12, 2017 
The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized. 
f 
ANNIVERSARY OF THE PULSE NIGHTCLUB MASS SHOOTING IN ORLANDO Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, before I begin, I would like to take a moment to remember the victims of the shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando that occurred 1 year ago today. It was the deadliest shooting by a single gunman in our Nation’s his-tory. Forty-nine Americans died that night, and 53 more were injured. They were children, parents, sisters, broth-ers, and friends. They went out that night to celebrate with their friends and instead came face to face with a soul twisted by an inexplicable hate. The best way I can see to honor their memory is to honor them with action. We should redouble our efforts to make this country safer from the scourge of terrorism and gun violence to ensure that our schools and our churches, our theaters and our nightclubs are safe places where all Americans can be who they truly are. Let that be our mission as we remember the 49 victims of the Orlando attack and keep their families in our prayers. 
f 
SANCTIONS LEGISLATION Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, on Russia sanctions, soon we will move to a cloture vote on the motion to proceed to the Iran sanctions legislation. The two leaders, Chairmen C
ORKER and C
RAPO , the two ranking members, B
ROWN and C ARDIN , continue to nego-tiate a package of strong Russia sanc-tions that can be offered as an amend-ment to the bill. I am hopeful we can come to an agreement soon, one that at the very least includes legislation put forward by Senators G
RAHAM and C
ARDIN that would establish a process for Congress to review any Russia-re-lated sanctions relief. Senator M
CCAIN, along with Senator C
ARDIN , has also submitted an amendment for tough, new sanctions, which I very much sup-port. Democrats feel strongly that Rus-sia sanctions should move alongside Iran sanctions, and we are prepared to do what we can to make sure we get a vote on a good amendment and hope-fully a bipartisan one. 
f 
SPECIAL COUNSEL MUELLER Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, as we continue to grapple with last week’s testimony from former Director Comey, it seems the new strategy by some on the right is now to question the credibility of Special Counsel Mueller. Already, former Speaker Gingrich and others have said negative things about Mueller just weeks after praising his selection. They know that Mr. Mueller is the man now responsible for following up on Mr. Comey’s testi-mony so the hard right is trying to dis-credit him in advance. They know they can’t debate the facts or the issues or defend the actions of the White House on the merits, so what do they do? They attack the referee and try to be-smirch the reputation of someone like Mr. Mueller. Mr. Mueller is a man of integrity. That is agreed to by just about every-body. He has devoted his entire career to his country. He came out of private life to do a job on behalf of his country and be right down the middle. Even At-torney General Jeff Sessions has praised Mr. Mueller for his service and credibility, saying his ‘‘integrity is un-doubted,’’ as is his ‘‘experience and love of country.’’ Those are Jeff Ses-sions’ words. Now the political right has pulled out their partisan knives to try and defame his reputation. It is a shameful, shameful ploy. The right must be afraid of what Mr. Mueller is going to find. I would ask Speaker Gingrich a question. Is he afraid of what Mr. Mueller is going to find out? Is that why he is attacking his reputation? The baseless attacks on former Director Mueller ring hollow. Former Director Mueller has been hailed as a paragon of public service by people of all political stripes. This country comes to a low point when that kind of attack is issued. Despite what Speaker Gingrich may try to imply, we should have every con-fidence that he will investigate the matters at hand with integrity and thoroughness. I can tell you one thing, the little bit I know about him, Speaker Gingrich’s attack and attacks like that will not do a thing to deter Director Mueller from finding out the truth. f 
HEALTHCARE LEGISLATION Mr. SCHUMER. Finally, Madam President, a word on healthcare. The Republicans continue to work on their healthcare bill behind closed doors, and now it seems they are look-ing for a vote on a final bill before the July 4th recess. To all of America, this should be a red alert. This is not a drill. This is a red alert. In a very short time, maybe only 2 weeks, the Republican majority may try to jam through a healthcare bill that no one in America has seen— no committee hearings, no public de-bate. According to some reports, the Republicans will not publicly release the text until the very last moment. What Senate Republicans are doing on healthcare is one of the most out-rageous examples of legislative mal-practice in decades. Senator MCCONNELL , who believes in regular order, ought to think long and hard before he does this because it will not go down as a fine moment in his-tory for him, for his party, or for the Senate. This is the party that chanted ‘‘Read the bill, read the bill,’’ when ObamaCare was being debated, and now they will not even show the bill. Democrats spent over a year on the Affordable Care Act, the ObamaCare bill, with multiple committee hearings. We actually accepted dozens of Repub-lican amendments. Show us the bill. Senators G
RASSLEY , HATCH , and others had amendments that were added to the bill. Show us the bill so we have the same opportunity. Why would the majority so starkly depart from the normal legislative pro-cedure? Why would they seek to pass in the dark of night a bill that affects one-sixth of the economy, millions of people’s lives? Leader M
CCONNELL used to stress the importance of regular order in the Sen-ate. Why is he proceeding with the Re-publican healthcare bill in the most ir-regular way? I know why. It is because Republicans don’t want the American people to see the bill. They are so ashamed of their healthcare plan, they want to pass it in the dead of night, with no hearings, no amendments— rushing it through. It is not a bill they are proud of. If they were proud of the bill, they would say: Let’s debate it. They are ashamed of the bill. They know they have the hard right on their backs saying: You have to do something. But at least have the decency, the honor, a little bit of courage to put the bill out there and let us debate it and let us amend it. The Republicans don’t want the American people to know their bill will likely gut Medicaid to finance a mas-sive tax break for the wealthiest of Americans, hurt the healthcare of av-erage Americans, middle-class Ameri-cans, elderly Americans, those who abuse opioids, so they can have a big tax break for people whose income is above $200,000 a year. The Republicans don’t want the American people to know their bill will make older and sicker Americans pay more for less coverage. Someone 63 or 64 could see their premiums go up three, four, five times, while million-aires and billionaires get a break on their taxes. If it were my bill, I would be ashamed of it too. Thank God it is not. Republicans don’t want the American people to know their bill will cause their costs to go up, their care to go down, while leaving millions of Ameri-cans without health insurance. Why are Republicans working so hard in se-cret for a bill they are clearly not proud of? Because the ideologues on the hard right are pushing them to just repeal and give a tax break to the rich. It is because they repeated the polit-ical slogan ‘‘repeal and replace’’ to their base for 7 years without coming

up with a workable healthcare plan when the day came that they were ac-tually in charge. Now we have this Frankenstein bill from the House, assembled from spare parts intended to buy off different Re-publican constituencies, and the Re-publican majority in the Senate, which we thought at one point would show more honor and more courage, seems to be taking the same approach. They are working on modifying the bill so it can get 50 votes in their caucus, no matter what the impact is on the coun-try. Most of the devastating con-sequences of the House bill will re-main. Mark my words, my Republican friends, the Republican Party will re-gret the day it passes a bill that looks anything like what is now being con-sidered. Every independent analysis has shown that TrumpCare will dev-astate sicker, older Americans, folks in rural areas, the working poor, younger couples and middle-aged couples who have a parent in a nursing home. It will raise costs on middle-class fami-lies, and those struggling to get there will be left with a healthcare system that works only for the healthiest and wealthiest among us, and the Repub-licans will own every last shred of the responsibility. They will own it com-pletely because there has not been a scrap of bipartisan input on the bill, not a single Democratic amendment, not a single hearing, and no one even knows exactly what the bill looks like. A senior GOP aide said in the paper today that they weren’t releasing the bill text because ‘‘we are not stupid.’’ I challenge that claim. Keeping a bill this bad holed up in secret and then forcing it down the throats of the American people is much more stupid than simply showing the bill, allowing it to be vetted and amended, and allow-ing it to be improved. It is much more stupid. The Republicans are going down a dark path, down a dangerous road that will have devastating consequences for their party and of course for the Amer-ican people. Believe me, this is not what Democrats want. We Democrats are actually willing to take on some of the responsibility. We are willing to work with our Repub-lican colleagues to make improve-ments to our healthcare system and to fix problems with the existing law. That involves some political risk. We are willing to take on that risk to try and help more Americans afford healthcare. The Republicans are doing just the opposite by hiding their bill under lock and key. They are trying to avoid the risk of public backlash on a bill that, at least the polling shows, has the sup-port of a mere sliver of the American people—18 percent. It will backfire. It will do potentially irrevocable damage to their party and more importantly to our country. The Republicans ought to turn back before it is too late. They will rue the day they rushed this bill, in the dark of night, that does so much damage to the American people. I yield the floor.

HEALTHCARE LEGISLATION  
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, be-fore he leaves the floor, I want to say to my friend, the Democratic leader, among his other attributes, he now claims omniscience. He knows every-thing—even about things that haven’t even been written yet, and I, for one, appreciate as a Republican his concern about the Republican Party. I would challenge his memory be-cause I was here in 2010, when 60 Demo-crats in the Senate jammed through ObamaCare, a bill that we frankly need to save the American people from as it begins to melt down. As the distinguished Presiding Offi-cer from Iowa knows, there is not a single carrier in Iowa that is willing to sell ObamaCare insurance on the ex-changes because they are simply bleed-ing money. Mr. SCHUMER. Will my good friend and gym mate from Texas yield for a question? Mr. CORNYN. I will yield for a ques-tion. Mr. SCHUMER. Is omniscience a comment of all-knowing, and if I don’t know what the bill is all about, then I couldn’t be omniscient; isn’t that true? Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I would say to my friend from New York that he is omniscient if he claims to know the content of a bill that has not yet been voted on or agreed upon by Republicans in the Senate. I would just put that in the same category as his other advice to folks on this side of the aisle and again challenge his memory to how we got here in the first place. I was here on Christmas Eve when we voted. I ended up voting against, but Democrats voted to jam ObamaCare through this body and on a strictly party-line vote. The fact is, ObamaCare is failing millions of people because if they have access to coverage at all, many of them have seen their pre-miums go up an average of 105 percent since 2013. That is the average in the 30-plus States that carry ObamaCare insurance on the healthcare ex-changes—a 105-percent increase. Many of them have also seen their deductibles get so big that they cannot even really use the insurance they have because basically they are effectively self-insured. So I take with a grain of salt the comments from my friend from New York that somehow we are doing some-thing that is so horrible when we are trying to rescue the American people and clean up the mess our Democratic friends created when they jammed ObamaCare through on a party-line vote. If they were serious about it, what they would do is accept our invi-tation to work with us to improve healthcare for all Americans. It would be much better if we could do this on a bipartisan basis. It would certainly be more durable and be sustained for much longer than things done strictly on party-line votes. Yet, in the absence of any real help from our Democratic friends, who just seem to be standing idly by and not lifting a finger to help the people being hurt by ObamaCare today, we are going to have to do the best we can with the hand we have been dealt on behalf of the people whom we represent. Madam President, on another mat-ter, as a global leader of state-spon-sored terrorism, Iran continues to threaten the very existence of the na-tion of Israel and destabilize the Mid-dle East by creating a breeding ground for violence and hatred. For the past several years, the United States and our allies have at-tempted to contain Iran, often to no avail. For one, President Obama’s lop-sided nuclear deal left a zero imprint on Iran’s terrorist activities. So last week the senior Senator from Ten-nessee, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, intro-duced legislation to apply impactful and powerful sanctions on the nation of Iran. This bill will give the President the ability to block any trade that could benefit Iran’s ballistic missile programs or support its military build-up. I plan to introduce a bipartisan amendment to this bill that would tar-get Mahan Air. This is Iran’s largest commercial airline that doubles as the preferred mode of transportation for terrorists and their weapons. That is right. It is a civilian airline, but it is actually used to facilitate terrorism and to transport weapons. Mahan Air not only supports the efforts of the Quds Force, which is a special unit of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard

Corps, but it supports Hezbollah as well. This terrorist airline is a conduit for personnel, weapons, and a violent ideology throughout the region. Unfortunately, despite its proven transgressions, Mahan Air continues to expand international operations by adding more international airports to its flight patterns, including several in Europe. This is an obvious threat to the safety and security of the people where these planes are allowed to land. Not only are the goods they transport a cause for concern, but their very presence is a security risk to Ameri-cans who fly in and out of airports at which a Mahan aircraft may land. Through all of this, of course, Iran continues to support their terrorist ac-tivities, indeed carrying on under the guise of commercial civilian aircraft flights. My amendment would require the De-partment of Homeland Security to compile and make public a list of air-ports at which Mahan Air has recently landed and then require the Depart-ment of Homeland Security to assess what security measures should be added. We have a duty to protect American citizens, and I am thankful that Chair-man C
ORKER will bring this legislation to the floor. The fight against ter-rorism is multifaceted, and it is not easy, but we can start by targeting state sponsors of terrorism like Iran with economic sanctions while we strengthen our military and continue the great tradition of American leader-ship around the world. 
HEALTHCARE LEGISLATION  
Finally, Madam President, let me re-turn to where I began—to the issue of ObamaCare. There is a lot of work to be done here at home as well. I know it is easy for us to get mired in the ‘‘how,’’ but it is also important for us to remember why we are repealing ObamaCare and why we are replacing it with something far better for American families. I want to continue to highlight one of the many stories I am hearing from my constituents. I wonder whether the Senator from New York is hearing some of these same stories from his constituents. This gentleman is a small business owner in the Fort Worth area who told me that since ObamaCare was imple-mented, this small business owner has been forced to change his insurance every year. Can you imagine going through that headache and hassle when President Obama said: If you like your health coverage, you can keep it. He was also the one who said: If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. He also promised that premiums would go down an average of $2,500 for a fam-ily of four—none of which has proved to be true. In this particular gentle-man’s case, as is the case for many Americans, his rates have gone through the roof, rising from roughly $350 a month to $800 a month. Despite the higher cost, he now receives less coverage because his out-of-pocket maximum has risen from $3,500 to $14,000. That is simply outrageous. Throughout the entire process, he has been fighting a losing battle. As is the case with many States, in-cluding Iowa, provider after provider has pulled out of my State as well, as they are unable to afford ObamaCare at all. This small business owner is not only forced to literally find new insurance every year, but he has to change pro-viders each year and has fewer options available. Along the way—this is the other promise President Obama made that has been broken—this gentleman has lost access to his doctor of 20 years. He refers to the hope he had when President Obama looked into the camera and said: Now listen to me. You can keep your insurance, and you can keep your doctor, and you will pay less. That is what President Obama said when he was selling ObamaCare. Instead, this gentleman, this small business owner from Fort Worth, did not get to keep his insurance. He lost his doctor of 20 years, and he now pays nearly three times more for less cov-erage and higher deductibles. He closed his letter to me with a question. He asked: Can I count on you? I look around the Chamber, and I ask all of us: Can the American people count on us? I know they can because it is our re-sponsibility to provide something far better than what they have had under ObamaCare. They can count on us if we work together to find solutions that actually provide the high-quality healthcare American families deserve at prices they can afford. In many in-stances, this means getting govern-ment out of the way and allowing the marketplace to lower costs and in-crease quality, which is what markets do much better than government regu-lation. Right now, every Senator on this side of the aisle is discussing with our col-leagues how best to accomplish that, and we are also discussing this with the people whom we represent—the physicians, the healthcare providers, and others—to try to determine the best way forward. I hope our Demo-cratic colleagues will join us rather than give us lectures from the Senate floor about the way we are conducting our business, particularly when their hands are unclean, to say the least, when it comes to the way they jammed ObamaCare down the throats of the American people to such bad effect. I would encourage them, rather than to just obstruct, to actually work with us in a bipartisan fashion. We would come up with a better product, a more dura-ble product, if our Democratic friends would work with us rather than just sit on their hands or actively obstruct our efforts to get the job done. I urge our colleagues from both sides to work together to find a solution that repeals what is broken in ObamaCare and replace it with patient- centered, accessible, and affordable healthcare. I hope that eventually oth-ers will come around to join us if for no other reason than their constituents are hurting from the status quo. Madam President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Wisconsin. ANNIVERSARY OF THE PULSE NIGHTCLUB MASS  
SHOOTING IN ORLANDO  
Ms. BALDWIN. Madam President, I rise to recognize the first anniversary of a horrific tragedy that shook this Nation. One year ago, in the early morning hours of June 12, 2016, we all witnessed an unthinkable act of hatred and terror at the Pulse nightclub in Or-lando, FL. It was Pride Month and Latin night, and dozens of gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender people, along with friends and family, were gathered simply to have fun in what should have been a place of acceptance, affirma-tion, and safety. In a matter of mo-ments, what should have been a cele-bration turned into one of the worst mass shootings in American history—a targeted act of terror and hate, an at-tack on the freedoms we all hold dear. These 49 innocent people lost their lives in this attack, and 53 others were wounded. Many, many others bear the emotional scars. This was not only a deadly act of do-mestic terrorism; it was a hate crime— a crime that targeted victims because of who they were and was designed not just to harm its victims but to ter-rorize everyone in the community. Last year, I came to the floor to read the names and tell the stories of the victims of this massacre in Orlando, because we cannot and we must not forget these men and women. Their stories need a voice. Today, I rise again to remember the victims. As I did 1 year ago, I come to the floor to ask my colleagues to find the courage to stand up, speak out, and act to confront the rising tide of hate crimes and discrimination in America. We must never forget the victims of this hate crime, and we must honor them with action. While the Pulse shooting was an un-imaginable horror, it is, sadly, far from the only act of violence that has been perpetrated out of hatred. Even before June 12 of last year, we had seen an alarming increase in reports of hate crimes against LGBTQ people but also against racial and religious minorities and immigrants. In the aftermath of a divisive election, we saw hundreds of documented instances of discrimina-tion, harassment, and even violence against members of minority commu-nities as well as increased hostility within our Nation’s schools. In this year alone, at least 11 transgender peo-ple have been murdered, most of them women of color. The fact is that many members of ra-cial, ethnic, disability, and religious minority communities, as well as LGBT people, live in very real fear for their safety. They are scared, and it is

incumbent upon President Trump as our Nation’s leader to demonstrate to them and to all Americans that dis-crimination and violence against any individual because of who he is, whom he loves, and how he worships will not be tolerated in this country. When I stood here last year, I called for a greater investment in the Federal Government’s effort to both try to pre-vent hate crimes and fully investigate and prosecute them whenever they happen. After President Trump took office, I was joined by a number of my Senate colleagues in urging him and the Attorney General to support robust funding for the Department of Justice’s programs that combat bias-motivated crimes. I believe a documented in-crease in hate crimes demands an in-crease in the resources that are com-mitted to fighting this problem. Yet the budget put forward by President Trump and Attorney General Sessions seeks no increases. In fact, it proposes cutting more than 100 staff from the Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division. This administration has failed to step up and speak out against this dis-turbing trend across our country or to commit the resources necessary to fight it. Instead of showing the moral leader-ship our Nation needs in the face of in-creasing hatred and division, President Trump and his administration have taken steps to roll back our Nation’s progress in many areas, including progress for the LGBT community. Rather than issue a proclamation recognizing Pride Month and commit-ting to address the many challenges still facing LGBT Americans, President Trump recently issued an Executive order that could open the door to dis-crimination with Federal taxpayer dol-lars. Rather than stand up for transgender students facing bullying, harassment, and discrimination, this administra-tion rescinded guidance to schools about the rights of those vulnerable young people under Federal law. Rather than building on the steps taken to better understand the needs of LGBT people by simply counting us, the Trump administration has walked back efforts to ask about LGBT Ameri-cans in Federal surveys at the Depart-ment of Health and Human Services and the Census Bureau. Simply put, President Trump has not lived up to his vow to be a President for all Americans. But where I come from, in Wisconsin, our State motto consists of one word: ‘‘Forward.’’ I believe that no matter who is in the Oval Office, our country must move in only one direction—for-ward. Remember, while Pride Month is, of course, about celebration—of who we are and of how far we have come—it is just as much about bravely standing up and speaking out so that others will not feel compelled to live in silence. To the survivors of the Pulse shoot-ing and the families and friends of those who were murdered and who feel the wounds of this tragedy most deep-ly, we hear your voices and we are in-spired by your strength. As a community, we have never been deterred by tragedy and will not be now. One of the early leaders in our fight for equality was Harvey Milk, and he was also struck down by violent ha-tred. Harvey Milk famously said: ‘‘Hope will never be silent.’’ So today I rise to remind us of the power of hope in the face of tragedy. We must continue to work to pass on to the next generation a country that is more equal, not less. We must re-main strong in fighting any rollback of progress, large or small. There is more work to be done to en-sure that all Americans are protected from hatred and discrimination, and the work toward full equality for LGBTQ people and their families re-mains far from complete. For myself and those who stand united this Pride Month, we are guided by our uniquely American values. It is about freedom—the freedom to realize our founding belief that all Americans are created equal under the law. It is about fairness—whether gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender Americans deserve to be treated just like their family members, their friends, their neighbors, their fellow workers. It is about opportunity—about whether every American gets to dream the same dreams, chase the same ambi-tions, and have the same shot at suc-cess. This is the promise of America, and we must fight to make sure we keep it. I yield the floor.

ANNIVERSARY OF THE PULSE NIGHTCLUB MASS  
SHOOTING IN ORLANDO  
Mr. NELSON. Madam President, I will not be addressing the matter be-fore us because I have just come from Orlando, where so many are feeling such deep, deep sorrow today. It has been 1 year since the tragic attack on the Pulse nightclub in Orlando. The horror of that early morning still remains fresh for so many, espe-cially those hundreds and hundreds of people who gathered at the Pulse nightclub this morning on the occasion of 1 year since the tragedy. There was quite a ceremony to remember the 49 innocent souls we lost. It was a mas-sacre of huge proportions by a ter-rorist. What terrorists want to do is to di-vide people. They want to terrorize them. They inject fear. Interestingly, the terrorist, whose name was Omar Mateen—although he changed the lives of so many, he took the lives of 49 peo-ple. He changed a lot of other lives of those who were wounded, and, of course, the families of the 49 victims are still suffering. Interestingly, a terrorist wants to di-vide and inject fear, but this has had the opposite effect in Orlando. It has unified people. It has unified the com-munity as I have never seen before. It has unified our State; indeed, it has unified our Nation. So quite the oppo-site effect has happened from what the terrorist intended—other than the slaughter of 49 innocent lives. Sadly, these are the 49, and they are all being honored today. It was a very moving ceremony. One of the causes that came out of the unification of Orlando is that—in-stead of creating a number of victims’ funds—they put it all into one fund. Tens of millions of dollars have now gone into that fund, and it is helping to finance some of the victims who sur-vived and their medical expenses, some of the families and the loved ones of those who were lost. Interestingly, being there, suddenly those moments came rushing back. I heard about it early on a Sunday morn-ing when the news broke about the massacre the night before, which had occurred in the early morning hours. As I raced from my home to downtown Orlando on South Orange Avenue, I was able to get on the telephone the No. 3 at the FBI, and he gave me authoriza-tion to tell what they originally were anticipating had happened. Once I got to the scene, I was able to share that. Of course, they had a representative of the FBI on the scene. They had set up a command post. Mayor Buddy Dyer had taken charge. It was quite a scene. The tales of heroism are nonstop. The Orlando Police Department SWAT team, which went inside—before they could get the SWAT team there, mem-bers of the Police Department and the Sheriff’s Department were there. One block away was a fire station that be-came a triage point. First responders got there and were trying to save peo-ple’s lives. It was because of the mas-sive number of casualties—49—that while the gunman Mateen was holed up in one of the bathrooms with hostages, some whom he had already shot had bled to death. While he was in the bathroom, police and paramedics were going in and pulling people out in those dark hours of the early morning. Of course, they were using whatever vehi-cle—if there was a pickup truck, they would put the victims on the truck. Fortunately, Orlando Regional Medical Center is only about six to eight blocks away, and, of course, it is a trauma center hospital.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES3386 June 12, 2017 
About a week later, I went to see the trauma surgeons. A resident who had been getting his residency there as a trauma surgeon was so moved by that experience that he put on his Facebook page what he was feeling and showed a picture of his bloody shoes that he didn’t even recognize because he was so busy. It was not until the next day that he looked at those shoes. He put a pic-ture of that on his Facebook page, and he wrote: To be a trauma surgeon and have waves of people coming in, I didn’t know if they were Black or White; I didn’t know if they were gay or straight. All I knew was I was doing everything I could to save lives. In some cases, they would make an initial prep; then they would get the victim, who was still living, up to the operating room where other surgeons were taking over. In some cases, they did not have time. They had to do the operation right there in the trauma center. Fortunately, the one trauma center in all of Central Florida is right there at Orlando Regional Medical Cen-ter. So a terrorist, perhaps aided and abetted by his wife—this is an open question, and that determination has not been made. A terrorist tried to di-vide us as a nation, just as they had be-fore on 9/11 and at San Bernardino and in so many other cases where they had been foiled. There are others whom you can’t label as terrorists, but they are in their own ways—all the killings that have occurred at schools. If you lump all of that together, they try to divide us. Yet Orlando came together, united. They have a catch phrase for it. It is called Orlando Strong. America is a nation of compassion, generosity, kindness, and respect. Those are precisely the qualities we saw from the people of Orlando when they came together a year ago, and this Senator saw that again in vivid de-tail this morning. We are forever grateful for the brav-ery and heroism of the police, the first responders, the sheriff’s department, the FBI, the families, and victims help-ing other victims. We are forever grateful for the trauma surgeons and the operating room nurses and doctors, as they saved lives. We are forever grateful for the hospital and how it completely accommodated all of this mass confusion and how it forgave all of the medical expenses for those who had been victims, both the living and the dead. We are forever grateful for those who rushed to the scene that night in the face of uncertainty, in the pitch darkness of that nightclub, not knowing where the shooter was. We are forever grateful for the skills of the ne-gotiators as they tried to talk the shooter down. Ultimately, when he came out with the automatic weapons blazing, they had to take him down. To all of those heroes, we say thank you. To all of those heroes who are also the families of these victims, we say thank you. To the victims’ families and loved ones, we want to say that even though you lost those loved ones, they did not die in vain. Out of evil, what we have seen is good. Thanks to all of Orlando, not only for what you did that night, but thank you for what you do every day. A year later, I can report to the Senate that we are Orlando Strong. I yield the floor.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, a year ago today, Americans—myself included— awoke to the shocking news that 49 of our fellow Americans had been killed overnight in one of the deadliest mass shootings, mass attacks in our Na-tion’s history. I recall that day. It was a Sunday morning. I was home, and we were get-ting ready to go to church, as we do. The news was on. We don’t usually turn on the TV. That day, the text messages were coming in, and it spoke about this horrifying incident that occurred over-night. The news reports were still sketchy. For whatever reason—be it because of our work here or a bad gut feeling— I remember telling my family that I was going to get in my truck and drive the 3 hours to Orlando to be there be-cause I felt there was something be-yond the scale and scope of it, a little bit different about this horrifying at-tack. As I drove north on the Florida turnpike, the updates on the radio kept coming in. The scale of it was unbeliev-able. The numbers kept climbing, and there was still not a lot of detail about what was behind it. After I arrived on the scene and was able to interact with some of our Fed-eral authorities and State authorities who were there, the picture still wasn’t abundantly clear, but the one thing that began to emerge was, this was the act of a single individual inspired by an ideology of hate and supported in the pursuit of that ideology by people who before that and since then have been responsible for attacks all over the world. I think the part that was perhaps most troubling for a lot of people is— especially for me, I found myself at that time, 45 years of age, at the half-way point between the age of the peo-ple who would have been there and the age of someone whose child might have been there, and the randomness of it— the notion that a lot of young people went out that night to have a good time with their friends. It was Latin night. This was a well-known nightclub in the LGBT community in Central Florida. I don’t think that when you get up at night and get dressed and go out that you think one of the risks in-volved is you are going to end up inter-acting with a jihadist terrorist. That is what happened that night. The other part that was so startling is, so often for so many of us, these bad things happen somewhere else. They happen in France. They happen in Lon-don. They happened on 9/11 in New York City. This happened in Florida, just down the street from a place that I had been a year earlier—a small busi-ness, furniture store whose owners I had gotten to know as I was writing a book about small businesses and the like. The familiarity of it, how close it was to home, and the idea that the war on terror had not just come to America that day but it had come to Central Florida. Ultimately, we learned it had come to impact people whom we knew through others and whose stories sounded quite familiar. We now know it was the worst attack on U.S. soil since September 11 of 2001. In this time when we are having so many debates about whom we are going to allow into our country and what criteria we are going to use and from what places they can come, it is important to stop and remember that the individual—whose name I will not even say because I think one of the hopes he had is that he would go down in history as a famous person, but this individual lived in our country for a long time. He lived among us since the day he was born. He was not someone who had come on an airplane or had re-cently arrived from another culture, another society. He was an American, born and raised in the United States. If my memory doesn’t fail me, I believe he was born in Queens, NY. What strikes me is, he benefited from everything this country offers: free-dom, liberty. He knew people. He lived among fellow Americans his whole life. He went to work every morning along-side them. He had all of the blessings and the opportunities and everything this country provides. Yet even that was not enough to somehow inspire him not just to take on this evil ide-ology but to act on it. Obviously, the attack was personal for the 49 families with stories of their own and of course the countless others who were injured. I know it was per-sonal to the LGBT community and Central Florida. As I said, Pulse was a well-known cornerstone of the commu-nity, particularly for younger people. As I said earlier, this was deeply per-sonal for Floridians and for the people of Central Florida. I will get to that in a moment because I am extraordinarily proud of that community. I think it was personal for all Americans. When I arrived, I saw these people, largely still—I don’t know what time it was, but the attacks weren’t even 12 hours old. I saw family members of people they loved or loved ones who were outside in desperate mode. You know that look on your face where, ‘‘I want to know what happened. I don’t know if the person I love is inside there. I haven’t heard from them.’’ One of the most chilling things I heard from law enforcement was that

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S3387 June 12, 2017 
the cell phones were still buzzing as people were calling their loved ones. It brought home that this wasn’t just 49 as a number. It is so easy to see that scroll across the television set. It is even easy to say it now, 49. They were 49 human beings, 49 human beings with families who loved them, parents who loved them, siblings who loved them. I saw that firsthand when I got there. I saw the look of people behind the yel-low rope who had no idea if someone whom they deeply loved and cared for lay dead on the other side of that tape. I remember not long after, crowds began to form and people started show-ing up with signs that said things like: ‘‘We’re with you.’’ ‘‘We love you.’’ This was early. I am talking about 12 to 13 hours after the attack happened. I commend the law enforcement— Federal, State, local—who came to-gether and responded. I saw people coming off duty, people who were not on duty that day, putting on the uni-form and showing up to see how they could help. We saw the long lines of ev-eryday citizens bringing food and water to support their efforts. Later that day, we saw long lines of Floridians lined up to donate blood. There is no doubt that this was a community that was heartbroken, but it was also a community that was un-broken; that I believe woke up stronger and more united than it was when I went to sleep the night before. I think, ultimately, the man who committed this attack and the people who inspired him to do so would have been horrified by what they saw. I think they would have been horrified to see First Baptist Church in Or-lando—a pillar of the Christian evan-gelical community—opening its doors to the LGBT community and wel-coming them and their families and holding services there. I think they would have been horrified by that. I think they would have been horrified by people putting aside, if but for a mo-ment, their voter registration cards, their preferences in the upcoming elec-tions, their backgrounds, the way their last names are pronounced or whom they love. They put all this aside and said: These are 49 Americans—and their families—who just died at the hands of an evil terrorist. We are com-mitted to doing everything we can to provide support for them. I think these terrorists would have been horrified to see what has happened since that time. In so many ways, Central Florida grew up—and I mean that in a positive way—so much in the last year, in terms of coming together, in the sense of community, and obviously it is sometimes in tragedy that we see that happen. I think it served as an extraor-dinary inspiration to communities all around the country who hope to achieve the same level of unity without the tragedy. While the attack may have succeeded in sowing death and heartbreak, it failed in sowing doubt about our way of life. In the year that has followed, we have seen hundreds of thousands of Americans come together in Orlando to celebrate the lives of the victims and to begin that healing process. In the weeks and months after the attack, memorials were established throughout downtown Orlando, mark-ing the loss of 49 of our brothers and sisters. We saw ceremonies held in every part of the State, from Pensacola to Miami, FL. One thing that really stands out in particular is, one of the memorials was a set of 49 white crosses that rested aside the Orlando Regional Medical Center, the trauma center where a number of the victims were taken that morning. Those crosses are now at the Orange County Regional History Cen-ter. Each one of these crosses is about 3 to 4 feet high and has the name of one of the 49 victims. People from all across the Nation visited this memo-rial, including, at the time, President Obama and Vice President Biden. They came to pay their respects and to leave a token of their mourning in the honor of those taken that night—cards and pictures, teddy bears and flowers were set around each cross, and people wrote notes and well-wishes on the crosses to honor the memory of each of the 49. When the crosses were taken by a po-lice motorcade to the history center, one mother—I have chosen not to list her name because it is not for me to do, but she was there to assist that Tues-day with moving that cross that rep-resented her daughter. She and her husband, I think, by now know this, but we share a mutual friend in the Or-lando area, and I have learned first-hand from him just how hard the loss of their daughter was for them. In the end, before I am a Senator or anything else I do, I am a husband and a father, and I have a child whose name is the same as their daughter. I, for the life of me, cannot begin to fathom what they have gone through in the past year, along with 48 other families. As they moved her cross with her name on it, they saw a note on it that had been written by someone in the community. They don’t know who it was. The note was very simple, but it was very powerful. The note said: ‘‘I never knew you but I love you.’’ It strikes me that line, ‘‘I never knew you but I love you,’’ for those of us in the Christian faith, reminds us of what Christ said is one of our greatest Com-mandments, to love your neighbor as yourself. For the past year, we have felt the deep pain. We have also seen in Orlando that it is united. ‘‘One Orlando.’’ At a time when we can always find some-thing to divide us, a community came together to honor the memory of those who were lost. Each of them was a son or a daughter, a brother, a sister, a mother, a father, a husband, a wife, or a partner. In the end, they were a part of our families and our communities. Each of them, like all of us, had im-mense promise and hope. Each in their own way were a part of what makes this country a great nation, and they were lost that terrible night 1 year ago, but they were loved. A year later, we remember them and those they left behind. I hope we will honor them by finding a way as a na-tion to remember that despite our dif-ferences on a vast number of issues, we are still one nation under God, the greatest Nation on Earth, the most ex-traordinary people who have ever lived, a nation that is not simply a people bound together by a common blood or common heritage, a common ethnicity. America is more than a country. It is an idea, the idea that every single human being has a God-given right to live life as they so choose and to fulfill their potential. I hope we will continue to work here and everywhere we can to live up to that powerful idea that changed the world. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

BUILDING AND SUSTAINING A LARGER NAVY Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, as chair-man of the Seapower Subcommittee, I rise this afternoon to direct the atten-tion of this body to an important na-tional security issue: building and sus-taining a larger Navy. President Trump wants a 350-ship Navy, which aligns with the Navy’s re-quirement for 355 ships. Right now we have only 275 ships in the battle fleet. Increasing the size of the Navy by 80 ships, even as older ships retire each year, is a test of national will. It will not happen overnight. However, Con-gress has the responsibility to lay a firm foundation this year to prepare for a deliberate and responsible buildup in the future. A healthy shipbuilding industrial base is necessary to succeed.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S3391 June 12, 2017 
Today, I will offer some general com-ments about the state of shipbuilding. Then I will focus on the submarine in-dustrial base, in particular, because of its unique challenges. Finally, I will make suggestions on how Congress can support the industrial base in general and the submarine yards specifically. Last month, my subcommittee con-vened two hearings on this matter. The first was with naval officials. This took place in a classified setting because of their expertise and because of sensitive information. The other hearing was with the country’s two top ship-builders—Huntington Ingalls and Gen-eral Dynamics—as well as the Ship-builders Council of America, which is the trade association for suppliers. We discussed the industrial base as it ex-ists today and the challenges associ-ated with building up the fleet. Based on my subcommittee’s work, here are four general impressions of the state of shipbuilding. No. 1, the yards are turning out most classes of ships on time and on budget. Ingalls Shipbuilding just delivered the newest big-deck amphibious ship—the LHA—13 weeks early. Electric Boat and Newport News continue to deliver Virginia-class attack submarines, or SSNs. Construction time for attack submarines has declined by 1
1⁄2years— from 84 months to 66 months. There are a few notable exceptions, but, by and large, industry is delivering for the warfighter and for the taxpayer. No. 2, most yards have excess capac-ity to ramp up shipbuilding. This is very good news for national security. The Navy’s accelerated fleet plan con-cluded that the industrial base can build an additional 29 ships—above pro-jections—over the next 7 years. The glaring exceptions are the submarine yards, which will struggle to meet planned demand as the new Columbia- class ballistic missile submarine pro-duction starts. In terms of capacity, our submarine yards have a ways to go. No. 3, two decades of low-rate ship-building have significantly reduced the supplier base. The Congressional Budg-et Office has stated that ships cost more today than they did during the Reagan buildup, even when adjusting for inflation. Twenty years ago, about 17,000 suppliers served the submarine business. Now only about 3,000 first- tier suppliers are left. Let me repeat this. We used to have 17,000 suppliers. Now we have 3,000. These 3,000 suppliers include large corporations, such as Northrop Grumman and L3, which have tens of thousands of employees. These 3,000 suppliers also include mom-and- pop small businesses with just a few employees. Whether they deal with large corporations or small businesses, the shipyards increasingly buy from sole-source suppliers. In fact, Newport News spends about 65 percent of its budget in buying pieces and parts from single and sole-source suppliers. Gen-eral Dynamics faces a very similar sit-uation. I have little doubt that this dramatic erosion in the supplier base explains why ships cost more today. No. 4, in terms of my general obser-vations, Congress has a critical role to play in supporting a buildup through advance procurement funding, through multiyear procurement authority, and through block buys. These tools can stimulate the supplier base, stabilize the workforce, and achieve significant savings through producing economies of scale. In addition, incremental fund-ing authority is a tool that Congress can authorize to smooth out peaks and valleys in appropriations. This makes it easier to buy more ships in 1 year without busting the budget. To sum it up, most yards are per-forming well and have the capacity to ramp up. The submarine yards are doing exceptional work but will strug-gle because of capacity. All ship-builders face a diminished supplier base, which undermines competition, and Congress can help improve the sup-plier situation and stabilize the skilled workforce through using acquisition authorities. That is a snapshot of the overall shipbuilding industrial base. Now let’s turn to submarines specifically. Let’s begin with the Navy’s requirements. In 2016, the Navy set a new require-ment. The total requirement for ships is 355. That includes an increase of 47 ships from the previous level. For the Navy’s submarine fleet, the new plan calls for 66 attack submarines and 12 ballistic missile submarines. We cur-rently have 52 attack submarines—a number that will eventually decline to 41 over the next decade unless we do something about it. I propose we do something about it. We currently have 14 ballistic missile submarines as part of our nuclear deterrent. Beginning in 2021, 12 of these will be replaced by the new Columbia-class ballistic missile submarines. To reiterate, we need 355 ships. That includes 66 attack submarines and 12 ballistic missile submarines. How does the President’s budget request match up? The fiscal year 2018 request in-cludes nine ships and prioritizes readi-ness more so than modernization. Con-gress needs to work with the President to reach his goal and to reach the re-quirement of 350 to 355 ships. I look for-ward to working with the administra-tion on these budget numbers in order to make them work and to help the President achieve his goal. Now let’s talk about submarines. The budget request fully funds R&D for Co-lumbia-class SSBNs to keep the pro-gram on track. The budget also funds the procurement of two Virginia-class submarines. We have followed this pol-icy for years. The Navy will struggle to ramp up submarine production because of the industrial base for submarines and how it will be stretched to capacity. The CBO tells us that reaching 355 ships in 15 years is not possible because we lack submarine production capacity. Elec-tric Boat and Newport News are invest-ing billions to recapitalize facilities, workforce, and suppliers, but that re-capitalization effort is aimed at meet-ing current projected demand. Arresting the decline in attack sub-marines, while maintaining the sched-ule for the Columbia-class SSBN, will take a significant recapitalization ef-fort. We have done it before, and we can do it again. From the mid-1970s to the mid-1990s, industry steadily deliv-ered three attack submarines per year and added a fourth SSBN on time and on budget. There is no reason we can-not do this again. We must take deci-sive action now to make this a reality. There are four ways in which Congress can help. No. 1, repeal the defense budget caps. Sufficient and stable funding is the starting point for expanding submarine and shipbuilding capacity. The Budget Control Act-mandated budget caps have damaged military readiness and choked off modernization. While in-tended as a way to incentivize us to re-form mandatory programs, the BCA de-fense caps have proved to be a self-in-flicted wound. We cannot solve our spending and debt problem on the backs of our warfighters and industrial base, much less on the backs of the se-curity of Americans. Congress needs to end the defense budget caps imme-diately. No. 2, we need to accelerate and fully fund advance procurement. This will help stimulate and encourage new en-trants into the supplier base. We need more competition. We need more sup-pliers. Driving down the cost per ship will free up resources to buy more ships. No. 3, we need to incentivize capital investment. Congress should work with industry to identify responsible and cost-effective ways to incentivize in-vestments in facilities and capital equipment. No. 4, we need to target some appro-priations to fund process improve-ments. I mentioned earlier that New-port News and Electric Boat have shaved a year and a half off Virginia production through more efficient manufacturing. We need more of this sort of thing. Shipbuilding is a team effort, and these are four ways in which Congress can help to constructively participate in this national project. The requirement for a bigger Navy is clear. The Navy needs our help to ful-fill its mission. Numbers matter when it comes to projecting naval power in this day and age. The President and the Navy agree that we must build a bigger Navy. To summarize, the shipbuilding in-dustrial base is up to the task. Sub-marine production will be the most challenging part of this. There is lim-ited capacity for submarine yards, and we need to do something about that, but Congress can take a number of steps now. We must start to build a foundation this year. I am committed— and I hope the entire Congress is com-mitted—to setting this firm founda-tion, and I certainly intend to use my

CLIMATE DISRUPTION Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, cli-mate disruption is a significant con-cern for the health of our planet. It is affecting everything from our agri-culture to our economy, to our forests, to our world’s glaciers, to our ice sheets, and, certainly, to the distribu-tion of the world’s insects and the dis-eases they carry. President Trump’s decision to with-draw from the Paris Agreement has at-tracted additional attention to the role that America should play in taking on this major challenge. How significant are the impacts of climate disruption to our forests and our farming and our fishing? What are the business opportu-nities of transforming an economy from that based on fossil fuels to that based on clean and renewable energy? What are other nations doing? How fast do we need to move to save the planet? There will be many scholarly speech-es on these topics here on the floor— many who will have been informed by the experiences that Senators will have had in their home States, both in the evolution of wind and solar energy and the changes that they are seeing in their forests and their farming and their fishing. I hope to draw attention and, hopefully, insights as to these issues in a more lighthearted fashion by presenting periodic episodes of a Senate Climate Disruption Quiz. Today, I am presenting episode No. 1 of this Disruption Quiz series. Let’s get started. Question No. 1: Which famous CEO resigned from three Presidential coun-cils after President Trump announced that the United States would withdraw from the Paris Agreement? Was it Bob Iger of Disney? Was it Elon Musk of Tesla and SpaceX? Was it Travis Kalanick, the CEO of Uber? Consider which of these individuals made this decision. The right answer is Elon Musk. Con-gratulations if that is what you guessed. Bob Iger of Disney resigned from a Presidential council, but he resigned only from one, not three. He resigned from the Presidential Strategic and Policy Forum, and he has been quite significant in putting forward other en-vironmental issues, such as the zero waste of Disney’s theme parks. He said when he resigned: 
Protecting our planet and driving eco-nomic growth are critical to our future, and they aren’t mutually exclusive. 
He continued: 
I deeply disagree with the decision to with-draw from the Paris Agreement. 
Travis Kalanick, the controversial and besieged Uber CEO, also resigned from the same council, that being the Presidential Strategic and Policy Forum, but he did so in response to the President’s Muslim ban, not to the an-nouncement that the United States would withdraw from the Paris Agree-ment. That takes us to Elon Musk, who re-signed from three councils—the Presi-dent’s Strategic and Policy Forum, Manufacturing Initiative, and Execu-tive Council on Infrastructure. He tweeted: Am departing Presidential councils. Cli-mate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or for the world. 
So that is the first question. Now get ready to see if you can answer the sec-ond question correctly. Question No. 2: As of today, which two countries are not party to the Paris Agreement? Is it Syria and Nica-ragua? Is it Iran and North Korea, two members of the axis of evil? Is it Togo and Indonesia, or is it India and Cam-bodia? I am sure you have heard cli-mate news about all of these countries, but you may not know which ones are the only two countries in the world that are not members of the Paris Agreement. By the way, the United States is not on this list because even though we have announced we are withdrawing, that takes some time, and we are actu-ally still a member. The correct answer is Syria and Nica-ragua. Nicaragua hasn’t signed on because they don’t believe the Paris Agreement goes far enough in its fight against cli-mate disruption. Today, more than half of Nicaragua’s electricity comes from renewable resources—wind, solar, wave, and geothermal. The Govern-ment of Nicaragua predicts that within a few years, the percentage of elec-tricity from renewables will rise to 80 percent. Because of the abundance of these resources, a 2013 World Bank re-port labeled Nicaragua ‘‘a renewable energy paradise.’’ The reason Syria didn’t participate or sign on to the Paris Agreement is because it is in the midst of a horrific 6-year-long civil war that has claimed the lives of 300,000 men, women, and children and driven millions out of the country. Now we will turn to question No. 3. Thanks in part to warmer tempera-tures and milder winters, cases of which tick-borne illness have more than doubled since 1991? Is the answer Colorado tick fever or tularemia or Lyme disease or Heartland virus? By the way, all of these are real dis-eases. Well, Colorado tick fever is a viral infection that is mostly found in the mountain areas of the Western United States and Canada and is trans-mitted by the bite of an infected Rocky Mountain wood tick. Tularemia, which is also known as rabbit fever or deer fly fever or O’Hara’s fever, is certainly a scary-sounding disease. Lyme disease is mostly transmitted by deer tick bites and is predominantly found in the Northeast and upper Midwest, the Mid- Atlantic regions of the country. And then there is the Heartland virus, which is transmitted by the lone star tick. Well, the correct answer is—drum roll—C, Lyme disease. Since 1991, the number of cases of Lyme disease in the United States has doubled. Approximately 30,000 people are diagnosed with the disease each year, but because it is very difficult to diagnosis, the Centers for Disease Con-trol thinks the real number of cases is about 10 times that, or 300,000 people per year here in the United States. The main reason for the increase we have seen in Lyme disease is warmer tem-peratures and milder winters. Cold win-ters kill ticks; warm winters don’t. That is what it boils down to. On to question No. 4. Who was re-cently quoted as saying that ‘‘the fuel of choice right now, certainly for us, is wind’’? Was it Bono, the lead singer of U2 and founder of the One Campaign, known for its activist work in Africa? Was it Gwyneth Paltrow, the award- winning actress? Was it Ben Fowke, the CEO of Xcel Energy, which owns and operates 13 coal plants around the country? Was it Pope Francis, who gave our President a copy of his encyc-lical when the President visited with him just a few weeks ago? Well, it turns out the answer is C, the CEO of Xcel Energy. That is a little bit surprising given that they operate more than a dozen coal plants, but it is also a company that generates one- fifth of its electricity from wind. In January, the company shut down a large natural gas plant in Colorado for 2 days, and wind, on average, provided the power for half of its customer de-mand. Wind is Xcel’s fuel of choice be-cause once the turbines are built, the cost of the fuel to operate the turbines is zero. The fuel, plainly speaking, is free. And that is what led him to this comment saying that it is a preferred choice. Anytime you can get free fuel, it beats gearing up your coal plant or your natural gas plant. Now we will turn to question No. 5, our final question. The Power Minister of which country recently announced that they intend to sell only electric cars by the year 2030? Is the answer India, which is home to 1.3 billion citi-zens, the world’s third largest oil im-porter and a country with 300 million individuals who don’t yet have access to electricity? Is it Germany, a manu-facturing powerhouse, which has had a large feed-in tariff—a subsidy, if you will—to encourage distributed solar, solar panels on the tops of commercial buildings and homes? Is it China, where the use of cars has absolutely exploded. And the pollution in Beijing is among the worst pollution in the world, driven largely by the combustion of fossil fuels. Is it Canada, which has a new Prime Minister, Prime Minister Trudeau, who has prioritized tackling climate disruption? If you guessed Germany, you are al-most right but not quite. Germany’s

Bundesrat, the country’s upper legisla-tive chamber, passed a nonbinding res-olution last October calling for a phaseout of gasoline-powered vehicles by 2030. But that is not quite the ques-tion that was asked. The question is, Which country’s Power Minister said they would only sell electric cars by the year 2030? And the answer to that is India. Speaking at this year’s annual con-ference of the Confederation of Indian Industry, Power Minister Piyush Goyal said: 
We are going to introduce electric vehicles in a very big way. We are going to make electric vehicles self-sufficient. The idea is that by 2030, not a single petrol or diesel car should be sold in the country. 
India, by the way, is already on track to be the world’s third largest solar market, with the country’s solar ca-pacity expected to reach 18.7 gigawatts by the year’s end. The country is also adding 50 percent more solar and wind generation than currently installed here in the United States. They are re-placing 770 million street and house-hold lights with energy-saving and long-lasting LEDs, and they are bring-ing access to electricity to thousands of poor rural villages through the pro-vision of solar. And they are doing all this faster than anyone could have an-ticipated. So that is the full five questions for this week’s Senate Climate Disruption Quiz. Climate disruption is the seminal challenge of our generation. We need to start taking strong, decisive action now to avoid reaching the point where the damage we are doing to our planet becomes irreversible. Thank you, Mr. President.

MORNING BUSINESS 
REMEMBERING PAMELA TODD MAY Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, today I wish to remember Pamela Todd May, a dedicated attorney, a compas-sionate servant, and a respected com-munity member. With her passing on May 14 of this year, Kentucky has lost an extraordinary woman. Pam employed her talents to serve others. As the legal counsel for Pikeville Medical Center, PMC, for over 30 years, she strived to improve the quality of life for many in her com-munity. Through her service as a trust-ee for the University of Kentucky, Pam guided an institution to prepare thou-sands of students for a lifetime of suc-cess. Her career also included service as an assistant Pike County attorney. To her loyal staff and colleagues, Pam will be remembered not only for her skills, but also for her warmth. Al-though her family and community have lost an incredible woman, I hope their memories of her love will help to ease their grief. Elaine and I join with so many in eastern Kentucky and around the Commonwealth in express-ing our heartfelt condolences to her husband, Walter, her children, Andrea and Philip, and all of her family and friends. (At the request of Mr. S
CHUMER , the following statement was ordered to be printed in the R

WILDLIFE INNOVATION AND LONGEVITY DRIVER ACT Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I want-ed to express my support for the Wild-life Innovation and Longevity Driver Act, also known as the WILD Act. I commend my Senate colleagues for passing this legislation last week. I firmly believe that we have a moral duty to be good stewards of our planet, and that includes working together to conserve species and their habitat in the United States and around the world. We face many pressing wildlife management challenges; yet we have heard in the Environment and Public Works Committee that State and Fed-eral agencies do not have adequate re-sources to face these troubling chal-lenges. That is what makes innovation and collaboration so important, and the WILD Act inspires both. The WILD Act incentivizes innovators by establishing cash-prize competitions for new technologies that prevent poaching, promote conserva-tion, manage invasive species, protect endangered species, and use nonlethal methods to control wildlife. It directs Federal agencies to manage invasive species on public lands and reauthor-izes effective government conservation programs, including those that protect some of our most loved species—ele-phants, great apes, tigers, rhinos, and marine turtles. The WILD Act also reauthorizes the Department of Interior’s Partnership for Fish and Wildlife Program, which leverages Federal funding by working with hard-working private landowners to restore and improve fish and wildlife habitats on their land. Wildlife conservation is not a par-tisan issue, which is why I was so pleased to join with Chairman B
AR-
RASSO and our colleagues on both sides of the aisle in support of this legisla-tion. The WILD Act has also been endorsed by a diverse group of stakeholders, in-cluding the World Wildlife Fund, Na-tional Wildlife Federation, Ducks Un-limited, and the Family Farm Alli-ance. I want to thank these organiza-tions for their commitment to this issue and their interest in helping our challenged fisheries and threatened ecosystems, as well as internationally treasured rhinos and elephants. I urge the House to pass the WILD Act and the President to sign it into law. Thank you.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
REMEMBERING WILLIAM G. SESLER ∑Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life of William G. Sesler, Esq., 89, who passed away peacefully on May 22, 2017. Bill’s excep-tional service to our country in the U.S. Air Force, his dedication as a pub-lic servant in Pennsylvania, and his unwavering commitment to under-served communities throughout his ca-reer are worthy of recognition. His con-tributions to the Commonwealth will never be forgotten. I ask that the obituary from Gregory P. Sesler from May 26 be printed in the RECORD . The material follows: 
Thank you to the hospital care takers, physicians, pastors, friends, relatives, church community and family. I was on my way home from the hospital last week after having just left my father and after the decision had been made by the family to put him on palliative care. It was hard, my mother was awesome. A wave of sadness swept over me as I began to think of all of the things I would soon not be able to with him again in this world. But then I thought of all the things we had been able to do together and what a blessed life he had lived. Maybe we wouldn’t climb Mount Wash-ington together again, but we did it once. No longer would we sail the Chesapeake, go ice-boating, travel on the German autobahn, see the Reformation Wall in Geneva, go to Afri-ca to Ngorongoro crater, or go transatlantic on the QE II, but we had had a chance to do them all before. We had travelled thousands of miles and done dozens of business deals to-gether, eaten lunch together at the Maenerchor Club hundreds of times. No he wouldn’t drive my Jaguar way too fast again, or sail our Catalina sailboat or visit Civil War Battle Fields or see the wild horses of the Outerbanks, or see the Northern Lights in Alberta or the great cathedrals of Europe, or return to Kenyon College for an-other reunion or read his letters to the Edi-tor. But we had been able to do all of those things together. We got the chance to shoot pheasants in South Dakota, geese in North Dakota, go to Mexico with his grandchildren, see the cliffs of Western Ireland, listen to Pavarotti at the Warner, smoke cigars on the back porch, banter about an article in the New York times, argue about business decisions, drink too much wine on a fishing trip in Canada, and enjoy over 50 Christmas parties to-gether. Although I will never again have to endure his criticism or crave his praise or chase a bear out of our campsite within the Smokey Mountains, I have been able to do all of those things with him. Although he won’t be bursting into my of-fice on December 23rd and having me accom-pany him to buy an apartment’s worth of furniture for a refugee family, or feeling the pride of seeing my aged parents volunteer in the homeless shelter, I did get to do that with him once. There may be no more deer hunting or trout fishing trips to Potter County or camp-ing on the Outer Banks, or horseback riding in the Allegheny Forests, or watching World War II documentaries or going to James Bond movies on my birthday, but not every-body gets the chance to create this wealth of memories and for that chance I have been very blessed. But while Dad loved to travel and do and experience life in a very full way, and to share those experiences with his children and grandchildren generously, it was his transfer of character, drive, and confidence to us that was his greatest gift. He also instilled in us an innate curiosity of the world. We both thank him and curse him for our restless dis-cursive minds. My mother once said that one of the reasons she married my dad 59 years ago was because she knew her life would never be boring. She was right. My dad was a non-politically correct lib-eral. He cared for people and believed in gov-ernment as an agent of good, but he wasn’t shy about criticizing the slothful or undisci-plined. He wasn’t afraid to refer to sloppy or vague thinking as BS. He admired the great planners who got things done. General George Marshal was one of those. He was not an admirer of Donald Trump. After William had been in the ICU for four days and we were able to wean him from the ventilator, he asked for his New York Times. His first comment when opening the paper was ‘‘He fired Comey? What the hell!’’ I had a special relationship with my dad. After returning to Erie from law school in 1984 we worked together for 33 years. Logged thousands of miles together, built 15 office buildings together, had many triumphs and losses, made money and lost money. We had fights, we had love, and I wouldn’t trade any of it. Thanks Dad. Thanks for helping with my kid’s college tuition, thanks for helping me buy a house, thanks for teaching me about the law and making me a better law-yer. Thank you for making me a more care-ful thinker, thank you for being my business partner, for being the family patriarch and also a great dad. He was a man who was confident, direct, capable, and precise, who valued careful thinking, reasoning and planning, he could be a tough dad and a demanding boss, and even though he was often a critic you didn’t want to hear, you often knew in the back of your mind that the criticism was justified. You were also a patriarch who greatly loved and cared for your family and were so generous to all of us, monetarily, intellectu-ally, spiritually, and emotionally—you gave us so much. You made our lives and the lives of many people who we will never know so much better with this love, your public serv-ice and the resolve to get things done. And so, we thank the Lord this day for the life of this man, my dad, and ask God to hold him in the palm of his hand, to keep him safe, to care for him, to love him and to wel-come him into eternal life. ∑ f 
TRIBUTE TO HOOSIER STUDENTS ∑Mr. YOUNG. Mr. President, in my home State of Indiana, we take great pride when our children display exem-plary academic work and interest in our Nation’s history. We are very proud of four Hoosier middle school students from Warsaw, IN, who are using their research skills to tell the story of a he-roic veteran for their National History Day project entitled ‘‘Taking a Stand at Pearl Harbor.’’ I am pleased to recognize these four fine young men, Keller Bailey and Jason Benyousky of Washington STEM Academy, Geoffrey Hochstetler, who is educated at home, and Ryun Hoffert of Eisenhower Elementary; who worked together to research, write, and per-form a series of skits around the theme, ‘‘Making a Stand in History.’’ These boys chose to design their project around the events of December 7, 1941, the day the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. As part of their detailed research, the students read a book by a veteran and Pearl Harbor survivor Donald Stratton. This book inspired

one of the scenes of their presentation, which depicts the heroic actions of Boatswain’s Mate 2nd Class Joe George’s rescue of six men from the sinking USS Arizona. Ryun Hoffert went the literal extra mile and trav-eled to Pearl Harbor for the 75th anni-versary of the attack to meet with local experts and see the memorials erected in honor of our fallen heroes. After this exhaustive research effort, these dedicated students each wrote scenes for their presentation. According to their project sponsor, Richard Rooker, each student brought his unique gifts to the team: ‘‘Keller displayed indefatigable energy. Jason contributed his outstanding acting ability. Geoffrey lent the team his calm and steady demeanor, and Ryun brought his insatiable curiosity about history to the project.’’ In February, their presentation won first place in the district competition. They continued to revise, refine, and practice their presentation, and their perseverance paid off on May 6, when they placed first in the junior division in the Indiana State competition. This week, they will compete at the na-tional competition at the University of Maryland. I would like to extend my sincerest congratulations to Keller, Jason, Geof-frey, and Ryun for their hard work, pa-triotism, and success in the Indiana State competition for National History Day. I would also like to recognize the supportive parents, teachers, and ad-visers who helped the students along the way, especially Mr. Rooker. On be-half of all Hoosiers, we are proud of your creativity and determination; your entire State is cheering for you. ∑

Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the R
ECORD . There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the R
ECORD , as follows: 
S. 1338 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-resentatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Dust Off Crews of the Vietnam War Congressional Gold Medal Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
The Congress finds that— (1) a United States Army Dust Off crew-man (pilot, crew chief, and medic) is a heli-copter crew member who served honorably in the Vietnam War aboard a helicopter air am-bulance under the radio call sign ‘‘Dust Off’’; (2) Dust Off crews performed aeromedical evacuation for United States, Vietnamese, and allied forces inside South Vietnam from May 1962 through March 1973. (3) nearing the end of World War II, the United States Army began using helicopters for medical evacuation and years later, dur-ing the Korean War, these helicopter air am-bulances were responsible for transporting 17,700 United States casualties; (4) during the Vietnam War, with the use of helicopter air ambulances, United States Army Dust Off crews pioneered the concept of dedicated and rapid medical evacuation and rescued almost 900,000 United States, South Vietnamese, and other allied sick and wounded, as well as wounded enemy forces; (5) helicopters proved to be a revolutionary tool to assist those injured on the battle-field; (6) highly skilled and intrepid, Dust Off crews were able to operate the helicopters and land them on almost any terrain in near-ly any weather to pick up wounded, after which the Dust Off crews could provide care to these patients while transporting them to ready medical facilities; (7) the vital work of the Dust Off crews re-quired consistent combat exposure and often proved to be the difference between life and death for wounded personnel; (8) the revolutionary concept of a dedi-cated combat life-saving system was cul-tivated and refined by United States Army Dust Off crews during 11 years of intense conflict in and above the jungles of South Vietnam; (9) innovative and resourceful Dust Off crews in Vietnam were responsible for taking the new concept of helicopter medical evacu-ation, born just a few years earlier, and revo-lutionizing it to meet and surpass the pre-viously unattainable goal of delivering a bat-tlefield casualty to an operating table within the vaunted ‘‘golden hour’’; (10) some Dust Off units in Vietnam oper-ated so efficiently that they were able to de-liver a patient to a waiting medical facility on an average of 33 minutes from the receipt of the mission, which saved the lives of countless personnel in Vietnam, and this leg-acy continues for modern-day Dust Off crews;

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES3398 June 12, 2017 
(11) the inherent danger of being a member of a Dust Off crew in Vietnam meant that there was a 1 in 3 chance of being wounded or killed; (12) many battles during the Vietnam War raged at night, and members of the Dust Off crews often found themselves searching for a landing zone in complete darkness, in bad weather, over mountainous terrain, and all while being the target of intense enemy fire as they attempted to rescue the wounded, which caused Dust Off crews to suffer a rate of aircraft loss that was more than 3 times that of all other types of combat helicopter missions in Vietnam; (13) the 54th Medical Detachment typified the constant heroism displayed by Dust Off crews in Vietnam, over the span of a 10- month tour, with only 3 flyable helicopters and 40 soldiers in the unit, evacuating 21,435 patients in 8,644 missions while being air-borne for 4,832 hours; (14) collectively, the members of the 54th Medical Detachment earned 78 awards for valor, including 1 Medal of Honor, 1 Distin-guished Service Cross, 14 Silver Star Medals, 26 Distinguished Flying Crosses, 2 Bronze Star Medals for valor, 4 Air Medals for valor, 4 Soldier’s Medals, and 26 Purple Heart Med-als; (15) the 54th Medical Detachment displayed heroism on a daily basis and set the standard for all Dust Off crews in Vietnam; (16) 5 members of the 54th Medical Detach-ment are in the Dust Off Hall of Fame, 3 are in the Army Aviation Hall of Fame, and 1 is the only United States Army aviator in the National Aviation Hall of Fame; (17) Dust Off crew members are among the most highly decorated soldiers in American military history; (18) in early 1964, Major Charles L. Kelly was the Commanding Officer of the 57th Med-ical Detachment (Helicopter Ambulance), Provisional, in Soc Trang, South Vietnam; (19) Major Kelly helped to forge the Dust Off call-sign into history as one of the most welcomed phrases to be heard over the radio by wounded soldiers in perilous and dire situ-ations; (20) in 1964, Major Kelly was killed in ac-tion as he gallantly maneuvered his aircraft to save a wounded American soldier and sev-eral Vietnamese soldiers and boldly replied, after being warned to stay away from the landing zone due to the ferocity of enemy fire, ‘‘When I have your wounded.’’; (21) General William Westmoreland, Com-mander, Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (1964–1968), singled out Major Kelly as an example of ‘‘the greatness of the human spirit’’ and highlighted his famous reply as an inspiration to all in combat; (22) General Creighton Abrams, Westmore-land’s successor (1968–1972), and former Chief of Staff of the United States Army, high-lighted the heroism of Dust Off crews, ‘‘A special word about the Dust Offs . . . Courage above and beyond the call of duty was sort of routine to them. It was a daily thing, part of the way they lived. That’s the great part, and it meant so much to every last man who served there. Whether he ever got hurt or not, he knew Dust Off was there.’’; (23) Dust Off crews possessed unique skills and traits that made them highly successful in aeromedical evacuation in Vietnam, in-cluding indomitable courage, extraordinary aviation skill and sound judgment under fire, high-level medical expertise, and an un-equaled dedication to the preservation of human life; (24) members of the United States Armed Forces on the ground in Vietnam had their confidence and battlefield prowess reinforced knowing that there were heroic Dust Off crews just a few minutes from the fight, which was instrumental to their well-being, willingness to fight, and morale; (25) military families in the United States knew that their loved ones would receive the quickest and best possible care in the event of a war-time injury, thanks to the Dust Off crews; (26) the willingness of Dust Off crews to also risk their lives to save helpless civilians left an immeasurably positive impression on the people of Vietnam and exemplified the finest American ideals of compassion and hu-manity; and (27) Dust Off crews from the Vietnam War hailed from every State in the United States and represented numerous ethnic, religious, and cultural backgrounds.

(a) P RESENTATION AUTHORIZED .—The Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate shall make appropriate arrangements for the presentation, on behalf of Congress, of a sin-gle gold medal of appropriate design in honor of the Dust Off crews of the Vietnam War, collectively, in recognition of their heroic military service, which saved countless lives and contributed directly to the defense of our country.

This title may be cited as the ‘‘Countering Russian Influence in Europe and Eurasia Act of 2017’’. Subtitle A—Sanctions and Other Measures With Respect to the Russian Federation 
SEC. 211. FINDINGS. 
Congress makes the following findings: (1) On March 6, 2014, President Barack Obama issued Executive Order 13660 (79 Fed. Reg. 13493; relating to blocking property of certain persons contributing to the situation in Ukraine), which authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to impose sanctions on those determined to be undermining demo-cratic processes and institutions in Ukraine or threatening the peace, security, stability, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of Ukraine. President Obama subsequently issued Executive Order 13661 (79 Fed. Reg. 15535; relating to blocking property of addi-tional persons contributing to the situation in Ukraine) and Executive Order 13662 (79 Fed. Reg. 16169; relating to blocking property of additional persons contributing to the sit-uation in Ukraine) to expand sanctions on certain persons contributing to the situation in Ukraine. (2) On December 18, 2014, the Ukraine Free-dom Support Act of 2014 was enacted (Public Law 113–272; 22 U.S.C. 8921 et seq.), which in-cludes provisions directing the President to impose sanctions on foreign persons that the President determines to be entities owned or controlled by the Government of the Russian Federation or nationals of the Russian Fed-eration that manufacture, sell, transfer, or otherwise provide certain defense articles into Syria. (3) On April 1, 2015, President Obama issued Executive Order 13694 (80 Fed. Reg. 18077; re-lating to blocking the property of certain persons engaging in significant malicious cyber-enabled activities), which authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury, in consulta-tion with the Attorney General and the Sec-retary of State, to impose sanctions on per-sons determined to be engaged in malicious cyber-hacking. (4) On July 26, 2016, President Obama ap-proved a Presidential Policy Directive on United States Cyber Incident Coordination, which states, ‘‘certain cyber incidents that have significant impacts on an entity, our national security, or the broader economy require a unique approach to response ef-forts’’. (5) On December 29, 2016, President Obama issued an annex to Executive Order 13694, which authorized sanctions on the following entities and individuals: (A) The Main Intelligence Directorate (also known as Glavnoe Razvedyvatel’noe Upravlenie or the GRU) in Moscow, Russian Federation. (B) The Federal Security Service (also known as Federalnaya Sluzhba Bezopasnosti or the FSB) in Moscow, Russian Federation. (C) The Special Technology Center (also known as STLC, Ltd. Special Technology Center St. Petersburg) in St. Petersburg, Russian Federation. (D) Zorsecurity (also known as Esage Lab) in Moscow, Russian Federation. (E) The autonomous noncommercial orga-nization known as the Professional Associa-tion of Designers of Data Processing Sys-tems (also known as ANO PO KSI) in Mos-cow, Russian Federation. (F) Igor Valentinovich Korobov. (G) Sergey Aleksandrovich Gizunov. (H) Igor Olegovich Kostyukov. (I) Vladimir Stepanovich Alexseyev. (6) On January 6, 2017, an assessment of the United States intelligence community enti-tled, ‘‘Assessing Russian Activities and In-tentions in Recent U.S. Elections’’ stated, ‘‘Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the United States presidential election.’’ The as-sessment warns that ‘‘Moscow will apply les-sons learned from its Putin-ordered cam-paign aimed at the U.S. Presidential election to future influence efforts worldwide, includ-ing against U.S. allies and their election processes’’. 
SEC. 212. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

Subtitle B—Countering Russian Influence in Europe and Eurasia 
SEC. 251. FINDINGS. 
Congress makes the following findings: (1) The Government of the Russian Federa-tion has sought to exert influence through-out Europe and Eurasia, including in the former states of the Soviet Union, by pro-viding resources to political parties, think tanks, and civil society groups that sow dis-trust in democratic institutions and actors, promote xenophobic and illiberal views, and otherwise undermine European unity. The Government of the Russian Federation has also engaged in well-documented corruption practices as a means toward undermining and buying influence in European and Eur-asian countries. (2) The Government of the Russian Federa-tion has largely eliminated a once-vibrant Russian-language independent media sector and severely curtails free and independent media within the borders of the Russian Fed-eration. Russian-language media organiza-tions that are funded and controlled by the Government of the Russian Federation and disseminate information within and outside of the Russian Federation routinely traffic in anti-Western disinformation, while few independent, fact-based media sources pro-vide objective reporting for Russian-speak-ing audiences inside or outside of the Rus-sian Federation. (3) The Government of the Russian Federa-tion continues to violate its commitments under the Memorandum on Security Assur-ances in connection with Ukraine’s Acces-sion to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, done at Budapest De-cember 5, 1994, and the Conference on Secu-rity and Co-operation in Europe Final Act, concluded at Helsinki August 1, 1975 (com-monly referred to as the ‘‘Helsinki Final Act’’), which laid the ground-work for the es-tablishment of the Organization for Security

and Co-operation in Europe, of which the Russian Federation is a member, by its ille-gal annexation of Crimea in 2014, its illegal occupation of South Ossetia and Abkhazia in Georgia in 2008, and its ongoing destabilizing activities in eastern Ukraine. (4) The Government of the Russian Federa-tion continues to ignore the terms of the Au-gust 2008 ceasefire agreement relating to Georgia, which requires the withdrawal of Russian Federation troops, free access by hu-manitarian groups to the regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, and monitoring of the conflict areas by the European Union Moni-toring Mission. (5) The Government of the Russian Federa-tion is failing to comply with the terms of the Minsk Agreement to address the ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine, signed in Minsk, Belarus, on February 11, 2015, by the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, France, and Germany, as well as the Minsk Protocol, which was agreed to on September 5, 2014. (6) The Government of the Russian Federa-tion is— (A) in violation of the Treaty between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the Elimi-nation of their Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles, signed at Wash-ington December 8, 1987, and entered into force June 1, 1988 (commonly known as the ‘‘INF Treaty’’); and (B) failing to meet its obligations under the Treaty on Open Skies, done at Helsinki March 24, 1992, and entered into force Janu-ary 1, 2002 (commonly known as the ‘‘Open Skies Treaty’’). 
SEC. 252. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
It is the sense of Congress that— (1) the Government of the Russian Federa-tion bears responsibility for the continuing violence in Eastern Ukraine, including the death on April 24, 2017, of Joseph Stone, a citizen of the United States working as a monitor for the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe; (2) the President should call on the Gov-ernment of the Russian Federation— (A) to withdraw all of its forces from the territories of Georgia, Ukraine, and Moldova; (B) to return control of the borders of those territories to their respective govern-ments; and (C) to cease all efforts to undermine the popularly elected governments of those countries; (3) the Government of the Russian Federa-tion has applied, and continues to apply, to the countries and peoples of Georgia and Ukraine, traditional uses of force, intel-ligence operations, and influence campaigns, which represent clear and present threats to the countries of Europe and Eurasia; (4) in response, the countries of Europe and Eurasia should redouble efforts to build re-silience within their institutions, political systems, and civil societies; (5) the United States supports the institu-tions that the Government of the Russian Federation seeks to undermine, including the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the European Union; (6) a strong North Atlantic Treaty Organi-zation is critical to maintaining peace and security in Europe and Eurasia; (7) the United States should continue to work with the European Union as a partner against aggression by the Government of the Russian Federation, coordinating aid pro-grams, development assistance, and other counter-Russian efforts; (8) the United States should encourage the establishment of a commission for media freedom within the Council of Europe, mod-eled on the Venice Commission regarding rule of law issues, that would be chartered to provide governments with expert rec-ommendations on maintaining legal and reg-ulatory regimes supportive of free and inde-pendent media and an informed citizenry able to distinguish between fact-based re-porting, opinion, and disinformation; (9) in addition to working to strengthen the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the European Union, the United States should work with the individual countries of Europe and Eurasia— (A) to identify vulnerabilities to aggres-sion, disinformation, corruption, and so- called hybrid warfare by the Government of the Russian Federation; (B) to establish strategic and technical plans for addressing those vulnerabilities; (C) to ensure that the financial systems of those countries are not being used to shield illicit financial activity by officials of the Government of the Russian Federation or in-dividuals in President Vladimir Putin’s inner circle who have been enriched through cor-ruption; (D) to investigate and prosecute cases of corruption by Russian actors; and (E) to work toward full compliance with the Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions (commonly referred to as the ‘‘Anti-Bribery Convention’’) of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development; and (10) the President of the United States should use the authority of the President to impose sanctions under— (A) the Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Ac-countability Act of 2012 (title IV of Public Law 112–208; 22 U.S.C. 5811 note); and (B) the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act (subtitle F of title XII of Public Law 114–328; 22 U.S.C. 2656 note). 
SEC. 253. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
The United States, consistent with the principle of ex injuria jus non oritur, sup-ports the policy known as the ‘‘Stimson Doc-trine’’ and thus does not recognize terri-torial changes effected by force, including the illegal invasions and occupations of Abkhazia, South Ossetia, Crimea, Eastern Ukraine, and Transnistria.

DAVID JOHNSON 
HON. LYNN JENKINS 
OF KANSAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, June 12, 2017 Ms. JENKINS of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate David Johnson of Lawrence, Kansas, for his commit-ment, leadership, and service to the State of Kansas and people struggling with mental ill-nesses everywhere. As his tenure as CEO of the Bert-Nash Community Mental Health Center nears its end, and we reflect on his sixteen years serv-ing as CEO, we celebrate the work he has done to positively impact the Lawrence com-munity, Douglas County, the State of Kansas, and beyond. David demonstrated national leadership as the CEO of a community mental health center by continuing to serve the ever-growing com-munity of Lawrence, while facing the challenge of decreased funding. David has championed initiatives for mental health care such as the Mental Health First Aid grant program and was the person who first brought that pro-gram’s need and impact to my attention. David has been such an effective national voice for this program that he was invited as a Con-gressional witness in 2014 to share with Mem-bers of Congress the need for the Mental Health First Act of 2013. As one of the original fourteen people trained as Mental Health First Aid instructors in the country, David undoubtedly encouraged and inspired more people to get that training so they could help their family, friends and neighbors in their time of need. David is willing to boldly lead on the issue of mental health care and advocate for the millions of Americans hiding in the shadows struggling with mental illness. When it comes to our home State of Kan-sas, David has made his imprint through un-dertaking statewide efforts that help create new opportunities for people with mental ill-ness and their families. These initiatives allow more people to discover and receive the care they need while their families are educated on ways to help their loved ones. I extend my deepest appreciation to David Johnson for his service and commitment to the State of Kansas and while I am sad to hear of his retirement, I wish him and his fam-ily all the best in the years ahead.

HONORING LGBTQ LEADERS IN THE TWIN CITIES 
HON. KEITH ELLISON 
OF MINNESOTA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, June 12, 2017 Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the transgender, queer, lesbian, bisex-ual, and gay members of my community as we begin celebrating Pride. Every year, Twin Cities Pride recognizes individuals and organi-zations who have devoted their lives to equal-ity. This year, the Grand Marshal is Jana Shortal, and the Community Champions of Pride are Clare Housing and the Avenues for Homeless Youth GLBT Host Homes Program. Jana Shortal is a journalist, public figure, and co-anchor of KARE 11’s Breaking the News, one of the Twin Cities’ most popular evening news programs. Jana has garnered a lot of attention across our city—accolades for her coverage of a mom dying of cancer, criti-cism in the Star Tribune for wearing skinny jeans, and national awards for telling stories about race, ethnicity, sexual orientation and gender identity. Throughout her career, Jana has been guided by an overarching goal: tell-ing the story. Like she’s said herself, ‘‘The av-erage person’s completely-not-average story motivates me.’’ Often times we get lost in sta-tistics or politics and forget to talk about how it’s actually impacting people’s lives. Jana’s drive to humanize the news is more important now than ever—we can’t let elected officials control the narrative just because they dislike the facts. I thank Jana for her service to our community, for her realness on screen, and for her devotion to telling the story. Clare Housing and Avenues for Homeless Youth provide something that can mean the difference between life and death for LGBTQ folks: a place to live. For 30 years, Clare Housing has provided housing for hundreds of people with HIV or AIDS. They manage mul-tiple apartment buildings for people who are independent, as well as nearly a dozen family homes where people can eat regular meals and have a caseworker assist them with doc-tor’s visits and medicine. We have made tre-mendous progress on HIV treatment, and it is unacceptable that a lack of access to housing or healthcare means it can still be a death sentence. Thanks to Clare Housing’s leader-ship, HIV positive individuals can get the housing stability they need to keep their bod-ies healthy. Avenues for Homeless Youth’s GLBT Host Home Program is a national model for com-munity and volunteer-driven efforts to end LGBTQ youth homelessness. Nearly 40 per-cent of homeless youth identify as LGBTQ, and many of them were pushed out of their homes due to their gender or sexuality. This program provides not only a roof over their head, but an environment where their identi-ties are validated and supported. Over their 15 year history, the GLBT Host Home Program has helped hundreds of kids grow into happy and healthy adults. No one should be forced into a life of economic struggles simply be-cause their parents are closed minded. The Host Home Program is a tremendous example of what ‘‘It takes a village’’ looks like in prac-tice. If the last five months have taught us any-thing, it’s that we still have so much work to do. We can’t sit back and watch our federal government walk back protections for trans kids, or school districts lead the charge to be-little and exclude them. We can’t accept the talk that we have to wait because there are more important or less divisive issues. LGBTQ equality is deeply connected to economic in-equality, racism, sexism, and every other -ism we’re fighting against. We must fight for both social and economic equality, because if we don’t fight for both, we won’t get either. My deepest thanks to these leaders in our com-munity who are showing how we advance eq-uity on all fronts. f 
RECOGNIZING OSCAR AMEZCUA 
HON. DUNCAN HUNTER 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, June 12, 2017 Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mariachi Legend Oscar Amezcua who, from his humble beginnings in Jalisco, Mexico, immigrated to San Diego in 1945 and quickly became an icon in Hispanic culture. Oscar’s skills earned him a spot on the re-nowned Mariachi Vargas de Tecalitla ´n, which was just the start of his distinguished career. Oscar would go on to establish his own group, Mariachi Guadalajara, all while raising his three sons Carlos, Oscar, Alex, and his daughter Lucia with his wonderful wife Gloria. Oscar Amezcua has dedicated his life to creating and providing us with music that has made significant contributions to San Diego’s music and culture and is credited by many with bringing Mariachi music to San Diego. Recently, at the age of 87, Oscar celebrated this past Cinco de Mayo celebration by per-forming at a special concert in San Diego’s fa-mous Balboa Park and was recognized by San Diego Mayor Kevin Falconer, who de-clared May 5, 2017, as ‘‘Oscar Amezcua Day—The Father of San Diego Mariachi Music.’’ I ask my fellow colleagues to join me in rec-ognizing Oscar’s contributions to San Diego’s music and Hispanic culture and I look forward to his continued involvement for years to come.

HON. KEN BUCK

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, June 12, 2017 Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to rec-ognize Jordan Coffman, an Air Force Acad-emy Appointee from Colorado’s Fourth Con-gressional district I believe our greatest assets are America’s brave men and women in uni-form. Jordan is making an incredible sacrifice for our country and deserves our utmost sup-port for her service. It is with great pleasure that I give her my endorsement to attend this prestigious institution. Jordan has served in a variety of leadership roles from Co-President of the National Honor Society to Senator-at-Large of the Student Government Association at her school. In ad-dition to her service roles, Jordan has excelled in athletics, receiving the Hoehne Female Ath-lete award and placing first in several Track and Field races. Our nation owes no greater debt of gratitude than to those who fight to protect our freedom and liberty. I commend Jordan and her family for their commitment. On behalf of the 4th Congressional District of Colorado, I extend my best wishes to Jordan. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to recognize Jor-dan Coffman as an appointee to the Air Force Academy for her commitment to protect and serve our nation.

RECOGNIZING A LETTER TO THE EDITOR: HEY, WHITE HOUSE: LEAVE D.C. ALONE 
HON. JAMIE RASKIN 
OF MARYLAND  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, June 12, 2017 Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share an excellent Letter to the Editor, urging the Trump administration to respect the polit-ical autonomy of American citizens living in Washington, D.C., written by David Jonas Bardin to the Washington Post. In ‘‘Hey, White House: Leave D.C. Alone,’’ David writes: ‘‘The May 28 editorial ‘More meddling’ said that the White House has joined Congress ‘‘in trying to block the District’s Death with Dignity law.’’ President Trump’s proposed budget would unconstitutionally forbid implementation of that law in the 2018 fiscal year, which starts Oct. 1. The Constitution established federal legislative power over a future federal district as well as future federal installations outside the District of Columbia, such as Fort Bragg, N.C., to safeguard legitimate federal govern-ment interests there. The Bill of Rights imme-diately limited those powers in order to block tyranny. ‘‘Even before statehood and even without D.C. voting rights in Congress, it is high time to recognize that Americans living in the Dis-trict count as ‘the people’ under the 10th Amendment, which says: ‘The powers not del-egated to the United States by the Constitu-tion, nor prohibited by it to the States, are re-served to the States respectively, or to the people.’ Power to allow, forbid or regulate phy-sician-assisted suicide was never delegated to the federal government. ‘‘Mr. Trump should heed President William Henry Harrison’s wise words: ‘The people of the District of Columbia are not the subjects of the people of the States, but free American citizens.’ ’’ f 
IN RECOGNITION OF DR. ARTHUR SMITH 
HON. PATRICK MEEHAN 
OF PENNSYLVANIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, June 12, 2017 Mr. MEEHAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Dr. Arthur Smith of Chester County, Pennsylvania for his 48 years of service to our community. Dr. Smith will be retiring at the end of this year after an astounding 48 years of service to the Ridley, Delaware County School District. Dr. Smith has for decades been a fixture in Ridley’s schools, serving in both teaching and administrative capacities. It’s not uncommon today for Ridley Middle School’s ‘‘Parents Night’’ to be packed with parents of current students who themselves had taken classes taught by Dr. Smith years or decades ago. Dr. Smith brought to his teaching an un-matched commitment to his students and an unwavering desire to see them succeed. But his day as an educator didn’t end with the final bell each afternoon. He then drove to West Chester University, where for years he’s taught evening classes. His typical days began before 5 a.m. and ended after he got home at 10:30 that night. Forty-eight years, 9,227 middle school stu-dents, 6,700 college students and countless hours spent helping each of them succeed— that’s Dr. Smith’s legacy. On behalf of our en-tire community, I thank him for his service and wish him the best in his retirement.

ANTI-BORDER CORRUPTION REAUTHORIZATION ACT (H.R. 2213) 
HON. BETTY McCOLLUM 
OF MINNESOTA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, June 12, 2017 Ms. M
CCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the Anti-Border Corruption Re-authorization Act (H.R. 2213). The current polygraph requirement was mandated as part of the Anti-Border Corrup-tion Act of 2010 to identify agents who could be corruptible or working with drug traffickers. This bill weakens critical polygraph require-ments for U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents. Given CBP’s scope of work with organized crime, drug cartels, and corruption, waiving the polygraph requirements would potentially expose the agency to corrupt law enforcement who would use their positions for personal gain. It is Congress’ duty to ensure that CBP is using the most stringent practices when hiring agents. Other federal agencies such as FBI, DEA, ATF, and Secret Service do not exempt polygraph requirements, why should CBP be the exception? I voted yes on the Lujan Grisham amend-ment to the Anti-Border Corruption Reauthor-ization Act. This amendment would have en-sured that safety measures were in place to safeguard national security, and protect the in-tegrity of the CBP and its officers. After the failure of this amendment, it be-came clear that I cannot support this bill.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay a special tribute to St. Mary’s Episcopal Church as the congregation celebrates its 150th Anniversary.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD —Extensions of RemarksE805 June 12, 2017 
Constructed shortly after the Civil War, St. Mary’s Episcopal Church in Ronkonkoma, New York has stood as a testament to its pa-trons’ religious fervor and tenacity. For a short time following the conclusion of the Civil War, Episcopalians in the area worshipped in a school house until the congregation eagerly decided in June of 1867 to build a church. The church was completed six short months later, and its first service was held on Christmas Eve of 1867. The property for the church, and a sizeable portion of the funds used to con-struct it, were donated by Welsh Colonel John Henry Puleston, a knight and distinguished Member of Parliament. Unfortunately, the parish fell on hard times around 1880, when the number of commu-nicants dropped significantly due to a dearth of year-round Protestants in the area. While there were talks about shuttering the church, Reverend Rodney M. Edwards believed the religiosity and love expressed by his parish-ioners was so resolute that he could not imag-ine deserting them. Accordingly, the church’s ardor attracted more communicants, and the parish began to once again thrive a decade later. Then, in 1920, benefactors joined to-gether to revive and repair the Church in the image of its founders’ intentions. The current St. Mary’s Episcopal Church, which was admitted into union with the dio-cese in 1972, was built with the essence of its predecessor, but with more space to house a growing number of patrons. Today, the rector of the parish is the experienced Reverend Beth O’Callaghan, who leads a congregation of over 200 communicants. This year, the par-ish remarkably celebrates its 150th anniver-sary, an apt representation of St. Mary’s Epis-copal Church’s unyielding zeal and devotion. Mr. Speaker, St. Mary’s Episcopal Church’s 150th Anniversary is an achievement that serves as a testament to the devotion of the congregation. Their religious zeal cannot be underscored or admired enough, and it is my distinct honor and privilege to represent the church in the First Congressional District of New York.

OF FLORIDA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, June 12, 2017 Mr. POSEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the accomplishments of Dr. Dwayne McCay who currently serves as the President of Flor-ida Institute of Technology. Dr. McCay is a re-nowned engineer and research scientist who was recently named Fellow of the National Academy of Inventors class of 2016—a highly prestigious professional distinction. Dwayne McCay grew up in the cotton fields of northeast Arkansas with a passion for lit-erature. In the late 1950’s and early 1960’s, as the world witnessed space exploration for the first time with the launch of Sputnik, Cosmo-naut Yuri Gagarin, and Astronaut Alan Shepard, Dwayne found himself looking to-ward the stars like so many youth at that time, including myself. He and his young friends founded a rocket society in 1961—WOMC (Wike, Oldham, McCay and Crowell)—and they had three successful launches of their homemade rockets with McCay acting as the propellant engineer. Dwayne went on to achieve a Ph.D. in engi-neering and mathematics from Auburn Univer-sity. He pursued a career as a research engi-neer with ARO, Inc., then as a senior research physical scientist with the Air Force Rocket Propulsion Laboratory. He went on to become a senior engineer at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center, being elevated to branch chief, and later division chief. Prior to serving as President of F.I.T., Dr. McCay served as Provost and Chief Academic Officer at the Florida Institute of Technology and became Florida Tech’s Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer (COO) in January 2011. Dr. McCay was previously at The University of Tennessee Space Institute, where he served as Alumni Distinguished Service Professor of Engineering Science and Program Chair of Engineering Science and Mechanics, and was chosen in a national search in 1993 as the chief executive officer for the campus. He and his wife, Dr. Mary Helen McCay, also an accomplished inventor and engineer, hold 15 joint U.S. patents in the area of met-allurgical engineering. Together they have au-thored approximately 200 technical publica-tions and, in 1998, achieved the national honor from the U.S. Department of Energy’s American Museum of Science and Energy for their technological achievements. I ask my colleagues to join me in recog-nizing Dr. Dwayne McCay, as well as Dr. Mary Helen McCay and the dedicated faculty at F.I.T., for their contributions to science and engineering, and for their commitment to in-spiring young minds and future scientists of our nation. f

It offers affordable entertainment to visitors across the state of Wisconsin and plays a big role in the city’s tourism industry. Bay Beach was initially established by Mitchell Nejedlo. Mr. Nejedlo purchased the land and began developing the land for a pri-vate beach resort. In 1920, the park’s owners donated the entire park and its building to the City of Green Bay with the intent that the land was used for park, playground, and entertain-ment purposes. The City of Green Bay expanded and devel-oped Bay Beach in a family-focused destina-tion with an emphasis on affordability for all. Today, it offers 22 distinct attractions, includ-ing the Zippin Pippin roller coaster. On June 10, 2017, Bay Beach will celebrate its 125th Birthday.

His leadership in business and the insurance industry served as an asset which made him an outstanding and excellent leader as the chairman of the House Finance, Ways and Means Committee. Rep-resentative Sargent is also generous with his time, energy, and resources. He dedicates himself to multiple charities throughout our state. True leadership is not as it appears but as it performs. His admirable service in mak-ing the tough decisions today will make a brighter future for millions of Tennesseans to-morrow. His insight will continue to impact our state and we look forward to his leadership in the future.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, June 12, 2017 Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to rec-ognize Shaina Smidt, an Air Force Academy Appointee from Colorado’s Fourth Congres-sional district. I believe our greatest assets are America’s brave men and women in uniform. Shaina is making an incredible sacrifice for our country and deserves our utmost support for her service. It is with great pleasure that I give her my endorsement to attend this pres-tigious institution. Shaina served as the Captain of her school’s Varsity Basketball team for most of her high school years, and also worked as a student basketball coach, demonstrating a real gift of leadership and heart for service. Addi-tionally, Shaina received a variety of academic awards and was a member of her high school’s chapter of the National Honor Soci-ety, showing her commitment to and passion for education. Our nation owes no greater debt of gratitude than to those who fight to protect our freedom and liberty. I commend Shaina and her family for their commitment. On behalf of the 4th Congressional District of Colorado, I extend my best wishes to Shaina. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to recognize Shaina Smidt as an appointee to the Air Force Academy for her commitment to protect and serve our nation. f

NORTHEAST DISTRICT ELKS LODGES 
HON. MIKE GALLAGHER

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, June 12, 2017 Mr. GALLAGHER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of the Northeast District Elks Lodges in Wisconsin’s 8th Congressional district for their strong support of patriotism in their com-munities. In 1907, the Grand Lodge of the Be-nevolent and Protective Order of Elks des-ignated Flag Day as June 14th. The Elks have paired their traditions and culture with that of our Country and made the American Flag a symbol of self-dedication to God, to Country, and to Fellowmen. I would like to call attention to their dedica-tion and passion to this nation and the flag that represents it. This year, members of Green Bay Elks Lodge 259 will be celebrating Flag Day for the 108th consecutive year. Members of Appleton Elks Lodge 337 are celebrating their chapter founding the oldest Flag Day parade since 1950. Citizens from Oconto, Kaukauna, and Marinette are also given the chance to cele-brate this important day. Oconto Elks Lodge 887, Kaukauna Elks Lodge 962, and Marinette Elks Lodge 1313 give Americans this oppor-tunity. Flag Day is a day honoring the symbolism the flag provides to all American citizens. It is my honor to report this type of patriotism dis-played by constituents in northeastern Wis-consin.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE SIERRA CLUB OF MICHIGAN FOR 50 YEARS OF SAFEGUARDING THE ENVIRONMENT 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, June 12, 2017 Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Sierra Club of Michigan on the organization’s 50th Anniversary. The Sierra Club has played a pivotal role in helping pro-tect Michigan’s environmental heritage. Originally founded in 1967 as an all-volun-teer organization, the Sierra Club of Michigan is today comprised of 10 different branches that further its mission of grassroots activism in defense of the state’s environment. Through its advocacy and efforts, the Sierra Club has secured important protections and environ-mental safeguards that protect some of Michi-gan’s most well-known landmarks and natural spaces, including the Pictured Rocks and the Sleeping Bear Dunes. Additionally, the organi-zation has been instrumental in spurring Con-gress to ban drilling for oil under the Great Lakes and promoting environmentally sound resource management of the state’s forests and fisheries. The Sierra Club has also played a key role in passing legislation to mandate the use of renewable energy and establish strong energy efficiency standards for the State of Michigan. These policy solutions have had a positive impact on the public health of Michigan’s residents and the environment. Careful stewardship of the environment is critical to the future of Michigan, and the Si-erra Club of Michigan’s efforts over the past 50 years have helped institute safeguards that protect health and safety for future genera-tions. As the home of the Great Lakes and a wide variety of wildlife, Michigan’s environ-mental legacy is fundamental to its economy and the well-being of its citizens, and it is crit-ical that we continue to protect this important part of our state’s identity. Sierra Club of Michigan’s actions have been key to raising awareness and driving action to prevent harm to public health and the state’s nature re-sources, and it is my hope that the organiza-tion continues its great work in the coming years. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the Sierra Club of Michigan on the 50th Anniversary of its founding. The group and its members have helped safeguard Michigan’s environment and wildlife for future generations.

IN RECOGNITION OF TEAM MATHIAS 
HON. BARBARA COMSTOCK 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, June 12, 2017 Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize my constituents, Roya and Chris Giordano, and Team Mathias, an extraordinary non-profit organization located in Loudoun County, Virginia, for their work to increase awareness about pediatric cancer and also to support families whose loved ones are strug-gling with the disease. Team Mathias is named after Mathias Giordano, whose deter-mination to make a difference in the lives of other pediatric cancer patients resulted in the establishment of the organization, even as he struggled with bone cancer himself. Thirteen year old Mathias Giordano was a radiant light in this world whose optimism and valor gave assurance to young patients and their families that they are not alone in fighting the tragic disease of pediatric cancer that yearly afflicts over 10,000 children and remains the leading cause of death from disease among children in our nation. Team Mathias, led by Roya and Chris Gior-dano and in collaboration with enthusiastic and diligent volunteers, annually hosts the Team Mathias Golf Tournament, and the An-nual Team Mathias 5k Trail and Family Run that is taking place this year at the Evergreen Sportsplex in Leesburg. The proceeds from these events are used to increase awareness of all childhood cancers, raise funds for re-search, and make a donation to Special Love, a local non-profit that provides cancer families a community of support, made up of patients and families. In fulfillment of his own wishes, Team Mathias sends wonderful care packages to pediatric patients and their siblings, just as Mathias had specified. Since my time in the Virginia General As-sembly, advocating for those with pediatric cancer and working to find cures have been priorities of mine, and I take great pride in the number of family and community based orga-nizations in Virginia’s 10th District, like Team Mathias, that go above and beyond to spread awareness for those suffering from these ill-nesses. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing and thanking Roya and Chris Giordano and their team of volunteers, for the incredibly compassionate work of sup-porting families with loved ones who are fight-ing pediatric cancer. I also ask my colleagues that we remember Mathias, who faced his bat-tle with cancer with fearless courage, grace, and dignity. f

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, June 12, 2017 Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to rec-ognize Spencer Rohlwing, an Air Force Acad-emy Appointee from Colorado’s Fourth Con-gressional district. I believe our greatest as-sets are America’s brave men and women in uniform. Spencer is making an incredible sac-rifice for our country and deserves our utmost support for his service. It is with great pleas-ure that I give him my endorsement to attend this prestigious institution. Spencer has demonstrated outstanding aca-demic achievement, graduating Maxima Cum Laude and receiving a variety of awards dur-ing high school, including Highest Honors and the Gold Cross Award, both of which are given only to students who attain a GPA of 4.0 or higher. Additionally, Spencer was captain of both the Varsity Soccer team and the Varsity Track and Field team, showing his excellence in leadership and service. Our nation owes no greater debt of gratitude than to those who fight to protect our freedom and liberty. I commend Spencer and his family for their commitment. On behalf of the 4th Congressional District of Colorado, I extend my best wishes to Spencer. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to recognize Spencer Rohlwing as an appointee to the Air Force Academy for his commitment to protect and serve our nation.

RECOGNIZING THE RETIREMENT OF SOUTHWEST AIRLINES’ FIRST AFRICAN-AMERICAN CHIEF PILOT LOUIS ‘‘LOU’’ FREEMAN 
HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, June 12, 2017 Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the re-tirement of Southwest Airlines’ first African- American Chief Pilot Lou Freeman. On June 8, 2017, after 37 years of service, Captain Freeman announced his retirement. Captain Freeman will forever be remembered as the first African-American chief pilot for any airline. Captain Freeman served our amazing coun-try in the Air Force for six years, and will for-ever be the model of a modern Chief Pilot. His desire to be perfect was personified by his un-wavering commitment to the skies and his passengers. His most famous trip might have been when he flew Rosa Parks’ remains to her funeral, but the one that meant the most was his last which was full of family and friends. Today, Captain Freeman is set to celebrate his 65th birthday, and he deserves to be hon-ored for his dedication to our country. Since joining Southwest in 1980, Captain Freeman has been an example for so many Americans. In life, there are many successes and failures, but to strive for perfection and to do so every day is what separated Captain Freeman from his contemporaries. Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Captain Free-man on such a groundbreaking as well as bar-rier breaking career. More so, I wish Captain

I believe our greatest assets are America’s brave men and women in uniform. Scott is making an incredible sacrifice for our country and deserves our utmost support for his service.

He also served as captain of his school’s Cross Country and Track and Field teams. Addition-ally, Scott was elected Vice President and President of his class during his freshman and senior years of high school, respectively, dem-onstrating his commitment to leadership and passion for public service. Our nation owes no greater debt of gratitude than to those who fight to protect our freedom and liberty. I commend Scott and his family for their commitment. On behalf of the 4th Con-gressional District of Colorado, I extend my best wishes to Scott.

HONORING JIM VOLZ 
HON. PETER WELCH 
OF VERMONT  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, June 12, 2017 Mr. WELCH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to sa-lute Jim Volz, a public servant widely admired and respected, who retired on June 9, 2017, after 32 years of public service for the people of the State of Vermont. Jim served as Chair of the Vermont Public Service Board, a challenging and demanding role, guiding Vermont through a period of dra-matic change in the State’s energy policy. His reputation as thorough and fair, considerate and wise, was essential to the progress Vermont made during challenging times. As evidence of the high esteem Jim enjoys, he was first appointed by a Republican gov-ernor and then reappointed by a Democratic governor. Jim was seen by all as nonpartisan and scrupulously fair, with an incisive mind, even temperament, and gracious disposition. Before being appointed Chair of the Public Service Board, Jim served 20 years at the Vermont Department of Public Service—six-teen of those as Director of Public Advocacy. That totals 32 consequential years in the regu-latory arena. Vermont’s good fortune began in 1981 when Jim came to Vermont to clerk for Justice Franklin Billings on the Vermont Supreme Court. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the grateful State of Vermont, I say thank you to Jim Volz for his career of dedicated service to the people of Vermont.

INTRODUCTION OF THE PARIS ACT 
HON. EARL BLUMENAUER 
OF OREGON  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, June 12, 2017 Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, earlier this month, the president announced that he would withdraw from the non-binding Paris Agreement, undermining the credibility of the United States and displaying a complete dis-regard for the effects of climate change. This is unacceptable. Climate change is real. We are already ex-periencing rising sea levels and harsher storms at an accelerated pace, and without action, they are only going to get worse. Poll after poll show that the majority of American people support staying in the Paris Agree-ment, and the scientific community has reached a clear consensus that climate change is largely caused by human activity. In the face of these facts, the president con-tinues to undermine environmental protections and reject the science of climate change. The American people should not be respon-sible for bailing out leaders who ignore science to gain political points, while sub-jecting the United States—and the rest of the world—to the catastrophic effects of climate change. That’s why today I am introducing the Prohibiting Aid for Recipients Ignoring Science Act, or the PARIS Act, to ensure that any president has a stake in the catastrophic con-sequences of ignoring climate science. The PARIS Act would prevent properties owned by the president’s family from receiving federally subsidized flood insurance from the National Flood Insurance Program. The presi-dent should not be able to shift costs to tax-payers as he does business in flood-prone areas while withdrawing from efforts to miti-gate the impacts of climate change. I urge my colleagues to join me in working to give the president a stake in this fight and to take serious action on addressing climate change. The fate of our children, our grand-children, and the planet depends on it. f

It is with great pleasure that I give him my endorsement to attend this prestigious institution. Gianni has demonstrated excellent leader-ship and athleticism serving as captain of his school’s lacrosse team, and helping lead both the football and lacrosse teams to victory in the Colorado State Championships. Addition-ally, he was inducted into his school’s chapter of the National Honor Society and earned summa cum laude as a junior, showing his dedication to and passion for education. Our nation owes no greater debt of gratitude than to those who fight to protect our freedom and liberty. I commend Gianni and his family for their commitment.

This is the 18th national championship in the women’s tennis program’s outstanding his-tory and the 55th national title for Tyler Junior College. The TJC Apaches won their 2017 cham-pionship in a hard-fought victory against ASA Miami (FL), winning with 46 points to ASA Mi-ami’s 44, at the Reffkin Tennis Center in Tuc-son, Arizona. The Apache’s victory capped off an undefeated 21–0 regular season. Aside from winning the overall tournament, several team members excelled individually as well. Three TJC freshmen, Jasmine Asghar, Kalani Soli, and Yuna Ito each earned a sin-gles title. Ms. Soli and Montana Moore also brought home a doubles championship, win-ning 6–2; 6–2 in straight sets. Congratulations should also be extended to team members Mekeila Erspamer, Oceane Garibal, Elena Tendero, and Michelle Walker for their significant roles in bringing the entire team to victory. This recognition of their accomplishment is extended to all of the athletic staff including Head Coach John-Paul Connell, Assistant Coaches Kimm Ketelson and Brent Krivokapich. We must also extend accolades to TJC President Dr. L. Michael Metke, Assist-ant VP/Athletics and Student Life Dr. Tim Drain, Assistant Athletic Director Kelsi Weeks, Associate Athletic Director Chuck Smith, and Administrative Assistant Sherry Harwood. The faculty, staff, and friends of Tyler Junior College and the entire community of Tyler have devoted countless hours to support and encourage these outstanding young athletes in the pursuit of their dreams. It is my most esteemed honor to acknowl-edge everyone involved with this endeavor. May God continue to bless these students, their families and friends, and all those individ-uals who call Tyler, Texas their home.

CELEBRATING BARRY COOPER ON THE OCCASION OF HIS RETIRE-MENT 
HON. JANICE D. SCHAKOWSKY 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, June 12, 2017 Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Barry Cooper, who has dedicated 41 years to federal service. His work in the Federal Aviation Administration has ensured safer, more efficient travel for all Americans; and he is worthy of every recogni-tion he has received. Barry is retiring as the Regional Adminis-trator of the Great Lakes Region in Region and Property Operations in Des Plaines, Illi-nois. He began his career in federal service in 1976, working for 12 years as a civil engineer. Barry then became an Associate Program Manager in 1988 of Airway Facilities, now Technical Operations. He continued to move up in the FAA; and with each position he took on, the word ‘‘manager’’ was a recurrence in his title. This is indicative of Barry’s incredible leadership skills, showing a clear trust from his peers to grant Barry greater responsibility. Barry spearheaded the establishment of the Chicago Area Modernization Program Office in 2003. Nearly 15 years later, the office is still active. He created a team of people, each with diverse goals, and united them to build a coa-lition with the City of Chicago as operator of O’Hare International Airport. Through this of-fice, Barry facilitated a process in which the City of Chicago, through a reimbursement process, paid salaries for the extra employees needed to meet a shortened deadline for the Environmental Impact Statement. It has been a pleasure to work with Barry for the last 10 plus years. My office and I have worked closely with the FAA on many issues regarding O’Hare Airport, mainly as it relates to the O’Hare Modernization Program. Barry was our ‘‘go to’’ expert with any questions we had and he was always responsive and easy to reach. Even if he was travelling, he would call me or my staff back as soon as he land-ed. Over the years, my office has requested several meetings or briefings on different mat-ters and it was very easy to set up a meeting with Barry or his staff. Barry also had a way of taking complex technical matters and making them easy to understand. I recall attending the FAA work-shops at William Howard Taft High School in 2015 regarding the 2015 Re-Evaluation of the O’Hare Modernization Environmental Impact Statement. Barry walked around the audito-rium with me explaining the different poster boards displayed around the room. Barry’s knowledge was so vast and he was always so kind, with that infectious smile on his face. I will miss working with him. Please join me in recognizing all the con-tributions Barry Cooper has made over the last 41 years. I extend my best wishes to Barry as he enters this new stage in life and makes many more wonderful memories with his wife, children, and grandchildren. f 
CELEBRATING THE 80TH BIRTH-DAY OF FORMER NHTSA ADMIN-ISTRATOR AND CONSUMER AD-VOCATE JOAN B. CLAYBROOK 
HON. JANICE D. SCHAKOWSKY 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, June 12, 2017 Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 80th birthday of an out-standing consumer advocate and dear friend, Joan B. Claybrook. Joan has championed consumer safety both inside and outside of government. She started her public service as an analyst at the Social Security Administration. In 1966, Congress created the National Traffic Safety Bureau— now the National Highway Traffic Safety Ad-ministration (NHTSA). Joan joined the new agency early on, helping to set the foundation for auto safety policy in this country. She left NHTSA to work at U.S. Public Interest Re-search Group and Public Citizen before return-ing in 1977 to serve as NHTSA Administrator under President Jimmy Carter. Joan’s post-government career is equally distinguished. For 27 years, she served as President of Public Citizen, a leading advo-cacy organization for health, safety, account-ability, and fairness. As ranking member of the subcommittee with jurisdiction over auto safe-ty, I have worked with Joan many times over the years on issues from requiring rear back- up cameras to stopping the sale of cars under recall. She testifies frequently before my sub-committee, and I always value her insight. Even after she retired as President of Public Citizen, Joan remains a strong advocate for consumers. She continues to serve on the Public Citizen board and as Co-Chair of Advo-cates for Highway and Auto Safety. When a pressing auto safety issue arises, I know it is only a matter of time before I hear from Joan. People owe their lives to Joan Claybrook’s public service and advocacy. That is why her extraordinary work has been recognized by prominent institutions, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, Consumer Federation of America, and Georgetown Law Center. As Joan celebrates her 80th birthday, I want to celebrate her enormous contribution to con-sumer safety. Every American goes through the day a little safer because of Joan. f
