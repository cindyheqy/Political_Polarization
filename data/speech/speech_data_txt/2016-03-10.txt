PRAYER Reverend Michael Siconolfi, Society of Jesus, Quantico, Virginia, offered the following prayer: Lord, You are the author and sus-tainer of our lives; Yours is the love that bears mercy and the sweet waters that never run dry. By the power of Your word, You stilled the chaos of pri-meval seas, made the raging waters of the flood subside and etched the chan-nels of fruitful rivers from the Jordan to the Nile, from the Mississippi to the Rio Grande. We gather this day not far from the river called Potomac to pray for Your blessing upon the Members of this House. Much has been given them; and from them much will be required. As-sist them with Your help that they may arrive at the final rollcall vote in Your grace and favor. Grant all of us here on the shores of this nearby river a sense of hope as we strive to be instruments of Your peace. ‘‘In this brief transit . . . teach us to care and not to care. Teach us to sit still. Our peace is in Your will.’’ We ask this for Your greater glory. Amen. THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-ant to section 2(a) of House Resolution 635, the Journal of the last day’s pro-ceedings is approved. f

I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Repub-lic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f

You are the giver of everlasting life, and noth-ing can separate us from Your limitless love. You know us better than we know ourselves, and You work for the good of those who love You. You have given us the privilege to be called Your chil-dren. Give our Senators today a faith suffi-cient for these challenging times. May their trust in You empower them to solve problems, to conquer tempta-tions, and to live more nearly as they ought. Remind them that all things are possible to those who believe.

COMPREHENSIVE ADDICTION AND RECOVERY BILL AND FILLING THE SUPREME COURT VACANCY Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, later this morning the Senate will have an opportunity to take decisive action to address our Nation’s devastating prescription opioid and heroin epi-demic. The Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act is good legislation that will help tackle this crisis by expand-ing education and prevention initia-tives, improving treatment programs, and bolstering law enforcement efforts. This authorization bill, in conjunction with the $400 million appropriated for opioid-specific programs just a few months ago, can make important strides in combating the growing ad-diction and overdose problem we have seen in every one of our States. In Kentucky, what we have seen is some of the highest drug overdose rates in the country, and we know all too well that the work that must be done to overcome this crisis lies before us. Kentuckians also know the positive impact this legislation can have. Let me remind you of what a top anti-drug official from Northern Ken-tucky said about CARA. She said this bill ‘‘will address the growing needs of our communities in getting appro-priate treatment to those who are suf-fering . . . [and] allow individuals, fam-ilies, and communities to heal from this scourge.’’ So we will keep working hard to build on these efforts so that fewer Americans ever have to know the heartache of drug addiction and over-dose. I appreciate the work of Senators on both sides of the aisle to advance this bill. On the Democratic side, that in-cludes the junior Senator from Rhode Island and the senior Senator from Minnesota. On the Republican side, that includes Senator AYOTTE from New Hampshire. She cares deeply about this issue and has studied the problem carefully. She has seen the ef-fect it has had on her home State, and she has worked hard to do something about it. Now, of course, today’s vote on CARA would not have been possible at all without the leadership and work of other colleagues. I particularly want to mention Senator PORTMAN from Ohio, who has been involved with this for several years, from the very beginning, in developing this important legisla-tion for our country. He has worked diligently over the past few years as the lead Republican sponsor of this much-needed bill. He has held many meetings and expert conferences to get an even greater understanding of the issue. We appreciate the long hours he has devoted to addressing this national crisis through the legislation we will pass today. And of course, we thank the senior Senator from Iowa, Mr. G
RASSLEY , the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, for everything he has done to make this moment possible. He understands the urgency of addressing this epi-demic, and we all appreciate the very important role he played in guiding this legislation to passage. Indeed, this critical legislation to ad-dress America’s national drug epidemic languished in a previous Senate Judici-ary Committee, but then Chairman G
RASSLEY came along. Under a new chairman and a new Republican major-ity, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act became a real priority. It passed the committee swiftly, and it will pass the Senate today. Important legislation to help the vic-tims of modern slavery languished in a previous Senate Judiciary Committee, but then Chairman G
RASSLEY came along. Under a new chairman and a new Republican majority, the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act became a real priority. It passed the committee swiftly, and then it passed the Senate. The list goes on. Here is the chair-man who has worked to give voices to the voiceless. He also has a passion for letting Iowans and the American peo-ple be heard. No wonder he is working so hard now to give the people a voice in the direction of the Supreme Court. The next Supreme Court Justice could dramatically change the direc-tion of the Court and our country for a

generation. It is a change in direction that could have significant implica-tions for the rights we hold dear. That includes our Second Amendment rights and our First Amendment rights, things such as Americans’ ability to speak out politically and practice their religion freely. The American people obviously de-serve to have a voice in this matter. It is the fairest and most reasonable ap-proach we could take. During our cur-rent national conversation, Americans could make their voices heard on the kind of judicial philosophy they favor. One view says that judges should be committed to an even-handed interpre-tation of the law and the Constitution so that every American gets a fair shake. Another view—the so-called em-pathy standard that President Obama favors—says that judges should, on critical questions, rely on their per-sonal ideology to resolve a case. I know which view Justice Scalia took. He said that setting aside one’s personal views is one of the primary qualifications for a judge. ‘‘If you’re going to be a good and faithful judge, you have to resign yourself to the fact you’re not always going to like the conclusions you reach.’’ The American people will have the chance to make their voices heard in the matter, and that is thanks to a dedicated Senator from Iowa who con-tinues to stand strong for Americans’ right to have a say. Chairman G
RASS -
LEY has gotten a lot done under the new majority, just as the Senate has gotten a lot done under the new major-ity. We will mark another important accomplishment for the American peo-ple this morning with the passage of CARA. Now Senators have a choice. Sen-ators can endlessly debate an issue where the parties don’t agree or they can keep working together in areas where we do. I say we should continue doing our work, and the American peo-ple should continue making their voices heard. That is good for the coun-try, and that is the best way forward now.

COMPREHENSIVE ADDICTION AND RECOVERY BILL Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are cer-tainly pleased we are going to pass this opioid bill shortly. Everyone should understand that the bill would have had some meat if, in fact, we had an opportunity to adopt the Shaheen amendment. It would have funded the authorization that we are now talking about. My friend always talks about the $470 million. That has already been obli-gated. That was last year’s obligation to take care of this issue. This author-ization bill has no money. For my friend to say we have $470 million is certainly not a factual statement. f 
FILLING THE SUPREME COURT VACANCY Mr. REID. Mr. President, 3 years ago voters went to the ballot to elect a President of the United States, the most powerful Nation in the world. The American people spoke, and they over-whelmingly elected President Obama to a second term. We know that my friend the Repub-lican leader stated that the Repub-licans had two goals: No. 1, to make sure that Obama was not reelected; and No. 2, that they would oppose every-thing Obama tried to do. On the first, they were a failure. Obama was re-elected with more than 5 million votes. The other agreement the Republicans made was to oppose everything that Obama wanted to do or tried do, and they have stuck with that. That is why we have had 7 years of turmoil, 7 years of not doing nearly as much as we should, 7 years of endless filibusters. So my friend the Republican leader can talk all he wants about the progress made last year, but anyone studying what has gone on in the Sen-ate recognizes that simply is without any basis. We have done so little that some political scientists say it is the most unproductive year that has ever been spent in Washington. But 3 years ago, voters went to the ballot box to elect a President. The American people spoke. They spoke loudly, as I have in-dicated, and they overwhelmingly elected Barack Obama for a second term. It was a 4-year term he was elected to, not a 3-year term—a 4-year term. During the Presidential term of of-fice, our President has obligations— constitutional obligations. But Repub-licans continue to reject that election. They continue to reject Barack Obama’s Presidency. They say he is il-legitimate. They continue to reject the will of the people. When he was reelected overwhelm-ingly, obviously, they gave him the constitutional powers to do whatever is within the Constitution. One of those is to nominate Supreme Court Jus-tices, just as he did in his first term. Yet the Republican leader and the sen-ior Senator from Iowa remain com-mitted to blocking the President’s nominee. They are not following the Constitution. Republicans are not fol-lowing the Constitution. The whole country is taking note. But the State of Iowa is taking special note. Earlier this week, a mother wrote an open letter to Senator G
RASSLEY that appeared in the Des Moines Register. Here is what she said: 
Refusal to abide by the tenants of our Con-stitution, and confirm a qualified candidate to the Supreme Court, is a violation of our common values. Your example to my chil-dren is that it doesn’t really matter what the rules say; if the stakes are high enough and the chips don’t fall your way, it’s OK to arbi-trarily change the rules and deny the other player his/her turn. That is the Senate Republicans’ les-son to the people who elected them. It doesn’t matter who you elected for President, we will refuse to do our duty just to follow Donald Trump’s example. Remember what Donald Trump told all of my Republican friends and the coun-try on the Supreme Court nomination. Here is his very, very detailed expla-nation of what he wants to do. Here is what he said: ‘‘Delay, delay, delay.’’ Then he went on to something else. The Republicans have followed that. Yesterday, Professor Jonathan Carl-son of the University of Iowa—he is a professor of law there—published an op-ed in the Cedar Rapids Gazette, a newspaper in Iowa. In the editorial, Professor Carlson wrote: 
Grassley’s decision [will] rob Americans of their voice. 
He went on to say: 
The voters elected President Obama to fill the next Supreme Court vacancy, and that vacancy is now upon us. Obama should be al-lowed to do the job he was elected to do. Grassley’s problem isn’t that he wants to give the American people a chance to decide this issue. His problem is that he doesn’t like the decision they already made. 
Republicans should not ignore the voice of the people just because they don’t like what the American people declared, but that is just what the sen-ior Senator from Iowa continues to do—ignore the people of Iowa and the rest of America. Thirty years ago, Senator G
RASSLEY  had it right. When the Judiciary Com-mittee began its consideration of the elevation of Justice Rehnquist to be Chief Justice, he said: ‘‘This com-mittee has the obligation to build a record and to conduct the most in- depth inquiry that we can.’’ Let me re-peat that. ‘‘This committee’’—he is re-ferring to the Judiciary Committee— ‘‘has the obligation to build a record and to conduct the most in-depth in-quiry that we can.’’ Now Senator G
RASSLEY isn’t inter-ested in inquiries or building a record. He refuses to meet with the nominee, even if the nominee is from Iowa. He refuses to hold a hearing, and he re-fuses, of course, to have a vote. Senator G
RASSLEY isn’t interested in inquiries or building a record. Through his obstruction, he is already choosing to close the door on a potential nomi-nee. He has even said that he will not consider the nomination of his fellow Iowan Judge Jane Kelly, even though she was overwhelmingly elevated from the trial court to the appellate court in this body with, of course, Senator G
RASSLEY leading the charge on her be-half. So what he said about his fellow Iowan, Jane Kelly, is a little strange— a little odd—because it was Senator G
RASSLEY who strongly supported Judge Kelly and pushed her confirma-tion to the Eighth Circuit Court of Ap-peals. Senator G
RASSLEY says he will preemptively reject Judge Kelly, or

any nominee, out of—listen to this one—principle, and that is because Re-publicans’ only principle is obstruc-tion. As chairman of the Judiciary Com-mittee, he has fallen in line with the Republican leader’s obstruction and followed what Donald Trump has sug-gested: Delay, delay, delay. He is going to great lengths to shut down voices who simply want to do their jobs. For example, at the behest of the Repub-lican leader, he met privately with Re-publicans on the Judiciary Committee and twisted his colleagues’ arms to sign a loyalty oath, promising to block consideration of the President’s nomi-nees. That point has already been made here and is a part of the R
ECORD . Next, he tried to move a committee markup behind closed doors. When Democrats objected, he canceled the meeting. He also used the Presiding Officer’s chair here on the floor to shut down debate on the Supreme Court vacancy, which is really unheard of, but he did it. Time and again, the senior Senator from Iowa has followed the orders of the Republican leader and Donald Trump and sought to silence his critics and shut the American people out of the Senate’s business. Why? If the Sen-ator’s obstruction is truly supported by the Constitution and history, why wouldn’t he want to have a debate in the open? Let’s debate it on the Senate floor. President Obama’s nominee de-serves a meeting, a hearing, and a vote. The American people deserve a Senate that honors the Constitution and pro-vides its advice and consent on Su-preme Court nominees. As Professor Carlson said, by refus-ing to give President Obama’s nominee consideration, Senator G
RASSLEY is robbing Iowans and Americans of their voice. Listening to the American peo-ple is our job, and Senate Republicans should do their job. Mr. President, what is the Senate business today?

NATIONAL SECURITY SATELLITE LAUNCHES Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, yester-day the senior Senator from Arizona took to the floor to criticize the work of the Defense Appropriations Sub-committee. I am honored to be on that subcommittee as the vice chairman and to work with Senator COCHRAN , the Republican from Mississippi. The senior Senator from Arizona ar-gued that the support for Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump is somehow connected to the work of the Defense Appropriations Sub-committee. I have heard some pretty outlandish claims by Mr. Trump on the campaign trail, but the fact that he would capture the hearts and minds of the Defense Appropriations Sub-committee with his rhetoric is beyond me. Senator C
OCHRAN has been a Member of the Senate for many years. He is re-spected and has worked his way up to be chairman of the full committee. I have worked with him and found him to be an excellent partner. He is bipar-tisan and tries to make sure that we protect our Nation’s national defense. I have never found him to be in the thrall of Donald Trump, but that sug-gestion was made yesterday by the sen-ior Senator from Arizona. I will leave it to the American people to judge the wisdom or absurdity of that allegation. I would like to take a moment to cor-rect the record on a few of the things that the senior Senator from Arizona said. The issues involved are pretty complex, but the crux of it comes down to this: The senior Senator from Ari-zona is proposing to waste $1.5 billion— and perhaps as much as $5 billion—on a controversial proposal on how the De-partment of Defense and intelligence agencies should launch national secu-rity satellites. In addition to costing billions of dollars—that is billions, not millions—the senior Senator from Ari-zona’s proposal is opposed by the Sec-retary of Defense, Ash Carter; the Di-rector of National Intelligence, James Clapper; the Under Secretary of De-fense, Frank Kendall; and the Sec-retary of the Air Force, Deborah James. One would think that the sen-ior Senator from Arizona, who chairs the Defense Authorization Committee, would note that it is unified opposition from the Department of Defense to his ideas. Each of these individuals has ex-pressed strong concern about the ideas of the senior Senator from Arizona. They have stated as clearly as they can and as often as they can that what he has in mind will harm our national se-curity. They have even stated it in the senior Senator’s committee hearings. He is either not listening, paying at-tention, or refusing to agree. Neverthe-less, all that I did, all that the Senate has done last year with Senator C
OCH-
RANon a bipartisan basis, was to listen to our senior national security leaders while protecting taxpayers from wast-ing billions of dollars. The matter generating all of this dis-cussion is about competition for launching defense satellites into space. Let me tell you at the outset that be-fore I came to the subcommittee, we made a terrible decision. About 10 years ago, the two leading competitors for launching satellites into space were two private companies, Boeing Aircraft and Lockheed. They came to the gov-ernment with a suggestion, and they said: We’ve got a great idea. Instead of competing against one another to launch satellites—listen to this—we will merge our companies together, and we will save the government lots of money. I don’t know why, but the De-partment of Defense and the commit-tees on Capitol Hill bought it, and they created the United Launch Alliance, or ULA. It became a monopoly. These two merged corporations became a monop-oly in launching satellites. You know what happens when you have monopoly status? The costs go up dramatically, and that is exactly what happened. In the last 10 years, United Launch Alliance has been a reliable partner with the Department of Defense, and they have launched satellites and other things into space which have been crit-ical for national security. But because they are a monopoly with no competi-tion, they became very expensive. There are new entries in the market that are promising in terms of launch-ing satellites, and one of them is SpaceX. SpaceX has matured into a company that can play an important role in the future of satellite launches. I noted this fact, and as chairman of the Defense Appropriations Sub-committee, I did something that is un-usual by Capitol Hill standards. In Jan-uary of 2014, I held a hearing. At the same table I invited the CEO of United Launch Alliance and the CEO of SpaceX to sit next to one another and testify. They answered questions about their capabilities and about the history of space launch in the future. The com-mittee members asked them how they could save money, and each of them re-sponded. At the end of the hearing, I suggested to each of the CEOs that they propound up to 10 questions to the other CEO that they didn’t think were covered in our hearing. I tried to make this as open as possible and to invite a new competitive spirit when it came to these space launches. I think it was constructive. It is also clear that there is another element in this issue that brought the senior Senator from Arizona to the floor. The United Launch Alliance has several engines that can take a sat-ellite into space. The most economical one, the RD–180, is not built in Amer-ica. It is built in Russia. Now, that has become a major problem. Put Vladimir Putin and his adventurism to the side here. I have even joined with the senior Senator from Arizona, condemning what Putin has done in countries such as Georgia and Ukraine and his threats to the Baltics and Poland. Put that over to the side for a moment. It is best for us to make our own engines when it comes to the launching of sat-ellites for America’s national defense and intelligence. We put millions of dollars in the appropriations bill to incentivize the building of a new en-gine so we can finally break away from our dependence on this Russian RD–180 engine. For 2 years we have been put-ting that money in the bill.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES1400 March 10, 2016 
I am not opposed to competition. I favor competition. I favor an Amer-ican-made engine. That is not the issue. Here is the problem: You can’t just waive a wand or pass an appropria-tion and recreate a new rocket engine. It can take up to 5 years. What will happen in that 5-year period of time while we in America are developing at least one new American-made reliable rocket engine? We will have to be de-pendent either on that Russian engine in transition or run the risk that we are not going to have any engines available when we desperately need them for satellite launches. That is ex-actly what the Secretary of Defense has told the senior Senator from Ari-zona, and he just will not buy it. He has said: We have to cut the cord and walk away from the Russian engines. Here is something he can’t answer: NASA also uses engines to launch sat-ellites and people into space. Why would we launch people into space? For the space station. How do we get those folks up to the space station and bring them home? On Russian rocket en-gines. If the senior Senator from Arizona says that’s it, cold turkey, no more Russian engines, what in the world is he going to do about NASA’s needs for this engine in supplying the space sta-tion and making sure that the folks in orbit can safely come home? He can’t answer that question because the an-swer truly tells him the problem he is creating here. What we are trying to do is this: Transition to American-made engines. I am for that. Create competition for space launches in the future. I am for that. And make sure we do it in a thoughtful, sensible way and not at the expense of America’s national defense, our national intelligence, or the future of our space program. We can work with the Senator from Arizona. I would like to do that, but when he comes to the floor and suggests that all of us who oppose him are somehow cronies of Vladimir Putin or marching to the or-ders of Donald Trump, it doesn’t create a very productive environment for con-versation. Let’s do the right thing. Let’s work together on an appropriations author-ization. Let’s put the Russian engines behind us in an orderly way, let’s cre-ate the American engine, and let’s push for competition. That is where I got started on this, and that is where I am today. We need to listen to the experts—the experts at the Pentagon—who have told us repeatedly that to do this cold turkey and to cut off the Russian en-gines is, frankly, to jeopardize our na-tional defense, security, intelligence gathering, and even our space program. That is something I hope the senior Senator from Arizona can agree is an outcome which we should avoid. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. R
OUNDS ). The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. f 
COMPREHENSIVE ADDICTION AND RECOVERY BILL Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise to address an issue we are confronting in the Senate, and it is an issue folks in Pennsylvania and across the country are dealing with every day; that is, the opioid crisis. There are a lot of ways to describe this crisis. I am pleased to be able to talk about this issue with two of my colleagues who will be following me in succession after my remarks have concluded. This Senator wants to thank, in a particular way, Senator W
HITEHOUSE , Senator S
HAHEEN , and our leadership for bringing this issue to the forefront within our caucus and here in the Sen-ate. I know the effort to pass the Com-prehensive Addiction and Recovery Act—known by the acronym CARA—is a bipartisan effort. I certainly appre-ciate that. In the case of Senator W
HITEHOUSE , he brings a deep reservoir of experience as a Federal prosecutor, U.S. attorney, as well as the attorney general of Rhode Island. He brings a law enforce-ment set of experience as well as his caring and concern about those who have addiction issues. We appreciate his leadership. Senator B
ROWN has worked on this for many years in the Senate and as a Member of the House of Representatives. This is an issue that confronts all of us in our States. Our efforts have to be commensurate to match the severity of the problem. This week the Senate missed an im-portant opportunity to invest substan-tial resources in our Nation’s heroin crisis. The amendment offered by Sen-ators S
HAHEEN and W HITEHOUSE would have provided $600 million in emer-gency funding to aid public health pro-fessionals and law enforcement, the two main segments of our society that deal with the challenge of addiction on a daily basis. That amendment was de-feated, and I think that was the wrong conclusion for the Senate and wrong for the country. While the Senate failed to act on this amendment, there is no reason we shouldn’t find other opportunities to invest in anti-heroin strategies or, ex-pressed another way, strategies that will lessen or reduce the likelihood that more people will be addicted to some opioid which often leads to other kinds of challenges such as heroin. It too often leads not just to the darkness of addiction but literally to the dark-ness of death itself. We have some work to do. We know we can pass the Comprehen-sive Addiction and Recovery Act, the CARA Act, as I mentioned before. That is good, but it is not nearly enough. We have to do more than simply pass good legislation that will authorize policies to better confront the challenge. That will not be enough. If we have in place new programs, new approaches, and new strategies, that is a measure of progress, but we can’t ask medical pro-fessionals to do more to treat addiction if they don’t have the resources. We cannot ask law enforcement to do more if they don’t have the resources. Heroin overdose deaths have in-creased 244 percent from 2007 to 2013. In roughly a 6-year timeframe, heroin overdose deaths are up 244 percent. It is hard to even comprehend that kind of increase of a death statistic—not just a number but a number that indicates the increase in the number of deaths. That alone should motivate us to do everything possible to do whatever it takes. Whatever authority, whatever policy, whatever dollars we need to in-vest in this, we have to do that. There are lots of other numbers, and some-times you can get lost in reciting the numbers. I will mention a few that are relevant to Pennsylvania before I con-clude. In addition to just passing the CARA bill, we ought to focus on taking meas-urable steps to solve the crisis. We don’t want to just address the issue, confront the challenge, we want to solve the crisis. It will not happen in 1 year, and it will not happen because of one bill or one policy, but we have to put every possible resource or tool on the table to actually solve the crisis. There are lots of ways to illustrate the degree of the problem. I will talk about a couple of communities in Pennsylvania, just by way of example. The Washington Post—a great news-paper here—went to Washington, PA. We have a county and city just below the city of Pittsburgh, just south of Pittsburgh, Washington County and the city of Washington. The Post went there last summer and began to inter-view people at the local level. In one of the more stunning statis-tics they found in their reporting, in 70 minutes there were eight overdoses re-lated to heroin—in this case not yet deaths but overdoses. A newspaper could track in 1 hour 10 minutes, eight overdoses in one community in one State. Then they tracked it over a 2- day timeframe. In 48 hours there were 25 overdoses in Washington County, PA, and 3 deaths, in a 48-hour period. I cite that not just for the compelling nature of those numbers but because of where it happened. This is not hap-pening in communities we used to think of as having a major heroin or drug addiction problem. We tended to think of it, at least in my lifetime, as being an urban issue that big cities have this problem and less so in small towns, suburbs, and rural communities. In this case, this horror, this evil knows no geographic or class bound-aries. It is happening in big cities and very small towns in Pennsylvania. It is happening in suburban communities, high- and low-income communities and

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S1401 March 10, 2016 
in middle-income communities. It is happening everywhere. There is no es-caping it. If it is happening in places like Wash-ington County—the city of Wash-ington, PA, is not a big city but a mod-erate-sized city. Other parts of that county tend to be more rural, small towns to rural. If it is happening there in those kinds of numbers, in 70 min-utes or 48 hours, overdoses and over-dose deaths, that gives you an indica-tion of the gravity of the problem. The Coroners Association in Pennsyl-vania, which has to track the number of deaths in their counties, reported that in just over a few years in Penn-sylvania, the number of deaths from overdoses went from less than 50 to hundreds of deaths in just a couple of years. The gravity of this problem is self-evident. It is not good enough to diagnose the problem and recite statistics. We have to solve the crisis. There is no doubt this is a huge issue for the country. By not passing the funding that we tried to pass, we are missing a chance to support, for example, the substance abuse prevention and treatment block grant, the so-called SABG, or the SA block grant. That is an existing pro-gram—an existing block grant pro-gram—that works. The only good news here, in this debate about what policy to put in place, is that local officials know what they are doing. Addiction and medical professionals know ex-actly what to do. They know exactly what works. They know exactly what they need. What they are asking us for is a little bit of policy or a significant amount of policy, maybe. But they are also asking for research and resources, and we have to give those resources to them. I conclude with the following. We know that good treatment works. All the professionals tells us it works. We know so much more today than we did 25 years ago about what works. We know that good treatment works. It takes a long time. There is no 90-day program here because it takes a lot longer than that. So we know that for sure. There is no dispute about that. We also know that good treatment costs money. You cannot just have good intentions here. Lifesaving overdose reversal drugs such as naloxone cost money. The good news is we have a drug to reverse the adverse impact of an overdose, and yet a lot of communities cannot afford to get this very important drug called naloxone, the so-called reversal drug as some call it. Intercepting drugs before they reach our streets costs money. The worse this epidemic gets, the more these services are in demand. So Congress—the Senate and the House of Representatives—must pro-vide additional funding to make sure local communities can meet the de-mand. We know that investing in pro-grams that treat addiction and save lives is an abiding obligation. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. F
ISCHER ). The time of the Senator has expired. Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 30 additional seconds. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. CASEY. It is an abiding obliga-tion that we must fulfill. We have to tackle this problem. We can’t do it without resources. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Rhode Island. Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam Presi-dent, I am delighted to join Senator C
ASEY of Pennsylvania and Senator B
ROWN of Ohio on the floor this morn-ing to applaud what appears to be the imminent passage of the Comprehen-sive Addiction and Recovery Act. So far we have had less than a handful of votes against this bill at any stage through the voting on it, and I suspect that some of those votes may have had to do with amendments and so forth. We might even do better than that on final passage. I thank my cosponsors. This was not a bill that was just dreamed up in back offices. We had five national seminars in Washington, bringing people in from all around the country to share their experiences, to share their advice, to share their best practices, and to in-form the development of this bill. It has been years of work in the making. On our side of the aisle, Senator K
LO-
BUCHAR has been an extremely valuable colleague. On the other side of the aisle, Senator P
ORTMAN and Senator A
YOTTE were our coconspirators on this bill. I thank them and extend my ap-preciation to all of them. This truly is a comprehensive bill: everything from at the point of over-dose getting naloxone into the hands of first responders so that lives can be saved; through the prescribing process and the prescription drug monitoring process; through a whole variety of new treatment programs; and through intervention for people who are incar-cerated and the prevention of incarcer-ation, particularly for our people in veterans courts and so forth, who can be diverted out of the prison system through new means of treatment such as medically assisted treatment that is emerging as a very promising new strategy; and all the way, ultimately, to disposal of excess drugs. This truly is a comprehensive bill. Its only faults are ones that the Re-publican leadership are in a terrific po-sition to remedy, if they would. The first is that there is no addi-tional funding to support any of these new programs that I have described. The funding for the accounts in ques-tion was determined months and months and months ago in the Appro-priations Committee before anybody could know what this bill was going to look like on the floor. When the final deal was reached, the numbers actually matched the Presi-dent’s budget, and the President’s budget was issued even before the ap-propriations measure came out of its relevant subcommittee. So the Presi-dent’s budget folks would have had to have been astonishing masters of pre-diction in order to put in money for programs that weren’t even law at that time. There has been considerable com-mentary from the other side that there is funding for this, but what they over-look is that, yes, there is funding for these programs, but you would have to take it away from other treatment and recovery programs to fund these. It would be robbing Peter to pay Paul. Now, an argument could be made that under this bill, Paul will be a more effective program than the pre- CARA Peter would have been, and, therefore, robbing Peter to pay Paul is a net good. But, please, let’s not pre-tend there is money for this. If there is one indication of how there really isn’t new money for this, it is the fact that our friends on the other side can’t agree on how much money there is for this. Some Senators have said that there is $78 million for funding CARA. The majority leader has said there is $400 million to fund CARA. The deputy majority leader has said there is $517 million to fund CARA. If the money were real, I sus-pect they could agree on the amount of it. I think the fact of the matter is that there is no new money for this, and the sooner we can get this funded, the sooner it will save lives. The second problem is that the House, under Republican leadership, has taken no action on this bill. No committee has taken it up and passed it. So I take this opportunity to call on the leadership here and in the House to put money where their proverbial mouth is to pass this bill, to get some funding behind it—Senator S
HAHEEN ’s measure would have been terrific—and to get some action out of their col-leagues in the House. If we pass it in the Senate and the House takes no ac-tion, this will be a sham, and that will have been a shame. With that, I yield the floor for Sen-ator B
ROWN . The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Ohio. Mr. BROWN. Thank you, Madam President. Thank you to my colleagues for the terrific work they have done on such an important issue, which in my State sort of began in the most rural of the areas of the State and spread and spread and spread. This is the right kind of comprehensive response for this, but as Senator W
HITEHOUSE just said, it means real funding for CARA and what we are doing. I am pleased we are coming together in a bipartisan way overall, finally tak-ing action on the opioid epidemic that is devastating communities across our country. We know some of the statistics. More people died in my State than in the country as a whole in 2015 from opioid

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES1402 March 10, 2016 
overdoses rather than they did from auto accidents. We are experiencing a record number of fatal overdoses. There is no State and probably county untouched by the scourge. We need to remember the human cost of addiction. In Warren, OH, a couple of weeks ago, there was middle-age woman who now has a child now in his midtwenties who has suffered addiction for a dozen years, has been in and out and is doing better, and then falls back. His family is affluent, so his treatment has been better than some. But she says that when there is an ad-diction, it afflicts the whole family. Nobody is really exempt. In my State, 2,500 Ohio families in one year lost a loved one to addiction. Thousands more continued to struggle with opioid abuse or with a family member’s addiction. It is not an indi-vidual problem or a character flaw. It is a chronic disease. Right now, it is placing an unbearable burden on fami-lies and communities in our health care system. That is why we need to tackle this at the national level. It is why I am encouraged to see us debate this Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, or the CARA Act. The ideas in this bill are an important first step in tackling the epidemic, but they are just the first step. On their own they are not nearly enough to put a dent in this epidemic. The initiatives are going to mean very little—and here is the key point that both Senator C
ASEY and Senator W HITEHOUSE made— without additional funding to back them up. My colleagues Senator S
HAHEEN of New Hampshire and Senator W
HITE-
HOUSE introduced an amendment that would have provided an additional $600 million to fight the opioid epidemic. That would be a serious commitment in putting the ideas in this bill into place into action. But my colleagues on the other side of the aisle blocked this investment. Again, they want to do things on the cheap. They want to pass things to pat ourselves on the back but not provide the funding to actually accomplish things. It would block the investment in health professionals and commu-nities who are on the frontlines of this battle. You simply can’t do a roundtable with health professionals and people working toward recovery and families affected by it without hearing from them. They need resources locally. The States aren’t coming up with it ade-quately. They need resources, and they need real investment in prevention pro-grams. We need real investment in treatment options to help patients not just get cured and get clean but stay clean. Earlier this year, I introduced the Heroin and Prescription Drug Abuse Prevention and Reduction Act with my colleague Senator B
ALDWIN of Wis-consin. Our bill would boost prevention efforts that would improve tools for crisis response. It would expand access to treatment, and it would provide sup-port for lifelong recovery, the kind of serious investment we need to back up our rhetoric. In public health emergencies, we are sometimes, somehow able to come up with necessary money—swine flu, Ebola, Zika virus. But addiction is not a public health emergency. Addiction is a public health problem, but one we need to fund in an ongoing way. You can look at the spike in the number of deaths. You can conclude nothing else but that it is a long-term public health problem. Too many lives have been de-stroyed. Too many communities have been devastated. I am just puzzled why my colleagues won’t come up with $600 million for this very important public health program. It is time to get seri-ous. It is time to call it what it is—the public health crisis that demands real and immediate investment, not more empty rhetoric, not more empty ges-tures. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Wyoming. Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 10 minutes in morning business. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. f 
FILLING THE SUPREME COURT VACANCY Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I come to the floor today to talk about what I have been hearing from people in Wyoming about the issue of whether President Obama should nominate the next Supreme Court Justice. This past last weekend, I was around the State of Wyoming in Rock Springs, in Rawlings, and in Casper and the weekend before that, as well, in Casper, Cheyenne, and Big Piney. I am hearing the same thing from all around the State of Wyoming. What I am hearing is that President Obama should not be the one to put an-other nominee on the Supreme Court and that it should come down to the people: Give the people a voice. That is what I am hearing back home. The chairman of the Judiciary Com-mittee, Senator G
RASSLEY , is doing ex-actly what the people of Wyoming are insisting upon—the right thing. He is doing the right thing by insisting that the American people decide. I think Senator G
RASSLEY is doing a great service to this body, to the American people, and also to whomever the next President nominates for the Supreme Court. On Monday, after traveling around the State of Wyoming, Senator E
NZI, who had also traveled around the State of Wyoming this past weekend, and I jointly held a telephone townhall meeting. Folks at home are very famil-iar with these. We do these just about every month. We have a chance to visit with people about what is on their mind. Then there is a little way you can do a poll during that telephone townhall meeting, and 88 percent of the people of Wyoming agree with Senator GRASSLEY , agree with Senator E NZIand with me about the next Supreme Court Justice and giving the people a voice. Democrats want to turn this all around into a fight on the Senate floor. They want this to be a backroom deal between the President and the special interest groups. These are the groups that are pushing the President to ap-point someone who will rule the way they want. But that is not what the American people want. The American people—and certainly the people in Wyoming—want this to be a fight about what happens and what they decide in the voting booth in November. When an election is just months away, the people should be al-lowed to consider possible Supreme Court nominees as one factor in decid-ing whom they will support for Presi-dent. This shouldn’t really even be con-troversial. Democrats in the past have come to the floor, and they said it would be a bad idea to let the President make a lifetime appointment in his last months in office. In 1992 Senator J
OE B
IDEN came to the Senate floor to ex-plain his rule. He called it the Biden rule, and it had to do with Supreme Court nominations. On the Senate floor, J
OEBIDEN—now the Vice President, former chairman of the Judiciary Committee—said that once the Presidential election is under-way—and I will tell you, Madam Presi-dent, the Presidential election is un-derway—‘‘action on a Supreme Court nomination must be put off until after the election campaign is over.’’ Those are the words of J
OEBIDEN. Senator B
IDEN said that a temporary vacancy on the Court was ‘‘quite minor compared to the cost that a nominee, the President, the Senate, and our Na-tion would have to pay for what as-suredly would be a bitter fight.’’ That is what Senator B
IDEN at the time was worried about. He was wor-ried that a bitter fight over a nominee would do damage to the nominee and to the Senate. He knew there would be Senators who would come to the floor and try to politicize this process for their own purposes, and we are seeing the Democrats doing that right now. He knew it because that is what Demo-crats have done for years. This is politics as usual for the Democrats. It is the way they tend to live their lives here on the Senate floor—talking this way. It is exactly what Democrats did when Robert Bork was nominated to serve on the Su-preme Court. So Vice President B
IDEN, former Senator B
IDEN, understands it completely. It is what they did when Miguel Estrada was nominated to the circuit court. It is what Democrats did when Samuel Alito was nominated to the Supreme Court. Democrats in the Senate even filibustered Justice Alito when he was the nominee. They did ev-erything they could to slander good, qualified people to try to score polit-ical points. It is what they do.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S1403 March 10, 2016 
Well, there is no need for us to have this bitter political fight that J
OE B
IDEN worried about. Republicans have said there should not be a bitter polit-ical fight. We have called on the Presi-dent to spare the country this fight. The best way to avoid the fight is to agree to let the people decide. Give the people a voice, and let the next Presi-dent put forth the nomination. That is certainly what the people of Wyoming want us to do. It is what I heard, along with Senator E
NZI, on the telephone townhall meeting this past Monday, and that is what I heard as I traveled around the State of Wyoming the past several weekends. I will be back in Wy-oming this weekend, and I expect to hear the same thing as I travel to Buf-falo to the health fair and to commu-nities around the State. That is what the American people are saying: Give the people a voice. They are saying that a seat on the Supreme Court should not be just another polit-ical payoff to score points in an elec-tion year. They are saying it should not be a decision for a lameduck Presi-dent with one foot out the door. It is too important for that. The Supreme Court is functioning just fine with eight Justices right now. That is not me saying it; it is the Jus-tices of the Supreme Court saying the same thing. Since Justice Scalia died last month, the Court has heard oral arguments in 10 cases. They have re-leased written opinions in five cases. They have scheduled more cases for the rest of the term, and they are doing their jobs. That is exactly what Justice Breyer said they would do. He is a lib-eral Supreme Court Justice who was appointed by President Bill Clinton. A reporter asked Justice Breyer about the death of Justice Scalia, and he said: ‘‘We’ll miss him, but we’ll do our work.’’ He said: ‘‘For the most part, it will not change.’’ So there is no urgency to fill this va-cancy on the Supreme Court right now. There is no danger in waiting for the next President to act. There is tremen-dous danger, however, if we rush through a nomination in the last few months of a Presidential election, to the nominee, to the Senate, and to the Nation, just as J
OEBIDEN said 24 years ago. The stakes are very high, too high to let that happen. The people are telling us what they want. Eighty-eight percent of the peo-ple in Wyoming involved in our tele-phone townhall meeting on Monday said exactly that: Give the people a voice. We must let the people decide. Madam President, I yield the floor.

FILLING THE SUPREME COURT VACANCY  
Mr. WICKER. Madam President, I un-derstand we are on the bill, but there are no speakers presently here, so I would like to address the Chair and my colleagues for a few moments about the matter my colleague from Wyoming was discussing just now, and that is the very serious matter of how we will fill the vacancy of Justice Scalia. I want to read to my colleagues a message I got from one of my constitu-ents in Columbus, MS. As you can imagine, we have all received quite a bit of opinion from the people who put us in office, but I think this con-stituent really hits it on the head when she says: ‘‘The next appointment is probably the most crucial in our his-tory and will have ramifications on fu-ture generations.’’ I really agree with that, and I think it is such a profound decision that we ought to feel comfortable, as the Sen-ator from Wyoming just said, in letting the people decide. We are in the midst of a great debate about the direction our country will take, the executive branch will take, over the next 4 and possibly 8 years. The Court has been relatively bal-anced, with a slight 5–4 tilt toward the conservative side. Clearly there is an effort in this city and on the part of some of my friends on the other side of the aisle to shift that balance. I think it is reasonable to conclude, with so much involved and with the ramifica-tions on future generations, as my con-stituent has said, that it is very appro-priate that this be a matter of debate in this Presidential election and, frankly, in the Senate elections also. And I realize there is a lot of heat and light on this issue, but I would simply suggest that we are on the right track in letting the American people speak to this. There is another matter in this re-gard that I have been reluctant to bring to the attention of my colleagues until today, but I think it has gotten to the point where we need to be re-minded that there are rules of decorum that apply to this debate and to all de-bates we have on the Senate floor. I would direct the Chair’s attention and the attention of my colleagues to rule XIX of the Standing Rules of the Sen-ate. Paragraph 2 of that rule states: ‘‘No Senator in debate shall, directly or indirectly, by any form of words im-pute to another Senator or to other Senators any conduct or motive unwor-thy or unbecoming a Senator.’’ I read that paragraph in its entirety because it is quite obvious to me, to my colleagues on this side of the aisle, and I think to objective observers, that what has ensued over the last week or two has been a concerted effort to im-pugn the reputation and honor of the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, the distinguished Senator from Iowa, Mr. GRASSLEY . I would just suggest to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and particu-larly to my friend the distinguished minority leader that in reviewing some of the statements that have been made on this floor—and I have them in my hand, although I will not read them again to the Chair because they are in the R
ECORD —particularly those state-ments coming from the very top lead-ership of the other side of the aisle, there has been statement after state-ment that crosses the line, that is pro-hibited under the rules. It is a breach of our rules to suggest about any other Senator motives unworthy or unbe-coming of a Senator. I hope we can continue this debate, and certainly we will, but I hope we will confine it to the merits of the issue, and there are merits on both sides. This is not the place to conduct an election or reelection campaign— the floor of the Senate is not that place—and it seems to me that in re-cent days that line has been crossed and crossed repeatedly. I will get back to my original point. We are prepared to let the American people speak on this issue, and it is of vital importance not just for the next 4 years but perhaps for the next decade, two decades, or three decades. And I would ask us to dial the rhetoric back, dial the heat back, and stay on the issues. We are comfortable making the case that this is a decision that should be left to the American people. I thank the Chair for giving me the time. Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I want to take a few minutes to describe the funding that my substitute amend-ment for S. 524, the Comprehensive Ad-diction and Recovery Act of 2016, is in-tended to authorize. Section 202 of the amendment au-thorizes SAMHSA’s grants to prevent prescription drug/opioid overdose-re-lated deaths. These grants were appro-priated $12 million in H.R. 2029, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016. The specific appropriating lan-guage is located on page 50 of the De-partments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education report to H.R. 2029. Section 204 authorizes the COPS Anti-Heroin Task Force and Anti- Methamphetamine Task Force. These two task forces were appropriated $7 million each in H.R. 2029, for a total of $14 million. The specific appropriating language is located in paragraphs three and four under the section entitled ‘‘Community Oriented Policing Serv-ices’’, on page 70 of H.R. 2029. Section 301 authorizes SAMHSA’s grants for targeted capacity expan-sion—medicated assisted treatments.

Grants under this program were appro-priated $25 million in H.R. 2029. The specific appropriating language for this program is located in the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education report to H.R. 2029, on page 47. Section 501 authorizes SAMHSA’s Services Grant Program for Residen-tial Treatment for Pregnant & Postpartum Women. This grant pro-gram was appropriated $15.9 million in H.R. 2029. The specific appropriating language for this program is located in the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education report to H.R. 2029, on page 46. Finally, some of the other sections in CARA are being authorized through 42 U.S.C. section 3797cc, which was appro-priated $11 million in H.R. 2029. The specific appropriating language is lo-cated in paragraph one under the sec-tion entitled ‘‘Community Oriented Po-licing Services’’, on page 69 of H.R. 2029. Therefore, the managers’ amend-ment authorizes a total of $77.9 million in total. Mr. WICKER. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. COTTON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Congress finds the following: (1) The abuse of heroin and prescription opioid painkillers is having a devastating ef-fect on public health and safety in commu-nities across the United States. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-tion, drug overdose deaths now surpass traf-fic accidents in the number of deaths caused by injury in the United States. In 2014, an av-erage of more than 120 people in the United States died from drug overdoses every day. (2) According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse (commonly known as ‘‘NIDA’’), the number of prescriptions for opioids in-creased from approximately 76,000,000 in 1991 to nearly 207,000,000 in 2013, and the United States is the biggest consumer of opioids globally, accounting for almost 100 percent of the world total for hydrocodone and 81 percent for oxycodone. (3) Opioid pain relievers are the most wide-ly misused or abused controlled prescription drugs (commonly referred to as ‘‘CPDs’’) and are involved in most CPD-related overdose incidents. According to the Drug Abuse Warning Network (commonly known as ‘‘DAWN’’), the estimated number of emer-gency department visits involving nonmed-ical use of prescription opiates or opioids in-creased by 112 percent between 2006 and 2010, from 84,671 to 179,787. (4) The use of heroin in the United States has also spiked sharply in recent years. Ac-cording to the most recent National Survey on Drug Use and Health, more than 900,000 people in the United States reported using heroin in 2014, nearly a 35 percent increase from the previous year. Heroin overdose deaths more than tripled from 2010 to 2014. (5) The supply of cheap heroin available in the United States has increased dramatically as well, largely due to the activity of Mexi-can drug trafficking organizations. The Drug Enforcement Administration (commonly known as the ‘‘DEA’’) estimates that heroin seizures at the Mexican border have more than doubled since 2010, and heroin produc-tion in Mexico increased 62 percent from 2013 to 2014. While only 8 percent of State and local law enforcement officials across the United States identified heroin as the great-est drug threat in their area in 2008, that number rose to 38 percent in 2015.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S1405 March 10, 2016 
(6) Law enforcement officials and treat-ment experts throughout the country report that many people who have misused pre-scription opioids have turned to heroin as a cheaper or more easily obtained alternative to prescription opioids. (7) According to a report by the National Association of State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Directors (commonly referred to as ‘‘NASADAD’’), 37 States reported an increase in admissions to treatment for heroin use during the past 2 years, while admissions to treatment for prescription opiates increased 500 percent from 2000 to 2012. (8) Research indicates that combating the opioid crisis, including abuse of prescription painkillers and, increasingly, heroin, re-quires a multipronged approach that in-volves prevention, education, monitoring, law enforcement initiatives, reducing drug diversion and the supply of illicit drugs, ex-panding delivery of existing treatments (in-cluding medication assisted treatments), ex-panding access to overdose medications and interventions, and the development of new medications for pain that can augment the existing treatment arsenal. (9) Substance use disorders are a treatable disease. Discoveries in the science of addic-tion have led to advances in the treatment of substance use disorders that help people stop abusing drugs and prescription medications and resume their productive lives. (10) According to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, approximately 22,700,000 people in the United States needed substance use disorder treatment in 2013, but only 2,500,000 people received it. Further-more, current treatment services are not adequate to meet demand. According to a re-port commissioned by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (commonly known as ‘‘SAMHSA’’), there are approximately 32 providers for every 1,000 in-dividuals needing substance use disorder treatment. In some States, the ratio is much lower. (11) The overall cost of drug abuse, from health care- and criminal justice-related costs to lost productivity, is steep, totaling more than $700,000,000,000 a year, according to NIDA. Effective substance abuse preven-tion can yield major economic dividends. (12) According to NIDA, when schools and communities properly implement science- validated substance abuse prevention pro-grams, abuse of alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs is reduced. Such programs help teach-ers, parents, and healthcare professionals shape the perceptions of youths about the risks of drug abuse. (13) Diverting certain individuals with sub-stance use disorders from criminal justice systems into community-based treatment can save billions of dollars and prevent size-able numbers of crimes, arrests, and re-in-carcerations over the course of those individ-uals’ lives. (14) According to the DEA, more than 2,700 tons of expired, unwanted prescription medi-cations have been collected since the enact-ment of the Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act of 2010 (Public Law 111–273; 124 Stat. 2858). (15) Faith-based, holistic, or drug-free mod-els can provide a critical path to successful recovery for a number of people in the United States. The 2015 membership survey conducted by Alcoholics Anonymous (com-monly known as ‘‘AA’’) found that 73 percent of AA members were sober longer than 1 year and attended 2.5 meetings per week. (16) Research shows that combining treat-ment medications with behavioral therapy is an effective way to facilitate success for some patients. Treatment approaches must be tailored to address the drug abuse pat-terns and drug-related medical, psychiatric, and social problems of each individual. Dif-ferent types of medications may be useful at different stages of treatment or recovery to help a patient stop using drugs, stay in treatment, and avoid relapse. Patients have a range of options regarding their path to re-covery and many have also successfully ad-dressed drug abuse through the use of faith- based, holistic, or drug-free models. (17) Individuals with mental illness, espe-cially severe mental illness, are at consider-ably higher risk for substance abuse than the general population, and the presence of a mental illness complicates recovery from substance abuse. (18) Rural communities are especially sus-ceptible to heroin and opioid abuse. Individ-uals in rural counties have higher rates of drug poisoning deaths, including deaths from opioids. According to the American Journal of Public Health, ‘‘[O]pioid poisonings in nonmetropolitan counties have increased at a rate greater than threefold the increase in metropolitan counties.’’ According to a Feb-ruary 19, 2016, report from the Maine Rural Health Research Center, ‘‘[M]ultiple studies document a higher prevalence [of abuse] among specific vulnerable rural populations, particularly among youth, women who are pregnant or experiencing partner violence, and persons with co-occurring disorders.’’

SENATE ACCOMPLISHMENTS Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, as many Iowans know, I made a prac-tice of holding townhall meetings in each of the 99 counties of my State every year. It has become known in the media as a ‘‘Full Grassley.’’ That is not something I named it. That is some-thing someone else named it. It is kind of a flattering name, but in some ways it does not make sense because the townhalls are not about Senator G
RASSLEY . They are about hearing from Iowans whom I am proud to serve. They are about hearing about the real problems my constituents have, and, of course, from our end, trying to find practical solutions to those problems. That is what I work on every day. I suppose all of my colleagues would say that is what they work on every day. On many occasions at my townhall meetings in recent years, Iowans have asked me why the Senate never gets anything done. Both parties probably shoulder some of the blame for this at-titude out there at the grassroots, but the reality is that the most obvious, the most glaring, the most unmistak-able reason for the Senate’s recent pa-ralysis is the way Democratic Leader R
EIDran it before he was toppled as majority leader. When the Democratic leader was in control of the Senate, he was the one who decided not to empower his com-mittee chairs to craft and advance bi-partisan legislation. He decided not to

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S1417 March 10, 2016 
give all Members, Republican and Democratic alike, a real opportunity to participate in the process. He decided not to empower the Senate to address real problems that real people face every day. Instead, he chose dysfunction and gridlock over practicality and problem solving. By November 2014, the Amer-ican people had finally had enough. After the American people spoke, the Democratic leader no longer controlled the Senate. Since the Senate has been under Republican leadership, things have started to work again. You see it in the latest example of this bill pass-ing almost unanimously. So this is an example of Senators partnering across the aisle. Legislation is moving. The result is real progress on real issues facing our country. I am proud the Judiciary Committee has played its part. As chairman, my goal has been to open the process and seek as much consensus as possible. The results reflect that. We have re-ported 21 bills out of committee, all with bipartisan support. I would like to walk through some of these results be-cause there is a lot of credit to go around on both sides of the aisle. Last February the committee passed the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act. We passed it unanimously, 19 to 0. The bill enhances penalties for human trafficking and equips law enforcement with new tools to target predators who traffic in innocent young people. The bill passed the Senate 99 to 0 and was passed into law. Yes, there were some bumps along the way. When the Democratic leader realized that genuine bipartisanship had broken out and that we might ac-tually accomplish something, a con-troversy had to be manufactured about the Hyde amendment on that par-ticular trafficking bill, but eventually the Democratic leader took yes for an answer and the bill got done. This victory was a credit to the lead-ership of one Democrat and one Repub-lican—Senator C
ORNYN and Senator K
LOBUCHAR . Their bill provided real so-lutions for real victims of trafficking. A few months later, in October, the committee passed the Sentencing Re-form and Corrections Act. Sentencing reform is a difficult and complex issue. Many Senators have strongly held views. Despite that, the bill emerged from our committee with a strong 15- to-5 bipartisanship vote. My bill would recalibrate prison sentences for certain drug offenders, target violent crimi-nals, and grant judges greater discre-tion at sentencing for low-level, non-violent drug crimes. I am grateful for the Senators who have partnered with me on this legislation, especially Sen-ators D
URBIN , C ORNYN , W HITEHOUSE , and L
EE. I am hopeful that if we keep working together, landmark sen-tencing reform can be another major accomplishment of this Senate. Time is growing short, but I cannot think of a more productive use of the Senate’s time than to make our criminal laws more just. This is another example of a real problem we can solve together. Also, in July of last year, the com-mittee passed my Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Reauthoriza-tion Act, again, without opposition. The bill will ensure that at-risk youth are fairly and effectively served by ju-venile justice grant programs. These important programs provide the chance for kids to get back on the right track so they will not enter the criminal jus-tice system as adults. Every one of these young people are worth helping to reach their greatest potential. Sen-ator WHITEHOUSE , a Democrat from Rhode Island, and I are working hard to move this bill through the full Sen-ate. I thank him for working with me on it. There are many other bipartisan ac-complishments of this Senate that the Judiciary Committee cannot take cred-it for. I will not try to go through all of them, of course, but one example that comes to mind was the out-standing work of Senator B
URR, a Re-publican, Senator F
EINSTEIN , a Demo-crat, on the cyber security bill. That legislation passed the Senate on a solid 74-to-21 vote. A conference version of it was later signed into law by the Presi-dent. With reports of breaches of our personal data on an almost daily basis, it is self-evident that this bill helped to address a real problem that has af-fected millions of Americans. That brings me to the Senate’s pas-sage of the bill that was just voted on, the Comprehensive Addiction and Re-covery Act—CARA, for short. It passed today with an overwhelming bipartisan vote. This legislation reflects the Sen-ate at its finest, working in a bipar-tisan way to address an awful epidemic that is gripping our country. I thank the authors of CARA for their leadership in crafting the legisla-tion and working with me to move it through the Judiciary Committee and out of that committee unanimously. In particular, I thank Senators P
ORTMAN , A
YOTTE , WHITEHOUSE , and K LOBUCHAR ; you see, two Democrats and two Re-publicans. Real lives will be saved be-cause of the leadership of this bipar-tisan group. That is not something we can say every day around the Senate. I know the efforts of those Senators and others to address this epidemic stretch back a few years. It is a shame the Democratic leader decided not to address this crisis at the early stage when he was deciding the agenda of the Senate, but he decided not to act, even in the face of mount-ing evidence that the country was fac-ing a grave and gathering epidemic of heroin and opioid painkiller overdoses. Deaths from prescription opioid pain-killers rose over 30 percent from 2007 to 2014. Heroin overdose deaths more than quadrupled during that time. Heroin seizures at the southwest border more than quadrupled as well. All the while, the Democratic leader never brought a bill to the floor to address the crisis. So given the dysfunction that had overtaken the Senate not long ago, we should take a moment to appreciate the bipartisan process through which the Senate just passed this CARA bill. As the Republican chairman of the Ju-diciary Committee, I moved a Demo-cratic bill through the committee. It passed without opposition. Then the Republican leader promptly scheduled the bill for floor consideration. I don’t recall that ever happening under the former Democratic leadership. The Senate had rollcall votes on four amendments, although the Republican leader offered more such votes on Democratic amendments. All four of those amendments were offered by Democratic Senators, and the bill passed overwhelmingly, as amended. This process would have been unthink-able under the Democratic leader. This simply would not have happened. You know the statistics. There were 18 roll-call votes on amendments all during the year 2014. During 2015, we had 198 rollcall votes on amendments and only 4 more Republican amendments than Democratic amendments. Yes, once again the Democratic lead-er tried to manufacture a controversy when this bill first came to the floor about a week ago Monday, this time over some alleged funding for this her-oin-opioid epidemic. But when $400 mil-lion in newly appropriated money for it hasn’t even been spent yet, well, that argument by the Democratic leader was a tough one to sell. Over the last few days, the Demo-cratic leader played some games with negotiations on a managers’ package of amendments. The Republican side, the majority side, worked hard to clear amendments offered by many Demo-crats, including Senators DURBIN , G
ILLIBRAND , HEINRICH , KAINE, M CCAS-
KILL, BLUMENTHAL , SCHATZ , HEITKAMP , and C
ARDIN , but the Democratic leader objected to completely uncontrover-sial, commonsense amendments that would be in the package offered by two Republicans, Senator J
OHNSON and Senator K
IRK. Why? Simply because these Republican Senators are up for reelection this year, and under those circumstances, we couldn’t reach an agreement. So all these Democratic amendments didn’t go because the Democratic leader had objection to two Republican, relatively noncontrover-sial amendments, one of them abso-lutely noncontroversial. How noncontroversial were these amendments? Let me give you one ex-ample. Senator J
OHNSON wanted to add the Indian Health Service as a member of the task force the bill creates to de-velop best prescribing practices for opioids. I suspect many Americans, in-cluding even people living in the State of Nevada, would think Senator J
OHN-
SON’s idea is a good one. Addiction is a problem for so many in our country, and the Native American community is unfortunately no exception. But this is the kind of dysfunction, the kind of gridlock that the Democratic leader is known for. A good idea becomes a bad idea if it is simply offered by a Member

of the Republican Party, and that espe-cially is the case if you are a Repub-lican up for reelection. As CARA’s name reflects, the bill ad-dresses this epidemic comprehensively, supporting prevention, education, treatment, recovery, and law enforce-ment. CARA begins with prevention and education. The bill authorizes awareness and education campaigns so that the public understands the dan-gers of becoming addicted. It also cre-ates a national task force to develop best prescribing practices, as I men-tioned. The bill encourages the use of prescription drug monitoring pro-grams, such as those in my State of Iowa, which help to detect and deter what is called doctor shopping behav-iors by addicts. The bill authorizes an expansion of the Federal program that allows patients to safely dispose of old or unused medications so that these drugs don’t fall into the hands of young people. In fact, along with a few other committee members, I helped start the original take-back program in 2010 through the Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act. CARA also focuses on treatment and recovery. The bill authorizes programs to provide first responders with train-ing to use naloxone, a drug that can re-verse the effects of an opioid overdose and directly save lives. Critically, the bill provides that a set portion of naloxone funding go to rural areas, like much of Iowa, which are being affected most acutely. This is critical when someone overdoses and isn’t near a hospital. The bill also authorizes an expansion of Drug-Free Communities Act grants to those areas that are most dramati-cally affected by the opioid epidemic. And it also authorizes funds for pro-grams that encourage the use of medi-cation-assisted treatment, provide community-based support for those in recovery, and address the unique needs of pregnant and postpartum women who are addicted to opioids. Finally, the bill also bolsters law en-forcement efforts as well. The bill re-authorizes Federal funding for State task forces that specifically address heroin trafficking. So in all these ways, CARA will help real people address the very real epi-demic. The eastern part of my State has been hit the hardest. The human costs of what is happening across so many of these communities is incalcu-lable. Every life that is lost or changed forever by this crisis is precious, espe-cially for many young people who fall victim to addiction early in their lives. There is so much human potential at stake.

REMEMBERING DR. MIGUEL ENCINIAS Mr. UDALL. Madam President, I rise today to remember a great New Mexi-can and a great American, Dr. Miguel Encinias, who passed away on Satur-day, February 20, at the age of 92. New Mexico has a long and proud tra-dition of military service. Dr. Encinias is often called ‘‘New Mexico’s most decorated veteran.’’ He fought in three wars and was the recipient of 3 Distin-guished Flying Crosses, 14 Air Medals, and 2 Purple Hearts. His military ca-reer is one of courage and sacrifice. He later played an important role in the creation of the World War II Memorial here in Washington, DC. If the measure of a life is living to the utmost of one’s talents and giving the utmost of one’s self, Miguel Encinias is an inspiration to all of us. I think that is why he will long be re-membered with such admiration and gratitude. His service began at the young age of 16 when he joined the New Mexico Na-tional Guard in 1939. Within 4 years, he had become a second lieutenant and a pilot in the Army Air Corps. Over the next three decades he fought with dis-tinction in three wars: World War II, the Korean war, and Vietnam. As his friend and mine, Ralph Arellanes, who is chairman of the Hispano Roundtable of New Mexico, said of Miguel: Miguel flew 245 combat missions as a fighter pilot. Few Amer-ican aviators in history have flown combat missions in three wars. Miguel was one of them. He was shot down over Italy in 1944 and served over 15 months in a Nazi prison camp. He volunteered to go to Korea and was shot down again but not captured. He answered the call of his country many times with great cour-age and sacrifice. Dr. Encinias retired as a lieutenant colonel in 1971, but if that was the con-clusion of his storied military career, it was just the beginning of new accom-plishments and new achievements. He returned to New Mexico and earned a doctorate in Hispanic literature at the University of New Mexico. In an article about his life, the Albu-querque Journal said: ‘‘As a scholar, educator, New Mexico historian, and decorated combat flyer in three wars, Miguel Encinias both studied and shaped history in a life that spanned nine decades.’’ There was an article about Miguel in the Santa Fe New Mexican, and they put it this way: ‘‘An ace in the air, a scholar on the ground.’’ He earlier obtained a degree in polit-ical science at Georgetown University and a master’s degree at the Institute of Political Studies in Paris. In 1995 he was requested by President Clinton to serve on the World War II Memorial Advisory Board. By the time the memorial was built in 2004, Dr. Encinias was the only living member of the board to see it completed. It was a happy day for him. In an interview with the Albuquerque Journal, Dr. Encinias’s son, Juan- Pablo Encinias, summed up what so many who knew Dr. Encinias under-stood: ‘‘It’s kind of amazing how much he accomplished,’’ his son said. ‘‘He really didn’t stop.’’ Those accomplishments, according to the Journal, included teaching His-panic literature at two universities and developing bilingual education in New Mexico schools. Dr. Encinias also found the time to write several books on New Mexico his-tory and to fund a theater group and a light opera company in Albuquerque. His son Juan-Pablo also remarked to the Journal that Dr. Encinias ‘‘was very just and felt very strongly about people getting their fair shake in life.’’ Dr. Encinias was honored for his work for civil rights and social justice by the New Mexico LULAC branch in 2007 and the Hispano Roundtable of New Mexico in 2011. As important as the medals and honors are, they aren’t the most important thing we will re-member about Dr. Encinias. It is the example he set in always doing his best, in always giving back, both in wartime and at home. His daughter Isabel shared with me that although her father had incredibly high standards and was very tough, he had an incredible amount of compas-sion and always fought for the under-dog. Whether risking his own life to save that of his fellow airmen or fighting for quality education and opportunity for everyone, Miguel Encinias committed himself to the needs of others. On November 11, 1995, at the World War II Memorial site dedication, Dr. Encinias was introduced by the chair-man of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He re-ceived a standing ovation from Presi-dent Clinton and everyone present. They knew they were seeing a true pa-triot and a true hero and a great Amer-ican. On that day, President Clinton thanked Dr. Encinias and said for ‘‘your truly remarkable service to our nation.’’ To all who knew this extraordinary man and who mourn him now, we know his life was indeed a remarkable story of courage, of dedication, and of gen-erosity of spirit. Madam President, my State has lost one of its heroes. Over the course of a

long and distinguished life, Dr. Miguel Encinias always found ways to serve, and New Mexico and our Nation are better for it. My wife Jill and I extend our sincere condolences to the Encinias family on the passing of Dr. Encinias. We honor his courage, we honor his service, and we mourn his loss with the family. Thank you very much. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CORKER.

SALE OF FIGHTER JETS TO PAKISTAN Mr. CORKER. Madam President, I rise to speak about the discharge vote that will take place momentarily. I just want to say that I know that many people in our country and cer-tainly in this body have significant frustrations with the country of Paki-stan. This Senator is one of those. I have been to Afghanistan multiple times. I have visited Pakistan multiple times. Our relationship is one that is very complex. Certainly, Pakistan has been duplicitous in many ways with us relative to their relationship with the Taliban and with Al Qaeda and, cer-tainly and most importantly, as it re-lates to this particular topic, the Haqqani network. Our country has worked with them to clear out the FATA areas, the Feder-ally Administered Tribal Areas. I think most of us have seen the work that has taken place there, and they have worked with us closely in that regard. There still are issues undoubtedly that exist relative to their relationship with the Haqqani network, in par-ticular, but also the Taliban. At the same time, there are negotiations that are underway that are very important to create a lasting peace in Afghani-stan. Even though they play both sides of the fence—and I understand that— and even though we have concerns about their relationship with the Haqqani network, they do play a role relative to how those negotiations are taking place. I have issues with them. I think ev-eryone in the country of Pakistan by this point knows that I have issues with them, at least those who are pay-ing attention to this issue. What this discharge petition is about today is that it is voting to discharge something to the Senate floor so that there can be a vote on ending the al-lowance of a sale of some fighter jets. These will be U.S.-made fighter jets. In spite of some of the rhetoric around this, this has nothing to do with the potential subsidy that could take place by U.S. taxpayers. This is about one thing. It is about whether we as a country would prefer for Pakistan to buy American-made fighter jets or whether we would prefer for them to buy Russian jets or French jets. This is what this is about. There are some issues that people have raised about potential subsidies for this. I know Senator CARDIN , who is on the floor right now, and myself both have a hold on that—a hold to ensure that there is some behavior changes that take place in Pakistan before any U.S. dollars go toward this sale. But this vote is not about that. This vote is a vote about whether we believe that countries around the world are better off buying U.S. made materials or whether we think they should buy them from Russia or France. That is what this is about in its entirety. We are seeking some behavior changes with Pakistan relative to how they are dealing with the Taliban, with how they are dealing with the Haqqani network. It is something that General Campbell, who has been in charge of Afghanistan from a military stand-point, has pushed for. We are working closely with our military and others to try to effect the behavior changes that are necessary for us to have an appro-priate response in Afghanistan—but this is a foreign policy issue. Again, everyone in this body, thank-fully, is very concerned about our for-eign policy. Foreign policy, I might say, sometimes has to have a degree of nuance to it. We are working with peo-ple and with relationships that matter. It matters deeply to the people who we have on the ground, the men and women in uniform in Afghanistan and other places. Our efforts around foreign policy are to do everything we can to ensure we are not utilizing men and women in uniform to solve a problem, because that happens when diplomacy fails. So this is a very nuanced topic, and I can just say that the Senate deciding en bloc to block a sale to Pakistan of U.S.-made fighter jets is going to be a huge public embarrassment to the country of Pakistan, and there are bet-ter ways, in my opinion, for solving this problem. All of us want to see the behavior change, and I am privileged to be in a position to have some effect on the financing, as does Senator C
ARDIN , and we can deal with this issue in a more nuanced way. I know some people will say that this is a great thing for back home. Our people back home will love this. Sure-ly, surely, in this body when it comes to dealing with a country with nuclear arms and dealing with Afghanistan, where we have been for 14 years, how we deal with foreign policy will rise above just the immediate response and maybe misunderstandings even that people back home can have about this type of issue. This relationship with Pakistan needs to move beyond the trans-actional way that it is carried out. I understand that. I understand that peo-ple are frustrated. But at the end of the day, our goal here as representatives of the United States is to see through good things happening for our country. That is what foreign policy is about. It is about pursuing our national inter-ests. It is my strong belief that the Sen-ate’s voting today, in essence, to begin the process of denying Pakistan the ability to purchase U.S. fighter jets is not a way to engender things that are good for our own U.S. national inter-ests. A better way is for us to continue to put pressure on them as we are doing at present, placing holds on fi-nancing until they do some things to change their behavior and work with us more fully relative to the Haqqani network, in particular, but also Al Qaeda and the Taliban. So I would urge my fellow citizens and fellow Senators to please think about the long-term interests of our country, to think about when a coun-try is radicalized and has so many problems as the country of Pakistan has, the public embarrassment that will take place by our body doing this. Let’s work together in other ways that actually can generate behavior change by dealing with this in a more subtle way than this blunt object that we are dealing with today. I want to close with this—and I know Senator CARDIN wants to speak, and I know he has a meeting to go to. What we are voting on, if we discharge this, is that we are voting on whether we would rather for Pakistan to purchase U.S.-made fighter jets, which carry with that at least 30 years of mainte-nance, meaning that every single year the United States would be involved with these fighter jets. We could with-draw that at any time if we thought their behavior continued to be such that we didn’t want to support it. It can stop. It maintains our leverage with Pakistan over the longer haul. That is what our selling them these pieces of equipment does. It maintains our leverage over them. Today, publicly embarrassing them and sending them to Russia or to France to buy fighter jets ends that le-verage and humiliates them at a time when, in spite of the fact that we don’t like some of the things they do, it in essence damages our ability to con-tinue the negotiations that are taking place relative to trying to bring a more lasting peace in Afghanistan. I thank you for the time, Madam President. I yield the floor for my good friend and ranking member on the For-eign Relations Committee, Senator C
ARDIN . The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Maryland. Mr. CARDIN. Thank you, Madam President. I want to thank Senator C

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES1420 March 10, 2016 
the Senate Foreign Relations Com-mittee on this issue and on many other issues. Let me first try to explain what we believe will happen in the next 45 min-utes. Under the Arms Export Control Act, the sale of military armament to Pakistan requires the administration to give formal notification to the Con-gress. Prior to that formal notifica-tion, there is an informal process where the administration will inform the Senate Foreign Relations Com-mittee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee that they intend to make a sale. They did that in regard to the F– 16s for Pakistan, and that is the issue we are talking about. For several months we have been in negotiations with the administration— as well as with stakeholders with re-gard to the sale of the F–16 to Paki-stan—because quite frankly we did have concerns. We had concerns as to how it would impact the region, includ-ing India. We had concerns about Paki-stan being a nuclear weapons state. We had concerns about Pakistan’s efforts for counterinsurgency. We had con-cerns about Pakistan’s participation in the peace process with Afghanistan. All of those are issues we were able to get some discussions on and we think some progress to the F–16 sale. The administration formally notified Congress of the F–16 sale on February 25. At that time the bipartisan leader-ship of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Foreign Af-fairs Committee had agreed the admin-istration should go forward with the sale. What we think will happen under the Arms Export Control Act—and any Member can offer a resolution of dis-approval—is that Senator P
AULwill be offering to bring up a resolution of this approval. We think that will take place in about 45 minutes. It is likely it will require a motion to proceed or to bring the motion forward, and it is possible the leader, the Republican leader, the majority leader, may offer a motion to table in regard to that motion. I urge my colleagues to understand the next vote will be whether we are going to take up—or not—the resolu-tion of disapproval. Senator C
ORKER and I both urge our colleagues that this resolution not be approved, not be taken up; that we allow the sale to go forward but that we maintain our leverage, as Senator C
ORKER has explained, because there are many more issues involved before the sale becomes complete. Quite frankly, the reason the F–16s are being recommended is because Pakistan needs the F–16s for their fight against counterinsurgency. I think all of my colleagues are aware of the mountainous terrain, territory that is in Pakistan on the Afghan border. Pakistan needs an air force capacity to deal with that counterinsurgency. It is our military’s judgment that these F–16s are important in regard to that fight against counterinsurgency; that it is in our interests, U.S. inter-ests; that it is in the regional interests, including the stability of its neighbor, India; and it is in the interests of deal-ing with the fight against the extrem-ists. As I said earlier, the relationship with Pakistan is complicated. We have several areas of major concern in that relationship, and we fully understand the reasons Members would be con-cerned. We are a strategic partner with Pakistan in rooting out terrorism. Let me remind my colleagues, the people of Pakistan have had 40,000 deaths as a re-sult of extremist activities within their borders. That is an incredible sacrifice that has been made in their campaign against terrorists, against extremists. They have the Haqqani network, which we know has taken out American in-terests in that region, they had the fight against ISIS, and they had the fight against LeT, which is a terrorist organization within Pakistan that has committed terrorist attacks in India. We want them to focus on all of these extremists. At times we don’t get the full cooperation of Pakistan for these to be the priorities they go after. Obvi-ously, we want to continue our part-nership with Pakistan, but we want them to deal with the threat of the Haqqani network. We want them to focus on the threats of ISIS. We want them to concentrate on the desta-bilizing impact that LeT has on the re-lationship between Pakistan, India, and the cause of problems in India. We want to see more progress. On the second front, on the nuclear phase, Pakistan is the fastest growing nuclear stockpile in the world. Our re-lationship with Pakistan is critically important for the certainty, safety, and security of the command and con-trol network of their nuclear arsenal. Are they doing everything we want them to do in that regard? No. Have we made significant progress in the safety of their nuclear stockpile? Yes. Do we want to continue our relationship so we can continue to make progress? Ab-solutely. The third area we need Pakistan’s co-operation is in bringing together all the stakeholders for a peaceful discus-sion of the peace talks in Afghanistan. The extreme elements that are located in Pakistan need to be part of those discussions. Pakistan can play a crit-ical role in helping that come about. Has Pakistan been helpful? Quite frankly, they have. They have been working with us to get all the stake-holders together in the talks. Could they do more? Yes, we think they could do more. What Chairman C
ORKER said is abso-lutely accurate. We would encourage our colleagues to vote against the reso-lution of disapproval or to support our efforts to keep that off the floor, first and foremost because the F–16 are needed by Afghanistan and U.S. inter-ests to fight the extremists, but just as important, it maintains the ability of the United States to deal with Paki-stan to bring about further progress in all the areas I have talked about. As the chairman said, the worst-case sce-nario is that we break our relationship with Pakistan and other countries step in, and our ability to get changes in Pakistan’s practices as they relate to support or fighting terrorist organiza-tions or nuclear nonproliferation and participation in the Afghan peace talks could be marginalized. In order to maintain the type of bi-partisan, bilateral pressure on the problematic elements of the security sector, but while supporting reformers in the military and civilian govern-ments, we urge our colleagues that it is important we take this sale to the next level. The last point—and Chairman CORKER pointed this out—we are not signing off on the foreign military fi-nancing part. The administration has brought forward a proposal for some re-programming of funds to help pay for the F–16 sale to Pakistan. In other words, we would use some of the mon-eys we have already programmed for Afghanistan to be used to pay for the sale of the F–16s. That requires a signoff from the leadership of the two authorizing committees. Senator C
ORKER and I had not signed off on that—nor do we intend to sign off on that until we have further explanations on a lot of the issues Senator C
ORKER  and I have already raised. We have ample ways of dealing with our bilat-eral relationship with Pakistan, allow-ing the sale formally to go forward by how the sale will be financed. For all those reasons, I urge my col-leagues to oppose Senator P
AUL’s reso-lution and allow us to continue the dip-lomatic path in regard to that region. With that, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. E
RNST ). The Senator from Connecticut. Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, I thank Senator C
ARDIN and Senator C
ORKER for how diligently they have worked over the course of the last sev-eral months, as both of them have stat-ed on the floor, to make this sale much more palatable and to address many of the concerns that both the chairman and the ranking member had about the nature of the sale and this long history of conflict with the Pakistanis when it comes to our mutual concern of con-fronting terrorism. The reason I come to the floor is be-cause this body historically has had a history of deep engagement on ques-tions of major arms sales, especially in regions as dangerous and as com-plicated as the Middle East. As it stands today, virtually the only two Members who are deeply and meaning-fully engaged in the question of attach-ing conditions to these very important arms sales are the ranking member and the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. I trust their ability to hold the administration’s feet to the fire— whether it be the Pakistanis’, the Saudis’, the Emirates’ feet to the fire as they request weapons from the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S1421 March 10, 2016 
United States, but this body writ large has to get back into the game of pro-viding meaningful oversight on a rad-ical and significant increase in the amount of arms sales the United States is providing to the rest of the world. From 2011 to 2015, our arms exports have increased by 27 percent. When you compare these two periods, it is strik-ing to note that during that period of time our arms sales to the Middle East have increased by 61 percent. This Senate has, at its best moments, raised important questions about these sales. I bring you back to the 1980s, when the Senate raised important questions and concerns about the sale of AWACS to Saudi Arabia. On this side of the aisle, it was Senator B
IDEN and Senator Kerry opposing those sales. Those motions of disapproval were ultimately unsuccessful, but through that process of deep congres-sional introspection, new conditions were placed on the sale of that tech-nology to the Saudis that ended up a much better and safer deal for Amer-ican national security interests and for the security of our partners in the re-gion. With respect to the specific sale of F– 16 to Pakistan, my colleagues have al-ready pointed out—and I think Senator P
AUL will do a better job than I of pointing out—the ways in which our aims of fighting terrorism have been contradictory with the actions of the Pakistanis, whether it be their unwill-ingness to confront the Haqqani net-work, whether it be their oftentimes open coordination with elements of the Taliban that the United States is fight-ing inside Afghanistan. The Pakistanis have been an unreliable partner over the course of the last 10 years in the fight against extremism, but what I worry more about is that these F–16s will provide cover, will provide a sub-stitute for truly meaningful action in-side Pakistan to take on the roots of extremism. Frankly, it is too late in many respects to beat these extremist groups if they are so big, so powerful, so deadly that you have to bomb them from the air. Today there are 20,000 madrassa, reli-gious schools. Many, if not most, are funded by the Saudis, the Gulf States, and the Iranians and are often preach-ing an intolerant version of Islam that when perverted, forms the basis of the extremist groups the United States is fighting in the Middle East and throughout the world. The Pakistanis have done little to nothing to try to reduce the influence of those madrassas, of those religious schools, and of the foreign funding that often breeds this intolerant version of religious teaching. In a sense, we let them off the hook by selling them new weapons systems that will, in effect, constantly force the Pakistanis to chase their own tail. I think it is important to understand that the Pakistanis are not making the real meaningful contributions to root-ing out extremism, and just handing out weapon systems on the back end doesn’t do the job. I would point this body to the path forward. This is an incredibly impor-tant conversation that we are having with respect to the F–16s, but we have other pending military sales that will directly involve the United States in regional civil wars and conflicts, unbe-knownst often to the American people. One of them is a major military sales agreement with the Saudis that would eventually resupply them for their bombing campaign in Yemen, a cam-paign that has killed hundreds of thou-sands of civilians, that has stopped emergency relief from reaching those who have been the victims of this hu-manitarian disaster, and frankly that has created space for the expansion of ISIS and Al Qaeda, groups that want to do damage and attack the United States, inside the newly ungovernable territory of Yemen. Yet we are going to be confronted with another military sale to Saudi Arabia that would double down the U.S. commitment on one side of a civil war that if you look at the re-ality, doesn’t seem to be advancing our national security interests. It doesn’t seem to be helping us win the fight against ISIS and Al Qaeda. I hope that after the break we will have the opportunity to discuss that military sale as well because it is time for Congress to get back into the game when it comes to our constitutional re-sponsibility to oversee the foreign pol-icy led by the executive branch. It is time for Congress to start having a meaningful impact when it comes to these massive arms sales that often un-dermine U.S. national security and come without the necessary conditions to change the reality of the decisions made in places such as Pakistan. I am going to support Senator P
AUL’s resolution today, although I hope in the future we will approach these reso-lutions of disapproval with a slightly greater degree of subtlety in this re-spect. This is an outright disapproval. If we vote in favor of it, this sale will not go forward. There is another way. Congress could pass a motion of dis-approval with conditions. We could dis-approve of a sale to Pakistan pending, for instance, their commitment to join the fight against the Haqqani network; contingent upon, for instance, their movement to implement a law to shut down the worst and most intolerant of the madrasas. I would suggest that should be our path forward when it comes to the sale to the Saudis. Simple conditions could be applied to that res-olution—making sure the munitions we are selling to the Saudis aren’t used to target civilians inside Yemen; commit-ting the Saudis to open up pathways of humanitarian relief and assistance; a promise that none of the funding from the United States to the partners in the coalition to fight the Houthis will be used to directly aid extremist groups. That is probably the better path forward for this body to take. This is a very blunt instrument, a resolution of disapproval. I think it is important for some of us to be on record supporting it to show that Con-gress is getting back in the game when it comes to overseeing this fairly sub-stantial increase in arms sales to our named partners in the Middle East, but I think there is a better way forward. I hope that Senator PAULand others, as we start to go about doing due dili-gence on future sales, will take a look at maybe a more meaningful contribu-tion this body can take rather than ex-pressing our outright unconditional disapproval. How can we make sure, if these arms sales go forward, that they go forward with conditions attached that are in the best interest of the United States and our partner nations? Again, I thank Senators C
ORKER and C
ARDIN for their important work in the Foreign Relations Committee, of which I am a member, and I thank Senator P
AUL for having the courage to bring this resolution to the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Virginia. Mr. WARNER. Madam President, let me first of all thank my colleague from the State of Connecticut for his com-ments. I, too, will be joining him and others in supporting the resolution to be brought forward in some moments by Senator P
AUL. I, too, agree that this is a rather blunt instrument. A more strategic use of bringing some leverage to this kind of action would be a more appropriate path, and I hope that in fu-ture times, when we have a chance to review foreign arms sales, we will take that more nuanced approach. Madam President, while I approve of much of what the Senator from Con-necticut has said, I want to speak to this issue from a slightly different per-spective, and that is the message that at least inadvertently we will be send-ing with approval of the sale of these jets. And let me again commend Sen-ator C
ORKER and Senator C ARDIN for appropriately looking at the issue of public financing of these sales. If we move forward with these sales without putting some markers down, I think we potentially not only do damage to holding Pakistan’s feet to the fire in terms of the threat of terrorists in Af-ghanistan and elsewhere in the region but also potentially do damage to one of the most important relationships our country has, and that is the stra-tegic relationship between the United States and India. This relationship has been one of enormous, growing impor-tance. India has been a valuable and strategic partner of the United States and is a tremendous ally in promoting global peace and security. That has not always been the case. Relations be-tween our two nations have been stead-ily improving over the past decade, ranging from approval on the Civilian Nuclear Agreement, to frequent coordi-nation between our militaries, and at this point over $100 billion in bilateral trade. Prime Minister Modi in India has made a personal commitment to improving the ties between the United States and India. The Prime Minister

will come back to the United States at the end of this month. Nowhere is the potential for our stra-tegic relationship greater than in our bilateral defense relationship, which again has seen great progress over the past decade. Last year our two nations signed the framework that will ad-vance military-to-military exchanges. We are also proceeding with joint de-velopment of defense technology, which seeks to increase defense sales and to create a cooperative technology and industrial relationship that can promote both capabilities in the United States and in India. I viewed with some concern last month when the administration an-nounced the sale of these eight F–16s to Pakistan. And again I want to com-mend the leadership of the Foreign Re-lations Committee for making very clear that even if this sale should go forward, the financing of this sale is still subject to further American re-view. What brings me to wanting to sup-port Senator P
AUL’s resolution is the fact that as recently as January of this year, Pakistani-based terrorists claimed responsibility for an attack against an Indian military base at Pathankot. The attack on this air force base, which resulted in the kill-ing of Indian military forces, was a great tragedy. So far, Pakistan has re-fused to share intelligence or to turn over those suspects to the Indian Gov-ernment. With those kinds of actions, I cannot go ahead and continue this policy where we continue, in effect, to give Pakistan a pass, whether it is actions in the region vis-a`-vis Afghanistan or within their own country but also in terms of their unwillingness to meet India even halfway in terms of trying to bring a greater stability to one of the regions that could potentially be-come a tinderbox in terms of the bor-der regions between India and Paki-stan. So I will be supporting Senator P
AUL’s resolution. I hope the Govern-ment of Pakistan hears the concern of this Senator and other Senators. I hope they will act aggressively in terms of bringing justice to those terrorists who invaded Indian space and attacked the Indian Air Force base. Showing that kind of responsible behavior might lead to at least this Senator taking a dif-ferent view in terms of future military sales. With that, I yield the floor, and I rec-ognize my colleague, who I believe will bring this resolution to the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Kentucky.

Madam President, pursu-ant to the Arms Export Control Act of 1976, I move to discharge the Com-mittee on Foreign Relations from fur-ther consideration of S.J. Res. 31, re-lating to the disapproval of the pro-posed foreign military sale to the Gov-ernment of Pakistan. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The mo-tion is debatable for up to 1 hour. Mr. PAUL. Madam President, I rise in opposition to the American tax-payers being forced to pay for fighter jets for Pakistan. Over $300 million from the American taxpayers will be designated to go to Pakistan to pay for eight new F–16s for Pakistan. We have a lot of problems here in our country, my friends. We have a lot of things going on in our country that need to be taken care of, and we don’t have enough money to be sending it to Paki-stan. I can’t in good conscience look away as America crumbles at home and politicians tax us to send the money to corrupt and duplicitous regimes abroad. When I travel across Kentucky and I see the look of despair in the eyes of out-of-work coal miners, when I see the anguish in the faces of those who live in constant poverty, I wonder why the establishment of both parties con-tinues to send our money overseas to countries that take our money, take our arms, and laugh in our faces. We have given $15 billion to Paki-stan—$15 billion over the last decade— yet their previous President admits that Pakistan armed, aided, and abet-ted the Taliban. You remember the Taliban in Afghanistan that harbored and hosted bin Laden for a decade? Pakistan helped them. Pakistan was one of only two countries that recog-nized the Taliban. Why in the world would we be taxing the American peo-ple to send this money to Pakistan? Remember when bin Laden escaped? We chased him and he escaped. Where did he go? To Pakistan. He lived for a decade in Pakistan. Where? About a mile away from their military acad-emy. Somehow they missed him. There in a 15-foot-high walled compound, bin Laden stayed in Pakistan while we fun-neled billions upon billions of dollars to them. Pakistan to this day is said to look away, to not look at the Haqqani net-work. In fact, it is accused that many members of their government are complicit with the Haqqani network. Who is the Haqqani network? It is a network of terrorists who kill Ameri-cans. We have American soldiers dying at the hands of Pakistani terrorists while that government looks the other way. GEN John F. Campbell testified be-fore Congress that the Haqqani net-work remains the most capable threat to U.S. forces in Afghanistan. Yet we are asked to send F–16s and good money after bad to a government in Pakistan that looks the other way. Pakistan is, at best, a frenemy—part friend and a lot enemy. If Pakistan truly wants to be our ally, if Pakistan truly wants to help in the war on rad-ical Islam, it should not require a bribe; it should not require the Amer-ican taxpayer to subsidize arms sales. They already have 70 F–16s. They have an air force of F–16s. What would hap-pen if we didn’t send them eight more that we are being asked to pay for? Maybe they would listen. Maybe they would help us. Maybe they would be an honest broker in the fight against ter-rorism. We are $19 trillion in debt. We borrow $1 million a minute. We don’t have any money to send to Pakistan to bribe them to buy planes from us. We don’t have the money. We have problems at home. Our infrastructure crumbles at home. We have longstanding poverty at home. We have problems in America, and we can’t afford to borrow the money from China to send it to Paki-stan. In my State, in Kentucky, we have a dozen counties with unemployment nearly double the national rate. In Magoffin County, KY, 12.5 percent of people are out of work. Today, those who will vote to send money to Paki-stan need to come with me to Ken-tucky. They need to come to Magoffin County, and they need to look people in the face who are out of work in America and explain to them why we should send money to Pakistan. We have people hurting here at home. In Harlan, the President’s war on coal has led to longstanding double- digit unemployment. In Harlan, KY, people are out of work. People live in poverty, and they don’t understand why Congress is sending money to Pakistan. In Leslie County, high unemploy-ment prompts their citizens to ask: Why? Why is the government spending billions of dollars for advanced fighter jets for foreigners? They don’t under-stand it. They can’t understand, when they live from day to day, why their government is sending money to Paki-stan. As I travel around Kentucky, I ask my constituents: Should America send money and arms to a country that per-secutes Christians? I have yet to meet a single voter who wants their tax dol-lars going to countries that persecute Christians. In Pakistan, it is the law; it is in their Constitution that if you criticize the state religion, you can be put to death. Asia Bibi has been on death row for nearly 5 years. Asia Bibi is a Chris-tian. Her crime? She went to the well to draw water, and the villagers began to stone her. They beat her with sticks until she was bleeding. They continued to stone her as they chanted ‘‘Death, death to the Christian.’’ The police finally arrived, and she thought she had been saved, only to be arrested by the Pakistani police. There she sits on death row for 5 years. Is it an ally? Is it a civilized nation that puts Christians to death for criticizing the state religion? I defy any Member of this body to go home and talk to the first voter. Go outside the Beltway. Leave Congress and drive outside the Beltway and stop at the first gas sta-tion or stop at the first grocery store

and ask anybody—Republican, Demo-crat, or Independent: Should we be sending money to a country that per-secutes Christians? Asia Bibi sits on death row for criti-cizing the state religion, and your money goes to support her government. What will happen to Pakistan if they don’t get eight more F–16s? They will have only 70 F–16s. Most of the politicians here simply don’t care. They don’t care whether Pakistan persecutes Christians. They know only one way. The one way is to open our wallet and bleed us dry and hope that someday Pakistan will change its behavior. Guess what. If you are not strong enough to vote for this resolution, if you think some kind of cajoling, flattery, and nice talk with empty words are going to change the behavior of Pakistan, you have another thought coming. It has been going on for decades. When I forced a vote in the Foreign Relations Committee to say that coun-tries which put Christians to death for criticizing the state religion—there are about 34 of these countries, a couple of dozen of them who received money from us, American tax dollars going to countries that persecute Christians. When I introduced the amendment to say: Guess what. Let’s not do it any-more. Any country that has a law that compels a Christian and puts a Chris-tian to death, that country would no longer receive our money. Do you know what the vote was? It was 18 to 2 from Washington politicians to keep sending good money after bad because they say: Oh, the moderates there are going to change their minds someday. We have given them $15 billion, and I see no evidence of change in behavior. I see insolence, arrogance, and people who laugh as they cash our checks. Is Pakistan our ally in the War on Terror? Well, not only did they help the Taliban that hosted Bin Laden for a decade, but when they finally got Bin Laden, we got him with evidence that was given to us by a doctor in Paki-stan. His name is Shakil Afridi. Where is he now? Pakistan has locked him away in a dark, dank prison from which he will probably never be re-leased. Shakil Afridi has essentially been given a life sentence by Pakistan for the crime of helping the United States and helping all civilized nations get to Bin Laden. He sat under the noses of the Pakistani Government for a dec-ade. We finally got him when Shakil Afridi helped us. People aren’t going to continue to help America if we don’t help them, if we don’t protect our human intel-ligence, if we don’t protect those who are willing to help America. He sits and rots in a prison. What message do we send to Pakistan if we send them eight more F–16s and we tell you, the American taxpayer, you are paying for it? What message does that send to Pakistan? The message to Pakistan is that we will just keep thumbing our nose at America, we will keep cashing their checks, and we will laugh all the way to the bank as we do nothing to re-lease the Christians on death row or to release the doctor who helped us. Should we give planes to a country that imprisons these heroes—heroes who helped and put their lives on the line for our country? Today we will vote on whether the American taxpayers should foot the bill. I have yet to meet a voter in my State of Kentucky or across America who thinks it is a good idea to send more money to Pakistan. We have a $19-trillion debt. We borrow $1 million a minute. We have no money. It is not even a surplus. They say we are going to influence Pakistan or they may rise up and say: Oh, the resolution will not stop the money. The heck it will not. If my resolution passes, if it becomes law, the eight jets will not go to Pakistan, they will not be subsidized, and not one penny of American tax dollars will go to Pakistan. That is the absolute truth. No matter what they tell you, this stops the sale. It stops the subsidy. We have to borrow money from China to send it to Pakistan. Such a policy is insane and supported by no one outside of Washington. You go anywhere in America and ask them: Should we give money? Should the taxpayer be forced to give money to Pakistan, a country that persecutes Christians? Nobody is for it. Yet the vast and out-of-touch es-tablishment in Washington continues to do it. Is it any wonder that people are unhappy with Washington? Is it any wonder that Americans are sick and tired of the status quo, sick and tired of people not listening to them? We have no money in the Treasury. We are all out of money. This influ-ences nothing, other than to tell the Pakistanis they can continue doing what they want. I urge my colleagues to vote against subsidized sales of fighter jets to Pakistan. I reserve the remainder of my time. Can the Chair tell me how much time I have remaining? The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. S
COTT). The Senator has used 14 min-utes. Mr. PAUL. So I have 16 remaining? The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes. Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to say a few remarks about this resolution of disapproval. While I oppose this measure, I share the junior Senator from Kentucky’s frustration with some aspects of our relationship with Pakistan. Notably, I think the jailing of Dr. Shakil Afridi for 23 years under highly questionable charges is an outrage. For those of you who don’t remem-ber, Dr. Afridi helped the United States locate Osama bin Laden. His approach may have been debatable, but one thing is clear—he doesn’t deserve to languish in a Pakistani jail for more than two decades on manufactured charges. I have also been troubled by the Pak-istani military and intelligence serv-ice’s support for militant groups that work against U.S. interests in the re-gion. In fact, I would argue that many of these groups are also working against the long term interests of our friends in Pakistan as well, as evi-denced by its own domestic terrorist problem. I am also concerned that, despite im-portant foreign aid given to Pakistan, there remains a troubling failure to ad-dress basic and urgent development needs—particularly education and schooling for girls. We also see contin-ued cases of extreme religious intoler-ance, including death sentences for du-bious charges of blasphemy. At the same time, I also want to take a moment to acknowledge that Paki-stan has suffered horrible losses in tak-ing on militant groups within its own borders—something I don’t think we always recognize. And most importantly, I want to stress the importance of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee—let’s allow it to do its work and thoroughly consider this resolution first, rather than rush it through the Senate. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-jority leader. Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all time be yielded back. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. M
CCONNELL. I move to table the motion to discharge. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to table. Mr. M

GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOOD Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, today I would like to address a very impor-tant issue, which is the right for Amer-ican citizens to know what is in their food. I am going to be talking about the topic of genetically modified ingre-dients in food. I will be pointing out that there are genetic modifications that are largely considered to have been beneficial and others that are largely considered to be causing sig-nificant challenges. In both cases, there is science to bring to bear around the benefits and there is science to bring to bear around the disadvan-tages. Ultimately, I will conclude—to give a preface here—that this is not a debate about the pros and cons. There is information on both sides, different aspects. What is at debate is whether our Federal Government wants to be the large, overbearing presence in the lives of Americans and tell them what to think, or whether we believe in our citizens’ ability to use their own minds and make their own decisions. To be able to do that, they have to be able to know when there are genetically modi-fied ingredients in the foods they are consuming. Let’s start with the point that there are significant benefits from various GM modified plants. One example is golden rice. Golden rice, as seen here, has been modified in order to produce a lot more vitamin A. So growing this in an area where there is a vitamin A de-ficiency has been beneficial to the help of local populations. Let’s take, for example, a certain form of carrot. It has been modified to produce an enzyme that helps rid the body of fatty substances. When you can’t do that, you have Gaucher’s dis-ease. We have a lot of trouble with Gaucher’s disease, with brain and bone damage, anemia, and bruises. But through the modification of these car-rots, there is a solution, and should you be afflicted with Gaucher’s disease, you would be very happy about that. Let’s take another example. These are sweet potatoes that have been modified to resist a number of viral in-fections common in South Africa. So a place where otherwise you may not be able to grow these sweet potatoes, where the local population might not be able to benefit from nutrition in these sweet potatoes, they can now do so. These are some of the examples of some of the benefits that have come from some forms of genetic modifica-tion of plants. But just as there is science that shows benefits, there is also science showing concerns. I am going to start by explaining that the largest modi-fication in America—the largest de-ployed modification—is to make plants such as corn, soybeans, and sugar beets resistant to an herbicide called glyphosate. The use of glyphosate has increased dramatically over the last two decades. In 1994 we are talking about 7.4 million pounds—not very much. But by 2012, we are talking about 160 million pounds of this herbicide being put onto our crops. Well, one’s reaction may be this: OK, but is there any downside to that mas-sive deployment of herbicides? Yes, in fact, there is. This herbicide is so effi-cient in killing weeds that it kills milkweed. Well, milkweed happens to grow in disturbed soil. So it has been a common companion to our agricultural world. Milkweed is the single substance that monarch butterflies feed on. So as the glyphosate expansion has increased over this time period, the monarch but-terfly has radically decreased because its food supply has been dramatically reduced. This is not the only factor considered to affect the Monarch but-terfly, but it is an example of a signifi-cant factor. That is something of which you think: What else could happen in the natural world as a result of chang-ing dramatically the variety of plants that surround our farm fields? Let’s turn to another impact. Mil-lions of pounds of glyphosate go on the fields, and much of it ends up running off the fields and running into our streams and rivers. It is an herbicide. So it has a profound impact on the makeup of organisms in those streams and rivers. For example, it can have an impact on microorganisms, algae, and things that feed on that up the food chain— fish, mussels, amphibians, and so forth. We don’t understand all the impacts of massive amounts of herbicides in our streams and rivers, but scientists are saying: Yes, there is an impact. Studies are underway to understand those im-pacts more thoroughly. Of course, we care about the health of our streams and rivers. Let’s take another example. Some-times you just can’t fool Mother Na-ture. One impact of the massive appli-cation of glyphosate is that weeds start to develop a resistance to it, and then you have to start to use more of it. Also, that is true in a different sphere. I am talking about a particular genetic modification that goes into the cells of plants and is designed to fend off the western corn rootworm. The western corn rootworm eats corn when it is in the larvae stage—that is the worm stage—and it does so when it is in the beetle stage. Some beautiful examples are shown here. It can eat the pollination part of the corn so that the corn doesn’t produce healthy kernels as well. It can eat the leaves. It pretty much loves the entire corn plant. This genetic modification produces a pesticide inside the cell and was in the beginning very effective in killing these corn rootworms. But guess what. Mother Nature has a continuous stream of genetic mutations, and if you apply this to millions and millions of acres and millions of pounds, eventu-ally Mother Nature produces a muta-tion that makes it immune to this pes-ticide. Then those immune rootworms start multiplying, and you have to start applying a pesticide again, and maybe you have to apply even more than before because they develop a re-sistance to it. That is exactly what is happening here. So that is a significant reverberation. All I am trying to point out here is that this is not really an argument about science. Science can tell us that there have been occasions in which ge-netic modifications have had an initial beneficial impact, and science will tell us that there are situations in which the reverberations of using the geneti-cally modified plants are having a neg-ative impact. So that is where it stands. It is like any other technology. It can be beneficial. It can be harmful. So the question is this: Does our gov-ernment—the big hand of the Federal Government—reach out and say to our cities, our counties, and our States that there is only one answer to this and that is why we are going to ban you from letting citizens know what is in their food. Of course, there is no one answer. We have seen there are benefits and there are disadvantages. Quite frankly, I think it is just wrong for the Federal Government to take away our citizens’ right to know. That is why I am doing all I can to publicize this at this moment. Various States have wrestled on whether to provide information to citi-zens so that the citizens can decide on their own whether they have a product that has genetically modified ingredi-ents. Most of our food products do be-cause virtually all of our corn, sugar beets, and soybeans are genetically modified, but citizens can look at what type of genetic modification. They can respond and use their minds with infor-mation. This is really what is beautiful in de-mocracy. Government doesn’t make up your mind for you. Government doesn’t impose a certain framework in which you have to view the world. Yet, right now, at this very moment, there are a group of Senators in this

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S1425 March 10, 2016 
body who want to impose those blind-ers on you, American citizens. They want to tell you how to think. They are supporting a bill that says the Fed-eral Government will take one side of this argument and tell you it is the truth and spend your tax dollars publi-cizing it. This is the type of propa-ganda machine that you would expect outside of a democracy but not here in the ‘‘we the people’’ government of the United States of America—not here, where we value our citizens’ ability to make their own choices. So it is very important that we wake up quickly and respond to this, because the simple truth is a group of very powerful com-panies are working right now to get a bill passed that will take away our citi-zens’ right to know about GM ingredi-ents in their products. This bill is called the DARK Act, or the Deny Americans the Right to Know Act, and it has passed out of committee. The majority leader has said it is a priority for him to put the DARK Act on the floor of this Senate next week with vir-tually no notice to the United States of America. Most of these positions percolate in-side committees for a length of time and then get digested on the floor for a length of time. But, no, there is an ef-fort to slam this through—this imposi-tion on the right to know in America. That is just absolutely wrong. Now let me talk a little bit about how American citizens feel about this. There was a survey done at the end of 2015, just a couple of months ago. This was a nationwide survey of likely 2016 election voters done in November of 2015. The question that was asked of the participants was this: As you may know, it has been proposed that the Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, require foods that have been ge-netically engineered or contain geneti-cally engineered ingredients to be la-beled to indicate that. Would you favor or oppose requiring labels for foods that have been genetically engineered or contain genetically engineered in-gredients? After the respondent gives the an-swer, then the follow-up question is this: Is that strongly or not so strong-ly? Well, 89 percent of Americans say they favor mandatory labels on foods that have genetically modified ingredi-ents. That is powerful. That is nine 9 of 10 Americans. Furthermore, 77 percent of the re-spondents said that they not only favor mandatory labels but they strongly favor the proposal. Now, this is very unusual to have nine Americans line up on one side versus one on the other. Is this something that has to do with party affiliation? Absolutely not. Across the great spectrum of ideologies in America, citizens agree in this poll, with 89 percent of Independents—the same as overall—84 percent of Repub-licans, and 92 percent of Democrats. In other words, regardless of party, basi-cally 9 out of 10 individuals say the same thing on the right, on the left, and in the middle. Well, that should be listened to up here on Capitol Hill because we are in-tended by constitutional design to be a ‘‘we the people’’ government, not the government of, by, and for powerful ag companies. If you want to serve in that kind of government, go to some other country because that is not the design of our Constitution. Our responsibility is to the people of America. They don’t like Big Govern-ment trying to tell them how to think, and that is why this DARK Act is just wrong. There are some ideas floating around this building today. One of those ideas is, well, we will put a label on a food product that will be just a phone num-ber, and if you, the citizen, want to know details about this product— whether it contains genetically modi-fied ingredients—well, you can ring up this phone number and maybe some-body will answer your question. You can call the company, and the company will tell you what they think about their product. Well, first, Americans don’t want to stand there in the grocery store and start making phone calls to companies. Can you imagine, you are standing there—and you actually care about whether there is a GMO in this prod-uct. You are going to make a phone call. You are going to wait while you go through a telephone tree. You are probably going to have to speak to somebody overseas who may not even understand what you are asking, or you get a company spokesman who is going to lay out the company line and never really give you an answer. Why should you have to do that? Think about the parallel situation. We have all these other ingredients on the package. We include things such as sea salt as opposed to salt. We have preservatives. We have colors that are incorporated into the food because peo-ple want to know about the colors, the food dyes that have gone into the food. They want to know about the preserva-tives that have gone into the food. We even tell companies that on the label they have to tell the consumer whether the fish has been caught in the wild or raised on a farm. Why do we re-quire that label? Well, we require that label because citizens want to know about the ingredients in their food—in this case, the makeup of their fish, be-cause it is different. There are different farming practices between catching wild salmon and raising salmon on a farm, in a pond, or in an ocean-con-tained area. There are different im-pacts. Citizens care about that, so we require it to be disclosed. We require our juice companies to say whether the juice is fresh or recon-stituted. Why do we provide that infor-mation? Why do we require that? Be-cause citizens want to know. There is a difference between the two products, and they want to know. It is their right to know what they put into their own bodies, what they feed to their fami-lies, what their children consume. It is their right to know. Again, 9 out of 10 Americans say this is important to them. This telephone idea is just the worst possible scam. Let’s put it frankly. No-body is going to stand there comparing soups, making phone call after phone call after phone call. Nobody who wants to know if there is high fructose corn syrup in their food is going to stand there, look at a can, and dial phone number after phone number. That is why it is printed on the label. That makes it very simple. There is another idea floating around here: Put a computer code on the prod-uct, and people can scan it with their smartphone and get information. Well, this may be even more ludicrous than the phone idea in terms of stripping the power of American citizens’ right to know. First, you have to be in the grocery store, and here are the dif-ferent cans of soup you are going to compare. Oh, let me take a picture of the first one with my phone. Oh, OK, now I have to go to the Web site. I am taking a picture of the bar code, and I am going to go to the Web site. OK, which page of this Web site do I go to? Oh, look, this Web site was written by the company that makes it. They are making it hard for this in-formation to be found. They are mak-ing it hard for this to be understood. They are not disclosing the details of the type of genetic modification. Well, that is absurd. Can any Member of this Chamber really tell me—can you stand and tell me that you are going to take pictures of 10 different products while your child is sitting in your grocery cart? And that is just to buy one thing on your grocery list. Does anyone here want to stand and claim they would do that? I think the silence speaks for itself. Certainly we are in a situation where people don’t want to take pictures of these codes with their cell phones be-cause it reveals information about them that the companies collect on them. Why should they have to give up their privacy to know about an ingre-dient in their food? Let’s be clear. There are two scams being discussed right now by the ma-jority leaders of this Chamber, this es-teemed Chamber which should stand for free speech and knowledge, not sup-pressed speech and lack of knowledge. They want to send you down this rab-bit hole of 800 numbers or this blind alley of computer bar codes rather than a simple indication on a package. Let’s recognize that this is a pretty easy problem to resolve because most of the world has figured it out—64 other countries, 28 members of the Eu-ropean Union, Japan, Australia, and Brazil. They all have a simple disclo-sure on the package, a consumer- friendly phrase or symbol. That symbol is straightforward. There is no smoke-screen. There is no blind alley. There is no rabbit hole. There is no cleverness

over an 800 number or a bar code or an-other computer code called a quick re-sponse code. No, they simply give the information, the way we do on every-thing else, the way we do on preserva-tives, food colorings, core ingredients, wild-caught fish versus farm fish, and juice from concentrate versus fresh juice. They make it simple. They just have a simple marking on the package. Do you know who else provides this simple information to their consumers? China. Do our citizens deserve less in-formation than the Chinese, who live in a dictatorship? Why are Members of this Chamber trying to strip more in-formation away from American citi-zens than does the dictatorship of China? That is just wrong. There is an easy solution here. There are a number of reasonable arguments that Big Agriculture is making. They say: Look, we do not want 50 States producing 50 different label standards. I absolutely agree. They say: We don’t want a bunch of counties and cities producing yet other label standards; that could go into the thousands. Fair point. One common way of doing this would make sense. You cannot have a ware-house that is serving three or four dif-ferent States or multiple communities that need to have this product sorted and distributed, one group to here and one group to there. You can’t keep it all straight. It is expensive. There are all these different labels. It is con-fusing. That is a fair point. I agree. Let’s do one 50-State solution. The industry says: We don’t want anything pejorative. We don’t want anything that says GM is scary or GM is bad. I pointed out that there are some ad-vantages to genetic modifications and there are some disadvantages. So I agree there too. Let’s not put a mark-ing on a package that is pejorative. The industry says: We don’t want anything on the front of the package. It takes up space. It may suggest there is something scary about this if you are putting it on the front of the pack-age. OK, fair enough. Let’s not put it on the front of the package. I completely accept that point. The industry says: There are several different ways we could do this. We would like flexibility. Absolutely. Let’s have flexibility. So I have put together a bill which hits all these key points the food in-dustry has raised. It is a 50-State solu-tion. There is nothing on the front of the package. There is nothing pejo-rative. And it gives the type of flexi-bility the industry has talked about. Under the bill I have put forward, they are allowed to put initials behind an ingredient in parentheses or to put an asterisk on the ingredient and put an explanation below or to put in a phrase—as Campbell Soup plans to do— that simply says: This product con-tains genetically modified ingredients. Campbell Soup is planning to do that because they say they want a relation-ship of full integrity with their cus-tomers. Shouldn’t we all be for full in-tegrity with our citizens? Doesn’t that make a lot of sense? Yet another option would be to put a simple symbol—any symbol chosen by the FDA, so certainly not one that sug-gests there is anything pejorative about it. Brazil uses a little ‘‘t.’’ OK, how about a little ‘‘t’’ in a triangle or in a box or something else that the FDA or the food companies would like? The point is, if someone cares enough to pick up a package, turn it over, and look at the fine print on the ingredi-ents, if they care enough to look, just as they might care enough to look up whether there is high fructose corn syrup, just as they might care enough to see if there are peanuts in it because they have a peanut allergy, or just be-cause they want to look at the ingredi-ents to see how many calories are in a product, if they care enough to pick it up and turn it over, a little symbol—all of those options are available under this type of reasonable compromise. It would appear on each product involved in interstate commerce. OK, so that is consistent, and that is a point made. It is clear. These symbols are clear. The public that cares get educated. They know what to look for. It is easy to find. It is right there on the pack-age. There is no sending you off on a wild goose chase through a phone tree and an 800 number. There is no pro-ceeding to tell you that you have to use a smartphone, which many people don’t have. They might not even have reception to be able to use it effec-tively if they wanted to. No. It is a simple, straightforward phrase or ini-tials right there on the ingredients package. What could be more appro-priate than the simplicity of that? Many folks have stepped forward to say this makes tremendous sense. Campbell Soup said: Yes, we endorse this. This makes sense. Also, Nature’s Path, Stonyfield, Ben & Jerry’s, Amy’s Kitchen, Consumers Union, the Amer-ican Association for Justice, the Na-tional Sustainable Agriculture Coali-tion, and the Just Label It coalition. Yes, OK, that is fine, we are not ask-ing for something on the front of the package. It doesn’t have to be on the front. It doesn’t have to be scary. It can be in that tiny print on the ingre-dients page. When an earnest, sincere citizen wants to know, they have the right to know in a consumer-friendly fashion. I particularly thank the Senators who have already signed on to endorse this legislation: Senator L
EAHY and Senator B
ERNIE SANDERS , who come from Vermont, which has a State label-ing bill that would be preempted by this bill. It would be replaced by this 50-State national standard. But be-cause this is a fair standard for con-sumers, they are endorsing this bill. I also thank Senator T
ESTER of Mon-tana, Senator F
EINSTEIN of California, Senator MURPHY of Connecticut, Sen-ator G
ILLIBRAND of New York, Senator B
LUMENTHAL of Connecticut, Senator B
OXER of California, Senator M ARKEY  of Massachusetts, and Senator H
EIN-
RICH of New Mexico. All parts of the country, different parts of the country, and they are all saying: You know what, our citizens, 9 to 1, want a sim-ple, fair statement or symbol on the in-gredients list. That is just the right way to go. If you are going to step on the au-thority of States to provide informa-tion that citizens want, you have to provide a simple, clear, indication on the package. That is the deal. That is the fair compromise. That is standing up for citizens’ right to know. That is honoring the public interest. That is a compromise in the classic sense that works for the big issues the companies are talking about. They don’t want the expense from individual States and they don’t want the complexity and confusion from individual States. What consumers want is a simple indication on the package. Let’s do the right thing. Let’s not be worse than China and block our con-sumers from having access to informa-tion. Let’s do the right thing that vir-tually every developed country has done and provide a simple, clear sys-tem for citizens to be able to know what is in their food. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from North Carolina.

FILLING THE SUPREME COURT VACANCY Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, I appre-ciate the opportunity to come to the floor and talk a little about the ongo-ing dialogue we are having on the Su-preme Court nomination. Before I start this speech, I wanted to comment on something for those who think all we do is fight here. I think the Presiding Officer was at our bipartisan lunch. I think it is a great opportunity. So often we see the debate on the floor and the dialogue in the committee rooms, but we take the op-portunity every month or so and Democrats and Republicans come to-gether and we enjoy each other’s com-pany. We talk a little about policy but more about the folks back home. So I just wanted to let the American people know that because we happen to have differences, it doesn’t mean we don’t like and respect so many of our col-leagues. Today, though, I am talking about something that is a point of contention between Democrats and Republicans, and it relates to the open Supreme Court seat as a result of the tragic passing of Justice Scalia. Originally, I was going to come to the floor and pro-vide a speech I had prepared, but I was in the Judiciary Committee today and I decided—probably against my staff’s wishes—to deviate a little from the script and to talk about some of the facts that were put forth in the Judici-ary Committee today.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S1427 March 10, 2016 
One of the arguments we hear from Members of the Democratic Party is that somehow the Supreme Court has been shut down. That couldn’t be fur-ther from the truth. Actually, since the passing of Justice Scalia, there have been some 12 arguments heard in the Supreme Court and 5 opinions. There will be several more. As a matter of fact, over the course of history there have been a number of instances where the Supreme Court has had Justices recuse themselves or Jus-tices go on a leave of absence for an-other duty. So there have been a num-ber of instances where the Court con-tinues to function just fine with eight, and sometimes even fewer than eight, Justices active in any given opinion. So to say for some reason until we make an appointment to the Supreme Court that the Supreme Court is going to cease to function defies the facts. As a matter of fact, in the October 2014 session—the Supreme Court has two sessions, the first half of the year and the second half of the year. In Oc-tober of 2014, there were 72 arguments heard before the Supreme Court. There were only 18 of them that actually were divided along ideological lines within the Court. So three-fourths of all the cases in 2014 were actually set-tled with significant numbers of people joining together to render an opinion. So the Court is working just fine, and it will continue to work just fine. I would also argue that the idea put forth by some Members that the Su-preme Court is suddenly going to be shut down for a year defies logic and history. The Supreme Court is already in session. They will go through prob-ably the end of June or the beginning of July. There is no possible way, under normal circumstances, that we would have time to appoint a Supreme Court Justice who would be participating in this term. So what we are really talk-ing about is the October term. If the October term of this year bears any re-semblance to the October term of 2014, there may be 5 or 10 cases where the 9- member Court would be material. The vast majority of them are going to move through. That is why this idea of shutting down the third branch of gov-ernment is disingenuous and really supporting a political agenda and less about whether the government is func-tioning properly. The other thing I wanted to talk about before I get into some of the rea-sons I do not support nomination pro-ceedings going through under Presi-dent Obama is related to some history. Before I get to the history that specifi-cally relates to the constitutional obli-gation of the Senate, the Senate rules, and maybe some of the positions that have been taken by Members of the mi-nority in the past, I also want to talk about one other area that concerns me in this dialogue. There has been a discussion about the backroom meetings, making the decisions. Well, members meet often-times—we tend to meet the majority of the time—in public settings, but mem-bers got together and we decided to come up with a policy that was a clear position that the majority of the mem-bers of the Judiciary Committee—and the majority of the members are today Republicans—that we were going to take on the nomination. We all agreed—all 11 of us—that we are not going to move forward with the nomi-nation. They can call it a backroom deal, but whether you would argue that is an im-proper practice, what I found inter-esting is that members of the Judiciary Committee who brought this up did something that I think was a profound show of disrespect to this institution. It happened a few years ago, when in a back room the leader of the then-ma-jority, Senator R
EID, convinced all the members of the Democratic conference to vote on the nuclear option. The nu-clear option is—well, it is great I guess for TV—but structurally the nuclear option is that throughout decades there was a 60-vote threshold for mov-ing nominations through the Senate unless you had consensus to hold it down to 51 votes. In a back room, the then-majority leader, Senator R
EID, convinced his conference to come to this floor and break the rules to change the rules in order to prevent the minor-ity from being able to weigh in on judi-cial nominations and a number of other nominations. In fact, after that rule was passed, after that decision was made in a back room and after those folks came to the floor and broke the rules to change the rules, they ended up confirming judges without any input from the then-minority Repub-licans. So when people want to stand up here and say that somehow what we did was different, this is one nomination. This is a decision we made about one nomi-nation, but we have a group of people— every single person on the Judiciary Committee, in fact, who are in the Democratic conference, voted to deny the minority from having what has been a decades-old tradition in the Senate to have the minority weigh in on nominations. I would now like to get to some of the other discussions. First off, we have to recognize we are in the throes of the primary season for the Presi-dential nomination. It would be very difficult to live in the United States and not know a little about the pri-mary that is going on. The people are in a position where, over a very few short months, they are going to make a decision. They are going to voice their vote, and I, for one, think the people should be allowed to weigh into this decision. I do believe many of the Senators on the other side of the aisle have felt the same way. In fact, I will go through a couple of quotes where they made it very clear. In fact, they are very trained and very articulate and can probably voice their position— which now is my position—better than I ever could. One thing that comes up in this dis-cussion is our constitutional obliga-tion, and that is the obligation to ad-vise and consent. Keep in mind, the ad-vice and consent is not a constitutional obligation for the Senate to rubber-stamp the decisions of the President. Quite the contrary. The whole idea of the three branches was to have certain checks and balances in place. So there absolutely was no concept on the part of the Founding Fathers to say when the President makes a decision, the Congress will rubberstamp that deci-sion. We then have an equal authority to determine whether that nomination will come to a nominations process or we will simply decide not to take up the nomination. Now, a lot of people think that is a new concept, but the reality is, it is a concept that has been in place for many years in the Senate rules. For people to say we always dispose of nominations in the term we are in de-fies the existence of this rule, which simply says: Should the Senate choose not to take up a nomination, then the next President will put forth another nomination for consideration. Again, I think people are finessing what our responsibilities are and whether this is really something dif-ferent or something that wasn’t antici-pated by the people who have come be-fore us and who established the rules that govern the Senate. I want to talk a little about what I think must be a very uncomfortable place for some Members of the minor-ity to be; that is, their own history on the current situation in the Senate. We are in the middle of a campaign. We are in the middle of a tough campaign on both sides of the aisle, whether it is the Democratic primary or the Repub-lican primary. People are engaging in a way they haven’t in many years. Turn-outs in many of the primaries have been more significant than they have been in many years. People are watch-ing. So we have an opportunity to edu-cate the people on this very important choice in terms of a Supreme Court nomination. I, for one, think the nomination should be instructed by the vote that is cast in November for the President, and, actually, for that matter, the Sen-ate congressional elections. Some peo-ple say: Well, the people have spoken and President Obama was reelected to a second term. That is true. And 2 years later the people spoke again, and I was elected to the Senate and Repub-licans were brought to a majority. So the people spoke in a different way. Just a few months from now we will get the most up-to-date read of where the American people are, who they want to lead the country, and who they want to nominate as the next Supreme Court Justice. This quote has been famously re-ported in the press, and I couldn’t say it any better than then-Senator B
IDEN did. He talked about the need, at a cer-tain point in time during the political

process, to set things aside, let the peo-ple speak, and let that be instructive to the Supreme Court nomination. Incidentally, I know the Vice Presi-dent, at the time he made this quote, was the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, the position Senator G
RASSLEY currently holds. He was basi-cally saying what Senator G
RASSLEY  has said and that I fully support. So I think Vice President B
IDEN was right the first time. He seems to be stepping back on his words, but I don’t think his words can be parsed. They were pretty well-articulated right here on the Sen-ate floor. Then we come to the minority leader. We now have the minority leader and others coming to the floor talking about what our constitutional duty is, but the minority leader came to this floor—right over there, not very far from where I am now—and he said: 
The duties of the Senate are set forth in the U.S. Constitution. Nowhere in that docu-ment does it say the Senate has a duty to give presidential appointees a vote. 
I agree with Senator R EID. And fi-nally, we have one from my good friend from New York, Senator S
CHUMER . Senator S
CHUMER is a very articulate man. He is a practiced attorney, and there are many aspects of the man I admire. In another instance, in a very passionate speech given—it is on YouTube so you can all watch it—he has taken a very similar position; that circumstances get to a point to where maybe we need to hold nominations until we get the information we need that is instructive to the future nomi-nation or the future vote or consent matter. I agree with Senator R
EID’s 2005 statement, I agree with Senator B
IDEN, Chairman B
IDEN, now-Vice President B
IDEN’s statement of 1992, and I agree with Senator S
CHUMER ’s of 2007. My colleagues, it is time for us to move on and recognize the position we have taken is a position that is going to stand. We can go to the American people back in our States, States like North Carolina, where we have a pri-mary next week, and I will be traveling all across the State tomorrow and Sat-urday, back again on Monday. I will ex-plain to them why I have taken the po-sition I have, and when we do, all the games that are being played now, with one poll saying one thing or another poll saying another thing, we can cut through the noise and talk about what we are really trying to do. What we are trying to do is to give the people an opportunity to voice where they want to take the direction of the Supreme Court, where they want to take the Nation in terms of the Presidency, and where they want to take the Nation in terms of the Con-gress. I am willing to bet on the peo-ple’s voice, and I am looking forward to it being instructive to the ultimate de-cision I make about a Supreme Court nominee. I love getting letters from folks in my State, so the last thing I leave you with is a quote from a lady named Lois from North Carolina. I think she does a good job of summing up my own feel-ings. She said: I really wish the discussions and hoopla could have waited a little longer after Judge Scalia’s passing, but we are having the back and forth of what to do. As your constituent, I’m in agreement with the committee posi-tion of waiting until after we have a new President. Word out of the White House to the Senate is: Do your job. Well, I, for one, think you are doing your job. It’s called checks and balances. 
In the coming weeks, I am looking forward to continuing this debate. I want to especially note that Senator G
RASSLEY is a wonderful Member of the Senate. He has support and admiration from both sides of the aisle. I appre-ciate his leadership on this matter. I appreciate Leader M
CCONNELL ’s leader-ship on this matter. I look forward to getting back to North Carolina and hearing what the people would like for me to consider as we move forward with the nomination process. I thank the Presiding Officer. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. C

AIR SERVICES AGREEMENT WITH CUBA Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, last month we reached a milestone in the continuing reform of our policy toward Cuba. The United States and Cuba completed a bilateral air service agree-ment that is key to ensuring the con-tinued travel of Americans to the is-land. The newly minted air services agreement will, for the first time in 50 years, provide scheduled air service be-tween the United States and Cuba, in-cluding 20 daily flights to Havana and 10 daily flights to other Cuban airports. As someone who believes that all Americans should have a chance to see a living museum of a failed socialistic experiment, I look forward to the day when all Americans can use Web sites they are familiar with to make res-ervations, even with their frequent flyer miles, to book flights to Havana and elsewhere in Cuba. Clearly, there is interest on our side of the Florida Strait. With easing of regulatory re-strictions, authorized travel to Cuba by Americans has increased by more than 50 percent in just one year. Freedom to travel between the two countries will continue to open cultural and eco-nomic ties, benefiting the Cuban people and Americans alike. While I ardently support everyone’s right to travel to Cuba, key to the suc-cess will be ensuring that the initial flights being awarded by the Depart-ment of Transportation provide for the continued and expanded ability of the Cuban American community to travel to the island via regular air service. This should include adequate regular service to accommodate the growing demand from the largest and closest Cuban American population located in Miami-Dade County. In addition, having traveled to Cuba multiple times over the years, I hope that the Department closely evaluates the complexity of operating there and ensures that those selected to operate these routes are up to the task—those with experience. A failure-to-launch scenario would represent a critically missed oppor-tunity represented by the potential of successfully scheduled air services be-tween the United States and Cuba. We can’t afford to let this opportunity go to waste. I have long supported efforts to re-store the rights of American citizens to travel to Cuba and have introduced leg-islation to lift the statutory ban on travel, along with my colleague from Vermont, Senator LEAHY . I am pleased to say that our legislation continues to gain bipartisan support. As the situation changes on the ground with developments like regular air service, direct air service, and scheduled air service, I hope that thou-sands upon thousands of Americans will visit Cuba and Congress will do the right thing when it comes to changing our outdated law. I yield back, Mr. President. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

REMEMBERING JUSTICE ANTONIN SCALIA Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the Nation has lost one of the greatest Jus-tices ever to sit on the Supreme Court, Antonin Scalia. My condolences and prayers go out to his wife of 55 years, Maureen, his 9 children, and 36 grand-children. My thought is that Justice Scalia’s greatness was founded on the power of his ideas. His defense of those founding principles of America at the highest in-tellectual level is unprecedented, to my knowledge, in the United States. Over his career, he moved the legal world. As a young lawyer out of law school, I remember what the trends were and how Justice Scalia relent-lessly, intellectually, aggressively, and soundly drove the message that many of the ideas that are out there today are inconsistent with the rule of law and the American tradition. The trend was relentlessly toward ac-tivism. Judges were praised if they ad-vanced the law—not when they fol-lowed the law, or served under the law,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S1429 March 10, 2016 
or the Constitution, but if they ad-vanced it. By advancing it, what that really means is you change it. If you advance it, it means the legislature hadn’t passed something that you would like, or the Constitution doesn’t advance an idea that you like, then you figure out a way to reinterpret the meaning of the words so it says what you would like it to say and what you wish the legislature had passed. One of the bogus ideas at that time— you don’t hear much about it anymore, but it was current, and it was main-stream then—was that the ink-stained parchment, well over 200 years old and right over in the Archives Building, was alive. Our Constitution, they said, was a living document. Well, how ridiculous is that? The judges said that the Constitution gave them the power to update it, advance it, and make it say what they wanted it to say. They even contended that it was the duty of the judge, not just the privilege of the judge, to advance the words of the Constitution. Justice Scalia saw this as a direct threat, and he understood at the most fundamental level who was threatened by it, and that was ‘‘we the people.’’ You know how the Constitution be-gins with ‘‘We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domes-tic Tranquility, provide for the com-mon defence, promote the general Wel-fare . . . do ordain and establish’’? Well, friends and colleagues, we estab-lish this Constitution, the one we have, not the one some judge would like it to be or some politician would like it to be but the one we have. He boldly criticized the idea that a mere five judges—it just takes five out of nine—with lifetime appointments who are totally unaccountable to the American people. We are prohibited from even reducing their pay, which I support because we want an inde-pendent judiciary. Judges need to know they are given independence and a lifetime appoint-ment because we trust them to serve under the Constitution and not above it. They serve under the laws duly passed by the elected representatives of the people of the United States, not above those laws. They were not given the power to set policies that they would like to set no matter how strongly they feel about it. That is not what they have been given to do. He boldly criticized those ideas and those individuals and didn’t mind saying it in plain words: You are setting policy, you are not following the law. I would say that Professor Van Aylstyne—while at William & Mary or Duke—had a great quote about this. He said: If you really honor the Constitu-tion, if you really respect the Constitu-tion, you will reinforce it as it is writ-ten whether you like it or not. If judges today can twist the Con-stitution to make it say something it was not intended to mean, how might a new Court—five judges in a new age a decade or two from now—reinterpret the words to advance an agenda during that time? Isn’t that a blow to the very concept of the democratic Republic we have? I think so. I will tell you that this has been a long and tough intellectual battle. You don’t hear many people say that paper document over in the Archives is a liv-ing thing. Of course it is not a living thing. It is a contract. The American people have a contract with their gov-ernment. They gave it certain powers and reserved certain powers for them-selves. They reserved certain powers for their States, and the Federal Gov-ernment is a government with limited power. This is absolutely, undeniably fundamental, and people don’t fully un-derstand it today. I remember when I was a U.S. attor-ney back in Alabama and an individual brought me a high school textbook. He said: I want you to see this. The book said: How do you amend the Constitution? It talked about sev-eral different ways to amend the Con-stitution, such as Congress and the Constitutional Convention, but it also said by judicial decision. He said: Mr. U.S. Attorney, I thought the judges were bound by the Constitu-tion. They don’t get to change the Con-stitution. Well, of course that is correct. But, in effect, we have had many instances when judges, through their interpreta-tion, have in effect amended the Con-stitution. It is an absolute legal her-esy, and they should not do that. It weakens the power of the democracy. One of the things that I think is very unfortunate is that judges have created an incredible amount of law that is contrary to common sense in the area of religion in the public life of Amer-ica. Many of these cases are very con-fusing. But Justice Scalia, in a series of cases where he wrote the majority opinion, or wrote the dissent, or wrote concurring opinions, applied the prin-ciples of the Constitution as they were intended to lay out a lawful and com-monsense framework for faith in the public square. I think that is a signifi-cant achievement. When Chief Justice Roberts came be-fore our committee for confirmation, I remember telling him: Sir, I would like you to try to clear up and bring some common sense to the expression of faith. You have a right to free speech in America, you have a right to the free exercise of religion under the Con-stitution, so how has it gotten around that you can be protected more in filthy speech than you can be protected in religious speech? So as I said, Justice Scalia issued a series of opinions that were important on this subject. For example, in 1992, the Supreme Court decided Lee v. Weisman. This case involved a chal-lenge to a Rhode Island public school policy that permitted a member of the clergy to deliver prayers at middle school graduation ceremonies. In this instance, a rabbi had delivered a prayer at one such ceremony, and one of the families in attendance that objected brought suit, alleging that the school’s policy permitting prayer at graduation was a violation of the First Amend-ment’s Establishment Clause. By a vote of 5-to-4, the Supreme Court con-cluded that the school’s policy violated the Establishment Clause. Justice Scalia dissented. He wrote: 
In holding that the Establishment Clause prohibits invocations and benedictions at public school graduation ceremonies, the Court—with nary a mention that it is doing so—lays waste a tradition that is as old as public school graduation ceremonies them-selves, and that is a component of an even more longstanding American tradition of nonsectarian prayer to God at public cele-brations generally. 
Two years later, the Supreme Court decided Board of Education of Kiryas Joel Village School District v. Grumet. This case involved a challenge to a New York statue that tracked village boundaries to create a public school district for practitioners of a strict form of Judaism known as Satmar Ha-sidim. By a vote of 6-to-3, the Court concluded that the government had drawn political boundaries on the basis of religious faith in violation of the First Amendment’s Establishment Clause. Justice Scalia dissented. He wrote: 
the Founding Fathers would be astonished to find that the Establishment Clause— which they designed to insure that no one powerful sect or combination of sects could use political or governmental power to pun-ish dissenters, has been employed to prohibit characteristically and admirably American accommodation of the religious practices— or more precisely, cultural peculiarities—of a tiny minority sect....  Once this Court has abandoned text and history as guides, nothing prevents it from calling religious toleration the establishment of religion. 
Ten years later, in 2004, the Supreme Court decided Locke v. Davey. In this case, a student challenged a Wash-ington State statute which created a scholarship for students enrolled ‘‘at least half time in an eligible postsec-ondary institution in the state of Washington,’’ but excluded from eligi-bility for this scholarship students seeking degrees in devotional theology. A student sued to enjoin Washington from refusing to award him a scholar-ship. By a vote of 7-to-2, the Supreme Court upheld the statute. Justice Scalia dissented. He wrote that: 
When the State makes a public benefit generally available, that benefit becomes part of the baseline against which burdens on religion are measured; and when the State withholds that benefit from some indi-viduals solely on the basis of religion, it vio-lates the Free Exercise Clause no less than if it had imposed a special tax. That is pre-cisely what the State of Washington has done here. It has created a generally avail-able public benefit, whose receipt is condi-tioned only on academic performance, in-come, and attendance at an accredited school. It has then carved out a solitary course of study for exclusion: theology.

Kentucky. This case involved a chal-lenge to the placement of the Ten Com-mandments on the walls inside two Kentucky courthouses. By a vote of 5- to-4, the Supreme Court held that the placement of the Ten Commandments inside of courthouses was a violation of the First Amendment’s Establishment Clause. Justice Scalia dissented. He wrote that: 
Historical practices demonstrate that there is a distance between the acknowledg-ment of a single Creator and the establish-ment of a religion. The former is, as Marsh v. Chambers put it, ‘‘a tolerable acknowledg-ment of beliefs widely held among the people of this country.’’ The three most popular re-ligions in the United States, Christianity, Judaism, and Islam—which combined ac-count for 97.7% of all believers—are mono-theistic. All of them, moreover (Islam in-cluded), believe that the Ten Command-ments were given by God to Moses, and are divine prescriptions for a virtuous life. Pub-licly honoring the Ten Commandments is thus indistinguishable, insofar as discrimi-nating against other religions is concerned, from publicly honoring God. Both practices are recognized across such a broad and di-verse range of the population—from Chris-tians to Muslims—that they cannot be rea-sonably understood as a government en-dorsement of a particular religious view-point. 
More recently in 2014, Justice Scalia dissented from a denial of certiorari in the case of Elmbrook School District v. Doe. In this case, the entire seventh circuit, over three dissents, held that a suburban Milwaukee public high school district violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment by holding its graduation in a non-denominational church. Justice Scalia wrote that: 
Some there are—many, perhaps—who are offended by public displays of religion. Reli-gion, they believe, is a personal matter; if it must be given external manifestation, that should not occur in public places where oth-ers may be offended. I can understand that attitude: It parallels my own toward the playing in public of rock music or Stra-vinsky. And I too am especially annoyed when the intrusion upon my inner peace oc-curs while I am part of a captive audience, as on a municipal bus or in the waiting room of a public agency. In this case, at the request of the student bodies of the two relevant schools, the Elmbrook School District decided to hold its high-school graduation ceremonies at Elmbrook Church, a nondenominational Christian house of worship. The students of the first school to move its ceremonies pre-ferred that site to what had been the usual venue, the school’s gymnasium, which was cramped, hot, and uncomfortable. The church offered more space, air conditioning, and cushioned seating. No one disputes that the church was chosen only because of these amenities. In this case, it is beyond dispute that no religious exercise whatever occurred. At most, respondents complain that they took offense at being in a religious place. It bears emphasis that the original understanding of the kind of coercion that the Establishment Clause condemns was far narrower than the sort of peer-pressure coercion that this Court has recently held unconstitutional. 
Although many of his dissents were memorable, not all of Justice Scalia’s notable opinions on religion in public life were issued in dissent. In 1995, Jus-tice Scalia wrote the opinion for the Court in Capitol Square Review and Advisory Board v. Pinette, where the Court rejected an Establishment Clause challenge to the Christmas sea-son display of an unattended Latin cross in a plaza next to the Ohio State Capitol. Writing for the Court, Justice Scalia said: Respondents’ religious display in Capitol Square was private expression. Our prece-dent establishes that private religious speech, far from being a First Amendment orphan, is as fully protected under the Free Speech Clause as secular private expression. Indeed, in Anglo-American history, at least, government suppression of speech has so commonly been directed precisely at reli-gious speech that a free-speech clause with-out religion would be Hamlet without the prince. 
And just last term, Justice Scalia wrote the opinion for the Court in EEOC v. Abercrombie & Fitch Stores, a case about accommodation on the basis of religion in the employment environ-ment. In this case, a Muslim individual who wore a head scarf as part of her re-ligious observation applied for a job at a clothing retailer, but was not hired due to the company’s policy, which prohibited employees from wearing ‘‘caps.’’ In reversing the court of ap-peals in favor of the applicant, Justice Scalia wrote that: 
Congress defined ‘‘religion’’ for Title VII purposes as ‘‘including all aspects of reli-gious observance and practice, as well as be-lief.’’ Thus, religious practice is one of the protected characteristics that cannot be ac-corded disparate treatment and must be ac-commodated. 
As we see, these opinions by Justice Scalia involve parties of varied faiths— Christians, Jews, and Muslims. Regard-less of the identity of the party, Jus-tice Scalia’s opinions on religion in public life consistently evidence a deep respect for the unique history of reli-gious pluralism in this country and a heartfelt appreciation for its positive impact across the landscape of the na-tion. While some may say his opinions are not consistent, I disagree. Religion in American life is an important and complex subject. Judges must think carefully but not abandon common sense as so many opinions have. Jus-tice Scalia saw limits on free exercise of religion when it came to the conten-tion, for example, that one’s religion required the use of drugs that a State had declared illegal. So this is an important area that needs to be cleared up so that we can bring some reality to the question of the expression of religious conviction in public life. Because the Constitution says we shall not establish a religion— Congress shall not establish a religion. It doesn’t say States couldn’t establish a religion; it says Congress can’t estab-lish a religion. It also says ‘‘nor shall Congress prohibit the free exercise thereof.’’ So you can’t prohibit the free exercise of religion. I think we have forgotten the free ex-ercise clause and over-interpreted the establishment of religion. Some States at the time had established religions. Most of the countries in Europe had a religion that they put in law for their country, and we said: No, we are not going to establish any religion here. You have the right to exercise your re-ligious faith as you choose. Madison and Jefferson particularly believed it was absolutely unacceptable for this government to tell people how to relate to that person they consid-ered to be their creator. That was a personal relationship that ought to be respected and the government ought to have no role in it. Like Madison and Jefferson, Justice Scalia, too, believed in American exceptionalism. Indeed, he was truly exceptional. Although he will be im-possible to replace, his seat on the Su-preme Court will eventually be filled by the next President. After that nomi-nee is confirmed, his or her decisions will likely impact our Nation for the next 30 years and far beyond. Next year, when we debate this eventual nominee’s qualifications to assume Justice Scalia’s seat, we need look no further than his own words for wisdom to guide us as we consider our decision. In no uncertain terms, Justice Scalia’s McCreary County dissent reminds us that: What distinguishes the rule of law from the dictatorship of a shifting Supreme Court majority is the absolutely indispensable re-quirement that judicial opinions be grounded in consistently applied principle. That is what prevents judges from ruling now this way, now that—thumbs up or thumbs down— as their personal preferences dictate. 
That is the governing principle that Justice Scalia abided by—unwavering commitment to the rule of law even when reaching the outcome that the law dictated did not align with his pol-icy preferences. This—above all things—is the duty of a judge or Jus-tice, and it is a principle that has fall-en by the wayside far too often in re-cent years. It is imperative that we keep these words in mind when we con-sider appointments not only to the Su-preme Court, but all lifetime appoint-ments to the Federal judiciary. I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. WYDEN.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S1431 March 10, 2016 
put an end to the horrible opioid epi-demic. This is a horrible, horrible health scourge that has carved a path of destruction throughout communities in Oregon and across our country. Now, over the last several weeks, I have traveled around Oregon to spend time listening to experts. We heard powerful testimony in the Finance Committee, and I have spoken with colleagues here in the Senate about the urgency and the important scale of this national crisis. The message has been very clear: Our country is paying for a distorted set of priorities. Our citizens get hooked on opioids, there is not enough treatment, and enforcement falls short. My view is that is a trifecta of misplaced priorities. What it says to me is that our coun-try needs a fresh approach where pre-vention, better treatment, and tougher enforcement work in tandem. We have to have all three working together to really get on top of this horrible, hor-rible health scourge. The Congress ought to be working overtime on poli-cies that start moving our Nation to-wards this tandem approach that I have described. Now, my view is that the bill that was passed by the Senate takes the first step toward updating the coun-try’s out-of-date approach to substance abuse. More needs to be done, and that is what I and other colleagues have pushed hard to do. I very much hope that more can be done in this Congress. As ranking member of the Finance Committee, we are required to pay for Medicare and Medicaid. I wish to spend a few minutes talking about the funda-mental role that is going to play in stemming the tide of opioid abuse. These are bedrock health programs, and they are expected to account for over a third of substance abuse-related spending in the upcoming years. We are talking about billions and billions of dollars. Medicare and Medicaid have an important role when it comes to pre-venting addiction at its source, and talking about prevention has to in-clude talking about how these drugs are prescribed in the first place. As I visited with citizens around Or-egon, I was struck—and I know of the Presiding Officer’s expertise in health care as a practitioner—by what I have come to call the prescription pen-dulum. Doctors were once criticized for not treating pain aggressively enough, and today they are criticized for pre-scribing too many opioids to manage pain. So in the days ahead, our country is going to have to look for solutions that get the balance right. During the debate on this bill, the Senate considered an amendment I wrote that would have doubled the pen-alties for opioid manufacturers who give kickbacks to prescribers and put profits over patients. It has been well documented in recent years that com-panies are pushing the unapproved use of some drugs at the expense of patient safety. It is high time for real account-ability when the manufacturers go too far. My amendment would also have made significant progress to connect those struggling with addiction to ap-propriate treatment. Some parts of the bill the Senate passed crack down on those on Medicare who are suspected of abusing opioids. It is an enforcement- only approach, and my view is that the story cannot stop there. Without treat-ment, those addicted to opioids might try to get their pills on the street or turn to heroin. My amendment would have ensured that those who are at risk for opioid abuse are connected to meaningful treatment choices so they can better manage their pain and limit excessive prescriptions. I also proposed an amendment that would have helped some of the most vulnerable Americans, including preg-nant women on Medicaid who struggle with addiction. The costs of inaction here add up every single day for moms and their babies. A recent Reuters in-vestigation found that, on average, an opioid-dependent baby is born every 19 minutes. These are high-risk preg-nancies that can have lifelong con-sequences for mothers and their chil-dren. Some of these babies tragically aren’t going to make it. Many of them are going to be placed in foster care if their mothers cannot break their ad-diction. So it is critical that these women have and retain full access to pre- and post-natal care as well as addiction treatment. Yet, today, if a pregnant woman on Medicaid receives treatment for drug or alcohol dependency, in cer-tain in-patient facilities, that woman loses her health coverage for the dura-tion of her stay. That just defies com-mon sense. The good news is, the country has a pretty good idea of a straightforward solution. There is no reason someone who is pregnant should lose access to their health insurance. This amend-ment simply states that no pregnant woman would lose her Medicaid while she receives treatment for addiction. To be clear, this amendment doesn’t instruct Medicaid to pay for these treatment services. That charge re-quires a broader debate. I do believe, though, in the meantime, access to services like prenatal care should not be restricted for pregnant women who want to receive care for their addic-tion. It is unfortunate these amendments didn’t make it into the Senate legisla-tion today, but I have seen a number of times—and I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate—that sometimes we don’t win on day one, and you have to come back again and again and again. A few weeks ago, a bill I authored well over a decade ago, the Internet Tax Freedom Act, finally got passed permanently into law. So sometimes when something is impor-tant, you just have to stay at it, and I want colleagues to know I think the CARA bill is a good start. It focuses on enforcement, but unless you get the prevention and treatment part of it in addition to enforcement, you are not going to get the job done properly. The Congress obviously has some tough choices to make. If prevention and treatment aren’t addressed up-front, the costs are going to be even higher—pregnant mothers giving birth to opioid-dependent babies, EMTs in emergency rooms dealing with over-dose calls every night, county jails taking the place of needed treatment, able-bodied adults in the streets in-stead of working at a family wage job. American tax dollars need to be spent more wisely, and it is my view the Sen-ate has to come back to this issue. It has to come back to this issue and get the job done right. I indicated earlier that I am very much aware of the expertise of the Pre-siding Officer in health care and his in-volvement as a practitioner, and I look back, as I said, to how the prescription pendulum has moved. It wasn’t very long ago when I was of the view that there wasn’t enough done to manage pain. As patients began to insist on those kinds of drugs and therapies to help them with their pain, we saw they were able to get relief. The pendulum may have swung the other way now, and there is too much prescribing. I don’t pretend to be the authority on how to get the prescription pendulum right, but I do know from listening to practitioners in the field, to citizens, to grieving parents, that you have to have more than enforcement. That is what the Senate has done with the bill that was passed today. The story must not end there. The Senate can do bet-ter in the days ahead. The Senate can fill in the rest of the story and ensure that in addition to enforcement, there will be prevention, there will be treat-ment, and a sensible policy that en-sures that these three priorities work in tandem and is what the Senate pur-sues on a bipartisan basis in the days ahead.

WOMEN’S HEALTH CARE Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I want to spend just a few minutes to discuss women’s health care because I believe women’s health care in America is in trouble—very deep trouble. It is in trouble in Congress, it is in trouble in the courts, and it is in trouble in our statehouses. In these bodies, I think there is a serious risk to women’s ac-cess to affordable, high-quality health care. There is an assault on women’s right to choose their own physicians and their own providers, and that as-sault is wrong. Drip by drip, State by State, the assault goes on. The latest example is in Florida, where lawmakers seem to be heading down the same road that Texas and Louisiana have traveled, restricting the choices of women. This all began with a Texas law, HB2, that has been challenged all the way to the U.S. Su-preme Court. Arguments were heard just last week. HB2 backers have ar-gued the law is about protecting wom-en’s health. My view is that is pretty

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES1432 March 10, 2016 
much fiction. HB2 has very little to do with women’s health. It is a thinly veiled scheme to block women’s health choices with unjustifiable require-ments for abortion clinics. The AMA and the American Congress of Obstetri-cians and Gynecologists—people who obviously have expertise on this issue— have said very clearly in a legal brief, an amicus brief, that the restrictions are ‘‘contrary to accepted medical practice and are not based on scientific evidence.’’ Despite the advice of the American Medical Association and the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, Texas went ahead with the law anyway. If it stands, the number of clinics that provide abortion care will drop by more than three-quar-ters. Now HB2 backers say it is about preventing complications from abor-tion. Yet they ignore other proce-dures—colonoscopies, for example, that have much higher rates of complica-tions. HB2 backers say women who live where these clinics have shuttered could go to other States, but the fact is, we are hearing that really isn’t an option for so many women. Louisiana just passed its own version of HB2. Just yesterday the news came down that legislators in Florida have passed a similar measure. The Florida bill goes one dangerous step further by going after funding for Planned Parent-hood. Attacks on Planned Parenthood aren’t anything new, not in state-houses like Tallahassee or here in the Congress. When you threaten Planned Parenthood in this way, you are going far beyond restricting access to abor-tion. Here is the list of vital women’s health care services which have abso-lutely nothing to do with abortion, and these services which have nothing to do with abortion are under threat: pregnancy testing, birth control, pre-natal services, HIV testing, cancer screenings, vaccinations, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted in-fections, basic physical exams, treat-ment for chronic conditions, pediatric care, hospital and specialist referrals, adoption referrals, nutrition programs. The fact is, this assault on women’s health care is going to hit disadvan-taged, struggling women hard across our country. There are countless women across America enrolled in Medicaid who rely on Planned Parent-hood and similar programs for their basic, essential medical care. It is their first line of defense for basic health care, particularly in rural communities in rural Oregon. The women know and trust their doctors at those clinics. Without those clinics, they aren’t going to have anywhere to turn for their care. If you are working an hour-ly job, you have kids to care for on your own, it is pretty clear you are not going to find an easy way to take a day off work and travel far away for med-ical care. Yet these are the kind of laws that are being passed in States across America. These anti-woman laws are unfair and they are dangerous. This will not be the last time I come to the floor to discuss this. My view is access to health care for women in this country is in trouble, and a number of the services I have talked about are es-sentially part of what is a constitu-tional right—a constitutional right. It doesn’t just mean it is a constitutional right if you are well-off. It is a con-stitutional right because the U.S. Su-preme Court has said it, and I intend to defend that constitutional right. I in-tend to do everything I can to build bi-partisan support so that instead of women’s health services being in deep trouble as I described today, women can know that those essential services are available for them across the coun-try.

STUDENT’S FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about one of our most cherished rights as U.S. citizens; that is, the freedom of speech and why allowing our children and young people to exercise this right at a young age is critical to learning and understanding complex and tough issues and ideas. The ability to effectively teach and learn journalism—and for other stu-dents to be challenged to engage in public discourse on tough issues—was severely hindered by the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 1988 in Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier. The Ha-zelwood case legitimized a school’s de-cision to remove material about di-vorce and teen pregnancy from the pages of a student newspaper on the grounds that the material was overly mature for a high school audience. Justice William Brennan, one of the First Amendment’s greatest judicial champions, dissented from that ruling in words that resonate with us here today. He said: ‘‘Instead of teaching children to respect the diversity of ideas that is fundamental to the Amer-ican system and that our Constitution is a living reality, not parchment pre-served under glass, the Court today teaches youth to discount important principles of our government as mere platitudes.’’ History has vindicated Justice Bren-nan’s dire warning. Students regularly report that they have been prevented from discussing matters of public im-portance in the pages of student media or, perhaps worse, they have restrained themselves from even attempting to address an issue of social or political concern in fear of adverse con-sequences. That is not an environment that values and empowers student voices, and it is not a climate condu-cive to the effective learning of civic participation. We can and must do bet-ter. On the 25th anniversary of the Hazel-wood decision in 2013, every major jour-nalism education organization in the Nation enacted a resolution calling on schools and colleges to abandon reli-ance on the Hazelwood level of institu-tional control. The sentiment was per-haps best expressed by the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication, the largest organiza-tion in the country of college jour-nalism instructors, which stated that ‘‘no legitimate . . . purpose is served by the censorship of student jour-nalism even if it reflects unflatteringly on school policies and programs, can-didly discusses sensitive social and po-litical issues, or voices opinions chal-lenging to majority views on a matter of public concern.’’ Since then, nine States have statutes protecting the independence of student journalists to report on issues of public concern without fear, and two have comparable protections by way of the State board of education rules. The combined experience of these 11 States spans well over 160 years, dem-onstrating that young people are fully capable of exercising a measure of le-gally protected press freedom respon-sibly and without incident or harm. I am proud to say that my own home State of North Dakota established a position of national leadership by en-acting the John Wall New Voices of North Dakota Act in 2015. The statute was named in memory of a truly amaz-ing educator, John Wall, who lived his own civics lesson by running for the North Dakota House of Representa-tives, where he served with great dis-tinction for 10 years after retiring from a 34-year career as a public school teacher. The New Voices Act passed the North Dakota State Legislature with bipar-tisan sponsorship and without a single negative vote. That is truly an amaz-ing fact. As we think about the impor-tance of student journalism, the impor-tance of voicing opinions and the im-portance of learning the value of par-ticipation through the First Amend-ment or through speech, I am often re-minded of a personal incident that I had in my family. My daughter was not on the school newspaper when she was in high school, but she frequently wrote a column. One column that she wrote generated a lot of controversy in a very small town at a time when it was much more con-troversial. It was an article that pro-moted marriage equality. She ended up getting a lot of grief and a lot of nega-tive attention as a result of writing that article. My daughter is pretty opinionated. So it didn’t bother her too much. But many years later, I received a letter from a mother. That letter from a mother talked about how she was in a same-sex relationship, had been most

of her life and most of her daughter’s life, and how once my daughter had published this article in the Mandan school newspaper, it changed the out-come. It changed the way her daughter went to school every day because she knew she wasn’t alone. She knew some-one was there in that school who un-derstood her challenges and supported her family. So where it may not move big issues—and it may not be a big, moving example like Hazelwood—it can, in fact, change outcomes. The ability to express yourself, the ability to be part of a community where we have open ideas is absolutely instru-mental and critical to the future of our country. When you look at the restrictions that still today are put on student press and student newspapers, we know we have to do better. I applaud the new voices of North Da-kota organization and its founder, Pro-fessor Steven Listopad of Valley City State University and those teachers, professors, and students around the country who engage in similar efforts for helping shine the Nation’s atten-tion on the urgent need to protect meaningful and candid journalism so that young people have an opportunity to participate and drive the civic dia-logue about the world in which they live and they will eventually lead. The skills learned and developed by student journalists and the roles they can play in driving public conversation among their peers speak to the indis-pensable role that journalism can play—if adequately supported by our schools—in educating the next genera-tion for the careers of the future and for preparing our children to discuss, debate, and lead on important and con-troversial issues. I think that, as we are moving for-ward and taking a look at what can be done, it is important that we all appre-ciate that the First Amendment is not something that you should just learn in school books. It is something that you must exercise. And the sooner you exercise that First Amendment right to speech, the sooner we recognize that young voices in this country are as critical as older voices and no student should be restricted or prevented from expressing an opinion and the stronger we will grow in our democracy. I look forward to continuing to work on this issue. I look forward to taking on the difficult task of talking about what we can do nationally to advance this, but I mainly came to the floor to applaud the great State of North Da-kota for recognizing the importance of students’ First Amendment rights. I encourage all Members in this Chamber to examine what happens at home with students’ First Amendment rights, to provide leadership, to pro-mote those rights in their State, and to potentially look at how we can reverse the Hazelwood decision so that we can grow a more confident, a more edu-cated, and a more diverse population for our future. With that, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. SASSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

REMEMBERING DOCTOR QUENTIN YOUNG Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes to talk about an extraordinary person who passed away on Monday, March 7, at the age of 92. Dr. Quentin Young was a dedicated physician and an advocate for civil rights in Chicago. Some of Dr. Quentin’s patients in-cluded the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., the Beatles, Studs Terkel, the late Mayor Harold Washington, and even President Obama. Dr. Young’s commitment to the com-mon good is what makes him a legend. He spent 35 years at Cook County Hos-pital and 56 years of private practice in Hyde Park improving health care while fighting for social justice and racial equality. His autobiography is titled, ‘‘Everybody In, Nobody Out: Memoirs of a Rebel Without a Pause.’’ And he meant it. Doctor Quentin Young grew up in Hyde Park in Chicago’s Southside. And when America entered World War II, he enlisted in the Army and served his country honorably. After returning from the war, Dr. Young graduated from medical school at Northwestern University and would go on to spend 35 years at Cook County Hospital treating patients and becom-ing a moral voice during the Civil Rights era. When people outside of Chi-cago hear the words Cook County and hospital, people think about the show ‘‘ER’’ and doctors resembling George Clooney. For the people in Chicago, they think of Dr. Quentin Young. Dr. Young’s experience at Cook County Hospital and his efforts during the Civil Rights movement were inter-twined. In 1951, he was a founder of the Committee to End Discrimination in Chicago Medical Institutions, which fo-cused on ending racist practices in Chi-cago’s hospitals and clinics. By 1960, the Cook County Hospital was serving the Black community and immigrant Mexican community almost exclusively. Eighty percent of Chi-cago’s Black births and nearly half of all Black deaths were at Cook County Hospital. This place was one of the frontlines of social inequality and Dr. Young and his family fought to change that. His efforts were not limited to the Chicagoland area. Dr. Young was a founder and national chairman of the Medical Committee for Human Rights or MCHR, which formed in June 1964 to offer support and medical care for civil rights workers, community activists, and summer volunteers working in Mississippi during the Freedom Sum-mer. It was the MCHR that provided help and emergency medical care to anti- war protesters at the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. In Oc-tober of that year, Dr. Young received a summons by the House Un-American Activities Committee for his involve-ment in MCHR. He valiantly defended the MCHR’s work. After Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., was struck in the head by a rock while marching through a White neighbor-hood, Dr. Young was there to patch him up. He was not only Dr King’s phy-sician but a fellow marcher during the Marquette Park protest in 1966. Dr. Young and the late Dr. Jorge Prieto, former head of the Chicago Board of Health, became the primary force behind the movement to found neighborhood medical clinics in the late 1960s. These clinics gave medical help to countless people when they couldn’t afford to go to the doctor. From 1972 to 1981, he served as chair-man of Medicine at Cook County Hos-pital. His example helped bring many dedicated people back to the hospital, but it wasn’t without challenges. The staff went on strike because of the lack of resources in 1975. Dr. Young sided with the young doctors, and the gov-erning commission fired him for it. With loyalty, the striking staff took his office door off its hinges so manage-ment couldn’t change the locks and held a 24-hour vigil outside his office until he regained his position after a court fight. In 1980, Dr. Young founded the Chi-cago-based and Illinois-focused Health & Medicine Policy Research Group, which conducts research, education, policy development, and advocacy for policies that impact health systems to improve the health status of all people. He would go on to serve as Mayor Har-old Washington’s appointment as presi-dent to the Chicago Board of Health. Dr. Quentin Young never lost his pas-sion for providing equal access to health care for the people of Illinois. Since retiring from private practice in 2008, he fought hard for a single-payer system. In 2001, at the age of 78, he walked 167 miles across Illinois, from Mississippi River to Lake Michigan, with former Governor Pat Quinn to promote access to health care. He never wavered in his belief in hu-manity’s ability and responsibility to make a more equal and just nation. My prayers and thoughts go out to his fam-ily, Michael, Ethan, Nancy, Polly, Bar-bara, William, Karen, and his nine grandchildren.

the growing problem of drug addiction in rural communities. As we gathered in Rutland in March 2008, the mayor noted in his opening statement that there was a part of him that wished that the committee did not have to be there in his city that day. He wished that his community was not facing the scourge of drug abuse and addiction that was creeping across rural Amer-ica. But in true Vermont fashion, Mayor Louras and the other community lead-ers, law enforcement officials, and health professionals who gathered with us that day in March 2008 did not shy away from the problem. Instead, we had an honest discussion about how to fight this problem together and about how the Federal Government could help. Over the past 8 years, we have continued this important conversation at other hearings I convened in St. Al-bans, in Barre, and again in Rutland. We have heard testimony from commu-nity leaders and officials throughout Vermont about the growing problem of opioid addiction. In St. Albans, for ex-ample, Dr. Fred Holmes told us tragic stories about teenagers getting hooked on OxyContin and other opioids and then committing crimes to support their habits. These stories have been heartbreaking. Despite these difficult cir-cumstances, I am struck by the deter-mination of Vermonters to come to-gether to address this crisis—and to do so not just through law enforcement and locking people up, but through comprehensive prevention, treatment, and recovery programs. In Rutland, for example, Project VI-SION brings together city officials, law enforcement, and social services to work together, all in the same office, to confront the problems of drug abuse and related crime. What they have found is that something as simple as sharing office space improves commu-nication and coordination and begins to turn the tide. Mary Alice McKenzie, executive di-rector of the Boys & Girls Club, testi-fied at the most recent hearing in Rut-land about children who are neglected because their parents are opioid ad-dicts and how there is sometimes no money for food because parents have spent it on drugs. Kids are also becom-ing addicts at younger and younger ages. The Boys & Girls Club has re-sponded by extending evening hours and staying open on Saturdays. They now serve dinner 6 nights a week and drive kids home after dark. They pro-vide safety for these children. They are also working with schools and public health officials to provide education and prevent them from getting swept up in that world. At that same hearing, Vermont’s health department commissioner, Harry Chen, described to us Vermont’s innovative and successful ‘‘hub and spoke’’ treatment model. This system has two levels of care, with the pa-tients’ needs determining the appro-priate level. Although challenges re-main and waiting lists are still too long, I believe this system can be a model for the Nation’s response to the opioid crisis. Earlier this year, we heard powerful testimony from Governor Shumlin about the progress that Vermont has made because of this comprehensive approach—but also about the work that still remains to be done. Vermont’s focused and persistent ef-forts are now drawing attention and replication in communities across the Nation. In many ways, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, or CARA, builds upon the work in Vermont. To specifically address the opioid problem in Vermont and other rural areas, I made sure that CARA will help get the overdose-reversal drug naloxone into more of our rural com-munities. Getting naloxone into more hands will save lives. I also ensured that CARA includes a new Federal grant program to fund expanded treat-ment options for heroin and opioid abuse and Federal funding to expand State-led anti-heroin task forces. I am proud to be a cosponsor of CARA, and I am glad to see the Senate pass this bill. This bill is historic be-cause it marks the first time that we are treating addiction like the public health crisis that it is. We are not im-posing harsh and arbitrary mandatory minimum sentences on those who abuse drugs. We are not condemning the poor and sick among us to be warehoused in our Nation’s jails. Today I am hopeful that we have fi-nally learned our lesson from the failed war on drugs. But our work is not done. The Senate missed an opportunity to provide real funding for this effort when Repub-licans blocked Senator S
HAHEEN ’s amendment that would have provided for emergency supplemental appropria-tions, so we need to keep fighting to ensure that we provide the necessary resources to support implementation of this bill. In Vermont and across this country, there are few issues more pressing than opioid and heroin addic-tion, and I will not stop working with people throughout our State to help fight this epidemic. Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, earlier today the Senate overwhelming passed the Comprehensive Addiction and Re-covery Act, which is a good first step toward combatting the opioid addition epidemic facing our Nation. The bill authorizes expanded treatment options and empowers local health and law en-forcement agencies to intensify efforts to combat opioid addiction. This bill is a good start, but there is a lot of work left to do to address this increasingly dire situation. This body needs to put real resources behind the initiatives we approved today and place a greater pri-ority on investing in research for non- opioid alternatives to pain manage-ment. The CDC estimated that, in 2014, overdose related to prescription pain killers killed nearly 19,000 Americans. In Montana alone, according to the Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services, prescription drug overdoses led to at least 369 deaths and more than 7,200 hospital inpatient ad-missions and emergency department encounters statewide over a recent 3- year period. The effects of opioid addic-tion are undisputedly devastating. It is also important to keep in mind that chronic pain is a very real prob-lem that affects millions of Americans. When discussing the negative con-sequences of opioids, we must also re-member that effective treatments for chronic pain are absolutely necessary for those struggling with long-term pain management. That is why I believe it is time to de-vote more energy and funding to the development of non-opioid painkillers. Early stage research in my home State of Montana is demonstrating incredible promise in developing non-opioid drugs that could help treat both chronic and acute pain. I am confident that med-ical professionals will eventually be empowered to offer their patients effec-tive pain management alternatives that may significantly reduce our soci-ety’s reliance on opioids. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the coming months to find ways to invest in the research and development of non-opioid painkillers. In the meantime, I encourage Federal agencies, such as the National Insti-tutes of Health, to ramp up focus on finding alternative treatments for chronic pain to reduce our Nation’s de-pendency on opioids. Thank you. (At the request of Mr. REID, the fol-lowing statement was ordered to be printed in the R

REMEMBERING JUSTICE ANTONIN SCALIA Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, on Feb-ruary 13, 2016, Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia passed away in his sleep. He was an enduring legacy of the Reagan administration and the con-servative standard not only on the Su-preme Court but for the entire Amer-ican judicial community. History will remember Scalia as a stalwart defender of the Constitution and a brilliant legal mind. He authored the majority opinion on countless rul-ings of the Court, preserving and pro-tecting our Nation’s founding prin-ciples. His intellectual honesty, as well as his humor, will be greatly missed.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S1435 March 10, 2016 
Justice Scalia played a pivotal role in the shaping of constitutional inter-pretation throughout his 30-year ten-ure on the Supreme Court. He had within him a fervor for law and order; yet he demonstrated a warmth that resonated with many colleagues on both sides of the political divide. Scalia built meaningful relationships across that divide which were indic-ative of the strength of his character. Hadley Arkes, an expert in constitu-tional law, said that Scalia was able to ‘‘find something redeeming and like-able in just about everyone he met, re-gardless of politics.’’ This was no doubt a reflection of his strong Christian background and tremendous character. You can learn the character of a man best by listening to how those who knew him speak of him. Former col-leagues and intellectual adversaries alike are unrestrained in their kind words for Justice Scalia. Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer spoke fondly of the late Justice, saying: ‘‘Nino sparkled with enthu-siasm, energy, sense of humor, insight, and seriousness of purpose—the very qualities that I and his other col-leagues have benefited from in more re-cent years.’’ Justice Thomas described Scalia as a patriot with a true calling for inter-preting the Constitution and noted that their relationship flourished based on that common interest. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg also described their re-lationship as close and ‘‘how blessed she was to have a friend of such bril-liance, high spirits, and quick wit.’’ Scalia had a positive impact on so many lives as a Justice, a colleague, a father, and a friend. His demeanor was just and fair, but marked with person-ality and humor. Late Justice Scalia was a staunch defender of the Constitu-tion, rendering unbiased opinions and a unique perspective. Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, today I honor the late Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States Antonin Scalia. During his many years of serving our country, Justice Scalia proved to be a great defender of our constitutional liberties. Regardless of one’s politics, it is undeniable that Justice Scalia was a true patriot whose passion for up-holding our American principles was matched only by his eloquence and in-tellect. Justice Scalia’s record of public serv-ice stretched from the time President Nixon appointed him as general coun-sel of the Office of Telecommuni-cations Policy in 1971 to when Presi-dent Reagan nominated him as an As-sociate Justice of the Supreme Court in 1986, where he served until his death in February 2016. Before and inter-mingled during this service, Justice Scalia also served as an extremely tal-ented attorney in private practice, a brilliant law professor, including for my alma mater Tulane Law School in its summer programs, and an effective leader in the U.S. Justice Department at a number of levels. One of the single most memorable events in my time in the Senate was when Justice Scalia agreed to visit with and speak to me and my staff. His presence and authority impressed all of us and, as he discussed a number of topics including the importance of pro-tecting our constitutional rights; I admit to being awestruck. It was a great honor to hear directly from one of most significant jurists in American history, and I know my staff remember that day as clearly as I do. One thing that distinguished Justice Scalia was not necessarily what he did, but what he chose not to do. As a staunch adherent of limited, constitu-tional government, on numerous occa-sions, he advocated for the Court to separate itself from political fights or matters involving individuals who are free to decide their own fate. Originalism, the theory that the clear meaning given to words in the Con-stitution by our Founding Fathers should be honored, was prevalent in Justice Scalia’s decisions. He abhorred judicial activism, and he correctly un-derstood that the place for instituting laws was in the legislature, where the will of the people is democratically represented. I know that Justice Scalia will also be remembered for his upbeat nature, affability, charm, and wit. At the heart of his larger-than-life personality was an educator, a person who not only ruled on the law, but also took the op-portunity to inform readers of his opin-ions about the history behind the deci-sions. I commend his lifetime commitment as a public servant and hope his exam-ple will inspire us all as we work to re-spect the Constitution and protect the freedoms of all Americans. We would be wise to follow Justice Scalia’s lead in remembering America’s founding principles as we are deciding matters of the future. I also wish to express our deepest condolences to his wife, Maureen, and to the rest of his family. I am honored to join with the rest of the United States Senate in celebrating the won-derful memory and lasting legacy of Justice Antonin Scalia. Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in expressing the deep-est respect and admiration for Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. Our country has lost a brilliant, principled, and determined jurist. For three decades, Justice Scalia in-vigorated the Supreme Court, becom-ing an icon for constitutional originalism. He had a remarkable abil-ity to espouse legal theory with memo-rable turns of phrase, and he could ex-pose gaps in opposing opinions with laserlike precision. He did not fear dif-ferences of opinion but embraced the intellectual challenge that conflicting viewpoints could offer. The enduring friendships he made with those across the ideological spectrum are a true tes-tament to his indomitable scholarship. Antonin Scalia had a distinguished career in law, academia, and public service before being confirmed to the DC Circuit and later the Supreme Court. The many accolades and achievements of his biography are well known. But Antonin, fondly known as ‘‘Nino,’’ was much more than an ex-traordinary legal mind. He was man of faith and family, raising nine children with his wife, Maureen. His son, Christopher, wrote this in the Washington Post following his fa-ther’s death: ‘‘As proud as we are of his legacy as a jurist, of course it’s his presence in our personal lives that we’ll miss the most.’’ To his children, he was a loving father who took them to Sunday mass, listened to Bach in his study, and never shied away from playfulness at the dinner table. We will remember Justice Scalia in my home State of Mississippi, where we were honored to host him over the years. We shared with him our variety of southern hospitality during his reg-ular visits to the Magnolia State in pursuit of duck, deer, and turkey. When he wasn’t outdoors, he spent time educating the public, especially college students, delivering thought- provoking lectures at the University of Mississippi, Mississippi State Univer-sity, the University of Southern Mis-sissippi, William Carey University, and MUW. Justice Scalia’s unanimous confirma-tion as the first Italian-American Jus-tice was a historic moment for the Su-preme Court and the beginning of a leg-endary tenure that will have a pro-found effect for generations to come. He leaves a vibrant legacy—perhaps most notably characterized by his steadfast protection of the Constitu-tion as the Framers intended it. As I said shortly after learning the news of his death, ‘‘I like to think Antonin Scalia and James Madison are having the damnedest visit right now.’’ Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today we honor the life and public service of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, whose passing signifies a great loss for our country. Justice Scalia was a de-voted family man, scholar, and tireless public servant. He faithfully served Ne-vadans and all Americans for over 30 years on our Nation’s highest Court. My thoughts and prayers continue to go out to his wife, Maureen, and the entire Scalia family. Born on March 11, 1936, to Salvatore and Catherine Scalia, Justice Scalia was a disciplined, intellectual conserv-ative from a young age. A diligent stu-dent who studied his way to become valedictorian at Georgetown Univer-sity and graduating magna cum laude at Harvard Law School, Justice Scalia began his legal career in Cleveland, OH in 1961. After practicing law for 6 years in Cleveland, Justice Scalia accepted a position teaching administrative law at the University of Virginia. Justice Scalia entered public service in 1972, during which he served as gen-eral counsel for the Office of Tele-communications Policy and chairman of the Administrative Conference of

the United States. In these positions, he expanded his expertise in adminis-trative law, a topic that interested him throughout his career. In 1974, Justice Scalia became the Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel. It was here that Justice Scalia would argue and later win his first case before the U.S. Supreme Court. In 1982, President Ronald Reagan ap-pointed Justice Scalia to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. Justice Scalia’s originalist mindset, keen perception, and witty writing caught the attention of President Reagan, making Justice Scalia a top prospect to fill a potential Supreme Court vacancy. In 1986, Justice Scalia was confirmed by the Senate upon the retirement of Chief Justice Warren Burger. As a Supreme Court Justice, Justice Scalia would dramatically change the Court through his powerful dissents and sharp oral arguments. Throughout his over 30-year tenure on the bench, Justice Scalia never strayed from his conservative prin-ciples and steadfast dedication to up-holding the Constitution. His promi-nent leadership and originalist philos-ophy will never be forgotten as his leg-acy will live on through generations. I ask my colleagues and all Nevadans to join me today in remembering and celebrating the life of Justice Antonin Scalia. ∑Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, Antonin Scalia was one of the greatest Supreme Court Justices in the history of our country. A lion of the law, Justice Scalia spent his tenure on the bench championing federalism, the separa-tion of powers, and our fundamental liberties. He was a passionate defender of the Constitution—not the Constitu-tion as it has been contorted and re-vised by generations of activist Jus-tices, but the Constitution as it was understood by the people who ratified it and made it the law of the land. Scalia understood that if the Constitu-tion’s meaning was not grounded in its text, history, and structure, but could instead by revised by judicial fiat, then the people were no longer sovereign. No longer would the Nation be governed by law, which expresses the will of the people; it would be governed by, as Scalia put it, ‘‘an unelected committee of nine.’’ This, he believed, ‘‘robs the People of the most important liberty they asserted in the Declaration of Independence and won in the Revolu-tion of 1776: the freedom to govern themselves.’’ As one of the leading advocates of this restrained judicial philosophy, Justice Scalia became an intellectual force on the Court, where he authored a number of noteworthy majority opin-ions. In 1997, for example, Scalia wrote the opinion in Printz v. United States, one of the few cases in the last century where the Supreme Court has actually limited the Federal Government’s power to coerce the states. In 2001, in Kyllo v. United States, he led the Court in holding that the Fourth Amendment requires the government to obtain a warrant before using high- tech equipment to invade the sanctity of the home. And in 2008, he penned the lead opinion in District of Columbia v. Heller, which finally recognized the people’s individual right under the Sec-ond Amendment to keep and bear arms. As important as these majority opin-ions were, though, Justice Scalia was even better known for his dissents, in which he let his true personality—jo-vial, acerbic, and witty—fully shine through. Scalia understood that chang-ing the languishing legal culture would take drastic measures, so he wrote his dissents with a specific target in mind: law students. His aim? To delight their senses and engage their brains. To this end, he liberally employed colorful metaphors, pithy phrases, and biting logic; and he mercilessly, yet playfully, exposed the abundant flaws in the writ-ing and reasoning of other Justices. Pure applesauce. Jiggery-pokery. Argle-bargle. If you squinted hard enough, you could almost convince yourself that G.K. Chesterton had taken a seat on the Supreme Court. But perhaps the highest compliment I can pay to Justice Scalia is this: Sev-eral of his key opinions went against some of his staunchest supporters—and they still loved him. Why is that? The answer is simple: Even in dis-agreement, Justice Scalia’s supporters had confidence that he did not make up his mind by reading the political tea leaves, by voting lockstep with ideo-logical cohorts, or by working his way backward from a desired end to what-ever means was necessary to reach that end. Rather, he actually attempted to interpret the law; that is, he consist-ently did his best to come to a conclu-sion based on the only items that make a Supreme Court opinion valid in the first place: text and logic. You don’t have to take my word on this, though. Unlike many in our mod-ern society who espouse ‘‘diversity’’ yet surround themselves with ideolog-ical yes-men, Justice Scalia actively sought out opposing views. His typical practice was to hire at least one ‘‘lib-eral’’ law clerk per term so that he would always have someone calling him out for unexpected mistakes and weaknesses. And in the wake of Scalia’s passing, one of those clerks—a self-identified liberal—wrote the fol-lowing: 
If there was a true surprise during my year clerking for Scalia, it was how little ref-erence he made to political outcomes. What he cared about was the law, and where the words on the page took him. More than any one opinion, this will be his lasting contribu-tion to legal thought. Whatever our beliefs, he forced lawyers and scholars to engage on his terms—textual analysis and original meaning. He forced us all to acknowledge that words cannot mean anything we want them to mean; that we have to impose a de-gree of discipline on our thinking. A dis-cipline I value to this day. 
I first met Justice Scalia in 1996, when I was serving as a law clerk for Chief Justice William Rehnquist, who was a judicial gamechanger in his own right. And I had the good fortune of knowing Scalia personally for 20 years. He was brilliant, passionate, and full of humor. He adored his wife, Maureen; his nine children; and his 36 grand-children. He had a zest for life. He rel-ished anchovy pizzas at A.V. Ristorante Italiano, where he would take his law clerks and the clerks of other Justices. Over the decades, Scalia inspired and mentored a genera-tion of conservatives on the bench and in the legal academy. Any advocate who stood before Jus-tice Scalia, as I was privileged to do nine times, knew to expect withering questions that would cut to the quick of the case. When he was with you— when he believed the law was on your side—he was ferociously with you. And when he was against you, he would re-lentlessly expose the flaws in your case. President Ronald Reagan could not have picked a better person to exem-plify the true, nonpartisan role of a judge. A philosopher-king Justice Scalia was not. Rather, he showed the world, with his trademark wit and im-passioned personality, what a legiti-mate, limited, and principled judiciary would actually look like. An incom-parable writer, Scalia’s legacy will live on for generations. He wasn’t perfect, but he was close. What his supporters— myself included—treasured especially was the rock-solid ground he gave us on which to expect so much more from everyone else. And in doing so, he, along with Chief Justice Rehnquist and others, helped spark a revolution on a Court where politics and power had been the only guideposts for decision-making for far too long. That, more than anything else, is Scalia’s great contribution to the Nation and will be his steadfast legacy.∑ f 
HARRIET TUBMAN Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to honor the life and legacy of Harriet Tubman on Harriet Tubman Day. Har-riet Tubman is a true trailblazer and one of the most inspiring people in the history of our Nation and in the his-tory of the State of Maryland. Tubman was born into slavery around 1822 in Maryland’s Dorchester County on the Eastern Shore. After 30 years of enslavement, she escaped. But instead of staying up North with her newfound freedom, she returned to the Eastern Shore 13 times to lead her fam-ily and hundreds of other slaves to freedom, becoming the most well- known ‘‘conductor’’ of the Under-ground Railroad. Harriet Tubman was such a central figure in liberating slaves that many simply knew her as Moses. In addition to her work liberating slaves through the Underground Rail-road, Tubman served as a Union scout and spy during the Civil War. She was the first woman to lead an armed expe-dition, guiding the raid at Combahee

Ferry and liberating 700 slaves. After the war, she became an active leader in the women’s suffrage movement and opened a home to serve the aging Afri-can-American community in her new hometown of Auburn, NY. In 2014, Congress established the Har-riet Tubman Underground Railroad Na-tional Historical Park, which creates a National Park on Maryland’s Eastern Shore dedicated to tracing Tubman’s early life and work leading the Under-ground Railroad. Congress also estab-lished the Harriet Tubman National Historical Park in Auburn, NY, which will commemorate her later years as an active participant in the women’s suffrage movement and a caregiver for aging African Americans. I am proud that Congress has recog-nized Harriet Tubman’s lifelong dedica-tion to our country through the estab-lishment of these two national parks. We must continue to tell the stories of heroes like Harriet Tubman, amplify the voices of more women and people of color, and make sure they are equally represented in our national parks and monuments. I also urge Secretary Lew to include Harriet Tubman’s portrait on our currency as the U.S. Depart-ment of the Treasury redesigns the $10 bill. As Harriet Tubman said, ‘‘Every great dream begins with a dreamer. Al-ways remember, you have within you the strength, the patience, and the pas-sion to reach for the stars to change the world.’’ It is my hope that, as we commemo-rate this Harriet Tubman Day, we can all follow Harriet Tubman’s example and work together to change the world for the better.

HONORING OFFICER ASHLEY GUINDON Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, peo-ple across the Washington area were saddened by the death of Officer Ashley Guindon, slain in the line of duty just one day after being sworn into the Prince William County Police Depart-ment in Virginia. This brave police of-ficer is also being mourned in New Hampshire, especially in her hometown of Merrimack, where the law enforce-ment community considers her one of their own. As Merrimack Police Chief Mark Doyle said: ‘‘When any law en-forcement officer is struck down, it leaves a hole in our hearts. The fact that she and her family are part of the Merrimack community drives that point home even more so.’’ Ashley was the only child of Sharon and the late David Guindon, a Navy veteran who also served in the Marine Corps Reserve and later the New Hamp-shire National Guard. After graduating from Merrimack High in 2005, she fol-lowed in her father’s footsteps by join-ing the Marine Corps Reserve. Ashley loved flying and went on to earn a bachelor’s degree in aeronautical science from Embry-Riddle Aero-nautical University in Florida and later a master’s degree in forensic science. As a Marine Reservist for 6 years, she flew helicopters and used her forensic skills to assist the Mortuary Affairs Office. Ashley had a passion for public serv-ice and was always eager to help people in need. She volunteered with a suicide prevention program and regularly spent Thanksgiving helping out at a soup kitchen. She is fondly remem-bered by teachers and classmates at Merrimack High as exceptionally kind and friendly and as the talented leader of the Merrimack Cardinals cheerlead-ing team. As a newly sworn-in police officer, Ashley was struck down while coming to the assistance of a woman who was being threatened by her husband. ‘‘She has accomplished more in 28 years than I think I could in 100,’’ Prince William County Police Chief Stephan Hudson told The Washington Post. ‘‘That was her desire: to serve, to be involved with things that mattered, to give her life to something worth giving it to. And that’s exactly what she did.’’ In New Hampshire as in Virginia, the loss of a police officer is felt deeply in the local community and far beyond. We know that the work of law enforce-ment professionals is difficult and dan-gerous. They perform their duties with great professionalism and selflessness, putting their lives on the line every day. Ashley Guindon worked and studied hard to become a superbly qualified law enforcement professional. She was proud to wear the badge and to be a po-lice officer. She gave her life in the line of duty, coming to the assistance of a stranger. I join with so many others in the Granite State and across the Wash-ington area in expressing my respect and admiration for this remarkable young woman and my deep condolences to Sharon Guindon and the entire fam-ily. I know how proud they are of Ash-ley. We are all proud of Ashley. She was America at its finest.

TRIBUTE TO JAMES BROWN Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize James Walter Brown, a true public servant, an accomplished businessman, and a longtime family friend. Over the course of the last 30 years, Jim has served at some of the highest levels of the State and Federal Governments; most recently, as my chief of staff here in the Senate. For 9 years, my staff and I benefitted from his considerable experience, sage coun-sel, and signature personal charm. Jim’s impressive academic creden-tials prepared him well for success: a diploma from Scranton Preparatory School; an undergraduate degree from Villanova University; and a J.D. from the University of Virginia. He also has a combination of substantial public and private sector experience from which to draw. He began his public service career as a counsel and, later, staff director for the Subcommittee on Oversight for the House Banking Com-mittee. After serving the Federal Gov-ernment, Jim returned to Pennsyl-vania to join the prestigious Pennsyl-vania law firm, Dilworth Paxson, where my father was a partner. In a pattern that would be repeated throughout his career, Jim’s skill and dedication were quickly recognized by those around him, and he made partner himself in just 4 short years. When my father was elected Gov-ernor of Pennsylvania in 1986, he asked Jim to return to public service as the Secretary of the Department of Gen-eral Services for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. He would serve only 10 months in that position before being called on again by my father, this time to take on the role of executive sec-retary to the Governor. Jim continued to prove his commitment to his work and to Pennsylvania, and in 1989, Gov-ernor Casey named him chief of staff at the young age of 37. Serving as one of the chief executive officers in one of the most populous States in the Nation is a daunting task, but Jim approached this challenge like he would every other in his life: with poise, determina-tion, and a commitment to excellence. He served as chief of staff until late 1994. His strong and patient manner was crucial in guiding State govern-ment through the difficult months of 1993 while Governor Casey recuperated from serious health issues. After leav-ing State service, he continued his dedication to Pennsylvania through his service as chairman of the Pennsyl-vania Higher Education Facilities Au-thority, chairman of the Pennsylvania Public School Building Authority, and chairman of the Finance Committee of the Pennsylvania Housing Finance Agency. When I was elected to the U.S. Sen-ate in 2006, I knew Jim would be the best architect to help me build my Sen-ate organization. He moved to recruit the best and brightest for our team and quickly set up a highly functional and transparent office to work for the best interests of the citizens of Pennsyl-vania. He fostered an internal culture of hard work and mutual respect and established a firm open door policy within the office. Jim eschewed the no-tion of a hierarchical Senate office and referred to himself as the ‘‘first among equals,’’ rolling up his sleeves ‘‘for the good of the order,’’ as he was fond of saying. He took a particular interest in the professional development of our junior staff and interns, happily engag-ing in countless career counseling ses-sions, as he called them. While some managers quickly forget about the staff who move on, Jim did the oppo-site; instead, he grew with care a for-midable alumni association of past staff and interns, staying in touch with people as their careers took them to different posts here in Washington and beyond. It is a rare honor to work with any-one of Jim’s caliber, but rarer still when that person can be counted as one

of your closest friends. Over the years, from his time as a mid-level staffer in the House of Representatives, to the chief of staff to the Governor of Penn-sylvania, from his success in the pri-vate sector, to his public service in the Senate, Jim has always stood out as exceptional. Serving in the Senate has been one the highest honors of my life, equaled only by the privilege of work-ing with a man of such integrity and professionalism. As Jim leaves Senate service, I must thank his patient wife Lynne, who tol-erated her husband living in Wash-ington for half of every week in the name of public service. While Jim’s day job kept him closer to his son, Patrick; daughter-in law, Michelle; and daugh-ter, Laura, I know he is eager to give his Buick a rest and spend more time back at home in the Commonwealth. I wish Jim and his entire family good health and good fortune as they em-bark on this next phase of their lives.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
REMEMBERING LIEUTENANT JAMES J. GERAGHTY ∑Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I join with people across my State of New Hampshire in mourning the loss of State police Lieutenant James J. Geraghty, who passed away late last month after a valiant battle with can-cer. He devoted his career to public service, serving in the U.S. Army, later as a police officer in Hudson, NH, and for the last 24 years as a State trooper. ‘‘His priorities in life were well de-fined,’’ said his friend and colleague, State police Lieutenant John Marasco. ‘‘He was committed to his family, he was committed to this organization, and he was committed as the lieuten-ant overseeing the Major Crimes Unit to delivering justice to victims, many of whom were victims of homicide and relied on his voice to bring that justice to them.’’ Jim, as he was known to family and friends, was born in Boston, MA, and grew up in Tewksbury. He attended St. John’s Prep in Danvers, MA, and the University of Lowell before joining the U.S. Army in 1984. After assignments at U.S. Army bases in the southern United States and Germany, his love of New England motivated him to end his military service and return home for what would be a long career in law en-forcement. He began his service with the police department in Hudson, NH, and went on to serve for two decades as a State trooper, respected by his col-leagues as a model officer, mentor, and leader. He was promoted to detective sergeant in 2008 and took command of the major crimes unit. He retired in 2015. Jim was deeply devoted to his wife of 30 years, Valerie, and their four adult children, Jimmy, Colleen, Katie, and Erin. Friends say that his mantra was ‘‘family first.’’ He cherished annual family vacations in Wells, ME. Instead of talking about himself, he would often speak glowingly about the achievements of his children. At the 2015 Congressional Achieve-ment Awards ceremony, Lieutenant Geraghty received a richly deserved Lifetime Achievement Award—the cap-stone of a distinguished career in pub-lic service. An inscription at Arlington National Cemetery accurately de-scribes his service both in the military and in law enforcement: ‘‘Not for fame or reward, nor lured by ambition or goaded by necessity, but in simple obe-dience to duty.’’ I would like to express my gratitude to New Hampshire State police Lieu-tenant James Geraghty for his service and my sincere condolences to his be-loved wife and family.∑ f

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. REED, Mr. K IRK, Mr. D URBIN , and Mr. S
CHATZ ): S. 2668. A bill to provide housing op-portunities for individuals living with HIV or AIDS; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I am pleased to be joining my colleague, Senator C
OLLINS , in introducing a bill to update the funding formula for the Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS, or HOPWA, program. HOPWA is a program within the De-partment of Housing and Urban Devel-opment, HUD, that provides state and local governments with resources to ensure that stable housing and sup-portive services are available for low- income individuals living with HIV/ AIDS and their families. Stable and affordable housing is a critical component of treatment for HIV-positive individuals. More than half of this population will face home-lessness or an unstable housing situa-tion at some point during the course of their illness. Medication for treatment is extremely expensive, and the assist-ance offered by HOPWA results in bet-ter management of this illness, reduces the risk of HIV transmission, and en-sures that better public health out-comes can be achieved. Our bipartisan legislation seeks to strengthen HOPWA by improving the accuracy of the formula used to dis-tribute funding to housing programs that benefit people living with HIV/ AIDS. This improved funding formula would take into account the number of persons currently living in a commu-nity with HIV/AIDS. HOPWA’s current funding formula instead considers the cumulative num-ber of individuals diagnosed with HIV in a community since 1981, and in-cludes those individuals who have since passed away. In fact, according to HUD, 55 percent of the cases used to de-termine funding allocations under the current formula are deceased individ-uals. As a result, this diverts already limited funding from communities that are dealing with the effects of this epi-demic most acutely today Our bill proposes a more accurate formula that will protect low-income individuals living with HIV/AIDS and their families and will better target federal resources to the states and lo-calities with the greatest need today. In short, we hope to make the program more effective and responsive in ad-dressing the current needs of commu-nities. Furthermore, to ease the move to a fairer allocation of resources, the bill transitions current grantees to the new formula over a 5-year period. Grantees will not lose more than 5 percent of their share of HOPWA formula funds in each successive year until fiscal year 2021 and cannot gain more than 10 per-cent of their share in each successive fiscal year. I thank Senator COLLINS for her part-nership, and I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill, which will enable communities to provide care to those living with HIV/AIDS by ensur-ing that their current housing chal-lenges can be addressed.

CONGRATULATING JUDGE CYN-THIA RUFE ON WINNING THE 2016 BUCKS CO. WOMEN’S HISTORY MONTH AWARD 
HON. MICHAEL G. FITZPATRICK 
OF PENNSYLVANIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, March 10, 2016 Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, U.S. Dis-trict Court Judge Cynthia M. Rufe is the recipi-ent of the 2016 Bucks County Women’s His-tory Month Award, presented annually to dis-tinguished women whose professional and civic achievements have ‘‘made a difference.’’ Her career began as a high school teacher, later an attorney, leader and mentor. Judge Rufe was a member of the panel that estab-lished a county-wide system to provide free legal representation to civil litigants and also worked with the Bucks County district attor-ney’s office to establish safe protocols for women and child abuse victims. Prior to her appointment to the federal bench, Judge Rufe served with honor and distinction in the Court of Common Pleas of Bucks County, Pennsyl-vania. I had the great pleasure of working with Judge Rufe on issues of mutual concern dur-ing my years as a County Commissioner in Doylestown. Judge Rufe continues to advocate for legal education and mentors law students and new attorneys and regularly presents legal and eth-ics courses to state and local bar associations. Additionally, she serves as a faculty member of the TIPS Trial Academy. As the grand-daughter of immigrants, Judge Rufe takes great pride in her frequent role in naturaliza-tion ceremonies, welcoming new American citizens with sincere and inspiring words. The Women’s History Month Award pre-sented to Judge Rufe is one page in the story of generations of women whose belief in equality and justice motivated them to make a difference in society, ultimately affecting the lives of subsequent generations. Judge Rufe exemplifies a belief in our nation’s inherent values, including the rule of law and justice and, in so doing, has set an example for women who may choose to follow in her foot-steps.

FEMA DISASTER ASSISTANCE REFORM ACT OF 2015 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, March 10, 2016 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my strong support for H.R. 1471, the ‘‘FEMA Disaster Assistance Reform Act of 2015.’’ The Federal Emergency Management Act (FEMA), which was signed into law in 1979 by President Carter, provides support to improve our capability to prepare for, protect against, respond to, recover from and mitigate all haz-ards. Under the Clinton Administration FEMA be-came the premier emergency response orga-nization in the world. Mr. Speaker, we all remember the disas-trous response to Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, Louisiana and the management mis-takes that cost so many innocent Americans their lives. Since that time FEMA has vastly improved its organization and response protocols to dis-asters throughout the country. An example is FEMA’s response to the 2015 historic floods in of Houston, Texas, which helped saved countless lives. H.R. 1471 reauthorizes FEMA through Fis-cal Year 2018 authorizes millions per year up to $947 million in annual appropriations, and authorizes the National Urban Search and Rescue Response System. This legislation also contains several provi-sions intended to reduce future losses from disasters and to improve the recovery process for victims and affected communities. In addition the bill provides for a study of disaster costs and why they have continued to increase and gives greater weight to severe localized impact and adjusts disaster relief policies to reflect this change. To protect families and individuals H.R. 1471 prohibits FEMA from initiating new action to recover disaster assistance payments made to an individual or household more than three years after the payments were made, or to re-cover emergency assistance funds owed by an individual or household more than three years after the funds were determined to be owed. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1471, ‘‘FEMA Disaster Assistance Reform Act of 2015’’ provides many changes that will allow this vital agency to operate effectively and respond quickly to the areas in this country where its services are needed most. f

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, March 10, 2016 Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I proudly pause to congratulate the Northwest Missouri State University Football Program on their ninth appearance and fifth title in the NCAA Division II National Championship. It isn’t every day that a team from the 6th Dis-trict of Missouri wins a National Champion-ship, but thanks to the Northwest Bearcats it is starting to become a tradition. On December 19, 2015, the Northwest Bearcats took on the Shepard University Rams in a game at Children’s Mercy Park in Kansas City, Kansas. Although the competi-tion was undeniably tough, I never doubted the ability of our team. So when Representa-tive Alex Mooney of West Virginia challenged me to a wager over the game—I gladly ac-cepted. As all of Missouri cheered, the Bearcat football team, under the leadership and direction of Head Coach Adam Dorrel, de-feated the Rams 34–7 and sealed their place in sports history as one of only two NCAA Di-vision II teams to win five National Champion-ship titles. Mr. Speaker, I proudly ask you to join me in commending the accomplishments of the Northwest Missouri Football Team for their tre-mendous undefeated season and title. f

HON. DEREK KILMER 
OF WASHINGTON  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, March 10, 2016 Mr. KILMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the William Fenton Howe family for their contributions to the history of the Pacific Northwest and to recognize their 125th anni-versary of calling the city of Port Orchard, Washington, home. In 1888 the William Fenton Howe family mi-grated from Altoona, Pennsylvania, to Tacoma in what was then the Washington Territory.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD —Extensions of RemarksE292 March 10, 2016 
On March 6, 1891, William Fenton Howe moved his family to the town of Sidney, now known as Port Orchard, on the shores of the Sinclair Inlet of Puget Sound. The family, which consisted of his wife Emma and chil-dren Harry, William, Edwin, Roy, and Edith, moved into the house located at 307 Cline Street, which remains standing today. At the time of the Howe family’s arrival, Sid-ney was becoming known for its lumber indus-try, pottery works, small business, and agricul-tural opportunities. In 1890, Sidney became the first town in Kitsap County to incorporate and was chosen as the county seat, and later renamed Port Orchard. The Howe family was a leader in the business community and con-tributed to the town’s growth by establishing Howe Hardware, the first hardware store in the community. In 1895 the Howe family suffered a dev-astating year with the death of Emma Howe and a fire at Howe Hardware. After the losses, William Fenton Howe left his children with var-ious families in the community and headed north to Alaska to pursue opportunities to pro-vide for them. William Fenton Howe, a savvy business-man, set out to make his mark in Alaska’s booming mining industry. Not only did Mr. Howe know how to manage a hardware store, but he was also a skilled tinsmith and built stoves for the miners while they looked for gold. One of his sons, Edwin Scott Howe, joined in the pursuit of ‘‘mining the miner’’ as they built stoves that prevented the miners from facing certain death in the Arctic wilder-ness of Nome, Alaska. In Port Orchard, William Fenton Howe’s chil-dren continued their father’s legacy in the business community. After the death of Wil-liam Fenton Howe, sons Edwin and Harry opened Howe Brothers Hardware as partners. The family also owned and operated Howe Oil Company and Howe Motor Company, a Ford dealership still in operation after 103 years. Deeply embedded in the community, members of the Howe family served on town council, were engaged in civic organizations, and ral-lied the community to bring electric power to Port Orchard and the Washington Veterans Home Retsil to Kitsap County. Mr. Speaker, the Howe family has a long lineage of public service in the business com-munity as well as in local government and local organizations. In 2013, the Howe family was one of five families to be recognized for their contributions to Port Orchard and the sur-rounding area by the Kitsap County Historical Society. I am honored to recognize the Howe family’s contributions to the community of Port Orchard and recognize their 125th anniversary on this past Sunday, March 6, 2016. NANCY DAVIS REAGAN: TIRELESS ADVOCATE FOR DRUG ABUSE PREVENTION, ALZHEIMER’S DIS-EASE RESEARCH AND FORMER FIRST LADY OF THE UNITED STATES 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, March 10, 2016 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Nancy Davis Reagan, the former First Lady of the United States, who died on March 6, 2016 at her home in California at the age of 94. Born July 6, 1921, in New York, New York, Nancy Davis Reagan was the only child of Kenneth Robbins, a salesman, and Edith Luckett Robbins, an actress. In 1929, Edith Luckett Robbins married a prominent Chicago neurosurgeon, Loyal Davis, who adopted young Nancy in 1931. Nancy Davis studied drama at Smith Col-lege where she earned a baccalaureate de-gree in 1943. After college, Nancy Davis followed her dreams to pursue a career in acting. Her first role was a nonspeaking part in the touring company production of Ramshackle Inn. The play eventually made it to Broadway in New York City, where Nancy Davis landed a minor role in the 1946 musical Lute Song, starring Yul Brynner and Mary Martin. In 1949, Nancy Davis noticed that her name was listed on the Hollywood blacklist, which was established by the film industry to warn studios and producers of individuals suspected of being communist sympathizers. This case of mistaken identity resulted in Nancy Davis meeting the love of her life and husband, Ronald Reagan, who at that time was the president of the Screen Actors Guild. They were married on March 4, 1952, and within a few years daughter Patty and son Ronald were born, joining Maureen and Mi-chael, Ronald Reagan’s children by a prior marriage. Nancy Reagan became California’s first lady in 1967, when her husband was elected to Governor of California. In 1980, Nancy Reagan became the First Lady of the United States when her husband was elected the 40th President of the United States. As First lady she championed the ‘‘Just Say No’’ campaign to help dissuade youth from using and abusing drugs. Nancy Reagan worked tirelessly to retrieve a number of White House antiques, which had been in storage, and placed them throughout the Executive Mansion. During the Reagan Administration, Nancy Reagan was known most importantly as the president’s personal protector. After her husband’s term was completed Nancy established the Nancy Reagan Founda-tion to support after-school drug prevention programs. Nancy Reagan and President Ronald Reagan retired to the ‘‘Reagan Ranch’’ in Santa Barbara where they devoted much of their time to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library. After President Reagan was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s Disease in 1994, the couple founded the Ronald and Nancy Reagan Re-search Institute, located in Chicago, Illinois. As Ronald Reagan’s disease progressed, Nancy became the primary caregiver for her husband. After President Ronald Reagan’s death in 2004, Nancy Reagan became a supporter of stem-cell research. Nancy Reagan was a true symbol of Amer-ican elegance during her time as First Lady of the United States and a tireless advocate for those Americans who suffer from Alzheimer’s Disease. Mr. Speaker, I ask the House to take a mo-ment of silence in remembrance of this ex-traordinary woman who transcended political lines.

HONORING PERCY CONWAY AND THE HI-STYLING BEAUTY CEN-TER ON 50 YEARS OF SUCCESS 
HON. DANIEL LIPINSKI 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, March 10, 2016 Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. Percy Conway who is cele-brating 50 years as owner of Conway’s Hi- Styling Beauty Center in Fairmont, Illinois. Mr. Conway has been barbering since he was ten years old on his father’s porch in Canton, Mississippi. Looking for work he moved to Illinois in 1950 and settled in Fair-mont, an unincorporated area between Lock-port and Joliet. He got a job at Mastic Tile Company in Joliet, but was called to serve his country in the Korean War. After his return from the Army, he saw a need for jobs and services in Fairmont so he decided to become an entrepreneur and opened the Hi-Styling Beauty Center. When he opened his shop, roads in Fairmont barely existed and some areas had no water service. While serving his customers, he frequently lis-tened to their concerns with the state of the community. Rather than confine himself to his barber-shop. Mr. Conway saw an opportunity to help his community. He was elected to the Lock-port Township Board of Trustees where he served for twenty years. While on the Board of Trustees he worked to secure a $1.3 million loan from the federal government to install sewer and water serv-ices. This work opened the door to new im-provements to the area including paved roads and small business opportunities. Through his work, Fairmont has changed into the diverse community it is today. Percy Conway can still be found most days at Hi- Styling Beauty Center, imparting his wisdom. He also serves on the boards of several non- profits and remains involved at Shiloh Baptist Church. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking Mr. Percy Conway for all he has done for his community and to congratulate him on 50 years of business success.
