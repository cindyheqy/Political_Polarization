RECOGNIZING WKIP NEWS RADIO 
HON. CHRISTOPHER P. GIBSON 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, May 29, 2015 
Mr. GIBSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize WKIP, a news radio station serving the residents of New York’s Hudson Valley. This year marks the station’s 75th anniversary of operations, and I congratulate them on reaching this impressive milestone. 
On Friday, June 5 WKIP will celebrate its 
anniversary with a live broadcast from the Henry A. Wallace Center at the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum in historic Hyde Park. As area residents gather for this special event, I want to take this op-portunity to express my gratitude to the staff, hosts, and management of WKIP for their commitment to our community. 
We rely on locally-operated media organiza-
tions like WKIP to keep us informed of news and weather and to partner with our small businesses to help them grow. This radio sta-tion is an important component of the social fabric in our region, broadcasting announce-ments from government officials, emergency information, and valuable updates on public events, school activities, local sports, and ways that we can be helpful to our neighbors. WKIP programming helps bring people to-
gether, and I am proud to recognize this orga-nization’s many contributions to community life and the economy in the Hudson Valley over the past 75 years. 
WKIP listeners are also provided a daily 
platform for the exchange of ideas, which is crucial to the health of our democracy. I am deeply grateful to WKIP for carrying out this mission and for inviting me to be a part of its programming as I endeavor to represent the residents of the 19th District of New York. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to send my best wishes 
to everyone assembled for the WKIP anniver-sary gala in Hyde Park.

DEDICATION OF THE LGBT MONU-
MENT IN ABRAHAM LINCOLN NA-TIONAL CEMETERY 
HON. MIKE QUIGLEY 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, May 29, 2015 
Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the Chicago Chapter of American Veterans for Equal Rights, which dedicated a monument for LGBT Veterans in Abraham Lin-coln National Cemetery in Elwood, IL on May 25, 2015. This is an historic day, as this is the first federally-approved monument honoring 
LGBT veterans to be dedicated in a National Cemetery in the United States. 
It is fitting that this monument is located in 
the Abraham Lincoln National Cemetery. President Lincoln was not only our 16th Presi-dent and from the great state of Illinois, but he was also the founder of the National Cemetery system. His Gettysburg Address of 1863 be-came a model of the principles of nationalism, republicanism, equal rights, liberty, and de-mocracy. 
I am grateful for the efforts of the American 
Veterans for Equal Rights (AVER) and their continued commitment and dedication to equal rights and equitable treatment for all present and former members of the United States Armed Forces. 
Thanks to Stanley J. Jenczyk and his col-
leagues with the Chicago Chapter of AVER, the LGBT veteran community will have a last-ing tribute honoring their achievements and sacrifices. This monument recognizes the in-numerable accomplishments of our military and forever commemorates their endeavors as servants of our great nation. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me 
in celebrating this significant dedication with the Chicago Chapter of American Veterans for Equal Rights. I am honored to have such an exceptional organization in my district.
