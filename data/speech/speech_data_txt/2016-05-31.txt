CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF ERIC BRADLEY 
HON. TED LIEU 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, May 31, 2016 Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life of Eric Brad-ley—husband, father, and community leader— who passed away on Sunday, May 15, 2016. Eric was well known locally and nationally as a political activist and strategist who pos-sessed unparalleled abilities in organizing and advocating for numerous causes. He served his community, his state, and his country loy-ally and effectively through his work. Eric began his career after studying political science at the University of California, Santa Barbara and continued to serve the people of Southern California until his last days. He dedicated his life to improving the lives of oth-ers and he will be remembered for his com-passionate spirit, which moved everyone who met him. Trusted and beloved by many, Eric was a man of resolute character, integrity, honesty, and kindness. His advice was invaluable and his approval, once earned, was treasured. He believed in fairness and justice for all; equal opportunity and protection under the law; cre-ating an economy that supports everyone, es-pecially working families; and above all, the value of public service. Eric Bradley’s legacy will live on in the insti-tutions that he served and through the people that he empowered. He is survived by his wife, Gail Bradley, and his son, Anders Brad-ley, whom I hope take comfort in the way he lived as an outstanding and honest man. I ask that my colleagues join me in recognizing Eric Bradley’s incredible life.

CELEBRATING THE 68TH YOM HA’ATZMAUT, ISRAEL’S INDE-PENDENCE DAY 
HON. JERROLD NADLER 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, May 31, 2016 Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 68th Yom Ha’Atzmaut, Israel’s Independence Day, which took place on May 12th, 2016. Sixty-eight years ago, the founders of Israel sat in a hall at the Tel Aviv Museum of Art and made the fateful decision to declare Israel an independent state for the Jewish people. Fol-lowing centuries of persecution in Europe, the Middle East, North Africa, and even, sadly, the United States, with the worst culmination of anti-Semitism during the Shoah—in which six million Jews were systematically executed— Israel became the first modern homeland for Jews. I am proud that the United States of Amer-ica played a role in the birth of this new state, becoming the first country in the world to rec-ognize Israel’s existence just minutes after David Ben-Gurion proclaimed Israel’s nation-hood. President Truman rightfully understood the new State of Israel represented the same western democratic values that the United States cherished, and acknowledged that an independent state for the Jewish people was long overdue. His endorsement of the State of Israel on May 14, 1948 sealed our two nations in an unbreakable bond that remains strong to this very day. Over the last sixty-eight years, the relation-ship between the United States and Israel has flourished. In addition to promoting our contin-ued shared values, Israel has emerged as a crucial ally in the Middle East, and a strong partner in our work to enhance global security. Furthermore, Israel has contributed valuable innovations to the global community that help our businesses run more efficiently and make our world more environmentally friendly. Mr. Speaker, I stand here today proud of my work to support and strengthen the U.S.-Israel relationship. On this occasion, I reflect on the importance of maintaining strong ties with Israel, and remind my colleagues of the impor-tance of working together to create a lasting peace in the region. I congratulate the State of Israel on its sixty- eighth anniversary, and am confident that our bond will remain unbreakable for years to come. f 
CELEBRATING THE CAREER AND CONTRIBUTIONS OF JOHN KELSALL 
HON. LINDA T. SA´NCHEZ 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, May 31, 2016 Ms. LINDA T. SA´NCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the career and contributions of Mr. John Kelsall, the President and CEO of the Greater Lakewood Chamber of Commerce, located in my con-gressional district. As the head of the Chamber of Commerce for more than ten years, Mr. Kelsall has been a tireless champion for local and small busi-nesses in Lakewood. Throughout his tenure, Mr. Kelsall has been instrumental in creating new programs to benefit the Lakewood com-munity. His ‘‘Shop Lakewood, Stay Lakewood Local’’ initiative to improve commerce within the city was so successful that the city adopt-ed it as one of its mottos. He also insisted on starting business councils, including those for veteran-owned and home-based companies. More recently, Mr. Kelsall shifted his focus to bringing new businesses into Lakewood. After seeing a need in his community for an establishment that sells fresh organic produce, he and the Chamber of Commerce partnered with the city and Lakewood Center mall to make it happen. Due to his vision and leader-ship, Lakewood opened its first Farmer’s Mar-ket just a few weeks ago. This is just a small sampling of the many initiatives spearheaded by Mr. Kelsall during his time at the Lakewood Chamber. For the past decade, Mr. Kelsall has been a terrific leader for the Lakewood business community, but his greatest achievement may be as an advocate for veterans returning to ci-vilian life. Following the tragic death of his son Lieutenant Commander Jonas Kelsall, a U.S. Navy SEAL, in 2011, anyone could excuse Mr. Kelsall time to grieve. Instead, he and his wife Teri Kelsall poured their energy into providing opportunities for our returning servicemen and women. In 2012, the Kelsalls founded the Jonas Project, a nonprofit that offers mentorship and services to veterans who wish to start a business. In just four years of oper-ation, the Jonas Project has aided in the de-velopment of a number of successful, veteran- owned small businesses across the country. America needs more people like John Kelsall. Faced with unspeakable tragedy that would halt so many of us in our tracks, he in-stead chose to use his talent to create an or-ganization dedicated to serving those men and women who risk their life to preserve our free-dom. We owe our veterans an unpayable debt, and so I hope that Mr. Kelsall and the Jonas Project will inspire others to help ease their transition back to civilian life. I applaud Mr. Kelsall on his successful tenure at helm of the Lakewood Chamber and wish him well as he departs that post to dedicate himself full- time to the Jonas Project. f

IN REMEMBRANCE OF THE LIFE OF SARID CHAIM SHAHDAIAH AND QUINCY GEMAL WILLIAMS 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, May 31, 2016 
‘‘What is a fear of living? It’s being pre-eminently afraid of dying. It is not doing what you came here to do, out of timidity and spinelessness. The antidote is to take full responsibility for yourself—for the time you take up and the space you oc-cupy. If you don’t know what you’re here to do, then just do some good.’’—Maya Angelou 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in remembrance and recognition of the life of Sarid Chaim Shahdaiah, and Quincy Gemal Williams two very accomplished young men who tragically lost their lives in a car ac-cident on December 3, 2014. Many parents, teachers, neighbors and young people hope to find the kindness and dedication that these two young men exhibited regularly as sons, students, friends and in-credibly well-rounded, commendable young men. The achievements these young men earned far exceed the highest expectations of any proud parent or community member in awe of exceptional young leaders in today’s America. I understand as well, that in recognition and honor of his pursuit of excellence, several highly esteemed universities expressed inter-est in Sarid, hoping that he would join their re-spected student bodies. I was thoroughly impressed to learn that, through his dedication to his studies, Sarid earned a grade point average of 3.6 and was inducted into the National Society of High School Scholars. As a highly accomplished student-athlete, he served the U.S.A. International Football Team as Captain, Team Ambassador and starting linebacker, in addition to exalting fer-vent school pride, during his junior year as a highly valued teammate of the DeKaney Wild-cats, his high school varsity track and football teams. Expanding the bounds of his requisite stud-ies, he explored his curiosities for the world of science becoming a member of the Texas High School Engineering Career and Tech-nology Council. I join his family and many admirers in genu-inely celebrating Sarid’s life and outstanding contributions. Quincy was a beaming light of talent and happiness. Affectionately called by his parents a ‘‘Jun-ior’’, Quincy was one of the most outgoing, lovable kids that a parent could ever want. Quincy was one of the world’s best come-dians. He had the ability to make anyone who came into contact with him laugh. All who knew Quincy admired his prowess for presentation—deemed one of the ‘‘sharp-est’’ brothers you’d meet. Although young in body Mr. Williams was old in song; He was a profound lover of any and all Motown Performers and would listen to them regularly. While at Andy DeKaney High School Quincy became branded as the ‘‘Soul Brother’’ of the football team. Quincy was also a highly valued teammate of the DeKaney Wildcats high school varsity track team. Quincy and Sarid were not only classmates and teammates, they were bonded and tal-ented friends who earned the love and respect by all those who knew them. These two young men cultivated their ef-forts, positioning themselves to successfully matriculate in May of 2016; and, but for their ill-fated passing, would by all accounts have celebrated their well-deserved accomplish-ments with their families as a milestone achievement in their young lives. While I have no doubt they would have real-ized countless ambitions, we are left to accept that their dreams of immeasurable magnitude now rest with them. These young men worked hard and touched many lives with their ambition and dedicated commitments to their families, friends, school and their community. I cannot think of a more solemn manner of celebrating their life than to honor their efforts by bestowing upon their families recognition of the achievement for which they so ardently strode. In the words of Booker T. Washington ‘‘character is power’’. Character truly is power and that power was present in the lives of these prolific young men. Yes, their lives were cut short, but with what time they did have they effectively made the best of it. Heaven has truly gained a dynamic pair of angels, while young Sarid and Quincy’s fami-lies lost their most promising stars. Please join me in a moment of silence for the life of Sarid Chaim Shahdaiah and Quincy Gemal Williams.

SUPPORT FOR THE ESTABLISH-MENT OF A ‘‘NATIONAL CAMEROONIAN HERITAGE AND DIASPORA MONTH’’ 
HON. CHRISTOPHER P. GIBSON 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, May 31, 2016 Mr. GIBSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my support for the establishment of a ‘‘National Cameroonian Heritage and Diaspora Month’’ during the month of May to celebrate the great contributions of Americans of Cameroonian immigrant heritage in the United States, who have enriched the history of our Nation. Mr. Speaker, people of recent Cameroonian immigrant heritage and the greater Cameroonian diaspora are found in every State of the Union. Furthermore, the history of Americans of Cameroonian descent in the United States is inextricably tied to the story of the Nation. This past year, I have been proud to estab-lish and co-chair the Congressional Cameroon Caucus, along with Congressman A
NDRE´CAR-
SON(D–IN), Congressman S TEVE RUSSELL (R– OK) and Congressman H
ANK JOHNSON (D– GA). The Congressional Cameroon Caucus enjoys strong bi-partisan support, which in-cludes Congresswoman S
HEILA JACKSON -LEE (D–TX). The community of Americans of Cameroonian immigrant heritage in the United States poses an inherently diverse population comprised of distinct ethnicities, religions and more than 100 language dialects. Americans of Cameroonian immigrant heritage in the United States come from all regions in Cam-eroon and do not constitute a homogeneous group. They include people from different reli-gious, linguistic, ethnic, racial, cultural, and so-cial backgrounds. Cameroon is nicknamed ‘Af-rica in Miniature or Mini Africa’ for its religious, linguistics, geographic and ethnic diversity. Mr. Speaker, the month of May has been celebrated by Cameroonians at home and abroad, since 1972, because ‘Cameroon Na-tional Day’ is on May 20. Since independence in 1960, Cameroon has earned a reputation as a peaceful and welcoming nation, and as a linchpin of regional stability. Undoubtedly, Cameroon serves as an important economic, military, and cultural partner of the United States. Additionally, Americans of Cameroonian de-scents have traced their heritage via DNA to various kingdoms in Cameroon such as Bamileke, Hausa, Tikar, Baka. Individuals such as Secretary Condelezza Rice, Con-gresswoman KAREN BASS, Congresswoman Kelly Robin; artists such as Quincy Jones, Blair Underwood, Venessa L. Williams, Sheryl Lee Ralph; and thousands of Americans of Af-rican-American, Afro-Latino America, Afro-Eu-ropean Americans and others, have traced their heritage to Cameroon. Recent Cameroonian immigrants have also made significant contributions to American cul-ture, including in areas of American life such as the military, health care, arts, education, community service, and public policy. Raising awareness about Cameroonian immigrant her-itage is crucial to effectively fighting disparities within the greater Black population in the American narrative and is essential to building a stronger America. Additionally, Americans of recent Cameroonian immigrant heritage have played an active role in the civil rights move-ment and other social and political movements in the United States such as Sylvie Qwasinwi Bello of the Cameroon American Council. Mr. Speaker, the people of Cameroon share the hopes and aspirations of the people of the United States for peace and prosperity throughout the world, but there remains much to be done to ensure that Americans of recent Cameroonian immigrant heritage and the greater Cameroonian diaspora have access to resources and a voice in the United States Government and continue to advance in the political, social, and economic landscape of the United States. Celebrating ‘National Cameroonian Heritage and Diaspora Month’ in the month of May would provide the people of the United States with an opportunity to recog-nize the achievements, contributions, and his-tory of and to appreciate the challenges faced by Americans of recent Cameroonian immi-grant heritage. For that reason, Mr. Speaker, I believe that a ‘‘National Cameroonian Herit-age and Diaspora Month’’ should be recog-nized in May to celebrate the significant con-tributions of Americans of recent Cameroonian Immigrant Heritage to the history of the United States.
