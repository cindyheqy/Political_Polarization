May this assembled body be an exam-ple of one who keeps the weight of this responsibility forever in the forefront of their mind so that their decisions will impact our Nation in positive ways for all our generations. As we raise up the foundation of laws to govern us now, may we be called the repairer of the breach and the restorer of homes to people everywhere. Let us always remain a country that stands for righteousness, freedom, and truth, and may the light from this Na-tion continue to shine forth as a bea-con of hope showing what the power of God’s love can produce. Thank You for listening to our peti-tion here today and for the blessings that You have made and will make abundant throughout this great and powerful Nation.  I pray this in the name of Jesus.

RECOGNIZING THE HONORABLE STEPHEN T. AYERS 
HON. JEFF FORTENBERRY 
OF NEBRASKA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 2, 2018 Mr. FORTENBERRY. Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize and pay tribute to the Honor-able Stephen T. Ayers, the 11th Architect of the Capitol, on his retirement after 21 years of service to the United States Congress. Stephen started his career as an officer in the U.S. Air Force. In 1997, Mr. Ayers joined the Architect of the Capitol as an Assistant Superintendent for the Senate Office Build-ings. He served in several capacities over the next decade before his appointment as Archi-tect of the Capitol in May 2010. As Architect of the Capitol, Mr. Ayers is re-sponsible for overseeing the well-being of the buildings and structures that Americans under-stand as icons of American history including: the House and Senate Congressional Office Buildings, the Capitol Visitor Center, the Li-brary of Congress, the U.S. Supreme Court, the Thurgood Marshall Federal Judiciary Build-ing and the crown jewel of the portfolio the United States Capitol. Additionally, the care and improvement of more than 570 acres of grounds are under the supervision of the Ar-chitect of the Capitol. During his tenure, Mr. Ayers oversaw the restoration of the U.S. Capitol Dome, a major undertaking that repaired and restored the most recognizable symbol of liberty and de-mocracy in the world. The dome was com-pleted under budget and ahead of schedule. Other notable projects under Mr. Ayer’s tenure include the Ulysses S. Grant Memorial project, as well as the launch of the Cannon House Office Building renewal. The Legislative Branch Appropriations Sub-committee has come to depend on Stephen and his team for their hard work and profes-sionalism. As Mr. Ayers departs his post; the leadership, dedication, and bright smile he brought to work day in and day out will be missed. I wish Stephen and his wife Jennifer, all the best in this next phase of their lives.

HONORING THE ASIAN AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND MS. JANICE RYBA FOR THEIR EXEM-PLARY SERVICE 
HON. PETER J. VISCLOSKY 
OF INDIANA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 2, 2018 Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, it is with sin-cere admiration that I recognize the Asian American Medical Association, which will host its 42nd Annual Gala on Saturday, November 10, 2018, at Avalon Manor in Merrillville, Indi-ana. Each year, the Asian American Medical Association pays tribute to prominent, out-standing citizens and organizations for their contributions to the community. In recognition of their efforts, these honorees are awarded the prestigious Crystal Globe Award. The Asian American Medical Association has been a tremendous asset to Northwest In-diana. Its members have dedicated them-selves to providing quality medical services to the residents of Northwest Indiana and have served their communities through many cul-tural, scholastic, and charitable endeavors. At this year’s Annual Gala, the Asian Amer-ican Medical Association will present the Crys-tal Globe Award to one of Northwest Indiana’s finest citizens, Ms. Janice Ryba, JD, MJ, MHA. Janice has worked for over thirty years in the healthcare field in Northwest Indiana, primarily within the Community Healthcare System. In 2007, her extensive experience and exemplary leadership led to her being named Chief Executive Officer of Saint Mary Medical Center in Hobart, Indiana. Under Ms. Ryba’s direction, Saint Mary Medical Center has seen immense success and been recog-nized for its innovation. Recently, Saint Mary’s incorporated a brand new surgical pavilion, in-tensive care unit, and a six-story patient tower that features private patient rooms with the most up-to-date technology. Additionally, Saint Mary’s has expanded services in Porter Coun-ty with the new Valparaiso Health Center. Under Ms. Ryba’s leadership, providing com-passionate care with the finest technology is the goal of the organization, and she and the talented staff at Saint Mary’s continue to go above and beyond. For her lifetime of service, she is truly worthy of the prestigious honor be-stowed upon her. Ms. Ryba has also given much of her time and efforts to numerous organizations in Northwest Indiana and throughout the state in-cluding the Quality of Life Council, American Red Cross of Northwest Indiana, and the Indi-ana Hospital Association Council on Hospital Governance, to name a few. Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in com-mending the members of the Asian American Medical Association as well as this year’s Crystal Globe Award recipient, Ms. Janice Ryba. For her dedication to her outstanding career in the medical field and her remarkable service to the community of Northwest Indi-ana, Janice Ryba is worthy of the highest praise. f 
HONORING AMAGDA PEREZ WITH CALIFORNIA’S THIRD DISTRICT WOMAN OF THE YEAR AWARD 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 2, 2018 Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Amagda Perez as a woman of the year. She is an instructor at the UC Davis School of Law and a committed advocate for the legal rights of immigrants. As co-director of the Immigration Law Clinic at UC Davis and as an attorney with the California Rural Legal Assistance Foundation, she has extensive ex-perience working with immigrants of varied na-tionalities and other marginalized communities. Professor Perez brings to her work a wealth of experience and expertise in immigration and poverty law, allowing her to successfully advo-cate for some of our community’s most vulner-able. In her work at the UC Davis Immigration Law Clinic, Professor Perez supervises law students in the preparation of deportation de-fense cases. This work is important both in its advocacy for the rights of immigrants as well as the invaluable education and experience it provides for future immigration attorneys. Her work mentoring the next generation of legal scholars and advocates is of critical impor-tance to shaping the future of our society. The generosity Professor Perez shows in lending her time, knowledge, and experience to her students, and to those in need of representa-tion, is truly worthy of recognition. f 
CONGRATULATING THE NORTH COUNTRY PRENATAL/PERINATAL COUNCIL ON ITS 30TH ANNIVER-SARY 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 2, 2018 Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and recognize the North Country Pre-natal/Perinatal Council on its 30th Anniversary. Founded in 1988, the North Country Pre-natal/Perinatal Council (NCPPC) became the first perinatal network in New York State, serv-ing Jefferson, Lewis, and St. Lawrence Coun-ties. Since then, the NCPPC has worked hard to bolster maternal and family health by devel-oping a number of services and programs to improve access to this crucial form of care. As the regional coordinating council for maternal and child health issues, the NCPPC also man-ages grants for teen pregnancy prevention, community enrollment in insurance programs, Healthy Families Jefferson County, and a fam-ily resource center. As a result of the NCPPC’s persistent outreach and dedication, our North Country women, children, and fami-lies can continue to access the care they need. On behalf of New York’s 21st district, I want to congratulate the North Country Prenatal/ Perinatal Council and their dedicated employ-ees on their 30th anniversary. We are thankful for their service to our local communities, and we look forward to watching them continue to thrive for many years to come.

IN RECOGNITION OF ANDREW CHAPEL UNITED METHODIST CHURCH 
HON. ROBERT J. WITTMAN 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 2, 2018 Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Andrew Chapel United Methodist Church, of Montross, Virginia on their 170th anniversary. The church was founded in 1848 when land was deeded from Joseph and Susan Lyell, and its name honors Bishop James O. Andrew who helped found the Southern branch of Methodism in the 1840’s. Originally located under a grove of oak trees, Andrew Chapel has been served by more than 58 clergy and is currently led by Rev. Kevin F. Elmore. Through the years, the congregation has seen many changes in facilities and programs, yet Andrew Chapel continues to leave an invalu-able impact on the Montross community. Cur-rently, Andrew Chapel has a congregation of over 100 members who show unwavering commitment to loving their neighbors in a Christ-like manner. They facilitate free health

clinics, deliver ‘‘meals on wheels’’ every month, help supply the local food pantry, do-nate gifts during the holidays to local families in need, and support scholarships to high school graduates pursuing higher education opportunities. Their vision statement, ‘‘Hope and grace for all God’s children through Christ,’’ is a fitting anthem that embodies all their efforts in bringing glory to God. Mr. Speaker, I pray for Christ’s guidance as the congregation comes together in this time of celebration and reflection. May God con-tinue to bless Andrew Chapel United Meth-odist Church as they spread the good news of the Gospel and live out Christ’s love in our community.

TRIBUTE TO CREOLA BLACKWELL 
HON. DAVID YOUNG 
OF IOWA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 2, 2018 Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Creola Blackwell on the occasion of her 100th birth-day. Our world has changed a great deal during Creola’s life. Since her birth, we have revolu-tionized air travel and walked on the moon. We have invented the television, cellular phones and the internet. We have fought in wars overseas, seen the rise and fall of Soviet communism and witnessed the birth of new democracies. Creola has lived through eight-een United States Presidents and twenty-two Governors of Iowa. In her lifetime, the popu-lation of the United States has more than tri-pled. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to represent Creola in the United States Congress and it is my pleasure to wish her a happy 100th birth-day. I invite my colleagues in the House of Representatives to join me in congratulating Creola Blackwell on reaching this incredible milestone and wishing her even more health and happiness in the years to come.

HONORING GLORIA DIAZ WITH CALIFORNIA’S THIRD DISTRICT WOMAN OF THE YEAR AWARD 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 2, 2018 Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Gloria Diaz as a woman of the year. She exemplifies the qualities of selfless serv-ice and possesses a deep desire to help oth-ers in the community. Her professional work and volunteerism demonstrates her commit-ment to improving her community. As a Clin-ical Service Manager for the Vacaville Police Department, Gloria has worked for more than two decades as a mental health clinician and care provider. She oversees more than twenty grants that provide funding to programs that are vital in assisting members in the commu-nity who need urgent care and aid during a crisis. In her leadership role at the Family Re-source Center in Vacaville, Gloria dedicates her time selflessly to assist hundreds of indi-viduals and families gain financial support and access to direct-need services. Each year through the Family Investigative Response Service Team and Youth Services Section, Gloria works to support internship opportuni-ties for college students to gain valuable expe-rience in the field of mental health counseling. Her role in putting together the successful and expanding Summer at City Hall program aimed at supporting students focused on ca-reers in public service exemplifies her fond-ness for community service. Gloria Diaz’s tire-less efforts and devotion to this program have been instrumental to its continuous success. Her hard work in helping those in need is in-spirational and demonstrates what it truly means to serve your community. f 
RECOGNIZING THE PASSING OF DAVID AYALA-ZAMORA 
HON. PRAMILA JAYAPAL 
OF WASHINGTON  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 2, 2018 Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize David Ayala-Zamora, who died on Wednesday, October 17, 2018. David’s pass-ing is a huge loss for the City of Seattle and the Pacific Northwest region. As a union orga-nizer and immigrant rights organizer, David was a true champion for justice. David was born into a middle-class family in El Salvador. During the 1980s, David was one quarter away from graduating with a degree in electrical engineering when he decided to put his studies on hold to organize with teachers during El Salvador’s civil war. He also worked for a government institute that managed pen-sions for public employees as the grievance secretary, often putting him in very challenging and dangerous situations. David’s visibility as a union leader and his calls to end the war eventually led to his arrest and torture by Salvadoran security forces. His early experiences being tortured shaped the core of his character and he brought that strength and resilience to everything he did. David described being tortured as ‘‘The best experience in my life. Being tortured is like running a marathon. It taught me how com-mitted I am in the struggle for justice. And it has fortified me in some ways, because you learn how much capacity you have in this body.’’ Forced into exile in the United States where he eventually became a U.S. citizen, David re-turned to organizing work in his new home. He was driven to continue this work, saying that ‘‘Those of us who were touched by people who gave everything for justice, we have to try to keep them alive and with us through the work we do.’’ David’s work continues to be felt across the Pacific Northwest region. He was one of the organizers who launched the day laborer orga-nizing project that became Casa Latina, which continues to advocate for immigrant workers’ rights. Many years later, he worked with me as the Organizing Director at OneAmerica, the organization that I founded and where I served as Executive Director for 11 years. David was a true partner to me, helping me to expand our organization across Washington State as we grew OneAmerica to be the state’s largest immigrant rights organization. David was ex-ceptional at seeing leadership qualities in ordi-nary people and helping them to develop that leadership to do extraordinary things. Thanks to his work, OneAmerica was able to strength-en power within underrepresented immigrant communities and win major policy victories from maintaining driver’s licenses for undocu-mented immigrants, to organizing for the cre-ation of Washington State’s first and only ma-jority-minority congressional district, and push-ing for a state Voting Rights Act. David also worked for many years at SEIU in Portland and Seattle, organizing low-wage workers to bring justice to the workplace; as the Field Director at Working Washington where he organized airport workers at the Se-attle-Tacoma International Airport to fight for fair wages and a safe workplace; and as the Organizing Director at Promise Arizona, orga-nizing around voting rights, civic participation, and health care. David is survived by his wife, Siovhan Sheri-dan Ayala, and his children, David Ayala- Lindeman, Margarita Anne Ayala-Sheridan, and Maura Ruth Ayala-Sheridan; his father, David Ayala-Dominguez; and five brothers and sisters, Ana Betty Ayala de Giron, Obed Edgardo Ayala-Zamora, Ruth Ayala-Zamora, Yani Ayala-Zamora, and Eliud Ulises Ayala- Zamora. David was a trusted advisor and partner to me in fighting for immigrant and worker jus-tice. His irrepressible laughter, his deep appre-ciation for life, and his hunger for justice has sustained and inspired so many across the Northwest and in El Salvador. A light has gone from our world, but David’s legacy shines brightly with all those he touched and all the movements he helped build. His lasting impact on the region will endure for many years to come.

COMMEMORATING 125TH ANNIVER-SARY OF LAKEWOOD FIRE DE-PARTMENT 
HON. TOM REED 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 2, 2018 Mr. REED. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to com-memorate the one hundred twenty-fifth anni-versary of the Lakewood Fire Department. In 1893, citizens of Lakewood joined to-gether to form the Lakewood Bucket Brigade. Neighbors and friends intent on preserving the safety of their community set the foundation for more than a century of service to come. Dedicated to protecting its citizens, the vil-lage of Lakewood was covered by not one, but two fire companies for nearly forty years. Lakewood Hook and Ladder Co. No. 1, later known as Lakewood Hose Co. No. 1, was formed in 1899. Through generous donations from J.W. Packard, the Lakewood firefighters received land for a new fire hall and 1915 Model T Ford Chemical Fire engine. In 1924, Lakewood’s second fire company, known as the Lakewood Chemical Co. Inc., was formed. In 1964 the Lakewood Hose Co. No. 1 and the Lakewood Chemical Co. merged to be-come the present day Lakewood Fire Co. Inc. Over the years, the Lakewood Fire Depart-ment has grown in size and expanded in their capabilities. By adding marine rescue units, heavy rescue vehicles, ambulances, and lad-der trucks, the Lakewood Fire Department has adapted to meet the safety needs of their community. Construction and later renovation of a training center has ensured Lakewood firefighters are well prepared for the dangers they may face in the line of duty. One hundred twenty-five years of service to the community is certainly a cause for celebra-tion. I congratulate the Lakewood Fire Depart-ment for their impressive record of hard work and look forward to many more years of them keeping our community safe. Given the above, I ask that this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations and join me to celebrate the Lakewood Fire Department’s one hundred twenty-five years of service.

HONORING THE 150TH ANNIVER-SARY OF FIRST BAPTIST CHURCH IN PORTAGEVILLE, MO 
HON. JASON SMITH 
OF MISSOURI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 2, 2018 Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor First Baptist Church of Portageville, Missouri on the occasion of its 150th Anniversary. The church was founded on November 4th of 1868, when a small group in Portageville organized around a collective sense of faith and worship. The original congregation met in a log building erected in the 1850’s, later mov-ing into the local masonic lodge, which they shared with the freemasons. Since the early 1900’s, First Baptist Church has met in one of three buildings at its current location. First Baptist Church has the distinction of being the oldest church in the membership of the New Madrid Baptist Association, which is composed of the Southern Baptist congrega-tions in New Madrid and Pemiscot Counties. Today, the church has 306 members and is involved in local and nationwide missions. The church provides Bibles for distribution through the local RAIN (Reaching All In Need) Food Ministry, and also hosts weekly meetings for foster parent training. For continuing its work of proclaiming the Good News of Jesus Christ through 150 years of change and challenge, it is my great pleas-ure to honor First Baptist Church today before the United States House of Representatives.

TRIBUTE TO ELLA MAE WRIGHT 
HON. JOHN J. DUNCAN, JR. 
OF TENNESSEE  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 2, 2018 Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, Ella Mae Wright passed away in Knoxville, Tennessee on September 27th, at the age of 101. She was a great wife, mother, business woman, and all-around good citizen of the type that has made this country great. Mrs. Wright and her husband J.B. were married for 67 years. They founded Wright’s Cafeteria which still today is one of Knoxville’s most popular eating establishments. It was once described in a Knoxville newspaper as my ‘‘favorite restaurant.’’ Mrs. Wright’s pride and joy were her three children, David, Janice, and Calvin, and her seven grandchildren and twelve great-grand-children. She could often be found in the Cafeteria, greeting customers, most of whom she consid-ered as longtime friends. She was always smiling and offering encouraging words to ev-eryone. During her 101 years, she lived her Chris-tian faith every day and touched thousands of lives in good and positive ways. This Country is a better place today because of the life Ella Mae Wright led. I wanted my colleagues and others to know about this good woman and great American. HONORING GINA TAYLOR WITH CALIFORNIA’S THIRD DISTRICT WOMAN OF THE YEAR AWARD HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 2, 2018 Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Gina Taylor as a woman of the year. She is committed to serving children through-out her community and devotes her time to many volunteer organizations. As president of the Willows Unified School District Board she works with other board members to ensure the school district provides a safe and engaging learning environment where each student has the opportunity to realize their full potential, develop respect and tolerance for others, and ultimately become a productive member of the community. Ms. Taylor is an integral part of realizing the school district’s mission of pre-paring today’s students for tomorrow’s chal-lenges. The time she devotes to the school board is a true testament to how much she values education. Ms. Taylor was also a founding member of The Painted Ladies, a group that worked to fill the gaps in school budgets by cleaning and painting classrooms throughout the district. This work helped to provide a positive learning environment for countless students. She has also given her time volunteering for the Clover 4–H Club, the Glenn County 4–H Council, the Willows High Ag Boosters organization, and the Sober Grad event. Ms. Taylor is a dedicated community servant who can be depended upon to find a positive approach to each objective she pur-sues. Her accomplishments throughout Glenn County are truly remarkable.

CONSTITUENT COMMENTS ON SOBER LIVING HOME PROBLEMS 
HON. DANA ROHRABACHER 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 2, 2018 Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, I rise again regarding the hearing held by the Judici-ary Subcommittee on the Constitution and Civil Justice on September 28, 2018, on the issue of sober living homes. At that hearing, I had the privilege of testifying in support of my bill, H.R. 5724, to restore local oversight over sober living homes. As part of my testimony, I submitted to the Subcommittee letters from many of my constituents about problems with sober living homes caused by current federal law preventing appropriate local oversight. For the benefit of my colleagues and the American people, I include in the R
ECORD the eighth group of these constituent letters below: 
These are examples of what our neighbor-hood has had to endure since the Sober liv-ing home has opened in our neighborhood. As some of the new tenants moved in they in-troduced themselves as a bunch of college students. These tenants moved out within two weeks. We believe this was a ploy by [REDACTED] get the start in the neighbor-hood without attracting attention. Since they moved in, our neighborhood has had to put up with cars parked illegally up and down the street. When confronted, the ten-ants of the house use profanity and ex-tremely rude language and gestures. The neighborhood is on constant alert due to activity on our street and in and out of the house all hours of the night and day. Specifically, one-night last week a tenant walked out with a backpack around 1:00 a.m. and met with a stranger who was dropped off in our neighborhood earlier. The two were observed cooking heroin. The police were called and showed up. The two ran off along with a third person waiting in the sober liv-ing house back yard. When the police arrived this person and the one doing the drugs went home to home trying to get into houses. All of this was verified and collaborated via the many cameras in the neighborhood. One ve-hicle kept at the house, which is usually parked on the street, appears to be a drop point. People drive up and place something in the trunk and later a tenant will pick up whatever has been dropped off and bring it into the house. Our entire neighborhood has turned into a place where we do not feel safe. Our children must call before they come home so we can escort them into the house. The house has two aggressive pit bulls who have gotten out and pinned a neighbor inside her car unable to leave. When animal control arrived, the dog was put in the house and one tenant said to the officer it’s not my dog and left. These are examples of what our neighbor-hood has been dealing with. Some other con-cerns are the property values as several long time homeowners are already talking about selling to get away from the element that has moved in. This home in question is less than 1000 feet from a school. The school has been notified and parents that drop off their kids for school will be notified about this house. This can negatively affect the attend-ance of the school. The local police say there is nothing they can do, the city council tell us there is noth-ing we can do, this is our neighborhood and should not be driven out because of greed, or loopholes in the laws and insurance scams. We would hope Congress would give the local city’s authority to regulate and set rules for these kind of houses, and the ability to shut them down for illegal activity. LESSTAIT, Huntington Beach, California. 
My parents purchased their home in Hun-tington Beach, CA in 1977. I grew up in Hun-tington Beach, went to college and returned to the city to build my life. I purchased my residence in Huntington Beach in 2000. My family has loved living in Huntington Beach. However, our lives drastically changed in the last year. The couple that lived next door to my par-ents purchased their home 41 years ago as original owners. They raised three children in the home like my parents. They unfortu-nately passed away recently, and their chil-dren sold the home in November 2017. For months the home was under construction, but my parents didn’t think much of it. Then earlier this year we noticed the neighbor had a large white commercial style van outside, installed a fire sprinkler system with a red bell above the front door, and divided the bonus room into two rooms. We discovered from the person renovating the home that instead of a large family, it was going to house single people. The property records show the home was purchased by a lawyer representing a LLC business and that LLC business was owned by a business called [RE-DACTED]. We assume it is a sober living home for men, but it may be some other type of facility operated by [REDACTED]. On February 24, 2018 was the first time I experienced a problem. I went over to visit my parents from 8:30 am to 9:30 am. I sat in a chair in the family room. We had the win-dows closed. I smelled a strong smoke smell in the home. I didn’t know where it was com-ing from. I left after one hour and had a headache for six hours after. From February 24, 2018 to April 8, 2018, I visited my parent’s home about ten times. Every time I visited I smelled smoke in the home, backyard and/or front yard and experi-ence health symptoms (burning eyes, coughing, shortness of breath, headache and/ or feeling of sickness). I did not smell smoke or experience health symptoms prior to Feb-ruary 24, 2018. I experienced these symptoms even with the operation of multiple HEPA filters purchased to get rid of smoke. On Easter Sunday, April 1, 2018, at about 10:30 pm I came to pick up some food. During the ten minutes I was at my parent’s home I coughed the entire time. I was not coughing before coming to the home and didn’t cough after I returned to my car.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD —Extensions of RemarksE1488 November 2, 2018 
There was some pollutant entering my par-ent’s home and garage from next door that caused me to cough. During this visit I didn’t smell smoke, so it may have been a different chemical coming from next door. I am very concerned about the health im-pacts of the second-hand smoke and chemi-cals I am being exposed to in my parent’s home. I filed a complaint with the City of Huntington Beach code enforcement on April 8, 2018 following my Easter Sunday experi-ence. Due to the symptoms my parents were experiencing, my mom contacted the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) and filed multiple complaints about the smoke; however, SCAQMD inspec-tion staff stated they cannot take action against a residence, even though the sober living home is a business. Typically, SCAQMD will issue a notice of violation for businesses causing air pollution and nui-sance. My parents also filed complaints with the City of Huntington Beach code enforce-ment. In addition, they have been filing com-plaints with the operator of the home, [RE-DACTED]. The operator has made small changes, but my family is still significantly impacted by the smoke and/or chemicals (a sweet smell presumably vapes from e-ciga-rettes) nearly 24 hours a day, every day. My parents are elderly, have medical con-ditions that are known to be exacerbated by smoke and chemicals (which are also covered under the Americans for Disabilities Act), and are constantly being exposed to indoor and outdoor air pollution from the smoke and chemicals originating from next door. I am worried about my parent’s health and if the exposure from the sober living home will cause premature death. My niece and nephew are toddlers and I am concerned about their health when they come visit their grand-parents. We smell the chemicals in the living room and kitchen where we spend most of our family time. We are unable to use bed-rooms in the home because those rooms are filled with air contaminants and are now un-suitable for sleeping. The sober living home next door has caused significant stress and caused emotional toll for my family. Second-hand smoke has proven health im-pacts and according to the Centers for Dis-ease Control ‘‘There is no risk-free level of second hand smoke exposure; even brief ex-posure can be harmful to health.’’ In addi-tion, the California Air Resources Board has identified second hand smoke as a ‘‘Toxic Air Contaminant’’. Reports are now coming out about the health impacts of e-cigarettes. In addition to having a sober living home next door to my parents, eight homes down the street is a detox home owned by [RE-DACTED]. The neighbor of this home is the child of another original family in the neigh-borhood. The current family has young chil-dren and has been negatively impacted by the detox home from smoking, bad language, and too many vehicles parking. In addition, the parents have found needles at the local park, so their children no longer visit the park. In the last couple months, I have noticed groups of people standing on the curb in my condo complex smoking. In eighteen years of living at my residence, I have never seen this before and the general population smoking rates in California are decreasing. I would not be surprised if there is a detox or sober living home in my condo complex, but my homeowner association says they are ‘‘not allowed to ask.’’ The property next to mine is currently on the market and I have de-cided if a detox or sober living home moves next door, I will sell my property and ‘‘cash out.’’ I do not want to handle the stress of another detox or sober living home. Yesterday, I was driving down [RE-DACTED]. (a major street in Huntington Beach). In a one mile stretch between [RE-DACTED], I saw three addiction treatment centers on one side of the road. Most likely each one of them has a network of detox and sober living homes nearby. Huntington Beach is now known on the Internet as the national ‘‘Rehab Rivera.’’ Huntington Beach property values are going to be drastically impacted. Realtor Magazine published an article on October 17, 2014, stating there is an eight to 17 percent reduction in home values when homes are within one-eighth of a mile from a residen-tial treatment center. When my parents at-tempt to sell their home and they disclose there is sober living home next door and a detox home eight homes down the street, it is common sense that the home will have a lower value. If they don’t disclose the loca-tion of the homes, they can be sued by the buyer for non-disclosure. It is a lose-lose sit-uation for the large number of families that have detox and sober living homes in their neighborhood. When the health insurance runs out or a person is kicked out for breaking the house rules, they are left on the sidewalk. Many of these people become homeless since they don’t have the money to pay for transpor-tation home. In addition, when addicts re-lapse they can commit crimes to get money for the next fix. I have noticed a significant increase in number of homeless people in the city and heard reports from neighbors of an increase property crime. Huntington Beach used to pride itself as being one of the safest cities in America and that was a major rea-son my family chose to live in this commu-nity. The sober living home next door to my par-ents has totally changed my family’s quality of life. Detox and sober living homes should not be in residential areas. They should not be able to destroy other residents’ health, quality of life, and property values. In addi-tion, Huntington Beach should only have the necessary facilities to serve our local popu-lation. P

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE AND SERVICE OF MR. FIRMAN BALZA 
HON. MIKE GALLAGHER 
OF WISCONSIN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 2, 2018 Mr. GALLAGHER. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in honor of the life, legacy, and service of Green Bay native, Mr. Firman Balza. Mr. Firman Balza was one of America’s last surviving servicemen from the infamous attack on Pearl Harbor. Answering the call from his country, Firman signed up for the 34th Divi-sion of the U.S. Naval Reserves in Green Bay in 1940 at the age of 17. He entered the Navy a few months later and was assigned to the USS Maryland in April of 1941. The USS Maryland would leave for Pearl Harbor in July of 1941; Firman was aboard the vessel as a gunner’s mate first-class at the time of the at-tacks. The morning of December 7, 1941, Firman was preparing for Mass when he saw the first Japanese bombers flying overhead. Mass that morning would have been aboard the USS Oklahoma. The USS Oklahoma was moored next to the USS Maryland in the harbor when it suffered major damage and capsized. Firman bravely ran into the face of danger and took up arms as he defended the base with anti-aircraft guns. He later helped pull his de-ceased brothers-in-arms from the sunken ship. Four hundred-sixty men perished on the Okla- homa that day, and the Maryland lost five. During the four days following the attacks, Firman and his fellow soldiers rescued 32 men from the hull of the Oklahoma. Firman contin-ued his brave service to the country for three years on the USS Maryland participating in Guadalcanal, the Battle of Tarawa, and the Battle of Kwajalein Atoll. After the war, Firman was assigned to the USS Bayfield APA 33 and was sent to the Marshall Islands for atom-ic bomb tests at Bikini Atoll. On February 7, 1947, he was discharged from the Navy after six years and seven days on active duty. Firman was one of more than 16 million or-dinary people who did extraordinary acts dur-ing World War II. His willingness to begin sharing his story in 2003 at the age of 80 al-lowed many across Wisconsin, including stu-dents across northeast Wisconsin, to hear his account of that day. It was in 2003 that he first visited the Punch Bowl Cemetery in Hawaii and realized he wanted to be a voice to tell part of the story of those 2,335 servicemen and women who perished on that day of in-famy. If Firman left one message with all he spoke to, it was ‘‘Truly, man has got to learn to get along with each other.’’ Mr. Balza was 95 when he passed away on October 10, 2018. He was born September 25, 1923, to Theophile and Mary Balza, the

youngest of 11 sons. On April 23, 1949, he married Nathalie M. Larscheid. He was a true lover of the outdoors; he enjoyed camping with his family and hunting and fishing with his brother-in-law, Carlton Larscheid. He was very proud of becoming a licensed pilot at the age of 63. Words cannot justly thank Mr. Balza for his many years of service to our country. A treas-ure for a community and nation Mr. Balza can-not be replaced. May his service, dedication, and sacrifice be remembered by a grateful na-tion and all who knew him.

HONORING EMMA GREEN WITH CALIFORNIA’S THIRD DISTRICT WOMAN OF THE YEAR AWARD 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 2, 2018 Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Emma Green as a woman of the year. She is passionately devoted to improving her community both through her career and volunteerism. While professionally Emma has had a stellar career at Charter Systems, Inc. the financial services company she owned which just celebrated its 30th Anniversary, she is more likely to be recognized by the under-served in our community for the countless hours of volunteer service providing and deliv-ering meals. One of Emma’s passions is feed-ing the needy by running the Community Meal Program at the Church of the Epiphany where she serves over 350 meals per week. Not only do they serve meals, but she coordinates with other service providers to bring medical, den-tal, and transportation services to those in need. Ms. Green’s history of service also in-cludes her time as President of Vaca Arts, serving on Boards of the Boys & Girls Club, performing vocational rehabilitation and job placement for the disabled, serving as a liai-son to Travis Air Force Base Airmen, working with the Vacaville Community Outreach Pro-gram, and donating her time to many other service organizations where she is always the first to help. The significant positive impact Ms. Green has had on this community cannot be overstated, which makes her extremely worthy of this recognition.

TRIBUTE TO PATRICIA AND LARRY FOLLMANN

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 2, 2018 Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor Patricia and Larry Follmann of Massena, Iowa on the very special occasion of their 50th wedding anni-versary. They celebrated their anniversary on September 22, 2018. Patricia and Larry’s lifelong commitment to each other and their family truly embodies Iowa values. As they reflect on their 50th anni-versary, I hope it is filled with happy memo-ries. May their commitment grow even strong-er, as they continue to love, cherish, and honor one another for many years to come. Mr. Speaker, I commend this great couple on their 50th year together and I wish them many more. I ask that my colleagues in the United States House of Representatives join me in congratulating them on this momentous occasion. CALLING FOR RECOGNITION OF MILITARY FUNERAL HONOR GUARDS HON. ANDRE´CARSON 
OF INDIANA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 2, 2018 Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to draw attention to an important issue facing our service members and veterans. According to the Department of Veterans Af-fairs, over 500,000 veterans are dying each year. Under a law passed in 2000, many of these men and women qualify for military hon-ors at their funerals, including a two-person honor guard. These honor guards perform an impressive ceremony that includes folding and presenting the flag of the United States and playing Taps. This demonstration of our na-tion’s unceasing appreciation is incredibly im-portant to family, friends, and the entire vet-erans community. The Indiana National Guard, like in other states, strives to provide funeral teams when-ever possible. Unfortunately, with so many veterans passing each year, there are too few men and women prepared to render honors. Service members and veterans in my home-town of Indianapolis recognized this shortage and organized the Indy Metropolitan Military Honor Guard to meet the need, averaging 400 funerals per year and amassing over 9,600 man hours and 56,000 miles traveled. Those who serve in our Armed Forces never do so for accolades or honors. Yet, we honor them with medals and ribbons to recog-nize their service and tell the story of their achievements. In Indiana, the National Guard decorates funeral team members and the Metro Military Honor Guard provides a ribbon to be worn by its participants. Yet, this is not the case across much of the country. Service members and veterans who serve on honor guards are providing a valuable service and should be decorated for their contribution. Mr. Speaker, today I’m pleased to recognize all the service members and veterans who serve on honor guards across the country. I call on all states to follow Indiana’s example and adopt a ribbon to recognize these dedi-cated individuals.

RECOGNIZING ELGIN LOWE 
HON. ERIC SWALWELL 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 2, 2018 Mr. SWALWELL of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the dutiful work of my former colleague, Mr. Elgin Lowe, on the oc-casion of his receiving the South Alameda County NAACP 40th Annual Service Award. Elgin joined the Alameda County District At-torney’s Office in 1996 after receiving his Bachelor of Arts in History from UC Santa Barbara followed by his Juris Doctor from UC Hastings College of Law in San Francisco. Elgin’s accomplishments over the course of the last twenty-two years are innumerable. There are, however, a few achievements I will mention for the extraordinary impact they had on our community. In 2011, Elgin began pros-ecuting cases that resulted from gang violence on the south side of our county. His work re-sulted in the successful prosecution of several high-profile murders and brought resolutions and a restorative sense of justice to several victims and families whose cases were pre-viously considered ‘‘unsolvable.’’ Elgin’s deep understanding of criminal pros-ecutions is sought whenever the county is in need of someone to train newer attorneys in the areas of case investigation, testimony, trial preparation, and the unique set of challenges that prosecutions of gang members bring to the courtroom. Our community is only in debt to Elgin not only for the work he completes in and around the courtroom, but also for the countless hours he volunteers in the community at large. He has prioritized speaking to at-risk youth about the perils that await those who enter the crimi-nal realm or affiliate with a gang. Elgin has also actively participated with our local Re-gional Occupation Program center and mentored first-year law students in Berkeley’s Boalt Hall moot court program. Elgin draws his support from his amazing family. His wife, Briggitte, also works at the Al-ameda County District Attorney’s Office, and together they have two wonderful children, their son Kendall, and daughter Kori. It goes without saying that Elgin has made his mother Evelyn quite proud. I want to thank Elgin Lowe for the contribu-tions he has made to the 15th Congressional District and all of Alameda County. His work is consequential and appreciated. f 
HONORING GAIL FEINBERG WITH CALIFORNIA’S THIRD DISTRICT WOMAN OF THE YEAR AWARD 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 2, 2018 Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Gail Feinberg as a woman of the year. She is always finding ways to enrich the lives of those in Solano County. As a medical professional, Ms. Feinberg has a wealth of knowledge and skills to bring to bear on any issue. Having now served for two years as the Chair of Primary Care for Touro University, her continued excellence and tireless work to train medical students in providing care for our underserved populations has been indispen-sable to our community. Additionally, in spite of the demanding nature of her position, Ms. Feinberg is persistent in her willingness to go above and beyond, as demonstrated by her dedication to volunteering at a student-run free clinic. Here her valuable insight and tenacity became so integral to the mission of the clinic that she was quickly asked to take over as medical director. As a result, Ms. Feinberg provides much needed free medical services to those in need. She also manages to find the time to volunteer teaching nursing stu-dents and work with a diabetes research pro-gram. Ms. Feinberg is diligent in her work, generous with her time, and passionate about serving others. She is a dedicated community servant and truly worthy of this recognition.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor NASA’s Kepler Space Telescope on its retirement and to commend the many thou-sands of NASA personnel who designed and maintained Kepler and analyzed data received from it.

Kepler has run out of fuel, and will be retired in its current safe orbit, away from Earth. ‘‘As NASA’s first planet-hunting mission, Kepler has wildly exceeded all our expecta-tions and paved the way for our exploration and search for life in the solar system and be-yond,’’ said Thomas Zurbuchen, Associate Ad-ministrator of NASA’s Science Mission Direc-torate in Washington. ‘‘Not only did it show us how many planets could be out there, it sparked an entirely new and robust field of re-search that has taken the science community by storm. Its discoveries have shed a new light on our place in the universe, and illumi-nated the tantalizing mysteries and possibili-ties among the stars.’’ Kepler showed us the diversity of planets in our galaxy, and concluded that 20 to 50 per-cent of the stars visible in the night sky are likely to have small, possibly rocky planets similar in size to Earth. Many of these could possibly sustain life. ‘‘When we started conceiving this mission 35 years ago we didn’t know of a single planet outside our solar system,’’ said the Kepler mission’s founding principal investigator, Wil-liam Borucki, now retired from NASA’s Ames Research Center and the recipient of the 2013 United States National Academy of Sciences’ Henry Draper Medal for his work with Kepler and the 2015 recipient of the Shaw Prize in Astronomy. ‘‘Now that we know planets are everywhere, Kepler has set us on a new course that’s full of promise for future generations to explore our galaxy.’’ Kepler’s retirement doesn’t mean the end of its contributions to our scientific knowledge. Future missions will build on its results and scientists will mine the data Kepler collected for years to come. NASA’s Ames Research Center in Califor-nia’s Silicon Valley manages the Kepler and K2 missions for NASA’s Science Mission Di-rectorate. Mr. Speaker, I’m very proud to represent NASA Ames and its extraordinary programs that advance our knowledge of our planet and beyond. I ask the entire House of Representa-tives to honor Kepler and each person and or-ganization who contributed to its extraordinary success.

HONORING MR. JEFF STRACK WITH THE 2018 DISTINGUISHED CITIZEN AWARD 
HON. PETER J. VISCLOSKY 
OF INDIANA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 2, 2018 Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, it is with great respect and admiration that I take this time to recognize the recipient of the 2018 Distinguished Citizen Award, presented annu-ally by the Boy Scouts of America Calumet Council. To commemorate this special occa-sion, the organization will host a celebratory event on Wednesday, November 7, 2018, at the Center for Visual and Performing Arts in Munster, Indiana. For 26 years, the Boy Scouts of America Calumet Council has presented the Distin-guished Citizen Award to individuals whose selfless efforts have tremendously impacted their communities in Northwest Indiana and across the state. This year, the Boy Scouts of America Calumet Council will honor Mr. Jeff Strack. In May of 2016, Jeff Strack was appointed President and Chief Executive Officer of Indi-ana Grocery Group/Strack & Van Til. As a third-generation head of the company, Jeffs legacy began with his fondest memories of shadowing his father as he worked tirelessly to keep Strack & Van Til successful. After eighth grade, Jeff was officially hired into the company, eventually working his way through every department within the store before leav-ing for college. After obtaining his master’s de-gree, Jeff embarked on a journey with Strack & Van Til that helped him learn every aspect of the business, rightfully earning his way to leading the company. Almost a year after Jeff’s appointment as President and Chief Executive Officer, he was faced with challenges that to many would have seemed insurmountable. In 2017, after its parent company, Central Grocers, filed for bankruptcy, Strack & Van Til was forced to shut down numerous stores. However, Jeff was determined to save the family business that has served as an economic driver in Northwest Indiana for almost six decades. After he and a group of investors formed Indi-ana Grocery Group and successfully pur-chased back Strack & Van Til, Mr. Strack vowed to keep it a family-owned business. Jeff fought for the business and for the jobs of many individuals by securing twenty locations in communities throughout Northwest Indiana. In addition, Mr. Strack’s many contributions to the community have supported local schools, military, first responders, and families in need. Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in com-mending the steadfast leadership and dedica-tion of Mr. Jeff Strack. Mr. Strack’s family business continues to serve as a cornerstone of Northwest Indiana, and their continued charitable efforts and service in our local com-munities are to be admired. Jeff is undeniably deserving of the 2018 Distinguished Citizen Award. His exceptional leadership and com-mitment to Northwest Indiana will have a posi-tive impact on generations to come. f 
RECOGNIZING SARAH CARPENTER OF BURLINGTON, VERMONT 
HON. PETER WELCH 
OF VERMONT  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 2, 2018 Mr. WELCH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Ms. Sarah Carpenter of Burlington, Vermont for her distinguished career in afford-able housing and her tireless dedication to im-proving the lives of Vermonters. At the end of 2018, Sarah will retire as Ex-ecutive Director of the Vermont Housing Fi-nance Agency (VHFA) after 20 years of lead-ing that organization. Sarah’s extraordinary ca-reer has created opportunities for thousands of Vermonters to achieve their dream of own-ing a home. Since its inception in 1974, VHFA’s main goal has been to finance low- cost and flexible mortgages to individuals seeking affordable housing. VHFA has helped over 29,000 Vermonters and their families to purchase primary residences. Sarah leads a team of 38 employees that provides diverse and innovative services. They finance mort-gages, coordinate rental housing programs, analyze housing market data, and inform state housing policy. During Sarah’s tenure, the vol-ume of VHFA mortgages provided to Vermonters grew by $1.3 billion. Sarah and VHFA’s leadership has influence far beyond Vermont’s borders. In 2000, VHFA successfully campaigned for Congress to in-crease the caps on the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Program and private activity bonds. Additionally, she advocated for state tax credit programs that supplement the federal funds due to Vermont’s dire need for a greater sup-ply of affordable rental housing. Sarah’s contributions to the housing com-munity began long before her time at VHFA. From 1983 to 1998, she served as the Execu-tive Director of Cathedral Square Corporation, an organization that has become a national model in providing service-enriched housing for older adults and people with special needs. Sarah has also served in leadership roles on numerous boards including Leading Age, the National Council of State Housing Agen-cies, the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston, and Fletcher Allen Healthcare (now the Uni-versity of Vermont Medical Center). It comes as no surprise that Sarah has been the recipient of a number of awards in-cluding the Government Service Award from NeighborWorks America and the Vermont YWCA Susan B. Anthony A ward for Woman of the Year. Sarah is a native of Burlington, Vermont, and a graduate of University of Vermont and Harvard University. We are in the midst of a housing crisis across this country. Chronic homelessness is alarmingly high, people are paying an ever-in-creasing portion of their paychecks on hous-ing, and homeownership is out of reach for many. Despite the challenges, Sarah Car-penter and her colleagues throughout the state of Vermont have continued to make progress through innovative approaches and deep collaboration. Sarah has left her mark on the housing community in Vermont and the lives of many who have benefited from her good work. Mr. Speaker, Sarah’s exceptional work on behalf of Vermont communities will surely be missed, and I wish her well in her retirement. f 
CELEBRATING THE CAREER OF MELVIN COOPER 
HON. DOUG COLLINS 
OF GEORGIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 2, 2018 Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Melvin Cooper, Direc-tor of Gainesville Parks and Recreation, who is retiring after 47 years of service with the city and 30 years as its Parks Director. In a letter to Gainesville’s Parks and Recre-ation Board, Mr. Cooper said, ‘‘From the time I was 12 years old I knew what I wanted to do and began to set my goals for what I have done for the last 47 years. I wanted to lead change, I wanted to be change, I wanted to work with people and make a difference.’’ Melvin Cooper was born in Moultrie and spent most of his childhood in Commerce, Georgia. In 1970, while he was a student at the University of Georgia, he completed an in-ternship for the Parks and Recreation Depart-ment. Mr. Cooper was first hired as a Program Coordinator and later held the role of Assistant Director for 16 years. During his tenure as Di-rector, the Gainesville Civic Center was ren-ovated, Lake Lanier hosted the 1996 Summer Olympics, and the Frances Meadows Aquatic Center—along with many other facilities— opened to the public. After leading the Parks and Recreation De-partment for three decades, Mr. Cooper an-nounced his retirement at a recent Board of Directors meeting. The search for a replace-ment will begin November 1, and Mr. Cooper will continue to serve as Director until May 31, 2019. During his career, which has spanned al-most half a century, Mr. Cooper helped im-prove the quality of life in our community and his contributions will benefit generations to come. I wish Mr. Cooper joyful years ahead in his retirement.

HONORING THE 200TH ANNIVER-SARY OF JEFFERSON COUNTY, MISSOURI 
HON. JASON SMITH 
OF MISSOURI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 2, 2018 Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Jefferson County, Missouri, created on December 8, 1818 by an ‘‘Act of the Territory,’’ uniting portions of St. Louis and Ste. Genevieve Counties. It was named for our nation’s third president, Thomas Jefferson, the father of the Louisiana Purchase which in-cluded the land that became Missouri. Jeffer-son County’s earliest settlers were French and they settled along the area’s many waterways that include the Mississippi River, the Mera-mec River and the Big River. Jefferson County is home to sites where ar-cheologists say mastodons roamed 12,000 years ago. Lead shot made in the county was used in the War of 1812 and there are 10 sites in Jefferson County on the National Reg-ister of Historic Places. Historical societies in local cities are dedicated to preserving their history with a county museum established in Festus as part of the 200th birthday celebra-tion. With its rich history and promise of progress, Jefferson County is a treasure that continues to be a vital part of Missouri’s econ-omy and future growth. I am proud to con-gratulate Jefferson County on its bicentennial today before the United States House of Rep-resentatives.

HON. JOHN GARAMENDI

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 2, 2018 Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Elta Barber as a woman of the year. She is committed to serving those in need both in her community and around the world. When she realized that her community lacked constructive activities for young people, she took the initiative to organize the ‘‘Youth Ex-plosion’’ event. In coordination with other com-munity leaders and faith-based organizations, she put on this quarterly program which gives youth in her community an opportunity to showcase their talents. Thanks to her dedica-tion to this project, over 100 young people participate in this program each quarter. Ms. Barber’s advocacy for young people ex-tends beyond her community into the rest of the world. She is a founding member of a pro-gram providing outreach and support to an or-phanage in Africa. Each year she works with other community leaders to host ‘‘To Tanzania with Love,’’ a fundraiser which helps provide crucial educational supplies and other essen-tials to children living in an orphanage in Tan-zania. She has provided devoted support to this organization as a member of the Board of Trustees for over 26 years. Ms. Barber is a skilled and passionate advocate who is an in-spiration to volunteers and leaders throughout her community. f

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 2, 2018 Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an educator in Bucks County, Pennsylvania who recently became a finalist in a national education grant contest. Jackie Rippert, a teacher at Neshaminy High School in Langhorne, becomes one step closer to the $100,000 education grant that is sponsored to fund meaningful projects in local schools and communities. If selected, Jackie plans on creating a ‘‘liv-ing classroom’’ that enables students to grow plants and cultivate produce. This is particu-larly beneficial for food pantries, who will ben-efit from the vegetables grown. It will also serve as a hands-on learning experience for students with special needs to gain valuable life skills. I applaud Jackie for her dedication to her students and our community. I wish her all the best in her quest for this important grant.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 2, 2018 Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Big Broth-ers Big Sisters of Central Iowa which is cele-brating 50 years of service to Des Moines and central Iowa area. Big Brothers Big Sisters of Central Iowa was established in 1968 and continues to have an important impact on the lives of children and families. The Big Brothers movement started in New York City in 1904. The Ladies of Charity, which befriended girls, formed around the same time. Both groups worked independently until 1977 when they joined forces to create Big Brothers Big Sisters. Big Brothers Big Sis-ters operates under the belief that inherent in every child is the ability to succeed and thrive in life. The Big Brothers Big Sisters of Central Iowa have been helping children reach their potential and realize new opportunities for their future. The overwhelming community support from volunteers, donors, and advo-cates is a true testament of their success. Mr. Speaker, I commend and congratulate Big Brothers Big Sisters of Central Iowa for their many years of dedicated and devoted service to children of Des Moines and Central Iowa. The Big Brothers Big Sisters staff and volunteers make a real difference by helping and serving others. It is with great honor that I recognize them today. I know that my col-leagues in the United States House of Rep-resentatives join me in applauding their ac-complishments and I wish them and staff con-tinued success in the future. f 
CELEBRATING HALL COUNTY’S BICENTENNIAL ANNIVERSARY 
HON. DOUG COLLINS 
OF GEORGIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 2, 2018 Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 200th anniversary of my home, Hall County, Georgia. Hall County is Northeast Georgia’s center for banking, industry, and health care. It was established on December 15, 1818 by the state legislature and was named in honor of Lyman Hall. Hall was one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence and served as a physician and Georgia governor. In its two-century history, Hall County has become home to many great attractions, in-cluding Lake Lanier, which has brought mil-lions of visitors to the area. Any discussion of Hall County begins with chicken, as Gaines-ville is the poultry capital of the world. Jesse Jewell, a Gainesville native, pioneered the vertically integrated poultry farming method that revolutionized the industry. Flowery Branch is home to the training complex of the Atlanta Falcons. Lula, the hometown of my wife, Lisa, is a heritage-minded community that welcomes the annual Railroad Days each spring. From north to south, east to west, those who call Hall County home know just how special it is from the beautiful lake to the foot-hills of Hall County area, where I was raised and still call home. I celebrate Hall County’s two centuries of rich history and wish the citi-zens generations of success that last long into the future.

TRUE HERO: SPECIALIST FIFTH CLASS CLARENCE E. SASSER 
HON. TED POE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 2, 2018 Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, today I would like to honor the heroism of Specialist Fifth Class Clarence E. Sasser of the United States Army. Specialist Fifth Class Clarence E. Sasser was a private in the 3rd Battalion, 60th Infantry Regiment, 9th Infantry Division when he earned the U.S. military’s highest decoration, the Medal of Honor, for his selfless and courageous acts on January 10, 1968, during the Vietnam War. As a combat medic in Vietnam, Specialist Sasser served our country above and beyond the call of duty. He is a hero among us. Clarence Eugene Sasser was born in 1947 in Chenango, Texas. Sasser was studying chemistry as a part-time student at the Univer-sity of Houston when he was drafted in 1967. Sasser completed a ten week course at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio to be a medical aid man. The 20 year old went to Vietnam in September 1967, assigned to the 3rd Bat-talion, 60th Infantry Regiment, 9th Infantry Di-vision. The division was sent to the Mekong Delta, in southwestern Vietnam. As the medic for 1st Platoon, Company A, Sasser would accompany the unit when it left base camp to go on patrols, missions or night-time ambushes. On January 10, 1968, what Sasser considers ‘‘the longest day of his life’’,

his company was on the third day of their search and destroy mission when Company A was sent out in 12 helicopters to a large, flooded rice paddy. The lead helicopter was hit with enemy fire and crashed, so the rest land-ed. More than 30 Americans were either im-mediately killed or wounded. Upon stepping off the helicopter, Sasser was shot through his right leg. Since the rice paddy was flooded with mud and water, Sasser found it easier to grab tufts of grass and rice plants to pull himself and glide through the paddy to render medical aid. It was faster than trying to walk, and being low made him less exposed to enemy fire. Sasser pulled one man to safety near an embankment that provided some cover and was going back when mortar fire landed about five feet from him, and shrapnel struck his back and left side just as he reached cover. Despite these inju-ries in addition to his legs being immobilized from injury, Sasser continued sliding through the rice paddy to answer fallen infantry sol-diers calling for ‘‘Doc’’. Into the afternoon and through the night, Sasser treated injuries until his supplies ran out, then continued going to soldiers calling for help when all he could offer was emotional support. Army helicopters were finally able to come into the area and the platoons were evacuated about 4 a.m., 18 hours after they first arrived in the rice paddy. President Richard Nixon presented 21 year old Sasser with the Medal of Honor on March 7, 1969, ‘‘for conspicuous gallantry and intre-pidity in actjon at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty,’’ according to the medal citation. ‘‘It’s confirmation to me that I did my job. And that’s how I had to deal with it,’’ Sasser said in an interview in 2011. ‘‘It was my job, and I don’t think what I did was above and beyond. I never have.’’ Following his military service, he attended Texas A&M University on a scholarship of-fered by then President James Earl Rudder in August 1969. After attending Texas A&M, he began working at an oil refinery for more than five years before going on to work at the United States Department of Veterans Affairs to continue to serve his country. On November 7, 2013, he was the eighth Texas Aggie to be added to Texas A&M University’s Medal of Honor Hall of Honor. During his speech at the ceremony, Sasser said ‘‘I am particularly proud that my Medal of Honor is for saving lives and not taking lives.’’ Specialist Sasser is also honored at the Brazoria County Courthouse in Angleton, Texas for his outstanding bravery. On Vet-erans’ day 2010, he was memorialized into the 40 foot ‘‘Ring of Honor’’ with a life-size portrait bronze sculpture of Sasser in a crouched run, carrying his medic bag while in action. Of the 246 Medals of Honor awarded during the Vietnam War, 20 were given to black serv-icemen. Of the 53 Vietnam War-era recipients still living, Sasser is the only black veteran. Mr. Speaker, we continue to honor Spe-cialist Sasser for his sacrifice and heroic ef-forts. He is a true warrior who went above and beyond, risking his own life to save others. We must ensure that our country’s veterans are not forgotten and are given due recognition of their bravery and sacrifice. And that’s just the way it is. HONORING DOROTHY JOHNSON WITH CALIFORNIA’S THIRD DIS-TRICT WOMAN OF THE YEAR AWARD 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 2, 2018 Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Dorothy Johnson as a woman of the year. She has spent her career as an educa-tor and established a reputation for her dedi-cation to community service. She serves on the executive board of the Solano County Re-tired Teachers Association, working to support measures that advance the financial security of retired educators and further safeguarding the state’s commitment to these educators. Dorothy is an active voice in pressing for issues affecting teachers and the public edu-cation system. She is instrumental in sup-porting the educational needs in her commu-nity and beyond. As a teacher for the Depart-ment of Defense Dependent Schools and the Department of Defense Education Activity, Dorothy has served and taught the children of military service members at the American mili-tary bases in Germany, Japan, and Taiwan. Additionally, she generously volunteers her time to help members of her community who are in need by supporting toy drives, fund-raisers, and assisting the Vacaville Police De-partment during their community outreach events. Dorothy Johnson’s generosity and vol-unteerism are an example for future leaders and her work has been vital in strengthening her community and supporting Solano County residents of all ages.

TRIBUTE TO CINDY LUNDY 
HON. DAVID YOUNG 
OF IOWA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 2, 2018 Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Cindy Lundy of Adair, Iowa for being selected as Guthrie County’s 2018 inductee into the Iowa 4–H Hall of Fame. Cindy has served as 4–H leader in Guthrie County for 25 years. She has assisted with community service projects such as cleaning up yards, sewing receiving blankets, and col-laborating with other 4–H clubs to provide ac-tivities during holidays and town celebrations. She has served on the Youth Committee Board as a Static Exhibit judge, Livestock Judging Committee, and the Food Stand Com-mittee. She is also active with her school dis-trict and church. Mr. Speaker, the example set by Cindy demonstrates the rewards of harnessing one’s talents and sharing them with the world. Her efforts embody the Iowa spirit and I am hon-ored to represent her, and Iowans like her, in the United States Congress. I know that all my colleagues in the United States House of Rep-resentatives will join me in congratulating Cindy Lundy for her achievement and wish her nothing but continued success. HONORING THE 200TH ANNIVER-SARY OF WAYNE COUNTY, MIS-SOURI HON. JASON SMITH 
OF MISSOURI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 2, 2018 Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the bicentennial birthday of Wayne County, Missouri in the beautiful foot-hills of the Ozarks. It was originally known as the ‘‘Great State of Wayne’’ because when it was established, it was bigger than some states and it was consolidated before Missouri even became a state. Wayne County was officially organized on December 11, 1818, named for Revolutionary War General ‘‘Mad’’ Anthony Wayne. Among its pioneer settlers are the families of Bollinger, Limbaugh, Seabaugh, Miller, Slinkard and the descendants of Francis Clark, who settled the Piedmont area in 1803. Civil War battles were fought there and Gen-eral William Hardee headquartered his Union Army in what is now the county seat of Green-ville. Once home to 90 one-room school houses, Wayne County now boasts two thriving con-solidated public school districts and 13,341 residents. Wayne County welcomes visitors to explore its outdoor playgrounds at Lake Wappapello, the Mingo Wildlife Refuge and Clearwater Lake. It is my great privilege to congratulate the people of Wayne County as they mark 200 years of pride and progress today before the United States House of Representatives.

HON. BRIAN K. FITZPATRICK 
OF PENNSYLVANIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 2, 2018 Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to recognize the 40th anniversary of a busi-ness in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, that pro-motes the health and wellbeing of our commu-nity, the Newtown Athletic Club. On Saturday, November 3, 2018, the New-town Athletic Club will host a night of celebra-tion and camaraderie. This evening will seek to celebrate physical and mental wellness, along with raising awareness and funding for ALS research through the organization’s part-ner charity, the NAC Have a Heart Founda-tion. To date, the NAC Have a Heart Founda-tion has raised nearly $2 million to find a cure for this disease. I applaud the leadership of Newtown Ath-letic Club owner and NAC Have a Heart founder, Jim Worthington, for his generosity and advocacy. Jim truly embodies community service and active citizenship. I’d also like to recognize Matt Bellina, whose activism on be-half of the ALS community is deeply inspiring. The Newtown Athletic Club is more than just a facility; it is cherished institution here in Bucks County.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor Marge and Steve Pierce of Oakland, Iowa on the very special occasion of their 50th wedding anni-versary.

RECOGNIZING PETE BUTLER 
HON. JEFF DENHAM 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 2, 2018 Mr. DENHAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Pete Butler for his dedicated service as a Wounded Warrior Fellow in my district of-fice. In 2002, Pete graduated from Sunset High School in Beaverton, Oregon. He soon found his calling and devoted his life to serving his country in the United States Army. Pete en-listed in 2007, serving two tours in Afghani-stan. He earned many commendations and accolades, including a Bronze Star, Purple Heart and a Combat Infantry Badge. After retiring from the U.S. Army in Novem-ber 2014, Pete settled down in Turlock, Cali-fornia with his wife, Stephanie, and children, PJ and Brayden. In 2015, he started work at Starbucks as a Store Assistant Manager. At the same time, he stayed busy attending classes at California State University of Stanislaus, where he intends to obtain his Bachelor’s of Science in Political Science. Driven by a desire to continue serving his country, Pete applied for a position with the Wounded Warrior Fellowship and joined our team. He served as a liaison to veterans’ com-munities in Stanislaus and San Joaquin coun-ties. Pete was a tremendous asset, advocating on behalf of these brave men and women. He helped provide strong oversight over the French Camp VA Hospital project, which will benefit veterans in our district and surrounding areas. In addition to his other duties, Pete played an integral role working with our flood control agencies, including the successful authoriza-tion of the Lower San Joaquin Chief’s Report. The project aims to reduce the overall flood risk for over 50,000 residents around the San Joaquin River in California’s Central Valley. Although Pete will be sorely missed by all, including the rest of the staff, Team Denham wishes him the best in his next endeavor. Mr. Speaker, please join me in congratu-lating Pete Butler on his new position and rec-ognizing him for his faithful service during his time with my office. HONORING CINDI UNGER WITH CALIFORNIA’S THIRD DISTRICT WOMAN OF THE YEAR AWARD HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 2, 2018 Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Cindi Unger as a woman of the year. She is passionately devoted to improving her community both through her career and vol-unteerism. Her inspiration and motivation to work and volunteer in the Senior Care industry comes from her grandparents and their spirit of hard work and sacrifice that they passed on to her. Since 1986, when she worked to help open one of the first care centers in California focused on individuals living with Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias, she has helped care providers, families, and the community understand and care for those suffering with the disease. Her work in my Senior Advisory Group, the Yolo Healthy Aging Alliance, and the Solano Senior Coalition has been essen-tial to my awareness and understanding of the critical issues facing our senior communities. As the co-chair of the Solano Walk to End Alz-heimer’s Planning Committee and a member of the Congressional Advocacy Group, Ms. Unger is no stranger to my office and provides invaluable insight to me and my staff on a reg-ular basis. The significant positive impact she has had on this community cannot be over-stated, and she is extremely worthy of this recognition.

DEPARTURE OF MATHEW WEIDINGER FROM THE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE STAFF 
HON. KEVIN BRADY 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 2, 2018 Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize a trusted advisor, a good friend, and by any standard one of the best to ever serve the House Ways and Means Com-mittee, Mr. Mathew Weidinger. With all of Matt’s insight into how this Com-mittee functions and his knowledge of its many storied traditions, it’d be easy to think he began his career under Chairman Fitzsimons when this Committee was founded in 1789, but that just goes to show how truly valuable Matt is around here. For over 25 years, Matt has played an im-portant role in the major accomplishments of this Committee. From each hearing, markup, and piece of legislation our Committee has led, Matt has been there, ready to serve and willing to go the extra mile to make sure the job not only gets done but done well. His name and reputation are nearly synonymous with the Ways and Means Committee. Serving five different GOP Chairmen—Ar-cher, Thomas, Camp, R
YAN, and B RADY —and being an integral part of our Human Re-sources and Social Security Subcommittees throughout his tenure, Matt’s voice and unpar-alleled attention to detail has helped shepherd through laws that have directly benefited the lives of millions of children and families. From foster care and adoption, to child support, dis-ability, and unemployment—especially the Personal Responsibility Work Opportunity Act and the Promoting Safe and Stable Families Act—it has always been about what is best for taxpayers and families. Most notably, Matt is our last connection to the successful 1996 welfare reforms that set consistent policies for non-citizens and led to the greatest increase in single mothers return-ing to work and decrease in poverty. We learned as a nation that in expecting more, more can be achieved, and we seek each day to build upon that success. When the Great Recession hit our nation, Matt again provided the focus on work and ex-pectation that was needed, reforming the un-employment insurance program in ways that will improve the success of the unemployed for decades to come. Any Member of this Committee going back almost three decades could tell story after story about Matt’s sharp intellect, incredible re-call, and dedication to serving the American people. Matt is a true patriot who could have picked a career in any field. Instead, he chose to serve. We are all so grateful for that choice. With the many demands from his busy schedule, Matt has never ceased being a mentor to dozens and dozens of staffers, all who today would testify that they are better at their jobs because of Matt. As I was first joining this Committee, out-going Chairman Bill Archer was singing Matt’s praises and advising me to seek his insight on welfare reform and the other myriad programs that make up our Committee’s work on Human Resources. Chairman Archer gave me good advice, and my respect and admiration for Matt has only grown throughout the years. I have turned to Matt for continued guidance and judgement as we’ve tackled historic issues like tax reform and health care. On behalf of our entire Committee, I want to express my deepest gratitude to Matt. For the countless late nights and early morning’s Matt spent here, I would like to especially thank Matt’s family, his wife, Jean, and his eight chil-dren JC, Andrew, Cara, Hannah, Erin, Joe, Mike, and Claire. I wish Matt and his entire family all the best as he starts the next chap-ter of his life. Our Committee will not be the same without Matt, but it will forever be a bet-ter place because of his service. f 
TRIBUTE TO SUSIE MEADE 
HON. DAVID YOUNG

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 2, 2018 Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Dr. Susie Meade, Superintendent of Winterset Community School District who has been named the 2018–2019 Superintendent of the Year by the School Administrators of Iowa. Dr. Meade has been superintendent of the Winterset district since 2012 and previously served as assistant superintendent at Ankeny Community Schools. She began her career in education as a secondary home economics teacher in Faribault, MN. This award is based on the Iowa Standards for School Leaders and focuses on a shared vision of leadership, safe efficient and effective learning, work with par-ents and community and a presence of fair-ness, integrity, and ethics. I applaud and congratulate Susie for her award and for providing the youth in Iowa’s Third Congressional district the education that they will need to be successful in the future. I am proud to represent her and the entire Winterset Community School District in the United States Congress. I know that my col-leagues will join me in congratulating Susie Meade and wishing her continued success in the future.
