PRAYER Reverend Erin M. Keys, Capitol Hill Presbyterian Church, Washington, D.C., offered the following prayer: God of love, God of mercy, God of jus-tice, we pray Your blessing upon the work of the representatives of our country. May they govern with wisdom and insight. May they lead with truth and courage. May they listen as much as they speak, both to one another and to You. For Your voice is rarely in thunder and mighty proclamations but in the stillness, in the quiet, in the mo-ments when we pause long enough to hear our hearts beating and to listen to where they ask us to go and what they ask us to do. May Your voice speak again this day, God, and as we cele-brate the birth of our Nation tomor-row, may we all remember with grati-tude the blessing of calling this coun-try our home. Amen.

HONORING THE PROUD PATRIOT ON ITS GRAND OPENING 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, July 3, 2018 Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and congratulate the Proud Patriot on its grand opening. Vanessa and Niklas Herring, co-owners of the Proud Patriot, are passionate about hon-oring those who serve their country. The Proud Patriot is an all-American restaurant in Rouses Point, New York, that offers a 10 per-cent discount to veterans, law enforcement and peace officers. Serving up classic Amer-ican food, the restaurant has its slogan, ‘‘Land of the free because of the brave,’’ proudly writ-ten on its ‘‘veterans wall,’’ decorated with photos of local veterans. Vanessa and Niklas both have military lineage in their families, and Niklas is a proud Army veteran himself. Their dedication giving back to those who sacrificed so much for our country is truly admirable. On behalf of New York’s 21st District, I want to thank Vanessa and Niklas Herring for their honorable commitment to our veterans. I wish the Proud Patriot nothing but success as it opens its doors to the community.

RANSPORTATION SECURITY  T
ECHNOLOGY INNOVATION REFORM ACT OF 2018 As reported by the House Committee on Homeland Security on June 22, 2018 H.R. 5730 would require the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to develop programs to test and evaluate advanced screening technologies related to the agen-cy’s mission. Using information from TSA, CBO expects that meeting the bill’s require-ments would not add significantly to the cost of existing and similar activities related to transportation security. CBO estimates that any change in federal spending under the bill—which would be subject to appro-priation—would total less than $500,000 annu-ally. Enacting H.R. 5730 would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you- go procedures do not apply. CBO estimates that H.R. 5730 would not in-crease net direct spending or on-budget defi-cits in any of the four consecutive 10-year periods beginning in 2029. H.R. 5730 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act. The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Megan Carroll. This estimate was reviewed by Theresa Gullo, Assistant Director for Budget Analysis. f A TRIBUTE TO JOHN REYNOLDS 
HON. DAVID YOUNG 
OF IOWA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, July 3, 2018 Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate John Reynolds of Council Bluffs, Iowa who recently retired from the Pottawattamie County Sheriff’s Department with 30 years of service in law en-forcement. John’s tenure was marked by honor and distinction. John served in many capacities at the Pottawattamie County Sheriff’s office. He was a jailer, court security officer, corporal, and Chief Deputy to Sheriff Jeff Danker. Sheriff Danker said, ‘‘John was an essential part of the Sheriff’s Department. His retirement is not only a huge loss to us, and me, but it’s a big hole to fill. John always did a great job, what-ever role he was in.’’ John said, ‘‘I’ve loved working here. Never had a day I hated coming to work.’’ Mr. Speaker, John Reynolds has made a difference by helping and serving others. It is with great honor that I recognize him today. I know that my colleagues in the United States House of Representatives join me in applaud-ing his accomplishments. I thank him for his service to the Pottawattamie County Sheriff’s Department and the citizens of southwest Iowa and I wish him continued success in the future.

IN RECOGNITION OF COMMANDER KEVIN CAREY 
HON. ROBERT J. WITTMAN 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, July 3, 2018 Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Commander Kevin Carey on his re-tirement from the United States Navy. Kevin received his commission through Offi-cer Candidate School in 1995 after graduating from Old Dominion University with a Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering. Kevin was designated a Naval Aviator in 1997 and qualified as an SH–60B Seahawk Pilot. Kevin amassed over 3,100 hours of flight time in six different naval aircraft. Kevin served several operational tours in-cluding with the HSL–46 Grandmasters, De- stroyer Squadron 24, and the HSL–48 Vipers. He deployed aboard the USS Cape St. George (CG 71), USS Arthur W Radford (DDG 968), USS John F Kennedy (CV 67), and USS Underwood (FFG 36). Kevin filled a variety of billets on the tours to include: Land Safety Officer, Air Operations Officer, Detach-ment Officer-in-Charge, and Squadron Oper-ations Officer. Additionally, Kevin served tours ashore with HT–8 Eight Ballers, the Chief of Science, Technology, and Intelligence for Naval Air Systems Command, and the Appropriations Matters Office in the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Navy. Through the Navy, Kevin pursued several academic opportunities. He attained his acqui-sition certification in Systems Planning, Re-search, Development and Engineering; lifetime membership with BETA GAMMA SIGMA—the International Honor Society Recognizing Busi-ness Excellence; and obtained his Certified Defense Financial Manager certification. Kevin graduated with distinction from the Naval War College with a Command and Staff Diploma, Naval Postgraduate School with a Master of Business Administration in Financial Manage-ment, and School of Aviation Safety. The edu-cation prepared Kevin to screen for Financial Management SCP Commanding Officer. I have the pleasure of knowing Kevin since he was a Boy Scout in Montross, Virginia and I am honored to have watched him grow into the humble servant leader he is today. I wish Kevin and his family the best as they take on this next stage in their life. f 
RECOGNIZING THE RECIPIENTS OF THE 2018 FAIRFAX COUNTY STU-DENT PEACE AWARDS 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, July 3, 2018 Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to rec-ognize the recipients of the 2018 Fairfax County Student Peace Awards. This program began in 2006 to encourage high school aged students to think about peace as both a means and an end, and to recognize young people who work as peace-makers.

Awards program in 2014, which is now being offered in every school in the county. Participating high schools choose one Jun-ior or Senior, or one student group active in promoting peace and/or removing the causes of conflict. Examples of outreach include: com-mitting to peace by engaging in activities that strive to end conflict either locally or globally; seeking to discuss or otherwise resolve poten-tially controversial issues within the school or community; promoting the understanding of di-visive issues and situations to bridge lan-guage, ethnic, racial, religious, gender, sexual orientation, or class differences; and working to resolve conflicts among students or mem-bers of the community who feel isolated or alienated.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor Evonne and Ken Jennett of Bedford, Iowa on the very special occasion of their 60th wedding anniversary on June 14, 2018.

HONORING DAVID GOMEZ 
HON. VICENTE GONZALEZ 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, July 3, 2018 Mr. GONZALEZ of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mr. David Gomez, a school bus driver with the McAllen Inde-pendent School District. Every morning, Mr. Gomez starts his day at 4:30 a.m. to pick up his 200 plus students for their daily bus ride to school. Mr. Gomez dedi-cates his time to getting to know the many students that ride his bus, motivating them to do their best work and always maintaining a positive outlook. His words of encouragement and motivation inspire students to strive for excellence in their daily lives. The interest Mr. Gomez takes in the lives of these students has empowered them in an uplifting way. Mr. Gomez’s heartfelt sentiment should not go unrecognized. Re-cently, students who graduated this summer honored him by thanking him for his work and service, and I wish to honor him here as well. Mr. Speaker, today I share my deepest ad-miration for Mr. Gomez. His hard work for the McAllen Independent School District over the past four years has inspired so many in our community. He has made South Texas a bet-ter place, and I am honored to represent indi-viduals like him in the U.S. House of Rep-resentatives.

CONGRATULATING ZACHARY J. COREY AND KAREN MARIE MALLON FOR RECEIVING THE CARNEGIE MEDAL OF HEROISM 
HON. JACK BERGMAN 
OF MICHIGAN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, July 3, 2018 Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, it’s my honor to congratulate Zachary J. Corey and Karen Marie Mallon for receiving the Carnegie Medal in recognition of their act of extraordinary her-oism. Through their actions, Karen and Zachary have shown themselves to be self-less, courageous, and indispensable parts of Michigan’s First District. The Carnegie Medal was established in 1904 by the industrialist and philanthropist An-drew Carnegie. It is given to recognize those who perform extraordinary acts of heroism in civilian life, and to provide financial assistance for those disabled and the dependents of those killed saving or attempting to save oth-ers. Since 1904, more than 10,000 awardees have been honored, with more than $40 mil-lion given in grants, scholarships, death bene-fits, and other assistance. There is no doubt that Karen and Zachary are deserving of this honor. Six-year-old Olivia Thomas and her sister Addalyn, just 13 days old, along with their mother and eight year-old sister were in a ve-hicle that struck a tow truck head on, veered off the road, and into a shallow ditch where it caught fire. Zachary, the driver of the tow truck, ran to the passenger side of the vehicle where he saw Olivia in the front passenger seat. Unable to open the door, Zachary grasped the window frame and pulled on it, forcing the door open slightly. He extended his upper body inside the vehicle, removed Olivia’s seat belt, and pulled her out. When Karen arrived, she entered through the open rear passenger-side door and knelt on the seat while trying to remove Addalyn from her car seat. With difficulty Mallon freed Addalyn from the seat, picked her up, and exited the vehicle, taking her to safety. Soon after, the vehicle was engulfed by flames. While their mother and 8-year-old sister did not survive the crash, the heroic actions of Zachary and Karen ensured that this tragedy did not take the lives of these two young girls. Their cour-age has touched the lives of countless com-munity members, and the impact of their her-oism cannot be overstated. Mr. Speaker, It’s my honor to recognize Zachary and Karen for their exceptional her-oism in saving the lives of Olivia and Addalyn. Michiganders can take great pride in knowing the First District is home to such selfless and courageous individuals. On behalf of my con-stituents, I wish Karen and Zachary all the best in their future endeavors. f

They were married on May 29, 1958 at First Lutheran Church in Avoca, Iowa. Phyllis and Wayne’s lifelong commitment to each other and their family truly embodies Iowa values. As they reflect on their 60th anni-versary, I hope it is filled with happy memo-ries. May their commitment grow even strong-er, as they continue to love, cherish, and honor one another for many years to come. Mr. Speaker, I commend this great couple on their 60th year together and I wish them many more.

HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, July 3, 2018 Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend the 2018 Northern Virginia Dis-trict PTA Annual Award recipients. Parent Teacher Associations (PTAs) and Parent Teacher Student Associations (PTSAs) in Northern Virginia serve a critical role in help-ing to provide the best possible educational environment for our students. The Northern Virginia District PTA rep-resents a region with more than 220 schools. Maintaining a healthy and strong organization is an important part of allowing these groups to have the greatest possible impact on the students they serve. To encourage such strength, it is important to note the individual PTAs that excel in this mission, as well as the individual Volunteers of the Year. I am pleased to congratulate the following PTAs and individuals on being recognized by the Northern Virginia District PTA for their im-measurable contributions to the education of our children: NOVA District PTA Elementary School Vol-unteer of Year Finalists: Kate Brown, Buzz Aldrin ES PTA; Chad Artz, Hollin Meadows ES PTA; Maria Nguyen, North Springfield ES PTA.

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join with me in recognizing the outstanding achievements of the individuals, PTAs and PTSAs that are being honored tonight. Dedi-cated involvement from so many parents re-flects a strong commitment to public education and community service that students in our schools are fortunate to experience. I offer my strong support for these organizations and their dedicated members and volunteers. f

Both H.R. 5206, and H.R. 5207 would codify programs that currently exist at the Depart-ment of Homeland Security (DHS). CBO esti-mates that enacting the bills would not sig-nificantly affect DHS spending. Because they would not affect direct spending or revenues, pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply. CBO estimates that enacting the bills would not increase net direct spending or on- budget deficits in any of the four consecutive 10–year periods beginning in 2029. Neither of the bills contain intergovern-mental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act.

HONORING GRANT COUNTY COMMISSIONER BOYD BRITTON 
HON. GREG WALDEN 
OF OREGON  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, July 3, 2018 Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my good friend Boyd Britton for his many years of dedicated public service in Grant County. Boyd has executed faithfully his duty as a Grant County Commissioner for 15 years, and I would like to pay tribute to his leadership for the people of Grant County and Eastern Oregon. Boyd was born in Biloxi, Mississippi, but due to his father’s service in the United States Air Force, spent much of his early childhood on the move. His father was a co-pilot of the famed World War II B–17 Bomber known as Old ’666, which was the most decorated B–17 aircraft in the history of the United States Air Force. Eventually, his family settled in Mes-quite, New Mexico. After he started college, he transferred from New Mexico State to Western New Mexico University, which is where he met his soon-to-be wife, Bonnie. Boyd and Bonnie were married in 1974. Boyd worked 17 years for James Hamilton Construction Company, eventually becoming a superintendent of the company. At the time, it was one of the biggest construction compa-nies in New Mexico. Meanwhile, his wife, Bonnie, worked for the United States Forest Service as a Financial Manager. Bonnie’s job with the United States Forest Service moved the family to Susanville, Cali-fornia, where Boyd started his welding busi-ness, and where their daughter, Brandi, grad-uated high school. In 1995, Boyd and Bonnie moved to John Day, Oregon, where Boyd planned to become an artist but quickly real-ized it was a lonely craft. Boyd again opened a welding business, but that trade also lacked the social interaction he craved. In 2002, Boyd won his first Grant County Commissioner race and served for 15 years until June 30, 2018. Commissioner Britton had a unique talent for recognizing potential in people, skillfully bringing them together to ac-complish nearly every challenge the county faced. Boyd’s ability to bridge political divides led him to build the Blue Mountain Forest Partners collaborative group, which has helped improve log supply to the local timber industry. That same skillset helped Boyd ne-gotiate a contract for Community Counseling Solutions to operate Grant County Health De-partment, which brought mental health serv-ices to Grant County for the first time in its history. Boyd had a reputation as the most po-lite commissioner the Association of Oregon Counties had ever known. That said, it was never a mystery where he stood on any issue. Boyd has always taken pride in three nota-ble things: his beautiful marriage to Bonnie, his highly successful daughter Brandi, and having the most famous mustache in Grant County. I know Boyd will take that same pride with him to his new home in Show Low, Ari-zona. Boyd has never stood on the sidelines and watched the world move. Rather, he has always tried to be a driving force behind the motion. I am confident he will continue to be a key player wherever his travels take him. Mr. Speaker and my colleagues, Boyd Britton is a true friend of mine, and I would ask that you please join me in recognizing and thanking him for his many years of leadership in Grant County. I wish Boyd and Bonnie all the best in their new pursuits.

HON. DAVID YOUNG 
OF IOWA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, July 3, 2018 Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Allan P. Duhn for his 50 years of service as a funeral director in Griswold, Iowa. Allan was recently honored at the 138th Annual Iowa Funeral Di-rectors Association Convention. Allan said that he was influenced by his hometown funeral directors and he witnessed the professional services they provided to their communities. He attended the Dallas Institute of Mortuary Science (Gupton Jones College) in Dallas, Texas, and worked for funeral homes in Spirit Lake and Exira, Iowa. In 1970, he purchased the Wagley Funeral Home in Griswold, Iowa. Today, the funeral home is known as the Reiken-Duhn Funeral Home of Griswold. I commend and congratulate Allan P. Duhn for his many years of dedicated and devoted service to Griswold, Iowa and the surrounding area. Allan and his staff have a reputation for making a difference by helping and serving others in time of need. It is with great honor that I recognize him today. I know that my col-leagues in the House of Representatives join me in applauding his service in the funeral in-dustry and I wish him and his family continued success in the future.

CELEBRATING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE TIPPY DAM 
HON. JACK BERGMAN 
OF MICHIGAN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, July 3, 2018 Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, it’s my honor to recognize the Tippy Dam upon the occasion of its 100th Anniversary. Through a century of dedicated service and commitment to its com-munity, the Tippy Dam has become an indis-pensable part of Northern Michigan and the First District. Originally completed in 1918, the dam then- known as Junction Hydro was lauded for its innovative engineering and design. It was later renamed in honor of Charles W. Tippy, a Board of Directors chair for Consumers Power. Spanning the Manistee River 20 miles from its end in Lake Michigan, the Tippy Dam generates 20,000 kilowatts of clean, renew-able electricity for approximately 6,500 resi-dents of Manistee County in Northern Michi-gan. In addition to its critical energy production for the region, the Tippy Dam is beloved for the outdoor recreation it facilitates. Every year, its recreation area hosts over 50,000 visitors— most taking advantage of the world-class fish-ing for salmon, steelhead, and brown trout in its tailwaters. The dam is also home to the largest bat hibernaculum in the Lower Penin-sula of Michigan. Its long stretch of under-ground passages and warm temperature makes the Tippy Dam an ideal location for the more than 20,000 bats that hibernate there over the winter—the dam’s operators have played a critical role in protecting the bats by following strict operation regulations. Tippy Dam is a perfect example of what can happen when business and government work together for the good of the American people. I am pleased to join Consumers Energy employees and retirees to commemorate 100 years of clean, reliable, and renewable energy gen-erated by this facility. Mr. Speaker, it’s my honor to congratulate the fortitude and dedication of the men and women who have kept watch over the Tippy Dam as it has supplied power to generations of Michiganders. On behalf of my constituents, I wish the Tippy Dam and its operators all the best as we look forward to the next 100 years. f

EAR MR. CHAIRMAN : The Congressional Budget Office has reviewed the following pieces of legislation that were passed by the House of Representatives on June 19, 2018: H.R. 4991, the Supporting Research and De-velopment for First Responders Act; H.R. 4627, the Shielding Public Spaces from Vehicular Terrorism Act; and H.R. 5762, the Joint Task Force to Combat Opioid Trafficking Act of 2018. H.R. 4991 would codify programs that cur-rently exist at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). H.R. 4627 would confirm the authority of DHS to establish a task force to disrupt drug trafficking, and H.R. 5762 would clarify the scope of the department’s re-search and development program. CBO estimates that enacting these pieces of legislation would not significantly affect DHS spending. Because the legislation would not affect direct spending or revenues, pay- as-you-go procedures do not apply. CBO estimates that enacting the acts would not increase net direct spending or on- budget deficits in any of the four consecutive 10-year periods beginning in 2029. None of the acts contain intergovern-mental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act. If you wish further details on this esti-mate, we will be pleased to provide

RECOGNIZING THE GRADUATION OF THE FAIRFAX COUNTY FIRE AND RESCUE DEPARTMENT 143RD RECRUIT CLASS 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, July 3, 2018 Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to con-gratulate the Fairfax County Fire and Rescue Department and the graduates of the 143rd Recruit Class. As they prepare to join the ranks of the Fairfax County Fire and Rescue Department, I encourage the thirty-two grad-uates to reflect on the history of the depart-ment, and the contributions and dedication of the brave men and women who have served before them to protect our community. The Fairfax County Fire and Rescue De-partment’s Recruit School consists of an ex-tensive and demanding twenty-four-week pro-gram. In addition to two weeks of orientation, recruits complete seven weeks of EMT train-ing and fifteen weeks of fire suppression train-ing. Upon graduation, these recruits will be certified at the level of Firefighter I/II by the Virginia Department of Fire Programs. These recruits have the distinct honor of joining one of the best Fire and Rescue De-partments in the United States. The efforts of the Fairfax County Fire and Rescue Depart-ment have been recognized across this coun-try. Members from the Department serve on the elite VA Task Force l, which is among the first units called to disaster zones to provide search and rescue support. Members of that Task Force were recognized by the Inter-national Association of Fire Chiefs with the Benjamin Franklin Award for Valor, as a result of their efforts in the aftermath of the dev-astating earthquakes that struck Nepal in 2015. Recently, they have seen extensive work in Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands as part of disaster relief and rescue efforts in the aftermaths of Hurri-canes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. Fairfax County is fortunate to have such ex-cellent ambassadors for our community, and I commend them for all they have done to pro-tect lives and property not only here in Fairfax County, but around the world. As the newest members of the Fire and Rescue Department, the 143rd Recruit Class graduates join the de-partment as integral parts of our community’s emergency response and public safety team. I am confident this graduating class will serve the residents of Fairfax County with honor and distinction. It is my great honor to include in the R
ECORD the names of the 143rd Recruit Class: Melissa A. Berkowitz, Richard N. Burton, Jasper R. Cooper, Megan E. Field, Heather A. Funkhouser, Danny E. Gallardo, Graham K. Gilbert, Matthew C. Harris, Shawn M. Jaret, Jacob W. Johnson, Aria Khodabakhchian, Juan D. Lopez, Daniel J. Mechling, Andrew L. Mullinax, Sarah M. Murphy, Luke F. Nuar, Christian S. Perdue, Natalie J. Potell, Jose L.

Wagner, Jonathan L. Wallace, Stephen M. Williams, Andrew T. Wycheck. Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in congratulating the newest members of the Fairfax County Fire and Rescue Depart-ment. I thank them for their service to their community, and to all members of the Fire and Rescue Department, past and present, I say, ‘‘Stay safe.’’ f 
RECOGNIZING THE 150TH BIRTH-DAY OF BISMARCK, MISSOURI 
HON. JASON SMITH 
OF MISSOURI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, July 3, 2018 Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the sesquicentennial birthday of Bismarck, Missouri, which was founded in 1868. City fathers named the town for Prince Otto Von Bismarck, the ‘Iron Chancellor’ of Germany, in hopes they’d lure German immi-grants to live there. Bismarck became a ship-ping center for the St. Louis Iron Mountain and Southern Railway. Today, the 100-year-old train depot is a treasured landmark. Bismarck is proud of its community spirit. The desire to serve prompted dozens of resi-dents to join the military in wartime. The drive to succeed helped the town recover from a fire that destroyed its business district in 1901. And the determination to overcome challenges has kept the city working to meet the ever- changing needs of its citizens. Today, Bismarck’s leaders are working to in-crease services and add businesses. Mayor Seth Radford describes Bismarck as a place that ‘‘looks out for its neighbors,’’ offering a family-friendly community that brings people together. They look to the future with opti-mism, but maintain a strong connection to their past. It is my great privilege to recognize Bis-marck, Missouri before the United States House of Representatives to mark the town’s 150th birthday. I celebrate the community spir-it, sense of duty and pride that thrives in this St. Francois County town located in the heart of America.

HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, July 3, 2018 Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an outstanding group of men and women in Northern Virginia. These individuals have demonstrated superior dedication to pub-lic safety and have been awarded the pres-tigious Valor Award by the Northern Virginia Chamber of Commerce. This is the 40th Annual Valor Awards spon-sored by the Northern Virginia Chamber of Commerce. This event honors the remarkable heroism and bravery in the line of duty exem-plified by our public safety officers. Our public safety and law enforcement personnel put their lives on the line every day to keep our families and neighborhoods safe. This year’s ceremony will present ninety-one awards to recognize extraordinary actions above and be-yond the call of duty in a variety of categories including the Lifesaving Certificate, the Certifi-cate of Valor, and the Bronze, Silver, and Gold Medal of Valor. Sergeant Mark Asmussen of the U.S. Park Police is being honored this year for his ex-ceptional service with the Certificate of Valor, and it is with great pride that I include his name in the R

Their efforts, made on be-half of the citizens of our community, are self-less acts of heroism and truly merit our high-est praise. I ask my colleagues to join me in applauding this group of remarkable citizens.

its founding, the group has been under contin-uous Dowd family ownership for four genera-tions, providing counsel and insurance protec-tion for a diverse range of clients. In 1865, James J. Dowd, an immigrant from County Kerry, Ireland, arrived in Holyoke, Massachusetts with his wife and fourteen chil-dren. He began working in a textile mill in hopes of building a better life for himself and his family. A few decades later, one of his sons, who bore his name, went on to found Dowd Insurance—laying the foundation for a family legacy that has spanned multiple gen-erations and continues to flourish today. James J. Dowd, II gave up his career as a professional baseball player and joined the firm in 1916 after his father passed away, and James J. Dowd, Jr. and John E. Dowd en-tered the family business in 1947 and 1951 re-spectively after each serving in World War II. The fourth generation of the Dowd family was ushered into the business in 1974 when James J. Dowd, III became a member of the agency. He was then joined by John E. Dowd, Jr., Dowd Insurance’s current President and CEO, in 1982. After more than a century of operation marked by profound growth and success, including having joined the Inter-national Network of Insurance and opening multiple new branch offices, it is evident that Dowd Insurance has made numerous positive contributions to the community of which it takes pride in being an integral part. Mr. Speaker, over the course of its history Dowd Insurance has demonstrated exemplary service, leadership, and dedication. Those traits are hallmarks of the agency’s long and admirable tradition of service in western Mas-sachusetts, and are certainly worthy of rec-ognition. On the occasion of Dowd Insurance’s 120th anniversary, I wish the Dowd family, the agency’s partners, and the dedicated men and women who work with them all the best and much continued prosperity.

ECURING PUBLIC AREAS OF  T
RANSPORTATION FACILITIES ACT OF 2018 As reported by the House Committee on Homeland Security on June 22, 2018 
SUMMARY  H.R. 5766 would direct the Secretary of Homeland Security to establish a working group to develop, in collaboration with pub-lic and private stakeholders, recommenda-tions for enhancing the security of public areas of transportation facilities. The bill also would authorize the secretary to provide technical assistance to owners and operators of surface transportation systems and facili-ties and specify a variety of administrative and reporting requirements. Assuming appropriation of the necessary amounts, CBO estimates that implementing H.R. 5766 would cost $23 million over the 2019–2022 period. Enacting the bill would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply. CBO estimates that enacting H.R. 5766 would not increase net direct spending or on- budget deficits in any of the four consecutive 10-year periods beginning in 2029. H.R. 5766 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA). 
ESTIMATED COST TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT  The estimated budgetary effect of H.R. 5766 is shown in the following table. The costs of the legislation fall within budget function 400 (transportation). 
By fiscal year, in millions of dollars— 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2019– 2023

BASIS OF ESTIMATE  For this estimate, CBO assumes that H.R. 5766 will be enacted near the start of fiscal year 2019 and that necessary funds will be ap-propriated each year. Using information from the Transpor-tation Security Administration (TSA), CBO estimates that ongoing costs to meet new and expanded duties under H.R. 5766 would require appropriations totaling about $5 mil-lion annually. That amount includes:

$2 million to establish and operate an engi-neering laboratory to assess and validate the performance of security-related products; $1.5 million to develop systems necessary to provide technical assistance related to the feasibility of installing and maintaining se-curity technologies; and $1.5 million to expand TSA’s capacity to advise owners and operators of surface trans-portation facilities with large and open areas (such as rail yards, bus yards, and terminals) on how to safeguard those areas. Assuming appropriation of the necessary amounts, CBO estimates that resulting out-lays would total $23 million over the 2019– 2023 period. That estimate is based on histor-ical spending patterns for TSA’s security-re-lated activities. 
PAY-AS-YOU-GO CONSIDERATIONS  None. 
INCREASE IN LONG -TERM DIRECT SPENDING AND  
DEFICITS  CBO estimates that enacting H.R. 5766 would not increase net direct spending or on- budget deficits in any of the four consecutive 10-year periods beginning in 2029.

RECOGNIZING THE 2018 TYSONS REGIONAL CHAMBER OF COM-MERCE BOARD OF DIRECTORS 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, July 3, 2018 Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to rec-ognize the Tysons Regional Chamber of Com-merce and to congratulate the incoming 2018 board members. Tysons has drastically trans-formed during the past 55 years from a sleepy, rural area to one of the most vibrant regions in the country. This change began when the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors approved plans for the Tysons Corner Shop-ping Center in 1962. When the mall opened in 1968, it was hailed as the largest enclosed mall in the world. Since then, there has been a dramatic influx of technology companies, government con-tracting firms, and other corporations. Tysons has become the premier business district of the Washington Metropolitan Area, and is one of the largest employment centers in the United States. With the opening of Metro’s Sil-ver Line, as well as ongoing redevelopment, the region is expected to continue adding not only businesses, but also high-density residen-tial housing. The mission of the Tysons Regional Cham-ber of Commerce is to be the unified voice of the business community, while ensuring its ties and commitment to the community are strengthened. The Chamber actively promotes local non-profits and community organizations, as well as youth educational programs, and it sponsors multiple events each year in support of these activities. The growth of the Chamber has been the result of the diversity of its members and the leadership of its Board. I am pleased to in-clude in the RECORD the names of the incom-ing 2018 board members. Chairman of the Board: Virginia Case General Counsel: William Daly VP of Membership: Joshua Brady VP of Marketing: Chris Tomseth Treasurer: David MacGillivray Secretary: Maureen Loftus At-Large Members: Samim Ardeishar, Susan Baker, Joseph Cathey, Andrew Clark, Kevin Corey, Joe Falit, Jerry Ferguson, Jen-nifer Garry, Tucker Gladhill, Laura Granato, Reza Hassan, Kathy Jensen, Kathleen Kelly, Walter Kim, Jeffrey Krashin, Kathy McNeill, Marge Niedwicz, Shawn Pastor, Vick Rai, Mark Rogoff, Nema Semnani, Trevor Taylor, James Ursini, Diana Villarreal, Patrick Whalen, Peter Wynne Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in congratulating the incoming board mem-bers and in commending the Tysons Regional Chamber of Commerce for its commitment to promoting the business community, while en-couraging social responsibility and civic en-gagement. I wish the Chamber the very best for its continued growth and success.

RANSPORTATION WORKER IDENTI -
FICATION CREDENTIAL ACCOUNTABILITY ACT 
OF2018 As ordered reported by the House Committee on Homeland Security on June 6, 2018 H.R. 5729 would prohibit the U.S. Coast Guard from implementing a rule that, under current law, will take effect on August 23, 2018. The rule requires owners and operators of certain vessels and facilities regulated by the Coast Guard to check biometric security credentials allowing access to certain secure areas. H.R. 5729 would suspend implementa-tion of the rule until 60 days after the Sec-retary of Homeland Security has reported to the Congress on the efficacy of such creden-tials for enhancing security. The bill also would require the Secretary to periodically update the Congress on the status of that as-sessment. CBO estimates that enacting H.R. 5729 would not significantly affect the federal budget. Delaying implementation of the af-fected rule would not alter the timing or magnitude of cash flows related to federally issued credentials nor would it significantly affect the Coast Guard’s administrative costs, which are subject to appropriation. The Department of Homeland Security is al-ready required to complete an assessment re-lated to the effectiveness of credentials issued to transportation workers. Enacting H.R. 5729 would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you- go procedures do not apply. CBO estimates that enacting H.R. 5729 would not increase net direct spending or on- budget deficits in any of the four consecutive 10–year periods beginning in 2029. H.R. 5729 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act. The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Megan Carroll.

HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, July 3, 2018 Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to com-mend the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) and the Criminal Investigation Division of the Marine Corps Installations National Capital Region located at Marine Corps Base Quantico (MCINCR/MCBQ), and congratulate the 2018 Prince William Chamber of Com-merce Investigative Merit Award recipients. The mission of the MCINCR/MCBQ Com-mand Inspector General is to promote combat support readiness and program efficiency of subordinate commands and tenant activities, as required, in accordance with the Marine Corps Inspector General Program. This in-cludes, but is not limited to, effectiveness, effi-ciency, discipline, morale, economy, ethics, and integrity. On February 22, 2017, the U.S. Marine Corps was notified of gender discrimination and harassment occurring on social media sites, as illustrated by Marines United, a pri-vate Facebook group. Within days of notifica-tion, the Marine Corps and NCIS took action to investigate the defamatory matter and pro-vide support services for all impacted by the online misconduct. The subsequent investiga-tion, entitled ‘‘Operations Purple Harbor,’’ ana-lyzed the countless degrading images, com-ments, and videos to identify more than 100 victims and locate those responsible for post-ing the explicit material online. Through the collection of evidence, inter-views of witnesses, interrogations of subjects, and coordination with various law enforcement agencies (both federal and civilian), the Ma-rines and civilians were able to assist victims in obtaining justice for their images being cir-culated without their knowledge or consent, and subsequently change the way the Marine Corps views social media misconduct. It is my honor to include in the Record the following names as the 2018 Prince William Chamber of Commerce-Investigative Merit Award recipients for their extraordinary dedica-tion and outstanding performance in initiating, investigating, and consequently resolving ‘‘Op-eration Purple Harbor’’: Warrant Officer Nicholas Van Effen. Master Gunnery Sergeant Christopher Bates. Gunnery Sergeant Paul Lawless. Staff Sergeant Ryan Martin. Staff Sergeant Daniel Walker. Sergeant Shawn Foley. Sergeant Cody Smith. Sergeant Andrew Timms. Sergeant Mica Hamons. Sergeant Sean Lyon. Mrs. Estrella Carpenter. Ms. Liane Best. Sergeant Logan McEachern. Mr. Speaker, sexual harassment and gender discrimination must never be tolerated in any arena. We have all seen the courage of those who have dared to speak out against these wrongs despite negative public scrutiny or damage to their reputations or even their liveli-hoods. I stand with all who promote safe envi-ronments free of discrimination, harassment, or fear. I ask my colleagues to join me in rec-ognizing the 2018 Prince William Chamber of Commerce Investigative Merit Award recipi-ents of the Criminal Investigative Division of the Marine Corps Installations National Capital Region located at Marine Corps Base Quantico.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Bernadine and Joe Sobotka of Diagonal, Iowa, on the very special occasion of their 65th wedding anniversary on June 27, 2018. Bernadine and Joe’s lifelong commitment to each other and their family truly embodies our Iowa values. As they reflect on their 65th anni-versary, may their commitment grow even stronger, as they continue to love, cherish, and honor one another for many years to come. Mr. Speaker, I commend this great couple on their many years together. I ask that my colleagues in the United States House of Rep-resentatives join me in congratulating them on this momentous occasion and in wishing them both nothing but continued happiness.

RECOGNIZING THE 2018 NORTHERN VIRGINIA FAMILY SERVICE TRAINING FUTURES GRADUATES 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, July 3, 2018 Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to rec-ognize a remarkable group of individuals who are making invaluable contributions to our Northern Virginia community. Founded in 1927, Northern Virginia Family Service (NVFS) has provided assistance to tens of thousands of individuals who otherwise might have gone without the most basic of needs. NVFS does this through a variety of services, including homelessness prevention & housing, early childhood development, health & nutrition, mental health, foster care, and youth initiatives services. One program that deserves special recogni-tion is the Training Futures program. Training Futures works with motivated, talented unem-ployed or under-employed individuals who have been largely overlooked in our commu-nities, and who lack the skills needed to obtain better paying jobs offering real futures. Over the course of the six-month program, clients attend classes and programs designed to de-velop tactical office skills, including a Microsoft Office certificate that will better prepare them for a full-time, office-support position. Through this training, graduates gain the skills, confidence, and cultural know-how to excel in professional, office support positions across industries. This creates a powerful and diverse talent pipeline for local businesses. Over the last twenty years, Training Futures has graduated over 2,200 individuals, with 75 percent of those individuals obtaining employ-ment in office careers within six months of graduation. These jobs not only pay 60–65 percent more on average than what these graduates previously earned, but they also provide regular schedules and real opportuni-ties for professional growth and promotion. I meet often with Fortune 500 companies in my district, and a constant refrain among lead-ership is the difficulty in finding qualified appli-cants to fill their vacancies. This program and others like it help fill that gap, and put skilled professionals in positions throughout Northern Virginia. This provides economic benefits not only to our community, but to the Common-wealth of Virginia as a whole. It is my honor to include in the RECORD the names of the 2018 Training Futures grad-uates: Bahtiye Top, Beatriz Silva Aldana, Caroline Thai, Catalin Enamorado, Chiharu Adams, Edith Chistelle Toukam, Elias Abebe, Eliza-beth Degeffa, Ester Lopez, Eyob Gebremariam, Fannie Ndemou, Fatima Khachab, Fatma Saeed, Feyzan Hajiesmailoo, Geraldine Sierra Parrado, Jonathan Angles, Koshan Jelani, Kyung Wha Hong, Manal Abdelmalak, Mieraf Demissie, Muna Addus, Nasser El Kekli, Neelad Haidari, Nibret Kebede, Roxana Saravia Ortiz, Salome Messa, Seung Hee Lee, Sophia Hassen, Ste-ven Smaw, Tariq Habib, Tsering Choedon, Victoria Slaughter, Wendy Medrano, Zabiullah Nekzad, Zarema Dugrichilova. Mr. Speaker, programs like Training Futures provide invaluable experiences for their grad-uates, while also helping them to create a bet-ter life for themselves and their families. I con-gratulate all of the graduates of this year’s Training Futures program, as well as the Board of Directors and staff of Northern Vir-ginia Family Service for all they do to make our community a better place. I ask my col-leagues to please join me in wishing them great success in all their future endeavors.

RECOGNIZING THE 150TH ANNIVER-SARY OF THE CITY OF CONCORD 
HON. MARK DeSAULNIER 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, July 3, 2018 Mr. D
ESAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the 150th anniversary of the found-ing of the City of Concord, California. The history of Concord begins with the Miwok people, Californian Native Americans who inhabited areas of North-Central Cali-fornia. Originally founded as the community of Todos Santos by Salvio Pacheco, the name was soon changed to Concord by the city’s residents. During its early years, Concord thrived as an agricultural community, first hav-ing many vineyards which gave way to walnut orchards as a result of prohibition. One of Concord’s most significant drivers has been the Concord Naval Weapons Station (CNWS), a military base established in 1942. The station functioned as a World War II ar-mament storage depot, supplying ships at Port Chicago. CNWS continued to support war ef-forts during the Korean War, the Vietnam War and the Gulf War, processing and shipping thousands of tons of materiel out across the Pacific Ocean. A portion of CNWS has since been closed and is scheduled to be transferred to the City for a residential and commercial development while reserving approximately two-thirds for open-space and parks projects. The site is also home to the GoMentum Station proving groups, which is used to test self-driving cars. CNWS is helping to keep Concord evolving and an attractive location for Bay Area resi-dents. Today, Concord’s classic old downtown has a multi-story skyline and it is now the largest city in Contra Costa County. As a longtime resident of Concord and someone who has represented it in the city, county, state, and federal government, I am grateful to represent such a diverse city and extend my congratulations on its 150th anni-versary.

TRIBUTE TO MR. JOHN FOREMAN 
HON. RODNEY DAVIS 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, July 3, 2018 Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speak-er, I rise along with my colleague Rep. S
HIM-
KUS, to honor John Foreman, longtime editor of the News-Gazette who tragically passed away over the weekend. John graduated from Atwood-Hammond High School in 1970 and first joined the news-paper after graduating from the University of Illinois in 1977. He was a part-time weekend reporter, and eventually made his way to edi-tor-in-chief by 1986. In 2003, John was made publisher of his hometown newspaper. John loved everything about working at the News-Gazette. He loved local journalism and knew better than anyone the importance of the relationship between a community and its newspaper. To many, he embodied the spirit of everything the News-Gazette stands for. John was widely-respected in his career as an established journalist and a fierce advocate for the freedom of the press. He dedicated his professional life to protecting this First Amend-ment right and held several leadership roles in organizations like the Illinois Press Associa-tion, the Illinois Associated Press Editors, Mid- America Press Institute and many more. He was the first recipient of the James C. Craven Award for Freedom of the Press from the Illi-nois Press Association and he was also named Illinois Journalist of the Year in 2006. He was both a mentor and friend to us, and many at the News-Gazette, and his absence will not go unnoticed. We extend our deepest condolences to his wife Sharon, his News-Gazette family and all those who knew John. He was a valued mem-ber of the Champaign-Urbana community and will be truly missed. f 
A TRIBUTE TO LOIS FIGGINS 
HON. DAVID YOUNG 
OF IOWA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, July 3, 2018 Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Lois Figgins of Atlantic, Iowa who recently retired after 50 years of service within the banking in-dustry. Lois began her banking career in 1964. She started working at First Whitney Bank and completed her career at TS Bank in Atlantic. She had a hiatus from work at the bank when she lived overseas when her husband was serving in the military. Lois said she has seen many changes at the bank over the years. When she started working, everything was done on paper; there were no computers. Lois has worked in many different aspects of the banking industry, in-cluding bookkeeper, teller, assistant cashier, secretary of the installment loan department and most recently as the Credit Administrative Assistant for TS Bank in Atlantic. Lois said her favorite part of her job was waiting on the cus-tomers and greeting them as they came in the door. She said she is, ‘‘grateful for the time she has spent in the banking industry, espe-cially the last few years at TS Bank.’’ Lois is active at Zion Lutheran Church, Relay for Life and a sewing group called, ‘‘The Knotty La-dies.’’ Mr. Speaker, Lois Figgins has made a dif-ference by helping and serving others. It is with great honor that I recognize her today. I know that my colleagues in the House of Rep-resentatives join me in applauding her accom-plishments. I thank her for her service to TS Bank and Southwest Iowa, and wish her con-tinued success in the future. RECOGNIZING THE 2018 LORDS AND LADIES FAIRFAX HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, July 3, 2018 Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to rec-ognize a dedicated group of men and women in Northern Virginia. Every year, each member of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors se-lects two people from his or her district who have demonstrated outstanding volunteer service, heroism, or other exceptional commit-ments and contributions to our community.

This year, the Fairfax County Board of Su-pervisors will recognize those individuals who have made tremendous impacts through their support of our public schools, parks, youth sports leagues, arts community, public safety, and human service programs. It is nearly im-possible to fully describe the diversity of ac-complishments of the honorees. Their efforts contribute greatly to the quality of life for the residents of Fairfax County, and are worthy of our praise and sincere appreciation. It is my honor to include in the R
