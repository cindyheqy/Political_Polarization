TRIBUTE IN HONOR OF DAVE HOPKINS 
HON. HAROLD ROGERS 
OF KENTUCKY  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, August 31, 2018 Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Dave Hopkins, for his years of invaluable service in fighting the opioid epidemic with the Kentucky All-Sched-ule Prescription Electronic Reporting System (KASPER). A true icon and pioneer in the world of prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMP), Dave has left an indelible mark on our Commonwealth—and indeed, the entire nation—for his leadership in fighting the scourge of drug abuse that has plagued far too many communities. His retirement on Au-gust 31, 2018 marks the end of a storied 13- year career with the Drug Enforcement & Pro-fessional Practices Branch in the Office of In-spector General; however, Dave will forever remain a part of the KASPER family. Dave joined the KASPER team as Grant Manager in 2005, and has since secured over $4.5 million in federal funding for this groundbreaking program. Indeed, in many re-spects, due to Dave’s vision, KASPER has paved the way for successful implementation and integration of PDMPs in every state across our country. In particular, he was an in-tegral part of the team that transitioned KASPER from a voluntary prescription drug monitoring system to a mandatory use system through the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services; this modification has proved invaluable in engaging the medical community in our shared fight against the abuse of pre-scription medications. In his role, Dave has worked tirelessly to educate prescribers, dis-pensers, and law enforcement to use this sys-tem and to help fight the spread of opioid abuse in the Fifth District and across Ken-tucky. Since KASPER became one of the first mandatory programs in the country, the Com-monwealth has seen a reduction of nearly 90 million dosage units of opioid painkillers— which is a tremendous achievement. Furthermore, Dave has worked on legisla-tion and policy solutions, spoken at con-ferences across the country, and worked with state and international leaders to develop their own prescription drug monitoring programs. When I have had the honor of sharing the stage with Dave, he has been introduced by his colleagues and peers as ‘‘Dave Kasper,’’ a true testament to how he’s become synony-mous with Kentucky’s premiere PDMP. Dave’s commitment to fighting prescription drug abuse extends even beyond his career with KASPER. He is a member of the Ken-tucky Narcotics Officers Association and the National Association of Drug Diversion Inves-tigators, and has held positions in many orga-nizations, including the Alliance of States with Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs, RxCheck Governance Committee, Regional Judicial Opioid Initiative, and Operation UNITE—which is near and dear to my heart. It is dedicated people like Dave Hopkins who will help us overcome the opioid epidemic facing our nation, and my wife, Cynthia, and I wish him all the best as he enters into retire-ment. Congratulations, Dave, and Godspeed. f 
HONORING THOMAS STUMP 
HON. SAM GRAVES 
OF MISSOURI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, August 31, 2018 Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I proudly pause to recognize Thomas Stump. Thomas is a very special young man who has exemplified the finest qualities of citizenship and leadership by taking an active part in the Boy Scouts of America, Troop 247, and earn-ing the most prestigious award of Eagle Scout. Thomas has been very active with his troop, participating in many scout activities. Over the many years Thomas has been involved with scouting, he has not only earned numerous merit badges, but also the respect of his fam-ily, peers, and community. Most notably, Thomas has contributed to his community through his Eagle Scout project. Mr. Speaker, I proudly ask you to join me in commending Thomas Stump for his accom-plishments with the Boy Scouts of America and for his efforts put forth in achieving the highest distinction of Eagle Scout.

IN MEMORIAM TOBY ROBERTA STAHL 
HON. KYRSTEN SINEMA 
OF ARIZONA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, August 31, 2018 Ms. SINEMA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of Toby Roberta Stahl who passed away on August 19, 2018 at the age of 80. Mrs. Stahl was an activist who fought for human rights and worked toward equality and justice for all in Arizona. Our state will miss her dearly. When Mrs. Stahl retired from her career as a computer programmer in 2000, she dedi-cated her time and efforts to fighting for edu-cation, healthcare, protecting families and human rights. She worked tirelessly for the Democratic party as a volunteer, serving as Precinct Committeeman and member of the Arizona State Democratic Committee. Mrs. Stahl also served as the president of Democ-racy for America-Maricopa County for many years. Outside of politics, Mrs. Stahl worked to pre-serve Arizona’s natural history, was a devout Diamondbacks fan, and spent time with her four grandsons. She also served as the auxil-iary president of Pueblo Grande Museum in Phoenix for three years. Mrs. Stahl is survived by her three children, Barry, Fran, and Carrie, her son-in-law, Lewis Dickson, daughter-in-law, Patricia Angelucci, and her four grandsons, Jonas, Kai, Rei and Ari. Please join me in honoring her memory. f 
CONGRATULATING MR. CLEMENTE OTERO 
HON. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM 
OF NEW MEXICO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, August 31, 2018 Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratu-late Mr. Clemente Otero of Santa Ana Pueblo, New Mexico, on his graduation from Santa Fe Indian School. Mr. Otero is 92 years old and was originally unable to receive his high school diploma because he was bravely serv-ing our country in World War II. Mr. Otero was one of over 100 students at Santa Fe Indian School drafted into the United States Army during World War II. Beginning in 1944, he served as a Private in a field artillery battalion in both the European and Pacific the-aters. He initially served in Central Europe ahead of the liberation of Germany, and was then stationed in the Philippines until the sur-render of the Japanese. After returning home from the war, Mr. Otero worked in a variety of fields including masonry, automotive repair, and house paint-ing. He also worked for the University of New Mexico’s facilities department until his retire-ment in 1998. Mr. Otero has five children, seven grand-children, ten great-grandchildren, and two great-great-grandchildren. It was one of Mr. Otero’s children, Grace Baca, who initially ap-plied for her father’s high school diploma through the Department of Veterans Affairs’ Operation Recognition. This wonderful pro-gram recognizes the service and sacrifice of those who served in World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War and were therefore unable to receive their high school diplomas when they were younger. Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate Mr. Clemente Otero on receiving his high school diploma. Mr. Clemente represents what makes our state and our nation so exceptional, and his brave service and sacrifice will not be for-gotten.

CELEBRATING MR. NELSON LEE TRIMMER 
HON. STEVE STIVERS 
OF OHIO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, August 31, 2018 Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the people of Ohio’s 15th Congres-sional District to celebrate the birthday of one of Fairfield County, Ohio’s most distinguished citizens, a man who continues to devote his life to bringing smiles to others, Mr. Nelson Lee Trimmer.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD —Extensions of RemarksE1186 August 31, 2018 
Mr. Trimmer has been a fixture of our com-munity for a century. From his lifelong mem-bership with the Trinity Evangelical United Brethren Church and his established career as a mechanist and small business owner of Millersport Garage, he has built a wonderful and fulfilling life in Millersport surrounded by his wife, Pauline, two children, Nelson and Pamela, their ten grandchildren, seventeen great-grandchildren and five great-great-grand-children. Beyond his career as a machinist, Mr. Trim-mer holds a deep appreciation for antique cars, which he is always willing to share with others, as evidenced by his founding of a Hot Rod Club for local youth and his continued in-volvement with the Lancaster Old Car Club. Perhaps what is most remarkable about Mr. Trimmer is his commitment to serving all those around him. As a member of the Army Air Corp, he served our nation in the Second World War, and as Mayor of Millersport, he spent his days diligently working to improve the lives of his neighbors. Moreover, there was never a need that went unnoticed by Mr. Trimmer. He dedicated his free time for over three decades as a volunteer member of the Millersport Fire Department and delighted local children as he and his beloved dog, Bootsy, drove the school bus. Mr. Trimmer is a ray of sunshine who brings smiles to everyone he meets. Millersport is un-deniably a better place because of Mr. Nelson Lee Trimmer, and I encourage my colleagues to join me in wishing him a very happy 100th birthday as he celebrates on September 1, 2018.

RECOGNIZING THE ZIONIST ORGA-NIZATION OF AMERICA GREATER PHILADELPHIA CHAPTER’S 2018 GALA 
HON. LOU BARLETTA 
OF PENNSYLVANIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, August 31, 2018 Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, it is a great honor to recognize the Zionist Organization of America’s Greater Philadelphia Chapter as they celebrate their 2018 Gala. This event highlights America and Israel’s important rela-tionship, as well as provides an opportunity to honor individuals who have been especially active in their communities. Since its founding in 1897, the Zionist Orga-nization of America has sought to raise aware-ness of the American-Israeli relationship and to educate the American public on the realities of the Israeli experience. The Greater Phila-delphia Chapter has remained a strong source of Israeli activism, as it provides educational opportunities and resources to the citizens of my home state of Pennsylvania. I want to extend a special congratulations to this year’s honorees at the 2018 Gala: Sam Rohrer, Sharon Meller, Menachem Meller, Wil-liam Wanger, Cynthia Wanger, Sharon Resnick, and Jeff Resnick. These dedicated individuals are important advocates for one of the United States’ most trusted allies, and their work remains vital to our nation’s inter-national strategy. Throughout their impressive careers, they have advanced and uplifted their communities, fostered the growth of young professionals, and empowered American and Israeli families. Such dedication to local and international service is certainly deserving of widespread recognition. Mr. Speaker, please join me in recognizing the Zionist Organization of America’s Greater Philadelphia Chapter as they celebrate their 2018 Gala and honor these seven outstanding men and women. f 
TRIBUTE IN HONOR OF SANDY RUNYON 
HON. HAROLD ROGERS 
OF KENTUCKY  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, August 31, 2018 Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to one of Eastern Kentucky’s greatest champions, my friend Sandy Runyon, who is retiring after 18 years of dedication as Executive Director of the Big Sandy Area Development District (ADD). She has been a staunch advocate for economic development and infrastructure enhancement in Kentucky’s Appalachian region for many years. Throughout her life, Sandy has always self-lessly served those around her, which has been overwhelmingly visible within the various positions she has held. Before Sandy was ap-pointed as the Executive Director of the Big Sandy ADD, she was my first Field Represent-ative in the Big Sandy area and an ardent campaign advisor. In fact, she helped manage my 1992 campaign in the Big Sandy region when the boundaries of Kentucky’s Fifth Con-gressional District expanded to the state’s West Virginia border. In a region where Re-publicans were few and far between, Sandy put her name on the line and introduced me to everyone she knew, and more. With several new counties joining the district, it proved to be the closest election of my congressional service, but I owe a great debt of gratitude to Sandy Runyon for that victory. After the elec-tion, I hired Sandy to open and run my new Pikeville office. In both the congressional of-fice and the Big Sandy ADD, she has served the great people of Eastern Kentucky with tre-mendous compassion and vigor. She has proven to be a diligent advocate for infrastructure enhancement in our small, rural communities, and a trusted guide for local government leaders. In fact, she personally spent hours with the Bureau of Prisons to make the Big Sandy Penitentiary a reality in a region desperately in need of good paying jobs. Throughout her time as Executive Direc-tor, the Big Sandy region has experienced overwhelming economic progress and growth. She has demonstrated admirable leadership in trailblazing the way for new projects and part-nerships that have tremendously benefitted the Big Sandy area. Sandy’s love for Eastern Kentucky has been evident in her tireless dedication and adamant advocacy. Her service to our region has been nothing short of phenomenal. She is truly one in a million, and it is people like her who make Eastern Kentucky such an incredible place. I deeply appreciate Sandy’s service, her leadership, her advice and most importantly, her loyal friendship. As she enters retirement, my wife, Cynthia, and I wish Sandy and her family tremendous joy and blessings in the years to come. RECOGNIZING DAN OVERBEY’S RE-TIREMENT FROM SOUTHEAST MISSOURI REGIONAL PORT AU-THORITY HON. JASON SMITH 
OF MISSOURI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, August 31, 2018 Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Dan Overbey for 25 years of dedicated service to his community serving as Executive Director of the Southeast Missouri Regional Port Authority. His positive attitude and problem solving mindset has been a great asset to the Port and the Eighth District of Missouri. He has achieved many accomplish-ments during his tenure, such as obtaining 12 miles of railroad track for port use, Port expan-sions, securing businesses and infrastructure. Dan pursued a business degree and grad-uated with honors from Southeast Missouri State University and received his MBA from University of Texas. Mr. Overbey worked at Missouri Pacific Railroad, Frisco Railway and BN Transport. For a short time, he was a mar-keting professor at Southeast Missouri State University. All of these experiences led Mr. Dan Overbey to his role, as Executive Director of Southeast Missouri Regional Port Authority. The Port’s standing has improved significantly since he took over 25 years ago; there are now over $60 million in assets from compa-nies operating at SEMO Port that employ 155 people. The Port itself now has land, harbor, railroad tracks, and utilities that total to $29 million in assets. Mr. Overbey is a dedicated husband to his wife Gail and father of their two sons—Jeffrey and Douglas. He looks forward to traveling during his retirement visiting with family and two grandsons, Mattox and Jaxson. For his many years of dedication and serv-ice to the Southeast Missouri Regional Port Authority and his community, it is my great pleasure to honor Dan Overbey of Cape Girardeau, Missouri today before the United States House of Representatives.
