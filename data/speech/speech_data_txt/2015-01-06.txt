.H1 Vol. 161 WASHINGTON, TUESDAY, JANUARY 6, 2015 No. 1 
House of Representatives 
This being the day fixed by Public 
Law 113–201, pursuant to the 20th amendment to the Constitution of the United States, for the meeting of the 114th Congress of the United States, the Representatives-elect met in their Hall, and at noon were called to order by the Clerk of the House of Represent-atives, Hon. Karen L. Haas. 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick 
J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: 
Loving God, we give You thanks for 
giving us another day. 
We gather on this most significant 
day when, once again, we celebrate the peaceful transition of democratic gov-ernment. Though many return from the 113th Congress, this people’s House is a new legislative assembly. 
May the service of all the Members 
here gathered give You glory and ac-quit well the charge entrusted to them by their fellow citizens. 
Give each Member an abundance of 
wisdom, knowledge, and under-standing, that they might know best how to proceed in the work they have been given to do, as well as the courage to act once they have discerned where Your Spirit might lead them. 
And may all that is done this day and 
all the days of the 114th Congress be for Your greater honor and glory. 
Amen. 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE  
The CLERK. The Representatives- 
elect and their guests will please re-main standing and join in the Pledge of Allegiance. 
The Clerk led the Pledge of Alle-
giance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-lic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The CLERK. As directed by law, the 
Clerk of the House has prepared the of-ficial roll of the Representatives-elect.

seats in the 114th Congress have been received by the Clerk of the House, and the names of those persons whose cre-
dentials show that they were regularly elected as Representatives in accord-ance with the laws of their respective States or of the United States will be called.

their presence by electronic device and their names will be reported in alpha-betical order by State, beginning with the State of Alabama, to determine whether a quorum is present. 
Representatives-elect will have a 
minimum of 15 minutes to record their presence by electronic device. 
Representatives-elect who have not 
obtained their voting ID cards may do so now in the Speaker’s lobby.

Hon. J OHNBOEHNER , 
Speaker, House of Representatives, The Capitol, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR SPEAKER BOEHNER : I am writing to 
inform you that I have notified Cesar Perales, Secretary of State of the State of New York of my resignation from the U.S. House of Representatives effective January 5, 2015. A copy of that letter is attached. 
I do not intend to take the oath of office of 
Representative for the Eleventh District of New York in the 114th Congress. 
It has been a tremendous honor to rep-
resent the Eleventh Congressional District of New York. This decision is made with a heavy heart, as I have enjoyed a very special relationship and closeness with my constitu-ents, whom I care about deeply, it is now time for me to start the next chapter of my life. 
It has been an honor and a privilege to 
serve the hardworking families of Staten Is-land and Brooklyn, and I am sincerely grate-ful for the love and support that I have re-ceived from so many over the past few dif-ficult months. I have seen first-hand how ex-traordinary the people of this District are— their values, their love of community, and their care for each other in the best and worst of times—it is humbling. I am grate-ful, and I will always keep them in my pray-ers. 
Sincerely, 
M
ICHAEL GRIMM , 
Member of Congress , 
Eleventh District of New York.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H3 January 6, 2015 
House of Representatives for the 114th 
Congress. 
Nominations are now in order. The Clerk recognizes the gentle-
woman from Washington (Mrs. M
CMOR-
RISRODGERS ). 
Mrs. M CMORRIS RODGERS. Madam 
Clerk, it is an honor to address the House at the start of the 114th Con-gress. If there is one thing I have learned as a legislator, it is that we cannot achieve great things alone. It takes a willingness to come together, find common ground, and advance solu-tions that make people’s lives better. In that spirit, I welcome America’s new Congress, one that will chart the path towards a government that is more open, transparent, and trustworthy. 
To lead us on this path, the Repub-
lican Conference has nominated a man of great character and conviction. The second oldest of 12 children, he grew up mopping floors and waiting tables at his family’s tavern. He ran a successful small business. He was elected to the Ohio State House and then this House, where he served as committee chair-man, Republican Conference chairman, minority leader, majority leader, and Speaker. He is a reformer who works every day to make government more accountable to the people. For all of this, he calls himself a regular guy with a big job; and that job, he says, is to listen, because if we listen to the people, listen to one another, there is no telling what we can accomplish to-gether for the future of this great country. 
Madam Clerk, as chair of the Repub-
lican Conference and by unanimous vote of that conference, I present for election to the office of Speaker of the House of Representatives for the 114th Congress the name of the Honorable J
OHNA. B OEHNER , our dear friend and 
colleague, a Representative-elect from the State of Ohio. 
The CLERK. The Clerk now recog-
nizes the gentleman from California (Mr. B
ECERRA ). 
Mr. BECERRA. Madam Clerk, first I 
would like to recognize each and every Member who has taken to this floor to represent the people of the United States and say congratulations to them and to all of their loved ones who are here witnessing this solemn event where we will have an opportunity to lead our country. We say congratula-tions to them as well. 
Madam Clerk, I have the distinct 
pleasure of nominating someone who is a proven leader, someone who already will go down in history as one of the most effective Speakers the House of 
Representatives has ever seen, someone who has shown that it doesn’t take a man to get the job done, that it can be done by an American who is devoted to this country, someone who knows her heritage, someone who has worked tirelessly for the American people, but someone who understands first and foremost that the job of this House is to get things done. 
I have been empowered, Madam 
Clerk, to nominate on behalf of all working Americans, those Americans 
who still believe in the American Dream, to put the name of the gentle-woman from San Francisco who will serve again in the House of Representa-tives, put her name forward for the of-fice of the Speaker of the House of Rep-resentatives for the 114th Congress. I, therefore, at this point put before you the name of N
ANCY PELOSI to serve as 
the Speaker of the House of Represent-atives. 
The CLERK. The names of the Hon-
orable J
OHNA. B OEHNER , a Representa-
tive-elect from the State of Ohio, and the Honorable N
ANCY PELOSI , a Rep-
resentative-elect from the State of California, have been placed in nomina-tion. 
Are there further nominations? Mr. MASSIE. Madam Clerk, I present 
for election to the office of Speaker of the House of Representatives for the 114th Congress the name of the Honor-able T
EDYOHO, a great defender of the 
Constitution and Representative-elect from the great State of Florida. 
The CLERK. Are there further nomi-
nations? 
Mr. BRIDENSTINE. Madam Clerk, I 
present for the election of the office of Speaker of the House of Representa-tives for the 114th Congress the name of Judge L
OUIE GOHMERT , a Representa-
tive-elect from the great State of Texas. 
Madam Clerk, Judge G
OHMERT proud-
ly serves the First District of Texas. He is serving his fifth term in the House of Representatives. Prior to being elected to serve in Congress, he was elected to three terms as district judge in Smith County and was ap-pointed by Governor Rick Perry to be the chief justice of the 12th Court of Appeals. 
Madam Clerk, this is not about Judge 
G
OHMERT ; it is about establishing a 
strong check on the executive branch. I think a quote applies to my friend L
OUIE GOHMERT . It is from Mark 
Twain. He said: 
In the beginning of a change, the patriot is 
a scarce man, and he is brave and hated and scorned. When his cause succeeds, the timid join him, for then it costs nothing to be a pa-triot. 
My constituents from the First Dis-
trict of Oklahoma are looking for this kind of patriot. 
The CLERK. Are there further nomi-
nations? 
b1245 
Mr. KING of Iowa. Madam Clerk, I 
rise to place in a nomination for elec-tion to the constitutional office of Speaker of the United States House of Representatives a man who has served as speaker of the statehouse, a man who respects this institution, a man who understands that power and prin-ciple cannot coexist without recog-nizing the sanctity of each Member’s vote in this House of Representatives, a man who will restore this institution of the House of Representatives. I place in nomination the name of D
ANIEL  WEBSTER , a Representative-elect from 
the great State of Florida. 
The CLERK. Are there further nomi-
nations? 
The names of the Honorable J OHNA. 
BOEHNER , a Representative-elect from 
the State of Ohio; the Honorable N ANCY  
PELOSI , a Representative-elect from 
the State of California; the Honorable T
EDYOHO, a Representative-elect from 
the State of Florida; the Honorable L
OUIE GOHMERT , a Representative-elect 
from the State of Texas; and the Hon-orable D
ANIEL WEBSTER , a Representa-
tive-elect from the State of Florida, have been placed in nomination. 
Are there further nominations? There being no further nominations, 
the Clerk appoints the following tell-ers: 
The gentlewoman from Michigan 
(Mrs. M
ILLER ); 
The gentleman from Pennsylvania 
(Mr. B RADY ); 
The gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. 
KAPTUR ); and 
The gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. 
ROS-LEHTINEN ). 
The tellers will come forward and 
take their seats at the desk in front of the Speaker’s rostrum. 
The roll will now be called, and those 
responding to their names will indicate by surname the nominee of their choos-ing. 
The Reading Clerk will now call the 
roll. 
The tellers having taken their places, 
the House proceeded to vote for the Speaker.

Mario Cuomo. I extend condolences to 
our colleagues from the State of New York and have extended the sym-pathies of many in this body to Gov-ernor Cuomo’s widow, Matilda, and to his family. As an Italian American, I am especially proud of his leadership and extend sympathies to his family. Thank you, Cuomo family. Thank you, New York delegation. 
None of us would be standing here 
without the support and the strength of our families. Today, I am going to thank my dear husband of 51 years, Paul Pelosi, and my five children and nine grandchildren, all the Pelosis and D’Alesandros. Let all of us applaud all of our families. 
To my Democratic colleagues and to 
my constituents in San Francisco, I thank you for the privilege of serving in the House, but to my colleagues, I thank you for the honor of serving as leader, but all of us should applaud all of our constituents for sending us here. So let us, again, applaud our constitu-ents. 
Each one of us, Mr. Speaker, as you 
know, represents Republicans, rep-resents Democrats, Independents, and others, and we should always pay trib-ute to the American people. The Amer-ican people have called upon each of us to serve them. They have entrusted us with their hopes, their dreams, and they have asked us to address their challenges. 
The financial stability of a strong 
middle class and those who aspire to it is the bedrock of our economy and the backbone of our American democracy. We have a moral imperative to ensure that working men and women enjoy the bounty of their unprecedented pro-ductivity and to expand the purchasing power of families. 
To that end, today, Democrats will 
put forward a legislative package to put Americans back to work building our roads and bridges and meeting the needs of the American people, paid for by bringing our tax dollars back home and to increase the paycheck of Amer-ica’s working families. 
We invite our Republican colleagues 
to join us in supporting the Stop Cor-porate Expatriation and Invest in America’s Infrastructure Act. It is time to stop rewarding companies to move overseas and instead use those dollars to create good-paying jobs here at home. 
We ask for Republican support and 
action on the CEO-Employee Pay Fair-ness Act, legislation to ensure that workers share in the fruit of their pro-
ductivity, denying CEOs the ability to claim tax deductions on annual income over $1 million unless they give their employees a well-deserved raise. 
We must have an economy that 
works for everyone, not just the privi-leged few, and we hope Republicans will join us to achieve a better infra-structure and bigger paychecks for the working people of our country—better infrastructure, bigger paychecks. 
We open this 114th Congress in the 
year we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act, one of the 
most consequential pieces of legisla-tion in our history. President Lyndon Johnson and Congress passed it. The President signed it. Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., and others, along with our own J
OHNLEWIS, fought for it 
and inspired it. We must continue to inspire the engagement of every Amer-ican. It is the vote that preserves our democracy, ends injustice, advances dreams, and sustains our freedom. 
In terms of protecting our freedom, 
let us recognize, salute, and thank all of those brave Americans who protect our rights—indeed, protect all of our liberty—our men and women in uni-form, our veterans, and our military families. 
Mr. Speaker, today, we are at the 
start of a new year and a new Congress, with fresh opportunity for the Amer-ican people. Today is the Feast of the Epiphany, the visit of the magi; so let us have our own epiphany, for this mo-ment, on this day, we are not just Re-publicans and Democrats, we are Amer-icans not just in name, but in spirit, standing on higher ground than the last election. 
My hope is that in the inevitable ex-
changes and clashes that may happen in the months ahead, we will not lose sight of the truth that is as fresh as this ceremony is today and as historic as our Republic that the ideals that unite us are stronger than the issues that divide us in this House. 
That does not mean that we are dis-
pensing with all disagreements in this debate. Our democracy is robust pre-cisely because we have beliefs and we stand proudly, even persistently, for them; and our democracy endures and prevails because in the end, we are humble enough to find a way forward together. 
My fellow colleagues of the 114th 
Congress, let us uphold our deep and different convictions, but let us honor our common obligation to our country. In this Congress, we will do so under the leadership of Speaker J
OHN BOEH-
NER. 
b1415 
This House will continue to be led by 
a proud son of Ohio and a happy fan of the Ohio State football team. A man of abiding faith, great heart, and deep dedication, J
OHN BOEHNER is truly a 
gentleman from Ohio. 
Congratulations to you, J OHN, to Mr. 
Speaker, to Debbie, to your daughters, Lindsay and Tricia, and the entire Boehner family. Thank you for sharing J
OHNBOEHNER with us. God bless you 
and your family, Mr. Speaker. 
May God continue to bless the Mem-
bers of the House of Representatives. This is the people’s House. This is the people’s gavel. In the people’s name, it is my privilege to hand it to the Speak-er of the House for the 114th Congress, the Honorable J
OHNBOEHNER . 
God bless you, Mr. Speaker, and God 
bless America. 
Mr. BOEHNER. Thank you. Friends, colleagues, countrymen, and 
especially the people of Ohio’s Eighth Congressional District, thank you for sending me here. Let us today welcome all of the new Members and all of their families to what we all know to be a truly historic day. 
As we welcome all of the Members 
back who were reelected, we want to welcome your families as well, and I want to thank my family. I was doing pretty well on the walk over here from 
my ceremonial office until I ran into D
EVIN NUNES ’ three little girls—my 
three biggest fans—and one of them came running over and gave me a kiss, and I was a mess. 
This is the day the Lord has made. 
Let us rejoice and be glad. We rejoice that our new Members and families are here. We welcome them. We are glad and humbled to begin anew as servants of the people’s House. Here, it is our duty and our privilege to lend a willing ear to the people, to make laws in tune with their priorities and within the limits of their Constitution. 
In recent months, our economy has 
shown signs of improvement, and after difficult years, it may be a temptation to accept what I will call the new nor-mal. But America did not become ex-ceptional by ease. Far too many Amer-icans remain out of work, and too many are working harder only to lose ground to stagnant wages and rising costs. We can do better. We can build an economy that furthers better-pay-ing jobs, more growth, and more oppor-tunity for the Nation’s middle class. This is our vital task. 
We will begin this endeavor on com-
mon ground, both in letter and in spir-it. It was actually my predecessor, Nicholas Longworth of Cincinnati, who changed the order of things so that all Members now take the oath of office at the same time. He called this innova-tion a timesaving device. He sounds like my kind of guy. But this shared ritual is no passing formality. It is a frontier where words end and where deeds begin. 
The pessimists don’t see us crossing 
this channel. They say nothing is going to be accomplished here, that division is wider than ever and so gridlock will be even greater. Frankly, fair enough. Skepticism of our government is healthy and, in our time, quite under-standable. But one problem with say-ing it can’t be done is that it already has been done—or at least started. 
In the last Congress, this House 
passed a number of jobs bills with broad support from the majority and the minority, and we will begin our work on this common ground, taking up measures to develop North Amer-ican energy, restore the hours of mid-dle class workers, and help small busi-nesses hire more of our veterans. We invite the President to support and sign these bipartisan initiatives into law. It will be a good start; and more, it will be a sign that the logjam is breaking, and it will be a foundation on which to address the bigger challenges in the pursuit of freedom and security.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H6 January 6, 2015 
No, this won’t be done in a tidy way. 
The battle of ideas never ends and, frankly, never should. As Speaker, all I ask—and, frankly, expect—is that we disagree without being disagreeable. In return, I pledge to help each of you carry out your duties. My door, of course, is always open. Now don’t get carried away with it—all right?—but it is always open. 
My colleagues, some things we do 
here will be characterized as shadow-boxing and show business, but let me tell you and the American people, it is real work. It is a grind, as it should be, in striving to preserve the things that we all hold dear. 
Every day, you and I come out here, 
try to plant good seeds, cultivate the ground, and take care of the pests; and then, with patience and some sacrifice and God’s grace, there will be a har-vest. Along the way, we may falter, but we Americans do not fall away from the task. We do not quit. 
So let’s stand tall and prove the 
skeptics wrong. Let’s make this a time of harvest, and may the fruits of our labors be ladders our children can use to climb the stairs to the stars. 
Thank you all, and God bless the 
United States of America. 
I am now ready to take the oath of 
office.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H12 January 6, 2015 
also want to thank Chairman S ESSIONS  
for the hard work he has done in put-ting the rules package together today. 
Today, the House will adopt these 
rules to govern the 114th Congress and dictate how this House will function over the next 2 years. As you will hear over the course of this debate, they are a recommitment by the Republican majority to govern transparently. 
The rules ensure that both Members 
and the public have a chance to read bills before they come up for a vote, in-stitute more accurate accounting for the economic effect of legislation, and restore the constitutional balance of power between the legislative and exec-utive branches. 
With these rules in place, the House 
can now proceed in tackling the chal-lenges facing America today and pass legislation that creates jobs, grows the economy, and promotes freedom for all Americans. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the 
rules package. 
Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I want 
to thank the distinguished gentleman from California (Mr. M
CCARTHY ), the 
majority leader. 
Mr. Speaker, I insert for the R ECORD  
a section-by-section analysis of the res-olution as well as a July 21, 2014, memorandum prepared by the Office of the Parliamentarian for the Over- Criminalization Task Force of the Committee on the Judiciary. 
H. R ES. 5 
ADOPTING RULES FOR THE 114THCONGRESS  
SECTION -BY-SECTION ANALYSIS  
Section 1. Resolved Clause. 
This section provides that the Rules of the 
113th Congress are the Rules of the 114th Congress, except with the amendments con-tained in section 2 of the resolution and or-ders contained in sections 3, 4, and 5. 
Section 2. Changes to the Standing Rules. 
Disclosure of Foreign Payments to Witnesses. 
Subsection (a)(1) requires, to the greatest ex-tent practicable, nongovernmental witnesses to disclose payments or contracts to the wit-ness or an organization they represent origi-nating from foreign governments received in the current and preceding two calendar years, to the extent that such information is relevant to the subject matter of, and the witness’ representational capacity at, that hearing. 
While failure to comply fully with this re-
quirement would not give rise to a point of order against the witness testifying, it could result in an objection to including the witness’s written testimony in the hearing record in the absence of such disclosure. 
Jurisdictional Changes. Subsection (a)(2) 
adds language to the Committee on the Judi-ciary’s jurisdictional statement with respect to the criminalization of conduct. 
The Committee on the Judiciary’s jurisdic-
tion over criminal penalties and criminal law enforcement would remain unchanged. That is, the committee would maintain its existing jurisdiction over measures that cre-ate or repeal a crime, and over measures that alter criminal penalties with regard to crimes already existing in law. 
The rules change is intended to cover 
measures that alter the elements of a crime so as to criminalize new conduct and, in so doing, trigger an existing criminal penalty. This rules change is not intended to cover measures that merely supply the regulatory 
framework or address the regulatory underpinnings of the overall enforcement scheme. Past measures proposing merely to adjust the elements of such a crime—as op-posed to adjusting the penalty for commis-sion of the crime—have been out of the juris-dictional reach of the Committee on the Ju-diciary. Even though such measures have left the criminal penalty unchanged, they have nonetheless subjected new conduct to that criminal penalty. In other words, new conduct was criminalized. If the relatively rare practice of criminalizing new conduct within the framework of existing penalties is left unchecked, it calls into question the ef-ficacy of the Committee on the Judiciary’s jurisdictional statement in providing a com-prehensive look at criminal penalties and criminal law enforcement. Hence, a rule X statement of ‘‘criminalization’’ is the most appropriate way to address this cir-cumstance. 
The jurisdiction of other committees over 
the elements of a crime—particularly in the context of a regulatory scheme and outside of title 18, United States Code—would re-main the same, except that it potentially would be shared with the Committee on the Judiciary in some instances. In that respect, it is similar to the criminalization of new conduct accompanied by a new criminal pen-alty; this change is to ensure that it is the act of criminalizing conduct, and not just the penalties themselves, that gives rise to a jurisdictional interest by the Committee on the Judiciary. 
This rules change is not intended to alter 
existing jurisdiction over any enforcement scheme that falls outside of the ambit of criminal law enforcement. Rather, it is to confirm that the creation of a new crime subject to criminal law enforcement is what gives rise to the Committee on the Judi-ciary’s interest, and not merely the estab-lishment or modification of the penalty. 
For instance, the change is intended to ad-
dress a situation analogous to H.R. 2492 of the 112th Congress, which addressed attend-ance at animal fighting events through amendments to the Animal Welfare Act— compiled in title 7 of the United States Code—and to title 18. That measure was re-ferred to both the Committee on Agriculture and the Committee on the Judiciary. Por-tions of that measure were later included in H.R. 2642 of the 113th Congress and addressed a type of animal fighting to be covered by the Animal Welfare Act, but did not amend the existing criminal penalty in the Animal Welfare Act and did not touch title 18. As a result, the Committee on the Judiciary did not receive a referral of that measure. 
Committees with jurisdiction over a regu-
latory statute will continue to exercise that jurisdiction, and the interest of the Com-mittee on the Judiciary will extend to the creation of a new crime without a change to an existing penalty only to the same extent it would to creation of a new crime with an accompanying penalty prior to the 114th Congress. 
The subsection adds language to the Com-
mittee on Appropriations’ jurisdictional statement with respect to certain loan obli-gations and new loan guarantees with a tex-tual reference to section 504(b) of the Con-gressional Budget Act. 
Clarifying the Jurisdiction of the Committee 
on House Administration. Subsection (a)(3) 
clarifies the Committee on House Adminis-tration’s jurisdiction over the Chief Admin-istrative Officer. 
Committee Activity Reports. Subsection (a)(4) 
reduces the frequency of committee activity reports from two times per Congress to one time per Congress. 
Dissenting Views. Subsection (a)(5) codifies 
current practice by updating the rule regard-ing supplemental, minority, or additional 
views to include ‘‘dissenting’’ views. 
Consolidating Requirements for Written Rules. 
Subsection (a)(6) requires committees to in-clude in their written rules pursuant to clause 2(a)(1) of rule XI certain audio and visual coverage rules described in clause 4(f) of rule XI and formerly required by such clause. 
Conforming Committee and House Broad-
casting Standards. Subsection (a)(7) conforms 
the language in clause 4(b) of rule XI with clause 2(c) of rule V to ensure consistent ap-plication of broadcasting standards. 
Eliminating the Point of Order Against Con-
sidering Appropriations Measures without Printed Hearings. Subsection (a)(8) eliminates 
the point of order against the consideration of appropriations measures without printed hearings. This information is largely avail-able through archived broadcasts, testimony, and other documents available on the Appro-priations Committee’s website and the pub-lic hearings themselves. 
Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. 
Subsection (a)(9) increases the size of the committee to 22 members, with not more than 13 from the same party. 
Committee on Ethics. Subsection (a)(10) pro-
hibits the Committee on Ethics from taking action that would deny a person any rights or protections provided under the Constitu-tion of the United States of America. 
Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group. Subsection 
(b) updates the authorization for the Bipar-tisan Legal Advisory Group to conform to current practice and codifies a separate order of the 113th Congress. 
Cost Estimates for Major Legislation to Incor-
porate Macroeconomic Scoring. Subsection (c) 
requires the Congressional Budget Office and Joint Committee on Taxation, to the extent practicable, to incorporate the macro-economic effects of ‘‘major legislation’’ into the official cost estimates used for enforcing the budget resolution and other rules of the House. The subsection requires, to the extent practicable, a qualitative assessment of the long-term budgetary and macroeconomic ef-fects of ‘‘major legislation’’, which is defined to cover legislation that causes a gross budg-etary effect in any fiscal year covered by the 
budget resolution that is equal to or greater than 0.25 percent of the projected GDP for that year. This subsection also allows the chair of the Committee on the Budget, or in the case of revenue legislation the House member serving as the Chair or Vice Chair of the Joint Committee on Taxation, to des-ignate ‘‘major legislation’’ for purposes of this rule. 
This subsection also repeals the existing 
provision in clause 3(h)(2) of rule XIII that requires a macroeconomic impact analysis of revenue legislation, which is superseded by the new rule. 
Providing for Reconvening Authority for the 
House of Representatives. Subsection (d) al-
lows the Speaker, after consultation with the Minority Leader, to reconvene the House during an adjournment of three days or less, at a time other than previously appointed. This codifies separate orders from the 112th and 113th Congresses. 
Providing Conference Committees with Time 
to Reach Agreement. Subsection (e) modifies 
clause 7(c)(1) of rule XXII by providing con-ference committees 45 calendar days and 25 legislative days after the formation of a con-ference to reach agreements before addi-tional motions to instruct managers may be offered. 
Contents of Committee Reports Showing 
Changes to Existing Law. Subsection (f) re-
quires that a Ramseyer print to show the en-tire text of amended or repealed sections of a statute along with the proposed changes. 
Mandatory Ethics Training for New Members. 
Subsection (g) requires that new Members of

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H13 January 6, 2015 
the House, in addition to employees, com-
plete ethics training. 
Technical and Conforming Changes. Sub-
section (h)(1) conforms the standing rules to reflect the name in statute of the Joint Com-mittee on Taxation (JCT). Subsection (h)(2) updates an outdated statutory citation and removes a reference inadvertently left in place at the start of the 113th Congress, which is no longer necessary due to the en-actment of the STOCK Act. 
Section 3. Separate Orders. 
Independent Payment Advisory Board. Sub-
section (a) eliminates provisions contained in the Affordable Care Act that limit the ability of the House to determine the method of consideration for a recommendation from the Independent Payment Advisory Board or to repeal the provision in its entirety. 
Staff Deposition Authority for Certain Com-
mittees. Subsection (b) provides the Commit-
tees on Energy and Commerce, Financial Services, Science, Space, and Technology, and Ways and Means deposition authority to be conducted by a member or committee counsel during the first session of the 114th Congress. Depositions taken under this au-thority shall be subject to regulations issued by the chair of the Committee on Rules and printed in the Congressional Record. 
Providing for Transparency with Respect to 
Memorials Submitted Pursuant to Article V of the Constitution of the United States. Sub-
section (c) clarifies the procedures of the House upon receipt of Article V memorials from the States by directing the Clerk to make each memorial, designated by the chair of the Committee on the Judiciary, electronically available and organized by State of origin and year of receipt. 
In carrying out section 3(c) of House Reso-
lution 5, it is expected that the chair of the Committee on the Judiciary will be solely charged with determining whether a memo-rial purports to be an application of the leg-islature of a state calling for a constitu-tional convention. The Clerk’s role will be entirely administrative. The chair of the Committee on the Judiciary will only des-ignate memorials from state legislatures (and not petitions from individuals or other parties) as it is only state legislatures that are contemplated under Article V of the Con-stitution. 
In submitting the memorials to the Clerk, 
the chair of the Committee on the Judiciary will include a transmission letter with each memorial indicating it has been designated under section 3(c) of House Resolution 5. The Clerk will make publicly available the me-morial and the transmission letter from the chair. Ancillary documentation from the state or other parties is not expected to be publicized. 
The chair of the Committee on the Judici-
ary is also permitted to designate memorials from earlier Congresses to be made publicly available under the same procedure. 
Spending Reduction Amendments in Appro-
priations Bills. Subsection (d) carries forward 
the prohibition from the 112th and 113th Con-gresses against consideration of a general ap-propriation bill that does not include a ‘‘spending reduction’’ account, the contents of which is a recitation of the amount by which, through the amendment process, the House has reduced spending in other portions of the bill and indicated that such savings should be counted towards spending reduc-tion. It provides that other amendments that propose to increase spending in accounts in a general appropriations bill must include an offset of equal or greater value. 
Budget Matters. Subsection (e)(1) provides 
that titles III, IV, and VI, of House Concur-rent Resolution 25 (113th Congress), as well as the allocations, aggregates, and appro-priate levels contained in the chair of the 
Committee on the Budget’s statement sub-mitted in the Congressional Record on April 29, 2014, as adjusted, will continue to have force and effect until a budget resolution for fiscal year 2015 is adopted. This subsection also provides that the chair of the Com-mittee on the Budget may revise allocations, aggregates, and appropriate levels for meas-ures maintaining the Highway Trust Fund, provided such a measure does not increase the deficit over the 11-year window and re-vise allocations, aggregates, and appropriate levels to take into account updated CBO baselines. 
Subsection (e)(2) carries forward from the 
113th Congress the requirement that pre-vents the Committee of the Whole from ris-ing to report a bill to the House that exceeds an applicable allocation of new budget au-thority under section 302(b) (Appropriations subcommittee allocations) as estimated by 
the Budget Committee and creates a point of order. 
Continuing Litigation Authorities. Sub-
section (1) addresses continuing litigation in which the House is a party. Paragraph (1) au-thorizes the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, through the House Of-fice of General Counsel, to continue litiga-tion to enforce a subpoena against the Attor-ney General related to the ‘‘Fast and Furi-ous’’ investigation. This lawsuit was author-ized by H. Res. 706 (112th Congress). It also authorizes the chair of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform (when elected) to take certain actions necessary to continue the litigation. Paragraph (2) au-thorizes the House to act as the successor in interest with respect to ongoing civil actions regarding the implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The law-suit was authorized by H. Res. 676 (113th Con-gress). The subsection also carries forward the authorities provided by H. Res. 676 (113th Congress) to remain in effect in the 114th Congress. Paragraph (3) authorizes Michael W. Sheehy to provide testimony in an ongo-ing criminal action in accordance with au-thorizations from the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence in the 112th and 113th Congresses. 
Duplication of Federal Programs. Subsection 
(g) carries forward from the 113th Congress the authorization of a committee chair to re-quest that the Government Accountability Office perform a duplication analysis of any bill or joint resolution referred to that com-mittee. The subsection also requires com-mittee reports to include a statement on whether any provision of the measure estab-lishes or reauthorizes a program of the Fed-eral Government known to be duplicative of another Federal program. This order has been modified to allow for a statement that no program is being established or reauthor-ized for purposes of complying with the order. 
Estimates of Direct Spending. Subsection (h) 
carries forward from the 113th Congress the prohibition of consideration of a concurrent resolution on the budget, or any proposed amendment to or conference report thereon, unless it includes specified information and estimates related to direct spending, includ-ing means-tested direct spending and nonmeans-tested direct spending. The sub-section also requires the chair of the Com-mittee on the Budget to publish a descrip-tion in the Congressional Record of covered programs 
Disclosure of Directed Rulemakings. Sub-
section (i) carries forward from the 113th Congress the requirement that committee reports on bills or joint resolutions are to in-clude an estimate of the number of directed rule makings required by the measure. The subsection defines ‘‘directed rule making’’ to include those rule makings specifically di-
rected to be completed by a provision in the legislation, but does not include a grant of discretionary rule making authority. 
Subcommittees. Subsection (j) waives clause 
5(d) of rule X to allow the Committees on Armed Services and Foreign Affairs up to seven subcommittees and the Committees on Transportation and Infrastructure and Agri-culture up to six subcommittees. Other than the inclusion of the Committee on Agri-culture, this is similar to provisions carried in the rules package during the last several Congresses. 
Exercise Facilities for Former Members. Sub-
section (k) continues the prohibition on ac-cess to any exercise facility that is made available exclusively to Members, former Members, officers, and former officers of the House and their spouses to any former mem-ber, former officer, or spouse who is a lob-byist registered under the Lobbying Disclo-sure Act of 1995. 
Numbering of Bills. Subsection (1) reserves 
the first 10 numbers for bills (H.R. 1 through H.R. 10) for assignment by the Speaker and the second 10 numbers (H.R. 11 through H.R. 20) for assignment by the Minority Leader. 
Inclusion of U.S. Code Citations. Subsection 
(m) adds, to the maximum extent prac-ticable, a requirement for parallel citations for amendatory instructions to Public Laws and Statutes at Large that are not classified in the U.S. Code. 
Broadening Availability of Legislative Docu-
ments in Machine Readable Formats. Sub-
section (n) instructs the appropriate officers and committees to continue to advance gov-ernment transparency by taking further steps to publish documents of the House in machine-readable formats. 
Temporary Designation. Subsection (o) des-
ignates a temporary location for documents to be made publicly available pending the of-ficial designation by the Committee on House Administration under clause 3 of rule XXIX. 
Congressional Member Organization Trans-
parency Reform. Subsection (p) allows par-
ticipating Members to enter into agreements with eligible Congressional Member Organi-zations for the purpose of payment of sala-ries and expenses. The subsection requires the Committee on House Administration to promulgate regulations, consistent with cur-rent law, to carry out this subsection. 
Social Security Solvency. Subsection (q) cre-
ates a point of order against legislation that would reduce the actuarial balance of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund, but provides an exemption to the point of order if a measure improves the overall financial health of the combined So-cial Security Trust Funds. This subsection would protect the Old-Age and Survivors In-surance (OASI) Trust Fund from diversion of its funds to finance a broken Disability In-surance system. 
Section 4. Committees, Commissions, and House 
Offices. 
Select Committee on the Events Surrounding 
the 2012 Terrorist Attack in Benghazi. Sub-
section (a) carries forward the select com-mittee as authorized by H. Res. 567 (113th Congress) as it existed at the end of the 113th Congress. Additionally, the subsection pro-vides the select committee authority to adopt a rule or motion allowing for a ten- minute rule for the questioning of witnesses. 
House Democracy Partnership. Subsection 
(b) reauthorizes the House Democracy As-sistance Commission, now known as the House Democracy Partnership.

The subsection reaf-firms that a person subject to a review by the Office of Congressional Ethics has a right to be represented by counsel, and establishes that invoking such right is not to be held as a presumption of guilt. The subsection also prohibits the Office of Congressional Ethics from taking action that would deny a person any rights or protections provided under the Constitution of the United States of Amer-ica.

OFFICE OF THE PARLIAMENTARIAN , 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , 
Washington, DC. 
MEMORANDUM  
To: Over-Criminalization Task Force of the 
Committee on the Judiciary. 
From: Office of the Parliamentarian. Date: July 21, 2014. 
The Over-Criminalization Task Force of 
the Committee on the Judiciary is tasked with assessing the current federal criminal statutes and making recommendations for improvements. One of its areas of study is legislative jurisdiction in the House over proposals addressing Federal criminal law. This memo provides guidance on the rules of the House and precedents in this area. 
RULE X —THE JURISDICTIONAL STATEMENT OF  
THE COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY  
The Parliamentarian, acting as the Speak-
er’s agent, refers bills and other matters upon their introduction to committees pur-suant to the jurisdiction of each committee as defined by rule X, taking into account any relevant precedents. Rule XII guides the Speaker in the type and timing of a referral. 
The jurisdiction of each of the 20 standing 
committees of the House is set out in rule X of the rules of the House. The jurisdictional statement of the Committee on the Judici-ary is found in clause 1(l) of rule X. The re-ferral of measures on the subject of criminal-ization is based on clause 1(l)(1) addressing, ‘‘The judiciary and judicial proceedings, civil and criminal,’’ and clause 1(l)(7), addressing ‘‘Criminal law enforcement.’’ 
The jurisdictional statement regarding 
‘‘The judiciary and judicial proceedings, civil and criminal’’ has been in place since the creation of the Committee on the Judiciary in 1813. That statement has been interpreted to apply to matters ‘‘touching judicial pro-ceedings.’’ Hinds, vol. 4, sec. 4054. 
The jurisdictional statement regarding 
‘‘Criminal law enforcement’’ was added in the 109th Congress (sec. 2(a)(2), H. Res. 5, Jan. 4, 2005). This statement has been inter-preted by the Office of the Parliamentarian as a codification of the committee’s existing de facto jurisdiction over legislation address-ing law enforcement powers, consistent with 
the absence of legislative history supplying any other meaning (Cong. Rec. Jan 4, 2005). This area of the committee’s jurisdiction is often manifested in * * * 
REFERRAL PATTERNS  
The issue presented by indirect criminal-
ization can be found in examples spanning many different subject matters. One illustra-tion is in the referrals of the Lacey Act, a frequently amended statute that regulates the trafficking of fish, wildlife, and plants. The Lacey Act is compiled in both title 16 and title 18 of the United States Code. In the case of H.R. 3049 of the 109th Congress (regu-lating the trafficking in Asian carp), the bill amended 18 U.S.C. 42 and addressed criminal-
ization. Accordingly, it was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary. In contrast, H.R. 1497 of the 110th Congress (regulating plants harvested outside the United States) amended various regulatory sections of the Lacey Act Amendments of 1981 that have been compiled in title 16 of the United States Code. The bill extended the Lacey Act’s cov-erage to plants harvested outside the United States and any address of criminalization was indirect. Accordingly, it was referred to the Committee on Natural Resources. 
A more recent example is found in the ani-
mal welfare area. H.R. 2492 of the 112th Con-gress addressed attendance at animal fight-ing events through amendments to the Ani-mal Welfare Act—compiled in title 7 of the United States Code—and to title 18. The bill was referred to both the Committee on Agri-culture and the Committee on the Judiciary. Parts of the contents of this bill were later included in a larger measure in the 113th Congress—H.R. 2642, the Federal Agriculture Reform and Risk Management Act of 2013 (section 11311). The provision addressed a type of animal fighting to be covered by the Animal Welfare Act, but did not amend the existing criminal penalty in the Animal Wel-fare Act and did not touch title 18. The Par-liamentarian advised that a referral to the Committee on the Judiciary was not con-sistent with past precedent. 
Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my friend from Texas for yield-ing me the time, and if I could just take a minute to wish everybody a great new session. It is good to be back. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, we rise today to set a 
new course for this Congress, though, with the record of the past Congresses, we know we have a lot of work to do. 
During their tenure, the majority has 
careened from crisis to crisis, sued the President for doing his job, brought the House to new heights of dysfunction and closed debate with the most closed rules in a single Congress in our Na-tion’s history, chased nonexistent scandals in Benghazi and at the IRS, and, since 2011, had this House vote more than 50 times to take health care away from their own constituents. 
This legacy of dysfunction, of par-
tisanship and prioritizing political games over the public policy has dealt the American people a bad hand. By governing this House in such a hap-hazard way, the majority has closed down the process and shut out the American people. 
Sadly, the majority is poised to dou-
ble down on their partisanship and even reinvent the mathematics of pub-lic policy. By using what is called ‘‘dy-namic scoring’’ to pretend that tax cuts pay for themselves, Republicans will require the nonpartisan Congres-sional Budget Office and Joint Tax-ation Committee to use math that Bruce Bartlett, an economic adviser for both Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, called ‘‘smoke and mirrors.’’ This new math cooks the books in favor of the majority to pre-tend that the tax cut bills are revenue neutral. Time and time again, the falsehoods 
of dynamic scoring have come to light. The first President Bush even called this tactic ‘‘voodoo economics.’’ But even so, the House Republicans want to change the rules and inject their par-tisan ideology into even the mathe-matics which underlies our Nation’s public policy. 
Rising above partisanship, the House 
Democrats will propose today two measures that would do immeasurable good for the American people. 
First, giving average Americans the 
paychecks that they deserve, our com-monsense legislation would deny CEOs the ability to claim tax deductions on incomes over $1 million unless their own employees get a well-deserved raise first. This would ensure that av-erage workers share in the fruit of the Nation’s productivity, not just the mil-lionaires and the billionaires. Today, as our Tax Code stands, CEOs get a break and their workers are left out. The CEOs get the money, the deduction on taxes, and we get the bill to pay for that deduction. It is destroying the middle class. 
Second, Democrats will bring forward 
the Stop Corporate Expatriation and Invest in America’s Infrastructure Act, which prevents U.S. corporations from renouncing their citizenship to dodge paying their fair share of taxes. It is time to stop rewarding companies that 
move overseas and, instead, use those dollars to create good-paying jobs here at home and rebuild our Nation’s crum-bling infrastructure.

By closing this loophole and ending 
the so-called tax inversions, we would raise an estimated $33.6 billion to in-vest in our roads, railways, and bridges which are falling apart all over the country. 
Last fall, I stood by a 100-year-old 
bridge in Bushnell’s Basin that fell into such disrepair that firefighters stopped using it for fear the bridge could not bear the weight of the engines. It en-dangered the safety of the people they were expected to serve. 
In my home State of New York, 40 
percent of the bridges have been rated structurally deficient or functionally obsolete, which is even worse. I wonder what the number is for the United States. 
This is an unconscionable state of af-
fairs. Repairing the Nation’s highways and bridges is now, literally, life or death. We can do it with the Democrat proposals. We can, and we must. 
These are the types of bills that we 
hope to be bringing to the floor in this session of Congress. We will debate them and ultimately pass them. That is what Congress is about, not a legis-lative branch that silences half of this Nation by bypassing the committee process and bringing to Rules emer-gency bills that silence the Representa-tives of half of the people in the United States. 
It is my fervent hope that the new 
Congress will bring about an era of

willingness to tackle the big problems 
facing our Nation, a renewed call for true bipartisanship, and a culture of enlivened debate, and I promise that our side will be a willing partner. 
In describing how the Bill of Rights 
came to be, former Supreme Court Jus-tice, the late Harry Blackmun, said that the Founding Fathers survived a ‘‘crucible of disagreement’’ to give us a more perfect Union. Forging through that crucible is not only good for the legislative branch, but good for the Na-tion. 
Truly, it is the debate that makes us 
stronger, and time and time again, de-bate in the House has been stalled, strangling policies and solutions that could have benefited the Nation. Sadly, this is the legacy of the last Congress. 
I would like to insert the text of Jus-
tice Blackmun’s speech into the R
ECORD . 
HARRY A. BLACKMUN 
ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE UNITED STATES  
SUPREME COURT REMARKS TO THE PHILA-
DELPHIA BARASSOCIATION ‘‘CELEBRATION OF  
THEBICENTENNIAL OF THE BILL OF RIGHTS ’’ 
NOV. 22, 1991 
TRANSCRIPT AVAILABLE IN THE LIBRARY OF  
CONGRESS  
So there you are. Does it bother you that, 
in this Bicentennial year, the Bill of Rights which we regard almost as Holy Writ in our national consciousness, was forged in the crucible of disagreement and contest and tempered by the Founders’ diverse estimates of political reaction? It should not bother us, I submit, for that is the very stuff from which strong constitutions emerge—the les-sons derived from past adversities, from hardening experiences with our fellows and with those who would govern us, and, from the fervent desire to avoid, as Santayana warned us, the necessity of living history over again. Our Constitution and Bill of Rights are of our own making. They are the product of hard bargaining, not the divine gift of a visionary presence. 
My final observation is of a different and 
lighter touch. A great poet, one whom T.S. Eliot once called ‘‘the greatest poet of our times * * * certainly the greatest in this lan-guage, and so far as I am able to judge, in any language,’’ wrote two things that have intrigued me. 
Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, the 
past does not dictate the future. We can right our path forward. We may be able to prioritize that the American people will win over politics; and, today, we have the opportunity to do that with the beginning of this, the 114th Congress. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I, too, want to welcome the gentle-
woman from Rochester, New York, the ranking member of the Rules Com-mittee, as we begin another session in this new year. I am delighted to know that the Rules Committee will be ready and available to handle the pieces of legislation that the gentlewoman spoke of in terms of helping the Amer-ican people to understand what Con-gress’ role is in working with the Presi-dent to help with policies that will get this country back to work. Mr. Speaker, just a year ago, we rec-
ognized as we came back to Wash-ington that we were at a GDP growth of a negative GDP. We had to fight out of these terrible, terrible tax increases and the things that are occurring to our economy. 
The American people found new foot-
ing this year because it was the Repub-lican majority who gave new meaning and life to ‘‘we are going to make this place, meaning Washington, D.C., and government, smaller and make things bigger and better for people back home.’’ 
We have now lived through what has 
become a reality with Republican poli-cies on energy, for a competitive mar-ketplace for there to be alternative fuels that are available that have dominated the marketplaces and put other countries on their heels and have given an advantage to American driv-ers who are here, families who are try-ing to make a go of it. The price of gas-oline at the pump has dropped. 
We still have much to do. As we 
know of the first year that President Obama was in office, food prices began doubling, energy prices began doubling. Republicans now are giving the Amer-ican people a sense that we can manage our country better, so that they cannot only have a job and keep a job, but that they can take care of their fami-lies. 
We are going to aim this year on a 
lot of things; but today, we are here for the rules package that will enable the opportunities for all of our Members to know what the rules are and to become engaged. 
Four years ago, Mr. Speaker, we 
pledged to the American people that Speaker B
OEHNER , through the rules of 
this House and our package that we would have, would allow Members from both sides of the aisle to engage in ro-bust debate under an open process. 
I am proud to announce that in fol-
lowing through with that promise, which is what we have done, we now have a new, larger group of Repub-licans because of the hard work we have done and have sold to the Amer-ican people about effectively managing their affairs in Washington, D.C. 
Republicans have put forth all sorts 
of reforms, not just in the House of Representatives—more transparency, more opportunities for debate—but the opportunity for the American people to see that what we are trying to do is to give the American people a chance to debate and to vote and to move forward legislative ideas, not just about jobs and not just about a better economy and not just about more freedom and not just about trying to take care of energy, but also to protect the men and women who protect this country. The 114th Congress is going to present also an opportunity, I think, for all of us to up our game, to work together. 
The House and the Senate because 
they are in Republican control—in-stead of things being roadblocked and set aside and stacked up—over 300 bills, Mr. Speaker, this past term on which 
we are waiting for Senatorial action— can work together to enact legislation. We can talk with the American people. We can fashion transparency in bills for accountability, something that the 
American people want and need. 
It also represents an opportunity for 
us to jump-start our economy. We are here to serve people back home. We are here to make things better for people back home, not to give away our coun-try, but to make it stronger, a chance to empower people in their commu-nities to make their own decisions and, hopefully, reap the rewards that come from that. 
Many times, it is not just about the 
creation of a job, but really of sus-taining these families who are trying to work and make things happen and make more decisions about themselves and their futures. 
To begin that process today, as we 
open the House for the 114th Congress, we have a rules package. As we begin, I want to say let’s not forget why we are here. We are here because those from our individual congressional dis-tricts sent us here—mine, the 32nd Congressional District of Texas, sent me here to accomplish things on their behalf—to make life better for them, to create better opportunities for people today, and a better America in the fu-ture, so that we are able to extend our lead among other nations with, I be-lieve, American ingenuity and oppor-tunity—American exceptionalism, as we say it in Dallas, Texas, Mr. Speak-er, American exceptional power. 
Whether it is leading in the United 
States military or providing leadership for freedom, that is what we are best at, and we have this privilege by serv-ing in this body. 
We must also be held accountable, I 
believe, to the Constitution. We have, all of us today, raised our hands to sup-port and defend the Constitution of the United States. It doesn’t mean certain parts of that Constitution; it means the Constitution. 
By our being here today, we are, once 
again, reaffirming that in this rules package—the support to the Constitu-tion, that basis of power, that is so im-portant in that we understand the House, the Senate, the Presidency but, most of all, the power that lies with people, the rules package helps us to achieve these goals. 
H. Res. 5 is a continuation of the 
House Republicans’ efforts to stream-line processes, to increase trans-parency, and to improve account-ability. Specifically, it preserves the 
important reforms that were made in the previous two Congresses. It also adds a few perfecting amendments and orders to help further advance our twin goal of transparency and openness for all of the Members of this body. I would like to take a few minutes, if I can, to highlight some of the key parts of this rules package, Mr. Speaker. 
First, it builds upon the fiscal re-
straint imposed upon the Federal Gov-ernment by House Republicans in the 
VerDate Sep 11 2014 00:50 Jan 14, 2015 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00015 Fmt 7634 Sfmt 0634 E:\RECORD15\H06JA5.REC H06JA5SCOATES on DSK6SPTVN1PROD with CONG-REC-ONLINE
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H16 January 6, 2015 
last two Congresses. We have seen in 
the last 4 years that the American economy is able to grow when the gov-ernment shrinks and when less tax-payer money is used to support the government, more freedom and oppor-tunity. We should have a smaller gov-ernment and a larger free enterprise system. That is a goal. ‘‘Limited gov-ernment’’ means unlimited oppor-tunity for people back home. 
In 2011, the Federal Government was 
spending 24 percent of our GDP, and the economy was suffering. Thanks to the leadership of House Republicans, the Federal Government’s spending is now down. In fact, the Federal Govern-ment now spends 19.9 percent of our GDP, which is nearly 5 percent less than just 4 years ago. 
This has come through fiscal re-
straint. This has come through making sure that we spoke to the American people about government that was get-ting too big, costing too much money, and had too much power. The Amer-ican people understood that because the government was getting in the way, not playing its role of making life better for people but, rather, getting in the way and making onerous decisions on our economy, on people’s jobs, and, perhaps worst of all, on stifling fami-lies and the American Dream. 
In turn, we are finally now seeing, as 
a result of these 5 years in which we have held government spending—it has decreased from 24 percent of GDP to 19.9 percent—an economic growth rate that the American people, I think, want and deserve. 
Are we where we want to be? Abso-
lutely not. What is the approximate level? We need a GDP growth of 4 per-cent. We need a GDP growth not just in Dallas, Texas, but all over this country where we have people who in their homes, in their cities, and in their re-gions are able to take care of them-selves, to sustain their economies, and to take care of their infrastructures in a responsible way. 
This Congress, Republicans are going 
to provide for fiscal discipline that re-strains spending and gets the govern-ment out of the way. Getting govern-ment out of the way means you take money away from it which does one of two things: it leaves more money back home for people, or it simply gives peo-ple more opportunity to invest in the marketplace to grow jobs. 
This rules package will ensure that 
Congress has the necessary budget en-forcement tools in place to continue our work that will help create jobs and grow the economy. 
We have a brandnew Budget chair-
man. He is one of the finest members of the Republican Conference, the gen-tleman from Georgia (Mr. P
RICE). Mr. 
PRICE has been not only a professional 
at his job as a physician where he healed people, but he came to Wash-ington to do the same for us. 
His ascension to be the chairman of 
the Budget Committee will offer this country and, I believe, more specifi-cally, this body a reevaluation of the 
important attributes of having a good economy through better budgeting and ways that we can restrain the Federal Government from unwanted and unnec-essary spending to that which is done for the American people that makes sense. T
OMPRICE will become a house-
hold name, and he will earn the acco-lades that he will get from his chair-manship. 
Second, the rules package includes a 
commonsense requirement for Con-gress when we consider legislation that will have a larger impact on our econ-omy. In short, the House is going to re-quire the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation to provide nonpartisan macroeconomic analyses for legislation that costs .25 percent of projected GDP. 
What does this mean? This means 
that, now, we are going to be able to recognize on percentage basis points how close is the impact of our decisions that we make and to project them out to where we are able to actually know what the impact will be of the legisla-tion that we pass in order to create more jobs. 
It is meant to err on the side of peo-
ple and the free enterprise system, as opposed to stymieing what would end up going to them and erring on the side of growing this government. 
b1530 
This means that the House will take 
time to analyze how legislation that we consider will really impact the American economy to where we can project what it will be as a result of in-cluding billions of dollars back into the economy for economic growth and de-velopment on the side of the free enter-prise system. 
This is going to allow us to measure 
the impact of legislation, it is going to 
help us to use some commonsense pro-jections on how our ideas are going to help the bottom line. 
Gosh knows we have been through 4 
years where we saw high taxes, high spending, Big Government that caused America to fall not only in relative power to the rest of the world, but it placed on the American people disillu-sionment, unemployment, high tax-ation, people who could not pay their bills, a loss of their own identity with-in their own systems. 
Unemployment up to 23 million peo-
ple unemployed and underemployed; we have now turned that corner. We will continue to turn that corner and ex-trapolate out how we want to get to all sectors of our economy to have a better shot at jobs in their hometown, in their region, and ones that they can keep, not have and then lose again. 
It is these current opportunities that 
lie right before us, and the gentleman from Georgia and the gentleman, the chairman of the Ways and Means Com-mittee, Mr. R
YAN, are perfectly suited 
for selling to this body and the Amer-ican people why we believe that we have got to look at and change the way we authorize bills. So under one method, which would be 
called static scoring, which is what we have, we assume that major legislation does not change economic behavior. They just plug a new number in, and then we assume nothing really hap-pens. 
But in fact we know when you raise 
taxes, you lower the opportunity for people not only to create more eco-nomic benefit, but you take that incen-tive away. 
Our friends, the Democrats, would 
leave you to believe that taxation is a zero sum game, that when rates go up, revenues always come that way, and aren’t we for making sure that we bal-ance our budget? 
Well, let me tell you what? It didn’t 
work that way. We were spending hun-dreds of billions of dollars more. In-stead of an economy that was working, we were paying unemployment com-pensation—people not to be employed, people to be at home, a terrible cost not only to humanity but also to our Treasury. 
We need people to go to work, and en-
couraging them to do this through our Tax Code means that people can have the dignity of work, the opportunity to make their life better, and perhaps more importantly, a chance for Amer-ica to grow its GDP. 
We have examples over and over that 
we have seen about how taxation legis-lation affects behavior, and certainly in my home State of Texas, I remember in the 1980s and the early 1990s, when revenue was at a premium for the Democrats who ran our House and Sen-ate in Texas, and of course they wanted to raise more revenue, and they were always looking for ways to raise rev-enue. 
I remember them looking when I was 
just out of high school at personalized license plates, and they looked at how much money came in for personalized license plates. I want to say it was $30 for the plates. They needed more rev-enue, so they just doubled that amount of money that it would cost, knowing they would get twice as much revenue. 
But it didn’t work that way, Mr. 
Speaker. Not surprisingly, fewer Tex-ans bought more license plates. But to the Democrats, it was a simple matter under static scoring of just saying they wanted more money, and they were going to increase the rates. It doesn’t happen that way because the American people or citizens understand they would no longer buy something at a different rate. 
The same thing is true of tax rates, 
Mr. Speaker. We have the exact same 
problem, where people who are working and working hard, when you take away their money, there is less money that they can put into the economy to grow another job, to give somebody a chance at a new job. 
These are the things we are going to 
be looking at, how we can maximize through the effort of Dr. P
RICE, 
through the effort of P AUL RYAN, the 
Ways and Means Committee, the Budg-et Committee to bring the leading edge

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H17 January 6, 2015 
ideas instead of saying, no, it is really 
a zero sum game. If you want to do something, you have to really raise taxes; you can’t give money back to people because, oh my gosh, the Fed-eral Government would be in trouble. Well, we are not. 
It would change from unemployment 
compensation to people working, and Republicans believe in work. We be-lieve in empowering communities and people standing a chance to go from 
unemployment and welfare to a chance to have a job. We are going to get this done. 
Let me be clear. Republicans are not 
arguing that tax cuts always pay for themselves. They don’t. But instead we are acknowledging that when it is done right, when you study what you are doing, you can make an effort to have a tax cut to grow the economy. I be-lieve Republicans understand that the American economy and Americans are better off when they keep more of their paychecks. 
Lastly, this rules package defends 
the House’s constitutional role in our system of checks and balances by pro-viding for continuation of legal actions against the executive branch. It will allow the House to pursue its lawsuits and to enforce subpoenas, for instance, in the Fast and Furious investigation, where we have seen guns that were sold by the United States Government and put into hands of very dangerous peo-ple all around our world, including in Mexico and other places, only to find they come back and appear where they were involved in murders in the United States. It is a lawless action that was taken by our Department of Justice. It is wrong, and we are going to continue pursuing this. 
So it means that we are going to look 
at those things that this Federal Gov-ernment is doing that we believe are unconstitutional and should change also. We also believe in a lawsuit against the executive branch regarding the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. In short, this package makes it perfectly clear that our constitu-tional order still matters, and it is Congress’ job to write the law and for the President to faithfully execute it. We are not going to stand by and watch this President go and write laws and to execute them down the block. We are going to make sure we do it the way the Constitution spoke about. 
Certainly we know that IPAB, which 
is a part of the President’s package, where he has this group of people that have unlimited power to make deci-sions over health care, over people as opposed to a physician, we are going to limit that authority. We believe we are within the right in doing this because the American people want and need a health care system that works, not one that we cannot afford and we cannot find a doctor, and where the govern-ment and a bureaucrat make decisions as opposed to a physician and a pa-tient. 
Regardless of what one thinks about 
ObamaCare, all Members of Congress should be united to preserve and pro-
tect the role of the House of Represent-atives and our ability to make the laws on behalf of people and work with the President in that. 
Finally, the package is going to 
allow the Speaker to recognize Mem-bers for the reading of the Constitution on any legislative day through January 16, 2015. I believe it is vital. We saw this several years ago, Mr. Speaker, where we came down to the floor of the House and took turns at reading the Constitution. It is a vital part of our history. It is important that we under-stand it serves this great Nation that separates us from so many other coun-tries, the rule of law and constitutional guidance. 
This rules package that I have out-
lined will better enable the House to perform our duties. It will help us with our obligations, our integrity, and transparency and accountability, and it is going to help us to make sure that we work well together with each other. 
Our friends, whether they are Repub-
licans or Democrats, elected Members of this body, I am very proud to say that this resolution represents so many great things. I think it is a balanced package, and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to yield 4 minutes to the gen-tleman from Maryland (Mr. H
OYER ), 
the Democratic whip. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlelady for yielding. Unfortu-nately, I don’t have time to respond to many of the representations that Mr. S
ESSIONS made with reference to our 
economy, but we can all agree that our most important responsibilities as Members of Congress is to grow this economy, create the kinds of jobs that Americans need so that they can suc-ceed and support themselves and their families. 
I want to speak about a couple of 
things in this rules package. Tradition-ally, Democrats will vote against and Republicans will vote for because tra-ditionally this is a partisan vote. I urge the Rules Committee chairman to adopt a couple of changes which I thought would make this rules package a better one. 
First, I ask the House to move to ban 
discrimination against gay, lesbian, bi-sexual, and transgender employees. We provide in our rules that you cannot discriminate against people based upon race, nationality, gender, and other ar-bitrary distinctions. We should have added this as we have in so many of our laws. Currently there are no protec-tions for a congressional staffer fired or refused promotion simply for LGBT status. I regret that the Rules Com-mittee was unprepared to offer such a protection to our employees. 
Secondly, since Republicans assumed 
the majority in 2011, Delegates from the District of Columbia, the U.S. Vir-gin Islands, Guam, Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands as well as the Resident Commissioner from Puer-to Rico have been denied the oppor-
tunity to vote in the Committee of the Whole. They can vote in committees, and the Committee of the Whole is of course a committee of the House. It is not a final arbiter. 
When I was majority leader, I offered 
that amendment in the rules. It passed. My Republican friends took it to court, and the court said that it was sustain-able and sustained it. This effectively, unfortunately, denies representation to nearly 5 million Americans, Ameri-cans, one of whom is on the Republican side of the aisle from American Samoa. So this is a bipartisan concern that I have. Unfortunately, this rules pack-age put forward by the Republican ma-jority does not include either change. 
In addition, this rules package does 
not live up to the responsible gov-erning the American people expect and deserve from Congress. Mr. S
ESSIONS  
spent a long time talking about scor-ing, static scoring versus dynamic scoring. 
Dynamic scoring I would suggest to 
the American people is a gamble. It is a gamble that your projection is cor-rect. If your projection is not correct, as it has so often been, then you end up putting the deficit even higher because you bet on the come. 
The more conservative policy, I 
would suggest, would be to get the money first and then decide how you are going to apply it. Don’t gamble on the fact that you are going to get the money, which is what dynamic scoring is. The gentleman admitted—he did not argue—that cutting taxes always paid for themselves. In fact, Alan Greenspan said exactly that in the last decade. 
What it means is the Republicans 
will be able to hide the true cost of tax cuts behind a debunked mantra that tax cuts pay for themselves. They do not. This provision will allow them to explode the deficit as they did the last time they were in charge. 
The last time the budget was bal-
anced was not under the Bush adminis-tration when you had a Republican Congress, a Republican Senate, and a Republican President. It was when Bill Clinton was President of the United States. For 4 years we had a balanced 
budget. 
It also threatens to politicize the 
Congressional Budget Office, which has maintained its role as impartial and nonpartisan arbiter on budget scoring for four decades, which makes us be honest, which is what the American public expects. Rely on the figures that are not political figures but are inde-pendent analytical figures on which we can rely. 
I urge my colleagues to vote against 
this rules package. It can be a better package; it should be. And if it is de-feated, we can adopt a better, more fair package. 
Mr. Speaker, we are at the start of a new 
Congress, and we have an opportunity to right two wrongs in the rules of this House. 
I wrote to the Chairman of the Rules last 
month asking that two changes be made in to-day’s rules package.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H18 January 6, 2015 
First, I asked that the House move to ban 
discrimination against gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender employees. 
Currently, there are no protections for a 
Congressional staffer fired or refused a pro-motion simply for LGBT status. 
Second, since Republicans assumed the 
majority in 2011, delegates from the District of Columbia, U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands, as well as the Resident Commissioner from Puerto Rico, have been denied the opportunity to vote in the Committee of the Whole House. 
This effectively denies representation to 
nearly 5 million Americans. 
Unfortunately, this rules package, put for-
ward by the Republican majority, does not in-clude either change. 
In addition, this rules package does not live 
up to the responsible governing the American people expect and deserve from their Con-gress. 
First, it includes something called ‘‘Dynamic 
Scoring.’’ 
What it means is that Republicans will be 
able to hide the true cost of tax cuts behind a debunked mantra that ‘‘tax cuts pay for themselves.’’ 
They do not—and this provision will allow 
them to explode the deficit, as they did the last time they were in charge. 
It also threatens to politicize the Congres-
sional Budget Office, which has maintained its role as impartial and nonpartisan arbiter on budget scoring for four decades. 
The rules package also extends the 
Benghazi select committee, placing conspiracy theories above fact. 
At least three committees—two led by Re-
publicans—exhaustively investigated the Benghazi tragedy. 
Everything has been reviewed; a million dol-
lars in taxpayer money last year were wasted. 
And, furthermore, these rules would limit the 
ability of Congress to reallocate resources be-tween Social Security trust funds, making it more difficult to prevent automatic cuts to So-cial Security disability insurance. 
We can do better—and should do better— 
in this House for the 114th Congress. 
I urge my colleagues to reject this rules 
package, and I call on Chairman S
ESSIONS  
and his Republican colleagues to work in a bi-partisan way with Democrats to enact rules that enhance the work of this House, protect LGBT employees, include all of the voices in our democracy, and set guidelines that facili-tate greater cooperation, not more partisan gridlock. 
Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gen-tleman from Maryland (Mr. V
ANHOL-
LEN), the distinguished returning rank-
ing member of the Committee on the Budget. 
b1545 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my colleague. 
Mr. Speaker, it is absolutely as-
tounding that within minutes—min-utes—of our being sworn in, our Repub-lican colleagues want to pass a rule that will stack the deck in favor of try-ing to give another big tax cut not to the middle class, but to millionaires, the folks at the very top. That is what 
their budget does. 
What is equally astounding is that 
this economic theory of trickle-down economics crashed and burned in the real world between 2001 and 2008. Our Republican colleague says that if you give millionaires these tax cuts, they are going to spend them, and a little bit will trickle down to the middle class and people who aspire to the mid-dle class and boost everybody up. 
That is not what happened. What 
happened? Sure, the folks who got the tax cuts at the top, they did better. No-body else did. In fact, real wages went down. What went up? The deficit—and everybody has to pay for that deficit. 
Now, I heard the Speaker this morn-
ing say he wanted to deal with the issue of wage stagnation. That is what we should be focused on. We shouldn’t be talking about tax cuts for the wealthy and a trickle-down theory. We should try to build this economy from the middle class out and from the bot-tom up. 
I am glad the Speaker said that be-
cause we are going to give him an op-portunity to vote for something that will address wage stagnation. I am going to offer a motion at the end of this debate. It is called the CEO-Em-ployee Paycheck Fairness Act, and it addresses this issue. 
If you look back in the 1960s and 
1970s, when workers were working hard, they got paid more, but beginning around 1979, they kept working hard, productivity kept going up, but their wages got flat. What happened during the same time? CEOs took care of themselves. Their pay started to go up and up and up. It used to be about 20 times that of the average worker. 
In other words, the CEO and the folks 
at the top got about 20 times what they were paying their employees, but as you can see, it has now shot up so that CEOs and the top guys get paid about 300 times what their workers are get-ting paid. 
We have a simple proposition: that 
corporations should not be able to de-duct the bonuses and compensation for their CEOs and other executives over $1 million unless they are giving their employees a fair shake, a fair wage. Right? Why should the taxpayers be subsidizing that? 
Between 2007 and 2010, they took 
about $66 billion, thereabouts, in de-ductions for bonuses for performance pay when they were sometimes laying off employees and cutting their pay-checks, so we say: ‘‘Hey, okay, pay yourselves what you want, but if you want the taxpayers to allow you to de-duct your bonuses and performance pay, for goodness’ sakes, you had bet-ter be giving your employees a fair shake.’’ 
Over time, that would close that gap 
in worker productivity and wages and do what the Speaker said he wanted to do this morning, which is deal with wage stagnation. Let’s help the work-ers, not just the CEOs. Let’s vote for the CEO-Employee Paycheck Fairness 
Act. 
Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, there 
they go again, more tax increases, big-ger government, the Democrat party. I reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. V
ANHOLLEN ) to respond 
to that. 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Actually, what 
we are talking about, Mr. Speaker, is a Republican plan that actually cuts the top rate for folks at the top from 39 percent to 25 percent. 
The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center 
has said that will actually leave the middle class family—typical family— paying another $2,000, so that you can give the folks at the very top another tax break. 
When you increase the deficit, guess 
who pays the bill? Everybody, all the taxpayers do. So you give a tax break to the folks at the top, increase the deficit, and everybody else is left to pay the bill. That is not the right way to go. Vote for this motion. 
Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gen-tlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. D
ELAURO ), who has been successful al-
ready about inversions. 
Ms. D ELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
opposition to the Republican rule pack-age and to the previous question. If we defeat that question, Ms. S
LAUGHTER  
will offer an amendment to end cor-porate desertion. 
Over the last decade, we have seen 
nearly 50 American companies try to avoid taxes by moving their mailboxes overseas, but they leave their oper-ations here, effectively renouncing their U.S. citizenship in order to dodge taxes. 
These companies benefit from Amer-
ican education, research and develop-ment incentives, and infrastructure, all taxpayer supported, but when their own tax bill arrives, they hide overseas and are no longer American corpora-tions. 
They even have the temerity—and 
this is legal under the law today, and it shouldn’t be—they have the temerity then to apply for Federal contracts, but they deny their U.S. citizenship when it comes to paying their taxes. 
Mr. Speaker, what this amendment 
would do is make sure that they pay their fair share. The extra revenue goes to the highway trust fund. That trust fund runs out of money in May if we do not act. Anyone who has driven a car lately knows how badly our roads need investment. 
Our highways are crumbling beneath 
our wheels, 65 percent of our major roads are in less than good condition, and one-quarter of our bridges require repair or improvements. The backlog of projects grows longer by the day. 
At a time when globalization is gath-
ering pace, this state of affairs puts America’s competitiveness in jeopardy.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H19 January 6, 2015 
According to the World Economic 
Forum, the United States has slipped from 7th to 18th in the quality of our roadways. Replenishing the highway trust fund will reverse this trend, un-leash economic growth, and create thousands of good jobs that cannot be sent overseas. 
If we want business to invest in this 
Nation, we must be prepared to do the same. Instead of lining the pockets of corporate deserters, we should be revi-talizing our roadways. That is the path to a better, stronger, and more sustain-able economy. This amendment puts us back on the right track. 
Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gen-tleman from South Carolina (Mr. C
LY-
BURN ), the assistant Democratic leader. 
Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, like most Americans, I 
spent the holidays with family and friends reflecting on the blessings of the past year. There were many. 
Since 2009, the stock market has 
soared another 10,000 points. In 2009, our budget deficit stood at $1.4 trillion. Today, according to current projec-tions, we have sliced that deficit to 
$514 billion, and we have created 10 mil-lion new jobs, the longest stretch of private sector job growth in American history. 
When I left home yesterday, I left my 
wife with a full tank of gas, and I did so paying less than $2 per gallon. It was the first time I have been able to do that in 5 years. We have achieved much progress over the past several years. Now, we must get about the work of making sure that progress is shared by all. 
Mr. Speaker, in a few moments, we 
will cast some substantive votes. These votes will literally set the rules of the game for the next 2 years. They will be a very clear reflection of our respective parties’ priorities. 
While Republicans’ rules changes 
seem to rig the game in favor of the wealthy, Democrats will immediately 
force a vote on job creation, bigger paychecks for working families, and American competitiveness and eco-nomic growth. 
Democrats want to put people to 
work building roads and bridges that will connect our economy in the 21st century. We will ensure that every American shares in our Nation’s pros-perity by taking away corporate tax deductions for millionaire executive compensation unless their employees get a raise as well. 
It is simple, Mr. Speaker. House Re-
publicans’ first priority in the 114th Congress is stacking the deck for those with the highest incomes and for voo-doo, trickle-down economics. House Democrats’ first priority is to put Americans in a better place by creating jobs, standing up for working families, and growing the economy for all. The contrast could not be more stark. Mr. Speaker, House Democrats’ num-
bers may be smaller in the 114th, but we are stronger in our unity and re-solve to grow and strengthen middle income Americans. Today, with our votes on the new rules, Mr. Speaker, we will be demonstrating our support for hardworking American families. 
Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gen-tleman from Massachusetts (Mr. M
CGOVERN ), a valued member of the 
Committee on Rules. 
Mr. M CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the distinguished ranking mem-ber for the time. 
Mr. Speaker, I suppose I should sim-
ply take this time to say to my col-leagues: welcome back, happy new year, and I missed you. 
Technically, we are considering, de-
bating, and voting on the Republican majority’s ‘‘rules package,’’ but that is sort of a misnomer. The word ‘‘rules,’’ as most of us understand it, means a set of procedures that someone is re-quired to follow, but if my Republican friends have demonstrated anything over the past few years, it is that they have absolutely no intention of fol-lowing the rules of the House. They routinely waive, ignore, or break the rules of this House whenever it is con-venient or politically expedient for them to do so. 
The gentleman from Texas says the 
Speaker of the House promised the most open Congress in history. I hate to remind him that the Republicans presided over the most closed Congress in history during the 113th Congress. 
Let me just mention a couple of the 
most egregious provisions in this pack-age before us today. First, my Repub-lican friends believe we should adopt the voodoo economics of so-called dy-namic scoring. Under this fairy tale, they would have us believe that tax cuts for the very wealthy don’t in-crease the deficit. Never mind that time after time after time in our his-tory, those tax cuts for the rich have caused an explosion in our deficit. This rules package would have us believe that up is down and left is right. 
Second, this package would allow 
committee staff from the Ways and Means Committee, Financial Services, Energy and Commerce, and the Science Committee to take depositions under oath. Currently, only the Oversight Committee has that authority. 
Mr. Speaker, I served as a staff mem-
ber in this House for the late Congress-man Joe Moakley. Our staff members are dedicated public servants who work incredibly hard, but this provision, quite frankly, goes too far. 
Mr. Speaker, we ought to be spending 
our time on rebuilding our aging infra-structure and increasing workers’ pay-checks rather than making it easier to conduct more political witch hunts, which the American people are fed up with. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to serve 
on the Rules Committee, and that word ‘‘rules’’ used to mean something. My hope is that in this Congress, enough of my Republican colleagues will dem-onstrate the political courage to make it mean something again. 
Vote ‘‘no’’ on this resolution. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. D
OGGETT ). 
Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, to those 
who have wondered, what would be the top priority of this Republican-con-trolled Congress? What would they do on day one? Well, now we know. It is deception, what some could even right-ly call tax fraud, since this amounts to deliberate misrepresentation of tax data. 
Republicans are admitting right here 
on day one that they don’t know how to balance the budget. When the budget numbers will not add up, when the arithmetic just doesn’t work for them, they change the numbers with magical new math. Where the books won’t bal-ance with the numbers that you have got, Republicans say, ‘‘Use the num-bers you would like to have.’’ 
All their previous talk about budget 
discipline and balancing budgets was really about trying to dismantle Demo-cratic efforts to provide an opportunity ladder up for all Americans, to assure dignity in retirement, and to protect families from the risk of illness—that ladder of security and protection that many Republicans were never for in the first place. 
Now, to free themselves from the 
hard work of responsible, balanced budgets, Republicans are compelling the House for the first time in Amer-ican history to rely upon something they call ‘‘dynamic scoring’’—That is just a euphemism for whimsy, specula-tion, and wishful thinking—the thin veneer for a failed political ideology. 
One leading Republican expert, 
former Senate budget staff director Bill Hoagland, has said that instead of this scoring gimmick that they are using today, he would ‘‘rather [they] just simply belly up to the bar’’ and ‘‘admit up front that they can’t lower rates without adding to the deficit.’’ 
b1600 
Today’s actions remind me of a riddle 
some attribute to President Abraham Lincoln: ‘‘How many legs does a dog have if you call the tail a leg? Four, be-cause calling a tail a leg doesn’t make it a leg.’’ 
And calling a budget ‘‘balanced’’ 
when it doesn’t have adequate revenue does not make it so. 
Passing a budget requires hard work. 
Republicans would rather use a sleight of hand than offer a helping hand from all to get the job done. Vote no. 
Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, in fact, 
Republicans are going to use a doctor to get the budget done this time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H20 January 6, 2015 
I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman 
from Georgia (Mr. P RICE), the young 
chairman from the Budget Committee. 
Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I thank the 
gentleman from Texas for his leader-ship on this package and his work throughout this Congress. 
Mr. Speaker, I am actually sur-
prised—well, I am not surprised. I thought we might actually go a day without having the kind of hyperbole that we have grown used to from the other side of the aisle. 
I want to speak to the issue of mac-
roeconomic analysis as the incoming chair of the Budget Committee. The other side has said this is a gamble, that we are gambling that the projec-tions are going to be correct. Mr. Speaker, this is craziness. That is not so. In fact, all economic projections— static, dynamic—all of them have a level of uncertainty. 
We have heard that it is ‘‘stacking 
the deck’’ or that it is ‘‘cooking the books’’ in favor of tax cuts. Nonsense. Nonsense. It doesn’t game the system at all. All we are trying to do is make certain that Members of Congress have more information upon which to be able to make decisions. That is the kind of commonsense things that our folks back home want. 
Scoring, which is what we are talk-
ing about here, the Congressional Budget Office works hard to try to de-termine what the effect is of the kind of policies that we adopt around here. They will tell you right now that now it is inaccurate. Now it is inaccurate. What we are trying to do is simply say that if a piece of legislation is going to have a large effect on the economy, that we include that effect in the offi-cial estimate. 
So if you think a bill is going to help 
or hurt the economy—help or hurt the economy—then they ought to tell us. They ought to let us know how many more jobs are going to be created, what kind of tax revenue up or down is going to occur. Is it going to harm jobs? The people who prepare our cost estimates, I tell you, they are the best in the busi-ness, and they have been working on this issue for years. 
Mr. Speaker, this may come as some 
surprise to our friends on the other side, but they already do this kind of analysis. They already do the macro-economic analysis. It is just that we don’t include it in our cost estimate because of the rules. And we should. That is why we are offering this change today. 
We don’t predetermine the outcome. 
We simply make it so that the Congres-sional Budget Office is allowed, the scorekeepers are allowed, to have a more realistic score. It has come as no surprise, talking to economists from around the country over the past cou-ple of weeks, over the past couple of months, and to a person they say eco-nomic scoring, the effects of legislation that we pass, it is an inaccurate science. It is hard to do. But what we want to do is to make certain that they have greater opportunity to get 
that scoring correct, to give us the kind of information so we can make wiser decisions. 
Mr. Speaker, this isn’t about cooking 
the books or gaming the system. This is about trying to do the hard work of the American people, trying to get the policies that we adopt here in this Con-gress correct so that we can get the American people back to work and get this economy thriving again. 
I commend the gentleman from 
Texas for the work that he has done and urge adoption of the rules. 
Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gen-tleman from California (Mr. B
ECERRA ), 
the chairman of the Democratic Cau-cus. 
Mr. BECERRA. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlelady for yielding. 
It is time to get to work. Americans 
don’t care who won or lost in the elec-tion. They just want us to get our work done. They want us to work together to solve the problems that they see every day. They want us to boost job growth, and they want us to build an economy that works for all Americans, not just the privileged few. 
The rules of the road that should 
guide this Congress should be built on the foundation that has increased op-portunities for American families over the last few years—nearly 11 million new jobs, 57 consecutive months of job growth, the longest streak in our coun-try’s history. There are 10 million more Americans with health insurance, which means more security for those Americans. The deficit has been cut by two-thirds since 2009. 
What is the one piece of the puzzle 
that we now need to work on? In that span of time since we have seen things go better; the economy has grown 12 percent; corporate profits have grown by 46 percent, and the stock market by 92 percent. What hasn’t grown? The paycheck that the average American gets day in and day out for working to do all those things to make it possible for the stock market and corporations to succeed. So it is time for us to focus on the middle of America that works hard every month and gets a paycheck but doesn’t see that paycheck grow. 
This rules package requires Congress 
to use fuzzy math, so-called dynamic scoring, to make it easier to give mas-sive tax breaks to special interests and the wealthy. Is that what the middle class wants? No. 
Republicans have also added a mid-
night change to this rules package that rigs the rules against 59 million Ameri-cans who currently receive Social Se-curity and to the 160 million Ameri-cans who are working today to get So-cial Security in the future and don’t know if Social Security will be there based on these rules. That is not what Americans in the middle want. 
Congress should be in the business of 
making life better, not worse, for ev-eryday Americans. So let’s establish rules of the road for this Congress that let us build on the economic progress 
of nearly 11 million new Americans going back to work, 57 months straight of job growth. 
What we don’t need are rules of the 
road for this House that give a green light to reckless legislating that favors special interests and the privileged few at the expense of the middle class and America’s Social Security. 
Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to yield 1 minute to the gen-tleman from Michigan (Mr. L
EVIN), the 
distinguished returning ranking mem-ber of the Ways and Means Committee. 
Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, what was 
said by the Budget Committee chair-man is not correct. This is not about more information. This is a require-ment that these official cost estimates really be part of the enforcement of the budget resolution. So what this is, in a few words: Republicans today are ex-tending their embrace of voodoo eco-nomics by wrapping their arms around voodoo score keeping. Again, it is not about more information. It is being able to cook the books to implement their long-held discredited notion that tax cuts pay for themselves. 
I think the former Reagan and 
George H.W. Bush administration offi-cial Bruce Bartlett said it best: 
It is not about honest revenue estimating. 
It is about using smoke and mirrors to insti-tutionalize Republican ideology in the budg-et process. 
Mr. Speaker, that is what this is all 
about. 
Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, may 
I inquire from my colleague if he has any remaining speakers. 
Mr. SESSIONS. I do have one addi-
tional speaker, and then I will close. 
Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. P
ELOSI ), the 
Democratic leader. 
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlelady for yielding, and I thank her for her wonderful work on behalf of the American people as the ranking member on the Rules Committee for such a long time and in such a very strong way. 
My colleagues, I congratulate you 
and your families on your swearing in today. We had a lovely ceremony ear-lier. Eventually it became that, after we knew the outcome of the vote. But it is clear that the election at the polls in November demonstrated that the American people are hopeful that this new Congress can work together to grow our economy and, in turn, grow paychecks for American workers. Hon-oring that trust, House Democrats today are putting forward a legislative package to increase paychecks for working families and put Americans back to work building the roads and bridges our country needs, paid for by keeping our tax dollars here at home.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H21 January 6, 2015 
talked about this a little bit earlier 
when I introduced the Speaker. 
What we are proposing, sadly, is in 
sharp contrast to what the Republicans have in this rule. The first vote that the Republicans are asking this Con-gress to take in the new Congress will be to advance additional tax cuts for the wealthy and special interests. When they talk about dynamic scor-ing—when they talk about dynamic scoring—it is a very bad deal for mid-
dle-income families in our country. 
In sharp contrast to them, we will 
bring forth the Stop Corporate Expa-triation and Invest in America’s Infra-structure Act, which prevents U.S. cor-porations from renouncing their citi-zenship in order to dodge paying their fair share of taxes. It is time to stop re-warding companies that move overseas and instead use those dollars to create good-paying jobs here at home. 
Every chance any of us gets, we have 
to make that point. I don’t see any-thing partisan about it. And many Re-publicans have voted in this manner in the past. So this was supposed to be something where we have common ground. 
House Democrats will also put forth 
the CEO-Employee Pay Fairness Act, and that is legislation to ensure that workers share in the fruit of their pro-ductivity, denying CEOs the ability to claim tax deductions on income over $1 million unless they give their employ-ees a well-deserved raise. 
The American people are owed an 
open and transparent debate on these issues. Today, with this rules package, Republicans are shutting down debate for Democrats and Republicans. With their extending of the amount of time it takes for Members to put forth a mo-tion to instruct, they are shutting down debate. They are rejecting trans-parency and openness. That is what the American people want: transparency and openness. 
In all that we do in Congress, we 
must keep the hopes, dreams, and aspi-rations of the American people in the forefront. We must be committed to do this is a bipartisan way, an open and transparent way. This bill today re-jects that. 
Now what I want to say, and we all 
have been reading our Christmas cards and all the rest, but one of the ones that I want to share with you which is irrelevant to our discussion today is from my friend Jack Trout. What he said in ‘‘A Seasonal Greeting for the Times’’: 
To borrow a Biblical reference, the money 
changers have taken over the temple. 
What is behind all of this is a concerted ef-
fort by wealthy companies and people to pro-tect the status quo and their vested inter-ests. The result is the sad fact that the mid-dle class gets squeezed while the rich get richer. This squeeze is why the consumer-led economy has been so slow to rebound after the financial crisis. 
What people fail to realize is the simple 
fact that the middle class are the real job creators in America. They generate demand, which, in turn, builds markets. The middle class put ‘‘merry’’ into Merry Christmas. I mention this because the fact is 
that it is true that when the consumer economy, which is what we are, is alive and well and thriving, they spend money, inject demand in the economy, create jobs, and our economic recovery is accelerated. 
Dynamic scoring, suppressing debate, 
and some of the other things contained in this rule are contrary to that and antagonistic to the financial stability of the middle class. So I hope that our colleagues—and there are so many rea-sons to go through. But what means the most to America’s working fami-lies is their financial stability. On that subject alone, were it not even for other things in this bill which we could talk about all day that should be re-jected, but just because it, again, has a negative impact on the growth of our economy when it comes to supporting the financial stability of the middle class we should vote ‘‘no’’ on this. 
The Democrats offer a sharp con-
trast. The motion that will be made to call the previous question is one that calls for us to talk about building the infrastructure of America. The motion to commit that will be put forth by Mr. V
ANHOLLEN is one that is fair in terms 
of pay to our workers. 
So for many reasons, Mr. Speaker, I 
urge our colleagues to vote ‘‘no.’’ This isn’t what was talked about in terms of ideals and values this morning. This is about putting the squeeze on the mid-dle class, doing it in a nontransparent way, and doing it under the rules of the House. I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote. 
Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gen-tleman from New York (Mr. I
SRAEL ). 
b1615 
Mr. ISRAEL. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my friend from New York, the distin-guished ranking member. 
Mr. Speaker, I congratulate all of my 
colleagues on our swearing in. I just hope that it doesn’t trigger 2 years of swearing at. It really does not have to be that way, Mr. Speaker. Democrats in this House will work with the major-ity to find commonsense solutions to ease the squeeze, to support paycheck growth for the middle class. 
What better middle ground than the 
middle class, Mr. Speaker. The problem with this rules package is it is stacked against the middle class, it is stacked against tax cuts for the middle class, it is stacked against paycheck growth for the middle class. 
In contrast, Mr. Speaker, here is 
what House Democrats are proposing. It is very simple. 
Number one, bigger paychecks for 
the middle class. Under the current rules that the majority supports, Mr. Speaker, a CEO can get a million-dol-lar bonus and deduct that million dol-lars from taxes. That shifts that tax burden to an underpaid worker for that CEO. Now, how is that fair? How is that fair? It is not. It is bad enough that middle class 
workers’ paychecks are squeezed, but sticking the middle class worker with a bill for the CEO’s taxes as a result of that million dollar bonus is uncon-scionable. We have a better way, a bet-ter contrast, something that will grow paychecks for the middle class. 
Second, under the rules, in the 
stacked deck that the majority sup-ports, a big corporation can ship jobs overseas. With those jobs overseas go bigger bridges, better roads, better air-ports, and faster airplanes. Meanwhile, in my district on Long Island, Mr. Speaker, the average middle class worker has to drive through potholes, has longer delays, slower trains, anti-quated transportation systems, and de-layed airplanes because all of the infra-structure is being built abroad. 
It is bad enough that corporations 
are given incentives to ship jobs over-seas. It is unconscionable that under these rules those corporations are able to build infrastructure in those foreign places while America decays. 
Under our contrast, Mr. Speaker, we 
will invest in America, we will rebuild America, we will create new jobs in America, improving our infrastructure. 
It is bad enough to be underpaid, Mr. 
Speaker, but to be underpaid and have to drive through potholes, that is even worse. 
Mr. Speaker, on this first day of this 
new Congress until the very last day of this new Congress, the American peo-ple are going to want to know whose side we are on. With these two votes we clearly demonstrate and clearly estab-lish who is on whose side. 
I urge my colleagues in this majority 
on this first day to establish for the American people whose backs they have: the special interests, tax deduc-tions for million-dollar bonuses, for-eign corporations; or rebuilding Amer-ica and rebuilding American jobs. 
Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, at this 
time, I yield 4 minutes to the gen-tleman from Virginia (Mr. G
OODLATTE ), 
the chairman of the Judiciary Com-mittee. 
Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in support of the rules package for the 114th Congress. 
I would like to begin by taking this 
opportunity to thank you, Chairman S
ESSIONS , the Speaker’s Office, and the 
other committee chairmen for working with me to hone and clarify the Judici-ary Committee’s criminal law jurisdic-tion. 
For many years, the House rules 
have given the Judiciary Committee jurisdiction over, among other things, the judiciary and judicial proceedings, civil and criminal, and criminal law enforcement. The Judiciary Commit-tee’s jurisdiction over criminal law dates back to the creation of the com-mittee in 1813. 
In recent years, however, we have be-
come aware of an anomaly in the refer-ral pattern that occasionally prevents the Judiciary Committee from obtain-ing a referral when a bill criminalizes

new conduct without actually address-
ing the penalty portion of the criminal law. In other words, while the Judici-ary Committee would have had juris-diction over the underlying statute when it was enacted, it is sometimes unable to assert jurisdiction when the statute is amended in such a way as to criminalize new conduct. The result is that new criminal offenses are being created without being considered by the lawmakers on the Judiciary Com-mittee, which is the committee best situated to provide valuable expertise in drafting and resolving potential con-flicts with existing criminal law. 
Last Congress, the Judiciary Com-
mittee created a bipartisan Over-Crim-inalization Task Force with the goal of examining the problems associated with a bloated, disorganized, and often redundant collection of Federal crimi-nal offenses. The Congressional Re-search Service recently reported to us that there are nearly 5,000 Federal criminal laws on the books. Unfortu-nately, Congress continues to add to this number at a rate of roughly 50 new crimes per year. 
One of the recurring themes from 
both the witnesses who appeared before the task force as well as the members of the task force is that it is crucial that the Judiciary Committee have the opportunity to review all new Federal criminal laws. 
Throughout its existence, this bipar-
tisan task force endeavored to closely examine the problems posed by over-criminalization and over-Federaliza-tion, and to identify potential solu-tions to combat the regrettable cir-cumstances that inevitably arise from the tangled web of Federal criminal provisions. Examples of similarly-situ-ated defendants convicted of the same conduct under different statutes with different penalties, or individuals con-victed of offenses without proof of any level of criminal intent, have been de-tailed in our hearings and are far too commonplace. 
The rules package today clarifies the 
committee’s jurisdiction over criminal matters by adding one word—‘‘crim-inalization’’—to our existing jurisdic-tion over criminal law. By making this change, the Judiciary Committee will have a new jurisdictional interest only in those relatively rare instances that a bill criminalizes new conduct by amending a statute that is attached to a criminal penalty without amending the penalty itself. In this instance, the Judiciary Committee will look to work with the other committee on ensuring that the new conduct is worthy of criminalization and that the attached criminal penalties are appropriately drafted. 
The Judiciary Committee is not 
looking to insert itself into the regu-latory schemes under the jurisdiction of other committees. However, to the extent that another committee chooses to use the criminal justice system to enforce the regulation under its juris-diction, we would like to be involved so that we may ask the important ques-
tion together as to whether particular conduct should be criminalized. 
In conclusion, I believe this small 
clarification of the Judiciary Commit-tee’s jurisdiction will allow us to ad-dress many of the problems associated with the tangled web of Federal crimi-nal laws. 
Again, I would like to thank Chair-
man S
ESSIONS and his staff for working 
very closely with us on this issue and express my strong support. 
I urge my colleagues to vote for this 
rules package. 
I rise today in support of the Rules package 
for the 114th Congress. 
I would like to begin by taking this oppor-
tunity to thank Chairman S
ESSIONS , the 
Speaker’s office, and the other Committee Chairmen for working with me to hone and clarify the Judiciary Committee’s criminal law jurisdiction. 
For many years, the House Rules have 
given the Judiciary Committee jurisdiction over, among other things, ‘‘the judiciary and judicial proceedings, civil and criminal,’’ and ‘‘criminal law enforcement.’’ The Judiciary Committee’s jurisdiction over criminal law dates back to the creation of the committee in 1813. 
Typically, the Judiciary Committee either re-
ceives a referral upon introduction or has the opportunity to seek a sequential referral when a bill creates a new criminal law or criminal penalties. This allows us to ensure that a criminal provision is properly drafted, or elimi-nated if it is unnecessary. 
In recent years, however, we have become 
aware of an anomaly in the referral pattern that occasionally prevents the Judiciary Com-mittee from obtaining a referral when a bill criminalizes new conduct without actually ad-dressing the penalty portion of the criminal law. In other words, while the Judiciary Com-mittee would have had jurisdiction over the un-derlying statute when it was enacted, it is sometimes unable to assert jurisdiction when the statute is amended in such a way as to criminalize new conduct. The result is that new criminal offenses are being created with-out being considered by the lawmakers on the Judiciary Committee, which is the Committee best situated to provide valuable expertise in drafting and resolving potential conflicts with existing criminal law. 
Last Congress, the Judiciary Committee cre-
ated a bipartisan Over-Criminalization Task Force with the goal of examining the problems associated with a bloated, disorganized and often redundant collection of federal criminal offenses. The Congressional Research Serv-ice recently reported to us that there are near-ly 5,000 federal criminal laws on the books. And, unfortunately, Congress continues to add to this number at a rate of roughly 50 new crimes per year. 
One of the recurring themes from both the 
witnesses who appeared before the task force, as well as the Members of the task force, is that it is crucial that the Judiciary Committee have the opportunity to review all new federal criminal laws. 
Our Members and staff have the long-
standing expertise to ensure that criminal laws are appropriately drafted, that they fit with the overall federal criminal law scheme, that they are appropriate in force relative to other crimi-nal laws, and finally, that the new criminal law 
is even necessary. 
Throughout its existence, this bi-partisan 
task force endeavored to closely examine the problems posed by over-criminalization and over-federalization, and to identify potential so-lutions to combat the regrettable cir-cumstances that inevitably arise from the tan-gled web of federal criminal provisions. Exam-ples of similarly-situated defendants convicted of the same conduct under different statutes with different penalties, or individuals con-victed of offenses without proof of any level of criminal intent, have been detailed in our hear-ings and are far too commonplace. 
The Rules package today clarifies the Com-
mittee’s jurisdiction over criminal matters by adding the word ‘‘criminalization’’ to our exist-ing jurisdiction over criminal law. By making this change, the Judiciary Committee will have a new jurisdictional interest only in those rel-
atively rare instances that a bill criminalizes new conduct by amending a statute that is at-tached to a criminal penalty without amending the penalty itself. In this instance, the Judiciary Committee will look to work with the other committee on ensuring that the new conduct is worthy of criminalization and that the attached criminal penalties are appropriately drafted. 
The Judiciary Committee is not looking to 
insert itself into the regulatory schemes under the jurisdiction of other committees. However, to the extent that another committee chooses to use the criminal justice system to enforce the regulation under its jurisdiction, we would like to be involved so that we may ask the im-portant question together as to whether par-ticular conduct should be criminalized. 
In conclusion, I believe this small clarifica-
tion to the Judiciary Committee’s jurisdiction will allow us to address many of the problems associated with the tangled web of federal criminal laws. 
Again, I would like to thank Chairman S
ES-
SIONS for working with me on this issue, and 
express my strong support for this Rules pack-age. 
Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-sume. 
The legacy of the 113th Congress 
shows us a broken institution: broken by partisanship and recalcitrance. 
I urge my colleagues to change 
course in the 114th Congress, to encour-age openness, transparency, and true bipartisanship. If we can achieve this, we will come together. 
If we defeat the previous question, I 
will move to amend the resolution to bring up the Stop Corporate Expatria-tion and Invest in America’s Infra-structure Act of 2015 to stop giving up American citizenship to avoid paying taxes. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent to insert the text of the amend-ment in the R
ECORD , along with extra-
neous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-woman from New York? 
There was no objection. Ms. SLAUGHTER. I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no,’’ and I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H23 January 6, 2015 
Overall, this package demonstrates 
Republicans’ commitment to an open process from Members on both sides of the aisle on the issues of the day that need to be debated, on legislation that will make a difference in the lives of the American people. 
We have heard from the Republican 
chairman of the Budget Committee and the Republican chairman of the Judici-ary Committee. I believe this is a great package. 
Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, this House 
rules package has a number of other provi-sions with which we have serious concerns. Most significantly, the rules change relating to Social Security. Late last night, the Republican rules package was revised to include a major new provision that will likely force Social Secu-rity benefit cuts. The new rule would prevent the House from considering legislation to pre-vent a scheduled 20 percent cut to Social Se-curity benefits for 11 million disabled workers and their families (by creating a point of order against legislation that reallocates FICA taxes between the Social Security Trust Funds, which have a current overall balance of $2.8 trillion), unless the legislation also includes So-cial Security benefit cuts or tax increases. Without any substantive debate and out of public view, the rule would prevent the House from even considering a mechanism endorsed by more than 50 advocacy groups and which Congress has used 11 times in the past to ad-dress shortfalls in one of the trust funds. 
H. Res. 5 also extends staff deposition au-
thority to four more committees (Energy and Commerce, Financial Services, Science, and Ways and Means). We are deeply concerned that these new authorities will be used to launch politically motivated attacks on the Af-fordable Care Act, Environmental Protection Agency actions, the implementation of Dodd- Frank financial industry reform, and IRS regu-lations. 
Democrats are disappointed that House Re-
publicans have decided to continue their politi-cally-motivated lawsuit against the President over implementation of the Affordable Care Act and their partisan investigations into ‘‘Fast and Furious’’ and the attack in Benghazi, Libya. Extensions of those authorities also ap-pear in H. Res. 5. 
H. Res. 5’s changes to the motion to in-
struct also concern us deeply. Under current rules, motions to instruct conferees can be of-fered 25 legislative days and 10 calendar days after conference committees have been ap-pointed. H. Res. 5 lengthens these periods, so that motions to instruct would be privileged 45 calendar days and 25 legislative days after the conference is appointed. This is clearly an at-tempt to weaken the Minority’s ability to par-ticipate in the conference committee process in the future. 
Changes to the authorizing language of the 
Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group have the po-tential to make it politically easier for the Ma-jority to file additional lawsuits against the President, and this possibility disturbs us given the events surrounding the filing of the ACA- related lawsuit last Congress. 
H. Res. 5 contains a number of other provi-
sions, some of which raise concerns and some of which appear to be innocuous. For example, small changes to the jurisdiction of certain committees, an increase in the size of the Intelligence Committee, an allowance for extra subcommittees on the Agriculture, 
Armed Services, Foreign Affairs, and Trans-portation and Infrastructure Committees, and allowing the Speaker to reconvene the House at a time other than previously appointed after consultation with the Minority Leader, among others. 
Mr. TOM PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, in 
this resolution, we are establishing a new re-quirement in clause 8 of Rule XIII that the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) incor-porate into the official cost estimates required under section 402 of the Congressional Budg-et Act of 1974 (Budget Act) the macro-economic effects of ‘‘major legislation.’’ Be-cause this rule builds on the existing require-ment for cost estimates, it does not apply to appropriations legislation. 
By including an analysis of how major legis-
lation will affect the economy, this rule pro-vides the House with a more comprehensive estimate than can be produced using only the traditional, conventional scoring methods which implicitly assume that legislation has no effect on the broader economy. In particular, this analysis is required to include the budg-etary effects of changes in economic output, employment, the capital stock, and other mac-roeconomic variables resulting from major leg-islation. In addition, this rule requires a quali-tative assessment of the long-term budgetary and macroeconomic effects of major legisla-tion. 
Major legislation is defined as legislation 
causing an increase or decrease in revenues, outlays, or deficits in any fiscal year covered by the budget resolution equal to or greater than 0.25 percent of the projected gross do-mestic product for that year. In applying the 0.25 percent threshold, CBO and JCT are re-quired to look at the gross budgetary effects of the legislation. In carrying out this require-ment, the intent is that CBO and JCT review provisions in the bill that have a significant ef-fect. Thus, the test is whether any provision in the legislation has a budgetary effect larger than the threshold, or if the absolute value of the sum of the provisions exceeds the thresh-old, rather than whether the legislation as a whole has such an effect when all of the provi-sions are netted out. 
Alternately, for legislation that may not have 
a large fiscal effect, but would still have signifi-cant economic impacts, the new rule empow-ers the House to designate ‘‘major legislation.’’ For all legislation other than purely revenue legislation, the rule authorizes the chair of the Budget Committee to designate ‘‘major legisla-tion.’’ For purely revenue legislation (i.e., legis-lation that contains only provisions described in section 201(f) of the Budget Act), the rule authorizes the House Member serving as the chair or vice chair of JCT, to designate ‘‘major legislation’’ for purposes of this rule. 
The rule carefully preserves the existing di-
vision of labor between CBO and JCT, which requires close collaboration between these two non-partisan institutions. When major leg-islation involves both revenue and non-rev-enue provisions, CBO and JCT will need to work together to produce a single, integrated cost estimate for the legislation drawing on each agency’s institutional responsibilities. 
The rule requires enhanced transparency 
around these budgetary estimates. Both CBO and JCT, as applicable, must provide together with their estimates a description of the critical assumptions and the source data underlying 
such estimates. It is important that CBO and JCT make this information available so that the public, academic, and other experts have an opportunity to review the analysis and pur-sue possible improvements in the methodolo-gies used to develop these estimates. Dis-tributional analyses of proposed tax changes that JCT provides as background information is another area where estimates could be im-proved by incorporating macroeconomic ef-fects into these analyses. 
The preparation of cost estimates incor-
porating macroeconomic effects is frequently more complex and requires more time than the preparation of conventional cost estimates. Committees should therefore build in addi-tional time to allow for the completion of the cost estimate. Both CBO and JCT should strive to promptly produce the estimates re-quired by this rule. To the extent it is not prac-
ticable for CBO and JCT to produce the re-quired estimates, the rule provides an accom-modation in this instance. Two possible cir-cumstances may arise when it is not feasible to produce the required analysis. First, com-mittees and the House may be operating under tight deadlines and it is not possible for CBO or JCT to complete the analysis prior to the legislation’s consideration. Second, while CBO and JCT have developed a great deal of expertise and experience in producing these analyses, there may be situations where it is not possible for CBO and JCT to produce the required analysis.

FFECTIVE DATE.—The amendments

THEVOTE ON THE PREVIOUS QUESTION : WHAT 
ITREALLY MEANS  
This vote, the vote on whether to order the 
previous question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. A vote against or-dering the previous question is a vote against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House should be debating. 
Mr. Clarence Cannon’s Precedents of the 
House of Representatives (VI, 308–311), de-scribes the vote on the previous question on the rule as ‘‘a motion to direct or control the consideration of the subject before the House being made by the Member in charge.’’ To defeat the previous question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the subject be-fore the House. Cannon cites the Speaker’s ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ‘‘the refusal of the House to sustain the de-mand for the previous question passes the 
control of the resolution to the opposition’’ in order to offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the majority party of-fered a rule resolution. The House defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said: ‘‘The previous question having been refused, the gentleman from New York, Mr. Fitz-gerald, who had asked the gentleman to yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first recognition.’’ 
The Republican majority may say ‘‘the 
vote on the previous question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no substantive legislative or policy im-plications whatsoever.’’ But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the Repub-lican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in the United States House of Rep-resentatives, (6th edition, page 135). Here’s how the Republicans describe the previous question vote in their own manual: ‘‘Al-though it is generally not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member con-trolling the time will not yield for the pur-pose of offering an amendment, the same re-sult may be achieved by voting down the pre-vious question on the rule ....  When the 
motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering the pre-vious question. That Member, because he then controls the time, may offer an amend-ment to the rule, or yield for the purpose of amendment.’’ 
In Deschler’s Procedure in the U.S. House 
of Representatives, the subchapter titled ‘‘Amending Special Rules’’ states: ‘‘a refusal to order the previous question on such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on Rules] opens the resolution to amend-ment and further debate.’’ (Chapter 21, sec-tion 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: ‘‘Upon re-jection of the motion for the previous ques-tion on a resolution reported from the Com-mittee on Rules, control shifts to the Mem-ber leading the opposition to the previous question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who controls the time for de-bate thereon.’’ 
Clearly, the vote on the previous question 
on a rule does have substantive policy impli-cations. It is one of the only available tools for those who oppose the Republican major-ity’s agenda and allows those with alter-native views the opportunity to offer an al-ternative plan.

HIRE MORE HEROES ACT OF 2015 
Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Madam 
Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 22) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to ex-empt employees with health coverage under TRICARE or the Veterans Ad-ministration from being taken into ac-count for purposes of determining the employers to which the employer man-date applies under the Patient Protec-tion and Affordable Care Act. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 22 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Hire More 
Heroes Act of 2015’’.

GENERAL LEAVE  
Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Madam 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within to which to revise and ex-tend their remarks and include extra-neous material on H.R. 22, currently under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Wisconsin? 
There was no objection. Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, only a law as bad as 
ObamaCare would penalize a small business for hiring a veteran. 
Madam Speaker, right now, the law 
says if you have at least 50 full-time employees, you must give all of them health insurance even if they are al-ready getting health insurance else-where. In fact, over 9 million veterans are already getting health care through the VA, but they are not ex-empt. Every employer has to cover them anyway. 
So here is what is happening. Busi-
nesses have an incentive to turn away veterans, not because they don’t want to hire them, but because it is too ex-pensive to hire them. This is serving as a penalty to hiring our Nation’s vet-erans. 
Madam Speaker, nobody works hard-
er than our men and women that serve us in our military. They fought for our country, and they sacrificed. The least we can do is remove this penalty from putting a veteran on your payroll. The way I see it is we owe it to them. We should make it as easy as possible for them to find a job. That is what we are trying to do with this legislation. 
What this bill says is that if you are 
already getting health care through TRICARE or the VA, then you are ex-empt from the mandate. Anyone can hire you without any fear of this pen-alty. I think we can all agree that more veterans on the payroll means a healthier economy for all of us. 
Now, I think all families need relief 
from ObamaCare. All of us need relief from this law that we think is going to collapse under its own weight, but I consider this bill as an installment plan, as one piece of our ongoing ef-forts to fully repeal and replace this law. 
Madam Speaker, we have an enor-
mous generation of talented men and women who have served this country so honorably overseas in the recent years. The least we can do is make it easier for an employer to hire them and re-move this penalty that puts a price tag on hiring the bravest among us. 
Most of all, I want to thank Con-
gressman R
ODNEY DAVIS for bringing 
this issue to our attention. I want to thank Congressman D
AVIS for intro-
ducing this legislation. 
With that, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. LEVIN. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I shall consume. 
First of all, I would like to congratu-
late Mr. R YAN on your selection in 
election, I guess, as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. We look forward to working together. 
Madam Speaker, I support this bill. 
This bill encourages the hiring of vet-erans. The unemployment rate has con-tinued to decline for post-9/11 veterans, 
and these improvements are part of a larger economic recovery. 
In November 2013, the unemployment 
rate for these veterans was nearly 10 percent. One year later, the rate has dropped to 5.7 percent, the national av-erage; yet for female post-9/11 veterans, the unemployment rate remains high, above 8 percent. 
This bill continues as part of our na-
tional commitment to help the vet-erans of this country. I want to empha-size this if I might: as we legislate, we need to balance priorities. We need to maintain—very differently than just spoken—the basic structure of ACA, which is providing millions and mil-lions of Americans with insurance and with coverage they never had. 
We also need to encourage the hiring 
of the veterans of this country who have served this Nation and serve this Nation so well. That is a supreme obli-gation of this institution; therefore, I support this legislation and reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Madam 
Speaker, at this time, I would like to yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Topeka, Kansas (Ms. J
ENKINS ), a 
member of the Ways and Means Com-mittee. 
Ms. JENKINS of Kansas. I thank the 
gentleman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I was a freshman 
lawmaker in 2010 when the President’s partisan health care law was passed through Congress and became law. I worried at the time that it would take our health care system in the wrong di-rection and would lead to numerous unintended consequences that could hurt American families. Now that the law is being implemented, we can see that this is indeed true. 
The employer mandate penalty tax is 
a troublesome and confusing piece of the President’s health care law. The American people want to see it fixed. The legislation that we are debating right now will exempt those who em-ploy members of our Nation’s military and veterans from the employer man-date. 
Because our current and former serv-
icemembers already receive health care from TRICARE and the VA, it simply does not make sense to force small businesses to treat these folks as if they do not have health insurance, which drives up the cost of doing busi-ness, leaving less for employees’ sala-ries. In fact, the current law effectively punishes small businesses for hiring these heroes. 
Madam Speaker, I was a proud co-
sponsor and supporter of this legisla-tion in the last Congress, and I am happy to again stand today in support of this commonsense provision. I ask that you support it. 
Mr. LEVIN. Madam Speaker, it is 
now my pleasure to yield as much time as she shall consume to the gentle-woman from Hawaii (Ms. G
ABBARD ),

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H30 January 6, 2015 
and now serves all of the people of Ha-
waii and I think, once again, all the people of this country. 
Ms. GABBARD. Madam Speaker, I 
am rising today in very strong support of this Hire More Heroes Act intro-duced by my friend, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. R
ODNEY DAVIS), 
someone whom I have been privileged to work with and am proud to cospon-sor this legislation. 
When he first came to me with this 
idea, it was a no-brainer that I would support it because of the key constitu-encies that this legislation serves: our veterans and our small businesses. In addition to that, I think, as we kick off this 114th Congress, it is a great mes-sage and exactly the right tone that we are focused on these two constitu-encies. 
By exempting veterans who have 
health insurance through the VA or from the DOD from being counted to-ward that 50-employee limit under the Affordable Care Act, this legislation creates important incentives. It en-courages small businesses to grow and expand their workforce, and it estab-lishes an incentive to hire more vet-erans. 
Madam Speaker, there are many peo-
ple who already receive insurance be-cause of their service to our country. I used to be one of them. I was covered under TRICARE for a long period of time after both of my deployments to the Middle East, and it just makes sense that these individuals who al-ready have great medical coverage would not have to count towards the numbers of employees that would trig-ger the employer mandate under the Affordable Care Act. 
Most importantly, this bill is about 
serving veterans. Servicemembers who are transitioning to civilian life bring exceptional training, critical skill sets, and proven leadership ability back to their local communities. 
b1745 
Unfortunately, as a country, we are 
facing an unacceptable number of un-employed veterans, people who are ex-perienced, who are capable and ener-getic, who are coming back from serv-ing oftentimes in conflicts overseas. These are veterans who will serve as a great asset to businesses and organiza-tions of any size because they come with a built-in unique work ethic, a great deal of training, and real-world experience. These are people who are highly disciplined, who know what it means to work as a member of a team. They know what it means to put the mission first, and they are servant leaders at their very best. 
This bill provides an incentive for 
businesses to hire these veterans and, in turn, helps these veterans be suc-cessful in their transition to civilian life. This commonsense legislation ben-efits both veterans and small busi-nesses, while also growing our econ-omy. I urge all of our colleagues to strongly support H.R. 22. Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-tlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. W
ALORSKI ). 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman and Representa-tive R
ODNEY DAVIS. 
Today I honor the 54,000 veterans in 
my district and 20 million veterans across America who deserve the oppor-tunity to have a job with the Hire More Heroes Act. The bill makes a change to ObamaCare and encourages small busi-nesses to hire more veterans by ex-empting veterans as long as they al-ready have health insurance. 
Currently, the employer mandate 
under ObamaCare requires that all businesses with more than 50 employ-ees provide health insurance to their employers or pay a penalty. But ac-cording to the Bureau of Labor Statis-tics, the unemployment rate for vet-erans last year was 6.6 percent, for those who served on Active Duty after 9/11 it was 9 percent. What saddens me about this is both of these percentages were higher than the national average of 6.3 percent. 
No veteran in the United States of 
America should be jobless because of ObamaCare’s employer mandate. Our brave men and women return from serving our Nation, return to civilian life while facing many challenges. Get-ting a job should not be one of them. This bill will ensure that employers can and will hire veterans and will not be penalized. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
bill. We must do everything in our power to ensure our finest men and women who come home have every op-portunity we promised them. 
Mr. LEVIN. I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gen-tleman from Illinois (Mr. R
ODNEY  
DAVIS), the author of this legislation. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I thank you for this opportunity today. Chairman R
YAN, 
my colleague from the great State of Michigan, I thank you for your support for this piece of legislation. 
Earlier today, a new Congress was 
sworn in, each of us swearing to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. A new Congress is an-other opportunity to do the people’s work, to further the ideas and prior-ities of our constituents and put our Nation on solid footing for an even brighter future. 
I am honored that this 114th Congress 
is opening with the Hire More Heroes Act, a bill that I have introduced and an idea that didn’t come from Wash-ington, D.C. It began with a con-stituent of mine, Brad Lavite, who is actually up in the gallery today. Brad had this idea, and as a superintendent of the Madison County Veterans’ As-sistance Commission, I am proud to have him here today to see the cul-mination of what that idea has turned into and the bipartisan support that you see for this idea on the floor of the 
House today. 
Brad helps the nearly 35,000 veterans 
living in Madison County navigate the VA system and actually find other re-sources, including helping our veterans find employment. After explaining ObamaCare to veterans throughout southwestern Illinois and how it im-pacts their VA health benefits, he began wondering why they were sub-ject to the employer mandate if they were not even in need of health care coverage. Brad raised his concern with me at one of our veterans advisory board meetings, and shortly thereafter we began work on the Hire More He-roes Act. 
This bill will help businesses hire 
more of our Nation’s veterans by mak-ing a commonsense change to ObamaCare. In just a few months, the President’s health care law will mark its fifth anniversary; 5 years of delays, canceled policies, costly Web site glitches, and increased out-of-pocket expenses for hardworking middle class families. Unfortunately, the law’s prob-lems don’t end there. We continue to see its lingering impact on our econ-omy as many small businesses delay hiring, cut hours, and, in some cases, reduce payroll. In fact, the National Small Business Association found that 91 percent of small businesses have seen increases in their health care costs, and two-thirds of their members listed ObamaCare as a reason for hold-ing off on investing in people. And, Madam Speaker, I must remind every-body that investing in people is how we create jobs here in America. 
The Hire More Heroes Act exempts 
veterans already enrolled in their own health care plans through the Depart-ment of Defense or through the VA from being counted toward the 50-em-ployee limit as part of the employer mandate required under ObamaCare. By making this commonsense change to the law, we will not only provide small businesses with much-needed re-lief, but also help more of our veterans find work. 
Despite receiving some of the best 
training in the world, post-9/11 vet-erans are consistently faced with high-er unemployment rates than that of other veterans. So as more and more of our veterans return home, the Hire More Heroes Act will give those who have sacrificed and served our country a leg up in a very competitive job mar-ket. Last Congress, this legislation passed this House overwhelmingly by a count of 406–1, almost as bipartisan as you can get, but it was held up in the Senate. 
The Hire More Heroes Act is just one 
example of the bipartisan bills that the House will bring up this Congress. Later this week, we will further the American people’s call for greater en-ergy independence and job creation by voting to approve the Keystone XL pipeline and by helping Americans by restoring the 40-hour workweek under ObamaCare.

if the President is willing to work with 
us, we have an opportunity to end the stagnation in Washington and make our government work for the people again. 
I ask all of my colleagues to defend 
the oath that they have just taken and help hire more of our heroes by voting ‘‘yes’’ on this piece of legislation. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to avoid references to occupants in the gallery. 
Mr. LEVIN. Madam Speaker, I ask 
the gentleman if he has other speakers. 
Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. We have 
four additional speakers. 
Mr. LEVIN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-tleman from Ohio (Mr. C
HABOT ), the 
chairman of the Small Business Com-mittee. 
Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, in the fall, we made 
a commitment to the American people, a commitment to produce solutions that grow our economy and create more opportunity and help our small businesses and make life better for working families. Today, the new American Congress begins the work of making good on that commitment, and we start with a bill that helps two groups critical to America’s success: our veterans and our small businesses. 
The Hire More Heroes Act is a bipar-
tisan bill which passed the House, as has been mentioned before, with more than 400 votes last year. It would make it easier for small businesses to hire veterans by exempting those veterans who already receive health care at the VA from ObamaCare’s costly employer mandate. This commonsense solution offsets the cost of hiring a veteran by addressing one of ObamaCare’s many failures, and there are many. 
As I have said many times before, I 
and many of my colleagues believe that ObamaCare should be repealed in its entirety. It may take awhile to do that, and so we can do some other things in the meantime. This is one of those things, a realistic thing which will actually help the American people. 
ObamaCare is placing tremendous 
burdens on small businesses looking to grow and individuals looking for work. This bill alleviates one of the many burdens ObamaCare places on our small businesses and, in doing so, helps our returning war fighters find mean-ingful work. 
Small businesses are responsible for 
the majority of new jobs created in America today. As the new incoming chairman of the House Small Business Committee, my goal each day will be to make life better for America’s small businesses so they can continue to in-novate and create jobs for more Ameri-cans who are seeking them. 
Even though unemployment has 
come down to some degree, we need to do a lot better. The bill before us today is an important step towards that goal and towards our commitment to the 
American people to create more jobs, real jobs in the private sector. I en-courage my colleagues to support the bill. 
Mr. LEVIN. I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-tlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. B
LACK ), a member of the Ways and 
Means Committee. 
Mrs. BLACK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of the Hire More Heroes Act. In my home State of Tennessee, we have over 525,000 vet-erans who have served our country in both war and peace—veterans, people like my son, Steve, and my husband, Dave. 
But today, too many of these Ameri-
cans are struggling to find work. In fact, the unemployment rate among post-September 11 veterans is chron-ically higher than the national unem-ployment rate. I believe that we can do better. After all, our veterans have sac-rificed for our country. Congress should, at the very least, make certain that Washington does not stand be-tween them and access to a steady job. 
The Hire More Heroes Act will help 
accomplish this by exempting veterans who already have health insurance from being counted as full-time work-ers under ObamaCare’s employer man-date, meaning that business owners can hire veterans without fear of being slapped with an ObamaCare penalty. That is why this body passed the legis-lation by an overwhelming vote of 406– 1 last year. Unfortunately, our efforts were stonewalled in the Democrat-con-trolled Senate. But today, we have an opportunity to start anew. 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ 
on the Hire More Heroes Act, and I thank the gentleman from Illinois for his work on this critical measure. 
Mr. LEVIN. I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
This basically is how it is supposed 
to work. A constituent in central Illi-nois, Brad Lavite, approaches his Con-gressman, Congressman D
AVIS, and 
says there is a problem with the law af-fecting our Nation’s veterans. So his Congressman goes to work, does the re-search, and then writes legislation to fix the law, and here we are. This is how it is supposed to work. This is how the Founders intended the Congress to work. 
Here is what we are fixing. We are 
saying there will not be a penalty based on the health care law affixed to our veterans. We have got a new, great generation. We have all read the books and heard the stories, and it is true, of the Greatest Generation, the World War II generation. We now have a new great generation, the men and women since 9/11 who have bravely fought for this country and sacrificed for us are a generation of people who have devel-oped the kinds of leadership skills, the 
kinds of courage, the experiences, the sacrifices their families made, and they are bringing that home to serve our country even further. They are bring-ing this great experience and talent and skills to our economy. We need to remove every conceivable barrier that exists that prevents them from sharing these talents with us. 
This bill takes us a big step in the 
right direction to removing this barrier that disincentivizes a small business from hiring a veteran and instead turns it into an incentive so we can hire our heroes, our veterans. 
With that, I reserve the balance of 
my time to close. 
Mr. LEVIN. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
As I said at the beginning, we need 
to, as we legislate, balance priorities. We have here a very different view of the ACA than has been expressed by several. But that isn’t the point of this legislation. This is about the veterans of this country. 
b1800 
This isn’t about Keystone. We will 
debate that some other time. We have very different views. This is no way a precedent to that. We will debate the 40-hour week later this week. We have some very different views, to put it mildly, about the legislation entitled the ‘‘40-hour week.’’ 
I should also like to point out regard-
ing ACA that businesses, small busi-nesses with fewer than 50 employees, aren’t even required to contribute to or offer insurance to their employees. 
This bill is called the Heroes Act be-
cause the focus of this bill is to make sure that there isn’t any disincentive for anybody to hire veterans. The rate of unemployment for veterans has been higher. I had the chance in Roseville, Michigan, to meet with veterans, Viet-nam veterans, some months ago. I was deeply troubled by the high rate of un-employment for those Vietnam vet-erans. This country has not done an adequate job in terms of making sure that veterans have a real opportunity to work. 
That is the tribute that we must pro-
vide, and it is more than a tribute; it is an obligation to those who have served this Nation. That is why this is called the Heroes Act. Let’s not distort it. Let’s not undermine what is the pur-pose of this legislation. Those who have served deserve as our priority any reasonable effort to provide them with the opportunity that they want. They have served. Now they want to work. We need to make sure they have that opportunity to work. 
It is within that spirit that I support 
this legislation and urge its passage. 
I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of the time only to say that our constitu-ents have been very clear to all of us on both sides of the aisle that they want to see us come together to find

Mrs. CAPPS changed her vote from 
‘‘nay’’ to ‘‘yea.’’ 
So (two-thirds being in the affirma-
tive) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. 
The result of the vote was announced 
as above recorded. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
PERSONAL EXPLANATION  
Mr. LARSON of Connecticut, Mr. Speaker, 
on January 6, 2015—I was not present for roll-call votes 6 and 7. If I had been present for these votes, I would have voted: ‘‘nay’’ on roll-call vote 6, ‘‘aye’’ on rollcall vote 7, the Hire 
More Heroes Act, as I had done previously in the 113th Congress when it passed the House (rollcall vote 115) on March 11, 2014.

f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair customarily takes this occasion at the outset of a Congress to announce 
her policies with respect to particular aspects of the legislative process. The Chair will insert in the R
ECORD an-
nouncements concerning: 
first, privileges of the floor; second, introduction of bills and reso-
lutions; 
third, unanimous-consent requests 
for the consideration of legislation; 
fourth, recognition for 1-minute 
speeches; 
fifth, recognition for Special Order 
speeches; 
sixth, decorum in debate; seventh, conduct of votes by elec-
tronic device; 
eighth, use of handouts on the House 
floor; 
ninth, use of electronic equipment on 
the House floor; and 
tenth, use of the Chamber. These announcements, where appro-
priate, will reiterate the origins of the stated policies. The Chair intends to continue in the 114th Congress the poli-cies reflected in these statements. The policy announced in the 102nd Congress with respect to jurisdictional concepts related to clause 5(a) of rule XXI—tax and tariff measures—will continue to govern but need not be reiterated, as it is adequately documented as precedent in the House Rules and Manual. 
Without objection, the announce-
ments will be printed in the R
ECORD . 
There was no objection. 
1. Privileges of the Floor 
The Chair will make the following an-
nouncements regarding floor privileges, which will apply during the 114th Congress. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER WITH RESPECT  
TO STAFF  
Rule IV strictly limits those persons to 
whom the privileges of the floor during ses-sions of the House are extended, and that rule prohibits the Chair from entertaining requests for suspension or waiver of that rule. As reiterated by the Chair on January 21, 1986, January 3, 1985, January 25, 1983, and August 22, 1974, and as stated in Chapter 10, section 2, of House Practice, the rule strictly limits the number of committee staff on the floor at one time during the consideration of measures reported from their committees. This permission does not extend to Members’ personal staff except when a Member’s amendment is actually pending during the five-minute rule. It also does not extend to personal staff of Members who are sponsors of pending bills or who are engaging in spe-cial orders. The Chair requests the coopera-tion of all Members and committee staff to assure that only the proper number of staff are on the floor, and then only during the consideration of measures within the juris-diction of their committees. The Chair is making this statement and reiterating this policy because of Members’ past insistence upon strict enforcement of the rule. The Chair requests each committee chair, and each ranking minority member, to submit to the Speaker a list of those staff who are al-lowed on the floor during the consideration of a measure reported by their committee. The Sergeant-at-Arms, who has been di-rected to assure proper enforcement of rule IV, will keep the list. Each staff person should exchange his or her ID for a ‘‘com-mittee staff’ badge, which is to be worn while on the floor. The Chair has consulted with the Minority Leader and will continue to consult with her. Furthermore, as the Chair announced on 
January 7, 2003, in accordance with the change in the 108th Congress of clause 2(a) of rule IV regarding leadership staff floor ac-cess, only designated staff approved by the Speaker shall be granted the privilege of the floor. The Speaker intends that his approval be narrowly granted on a bipartisan basis to staff from the majority and minority side and only to those staff essential to floor ac-tivities. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER WITH RESPECT  
TO FORMER MEMBERS  
The Speaker’s policy announced on Feb-
ruary 1, 2006, will continue to apply in the 114th Congress. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER , FEBRUARY 1 , 
2006 
The SPEAKER. The House has adopted a 
revision to the rule regarding the admission to the floor and the rooms leading thereto. Clause 4 of rule IV provides that a former Member, Delegate or Resident Commissioner or a former Parliamentarian of the House, or a former elected officer of the House or a former minority employee nominated as an elected officer of the House shall not be enti-tled to the privilege of admission to the Hall of the House and the rooms extending there-to if he or she is a registered lobbyist or an agent of a foreign principal; has any direct personal pecuniary interest in any legisla-tive measure pending before the House, or re-ported by a committee; or is in the employ of or represents any party or organization for the purpose of influencing, directly or indi-rectly, the passage, defeat, or amendment of any legislative proposal. 
This restriction extends not only to the 
House floor but adjacent rooms, the cloak-rooms and the Speaker’s lobby. 
Clause 4 of rule IV also allows the Speaker 
to exempt ceremonial and educational func-tions from the restrictions of this clause. These restrictions shall not apply to attend-ance at joint meetings or joint sessions, Former Members’ Day proceedings, edu-cational tours, and other occasions as the Speaker may designate. 
Members who have reason to know that a 
person is on the floor inconsistent with clause 4 of rule IV should notify the Ser-geant-at-Arms promptly. 
2. Introduction of Bills and Resolutions 
The policy that the Chair announced on 
January 3, 1983, with respect to the introduc-tion and reference of bills and resolutions will continue to apply in the 114th Congress. The Chair has advised all officers and em-ployees of the House who are involved in the processing of bills that every bill, resolution, memorial, petition or other material that is placed in the hopper must bear the signature of a Member. Where a bill or resolution is 
jointly sponsored, the signature must be that of the Member first named thereon. The bill clerk is instructed to return to the Mem-ber any bill which appears in the hopper without an original signature. This proce-dure was inaugurated in the 92d Congress. It has worked well, and the Chair thinks that it is essential to continue this practice to in-sure the integrity of the process by which legislation is introduced in the House. 
3. Unanimous-Consent Requests for the Consid-
eration of Legislation 
The policy the Chair announced on Janu-
ary 6, 1999, with respect to recognition for unanimous-consent requests for the consid-eration of certain legislative measures will continue to apply in the 114th Congress. The Speaker will continue to follow the guide-lines recorded in section 956 of the House Rules and Manual conferring recognition for unanimous-consent requests for the consid-eration of bills, resolutions, and other meas-ures only when assured that the majority

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H34 January 6, 2015 
and minority floor leadership and the rel-
evant committee chairs and ranking minor-ity members have no objection. Consistent with those guidelines and with the Chair’s inherent power of recognition under clause 2 of rule XVII, the Chair, and any occupant of the chair appointed as Speaker pro tempore pursuant to clause 8 of rule I, will decline recognition for the unanimous-consent re-quests chronicled in section 956 without as-surances that the request has been so cleared. This denial of recognition by the Chair will not reflect necessarily any per-sonal opposition on the part of the Chair to orderly consideration of the matter in ques-tion, but will reflect the determination upon the part of the Chair that orderly procedures will be followed; that is, procedures involv-ing consultation and agreement between floor and committee leadership on both sides of the aisle. 
4. Recognition for One-Minute Speeches 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER WITH RESPECT  
TO ONE -MINUTE SPEECHES  
The Speaker’s policy announced on August 
8, 1984, with respect to recognition for one- minute speeches will apply during the 114th Congress. The Chair will alternate recogni-tion for one-minute speeches between major-ity and minority Members, in the order in which they seek recognition in the well under present practice from the Chair’s right to the Chair’s left, with possible exceptions for Members of the leadership and Members having business requests. The Chair, of course, reserves the right to limit one- minute speeches to a certain period of time or to a special place in the program on any given day, with notice to the leadership. 
5. Recognition for Special-Order Speeches 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER WITH RESPECT  
TO SPECIAL -ORDER SPEECHES  
The Speaker’s policy with regard to spe-
cial-order speeches announced on February 11, 1994, as clarified and reiterated by subse-quent Speakers, will continue to apply in the 114th Congress, with the following modifica-tions. 
The Chair may recognize Members for spe-
cial-order speeches for up to 4 hours. Such speeches may not extend beyond the 4–hour limit without the permission of the Chair, 
which may be granted only with advance consultation between the leaderships and no-tification to the House. However, the Chair will not recognize for any special-order speeches beyond 10 o’clock in the evening. 
The 4-hour limitation will be divided be-
tween the majority and minority parties. Each party is entitled to reserve its first hour for respective leaderships or their des-ignees. The second hour reserved to each party will be divided into two 30–minute pe-riods. Recognition for one-hour periods and for 30–minute periods will alternate initially and subsequently between the parties each day. The Chair wishes to clarify for Members that any 60- or 30–minute period that is not claimed at the appropriate time will be con-sidered to have expired; this includes the first 60–minute period of the day. 
The allocation of time within each party’s 
2–hour period (or shorter period if prorated to end by 10 p.m.) will be determined by a list submitted to the Chair by the respective leaderships. Members may not sign up with their leadership for any special-order speech-es earlier than one week prior to the special order. Additional guidelines may be estab-lished for such sign-ups by the respective leaderships. 
Pursuant to clause 2(a) of rule V, the tele-
vision cameras will not pan the Chamber, but a ‘‘crawl’’ indicating the conduct of morning-hour debate or that the House has 
completed its legislative business and is pro-ceeding with special-order speeches will ap-pear on the screen. The Chair may announce other adaptations during this period. 
The continuation of this format for rec-
ognition by the Speaker is without prejudice to the Speaker’s ultimate power of recogni-tion under clause 2 of rule XVII and includes the ability to withdraw recognition for longer special-order speeches should cir-cumstances warrant. 
6. Decorum in Debate 
The Chair’s announced policies of January 
7, 2003, January 4, 1995, and January 3, 1991, will apply in the 114th Congress. It is essen-tial that the dignity of the proceedings of the House be preserved, not only to assure that the House conducts its business in an orderly fashion but also to permit Members to properly comprehend and participate in the business of the House. To this end, and in order to permit the Chair to understand and to correctly put the question on the numer-ous requests that are made by Members, the Chair requests that Members and others who have the privileges of the floor desist from audible conversation in the Chamber while the business of the House is being conducted. The Chair would encourage all Members to review rule XVII to gain a better under-standing of the proper rules of decorum ex-pected of them, and especially: to avoid ‘‘personalities’’ in debate with respect to ref-erences to other Members, the Senate, and the President; to address the Chair while standing and only during, and not beyond, the time recognized, and not to address the television or other imagined audience; to re-frain from passing between the Chair and a Member speaking, or directly in front of a Member speaking from the well; to refrain from smoking in the Chamber; to wear ap-propriate business attire in the Chamber; and to generally display the same degree of respect to the Chair and other Members that every Member is due. 
The Chair would like all Members to be on 
notice that the Chair intends to strictly en-force time limitations on debate. Further-more, the Chair has the authority to imme-diately interrupt Members in debate who transgress rule XVII by failing to avoid ‘‘per-sonalities’’ in debate with respect to ref-erences to the Senate, the President, and other Members, rather than wait for Mem-bers to complete their remarks. 
Finally, it is not in order to speak dis-
respectfully of the Speaker; and under the precedents the sanctions for such violations transcend the ordinary requirements for timeliness of challenges. This separate treat-ment is recorded in volume 2 of Hinds’ Prece-dents, at section 1248 and was reiterated on January 19, 1995. 
7. Conduct of Votes by Electronic Device 
The Speaker’s policy announced on Janu-
ary 4, 1995, with respect to the conduct of electronic votes will continue in the 114th Congress with modifications as follows. 
As Members are aware, clause 2(a) of rule 
XX provides that Members shall have not less than 15 minutes in which to answer an ordinary record vote or quorum call. The rule obviously establishes 15 minutes as a minimum. Still, with the cooperation of the Members, a vote can easily be completed in that time. The events of October 30, 1991, stand out as proof of this point. On that oc-casion, the House was considering a bill in the Committee of the Whole under a special rule that placed an overall time limit on the amendment process, including the time con-sumed by record votes. The Chair announced, and then strictly enforced, a policy of clos-
ing electronic votes as soon as possible after the guaranteed period of 15 minutes. Mem-bers appreciated and cooperated with the Chair’s enforcement of the policy on that oc-casion. 
The Chair desires that the example of Oc-
tober 30, 1991, be made the regular practice of the House. To that end, the Chair enlists the assistance of all Members in avoiding the un-necessary loss of time in conducting the business of the House. The Chair encourages all Members to depart for the Chamber promptly upon the appropriate bell and light signal. As in recent Congresses, the cloak-rooms should not forward to the Chair re-quests to hold a vote by electronic device, but should simply apprise inquiring Members of the time remaining on the voting clock. Members should not rely on signals relayed from outside the Chamber to assume that votes will be held open until they arrive in the Chamber. Members will be given a rea-sonable amount of time in which to accu-rately record their votes, and the Chair will endeavor to assess the presence of the mem-bership and the expectation of further votes prior to exercising his authority under clause 8(c)(2) of rule XX or clause 6(g)(2) of rule XVIII. No occupant of the Chair would prevent a Member who is in the well before the announcement of the result from casting his or her vote. The Speaker believes the best practice for presiding officers is to await the Clerk’s certification that a vote tally is complete and accurate. 
8. Use of Handouts on House Floor 
The Speaker’s policy announced on Sep-
tember 27, 1995, which was prompted by a misuse of handouts on the House floor and made at the bipartisan request of the Com-mittee on Standards of Official Conduct, will continue in the 114th Congress. All handouts distributed on or adjacent to the House floor by Members during House proceedings must bear the name of the Member authorizing their distribution. In addition, the content of those materials must comport with stand-ards of propriety applicable to words spoken in debate or inserted in the Record. Failure to comply with this admonition may con-stitute a breach of decorum and may give rise to a question of privilege. 
The Chair would also remind Members 
that, pursuant to clause 5 of rule IV, staff is prohibited from engaging in efforts in the Hall of the House or rooms leading thereto 
to influence Members with regard to the leg-islation being amended. Staff cannot dis-tribute handouts. 
In order to enhance the quality of debate 
in the House, the Chair would ask Members to minimize the use of handouts. 
9. Use of Electronic Equipment on House Floor 
The Speaker’s policy announced on Janu-
ary 27, 2000, as clarified on January 6, 2009, and as modified by the change in clause 5 of rule XVII in the 112th Congress, will con-tinue in the 114th Congress. All Members and staff are reminded of the absolute prohibi-tion contained in clause 5 of rule XVII against the use of mobile electronic devices that impair decorum. Those devices include wireless telephones and personal computers. The Chair wishes to note that electronic tab-let devices do not constitute personal com-puters within the meaning of this policy and thus may be unobtrusively used in the Chamber. No device may be used for still photography or for audio or video recording. 
The Chair requests all Members and staff 
wishing to receive or make wireless tele-phone calls to do so outside of the Chamber. The Chair further requests that all Members and staff refrain from wearing telephone

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H35 January 6, 2015 
headsets in the Chamber and to deactivate 
any audible ring of wireless phones before entering the Chamber. To this end, the Chair insists upon the cooperation of all Members and staff and instructs the Sergeant-at- Arms, pursuant to clause 3(a) of rule II and clause 5 of rule XVII, to enforce this prohibi-tion. 
10. Use of Chamber 
The Speaker’s policy announced on Janu-
ary 6, 2009, with respect to use of the Cham-ber will continue in the 114th Congress. 
The Chair will announce to the House the 
policy of the Speaker concerning appropriate comportment in the chamber when the House is not in session. 
Under clause 3 of rule I, the Speaker is re-
sponsible to control the Hall of the House. Under clause 1 of rule IV, the Hall of the House is to be used only for the legislative business of the House, for caucus and con-ference meetings of its Members, and for such ceremonies as the House might agree to conduct there. 
When the House stands adjourned, its 
chamber remains on static display It may accommodate visitors in the gallery or on the floor, subject to the needs of those who operate, maintain, and secure the chamber to go about their ordinary business. Because outside ‘‘coverage’’ of the chamber is limited to floor proceedings and is allowed only by accredited journalists, when the chamber is on static display no audio or video recording or transmitting devices are allowed. The long custom of disallowing even still photog-raphy in the chamber is based at least in part on the notion that an image having this setting as its backdrop might be taken to carry the imprimatur of the House. 
The imprimatur of the House adheres to 
the Journal of its proceedings, which is kept pursuant to the Constitution. The impri-matur of the House adheres to the Congres-sional Record, which is kept as a substan-tially verbatim transcript pursuant to clause 8 of rule XVII. The imprimatur of the House adheres to the audio and visual trans-missions and recordings that are made and kept by the television system administered by the Speaker pursuant to rule V. But the imprimatur of the House may not be appro-priated to other, ad hoc accounts or composi-tions of events in its chamber.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H47 January 6, 2015 
Sebelius, the Supreme Court ruled that the 
financial penalty for failing to purchase health insurance as mandated by the Afford-able Care Act is a tax that Congress may im-pose through the taxing power. Even if the penalty imposed by the Affordable Care Act must be construed to be a tax, it does not satisfy the three types of taxes—income, ex-cise, or direct—that are listed as valid in the Constitution. The penalty is not assessed on income so it is not a valid income tax. The penalty is not assessed uniformly and is trig-gered by economic inactivity so it is not a valid excise tax. Finally, the penalty is not apportioned among the states by population and therefore is not a valid direct tax. The tax imposed by the Affordable Care Act, by every measure, extends beyond the taxing power granted to Congress by the Constitu-tion and it is only necessary and proper that Congress repeal the individual mandate.

Let us pray. Almighty God, Lord of our lives and 
sovereign of our beloved Nation, as we begin this 114th Congress, guide our lawmakers, old and new, on the right road. We confess our need for Your su-pernatural power to provide them with insight, innovation, and inspiration to solve the problems we face. 
Lord, give to our Senators uncom-
mon guidance as they seek to do what is best for this land we love. Enable them to develop a slow exploratory wisdom, neither of the heart only nor of the head only, so that they will act with an integrity that will bring them to Your desired destination. May they not run from disquieting consider-ations but instead claim Your promise that the truth shall set us free. 
We pray in Your omnipotent Name. 
Amen.

WELCOMING MEMBERS OF THE 
SENATE AND WISHING SENATOR REID A SPEEDY RECOVERY 
Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, 
today is an important day for our country. Many Senators took the oath this afternoon—13 for the first time— and the new Republican majority ac-cepted its new responsibility. We rec-ognize the enormity of the task before us. We know a lot of hard work awaits. We know many important opportuni-ties await as well. 
I am really optimistic about what we 
can accomplish. I will have much more to say about that tomorrow. For now, I just want to welcome back all of our returning Members. I want to con-gratulate the many new ones, and I want to say a word about our colleague from Nevada. 
Senator R
EIDis a former boxer. He is 
tough. I know he will be back in fight-ing form soon enough. We all wish him a speedy recovery and I wish him the very best. 
To all of you, enjoy the ceremonies 
today. Tomorrow is back to work. 
I yield the floor. The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
acting minority leader. 
f 
THE NEW CONGRESS 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank 
the majority leader for those kind words. I am happy to report the Demo-cratic leader of the Senate, Senator R
EID, is making a speedy recovery from 
his New Year’s run-in with some exer-cise equipment. His face and ribs are still sore. He is eager to get back to work. We met with him this morning, and we can expect him back in the Sen-ate very soon. 
In the meantime, it is a privilege on 
behalf of the Democratic Caucus to welcome our old colleagues back to 
work and welcome our new colleagues and their families to the U.S. Senate. I also want to wish Leader M
CCONNELL , 
as he takes up the new duties of the majority leader, the very best. Senator Dirksen was a Senator from my home State of Illinois who served as a Repub-lican leader of the Senate from 1959 to 1969. He famously said, ‘‘I am a man of fixed and unbending principles, the first of which is to be flexible at all times.’’ 
That may sound comical, even con-
tradictory. But Senator Dirksen’s abil-ity on flexible tactics and firmness on principles helped produce historic leg-islation such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964, one of the greatest achievements in our Nation’s history. I am sure we all will remember that with fondness and pride. 
The American people need us to work 
together to solve problems and create opportunities. For their sake, let us all try to remember that what we are about is honorable compromise. The Constitution of the United States and the Senate itself are the results of just such a compromise. 
One other point. One hundred years 
ago this week, an American industri-alist and entrepreneur stunned the world by announcing he would start paying his workers double the industry average and cut the hours. That man, of course, was Henry Ford. He com-mitted to pay his workers a minimum wage. 
As we begin this new Congress, let us 
dedicate ourselves to the working men and women across America, the tax-payers of this country, and the men and women which we so proudly serve. I hope that we will show flexibility and principle. We can’t solve America’s challenges with the same old thinking. We have to address the problems with mutual respect and with a positive at-titude. 
I look forward to, on this side of the 
aisle, working with Senator R
EIDand 
my colleagues to achieve that end. 
Congratulations to Leader M CCON-
NELL . 
f 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST— 
ENERGY AND NATURAL RE-SOURCES COMMITTEE 
Mr. M
CCONNELL. I thank my friend 
the acting minority leader. We are anx-ious to get to work here. In that re-gard, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order for the Energy and Natural Resources Committee to meet on Janu-ary 7, tomorrow, for the purpose of hearing testimony on the Keystone Pipeline; that the meeting be chaired by Senator M
URKOWSKI , with Senator 
CANTWELL as ranking member; that the 
following Senators not currently serv-ing on the committee be considered Members of the committee for the pur-pose of this meeting: Senators D
AINES , 
CASSIDY , G ARDNER , C APITO , H IRONO , 
KING, and W ARREN ; I further ask that 
the meeting be considered to comport with all Senate rules relating to the 
conduct of committees and that cus-tomary and authorized expenses be per-mitted. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is 
there objection? 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, reserv-
ing the right to object. Under the tra-ditions and rules of the Senate, all of the Senate committees are organized in a resolution, which we anticipate will be offered tomorrow for the orga-nization of the committee structure of the U.S. Senate. 
I say to the majority leader, we will 
continue this conversation in a posi-tive manner in an effort to come up with a mutually agreeable approach to consider this legislation and others, but for that reason I must object. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Mr. M
CCONNELL. If I may, let me 
just say again, nobody’s rights would have been in any way impaired by going forward a day earlier. We are going to pass the committee resolution tomorrow. We all know that one of the things the Senate is best at is not doing much. I hope we can work this out so we can get started. Everyone knows the first measure that is going to be up is going to come out of the en-ergy committee. I would say to my friends on the minority side, it is open for amendment. Why don’t we get started? Hopefully Senator M
URKOWSKI  
and Senator C ANTWELL can work 
through this and we can get going and do the people’s business. We are anx-ious to get started.

MORNING BUSINESS 
REMEMBERING SYLVIA GARCIA 
RICKARD 
Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, it is with 
a heavy heart that I rise to convey to my colleagues news of the tragic death of Sylvia Rickard—one of the Nation’s top breast cancer advocates—a woman so full of life and joy, so deeply im-mersed in the science of her passion, that it is impossible to imagine this sad, sad occurrence. 
Sylvia was truly an amazing person 
who touched many lives. I first met Sylvia when she visited my office so many years ago to educate me on the need for more breast cancer research, for better breast cancer screening, and for better patient navigation. Sylvia, herself a two-time survivor of breast cancer, and later of ocular melanoma, made sure that my staff and I, and in-deed all of the Utah and Idaho delega-tions, regardless of party, were kept apprised of the latest developments in breast cancer research. She patiently walked us through the science behind the research—a science she made it her business to know in great detail. 
Sylvia was such a good advocate be-
cause she had fought this dread dis-ease, and won. Not once, but twice.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S10 January 6, 2015 
Moreover, Sylvia, and her husband 
Rick, became friends to all—to me, my staff, and to my former staff—here in Washington, and in our beloved State of Utah. She always had a smile and a hug for everyone. 
Sylvia made it her business not just 
to talk the talk, but also to walk the walk. She was a past president of the Women’s State Legislative Council in Utah, a bipartisan group of women who meet to discuss issues of importance to Utah and the Nation. She also was the founder of the Utah Breast Cancer Net-work, and the president of the Hispanic Health Care Task Force in Utah. Syl-via became involved in building aware-ness at the local level, as well as the national level. Indeed, she was very proud to have been selected to be an advisor to the National Institutes of Health—a remarkable recognition of her top-ranked talent. She was in-volved at all levels in advocating for better biomedical research, better sup-port for that research, and for a non-partisan, commonsense approach to a disease that is now expected to affect one in eight women over their life-times. 
I recall the twinkle in Sylvia’s eye 
when top experts at the Huntsman Cancer Center in Salt Lake City sought her knowledge about eye cancer, after she was treated successfully. She had found a surgeon in another State who could treat her without the certain loss of her eye, and she helped to connect the physicians so they could learn from each other. 
It was a great loss to Utah when Rick 
Rickard built Sylvia the house of their dreams for retirement in Boise, ID this past fall. But we were all happy they had achieved their dream. I heard she was absolutely delighted to cook in her new kitchen. I am so pleased she at least got to spend a few months in their new home, one they had worked for so hard over so many years finally to achieve. 
So our hearts go out to the Rickard 
and Garcia families, to Sylvia and Rick’s two sons, Richard, Jr. and David, and to the many millions of oth-ers whose lives have been made better by the significant achievements of my friend, Sylvia Rickard.

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. 
MARKEY , Mr. C OONS , Mr. W HITE-
HOUSE , Mr. F RANKEN , and Mrs. 
BOXER ): 
S. 23. A bill to amend title 17, United 
States Code, with respect to the defini-tion of ‘‘widow’’ and ‘‘widower’’, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary. 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, over the 
past few years we have seen remark-able progress in one of the defining civil rights issues of our era—ensuring that all lawfully married couples are treated equally under the law. In 2011, when I chaired the first Congressional hearing to repeal the Defense of Mar-riage Act, only 5 States, including Vermont, recognized same-sex mar-riage. With today’s lifting of Florida’s unconstitutional same-sex marriage 
ban, couples in 36 States and the Dis-trict of Columbia now have the free-dom to marry. This is welcome progress, and I hope we will see similar advancements in even more States this year so that all Americans can marry the one they love. 
Despite this tremendous progress, 
there is still more to be done to ensure that no person faces discrimination based on who they marry or wish to marry. As I said when the Supreme Court struck down Section 3 of the De-fense of Marriage Act, ‘‘All couples who are lawfully married under state law, including in Vermont, should be entitled to the same Federal protec-tions afforded to all other married cou-ples.’’ Court challenges will continue this year in the remaining States that do not recognize marriage equality. But in Congress, there are several steps we can take immediately to help en-sure our Federal laws treat all mar-riages equally. 
Surprisingly, the Copyright Act, 
which protects our Nation’s diverse creative voices, still bears vestiges of discrimination. A provision in the Act grants rights to the surviving spouse of a copyright owner only if the marriage is recognized in the owner’s State of residence at the time he or she dies. This means that a writer who lawfully marries his or her partner in Vermont or California is not a ‘‘spouse’’ under the Copyright Act if they move to Michigan, Georgia, or one of the other States that do not currently recognize their marriage. 
Congress should close this discrimi-
natory loophole to ensure our Federal statutes live up to our Nation’s prom-ise of equality under the law. As the Supreme Court recognized in striking down key portions of the Defense of Marriage Act, it is wrong for the Fed-eral Government to deny benefits or privileges to couples who have lawfully wed. 
Today I am reintroducing the Copy-
right and Marriage Equality Act in the Senate to correct this problem. The bill, which I introduced in the Senate last Congress and which a bipartisan group of lawmakers including Rep-resentatives D
EREK KILMER , ILEANA  
ROS-LEHTINEN , and J ARED POLIS plans 
to reintroduce in the House of Rep-resentatives soon, amends the Copy-right Act to look simply at whether a couple is lawfully married—not where a married couple happens to live when the copyright owner dies. It will ensure that the rights attached to the works of our Nation’s gay and lesbian au-thors, musicians, painters, photog-raphers, and other creators pass to their widows and widowers. Artists are part of the creative lifeblood of our Na-tion, and our laws should protect their families equally. 
When I introduced this bill last year, 
it failed to get the support of a single Republican in the Senate. I hope that in this Congress, Republicans will con-sider joining this effort to correct

these remnants of discrimination in 
our Federal laws. On the issue of mar-riage equality, the arc of history is at long last bending towards justice, so that all Americans one day will be free to marry the one they love. Statutes like the Copyright Act, or laws gov-erning the Social Security Administra-tion and Department of Veterans Af-fairs which also contain remnants of discrimination, are no place for in-equality in our country. I urge the Sen-ate to take up and pass this important piece of legislation. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-

Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-

ECORD , as follows: 
S. 23 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of 
Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Copyright 
and Marriage Equality Act’’. 
SEC. 2. DEFINITION OF WIDOW AND WIDOWER IN 
TITLE 17, UNITED STATES CODE. 
(a) I NGENERAL .—Section 101 of title 17, 
United States Code, is amended by striking the definition of ‘‘‘widow’ or ‘widower’’’ and inserting the following: 
‘‘An individual is the ‘widow’ or ‘widower’ 
of an author if the courts of the State in which the individual and the author were married (or, if the individual and the author were not married in any State but were val-idly married in another jurisdiction, the courts of any State) would find that the indi-vidual and the author were validly married at the time of the author’s death, whether or not the spouse has later remarried.’’. 
(b) E
FFECTIVE DATE.—The amendment 
made by subsection (a) shall apply with re-spect to the death of any author that occurs on or after the date of the enactment of this Act. 
By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself 
and Mr. L EE): 
S. 24. A bill to clarify that an author-
ization to use military force, a declara-tion of war, or any similar authority shall not authorize the detention with-out charge or trial of a citizen or law-ful permanent resident of the United States; to the Committee on the Judi-ciary. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, 
today I rise to introduce the Due Proc-ess Guarantee Act, which passed the Senate in 2012 with 67 votes as an amendment to the Defense Authoriza-tion Act for fiscal year 2013. 
Unfortunately, the amendment was 
taken out in the Conference Com-mittee that year. It is my hope that the Senate will pass this legislation again this year, and this time the House will support it so that it can fi-nally be enacted into law to protect Americans from being detained indefi-nitely. 
The bipartisan bill I am introducing 
today, with Senator L
EEas the lead co- 
sponsor, is almost identical to the amendment that passed the Senate in December 2012 with 67 votes. The pre-vious version of this bill had a hearing in the Judiciary Committee on Feb-
ruary 29, 2012. 
This legislation is necessary to pre-
vent the U.S. Government from detain-ing its citizens indefinitely. 
Unfortunately, indefinite detention 
has been a part of America’s not-too- distant past. The internment of Japa-nese-Americans during World War II remains a dark spot on our Nation’s legacy, and is something we should never repeat. 
To ensure that this reprehensible ex-
perience would never happen again, Congress passed and President Nixon signed into law the Non-Detention Act of 1971, which repealed a 1950 statue that explicitly allowed the indefinite detention of U.S. citizens. 
The Non-Detention Act of 1971 clear-
ly states: 
No citizen shall be imprisoned or otherwise 
detained the United States except pursuant to an act of Congress. 
Despite the shameful history of in-
definite detention of Americans and the legal controversy over the issue since 9/11, during debate on the defense authorization bill in past years, some in the Senate have advocated for allow-ing the indefinite detention of U.S. citizens. 
Proponents of indefinitely detaining 
U.S. citizens argue that the Authoriza-tion for Use of Military Force, AUMF, that was enacted shortly after 9/11 is, quote, ‘‘an act of Congress,’’ in the lan-guage of the Non-Detention Act of 1971, that authorizes the indefinite deten-tion of American citizens regardless of where they are captured. 
They further assert that their posi-
tion is justified by the U.S. Supreme Court’s plurality decision in the 2004 case of Hamdi v. Rumsfeld. However, the Hamdi case involved an American captured on the battlefield in Afghani-stan. 
Yaser Esam Hamdi was a U.S. citizen 
who took up arms on behalf of the Taliban and was captured on the bat-tlefield in Afghanistan. The divided Court did effectively uphold his mili-tary detention, so some of my col-leagues use this case to argue that the military can indefinitely detain even American citizens who are arrested do-mestically here on U.S. soil, far from the battlefield of Afghanistan. 
However, the Supreme Court’s opin-
ion in the Hamdi case was a muddled decision by a four-vote plurality that recognized the power of the govern-ment to detain U.S. citizens captured in such circumstances as ‘‘enemy com-batants’’ for some period, but other-wise repudiated the government’s broad assertions of executive authority to detain citizens without charge or trial. 
In particular, the Court limited its 
holding to citizens captured in an area of, quote, ‘‘active combat operations’’, unquote, and concluded that even in those circumstances the U.S. Constitu-tion and the Due Process Clause guar-antees U.S. citizens certain rights, in-cluding the ability to challenge their enemy combatant status before an im-partial judge. The plurality’s opinion stated: 
It [the Government] has made clear, how-
ever, that, for purposes of this case, the ‘enemy combatant’ that it is seeking to de-tain is an individual who, it alleges, was ‘part of or supporting forces hostile to the United States or coalition partners’ in Af-ghanistan and who ‘‘‘engaged in an armed conflict against the United States’’ there. Brief for Respondents 3. We therefore answer only the narrow question before us: whether the detention of citizens falling within that definition is authorized.’’ 
The opinion goes on to say at page 
517 that ‘‘we conclude that the AUMF is explicit congressional authorization for the detention of individuals in the narrow category we describe . . .’’ 
Indeed, the plurality later empha-
sized that it was discussing a citizen captured on a foreign battlefield. Criti-cizing Justice Scalia’s dissenting opin-ion, the opinion says, ‘‘Justice Scalia largely ignores the context of this case: a United States citizen captured in a foreign combat zone.’’ The plurality italicized and emphasized the word ‘‘foreign’’ in that sentence. 
Thus, to the extent the Hamdi case 
permits the government to detain a U.S. citizen ‘‘until the end of hos-tilities,’’ it does so only under a very limited set of circumstances, namely citizens taking an active part in hos-tilities, who are captured in Afghani-stan, and who are afforded certain due 
process protections, at a minimum. 
Additionally, decisions by the lower 
courts have contributed to the current state of legal ambiguity when it comes to the indefinite detention of U.S. citi-zens, such as Jose Padilla, a U.S. cit-izen who was arrested in Chicago in 2002. He was initially detained pursu-ant to a material witness warrant based on the 9/11 terrorist attacks and later designated as an ‘‘enemy combat-ant’’ who conspired with al-Qaeda to carry out terrorist attacks including a plot to detonate a ‘‘dirty bomb’’ inside the U.S. 
Padilla was transferred to the mili-
tary brig in South Carolina where he was detained for three and a half years while seeking habeas corpus relief. Padilla was never charged with at-tempting to carry out the ‘‘dirty bomb’’ plot. Instead, Padilla was re-leased from military custody in No-vember 2005 and transferred to Federal civilian custody in Florida where he was indicted on other charges in Fed-eral court related to terrorist plots overseas. 
While he was indefinitely detailed by 
the military, Padilla filed a habeas cor-pus petition which was litigated at first in the Second Circuit Court of Ap-peals, and then in the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. In a 2003 decision by the Second Circuit known as Padilla v. Rumsfeld, the Court of Appeals held that the AUMF did not authorize his detention, saying: ‘‘we conclude that clear congressional authorization is re-quired for detentions of American citi-zens on American soil because 18 U.S.C.

§4001(a) the ‘‘Non-Detention Act’’, pro-
hibits such detentions absent specific congressional authorization. Congress’s Authorization for Use of Military Force Joint Resolution, . . . passed shortly after the attacks of September 11, 2001, is not such an authorization.’’ 
This requirement for ‘‘clear congres-
sional authorization’’ to detain is known as the Second Circuit’s ‘‘Clear Statement Rule.’’ 
However, the Fourth Circuit Court of 
Appeals reached the opposite conclu-sion, finding that the AUMF did au-thorize his detention. It is worth point-ing out, however, that their analysis turned entirely on the disputed claims that ‘‘Padilla associated with forces hostile to the United States in Afghan-istan,’’ and, ‘‘like Hamdi, Padilla took up arms against United States forces in that country in the same way and to the same extent as did Hamdi.’’ 
Facing an impending Supreme Court 
challenge and mounting public criti-cism for holding a U.S. citizen arrested inside the U.S. as an enemy combatant, the Bush administration relented, and ordered Padilla transferred to civilian custody to face criminal conspiracy and material support for terrorism charges in Federal court. 
I believe that the time is now to end 
the legal ambiguities, and have Con-gress state clearly, once and for all, that the AUMF or other authorities do not authorize indefinite detention of Americans apprehended in the U.S. 
To accomplish this, we are intro-
ducing legislation again this year which affirms and strengthens the principles behind the Non-Detention Act of 1971. 
It amends the Non-Detention Act to 
provide clearly that no military au-thorization allows the indefinite deten-tion of U.S. citizens or Green Card holders who are apprehended inside the U.S. 
Like the amendment that passed 
with 67 votes in 2012, the bill creates a new subsection (b) of the Non-Deten-tion Act which clearly states: ‘‘A gen-eral authorization to use military force, a declaration of war, or any simi-lar authority, on its own, shall not be construed to authorize the imprison-ment or detention without charge or trial of a citizen or lawful permanent resident of the United States appre-hended in the United States.’’ 
Like the previous version, this bill 
amends the Non-Detention Act to cod-ify the Second Circuit’s ‘‘Clear State-ment Rule’’ from the Padilla case. So new subsection (a) will read, ‘‘No cit-izen or lawful permanent resident of the United States shall be imprisoned or otherwise detained by the United States except consistent with the Con-stitution and pursuant to an act of Congress that expressly authorizes such imprisonment or detention.’’ 
Making the Clear Statement Rule 
part of subsection (a) strengthens the Non-Detention Act even more by re-quiring Congress to be explicit if it wants to detain U.S. citizens indefi-nitely. Subsection (b) clarifies that an 
authorization to use military force, a declaration of war, or any similar au-thority does not authorize the indefi-nite detention of a U.S. citizen or a Lawful Permanent Resident of the U.S., also known as a Green Card hold-er. 
Some may ask why this legislation 
protects Green Card holders as well as citizens. And others may ask why the bill does not protect all persons’’ ap-prehended in the U.S. from indefinite detention. 
Let me make clear that I would sup-
port providing the protections in this amendment to all persons in the United States, whether lawfully or un-lawfully present. But the question comes, is there enough political sup-port to expand this amendment to cover others besides U.S. citizens and Green Card holders? 
Wherever we draw the line on who 
should be covered by this legislation, I believe it violates fundamental Amer-ican rights to allow anyone appre-hended on U.S. soil to be detained without charge or trial. 
The FBI and other law enforcement 
agencies have proven, time and again, that they are up to the challenge of de-tecting, stopping, arresting, and con-victing terrorists found on U.S. soil, having successfully arrested, detained and convicted hundreds of these hei-nous people, both before and after 9/11. 
Specifically, there have been 556 ter-
rorism-related convictions in federal criminal court between 9/11 and the end of 2013, according to the Department of Justice. 
Also, it is important to understand 
that suspected terrorists who may be in the U.S. illegally can be detained within the criminal justice system using at least the following 4 options: 
They can be charged with a Federal 
or State crime and held; they can be held for violating immigration laws; they can be held as material witnesses as part of Federal grand jury pro-ceedings; and they can be held for up to 6 months under Section 412 of the Pa-triot Act. 
I want to be very clear about what 
this bill is and is not about. It is not about whether citizens such as Hamdi and Padilla, or others who would do us harm, should be captured, interro-gated, incarcerated, and severely pun-ished. They should be. 
But what about an innocent Amer-
ican? What about someone in the wrong place at the wrong time? The beauty of our Constitution is that it gives everyone in the United States basic due process rights to a trial by a jury of their peers. 
As President Obama said when refer-
ring to the indefinite detention of non- Americans at Guantanamo: 
‘‘Imagine a future—10 years from now or 20 
years from now—when the United States of America is still holding people who have been charged with no crime on a piece of land that is not part of our country. . . . Is that who we are? Is that something that our Founders foresaw? Is that the America we 
want to leave to our children? Our sense of justice is stronger than that.’’ 
The same questions could be asked of 
those who would indefinitely detain Americans arrested on U.S. soil. 
Is that who we are? Does that reflect the America we 
want to leave to our children? 
Now is the time to clarify U.S. law to 
state unequivocally that the govern-ment cannot indefinitely detain Amer-ican citizens and Green Card holders captured inside this country without trial or charge. 
The Federal Government experi-
mented with indefinite detention of U.S. citizens during World War II, a 
mistake we now recognize as a betrayal of our core values. 
Let us not repeat it. I urge my col-
leagues to support this legislation. 
By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself 
and Mr. G RAHAM ): 
S. 27. A bill to make wildlife traf-
ficking a predicate offense under rack-eteering and money laundering stat-utes and the Travel Act, to provide for the use for conservation purposes of amounts from civil penalties, fines, forfeitures, and restitution under such statutes based on such violations, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I 
rise today to introduce the Wildlife Trafficking Enforcement Act of 2015, which I authored along with my col-league Senator L
INDSEY GRAHAM . 
This bill will allow the Federal Gov-
ernment to crack down on poachers and transnational criminal organiza-tions involved in the global trade in il-legal wildlife products. 
Wildlife trafficking has become a 
global crime that the State Depart-ment estimates is valued at between $8 to $10 billion annually. This ranks it as one of the most lucrative types of orga-nized crime in the world, along with drug and human trafficking. 
Besides being a major international 
crime, wildlife trafficking is a morally repugnant practice that threatens some of our world’s most iconic species with extinction. 
The most disturbing example is that 
of elephants and rhinoceroses. A recent study estimates that over 100,000 ele-phants were illegally poached in Africa from 2010 to 2012. At this rate, the Afri-can elephant is being killed faster than the species can reproduce, putting it at risk of being wiped off the face of the earth. 
Most disturbingly, poachers are 
slaughtering very young and juvenile elephants for their tusks due to the record high demand for ivory in places like China and the United States. 
But the illicit ivory trade is not just 
a threat to African elephants; it is also a problem for global security. The State Department reports that there is increasing evidence that wildlife traf-ficking is funding armed insurgencies like Al Shabaab and the Lord’s Resist-ance Army. The illegal ivory trade fuels corruption and violence in Africa.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S15 January 6, 2015 
The rhinoceros has also been deci-
mated by poaching due to record high demand for its horn. Conservation or-ganizations estimate that hundreds of rhinoceroses are illegally slaughtered in Africa each year. It is deeply con-cerning that the poaching rate for rhi-noceroses in Africa appears to be in-creasing. 
Some populations of rhinoceroses are 
on the brink of extinction. The popu-lation of the Sumatran rhinoceros has plummeted by over 50 percent in the last two decades due to poaching, and it is estimated that only about 100 re-main in existence. It is estimated that fewer than 10 Northern White Rhinoc-eroses remain alive in the wild. 
The problem is not just confined to 
elephants and rhinoceroses. Tigers, leopards, endangered sea turtles, and many other wildlife species are being decimated by poaching. 
At its core, this legislation increases 
criminal penalties for wildlife traf-ficking crimes. The federal government needs stiffer penalties in order to go after organized and high volume traf-fickers. The President asked for this authority in the National Strategy to Combat Wildlife Trafficking released last year. 
Specifically, this bill makes viola-
tions of the Endangered Species Act, the African Elephant Conservation Act, and the Rhinoceros and Tiger Con-servation Act that involve more than $10,000 of illegal wildlife products pred-icate offenses under the money laun-dering and racketeering statutes and the Travel Act. 
Currently, each of these wildlife laws 
carries a maximum prison sentence of only one year for a violation. Under this bill, wildlife trafficking violations can be subject to up to a 20-year prison sentence, as well as increased fines and penalties of up to $500,000 for an of-fense. 
These new penalties will allow the 
government to change the equation on wildlife crimes. Wildlife trafficking has increased at dramatic rates because the crime is high value and low risk due to weak penalties across the world. Under the new authorities, the Federal Government will have a full range of tools to prosecute the worst wildlife trafficking offenders and to put them behind bars with significant sentences. The new authorities will also act as a deterrent to the criminal organizations currently trafficking illicit wildlife products into and through the United States. 
As one of the largest markets for 
products of illicit poaching in the world, the United States has a respon-sibility to step up and help to combat this scourge. With this legislation, the United States will set an example for other countries on the need for each country to strengthen penalties for wildlife trafficking. It is critical that other nations around the world with large markets for illicit wildlife prod-ucts step up to tackle this global prob-lem. The Wildlife Trafficking Enforce-
ment Act of 2015 will also allow fines, penalties, forfeitures, and restitution recovered through use of the bill’s new authorities to be transferred to estab-lished conservation funds at the De-partments of the Interior and of Com-merce. This will enable the Federal Government to use the monetary pen-alties from a wildlife trafficking con-viction to benefit the species that was harmed. Thus, the bill will both act to punish and deter criminals while sup-porting the conservation of those spe-cies that are directly harmed by poach-ing. 
Addressing the issue of wildlife traf-
ficking speaks to our values and mor-als as a Nation. We have a responsi-bility to help prevent these endangered species, which have existed for thou-sands of years, from becoming extinct in our lifetime. It is also clear that Federal law’s weak penalties for wild-life crimes have been exploited by poachers and transnational criminals. 
I therefore ask all of my colleagues 
on both sides of the aisle to work with me to enact this legislation this year. The stakes for endangered species like elephants, tigers, and rhinoceroses could not be higher. If we don’t crack down on wildlife trafficking, we will be complicit in the slaughter.

S. 28. A bill to limit the use of cluster 
munitions; to the Committee on For-eign Relations. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I 
rise today with my colleagues Senators 
L
EAHY , B OXER , D URBIN , K LOBUCHAR , 
MURRAY , UDALL , FRANKEN , WYDEN and 
WHITEHOUSE to introduce the Cluster 
Munitions Civilian Protection Act of 2015. 
Our legislation places common sense 
restrictions on the use of cluster muni-tions. It prevents any funds from being spent to use cluster munitions that have a failure rate of more than one percent. 
In addition, the rules of engagement 
must specify that: cluster munitions will only be used against clearly de-fined military targets; and will not be used where civilians are known to be present or in areas normally inhabited by civilians. 
Our legislation also includes a na-
tional security waiver that allows the President to waive the prohibition on the use of cluster munitions with a failure rate of more than one percent if he determines it is vital to protect the security of the United States to do so. 
However, if the President decides to 
waive the prohibition, he must issue a report to Congress within 30 days on the failure rate of the cluster muni-tions used and the steps taken to pro-tect innocent civilians. 
Cluster munitions are large bombs, 
rockets, or artillery shells that contain up to hundreds of small submunitions, 
or individual ‘‘bomblets.’’ 
They are intended for attacking 
enemy troop and armor formations spread over a wide area. 
But, in reality, they pose a far more 
deadly threat to innocent civilians. 
According to the Cluster Munitions 
Monitor, over the past fifty years, there have been 19,419 documented cluster munitions deaths in 31 nations. The estimated number of total cluster munitions casualties, however, is an astonishing 55,000 people. 
While cluster munitions are intended 
for military targets, in actuality civil-ians have accounted for 94% of cluster munition casualties. 
Death and injury from unexploded 
ordnance left behind by cluster muni-tions continues to kill civilians to this day. Today, 23 States remain contami-nated by unexploded ordnance left from cluster munitions. 
Last year, nine of these countries 
suffered casualties from unexploded ordnance. They were: Croatia, Iraq, Laos, Lebanon, Cambodia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria and Vietnam. 
More tragically, despite the risk they 
pose to civilians, cluster bombs con-tinue to be used in conflicts. 
Since July 2012, Syrian government 
forces have used cluster munitions in 10 of the country’s 14 governates. 
Human Rights Watch has docu-
mented that the Syrian government has used seven types of cluster muni-tions to date, six of which were manu-factured in the former Soviet Union and the seventh of which is Egyptian- made. 
In 2012 and 2013, the Landmine and 
Cluster Munition Monitor recorded 1,584 deaths from government-launched cluster munitions in Syria. Approxi-mately 97 percent of the deaths di-rectly linked to cluster munitions were civilians. 
For the first time, Human Rights 
Watch has also obtained evidence that the Islamic State of Iraq and the Le-vant, known as ISIL, has also used cluster bombs. 
According to witness testimony and 
photographic evidence, ISIL used clus-ter bombs on at least two occasions near the besieged town of Kobani. 
Terrorist groups and other non-state 
actors would not be able to obtain and use cluster bombs if the world adopted the Oslo Treaty on Cluster munitions. 
The Oslo Treaty bans the production, 
sale, stockpiling and use of cluster mu-nitions. It came into effect in 2010 and to date has been ratified by 88 nations. 
Under the Treaty, 22 nations have de-
stroyed 1.16 million cluster bombs and nearly 140 million submunitions. 
Unfortunately, the United States is 
neither a signatory nor state party to the Oslo Treaty. 
In fact, the United States maintains 
a stockpile of 5.5 million cluster muni-tions containing 728 million submuni-tions. These bomblets have an esti-mated failure rate of between 5 and 15 percent.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S16 January 6, 2015 
Rather than adopting the increasing 
international consensus that cluster bombs should be banned, the Pentagon continues to assert that they are ‘‘le-gitimate weapons with clear military utility in combat.’’ 
I respectfully disagree. The benefit of 
using cluster bombs is outweighed by the continuing threat they pose to ci-vilians long after the cessation of hos-tilities. 
The Cluster Munitions Civilian Pro-
tection Act would immediately ban cluster bombs with unacceptable unexploded ordnance rates and in areas where civilians are known to be present. 
Passing this legislation would move 
the United States closer to abiding by the requirements of the Oslo Treaty, which has been ratified by many of our allies, including the United Kingdom, France and Germany. 
Since 2008 the Congress has banned 
the export of cluster munitions with a greater than one percent unexploded ordnance rate. While banning the ex-port of these indiscriminate weapons was a positive first step, I strongly be-lieve the United States can do better. 
This body cannot compel the admin-
istration to sign the Oslo Treaty. How-ever, we can surely take steps to abide by its spirit. Passing the Cluster Muni-tions Civilian Protection Act would do exactly that. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
bill.

S. 29. A bill to repeal the Defense of 
Marriage Act and ensure respect for State regulation of marriage; to the Committee on the Judiciary. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I 
rise today to introduce a bill to fully repeal the Defense of Marriage Act, DOMA, and ensure that married same- sex couples are accorded equal treat-ment by the federal government. 
When I first introduced this bill in 
2011, only 5 States and the District of Columbia recognized same-sex mar-riage. 
Today, due to a combination of ac-
tions by legislatures, voters, and the courts, 36 States and D.C. recognize same-sex marriage. Florida joined the group just this week. This progress is nothing short of 
amazing. Over 70 percent of Americans now live in a State where same-sex couples can marry. 
The Supreme Court’s landmark deci-
sion in United States v. Windsor, which struck down Section 3 of DOMA, has caused most federal agencies to accord equal rights and responsibilities to married same-sex couples. 
But, despite this progress, the mis-
sion of ensuring full equality under Federal law for married same-sex cou-ples is still unaccomplished. 
This bill will accomplish that mis-
sion. It will strike DOMA from Federal law, and ensure that legally married same-sex couples are treated equally by the federal government, period. 
I want to thank my 41 colleagues who 
have cosponsored this bill. 
For my colleagues who have not yet 
supported this bill: if you believe that couples who are married should be treated that way by the federal govern-ment, you should cosponsor this bill. It is as simple as that. 
Two major agencies, which serve mil-
lions and millions of Americans—the Social Security Administration and Department of Veterans Affairs—still deny benefits to some married couples depending on where the couple has lived. This bill would fix that problem. 
Let me address Social Security first. 
An example of the discrimination mar-ried same-sex couples still face is the case of Kathy Murphy and Sara Bark-er. According to a legal filing, this cou-ple married in Massachusetts and shared a ranch house in Texas for near-ly 30 years. 
In 2010, when Sara was 60 years old, 
she was diagnosed with an aggressive form of cancer. Sara went through sev-eral surgeries and chemotherapy, and Kathy was Sara’s caregiver. 
Sara passed away on March 10, 2012. 
As the complaint states: ‘‘Kathy lost her partner of more than thirty years and the love of her life.’’ 
In July 2014—over a year after she ap-
plied—Kathy’s application for sur-vivor’s benefits from Social Security was denied because they lived in Texas together, and Texas does not recognize them as married. 
This cost her an estimated $1,200 per 
month in Federal survivor’s benefits. 
Veterans and active-duty military 
personnel in same-sex marriages also are being denied equal treatment by the Department of Veterans Affairs. 
Many of these brave individuals have 
served our country overseas or in war zones, but they may nevertheless be de-nied a huge range of benefits our na-tion grants to those who have served in the Armed Forces. 
A court filing by the American Mili-
tary Partners Association explains that: 
lesbian and gay veterans and their spouses 
and survivors . . . will be denied or disadvan-taged in obtaining spousal veterans benefits such as disability compensation, death pen-sion benefits, home loan guarantees, and rights to burial together in national ceme-teries. This is wrong. Our married gay and 
lesbian soldiers put their lives on the line for our country the same way other soldiers do. 
We owe them the same debt of grati-
tude we owe to all other men and women who serve, and this bill would ensure that we fulfill that solemn obli-gation. 
Continued discrimination against 
married same-sex couples is not lim-ited to these benefits programs. 
Other Federal laws are not part of 
programs administered by agencies, but they nevertheless are designed to protect families, including spouses. 
Let me just give one example—Sec-
tion 115 of Title 18. Among other things, this law makes it a crime to as-sault, kidnap, or murder a spouse of Federal law enforcement officer, with 
the intent to influence or retaliate against the officer. 
This law protects the ability of peo-
ple like FBI agents and federal pros-ecutors to serve the public knowing there is protection from violence against their families. 
These agents and prosecutors inves-
tigate and prosecute people like drug kingpins, terrorists, and organized crime figures. 
But, even today, it is not clear 
whether this vital protection for these officers covers those in lawful same- sex marriages everywhere in the coun-try. 
These public servants, who protect 
all of us, should not have to worry that they lack the full protection we pro-vide to their colleagues—but that is the situation we confront today. This 
bill would fix it. 
In addition, Section 2 of DOMA— 
which was not expressly addressed by the Supreme Court—continues to pose a serious risk to legal relief received by victims of crime and civil wrongs. This bill would repeal it. 
Section 2 of DOMA is the full faith 
and credit provision of DOMA, and it has been the subject of many mis-conceptions. 
When DOMA was enacted, some 
claimed Section 2 was designed to pre-vent the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the Constitution from forcing a state to recognize a marriage from an-other state. 
But states have never needed permis-
sion from Congress to decide whether to recognize an out-of-state marriage. States have done that under their own laws, subject to other constitutional guarantees like the Equal Protection Clause. 
Thus, repealing Section 2 of DOMA 
simply would not force a State, or a re-ligious institution, to recognize a par-ticular marriage. 
While it is on the books, Section 2 
may have a very serious impact: it may nullify legal relief awarded to victims of crime and other civil wrongs. 
There is a general rule that the judg-
ments of one state’s courts will be en-forced in another state’s courts. 
But Section 2 purports to exempt any 
‘‘right or claim arising from’’ a same- sex marriage from this rule.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S17 January 6, 2015 
Imagine a woman killed by a drunk 
driver. Her surviving spouse would have a civil claim for wrongful death, or might obtain restitution in a crimi-nal case. 
But DOMA could prevent the court 
judgments in those cases from being enforced in the perpetrator’s home State, allowing him to avoid the con-sequences of his actions. 
The same problem could arise in nu-
merous types of cases, such as assaults, batteries, and insurance claims. 
Same-sex married couples are the 
only class of people who are burdened by this sort of legal disability, which hinders the court system from pro-tecting them the same way that it does other citizens. 
This is wrong, and it must be re-
pealed. 
As a Senator from California, I come 
to this bill with a strong sense of his-tory. 
In 1948, the California Supreme Court 
became the first state court to find that a ban on interracial marriage vio-lates the Equal Protection Clause. At the time, 29 states still prohibited interracial marriage. 
Prohibitions on interracial marriage 
then were eliminated in 13 other states, so that when the Supreme Court de-cided Loving v. Virginia in 1967, only 16 states retained bans on interracial marriage. 
I very much hope that is where we 
are today on same-sex marriage. 
People of all stripes have come to be-
lieve that loving and committed same- sex couples are worthy of the same dig-nity and respect other couples receive. Public opinion has changed dramati-cally, and 36 states now recognize same-sex marriage. 
The tide has shifted, I hope irrevers-
ibly so. 
But here, in Congress, we still have 
work to do. 
We must end the discrimination mar-
ried same-sex couples continue to face at the federal level. 
DOMA remains on the books, where 
it should never have been placed. It could be revived by a different Su-preme Court majority. 
A future administration also could 
interpret other laws differently than this Administration has done, poten-tially restricting the availability of key benefits even further. 
The solution is simple: pass this bill, 
which would eliminate DOMA and ac-cord equal treatment under Federal law for married same-sex couples. 
Let me again thank my cosponsors 
for joining me in this effort, and to urge my other colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this legislation.

legislation would raise the threshold for ‘‘full-time’’ work in Obamacare to the standard 40 hours a week. This is consistent with the threshold for over-time eligibility under the Fair Labor Standards Act, and the common-sense understanding of ‘‘full-time’’ work. 
Under Obamacare, an employee 
working just 30 hours a week is defined as ‘‘full-time,’’ a definition that is completely out-of-step with standard employment practices in the U.S. today. According to a survey published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average American actually works 8.7 hours per day, which equates to rough-ly 44 hours a week. The Obamacare def-inition is nearly one-third lower than actual practice. 
Similarly, the Obamacare definition 
of ‘‘full-time’’ employee is ten hours a week fewer than the 40 hours per week used by the GAO in its study of the budget and staffing required by the IRS to implement Obamacare. In that re-port, the GAO described a ‘‘full-time equivalent’’ as: ‘‘a measure of staff hours equal to those of an employee who works 2,080 hours per year, or 40 hours per week . . . .’’ Even the Office 
of Management and Budget recognizes that 30–hours is not ‘‘full-time.’’ A cir-cular it issued to Federal agencies ac-tually directs them to calculate staff-ing levels using more than 40 hours a week as a ‘‘full-time equivalent.’’ 
The effect of using the 30–hour a 
week threshold is to artificially drive- up the number of ‘‘full-time’’ workers for purposes of calculating the pen-alties to which employers are exposed under Obamacare. These penalties begin at $40,000 for businesses with 50 employees, plus $2,000 for each addi-tional ‘‘full-time equivalent’’ em-ployee. While these draconian penalities were scheduled to begin in January of last year, we have yet to feel their full effect because the Obama administration delayed their imple-mentation through 2014, perhaps know-ing the negative impact that will re-sult. But that artificial grace-period expired January 1 for employers with 100 or more workers and will end for employers with between 50 and 99 em-ployees in January of next year. 
Needless to say, these penalties will 
force many employers to restrict or re-duce the hours their employees are al-lowed to work, so they are no longer considered ‘‘full-time’’ for the purposes of the law. In addition, these penalties will discourage employers from grow-ing or adding jobs, particularly those close to the 50–job trigger. 
These are not hypothetical concerns. 
According to the Investors Business Daily, more than 450 employers had cut 
work hours or staffing levels in re-sponse to Obamacare as of September of last year. Employees of for-profit businesses are not the only ones threatened by Obamacare’s illogical definition of full-time work. Public sector employees and those who work for non-profits are also affected. 
I am concerned that educators, 
school employees, and students will be particularly hard hit. As the ASAA, the School Superintendents Associa-tion, explained in a letter in support of our bill, Obamacare’s 30–hour threshold puts an ‘‘undue burden on school sys-tems across the Nation, many of [which] will struggle to staff their schools to meet their educational mis-sion’’ while complying with this re-quirement. 
For example, the school super-
intendent of Bangor, ME, has told me that Obamacare will require that school district to reduce substitute teacher hours to make sure they don’t exceed 29 hours a week. This will harm not only the substitute teachers who want and need more work, but it will also harm students by causing unneces-sary disruption in the classroom. 
Likewise, in Indiana, a county school 
district had to reduce the hours of part-time school bus drivers to make sure they do not work more than the 30–hour threshold. As a result, the school district has been forced to cut field trips and transportation to ath-letic events, and employees who used to work more than 30 hours total in two jobs have been forced to give up one of their jobs, hurting their finan-cial security. 
The 30–hour rule will also affect our 
Nation’s institutions of higher edu-cation. According to the College and University Professional Association for Human Resources, Obamacare’s full- time work definition has already caused 122 schools to announce new policies capping hours for students and faculty. 
It is troubling that the 30–hour 
threshold will also harm delivery of home care services. The requirement will likely result in reduced access to needed services for some of our Na-tion’s most vulnerable citizens: home- bound seniors, individuals with disabil-ities, and recently discharged hospital and nursing home patients. Informa-tion provided to my office by the Home Care & Hospice Alliance of Maine shows that many of its member organi-zations will be forced to reduce work hours for employees or even to cease operations due to Obamacare’s defini-tion of ‘‘full-time’’ work. If that hap-pens, hundreds of home care workers could lose their jobs, and a thousand seniors could lose access to home care services—in Maine alone. 
Data from Maine’s Medicaid program 
show that home care services are ex-tremely cost-effective compared to al-ternatives. Thus, by making it harder for home care service providers to give their workers the hours they need,

Obamacare’s definition of ‘‘full-time’’ 
work will end up reducing the home care services available to seniors, de-priving them of care or forcing them into costlier care, driving up Federal costs. 
Before I close, I would like to read a 
few lines from a letter I recently re-ceived from Randy Wadleigh, the owner of a well-known and much-loved res-taurant institution in Maine called ‘‘Governor’s.’’ Randy’s letter sums up what Maine employers have always told me—their employees are the heart and souls of their businesses, and are the face of their companies to the pub-lic. As Randy puts it, businesses recog-nize the importance of their workers ‘‘because without GREAT employees, businesses really don’t have anything. [The 30–hour threshold] is hurting many of our employees. They don’t un-derstand it, they can’t afford it and they just want to work more hours.’’ 
The bipartisan bill we are intro-
ducing today will protect these work-ers by changing the definition of ‘‘full- time’’ work in the ACA to 40 hours a week, and making a corresponding change in the definition of ‘‘full-time equivalent’’ employee to 174 hours per month. This is a sensible definition in keeping with actual practice. 
Among the many organizations that 
have endorsed our bill are: the College & University Professional Association for Human Resources, the National As-sociation for Home Care & Hospice, the American Hotel & Lodging Associa-tion, the American Staffing Associa-tion, the Asian American Hotel Owners Association, the Associated Builders and Contractors, the Food Marketing Institute, the International Franchise Association, the National Association of Convenience Stores, the National Association of Health Underwriters, the American Rental Association, the National Association of Manufacturers, the National Association of Theatre Owners, the National Grocers Associa-tion, the National Federation of Inde-pendent Business, the National Res-taurant Association, the National Re-tail Federation, the Retail Industry Leaders Association, ASAA, the School Superintendents Association, the Soci-ety for Human Resource Management, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. 
Regardless of the varying views of 
Senators on the Affordable Care Act, surely we ought to be able to agree to fix this problem in the law that is hurt-ing workers’ paychecks and creating chaos for employers. I urge my col-leagues to support this bipartisan leg-islation. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the letters of support be printed in the R

DEAR SENATOR COLLINS : On behalf of 
AASA: The School Superintendents Associa-tion, the Association of Educational Service 
Agencies, the National Rural Education As-sociation and the National Rural Education Advocacy Coalition, I write to express our support for the Forty Hours is Full Time Act. Collectively, we represent public school superintendents, educational service agency administrators and school system leaders across the country, as well as our nation’s rural schools and communities. We have fol-lowed closely the Affordable Care Act and stand ready to implement the law, and see your proposed legislation as one way to al-leviate an unnecessarily burdensome regula-tion. 
The Forty House is Full Time Act would 
change the definition of ‘‘full time’’ in the Affordable Care Act (ACA) to 40 hours per week and the number of hours counted to-ward a ‘‘full time equivalent’’ employee to 174 hours per month. The current ACA arbi-trarily sets the bar for a full work week to 30 hours. This is inconsistent with how most Americans think: full-time is a 40 hour work week. The current definition causes confu-sion among employers who struggle to un-derstand and comply with the new require-ments, especially ones that are in conflict with long-standing practices built on the long-standing 40-hour work week premise. 
We welcome the opportunity to ensure our 
employees have a positive work environment and we remain committed to providing a ro-bust set of work benefits. We are concerned that the ACA, as currently written, puts ad-ditional, undue burden on school systems across the nation, many of whom will strug-gle to staff their schools to meet their edu-cational mission while meeting the strict 30- hour regulation. 
We applaud your continued leadership on 
this issue and look forward to seeing the Forty Hours is Full Time Act move forward. 
Sincerely,

Re Definition of full time hours for the ACA 
Hon. S USAN COLLINS , 
413 Dirksen Office Building, Washington, DC. 
D
EARSUSAN : Governor’s Restaurants have 
been a staple in Maine since 1959. We have 6 locations and employ over 300 full and part time fine Maine folks while serving the great people of Maine. In general, we’ve had lon-gevity because we pay attention to business and play by the rules dictated to us by local, state and federal agencies. In a nutshell, we take pride in doing the right things. 
As our company’s CEO, I recently con-
ducted health insurance enrollment meet-ings at all of our locations for those 100+ eli-gible full time employees (as currently de-fined at 30 hours per week}. We are strongly in favor of changing the current definition of a full time employee from 30 hours to 40 hours . . . but not necessarily for the rea-son(s} you may think. 
On behalf of our employees, we’ve just got 
to increase the threshold to 40 hours. Our of-fered health plan is defined as affordable and meets minimum standards as defined by the law, but when you express to the employee that they must contribute +/ ¥$30 per week it 
becomes a heartfelt choice to pay for food, child care, rent OR pay for health care. On more than one occasion, I had employees (all of whom worked less than 32 hours per week} break down in tears because they just can’t afford coverage. At the same time, those 
that worked over 38 hours, were more likely to participate and in fact could afford cov-erage. 
When ACA was first introduced, I could 
never understand why the law defined 30 hours per week. Our company has had to make dramatic cuts in hours to some staff-ers to reduce exposure. But once again this hurts the employee. 
So you see the obvious selfish thing to do 
as a business person is to cry foul about the health care law and how it affects our bot-tom line. But our company takes a bit of a different approach. We recognize the impor-tance of our people because without GREAT employees, business owners really don’t have anything. This law is hurting many of our employees. They don’t understand it, they can’t afford it and they just want to work more hours. 30 hours is too restrictive to them. 40 would be better for them and ulti-mately for business and such change would benefit both the employee and the employer. 
Thanks for your great work in Washington. 
Sincerely,

and Ms. H EITKAMP ): 
S. 32. A bill to provide the Depart-
ment of Justice with additional tools 
to target extraterritorial drug traf-ficking activity, and for other pur-poses; to the Committee on Finance. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I 
am pleased to introduce the Transnational Drug Trafficking Act of 2015 with my colleagues and friends, Senators C
HARLES GRASSLEY , RICHARD  
BLUMENTHAL , H EIDI HEITKAMP , A MY 
KLOBUCHAR and T OMUDALL . 
This bill, which passed the Senate 
unanimously in the last Congress, sup-ports the Obama Administration’s Strategy to Combat Transnational Or-ganized Crime by providing the Depart-ment of Justice with crucial tools to combat the international drug trade. As drug traffickers find new and inno-vative ways to avoid prosecution, we cannot allow them to exploit loopholes because our laws lag behind. 
This legislation has three main com-
ponents. First, it puts in place pen-alties for extraterritorial drug traf-ficking activity when individuals have reasonable cause to believe that illegal drugs will be trafficked into the United States. Current law says that drug traffickers must know that illegal drugs will be trafficked into the United States and this legislation would lower the knowledge threshold to reasonable cause to believe. 
The Department of Justice has in-
formed my office that, it sees drug traffickers from countries like Colom-bia, Bolivia and Peru who produce co-caine but then outsource transpor-tation of the cocaine to the United States to violent Mexican drug traf-ficking organizations. Under current law, our ability to prosecute source-na-tion traffickers from these countries is limited since there is often no direct evidence of their knowledge that ille-gal drugs were intended for the United

States. But let me be clear: drugs pro-
duced in these countries fuel violent crime throughout the Western Hemi-sphere as well as addiction and death in the United States. 
Second, this bill puts in place pen-
alties for precursor chemical producers from foreign countries, such as those producing pseudoephedrine used for methamphetamine, who illegally ship precursor chemicals into the United States knowing that these chemicals will be used to make illegal drugs. 
Third, this bill makes a technical fix 
to the Counterfeit Drug Penalty En-hancement Act, which increases pen-alties for the trafficking of counterfeit drugs. The fix, requested by the De-partment of Justice, puts in place a ‘‘knowing’’ requirement which was un-intentionally left out of the original bill. The original bill makes the mere sale of a counterfeit drug a Federal fel-ony offense regardless of whether the seller knew the drug was counterfeit. Under the original bill, a pharmacist could be held criminally liable if he or she unwittingly sold counterfeit drugs to a customer. Adding a ‘‘knowing’’ re-quirement corrects this problem. 
As Co-Chair of the Senate Caucus on 
International Narcotics Control and as a public servant who has focused on narcotics issues for many years, I know that we cannot sit idly by as drug traf-fickers find new ways to circumvent our laws. The illegal drug trade is con-stantly evolving and it is critical that our legal framework keeps pace. We must provide the Department of Jus-tice with all of the tools it needs to prosecute drug kingpins both here at home and abroad.

HOUSE ): 
S. 36. A bill to address the continued 
threat posed by dangerous synthetic drugs by amending the Controlled Sub-stances Act relating to controlled sub-stance analogues; to the Committee on the Judiciary. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I 
am pleased to introduce the Protecting Our Youth from Dangerous Synthetic Drugs Act of 2015, with my colleagues, Senators K
ELLY AYOTTE , R ICHARD  
BLUMENTHAL , B ARBARA BOXER , A MY 
KLOBUCHAR , R OBPORTMAN , C HARLES  
SCHUMER , JEANNE SHAHEEN and S HEL-
DON WHITEHOUSE . This legislation ad-
dresses the significant harm that syn-thetic drugs cause our communities. 
When Congress outlawed several syn-
thetic drugs in 2012, traffickers did not stop producing them. Instead, they slightly altered the drugs’ chemical structure to skirt the law, producing ‘‘controlled substance analogues’’ which are dangerous, chemically simi-lar to Schedule I substances, and mimic the effects of drugs like ecstasy, cocaine, PCP, and LSD. 
Manufacturers of synthetic drugs 
often prey upon youth, selling products such as Scooby Snax, Potpourri, and 
Joker Herbal. But make no mistake: these products are dangerous. In the first ten months of 2014 alone, poison centers nationwide responded to ap-proximately 3,900 calls related to syn-thetic drugs. 
Under current law, determining 
whether a substance meets the vague legal criteria of a ‘‘controlled sub-stance analogue’’ results in a ‘‘battle of experts’’ inside the courtroom. Signifi-cantly, a substance ruled to be an ana-logue in one case is not automatically an analogue in a second case. 
The Protecting Our Youth from Dan-
gerous Synthetics Drug Act addresses these issues. This bill creates an inter-agency committee of scientists that will establish and maintain an admin-istrative list of controlled substance analogues. The Committee is struc-tured to respond quickly when new synthetic drugs enter the market. 
Because virtually all of these con-
trolled substance analogues arrive in bulk from outside our borders, the bill makes it illegal to import a controlled substance analogue on the list unless the importation is intended for non- human use. 
Finally, the bill directs the U.S. Sen-
tencing Commission to review, and if appropriate, amend the Federal sen-tencing guidelines for violations of the Controlled Substances Act pertaining to controlled substance analogues. 
In sum, this bill sends a strong mes-
sage to drug traffickers who attempt to circumvent our Nation’s laws: no mat-ter how you alter the chemical struc-ture of synthetic drugs to try to get around the law, we will ban these sub-stances to keep them away from our children. 
By Mr. REED (for himself and 
Mr. B ROWN ): 
S. 37. A bill to amend the Elementary 
and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to provide for State accountability in the provision of access to the core re-sources for learning, and for other pur-poses; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, today, I 
am pleased to reintroduce the Core Op-portunity Resources for Equity and Ex-cellence Act with my colleague Sen-ator Brown. I would also like to thank Representative Fudge for introducing companion legislation in the House of Representatives. This year, we will be commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Elementary and Secondary Edu-cation Act. Now is the time to reaffirm our commitment to educational equity, and in the words of President Johnson ‘‘bridge the gap between helplessness and hope.’’ 
As we embark upon reauthorizing 
this landmark legislation, we must en-sure that our accountability systems in education measure our progress to-wards equity and excellence for all children. The CORE Act will help ad-vance that goal by requiring states to include fair and equitable access to the core resources for learning in their ac-
countability systems. 
More than 60 years after the land-
mark decision of Brown v. Board of Education, one of the great challenges still facing this nation is stemming the tide of rising inequality. We have seen the rich get richer while middle class and low-income families have lost ground. We see disparities in oppor-tunity starting at birth and growing over a lifetime. With more than one in five school-aged children living in fam-ilies in poverty, according to Depart-ment of Education statistics, we can-not afford nor should we tolerate a public education system that fails to provide resources and opportunities for the children who need them the most. 
We should look to hold our education 
system accountable for results and re-sources. And we know that resources matter. A recent study by researchers at Northwestern University and the University of California at Berkeley found that increasing per pupil spend-ing by 20 percent for low-income stu-
dents over the course of their K–12 schooling results in greater high school completion, higher levels of edu-cational attainment, increased lifetime earnings, and reduced adult poverty. 
In addition to funding, there are 
other opportunity gaps that we need to address. Survey data from the Depart-ment of Education’s Office of Civil Rights show troubling disparities, such as the fact that Black, Latino, Amer-ican Indian, Native Alaskan students, and English learners attend schools with higher concentrations of inexperi-enced teachers; nationwide, one in five high schools lacks a school counselor; and between 10 and 25 percent of high schools across the nation do not offer more than one of the core courses in the typical sequence of high school math and science, such as Algebra I and II, geometry, biology, and chem-istry. 
We are reintroducing the CORE Act 
to ensure that equity remains at the center of our federal education policy. Specifically, the CORE Act will require state accountability plans and state and district report cards to include measures on how well the state and districts provide the core resources for learning to their students. These re-sources include: high quality instruc-tional teams, including licensed and profession-ready teachers, principals, school librarians, counselors, and edu-cation support staff; rigorous academic standards and curricula that lead to college and career readiness by high school graduation and are accessible to all students, including students with disabilities and English learners; equi-table and instructionally appropriate class sizes; up-to-date instructional materials, technology, and supplies; ef-fective school library programs; school facilities and technology, including physically and environmentally sound buildings and well-equipped instruc-tional space, including laboratories and libraries; specialized instructional sup-port teams, such as counselors, social

workers, nurses, and other qualified 
professionals; and effective family and community engagement programs. 
These are things that parents in well- 
resourced communities expect and de-mand. We should do no less for children in economically disadvantaged commu-nities. We should do no less for minor-ity students or English learners or stu-dents with disabilities. 
Under the CORE Act, States that fail 
to make progress on resource equity would not be eligible to apply for com-petitive grants authorized under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. For school districts identified for improvement, the State would have to identify gaps in access to the core re-sources for learning and develop an ac-tion plan in partnership with the local school district to address those gaps. 
The CORE Act is supported by a di-
verse group of organizations, including the American Association of Colleges of Teacher Education, American Fed-eration of Teachers, American Library Association, Coalition for Community Schools, Education Law Center, Fair Test, First Focus Campaign for Chil-dren, League of United Latin American Citizens, National Association of School Psychologists, National Edu-cation Association, National Latino Education Research and Policy Project, Opportunity Action, Public Advocacy for Kids, Public Advocates, Inc., Southeast Asia Resource Action Center, and the Texas Center for Edu-cation Policy. 
Working with this strong group of 
advocates and my colleagues in the Senate and in the House, it is my hope that we can build the support to in-clude the CORE Act in the reauthoriza-tion of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. I urge my colleagues to join us by cosponsoring this legisla-tion.

S. R ES. 20 
Resolved, 
SECTION 1. MOTIONS TO PROCEED. 
Paragraph 1 of rule XXII of the Standing 
Rules of the Senate is amended by inserting at the end the following new paragraph: 
‘‘Other than a motion made during the 
first 2 hours of a new legislative day as de-scribed in paragraph 2 of rule VIII, consider-ation of a motion to proceed to the consider-ation of any debatable matter, including de-bate on any debatable motion or appeal in connection therewith, shall be limited to not more than 2 hours, to be equally divided be-tween, and controlled by, the Majority Lead-er and the Minority Leader or their des-ignees. This paragraph shall not apply to motions considered nondebatable by the Sen-ate pursuant to rule or precedent.’’. 
SEC. 2. EXTENDED DEBATE. 
Paragraph 2 of rule XXII of the Standing 
Rules of the Senate is amended by striking the second undesignated paragraph and in-serting the following: 
‘‘Is it the sense of the Senate that the de-
bate shall be brought to a close? And if that question shall be decided in the affirmative by three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn, except on a measure or motion to amend the Senate rules, in which case the necessary affirmative vote shall be two- thirds of the Senators voting, a quorum being present, then cloture has been invoked. 
‘‘If that question is on disposition of a bill 
or joint resolution, a resolution or concur-rent resolution, a substitute amendment for a bill or resolution, a motion with respect to amendments between the Houses, a con-
ference report, or advice and consent to a nomination or treaty, and if such question shall be decided in the affirmative by a ma-jority of Senators voting, a quorum being present, but less than three-fifths of the Sen-ators duly chosen and sworn (or less than 
two-thirds of the Senators voting, a quorum being present, in the case of a measure or motion to amend the Senate rules), then it shall be in order for the Majority Leader (or his or her designee) to initiate a period of ex-tended debate upon the measure, motion, or other matter pending before the Senate, or the unfinished business, in relation to which the motion to close debate was offered, in which case the period of extended debate shall begin one hour later. 
‘‘During a period of extended debate, such 
measure, motion, or other matter pending before the Senate, or the unfinished busi-ness, shall be the unfinished business to the exclusion of all other business, except on ac-tion or motion by the Majority Leader (or his or her designee). 
‘‘During a period of extended debate it 
shall not be in order for a Senator other than the Majority Leader (or his or her designee) to raise a question as to the presence of a quorum, except immediately prior to a vote or when it has been more than forty-eight hours since a quorum was demonstrated. If upon a roll call it shall be ascertained that a quorum is not present, then the Senate shall adjourn to a time previously decided by order of the Senate or, if no such time has been established, then to a time certain de-termined by the Majority Leader, after con-sultation with the Minority Leader. 
‘‘During a period of extended debate a mo-
tion to adjourn or recess shall not be in order, unless made by the Majority Leader (or his or her designee) or if the absence of a quorum has been demonstrated. Notwith-standing paragraph 1 of rule XIX, there shall be no limit to the number of times a Senator may speak upon any question during a pe-riod of extended debate. 
‘‘If, during the course of extended debate, 
the Presiding Officer puts any question to a vote, the Majority Leader (or his or her des-ignee) may postpone any such vote, which shall occur at a time determined by the Ma-jority Leader, after consultation with the Minority Leader, but not later than the time at which a quorum is next demonstrated. 
‘‘If at any time during a period of extended 
debate no Senator seeks recognition, then the Presiding Officer shall inquire as to whether any Senator seeks recognition. If no Senator seeks recognition, then the Pre-siding Officer shall again put the question as to bringing debate to a close (and the Major-ity Leader or his or her designee may post-pone such vote in accordance with the pre-ceding paragraph), which shall be decided without further debate or intervening mo-tion. If that question shall be decided in the affirmative by a majority of Senators voting, a quorum being present, then cloture has been invoked and the period of extended de-bate has ended. If that question shall be de-cided in the negative by a majority of Sen-ators voting, a quorum being present, then the period of extended debate has ended. 
‘‘If cloture is invoked, then the measure, 
motion, other matter pending before the Senate, or the unfinished business, in rela-tion to which the motion to close debate was offered, shall remain the unfinished business to the exclusion of all other business until disposed of.’’. 
SEC. 3. POST-CLOTURE DEBATE ON NOMINA-
TIONS. 
Paragraph 2 of rule XXII of the Standing 
Rules of the Senate is amended by striking ‘‘After no more than thirty hours of consid-eration of the measure, motion, or other matter on which cloture has been invoked, 
the Senate shall proceed, without any fur-ther debate on any question, to vote on’’ in the fourth undesignated paragraph and in-serting ‘‘After no more than 30 hours of con-sideration of the measure, motion, or other matter on which cloture has been invoked, except on the question of advice and consent to a nomination other than a nomination to a position as Justice of the Supreme Court in which case consideration shall be limited to 2 hours, the Senate shall proceed, without any further debate on any question, to vote on’’. 
SEC. 4. CONFERENCE MOTIONS. 
Rule XXVIII of the Standing Rules of the 
Senate is amended by— 
(1) redesignating paragraphs 1 through 9 as 
paragraphs 2 through 10, respectively; 
(2) redesignating any reference to para-
graphs 1 through 9 as paragraph 2 through 10, respectively; and 
(3) inserting before paragraph 2, as redesig-
nated, the following: 
‘‘1. A nondivisible motion to disagree to a 
House amendment or insist upon a Senate amendment, to request a committee of con-ference with the House or to agree to a re-quest by the House for a committee of con-ference, and to authorize the Presiding Offi-cer to appoint conferees (or to appoint con-ferees), is in order and consideration of such a motion, including consideration of any de-batable motion or appeal in connection therewith, shall be limited to not more than 2 hours.’’. 
SEC. 5. RIGHT TO OFFER AMENDMENTS. 
Paragraph 2 of rule XXII of the Standing 
Rules of the Senate is amended by inserting at the end the following: 
‘‘After debate has concluded under this 
paragraph but prior to final disposition of the pending matter, the Majority Leader and the Minority Leader may each offer not to exceed 3 amendments identified as leadership amendments if they have been timely filed under this paragraph and are germane to the matter being amended. Debate on a leader-ship amendment shall be limited to 1 hour equally divided. A leadership amendment may not be divided.’’.

RESOLUTION OVER, UNDER THE

Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, I have a 
resolution at the desk of which Senator M
ERKLEY and I are cosponsors. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
clerk will read the resolution by title. 
The assistant legislative clerk read 
as follows: 
A resolution (S. Res. 20) limiting certain 
uses of the filibuster in the Senate to im-prove the legislative process. 
Mr. UDALL. I ask for its immediate 
consideration and to send the resolu-tion over, under the rule, I, therefore, object to my own request. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The resolution will go over, under 
the rule. 
Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, I rise 
today to talk about our continuing ef-fort to change the Senate rules as we begin the 114th Congress. This is the same process Senators M
ERKLEY , Har-
kin, and I used at the beginning of the last Congress when we introduced a similar resolution. At that time, Ma-jority Leader R
EIDwanted to have the 
debate about reforming our rules after the inauguration. 
He was willing to work with us and 
protect our interests until we could de-bate our proposal. By doing so, he pre-served the right of a simple majority of this body to amend the rules in accord-ance with article I, section 5 of the Constitution. 
I hope Majority Leader M
CCONNELL  
will extend to us this same courtesy if he chooses to address other issues be-fore rules reform. It has been the tradition at the be-
ginning of many Congresses that a ma-jority of the Senate has asserted its right to adopt or amend the rules. Just as Senators of both parties have done in the past, we do not acquiesce to any provision of Senate rules—adopted by a previous Congress—that would deny the majority that right. 
The resolution I am offering today is 
based on proposals we introduced at the start of the 112th and 113th Con-gresses. At that time, many called our efforts a power grab by the majority. But we were very clear. We would sup-port these changes even if we were in the minority, and here we are today, reintroducing the reform package as Members of the minority. 
These changes do not strip minority 
rights. They allow the body to function as our Founders intended. The heart of our proposal is the talking filibuster. The filibuster once was a tool that was used sparingly. It allowed the minority to be heard. Today it is abused too often and far too easily. 
I have said many times that the Sen-
ate has become a graveyard for good ideas. The shovel is the broken fili-buster and other procedural tactics. 
The system is broken. But in the last 
election I think the message was clear. The electorate said: Fix it, do your job, and make the government work. That is what our resolution is intended to do. 
Our reforms were not adopted in the 
last Congress, but we made some progress. Strong support for fixing the Senate led leaders R
EIDand M CCON-
NELL to address the dysfunction in the 
Senate and make some moderate changes. 
Unfortunately, it did not take long 
for the leaders’ gentlemen’s agreement to break down. In November 2013 the abuse of the rules—and the obstruc-tion—reached a tipping point, and so 
the majority acted within the prece-dence of the Senate. We changed the rules to prevent the minority from abusing the rules and obstructing scores of qualified nominees for judi-cial and executive appointments. 
I believe that drastic step was unfor-
tunate, but it was also necessary. The minority has a right to voice objec-tions but not to abuse the rules to ob-struct justice by preventing judges from being confirmed or by preventing the President from getting his team in place. 
By changing the rules, the 113th Sen-
ate was able to confirm 96 judges. In fact, it confirmed more judges than any modern Congress since 1980. 
The 113th Congress also confirmed 293 
executive nominations in 2014—the most since 2010. 
That is an incredible change. It was a 
bold but necessary action. But it also led to even greater polarization in the Senate. That polarization could have been prevented if the Senate had adopt-ed our reforms at the beginning of the 113th Congress. 
That is why I strongly urge the new 
majority leader to continue the change

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S24 January 6, 2015 
that was adopted in November. It al-
lows most judicial and executive branch appointees to be confirmed by a straight majority vote. I urge him to continue the progress we made last Congress and adopt the rest of our pro-posed reforms at the start of this Con-gress. 
Anyone who has watched this Senate 
try to legislate in the past few years knows we still are hobbled by dysfunc-tion. We voted on cloture 218 times just over the past 2 years. To put that in perspective, the Senate voted on clo-ture only 38 times in the 50 years after the rule was adopted in 1917. We cannot continue down this path. 
The unprecedented use of the fili-
buster and other procedural tactics by both parties has prevented the Senate from getting its work done. The Senate needs to return to its his historical practice and function as a deliberative yet majoritarian body, when filibusters were rare and bipartisanship was the norm. 
We believe the proposed rule changes 
in our resolution provide commonsense reforms. This will restore the best tra-ditions of the Senate and allow it to conduct the business the American people expect. 
We have one goal, whether we are in 
the majority or in the minority: to give the American people the govern-ment they expect and deserve, a gov-ernment that works. 
We said before, and we say it again, 
that we can do this—with respect for the minority, with respect for differing points of view, with respect for this Chamber, but, most of all with respect for the people who send us here. 
The right to change the rules at the 
beginning of a new Congress is sup-ported by history and by the Constitu-tion. Article I, section 5 is very clear. The Senate can adopt and amend its rules at the beginning of the new Con-gress by a simple majority vote. This is known as the constitutional option, and it is well named. 
It has been used numerous times— 
often with bipartisan support—since the cloture provision was adopted in 1917. 
Opponents of the Constitutional Op-
tion say that the rules can only be changed with a two-thirds super-majority, as the current filibuster rule requires. And they have repeatedly said any attempt to amend the rules by a simple majority is ‘‘breaking the rules to change the rules.’’ This simply is not true. 
The supermajority requirement to 
change Senate rules is in direct con-flict with the U.S. Constitution. Arti-cle I Section 5 of the Constitution states that, ‘‘Each House may deter-mine the Rules of its Proceedings, pun-ish its Members for disorderly Behav-ior, and, with the Concurrence of two thirds, expel a Member.’’ When the Framers required a supermajority, they explicitly stated so, as they did for expelling a member. On all other matters, such as determining the chamber’s rules, a majority require-
ment is clearly implied. 
There have been three rulings by 
Vice Presidents, sitting as President of the Senate, on the meaning of Article I Section 5 as it applies to the Senate. In 1957, Vice President Nixon ruled defini-tively: 
[W]hile the rules of the Senate have been 
continued from one Congress to another, the right of a current majority of the Senate at the beginning of a new Congress to adopt its own rules, stemming as it does from the Con-stitution itself, cannot be restricted or lim-ited by rules adopted by a majority of a pre-vious Congress. Any provision of Senate rules adopted in a previous Congress which has the expressed or practical effect of deny-ing the majority of the Senate in a new Con-gress the right to adopt the rules under which it desires to proceed is, in the opinion of the Chair, unconstitutional. 
Vice-Presidents Rockefeller and 
Humphrey made similar rulings at the beginning of later Congresses. 
In 1979, when others were arguing 
that the rules could only be amended in accordance with the previous Sen-ate’s rules, Majority Leader Byrd said the following on the floor: 
There is no higher law, insofar as our Gov-
ernment is concerned, than the Constitution. The Senate rules are subordinate to the Con-stitution of the United States. The Constitu-tion in Article I, Section 5, says that each House shall determine the rules of its pro-ceedings. Now we are at the beginning of Congress. This Congress is not obliged to be bound by the dead hand of the past. 
In addition to the clear language of 
the Constitution, there is also a long-standing common law principle, upheld in the Supreme Court, that one legisla-ture cannot bind its successors. For ex-ample, if the Senate passed a bill with a requirement that it takes 75 votes to repeal it in the future, that would vio-late this principle and be unconstitu-tional. Similarly, the Senate of one Congress cannot adopt procedural rules that a majority of the Senate in the fu-ture cannot amend or repeal. 
Many of my Republican colleagues 
have made the same argument. For ex-ample, in 2003 Senator J
OHN CORNYN  
wrote in a law review article: 
Just as one Congress cannot enact a law 
that a subsequent Congress could not amend by majority vote, one Senate cannot enact a rule that a subsequent Senate could not amend by majority vote. Such power, after all, would violate the general common law principle that one parliament cannot bind another. 
So amending our rules at the begin-
ning of a Congress is not ‘‘breaking the rules to change the rules.’’ It is re-affirming that the U.S. Constitution is superior to the Senate rules, and that when there is a conflict between them, we follow the Constitution. 
And I would like to make clear that 
by moving on to other business, we are not waiving our constitutional right to amend the Senate’s rules with a major-ity vote. In 1975, when the cloture threshold was reduced from two-thirds to three-fifths, the reform effort lasted until March. But on the first day of that Congress, Senator Mondale intro-duced his resolution and unequivocally 
stated that he was reserving his right to call for a majority vote at a later date. 
Senator Mondale made the following 
statement on that first day: 
Mr. President, I wish to state, as has been 
traditional at the commencement of efforts to amend rule XXII, that, by operating under the Standing Rules of the Senate the sup-porters of this resolution do not acquiesce to the applicability of certain of those rules to the effort to amend rule XXII; nor do they waive any rights which they may obtain under the Constitution, the practice of this body, or certain rulings of previous Vice Presidents to amend rule XXII, uninhibited by rules in effect during previous Congresses. 
Today, I take the same position as 
Senator Mondale and many other re-formers did over the years. I under-stand that Majority Leader M
CCONNELL  
may move on to other business, but I am not acquiescing to any provision in the Senate rules that prevents a major-ity from amending those rules. We can, and should, take time to debate our proposal and have an up or down vote. I know other colleagues also have re-form proposals. They all deserve con-sideration. 
This is not just about rules. It is 
about the norms and traditions of the Senate. They have collapsed under the weight of the filibusters. 
Neither side is 100-percent pure. Both 
sides have used the rules for obstruc-tion. No doubt they have had their rea-sons, but I don’t think the American people care about that. They don’t want a history lesson or a lesson in parliamentary procedure. They want a government that is reasonable and that works. 
I hope all my colleagues, especially 
the new Senators, give special consid-eration to reform. We do not need to win every legislative or nomination vote, but we need to have a real de-bate—and an open process—to ensure we are, actually, the greatest delibera-tive body in the world. 
We changed the rule regarding nomi-
nations. That was an important start, but it was the beginning—not the end. We still need to reform the Senate rules. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that Senator F
RANKEN be added as 
a cosponsor to S. Res. 20.

objection, it is so ordered.

advice and consent on nominations, 
and work well in terms of our responsi-bility for legislation that will address the big issues facing our Nation. 
Since I came to the Senate in 2009, it 
has been a pleasure to work with my colleague from New Mexico. My col-league from New Mexico came to the Senate from the House. I came here from the State of Oregon but with memories of how the Senate worked many years before when I first came to the Senate as an intern in 1976. 
I must say, in the 1970s, this body 
worked very much in the manner that one might anticipate. A bill was put forward. There was no filibuster of a motion to proceed. The bill was de-bated. A group of Senators would be ready to call upon the President of the Senate to submit their amendment. 
Whoever was called on first—that 
amendment was debated. That amend-ment was debated, and in a short pe-riod of time it was voted on and then the Senators would vie for the oppor-tunity to present the next amendment. 
What I saw in 2009 when I came back 
as a Senator was a very different Chamber, a Chamber where long peri-ods of time would be spent debating what bills to debate. The motion to proceed would be filibustered. So we would waste the energy of this institu-tion not upon delving into the com-plexities of an issue and how to best address it but simply on the procedural issue of whether we were going to start debate on a particular bill. 
This situation has certainly been ob-
served by the American public. The American public’s esteem for our insti-tution has declined steadily over the past several decades as the paralysis of this institution has increased. 
Observers of Congress report that the 
past two Congresses have been among the least productive in modern his-tory—too few amendments getting con-sidered, paralysis even after a bill has come to the floor on which amendment to address first, and too many filibus-ters—filibusters not of the type of old in which a Senator would delay action on a bill by holding forth as long as his energies would enable him or her to stand on this floor and carry forth, but filibusters of the silent kind, the kind in which there is simply an objection to closing debate. But then this Cham-ber is filled with silence because no one has anything left to say on it, and no one is willing to spend the time and en-ergy to even declare to the American people: I am here on this floor speaking at length because I want to block this bill. There is no accountability to the public in that fashion—no trans-parency. So the silent filibuster has come to haunt this hall. 
Well, that is a very different Senate 
than the Senate in the mid-1970s and one that my colleague from New Mex-ico and I are determined to change—to restore this Chamber to being a great deliberative body. We can have all the interesting policy ideas in the world, and we can have, certainly, insights on how to make things work better, but if 
the machinery for this body to consider those ideas is broken, then, certainly, those abilities are not put into their best opportunity or framework. Many folks, when we have been debating the functionality of the Senate, have said: But, remember, it was George Wash-
ington who said that the Senate should be a cooling saucer—in other words, saying that the dysfunction and paral-ysis of the Senate is just exactly the way it was designed to be. 
That is certainly a misreading of the 
comment attributed, perhaps apoc-ryphally, to George Washington. George Washington was referring to the fact that the Senate was designed with a constitutional framework of 6 years, of one-third of the Members ro-tating every 2 years, of a Chamber that was initially elected indirectly by the States—rather than by popular elec-tion—and that this would give it more chance to be thoughtful and reflective on the issues that come before the Na-tion. 
This thoughtfulness, this ability to 
gain reflexion, is, in fact, exactly what the Senate should be. It is the quality that led to the Senate being described as the world’s greatest deliberative body. But the filibuster, and the abuse of it, has changed that. And certainly 
the inability of the minority and the majority to be able to put forth amend-ments in a timely fashion and to de-bate them has changed. 
I think back to what Alexander Ham-
ilton said early in the history of our Nation. He said that the real operation of the filibuster ‘‘. . . is to embarrass the administration, to destroy the en-ergy of government, to substitute the pleasure, caprice and artifices of an in-significant, turbulent or corrupt junto to the regular deliberations and deci-sions of a respectable majority.’’ 
That phrase, isn’t that what we need 
to restore in this body, the regular de-liberations and decisions of a respect-able majority? 
This is all part of this cycle of a de-
mocracy in which citizens vote for an individual who they feel reflects what needs to be done in our Nation, and those individuals come to this [cham-ber/Chamber] and they proceed to have an agenda. That agenda, if it is part of the majority agenda or a bipartisan majority agenda, gets implemented and those ideas get tested. Those ideas that work well can be kept and those ideas that work poorly can be thrown out. But if this Chamber is locked in paralysis, that cycle of testing ideas and of citizens voting for a vision and seeing that vision implemented and tested is broken. That is much where we are now. 
Alexander Hamilton went on to say 
that when the majority must conform to the views of the minority, the con-sequence is ‘‘ . . . tedious delays; con-tinual negotiation and intrigue; con-temptible compromises of the public good.’’ 
I think that is exactly what we have 
seen too much of in this Chamber, whether it be one party in charge or 
the other party in charge. As my col-league noted, this is not a partisan issue. The ideas we put forward when in the majority we are now putting for-ward in the minority. Isn’t that the test of whether an idea is in fact de-signed for the good of this institution, rather than the advantage of the mo-ment? 
Our Senate is broken. The American 
people know that. And it is our respon-
sibility as Senators to work to change that. That is why there should now be a full debate among the Members on the best ideas on how to enable this Chamber to work better. Those ideas should come from the right of the aisle, from the left of the aisle, and ideas in partnership between colleagues on both sides of the aisle. Again, this shouldn’t be about the advantage of the moment, it should be about the successful func-tion of our beloved Senate. 
One of the things we have seen in the 
course of this broken Senate is our fail-ure to adequately dispose of our re-sponsibility for advice and consent on nominations under the Constitution. That responsibility is designed to be a check on outrageous potential nomina-tions from the President. It is not de-signed to be a way for one coequal branch of government—that is the Con-gress—to seek to systematically under-mine other branches of the govern-ment, be it the judiciary or the execu-tive. So we need to have a timely and systematic way of considering nomina-tions. That certainly has fallen apart in the course of the poisonous and par-tisan nature of deliberations here over the last few years. But we can change that. 
Indeed, we stepped forward a year 
ago November to test a rule to close debate on most nominations with a simple majority. The result has been quite spectacular. The number of dis-trict judges who have been considered on the floor of this Chamber has more than doubled—has almost tripled. Judi-cial vacancies have been cut in half— extremely important to a fair and ca-pable judiciary. Executive nominations roughly doubled. 
It should not be the goal of this 
Chamber, whether the majority or the minority, to disable the executive branch by preventing the positions from being filled in the executive branch. If a majority says a person is reasonable, then that nomination should proceed expeditiously. 
Senator U
DALL and I have put for-
ward, as he noted, a resolution that is in keeping with the package of ideas we worked on in 2011 and 2013, so we are presenting those ideas here in 2015. But my encouragement is for people to put forward their ideas, individual Sen-ators, to add their ideas or put forward individual components that will con-tribute to this dialogue. 
One of the ideas we have, and I will 
be offering to this body, is to create a process to consider rule changes at the start of each legislative session—a de-tailed way of addressing that, since

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S26 January 6, 2015 
currently we have no pattern, no guide, 
to holding a debate about how the Sen-ate functions. 
A second will be to consider the expe-
dited consideration of most nomina-tions. We made a rule change a couple 
of years ago—well, November a year ago. And also, before that, we made some minor changes in timing in Janu-ary 2013. That came out of the debate just 2 years ago. Those January 2013 
changes are expiring. Those timelines are expiring. So that goes away. Should those be adopted as part of the standing rules rather than simply the standing orders which expire with the change of a Congress? 
A third idea is to end the filibuster 
on the motion to proceed to legisla-tion. Think about how this has changed. If you take the 10-year period between 1973 and 1982, a 10-year period that embraces when I first came here as an intern, there were 14 times there was a filibuster on a motion to proceed. If you take 10 years from roughly 2003 to 2012, that number went up to about 160—more than a tenfold increase in the paralysis of getting bills to the floor to be discussed. 
Why should there be filibusters at all 
on a conference committee? If the House has put forward an idea and 
passed it, and the same bill has been passed by the Senate, isn’t it common sense to enable a delegation from each Chamber to meet together to work out a compromise? We did make a modest 
improvement in this procedure, but there is much more work to be done on this. 
In fact, I was mystified when I came 
here in 2009 as to why there weren’t conference committees going on. First I heard: Well, it is easier for Chairs of committees to get together informally and try to work out something behind the scenes. But then, as I asked more questions, the answer became: Because there are three steps required, and all three of which enable a filibuster, and that paralysis just isn’t worth enter-taining the time on the floor. Well, let us restore conference committees. Let us get rid of filibusters on conference committees. 
And certainly we must improve floor 
debate by ensuring amendments can be introduced and debated. The minority has said in recent years that this is a deep disadvantage to them. But I can tell you as a Member of the previous majority that it was a disadvantage to majority Members as well not to be able to introduce and debate amend-
ments. 
We also certainly must replace the 
silent filibuster with the talking fili-buster so there is transparency and ac-countability to the use of this instru-ment on final passage of a bill. 
Let us not let this opportunity pass. 
Let us not continue on autopilot from one Congress to the next. Let us take this moment of opportunity to start on this path to restoring the U.S. Senate to being the world’s greatest delibera-tive body in order to address the big issues before us and for the betterment of our Nation. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

MEMORANDA OF UNDERSTANDING 
BETWEEN THE COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY AND THE COM-MITTEES ON AGRICULTURE, EN-ERGY AND COMMERCE, AND WAYS AND MEANS 
HON. JOHN A. BOEHNER 
OF OHIO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 
Mr. BOEHNER. Mr. Speaker, I submit the 
following memoranda of understanding. 
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING  
On January 6, 2015, the House agreed to H. 
Res. 5, establishing the rules of the House for the 114th Congress. Section 2(a)(2)(A) of H. Res. 5 contained a provision adding ‘‘ crim-inalization’’ to the jurisdictional statement of the Committee on the Judiciary. 
The Committee on the Judiciary and the 
Committee on Agriculture jointly acknowl-edge as the authoritative source of legisla-tive history concerning section 2(a)(2)(A) of H. Res. 5 the description printed in the Con-gressional Record and submitted by Rules Committee Chair Pete Sessions. 
By this memorandum, the committees 
record their further mutual understandings by providing the following example, which will supplement the statement cited above. 
In general, this change is not intended to 
cover measures that make changes to a regu-latory or revenue collection scheme without making changes to the specific conduct that triggers a criminal penalty that is part of the enforcement regime. 
For instance, where a statute prohibits un-
authorized movement of certain prohibited plants or animals without the proper permit and imposes a criminal sanction for a viola-tion of the permit, a measure which simply makes changes to the permitting process would not fall within the scope of this rules change, even in the case where a criminal penalty applies broadly to the statute in question. It is the conduct of moving the prohibited item, not the permitting process, which gives rise to the Committee on the Ju-diciary’s jurisdictional interest. 
This example is intended to be merely il-
lustrative rather than exclusive or exhaus-tive. Nothing in this memorandum precludes a further agreement between the committees with regard to the implementation of this provision.

It is the conduct of discharging the pollutant, not the identifica-tion of the pollutant, which gives rise to the Committee on the Judiciary’s jurisdictional interest.

It is the conduct of evading taxes or tariffs, not the imposition or calculation of the tax or tariff itself, which gives rise to the Committee on the Ju-diciary’s jurisdictional interest.

RECOGNIZING TENNANT TRUCK 
LINES FOR ITS PARTICIPATION IN WREATHS ACROSS AMERICA 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the work of Tennant Truck Lines of Colona, Illinois. For the last five years, Tennant Truck Lines has participated in the Wreaths Across America program, which hon-ors veterans by coordinating wreath laying ceremonies throughout all 50 states. 
I had the honor of participating in the 
Wreaths Across America ceremony on De-cember 13, 2014, at the Rock Island National Cemetery, in my home district in Illinois. This was the 10th Wreaths Across America cere-mony held at the Cemetery, one of thousands of ceremonies held across the nation. 
Tennant Truck Lines played a vital role in 
transporting wreaths, volunteering their trucks and manpower to move 3,072 wreaths to over 900 veteran ceremonies by December 13. Two trucks from Tennant Truck Lines drove all the way to Arlington National Cemetery, and many more played a vital role in transporting wreaths within the Midwest as they traveled from Maine to California. 
Mr. Speaker, I am extremely proud of the 
work Tennant Truck Lines and CEO Aaron Tennant have done to remember and honor the veterans who bravely served our country. It is my honor to recognize them today.

‘‘TAX CODE TERMINATION ACT’’ 
HON. BOB GOODLATTE 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 
Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to re-introduce the ‘‘Tax Code Termination Act,’’ legislation that will abolish the Internal Revenue Code by December 31, 2019, and call on Congress to approve a new Federal tax system by July of the same year. 
There is no denying that our current tax sys-
tem has spiraled out of control. Americans de-vote countless hours each year to comply with the tax code and it is very clear we need tax simplification. Today’s tax code is unfair, dis-courages savings and investment, and is im-possibly complex. Businesses and families need relief from uncertainty and the burden-some task of complying with the tax code. However, the problem is Congress won’t act on fundamental tax reform unless it is com-pelled to do so. The Tax Code Termination

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E2 January 6, 2015 
Act will finally force Congress to debate and 
address fundamental tax reform. 
Once the Tax Code Termination Act be-
comes law, today’s oppressive tax code would survive for only four more years, at which time it would expire and be replaced with a new tax code that will be determined by Congress, the President, and the American people. The Tax Code Termination Act will allow us, as a na-tion, to collectively decide what the new tax system should look like. Having a date-certain to end the current tax code will force the issue to the top of the national agenda, where it will remain until Congress finishes writing the new tax law. 
This legislation has gained wide support in 
past Congresses and had 122 bipartisan co-sponsors in the 113th Congress. In fact, simi-lar legislation has already been passed twice by the House of Representatives, first in 1998 and then in 2000. 
Although many questions remain about the 
best way to reform our tax system, if Con-gress is forced to address the issue we can create a tax code that is simpler, fairer, and better for our economy than the one we are forced to comply with today. Congress won’t reach a consensus on such a contentious issue unless it is forced to do so. The Tax Code Termination Act will force Congress to fi-nally debate and address fundamental tax re-form. 
America’s future partially depends on over-
coming the impairment that is our current tax code. There is a widespread consensus that the current system is broken, and keeping it is not in America’s best interest. I urge my col-leagues to support this legislation and end the broken tax system that exists today and pro-vide a tax code that the American people de-serve.

STOPPING ABUSIVE STUDENT 
LOAN COLLECTION PRACTICES IN BANKRUPTCY ACT OF 2015 
HON. JOHN CONYERS, JR. 
OF MICHIGAN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 
Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, the ‘‘Stopping 
Abusive Student Loan Collection Practices in Bankruptcy Act of 2015’’ targets ruthless col-lection tactics employed by some student loan creditors against debtors who have sought bankruptcy relief, as documented by the New York Times in its cover story last year. 
Specifically, my legislation bill would em-
power a bankruptcy judge to award costs and reasonable attorney’s fees to a debtor who successfully obtained the discharge of his or her liability for a student loan debt based on undue hardship if: (1) the creditor’s position was not substantially justified, and (2) there are no special circumstances that would make such award unjust. The Bankruptcy Code al-ready grants identical authority to a bank-ruptcy judge to award costs and reasonable attorney’s fees to debtor where a creditor re-quests the determination of dischargeability of a consumer debt based on the allegation that it was fraudulently incurred and the court thereafter finds that the creditor’s position was not substantially justified and there are no special circumstances that would make such award unjust. Although parties typically do and should pay 
their own attorney’s fees in litigation, dischargeability determinations concerning stu-dent loan debts present compelling factors that warrant the relief provided by this legisla-tion. Under current bankruptcy law, debtors must meet a very high burden of proof, name-ly, that repayment of the student loan debt will present an undue hardship on the debtor and the debtor’s dependents. The litigation typi-cally requires extensive discovery, trial-like procedures, and legal analysis. 
Unfortunately, some student loan debt col-
lectors engage in abusive litigation tactics that exponentially drive up the potential cost of legal representation for a debtor. As a result, debtors, who may legally qualify for the Bank-ruptcy Code’s undue hardship dischargeability exception for student loans, may be unable to obtain such relief because of the potential risk of excessive and unaffordable legal fees that the debtor may have to incur not only to meet the high standard of proof, but also to combat an abusive litigation stance taken by a well- funded adversary. 
The ‘‘Stopping Abusive Student Loan Col-
lection Practices in Bankruptcy Act of 2015’’ will help level the playing field for debtors overwhelmed by student loan debts, the re-payment of which would present an undue hardship for themselves and their families. It is my hope that should this measure become law, bankruptcy judges will not hesitate to award debtors attorney’s fees in appropriate cases of abusive litigation engaged in by stu-dent loan creditors.

GOVERNOR JAMES B. EDWARDS 
SERVICE 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speak-
er, at the Service of Worship Celebrating the Life of James Burrows Edwards at historic St. Philip Episcopal Church of Charleston (Amer-ican statesman John C. Calhoun is buried in the St. Philips Churchyard), his beloved son- in-law Kenneth B. Wingate, Sr., Esq. delivered the following Reflections. 
REFLECTIONS  
I’m Jim’s son-in-law, and I want to reflect 
on the life of James Burrows Edwards, the Charming Captain of our Ship. 
Jim Edwards was a great man, by any pos-
sible measure. Webster defines ‘‘great’’ as eminent or excellent. Jim accomplished more in a lifetime than any other 10 people combined. He served the nation in the Mer-chant Marines as a 17 year-old during World War II, crossing the Atlantic 11 times, car-rying equipment and supplies to England, France and Germany, and returning each time with wounded American soldiers. By the end of the war, Jim had ascended in rank from dishwasher to able-bodied seaman to quartermaster. He studied hard while off duty, and ultimately earned his third-mate’s license which authorized him to guide ships ‘‘of any tonnage, on any waters of the world.’’ And guide ships he did, all of his life. 
Jim paid his way through the College of 
Charleston, working summer jobs such as transporting general cargo to ports of call around Europe, South America, and the Car-ibbean. Not your typical undergraduate stu-dent at the College, was he, President 
McConnell? 
Jim married his childhood sweetheart, Ann 
Darlington, in 1951, though not everyone in her family could see the potential in this young man. Ann’s step-grandmother, ‘‘Gran’’ was at home shortly before their wedding. Jim dropped by and asked Gran what she thought of all this commotion. She replied, ‘‘I guess it’s okay, but Ann sure could do bet-ter than that little boy from Rifle Range Road!’’ Jim said, ‘‘I think so, too.’’ 
Jim and Ann worked their way through 
dental school at the University of Louisville. Ann worked for the Red Cross in the hills of Kentucky as a nurse, while Jim ran for and was elected president of the student body in his spare time. These early ventures honed his impressive personal skills, teaching him how to break down barriers, build rapport, pull together a team. Jim also worked odd jobs, such as selling mint juleps at the Ken-tucky Derby. One year at the Derby, while selling concessions, Jim bet $6 on Dark Star, a long-shot at odds of 25–1, simply because the horse had trained in South Carolina. Dark Star won the race, and Jim took home a fat purse, and a lesson on long-shot vic-tories. 
I don’t intend to drag you through each of 
his fascinating and successful careers in oral surgery, in state politics, in serving on President Reagan’s cabinet as Secretary of Energy, and then returning to the Medical University of South Carolina for 17 years as president. You were all there with him and with Ann, his forever first lady, at every memorable and enjoyable step of the way. 
Not only was Jim a great man, but far 
more importantly he was a good man. The Bible only refers to two people, Barnabas and Joseph of Arimethea, as ‘‘good.’’ The biblical definition of good is generous, with a willing-ness to put other’s interests above one’s own. It’s rare to find a great man; it is more rare to find a good man. But it is exceedingly rare to find a great man who is good. 
Jim had three specific qualities that en-
deared him to us all: 
First was his HUMOR; that quick wit, 
often self-deprecating, never vulgar. He loved to tell the true story of being in the hardware store in Moncks Corner, wearing his old hunting clothes, when a woman going up and down the aisles kept staring at him. Finally, she came over and said, ‘‘Has any-one ever told you you look like Jim Edwards?’’. He said, yes, and before he could say anything else, she said, ‘‘Makes you mad as hops, doesn’t it?’’ 
Even the name of O’ Be Joyful, his mag-
nificent home overlooking Charleston harbor is a whimsical, double-entendre. Yes, it’s in-tended to reflect the biblical encouragement to live each moment joyfully. But it’s also a reminder of how Jim and Ann got the house. A widow, Kathryn McNulta, owned the home but was reluctant to sell it. Periodically Jim and Ann would go sit with her on the piazza, and she would offer them a drink called an O’ Be Joyful—a can of limeade, a can of light rum, a can of dark rum, and the white of an egg. Ann would look at Jim quietly and say, ‘‘I can’t drink that!’’ And he said, ‘‘You will if you want the house!’’ 
Jim’s second endearing quality was his 
HUMANITY; he had a genuine concern for the well-being of others. He always looked for the best in people, but cast a patient and sympathetic eye when they fell short. His care for others could be seen in his lifelong commitment to improvements in healthcare and in education. One of the landmark pieces of legislation while he was governor was the Education Finance Act, which altered the way funds were distributed to schools across South Carolina. And of course his thirty

years of service as president and then presi-
dent emeritus of his beloved Medical Univer-sity. He continued fundraising for MUSC lit-erally to the end of his life. After his stroke in 2013, when he could no longer take poten-tial donors out to restaurants, he and Ann would entertain them at home. As recently as three weeks ago, he attended the ribbon- cutting ceremony for the refurbished College of Nursing. 
Jim’s humanity could be seen in his leg-
endary generosity, as well as his friendliness and hospitality to all. He never met a stranger, never turned down a request for help, and never let race or creed or party af-filiation color his love for people. Though he held his Republican ideals closely, he em-braced everyone across the aisle. He loved and served with Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, and Strom Thurmond, but he also loved and served with Bob McNair, Rembert Dennis, and Fritz Hollings. He was always collegial, always the statesman. 
Finally, Jim will be remembered for his 
HUMILITY. He never let success go to his head. Though he had many titles (third mate, lieutenant commander, doctor, chair-man, senator, governor, secretary, presi-dent—in fact, he often joked he couldn’t keep a steady job) his favorite title was just plain Jim. His beautiful Limerick Plantation was simply ‘‘the farm.’’ His favorite vehicle was always his old truck, which always had a few dents. Though he walked with kings and presidents, and sat with captains of in-dustry and commerce, he never forgot his roots on Rifle Range Road. He often quipped that when you leave office, you go from ‘‘who’s who’’ to ‘‘who’s he?’’ very quickly. He was never pretentious. 
I guess in a word, Jim was a Renaissance 
man—he could do anything, and do it well. He could repair engines, recite poetry, build furniture, design jewelry, grow luscious vegetables and flowers, win elections, shoot the lights out with a shotgun, navigate by the stars, negotiate a deal, close a sale, cast a vision and recruit a team to transform an institution or a party or a state. And he could make his grandchildren laugh. His ‘‘joi de vie’’ was contagious, and he infected all of us with his charm. 
A few months ago, sitting in O’ Be Joyful 
at the magnificent table he built with his own hands, Jim and I talked about what I should say to you today. First he asked me to exhort you in your faith. Jim first placed his trust in Jesus Christ at age 5, sitting on the knee of his grandfather, Joseph Hooker Hieronymus, an itinerant Methodist min-ister in the hills of eastern Kentucky. Jim always treasured this little Bible given to him by his grandfather at that time, and had this tucked inside a larger Bible when he was sworn in as governor. After Jim’s stroke last year, we spent many evenings as a family reading and discussing the parables of Jesus, how we enter, grow, live and finish in the kingdom of God. And finish in faith Jim has done. 
Second, he asked me to encourage you, es-
pecially Ann, and Jim, and Cathy, and you grandchildren, not to grieve as others do who have no hope. For we believe that Jesus died and rose again, and even so will return one day and will bring with him those who have fallen asleep, and that we will always be to-gether with them who trust Christ and loved his coming. We declare this by the word of the Lord. May it be so, for each of us today. 
The Sermon was lovingly delivered by the 
Right Reverend Dr. C. Fitz Simons Allison. 
SERMON  
Rarely have I had such an encouraging ex-
perience as helping to plan this funeral serv-ice with the family of Jim Edwards. They knew exactly what they and Jim wanted. They knew because their Christian faith was 
continually expressed within their family and at family gatherings. If you want to know what Jim Edwards believed, examine carefully this funeral service. The psalms, hymns, lessons, and prayers, The Old Rugged Cross truly express his faith. They told me right away that Jim’s favorite biblical text was Micah 6:6–8. 
‘‘And what does the Lord require of you 
but to do justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God.’’ 
‘‘Doing justly’’ is enormously difficult. In 
medicine, when a life is at stake, justice does not allow ineptness, incompetence, careless-ness, or sloth. Instead discipline, rigor, warn-ings, and possibly terminations are needed. Surely Jim had to face such decisions con-tinually in his public life. 
Loving mercy seemed to come easily to 
Jim and many of us have experienced his en-couragement that we did not deserve. Mercy is at the heart of all graceful relationships, but inappropriate mercy can lead to ineffi-ciency, poor performance, and senti-mentality. Sentimentality is long range cru-elty. Good bedside manners are desirable but not at the expense of knowledge and rigorous training. I am sure that Jim faced uncertain and complex issues of mercy. Doing justly and loving mercy can be very difficult and frustrating. 
Walking humbly with God is a key to deal-
ing with decisions of justice and mercy, not unlike issues we all face daily. Walking hum-bly with God is an acknowledgement that our truth is only partial and inadequate. Only God’s truth is perfect. My physician fa-ther used to say, ‘‘Deliver me from people who are certain they are right.’’ Walking humbly with God as expressed by Abraham Lincoln, ‘‘with malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in the right, as God gives us to see that right.’’ 
The humility that is required for the deci-
sions of justice and mercy is clearly ex-pressed by the phrase ‘‘as God gives us to see the right.’’ Jim certainly faced many frus-trations and difficulties in his leadership. I remember General James Grimsley, when he was President of the Citadel, asking Jim what was the difference between his experi-ence in professional politics and that of aca-demic politics. Jim’s answer was that profes-sional politics was Sunday school sin; aca-demic politics was graduate school sin.’’ 
Jim’s humor was an essential part of his 
humility. He could laugh at frustration and laugh at himself. He knew something of Christopher Frey’s wisdom: ‘‘Comedy is an escape, escape not from truth, but from de-spair, a narrow escape into faith.’’ Walking humbly with God enables us to see the laughableness of human pretension and the joy of knowing and trusting in the benevo-lent truth beyond ourselves, in God’s truth. If I think my opinion is absolute with no higher truth over it, my truth becomes my God. My opinions become dogmas. If I am a doctor there is no check on my view short of the morgue. Or in the case of politics, with-out humility, we will have stagnation, chaos, or tyranny. 
Jim and Ann, the two names come natu-
rally together after 63 years of marriage. A trained nurse and childhood sweetheart, she became a partner in all activities whether politics, administration, fund raising, enter-tainment, or whatever needed attention. But above all she shares his faith. 
Recently Martha and I had lunch with 
them. Jim’s concern for the health and mo-rality of our society was uppermost on his mind. He seemed to sense that absence of hu-mility in these times, and the lack the of ‘‘walking with God,’’ the underpining of our society. The result being society’s unbecom-ing commitment to certainties, about what is really uncertain, and uncertain about 
what is really certain. 
Cathy and Ken told me that he knew that 
his favorite text from Micah ‘‘do justly, love mercy, and walk humbly with your God’’ was an ideal that needs the gospel to make it ef-fective. ‘‘I am the way the truth and the light.’’ This text is only understood when one realizes that the Christian God is per-fect, and we are not. We cannot as sinners stand in his presence. And ‘‘no one comes to the father except by me’’ is not meant to be discourteous to other religions but to ex-press the Christian commitment to the ma-jestic perfection of God. Only by God’s word, his only begotten Son, can a Christian stand in his presence. 
Our problems were diagnosed years ago by 
J. B. Philips in his very short book, Your God is Too Small. Jim’s God was not a small God but a God before whom we are all sin-ners. As a sinner himself Jim could have compassion for other sinners and knowing he was a forgiven sinner his life could be lived with compassion for others. This produced the charm and diplomacy so well and widely described in our newspapers. 
But the journalists failed to mention that 
his extraordinary gifts, love and consider-ation for others, were rooted in his realiza-tion that he was a forgiven sinner. It nur-tured and influenced all his commendable ac-tivities. 
Psalm 103, the family’s choice, was the 
fruit of their family devotions in which they recited the Psalm antiphonally. They knew it by heart: ‘‘He has not dealt with us ac-cording to our sins, nor punished us accord-ing to our iniquities.’’ This verse can help us walk humbly with our God. 
The Gospel also makes it abundantly clear 
that Christ has gone to prepare a place for us. Where our goodness falls short, his good-ness stands in our stead. The secular dogma, that this world is all there is ism, in Reinhold Niehuher’s phrase, leaves us bereft of true hope. 
The secular hope is that nature is no 
longer creation revealing the awesome maj-esty of God but a mere object of random chance without design or purpose. One of the most accomplished and attractive leaders of secular belief is the psychiatrist, Allen Wheelis. In his later years he is now unpersuaded by his earlier attempts to make death a meaningful conclusion rather than a fated inescapable and meaningless end. He now protests: ‘‘A symphony has a climax, a poem builds to a burst of meaning but we are unfinished usiness. No coming together of strands. The game is called because of dark-ness.’’ The seculaar hope ends with the dark oblivion of death. This is the unacknowledged cry of the world for a deeper and meaningful hope.

restaurants around our state for being beloved 
destinations for both visitors and locals alike. Lagomarcino’s earned this honor because of its long-standing customer services and tasty treats that attract visitors from all over the globe. 
Lagomarcino’s, a beloved ice cream parlor 
in downtown Moline, is famous for its hot fudge sundaes, sponge candy, filled chocolate eggs, and hand-dipped cones. The turn-of-the- century parlor features mahogany booths cus-tom built by Moline Furniture Works, Tiffany lamps designed in New York, and the terrazzo floor was installed by Cassini Tile of Rock Is-land. In 1997, Lagomarcino’s expanded and opened a second location in the Village of East Davenport, Iowa, and fans from all over the world can order delectable treats online. 
Angelo Lagomarcino, an immigrant from 
Italy, opened Lagomarcino’s Confectionery in Moline in 1908 after obtaining a secret recipe for hot fudge sauce from a traveling salesman in the early 1900s. Against his wife’s wishes, he paid $25 dollars for that recipe—a price that clearly paid off for the restaurant’s many, many fans. That same recipe is used today and Lagomarcino’s sauce has earned national and international recognition from food editors and culinary magazines. 
Mr. Speaker, I again want to congratulate 
Lagomarcino’s for achieving this honored dis-tinction and wish them even more success in the future.

IN RECOGNITION OF BOB MERWIN 
HON. JACKIE SPEIER 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 
Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor 
Bob Merwin, the Chief Executive Officer of Mills-Peninsula Health Services, who is retiring after a remarkable 27-year-career there and a lifelong career in health care. Bob knew early on that hospital administration would be his fu-ture and his passion. 
Under his leadership for almost three dec-
ades Bob proved what he often said—that he is not afraid of change. He led Mills-Peninsula through major changes and transitions and is leaving it prepared for a long and strong fu-ture. 
Bob came to Mills-Peninsula in 1987 as the 
Executive Vice President, rose to Chief Oper-ating Officer and then in 1991 to CEO. One of his biggest and most recent accomplishments was the building and opening of the state-of- the-art Mills-Peninsula Medical Center in 2011. The 241-bed, 450,000 square foot hospital features private rooms with 21st century pa-tient life technology, electronic charting and online capabilities that allow for efficient com-munication, family sleeping accommodations, advanced earthquake technology designed to 
withstand an 8.5 quake, and a top-notch emergency department. It also has its own chef preparing sustainably and locally grown food for patients, staff and for special events for the public. 
Looking at the 241-bed hospital today, it is 
humbling to remember its beginnings. Found-ed by Elizabeth Mills Reid, the Church of St. Matthew Red Cross Guild opened in San Mateo in 1908 with just six beds. It was later renamed Mills Memorial Hospital. Due to sig-nificant growth during the following decades, Peninsula Hospital opened in 1954 in Bur-lingame. In 1985, Mills and Peninsula merged into Mills-Peninsula Health Services. Bob oversaw the integration of both hospitals. He was also at the helm for the next large merger with Sutter Health System in 1996 striving to further strengthening the system of care. 
Under Bob’s leadership, Mills-Peninsula de-
veloped and opened the first community hos-pital Breast Center with advanced diagnostic technologies, the Mack E. Mickelson Arthritis Center, the Family Birth Center, the Dorothy E. Schneider Cancer Center, the Women’s Center, and a Behavioral Health facility. Dur-ing the years leading up to national health re-form, Bob kept his optimism and focus on building an organization that cares for its com-munity. 
In his career and in life, Bob has had a 
strong partner equally committed to health care. He married to Jean Merwin, a nurse for Sutter Care at Home, in 1999. The two first met in the early 70s when they both worked at Long Beach Community Hospital. Bob went on to earn his Master’s Degree in Hospital Ad-ministration from UCLA and become the Sen-ior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer at Pacific Presbyterian Medical Center in San Francisco. Jean moved to the Mendocino Coast and worked as an administrator for a non-profit clinic. Nearly 20 years later, Bob and Jean re-connected at a conference on the Mendocino Coast. Between the two of them they have three children, two grandchildren and one great-grandchild. 
In their well-deserved retirement, Bob and 
Jean are looking forward to spending more time with family and pursue their common passion for golf. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask the House of Represent-
atives to rise with me to honor Bob Merwin for his remarkable career and dedication to health care. He has built Mills-Peninsula Health Serv-ices into an organization that will serve pa-tients, provide jobs and advance our health care system for decades to come.

PREVENTING TERMINATION OF 
UTILITY SERVICES IN BANK-RUPTCY ACT OF 2015 
HON. JOHN CONYERS, JR. 
OF MICHIGAN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 
Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, utility compa-
nies provide many basic and life-saving serv-ices, such as electricity to light our homes, water to drink, and gas to heat our homes. Sometimes, however, individuals, through no fault of their own, struggle to pay for these services often in the face of devastating med-ical debt, job loss, or economic disruption 
VerDate Sep 11 2014 09:37 Jan 07, 2015 Jkt 049060 PO 00000 Frm 00004 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 9920 E:\CR\FM\K06JA8.002 E06JAPT1emcdonald on DSK67QTVN1PROD with REMARKS

caused by divorce. While resorting to bank-
ruptcy provides some relief from financial dis-tress, current law permits utility companies to force these debtors to pay security deposits for continued service even if they were current on their bills before filing for bankruptcy or if they promise to be current on their bills after bankruptcy. Utility companies typically insist that debtors pay at least two months or more of their average bills as a deposit—in addition to requiring that they remain current on their utility bills after bankruptcy—in exchange for the utility continuing to supply service. 
The ‘‘Preventing Termination of Utility Serv-
ice in Bankruptcy Act of 2015’’ corrects this in-justice. It provides that if the debtor remains current on his or her utility bills after filing for bankruptcy relief, the debtor should not have to pay a deposit to the utility to continue serv-ice. 
In Detroit, for example, families across the 
city have seen their water rates increase by 119% over the past decade. During the same period, the Nation generally and Detroit in par-ticular suffered in the aftermath of a global fi-nancial crisis that left one-in-five local resi-dences in foreclosure and sent local unem-ployment rates skyrocketing. 
Fortunately, we are incrementally recovering 
from the Great Recession of 2008. For those individuals who must seek bankruptcy relief, however, we should ensure that their ability to pay their utility bills going forward is not hin-dered by unnecessary demands for deposits if these debtors remain current on their pay-ments to these companies. 
Terminating a family’s access to such life- 
saving services that keeps the lights on, warms our homes, and ensures that they can bathe, hydrate, and prepare meals is simply wrong if these utility bills are being paid on time. 
This legislation is part of a range of solu-
tions that are needed to address the still per-vasive adverse impacts of the Great Reces-sion of 2008. I continue to work with my col-leagues in Congress, state and federal offi-cials, and my constituents to defend the right to water and protect public health. I will not tolerate the notion that—in the 21st Century, in the wealthiest nation on earth—families should go without access to affordable public water and sanitation services.

COMMEMORATING THE CLOSING 
OF THE ICE CREAM PALACE IN SILVIS, ILLINOIS AFTER 50 YEARS IN BUSINESS 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the Ice Cream Palace in Silvis, Illi-nois, owned by Mr. Umberto ‘‘Red’’ Ponce, which closed on December 27th after 50 years of business and service to our community. 
The Ice Cream Palace has been a staple for 
the community of Silvis for the past five dec-ades. Despite its name, Ice Cream Palace is known for serving favorite traditional Mexican cuisine dishes like the popular carne-de-res burritos since 1965. The dishes served come from authentic recipes from Mr. Ponce’s moth-er, Celia Ponce, who was initially a partner in the business and worked there for the res-
taurants’ first 25 years. 
Locals who began frequenting the res-
taurant as children now bring their own fami-lies to enjoy both the food and the close-knit relationships between staff and regulars. Some can even remember the days that the Ice Cream Palace served up chilly treats and say that the great tasting food has not changed a bit over 50 years thanks to Mr. Ponce’s loyalty to his mother’s original rec-ipes. Locals young and old alike have all ex-pressed sadness for the end of such a long- lasting part of their community. Mr. Ponce is looking forward to spending more time with his children and grandchildren during his retire-ment and says he will miss the friends he has made over the years in his staff and cus-tomers. 
Mr. Speaker, I again want to recognize the 
Ice Cream Palace, and am glad that places like this exist, helping to create traditions and bonds within our communities and families.

APPRECIATION OF GOVERNOR 
JAMES B. EDWARDS 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speak-
er, the State newspaper of Columbia, South Carolina, on December 27, 2014, published an article of statements issued upon learning of Governor Edwards’ death.

EDWARDS  
A COLLECTION OF REMARKS AND REMEM -
BRANCES ABOUT FORMER S .C. GOV. JAMES  
EDWARDS , WHO PASSED AWAY FRIDAY AT AGE  
87: 
Glenn McConnell, president of College of 
Charleston and former S.C. Senate president pro tempore: ‘‘As an alumnus of our institu-tion, Gov. Edwards represents the best traits of a College of Charleston education: leader-ship and a passion for lifelong learning. On a personal note, Gov. Edwards was a mentor and a dear friend to me. He helped launch my career in public service and inspired me, through his tireless and selfless efforts, on how to best serve the people of South Caro-lina. In every facet of his life, he believed in making things better for others.’’ 
U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R–Seneca: ‘‘He 
was truly one of the most decent men to have ever served as governor of South Caro-lina. He was a pioneer for the Republican Party and continued to stay involved in party building activities throughout his life.’’ 
U.S. Sen. Tim Scott, R–North Charleston: 
‘‘Jim was an early mentor of mine as I en-tered public service, and I am forever thank-ful for his advice and encouragement. From the dedication of Patriot’s Point during his time as governor to his efforts expanding MUSC while serving as president, Gov. Edwards has left an important legacy in our state.’’ 
U.S. Rep. Joe Wilson, R–Springdale: ‘‘Dr. 
Edwards was a tireless stalwart for conserv-ative limited government to expand freedom. In high school, I would visit his dental office for Goldwater materials, in his capacity as Charleston County Republican Chairman. . . . Dr. Edwards’ vision of an inclusive Re-publican Party came to fulfillment this month with the U.S. Senate victory in Lou-isiana, from his start with no elected state-
wide Republican officials in the five-state Deep South, and now all statewide officials are Republicans.’’ 
Medical University of South Carolina 
President David Cole: ‘‘With his leadership and vision MUSC started to transform and grow in scope, scale, and quality. As an indi-vidual he was universally liked and re-spected—he had a personality that filled the room—truly he never met anyone that he did not like. I had the privilege of joining the faculty as an assistant professor of surgery in 1994, and from day one he made me feel re-spected, included, and at times like I quite possibly was his long lost younger brother.’’ 
S.C. Senate President Pro Tempore Hugh 
Leatherman, R-Florence: ‘‘A Palmetto gen-tleman who sought only the best solutions for his community, state, and nation. I know that the entire Senate of South Carolina joins me in sending our deepest condolences to the Edwards family. The Medical Univer-sity of South Carolina, South Carolina, and the United States are a better place because of his leadership.’’ 
S.C. Republican Party Chairman Matt 
Moore: ‘‘Gov. Edwards made an incredible mark on South Carolina history. His legacy will live on through the countless lives he touched as governor, dentist and particu-larly as a man of faith.’’ 
Former congressman and federal judge 
John Napier: ‘‘Jim Edwards was a giant force for good in everything he ever did. A mentor and creator of the modern Republican Party. Pam and I express our deepest sympathy to Anne and the family.’’ 
Rusty DePass, campaign manager of 
Edwards’ 1974 gubernatorial win: ‘‘He was laid back, easygoing. He was opinionated, but he did not have a hard edge to him and didn’t have a mean bone in his body. And he was the same person in private as he was in public.’’

IN RECOGNITION OF ROBERT ROSS 
HON. JACKIE SPEIER 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 
Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor 
Robert Ross, a successful business owner, exceptional law enforcement officer and dedi-cated public servant who is retiring from the San Mateo City Council after five years of service. He was the Mayor in 2014 and Dep-uty Mayor in 2013. Robert is a genuine, hard- working and deeply committed city council member and will truly be missed. 
Robert was first elected to the council in 
2009 after a 27-year-career as a police officer in San Mateo. His experience in law enforce-ment made security and sustainability one of his priorities for the city. As a real estate agent for 25 years, Robert also brought substantial business experience to the Council, guiding the city toward financial stability. 
While on the Council, Robert served on the 
City Council Audit and Budget Committee, the City Council Legislative Committee, the Com-munity Development Department Audit Com-mittee, the Grand Boulevard Task Force, the North B Street Improvement Initiative and the Planning Commission. In addition, he was very active in the Association of Bay Area Governments, the League of California Cities, San Mateo County Council of Cities, the San Mateo-Foster City Elementary School Board, the San Mateo Oversight Board, the San

Mateo Union High School District Board, the 
Sister City Association and the South Bayside Waste Management Authority. 
Robert received his Police Officers Standard 
& Training at the Modesto College Police Academy and his BSBA in Business Adminis-tration from the University of Phoenix. He started his law enforcement career as a police officer in Hayward in 1979 and transferred to the San Mateo Police Department in 1981 where he rose through the ranks to Police Lieutenant in 2003. His professionalism and proactive approach have been recognized and he has been commended on numerous occa-sions. For example, in the late 1980s, then Corporal Ross was in charge of setting up a task force to fight drug crimes in San Mateo. The group became known as ‘‘Ross’ Raiders’’ and their effective anti-drug campaign was lauded by the City Council, San Mateo County Board of Supervisors, the District Attorney, the San Mateo County Trial Lawyers Association and the late Congressman Tom Lantos. 
Among the many awards Robert received 
was a Lieutenant’s Commendation for proactive policing, the San Carlos/Belmont Ex-change Club Officer of the Year Award, Em-ployee of the Quarter by past Police Chief Don Phipps for ongoing leadership and proactive policing, the Trial Lawyers Associa-tion’s Police Officer of the Year Award, the Peninsula Lions Club’s Police Award for out-standing service to the community, the Gordon Joinville Special Merit Award for day-to-day excellence in policing, and the Medal of Honor, the Police Department’s highest award for saving a life during a fire. 
Whether in his capacity as a city council 
member, a peace officer, a small business owner or a San Mateo resident, Robert has al-ways seized opportunities to help his commu-nity. He has given countless presentations at our schools to help troubled and underprivi-leged youths find a positive direction in their lives. He has visited homes of at-risk youth gang members during the holidays handing out presents. He has worked with the Penin-sula Conflict Resolution Center and the Tongan Interfaith Council to prevent and solve conflicts. He has worked with Samaritan House to assist needy families. He is a mem-ber of the San Mateo Lion’s Club which sup-ports local and international charities. 
It is obvious from this long list of accom-
plishments and engagements that Robert Ross has a heart of gold and an inexhaustible drive to help others. Because of his vision and commitment, San Mateo is a better place. I feel privileged to count Robert as a friend and colleague and wish him well as he shifts his focus to his personal and family life. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask the House of Represent-
atives to rise with me to recognize the lasting contributions Robert Ross has made while serving as Mayor, City Councilmember and law enforcement officer. He will always be a role model and inspiration to his fellow San Mateo residents.

THE HOME FORECLOSURE 
REDUCTION ACT OF 2015 
HON. JOHN CONYERS, JR. 
OF MICHIGAN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 
Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I submit the 
following: SUMMARY  
The ‘‘Home Foreclosure Reduction Act of 
2015’’ would permit a bankruptcy judge, with respect to certain home mortgages, to reduce the principal amount of such mortgages to the fair market value of the homes securing such indebtedness. My legislation will en-courage homeowners to make their mortgage payments and help stem the endless cycle of foreclosures that further depresses home val-ues. It also would authorize the mortgage’s repayment period to be extended so that monthly mortgage payments are more af-fordable. In addition, the bill would allow ex-orbitant mortgage interest rates to be re-duced to a level that will keep the mortgage affordable over the long-term. And, it would authorize the waiver of prepayment pen-alties and excessive fees. Further, the bill would eliminate hidden fees and unauthor-ized costs. 
This bill addresses a fundamental problem: 
homeowners in financial distress simply lack the leverage to make mortgage lenders and servicers engage in meaningful settlement negotiations, even when in the interest of all parties. My legislation would empower a homeowner, under certain circumstances, to force his or her lender to modify the terms of 
the mortgage by allowing the principal amount of the mortgage to be reduced to the home’s fair market value. And, the imple-mentation of this measure will not cost tax-payers a single penny . 
The ‘‘Home Foreclosure Reduction Act of 
2015’’ is identical to H.R. 101 (introduced in the 113th Congress) and H.R. 1587 (introduced in the 112th Congress). It contains similar provisions included in H.R. 1106, which the House passed nearly six years ago. Unfortu-nately, those provisions were removed in the Senate and not included in the final version of the bill that was subsequently enacted into law. 
SECTION -BY-SECTION EXPLANATION OF  
PROVISIONS  
Section 1. Short Title . Section 1 sets forth 
the short title of this Act as the ‘‘Home Foreclosure Reduction Act of 2015.’’ 
Section 2. Definition. Bankruptcy Code sec-
tion 101 defines various terms. Section 2 amends this provision to add a definition of ‘‘qualified loan modification,’’ which is de-fined as a loan modification agreement made in accordance with the guidelines of the Obama Administration’s Homeowner Afford-ability and Stability Plan, as implemented on March 4, 2009 with respect to a loan se-cured by a senior security interest in the debtor’s principal residence. To qualify as such, the agreement must reduce the debt-or’s mortgage payment (including principal and interest) and payments for various other specified expenses (i.e., real estate taxes, hazard insurance, mortgage insurance pre-mium, homeowners’ association dues, ground rent, and special assessments) to a percent-age of the debtor’s income in accordance with such guidelines. The payment may not include any period of negative amortization and it must fully amortize the outstanding mortgage principal. In addition, the agree-ment must not require the debtor to pay any fees or charges to obtain the modification. Further, the agreement must permit the debtor to continue to make these payments as if he or she had not filed for bankruptcy relief. 
Section 3. Eligibility for Relief . Section 3 
amends Bankruptcy Code section 109, which specifies the eligibility criteria for filing for bankruptcy relief, in two respects. First, it amends Bankruptcy Code section 109(e), which sets forth secured and unsecured debt limits to establish a debtor’s eligibility for relief under chapter 13. Section 3 amends this provision to provide that the computa-tion of debts does not include the secured or 
unsecured portions of debts secured by the debtor’s principal residence, under certain circumstances. The exception applies if the value of the debtor’s principal residence as of the date of the order for relief under chapter 13 is less than the applicable maximum amount of the secured debt limit specified in section 109(e). Alternatively, the exception applies if the debtor’s principal residence was sold in foreclosure or the debtor surren-dered such residence to the creditor and the value of such residence as of the date of the order for relief under chapter 13 is less than the secured debt limit specified in section 109(e). This amendment is not intended to create personal liability on a debt if there would not otherwise be personal liability on such debt. 
Second, section 3 amends Bankruptcy Code 
section 109(h), which requires a debtor to re-ceive credit counseling within the 180-day pe-riod prior to filing for bankruptcy relief, with limited exception. Section 3 amends this provision to allow a chapter 13 debtor to satisfy this requirement within 30 days after 
filing for bankruptcy relief if he or she sub-mits to the court a certification that the debtor has received notice that the holder of a claim secured by the debtor’s principal res-
idence may commence a foreclosure pro-ceeding. 
Section 4. Prohibiting Claims Arising from 
Violations of the Truth in Lending Act. Under 
the Truth in Lending Act, a mortgagor has a right of rescission with respect to a mort-gage secured by his or her residence, under certain circumstances. Bankruptcy Code sec-tion 502(b) enumerates various claims of creditors that are not entitled to payment in a bankruptcy case, subject to certain excep-tions. Section 4 amends Bankruptcy Code section 502(b) to provide that a claim for a loan secured by a security interest in the debtor’s principal residence is not entitled to payment in a bankruptcy case to the extent that such claim is subject to a remedy for re-scission under the Truth in Lending Act, notwithstanding the prior entry of a fore-closure judgment. In addition, section 4 specifies that nothing in this provision may be construed to modify, impair, or supersede any other right of the debtor. 
Section 5. Authority to Modify Certain Mort-
gages. Under Bankruptcy Code section 
1322(b)(2), a chapter 13 plan may not modify the terms of a mortgage secured solely by real property that is the debtor’s principal residence. Section 5 amends Bankruptcy Code section 1322(b) to create a limited ex-ception to this prohibition. As amended, the exception only applies to a mortgage that: (1) originated before the effective date of this amendment; and (2) is the subject of a notice that a foreclosure may be (or has been) com-menced with respect to such mortgage. 
In addition, the debtor must certify pursu-
ant to new section 1322(h) that he or she con-tacted—not less than 30 days before filing for bankruptcy relief—the mortgagee (or the en-tity collecting payments on behalf of such mortgagee) regarding modification of the mortgage. The debtor must also certify that he or she provided the mortgagee (or the en-tity collecting payments on behalf of such mortgagee) a written statement of the debt-or’s current income, expenses, and debt in a format that substantially conforms with the schedules required under Bankruptcy Code section 521 or with such other form as pro-mulgated by the Judicial Conference of the United States. Further, the certification must include a statement that the debtor considered any qualified loan modification offered to the debtor by the mortgagee (or the entity collecting payments on behalf of such holder). This requirement does not apply if the foreclosure sale is scheduled to

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E7 January 6, 2015 
occur within 30 days of the date on which the 
debtor files for bankruptcy relief. If the chapter 13 case is pending at the time new section 1322(h) becomes effective, then the debtor must certify that he or she attempted 
to contact the mortgagee (or the entity col-lecting payments on behalf of such mort-gagee) regarding modification of the mort-gage before either: (1) filing a plan under Bankruptcy Code section 1321 that contains a modification pursuant to new section 1322(b)(11); or (2) modifying a plan under Bankruptcy Code section 1323 or section 1329 to contain a modification pursuant to new section 1322(b)(11). 
Under new section 1322(b)(11), the debtor 
may propose a plan modifying the rights of the mortgagee (and the rights of the holder of any claim secured by a subordinate secu-rity interest in such residence) in several re-spects. It is important to note that the in-tent of new section 1322(b)(11) is permissive. Accordingly, a chapter 13 may propose a plan that proposes any or all types of modifica-tion authorized under section 1322(b)(11). 
First, the plan may provide for payment of 
the amount of the allowed secured claim as determined under section 506(a)(1). In mak-ing such determination, the court, pursuant to new section 1322(i), must use the fair arket value of the property at the date that such value is determined. If the issue of value is contested, the court must determine such value in accordance with the appraisal rules used by the Federal Housing Adminis-tration. 
Second, the plan may prohibit, reduce, or 
delay any adjustable interest rate applicable on, and after, the date of the filing of the plan. 
Third, it may extend the repayment period 
of the mortgage for a period that is not longer than the longer of 40 years (reduced by the period for which the mortgage has been outstanding) or the remaining term of the mortgage beginning on the date of the order for relief under chapter 13. 
Fourth, the plan may provide for the pay-
ment of interest at a fixed annual rate equal to the applicable average prime offer rate as of the date of the order for relief under chap-ter 13, as determined pursuant to certain specified criteria. The rate must correspond to the repayment term determined under new section 1322(b)(11)(C)(i) as published by the Federal Financial Institutions Examina-tion Council in its table entitled, ‘‘Average Prime Offer Rates—Fixed.’’ In addition, the rate must include a reasonable premium for risk. 
Fifth, the plan, pursuant to new section 
1322(b)(11)(D), may provide for payments of such modified mortgage directly to the hold-er of the claim or, at the discretion of the court, through the chapter 13 trustee during the term of the plan. The reference in new section 1322(b)(11)(D) to ‘‘holder of the claim’’ is intended to include a servicer of such mortgage for such holder. It is antici-pated that the court, in exercising its discre-tion with respect to allowing the debtor to make payments directly to the mortgagee or by requiring payments to be made through the chapter 13 trustee, will take into consid-eration the debtor’s ability to pay the trust-ee’s fees on payments disbursed through the trustee. 
New section 1322(g) provides that a claim 
may be reduced under new section 1322(b)(11)(A) only on the condition that the debtor agrees to pay the mortgagee a stated portion of the net proceeds of sale should the home be sold before the completion of all payments under the chapter 13 plan or before the debtor receives a discharge under section 1328(b). The debtor must pay these proceeds to the mortgagee within 15 days of when the debtor receives the net sales proceeds. If the residence is sold in the first year fol-
lowing the effective date of the chapter 13 plan, the mortgagee is to receive 90 percent of the difference between the sales price and the amount of the claim as originally deter-mined under section 1322(b)(11) (plus costs of sale and improvements), but not to exceed the unpaid amount of the allowed secured claim determined as if such claim had not been reduced under new section 1322(b)(11)(A). If the residence is sold in the second year following the effective date of the chapter 13 plan, then the applicable per-
centage is 70 percent. If the residence is sold in the third year following the effective date of the chapter 13 plan, then the applicable percentage is 50 percent. If the residence is sold in the fourth year following the effec-tive date of the chapter 13 plan, then the ap-plicable percentage is 30 percent. If the resi-dence is sold in the fifth year following the effective date of the chapter 13 plan, then the applicable percentage is ten percent. It is the intent of this provision that if the unsecured portion of the mortgagee’s claim is partially paid under this provision it should be recon-sidered under 502(j) and reduced accordingly. 
Section 6. Combating Excessive Fees. Section 
6 amends Bankruptcy Code section 1322(c) to provide that the debtor, the debtor’s prop-erty, and property of the bankruptcy estate are not liable for a fee, cost, or charge that is incurred while the chapter 13 case is pend-ing and that arises from a claim for debt se-cured by the debtor’s principal residence, un-less the holder of the claim complies with certain requirements. It is the intent of this provision that its reference to a fee, cost, or charge includes an increase in any applicable rate of interest for such claim. It also applies to a change in escrow account payments. 
To ensure such fee, cost, or charge is al-
lowed, the claimant must comply with cer-tain requirements. First, the claimant must file with the court and serve on the chapter 13 trustee, the debtor, and the debtor’s attor-ney an annual notice of such fee, cost, or charge (or on a more frequent basis as the court determines) before the earlier of ei-ther: one year of when such fee, cost, or charge was incurred, or 60 days before the case is closed. Second, the fee, cost, or charge must be lawful under applicable non-bankruptcy law, reasonable, and provided for in the applicable security agreement. Third, the value of the debtor’s principal residence must be greater than the amount of such claim, including such fee, cost or charge. 
If the holder fails to give the required no-
tice, such failure is deemed to be a waiver of any claim for such fees, costs, or charges for all purposes. Any attempt to collect such fees, costs, or charges constitutes a violation of the Bankruptcy Code’s discharge injunc-tion under section 524(a)(2) or the automatic stay under section 362(a), whichever is appli-cable. 
Section 6 further provides that a chapter 13 
plan may waive any prepayment penalty on a claim secured by the debtor’s principal res-idence. 
Section 7. Confirmation of Plan. Bankruptcy 
Code section 1325 sets forth the criteria for confirmation of a chapter 13 plan. Section 7 amends section 1325(a)(5) (which specifies the mandatory treatment that an allowed se-cured claim provided for under the plan must receive) to provide an exception for a claim modified under new section 1322(b)(11). The amendment also clarifies that payments under a plan that includes a modification of a claim under new section 1322(b)(11) must be in equal monthly amounts pursuant to sec-tion 1325(a)(5)(B)(iii)(I). 
In addition, section 7 specifies certain pro-
tections for a creditor whose rights are modified under new section 1322(b)(11). As a condition of confirmation, new section 1325(a)(10) requires a plan to provide that the 
creditor must retain its lien until the later of when: (1) the holder’s allowed secured claim (as modified) is paid; (2) the debtor completes all payments under the chapter 13 plan; or (3) if applicable, the debtor receives a discharge under section 1328(b). 
Section 7 also provides standards for con-
firming a chapter 13 plan that modifies a claim pursuant to new section 1322(b)(11). First, the debtor cannot have been convicted of obtaining by actual fraud the extension, renewal, or refinancing of credit that gives rise to such modified claim. Second, the modification must be in good faith. Lack of good faith exists if the debtor has no need for relief under this provision because the debtor can pay all of his or her debts and any future payment increases on such debts without dif-ficulty for the foreseeable future, including the positive amortization of mortgage debt. In determining whether a modification under 
section 1322(b)(11) that reduces the principal amount of the loan is made in good faith, the court must consider whether the holder of the claim (or the entity collecting payments on behalf of such holder) has offered the debtor a qualified loan modification that would enable the debtor to pay such debts and such loan without reducing the principal amount of the mortgage. 
Section 7 further amends section 1325 to 
add a new provision. New section 1325(d) au-thorizes the court, on request of the debtor or the mortgage holder, to confirm a plan proposing to reduce the interest rate lower than that specified in new section 1322(b)(11)(C)(ii), provided: 
(1) the modification does not reduce the 
mortgage principal; (2) the total mortgage payment is reduced through interest rate re-duction to the percentage of the debtor’s in-come that is the standard for a modification in accordance with the Obama Administra-tion’s Homeowner Affordability and Sta-bility Plan, as implemented on March 4, 2009; (3) the court determines that the debtor can afford such modification in light of the debt-or’s financial situation, after allowance of expense amounts that would be permitted for a debtor subject to section 1325(b)(3), regard-less of whether the debtor is otherwise sub-ject to such paragraph, and taking into ac-count additional debts and fees that are to be paid in chapter 13 and thereafter; and (4) the debtor is able to prevent foreclosure and pay a fully amortizing 30-year loan at such reduced interest rate without such reduction in principal. If the mortgage holder accepts a debtor’s proposed modification under this provision, the plan’s treatment is deemed to satisfy the requirements of section 1325(a)(5)(A) and the proposal should not be rejected by the court. 
Section 8. Discharge. Bankruptcy Code sec-
tion 1328 sets forth the requirements by which a chapter 13 debtor may obtain a dis-charge and the scope of such discharge. Sec-tion 8 amends section 1328(a) to clarify that the unpaid portion of an allowed secured claim modified under new section 1322(b)(11) is not discharged. This provision is not in-tended to create a claim for a deficiency where such a claim would not otherwise exist. 
Section 9. Standing Trustee Fees. Section 9(a) 
amends 28 U.S.C. § 586(e)(1)(B)(i) to provide that a chapter 13 trustee may receive a com-mission set by the Attorney General of no more than four percent on payments made under a chapter 13 plan and disbursed by the chapter 13 trustee to a creditor whose claim was modified under Bankruptcy Code section 1322(b)(11), unless the bankruptcy court waives such fees based on a determination that the debtor has income less than 150 per-cent of the official poverty line applicable to the size of the debtor’s family and payment

of such fees would render the debtor’s plan 
infeasible. 
With respect to districts not under the 
United States trustee system, section 9(b) makes a conforming revision to section 302(d)(3) of the Bankruptcy Judges, United States Trustees, and Family Farmer Bank-ruptcy Act of 1986. 
Section 10. Effective Date; Application of 
Amendments. Section 10(a) provides that this 
measure and the amendments made by it, ex-cept as provided in subsection (b), take effect on the Act’s date of enactment. 
Section 10(b)(1) provides, except as pro-
vided in paragraph (2), that the amendments made by this measure apply to cases com-menced under title 11 of the United States Code before, on, or after the Act’s date of en-actment. Section 10(b)(2) specifies that para-graph (1) does not apply with respect to cases that are closed under the Bankruptcy Code as of the date of the enactment of this Act. 
Section 11. GAO Study. Section 11 requires 
the Government Accountability Office to complete a study and to submit a report to the House and Senate Judiciary Committees within two years from the enactment of this Act. The report must contain the results of the study of: (1) the number of debtors who filed cases under chapter 13, during the one- year period beginning on the date of the en-actment of this Act for the purpose of re-structuring their principal residence mort-gages; (2) the number of mortgages restruc-tured under this Act that subsequently re-sulted in default and foreclosure; (3) a com-parison between the effectiveness of mort-gages restructured under programs outside of bankruptcy, such as Hope Now and Hope for Homeowners, and mortgages restructured under this Act; (4) the number of appeals in cases where mortgages were restructured under this Act; (5) the number of such ap-peals where the bankruptcy court’s decision was overturned; and (6) the number of bank-ruptcy judges disciplined as a result of ac-tions taken to restructure mortgages under this Act. In addition, the report must in-clude a recommendation as to whether such amendments should be amended to include a sunset clause. 
Section 12. Report to Congress. Not later 
than 18 months after the date of enactment of this Act, the Government Accountability Office, in consultation with the Federal Housing Administration, must submit to Congress a report containing: (1) a com-prehensive review of the effects of the Act’s amendments on bankruptcy courts; (2) a sur-vey of whether the types of homeowners eli-gible for the program should be limited; and (3) a recommendation on whether such amendments should remain in effect.

RECOGNIZING DUANE BUR-
LINGAME OF FREEPORT, ILLI-NOIS 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
talk about Mr. Duane Burlingame of Freeport, Illinois. 
Duane Burlingame is a tremendous athlete 
and is currently one of the top master powerlifters in the world. He has won six world titles and recently achieved best lifter heavy-weight honors at the 18th annual Welker Engi-neering World Association of Bench Pressers and Deadlifters Championships in Las Vegas. He has accomplished all of this despite pre-vious injuries, and while serving his commu-
nity. 
Duane Burlingame truly lives his life for oth-
ers while doing what he loves to do. Over his 17 year career, he has raised funds for SIDS, the American Cancer Society, and St. Jude Children’s Hospital through asking friends and supporters to pledge money per pound he lifts. By lifting 551 pounds for one of his most re-cent competitions, he made it clear that he is putting his talent to work for the benefit of those in need in a very big way. This year, Duane Burlingame will be sending toys to chil-dren at St. Judes’ for Christmas. He explained that he was ‘‘much more excited going out and buying toys to send to children’’ than when he went to the World Championships. He believes that by giving back during difficult times we can all make a big difference. Duane also runs a personal training business and has previously provided fitness and nutrition plans free of charge to those in his community in need. 
Mr. Speaker, I’d like to thank Duane Bur-
lingame for his dedication to our community and for supporting important organizations that help to keep all of our communities healthy.

Mr. BEN RAY LUJA ´N of New Mexico. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize the National Association of Music Merchants (NAMM) Deal-er of the Year, The Candyman Strings & Things of Santa Fe. 
The Candyman Strings & Things, owned by 
Rand and Cindy Cook, has been a staple in the Santa Fe community since they opened its doors in 1969, and was awarded Dealer of the Year for its innovative and effective practices, as well as for setting an outstanding example for its peers in the musical instrument and products industry. Additionally, Candyman was also given the Music Makes a Difference award for promoting music in its community. Candyman serves to inspire its industry and also aspires to serve its community through numerous educational and scholarship pro-grams. Through its charitable contributions and outreach work, Candyman has made a difference in the lives of customers, schools, and children. 
Small businesses are an important part of 
local communities. Candyman is an example of a small business that has been successful and has had a positive impact in Northern New Mexico. While I applaud Candyman’s ef-forts to ensure a high level of service to its customers, I am even more impressed by its service to the community and efforts to pro-vide mentoring and learning opportunities for young music enthusiasts. Once again, I con-gratulate The Candyman Strings & Things for being awarded both the Dealer of the Year and Music Makes a Difference awards, and thank the entire team for its exceptional serv-ice to our community.

REMEMBERING CLINT REIF 
HON. MIKE QUIGLEY 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 
Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
remember and honor the life of an important and respected member of the Chicago com-munity. 
On December 21st, we lost a vital asset and 
key individual to the Chicago Blackhawks team, with the passing of Clint Reif. 
In his ninth season with the Blackhawks and 
sixth as assistant equipment manager, Clint ensured that his team was suited up and ready to play to the best of their ability day in and day out.

Arriving early and leaving late, Clint had one 
of the all-important duties of maintaining and repairing equipment. And we all know how gentle hockey players are on their equipment. Because of Clint’s attention to detail and pro-fessionalism, no Blackhawks player was ever left on the ice without exactly what he needed. 
But beyond that, he was a family man, with 
four charming children—Florence, C.J., Aislynn and Colette—and his loving wife, Kelly. He was also devoted to his community, spearheading the team’s initiative to outfit the Wounded Warriors hockey team with brand new equipment this past March. The Wounded Warriors Project (WWP) aims to raise aware-ness and enlist the public’s generosity for the needs of injured service members. Clint re-spected and admired those brave men and women who fought to ensure our freedoms and gave back in true Clint fashion—with hockey equipment. 
Another great sports influence in the city of 
Chicago, Phil Jackson, once said, ‘‘The strength of the team is each individual mem-ber. The strength of each member is the team.’’ With the passing of Clint, the Chicago Blackhawks lost an irreplaceable individual from their team, one that helped lead them to two Stanley Cup Championships. 
A one of a kind guy, Clint will be greatly 
missed by the Blackhawks, the City of Chi-cago and the entire hockey community. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring 
and celebrating his life.

INTRODUCTION OF A BILL TO PRO-
TECT THE PRIVACY OF CON-SUMERS AND REDUCE THEIR VULNERABILITY TO IDENTITY THEFT 
HON. JOHN CONYERS, JR. 
OF MICHIGAN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 
Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, today, I am in-
troducing the ‘‘Cyber Privacy Fortification Act of 2014.’’ This bill would provide criminal pen-alties for the failure to comply with federal or state obligations to report security breaches of the sensitive personally identifiable information of individuals. Certain breaches would also be required to be reported to the FBI or the Se-cret Service. The bill would also require fed-eral agencies engaged in rulemaking related to personally identifiable information to publish privacy impact statements relating to the im-pact of the proposed rule. 
One of the main motivators for cybercrime 
and computer network intrusions is financial gain. Intrusions into networks of financial insti-tutions and businesses may yield information, often on a large scale, about customers such as credit and debit card numbers, Social Se-curity numbers, birth dates, account pass-words, and other personally identifiable infor-mation. Information obtained through such data breaches may be used to steal from the accounts of the customers, use their credit cards, hack into their personal communica-tions, or the information may be sold to others who commit these crimes or compile provides about individuals which others might find valu-able. 
With constant revelations about new data 
breaches impacting millions of Americans, we must take additional steps to protect the sen-
sitive information of consumers maintained on corporate databases. This bill will provide a greater incentive for companies to provide no-tice of breaches consumers’ sensitive informa-tion such as Social Security numbers and fi-nancial account numbers. This protects the privacy of our citizens and allows them to be vigilant against identity theft.

TRIBUTES FOR GOV. JAMES B. 
EDWARDS 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speak-
er, the hometown, Charleston Lowcountry daily newspaper of the Post and Courier rec-ognized Doctor Edwards with a thoughtful edi-torial and heartfelt columns were provided by former staffers Robert G. Liming and Ron Brinson. 
[From The Post and Courier, Dec. 27, 2014] 
JAMES B. E DWARDS  
James B. Edwards exhibited, among many 
other positive attributes, a keen sense of the politically possible. So when the oral sur-geon from Mount Pleasant launched his 1974 gubernatorial bid, he knew it was a very long shot. 
Yet he also knew something few politicians 
or pundits of that time realized: A powerful public demand for limited government and fiscal responsibility—and for a more conserv-ative Republican party to lead that charge— was on the rise. 
It was made to order for Dr. Edwards’ po-
litical philosophy. And his engaging personal style helped him advance those goals on be-half of the public he served so well for so long as, among other jobs, governor of South Carolina and president of the Medical Uni-versity of South Carolina. 
His death Friday at age 87 warrants a fresh 
recognition of his remarkable, admirable legacy—in and out of elective office. 
How stacked did the deck look against Dr. 
Edwards’ 1974 run for governor? 
It had been less than two years since he 
had won his first elective office as a state senator. It had been three years since he had lost his run for the 1st District congressional seat, though he did win the GOP nonmination in that race. 
And it had been 100 years since South Caro-
linians had elected a Republican governor. Dr. Edwards’ GOP primary opponent, retired Gen. William Westmoreland, had a huge name-recognition edge. And even after Dr. Edwards won that primary, he again was the underdog in the general election. 
But Democratic primary winner Charles 
‘‘Pug’’ Ravenel was removed as his party’s nominee on a residency challenge, elevating runner-up William Jennings Bryan Dorn to the ballot. Dr. Edwards made 20th century history by defeating the 13-term congress-man from the 3rd District. 
During his 1975–79 gubernatoral tenure, Dr. 
Edwards further established himself as a major player in the GOP’s shift to the right. After initially supporting former Texas Gov. John Connally, Gov. Edwards became a prominent supporter of Ronald Reagan’s 1976 bid for the party’s presidential nomination against incumbent Gerald Ford. Though that effort fell short, it set the stage for Mr. Rea-gan’s successful 1980 run. 
Despite his solid conservative credentials, 
Gov. Edwards established himself as a mas-ter of crossing party lines. As governor, he 
worked with the Democratic-controlled Sen-ate and House to expand South Carolina’s in-dustrial base with assorted incentives, uplift poor school districts with the Education Fi-
nance Act and protect the state’s long-term financial stability with a ‘‘rainy day’’ fund. 
Gov. Edwards also advanced the reorga-
nization of state government. One of his al-lies in Columbia, Carroll Campbell, later be-came an effective champion of that cause during his two terms as governor (1987–95). 
S.C. governors were limited to a single 
term when Dr. Edwards served in that posi-tion. So after Mr. Reagan won the presidency in 1980, Dr. Edwards became U.S. energy sec-retary. 
He and President Reagan advocated elimi-
nating the department. As then-Secretary Edwards warned: ‘‘There is only one thing that produces energy, and that’s the private sector, which government has hamstrung.’’ 
Secretary Edwards and his boss pushed to 
fold the agency into the Department of Com-merce. Though Congress wouldn’t go along with that, Energy Secretary Edwards did manage to deeply cut the agency’s budget and reduce its staff by 2,000. 
He stepped up to another challenge in 1996, 
joining fellow former Govs. Campbell, John West, Robert McNair and Dick Riley in bi- partisan backing of Gov. David Beasley’s courageous call to remove the Confederate battle flag from the Statehouse dome. 
And under his 1982–99 leadership as MUSC 
president, the size of the campus more than tripled from 1.5 million square feet to 5 mil-lion square feet. Along the expanding way, MUSC’s reputation for providing both high- quality medical education and health care grew, too. In that ongoing process, the school has attracted top medical, research and teaching talent. 
MUSC paid fitting tribute to its former 
leader in 2010 when it dedicated the James B. Edwards College of Dental Medicine. At the time of the dental college dedication, Dr. Jack Sanders, dean of that school, offered this accurate assessment of Dr. Edwards’ lasting contributions: 
‘‘His entire life stands as a testament to 
the values of integrity and service, which we hope to instill in each of our students.’’ 
James B. Edwards’ legacy in South Caro-
lina, at MUSC and beyond will long live on.

IMEDWARDS HADTRANSFORMATIVE ROLE IN  
S.C. S HIFT TO GOP 
(By Robert G. Liming) 
He wasn’t a four-star general, legendary 
Old South congressman or media-savvy Wall Street investment broker, yet he forever transformed Palmetto State politics. 
James Burrows Edwards was the exception 
to every rule in predictable partisan politics. The affable oral surgeon was given no chance of being elected as he paid his filing fee at GOP Headquarters on Columbia’s Harden Street in spring of 1974. 
He defied backroom dealmakers in the 
then fledgling Republican Party by thrash-ing their hand-picked contender, West Point-er Gen. William C. Westmoreland, in the Re-publican primary. 
Democratic Party bosses were so fearful of 
a Westmoreland candidacy they failed to no-tice the meteoric rise of Wall Street whiz Charles D. ‘‘Pug’’ Ravenel who used slick tel-evision ads and media manipulation to stun-ningly defeat their anointed, veteran Green-wood congressman, William Jennings Bryan Dorn, in a bitterly contested primary. 
Dorn surprisingly became the eventual 
Democratic nominee after a tumultuous legal battle resulting in a Supreme Court ruling disqualifying Ravenel because he failed to meet the state’s legal residency re-quirement. The court’s decision paved the

way for Edwards’ implausible November 
election win. His cash-starved campaign’s upset signaled the end of the Democratic death-grip dominance over the state’s 46 county courthouses. 
Jim Edwards took the oath on a frigid Jan-
uary morning in 1975 and rocked the very po-litical foundation of the Statehouse. Defying political pundits and power brokers, he be-came the first Republican chief executive since the Union troops fled Columbia, leav-ing then-Gov. Daniel Chamberlain holding his empty carpetbag. 
Most current ‘‘life-long’’ Republican office-
holders never met Jim, and those who did can hardly grasp the fact they owe their very opportunity to serve to his courage, char-acter and dedication to public service. There were less than two dozen Republicans in the legislature in 1974, and Nikki Haley was only three years old the evening Jim gave his first state of the State address. 
I was a brash and flippant political re-
porter when I accepted the role as his official spokesman, a hard choice for him since he really didn’t know me well. But like so many decisions he made, Jim took his time, weighed all the facts, sought the advice of others and made the final decision on his own. We grew closer and soon our inner of-fice humor abounded, I recall how I coined his nickname as ‘‘veto king’’ and he labeled me as ‘‘Dr. No’’ because of the effort I put into composing the veto messages he signed on numerous pieces of legislation. As a Re-publican it was his strongest weapon against a Democratic-dominated General Assembly when compromise became impossible. 
In today’s atmosphere of instant assess-
ment, weblogs of every ilk, and babbling talking heads few if any will recall his countless accomplishments. Jim’s strongest skill was his personal ability to sit down one on one and resolve issues, a talent so sadly missing today in Columbia and Washington. Jim was the leader in establishing the state’s ‘‘rainy day’’ reserve fund to cover budget shortfalls and unforeseen emer-gencies; he championed the Education Fi-nance Act to ensure equal funding options for all public schools; led the fight for the state’s first tidelands protection laws; and pioneered the reform of the state’s festeringly inefficient and ineffective cash- devouring welfare system. 
He had no political hit list and he held no 
grudges. Jim was guided by the wisdom and character he learned from his school teacher parents; the patriotism he shared as a Mer-chant Marine and later Navy officer; the car-ing he learned as a surgeon; and his abiding faith and trust in God. 
His first love was for his forever first lady, 
Ann, their precious daughter and son, Cath-erine and James Jr., and the beloved grand-children. Yet there was always a special place in his heart for the people of South Carolina, including the Allendale dyed-in- the-wool Democrat farmer who Jim always trusted because he voted for the other guy! 
As I recall Jim, this verse will always 
come to mind: Mark 1:11. We will miss you and your wonderful smile; you were an ex-traordinary governor, wonderful boss and a dear friend.

UNDAMENTAL GOODNESS WAS THE ESSENCE  
OFJIMEDWARDS  
(By Ron Brinson) 
Jim Edwards has died, and there is a void 
in the heart and soul and political spirit of his beloved South Carolina. 
This good man was an American patriot, a 
principled leader. 
His gracious humility framed his soaring 
intellect. His life was anchored by those simple old- 
fashioned American values of education and enterprise, of caring for your family and your neighbors and your country—and al-ways translating that ‘‘care’’ with meaning-ful commitments and achievement. 
He was my friend. He was everyone’s 
friend. 
History’s bare facts will describe Dr. 
Edwards as one of those upstart Goldwater Republicans who back in the ’60s forged a special brand of post-war American conserv-atism. He stood side by side with the likes of Ronald Reagan as the Grand Old Party of Abraham Lincoln was reborn, or in today’s parlance, ‘‘rebooted.’’ 
But in the mid-’60s, Jim Edwards was a 
young oral surgeon, married to Ann Dar-lington, the love of his life, and they had a very young family. Personal and professional sacrifice defined his entry into what he once called ‘‘patriot politics.’’ He was determined, he said, to square America’s political com-pass with ‘‘the values and principles that make America America.’’ 
In 1974, he was a Charleston-area state sen-
ator encouraged to run in the Republican primary for governor—against William West-moreland, the retired four-star commanding general of U.S. forces in Vietnam. At the time it seemed to many—and perhaps to Dr. Edwards himself—that he was merely the sacrificial political lamb for Gen. Westmore-land’s homecoming reach for the governor’s office. 
Four decades later, we might reckon it was 
a package of mysterious and fortuitous polit-ical providence at work, confecting a dra-matic turning point for South Carolina’s pol-itics and for Jim Edwards’ leadership career. Dr. Edwards was a natural born campaigner, so genuine and sincere. Truth is, Gen. West-moreland really never had much of a chance to win that primary. 
But then Jim Edwards didn’t have much 
chance, either, to prevail in his general elec-tion campaign against Democrat Charles ‘‘Pug’’ Ravenel, the Charleston-born Wall Street whiz-kid investment banker. Ah, but providence often is a persistent force in the chancy processes of politics. Mr. Ravenel ran afoul of a five-year residential requirement. He might still have had Lowcountry pluff- mud in his toes, but the S.C. Supreme Court nullified his candidacy. Jim Edwards had performed well on the primary campaign trail, and some big-name folks with big bank accounts were lining up to respond to his call for a march back toward ‘‘conserv-atism.’’ 
U.S. Rep. William Jennings Bryan Dorn, D- 
Greenwood, with his late start and his party well off balance, had only a puncher’s chance as Ravenel’s replacement. On Nov. 5, 1974, James Burrows Edwards became the first Re-publican governor of South Carolina since Reconstruction. In his affable and witty manner, he declared. ‘‘A lot of Democrats will say I’m the first mistake South Carolina has made in a hundred years.’’ 
Dr. Edwards, in his inaugural speech, em-
phasized an often-neglected value of elected governance—results over partisanship. ‘‘I begin not with any partisan goals or debts to any special interests, but rather as the re-cipient of a public trust from 2.8 million great people; people who are hungry for lead-ership that is not concerned with politics, but dedicated to building responsive and ef-fective government. Let us all reach across political barriers and work together to im-prove our state . . .’’ 
The politics of election and then govern-
ance are different, and for Gov. Edwards, ‘‘non-partisanship’’ equaled political smart-ness. With only a handful of Republicans in the Legislature, he worked proactively to calibrate agendas with Speaker of the House Sol Blatt, and Senate leaders Marion 
Gressette and Rembert Dennis. 
‘‘The agenda is important,’’ he once told 
Sens. Gressette and Dennis. ‘‘But we have to work, too, on how best to work together.’’ 
A few years ago, he lamented with that 
warming smile, ‘‘Sometimes, it feels like the biggest problem with Republicans is that we’ve forgotten how to get along with each other.’’ 
Everyone, it seemed, got along with Jim 
Edwards. His gubernatorial record showed steady improvements fiscally and in public education, a nice package of organizational and management reforms and a new empha-sis on marketing South Carolina for indus-trial and commercial growth. Against the very strong opposition of his Mount Pleasant neighbors, Gov. Edwards approved the S.C. State Ports Authority,s Wando container terminal project. 
And folks always appreciated Jim 
Edwards’ ‘‘style’’ of friendship and loyalty. 
As President Reagan’s energy secretary, he 
fronted Reagan’s agenda to terminate the Department of Energy. Editorialists were merciless. ‘‘It was a joyless ride of mis-informed ‘establishment’ ridicule,’’ Dr. Edwards once said, laughing. ‘‘But President Reagan felt very strongly about this and my job was to try to get it done.’’ 
The U.S. Department of Energy still 
stands, of course, but respect and admiration for Jim Edwards were ascending even as he left Washington in 1982 to assume the presi-dency of the Medical University of South Carolina. His tenure there was exceptional, especially in growing the school’s foundation endowments, something very related to his standing in industry and politics. 
Every elected leader should consider Jim 
Edwards’ point about working first to get along with each other. Every American might consider the grid of patriotic and good governance principles that guided his per-sonal, professional and political lives. But for those who knew this good man for a mo-ment—or for 50 years—we will rejoice that we crossed paths with him. 
A year ago, after Dr. Edwards had suffered 
a stroke, I asked him about his ‘‘legacy.’’ He answered softly, ‘‘That can be so subjective; it’s in the eyes of the beholder.’’ 
I told him I wanted an answer, that I 
might be writing commentary one day about his ‘‘legacy.’’ 
He paused for a moment and then added, ‘‘I 
hope someone will say I loved my family and my country, and that they noticed I always tried to do my best.’’ 
Let us not be confused by such natural hu-
mility; Jim Edwards truly was a great man.

Ms. BORDALLO. Mr. Speaker, today I have

Since being elected to the House of Representatives ten years ago, I have introduced a version of this legislation in each Congress.

the Interior Gale Norton and established by an 
Act of the 107th Congress (Public Law 107– 333). The Review Commission, in a unani-mous report to Congress in June 2004, found that there were significant disparities in the treatment of war claims for the people of Guam as compared with war claims for other Americans. The Review Commission also found that the occupation of Guam was espe-cially brutal due to the unfailing loyalty of the people of Guam to the United States of Amer-ica. The people of Guam were subjected to forced labor, forced marches, internment, beatings, rapes and executions, including pub-lic beheadings. The Review Commission rec-ommended that Congress remedy this injus-tice through the enactment of legislation to au-
thorize payment of claims in amounts speci-fied. Specifically, the bill would authorize dis-cretionary spending to pay claims consistent with the recommendations of the commission. 
It is important to note that the Review Com-
mission found that the United States Govern-ment seized Japanese assets during the war and that the record shows that settlement of claims was meant to be paid from these for-feitures. Furthermore, the United States signed a Treaty of Peace with Japan on Sep-tember 8, 1951, which precludes Americans from making claims against Japan for war rep-arations. The treaty closed any legal mecha-nism for seeking redress from the Government of Japan, and the United States Government has settled claims for U.S. citizens and other nationals through various claims programs au-thorized by Congress. 
The text that I introduce in this Congress 
addresses concerns that have been raised about the legislation. First, the text reflects a compromise that was reached with the Senate when they considered the legislation as a pro-vision of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011. That compromise re-moves payment of claims to heirs of survivors who suffered personal injury during the enemy occupation. The bill continues to provide pay-ment of claims to survivors of the occupation as well as to heirs of citizens of Guam who died during the occupation. The compromise continues to uphold the intent of recognizing the people of Guam for their loyalty to the United States during World War II. 
Further, the bill that I introduce today con-
tains an offset for the estimated cost of the bill. I understood the concerns express by some of my colleagues in a July 14, 2011 hearing on this legislation. My colleagues ex-pressed concern that there was no offset to pay for the cost of the bill. Guam war claims has a very simple offset that will pay for the cost of the legislation over time. The bill would be paid by section 30 funding remitted to Guam through the U.S. Department of Interior at any level above section 30 funds that were remitted to Guam in fiscal year 2012. With the impending relocation of Marines from Okinawa to Guam as well as additional Navy and Air Force personnel relocating to Guam it is ex-pected that Guam will receive additional sec-tion 30 funds. Claims would then be paid out over time based off the additional amounts that were made available in any given year. Not only does this offset address payment of claims but it only impacts my jurisdiction and is a credible source of funding that will ensure that claims will be paid. Moreover, the Con-gressional Budget Office (CBO) indicates in Senate report 113–146 that accompanied S. 1237, the Omnibus Territories Act of 2012, 
that the offset ensures the bill would not cost the federal government additional funds. Spe-cifically it states, ‘‘any such future payments due to Guam that exceed the amount paid in 2012 would instead be paid to a new U.S. Treasury fund that would be available to make compensation payments. CB0 estimates that the collection and spending of those funds would have no significant net impact on direct spending over the 2015–2024 period.’’ Con-gressional passage of this bill has a direct im-pact on the future success of the military buildup. The need for Guam War Claims was brought about because of mishandling of war claims immediately following World War II by the Department of the Navy. The long-stand-ing inequity with how Guam was treated for war reparations lingers today. If we do not bring this matter to a close I believe that sup-port for the military build-up will erode and im-pact the readiness of our forces and the bilat-eral relationship with Japan. 
Mr Speaker, resolving this issue is a matter 
of justice. This carefully crafted compromise legislation addresses the concerns of the Sen-ate and fiscal conservatives in the House of Representatives. This bill represents a unique opportunity to right a wrong because many of the survivors of the occupation are nearing the end of their lives. It is important that the Con-gress act on the recommendations of the Guam War Claims Review Commission to fi-nally resolve this longstanding injustice for the people of Guam.

PROTECTING EMPLOYEES AND RE-
TIREES IN MUNICIPAL BANK-RUPTCIES ACT OF 2015 
HON. JOHN CONYERS, JR. 
OF MICHIGAN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 
Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I submit the 
following. 
SUMMARY  
When a municipality files for bankruptcy, 
its employees and retirees who have devoted their lives to public service—such as police officers, firefighters, sanitation workers and office personnel—risk having their hard- earned wages, pensions and health benefits cut or even eliminated. 
This is why I am introducing the ‘‘Pro-
tecting Employees and Retirees in Municipal Bankruptcies Act of 2015.’’ This legislation strengthens protections for employees and retirees under chapter 9 municipality bank-ruptcy cases by: (1) clarifying the criteria that a municipality must meet before it can obtain chapter 9 bankruptcy relief; (2) ensur-ing that the interests of employees and retir-ees are represented in the chapter 9 case; and (3) imposing heightened standards that a mu-nicipality must meet before it may modify any collective bargaining agreement or re-tiree benefit. 
While many municipalities often work to 
limit the impact of budget cuts on their em-ployees and retirees, as demonstrated in the chapter 9 plan of adjustment approved by De-troit’s public employees and retirees, other municipalities could try to use current bank-ruptcy law to set aside collective bargaining agreements and retiree protections. 
My legislation addresses this risk by re-
quiring the municipality to engage in mean-ingful good faith negotiations with its em-ployees and retirees before the municipality 
can apply for chapter 9 bankruptcy relief. This measure would also expedite the appel-late review process of whether a munici-pality has complied with this and other re-quirements. And, the bill ensures employees and retirees have a say in any plan that would modify their benefits. 
SECTION -BY-SECTION EXPLANATION  
Sec. 1. Short Title. Section 1 of the bill sets 
forth the short title of the bill as the ‘‘Pro-tecting Employees and Retirees in Municipal Bankruptcies Act of 2015.’’ 
Sec. 2. Determination of Municipality Eligi-
bility To Be a Debtor Under Chapter 9 of Title 11 of the United States Code. A municipality 
can petition to be a debtor under chapter 9, a specialized form of bankruptcy relief, only if a bankruptcy court finds by a preponder-ance of the evidence that the municipality satisfies certain criteria specified in Bank-ruptcy Code section 109. In the absence of ob-taining the consent of a majority of its creditors, section 109 requires the munici-pality, in pertinent part, to have negotiated in good faith with its creditors or prove that it is unable to negotiate with its creditors because such negotiation is impracticable. 
Section 2(a) of the bill amends Bankruptcy 
Code section 109 in three respects. First, it provides clear guidance to the bankruptcy court that the term ‘‘good faith’’ is intended to have the same meaning as it has under the National Labor Relations Act at least with respect to creditors who are employees or retirees of the debtor. Second, section 2(a) revises the standard for futility of negotia-tion from ‘‘impracticable’’ to ‘‘impossible.’’ This change ensures that before a munici-pality may avail itself of chapter 9 bank-ruptcy relief it must prove that there was no possible way it could have engaged in nego-tiation in lieu of seeking such relief. Third, the amendment clarifies that the standard of proof that the municipality must meet is ‘‘clear and convincing’’ rather than a prepon-derance of the evidence. These revisions to section 109 will provide greater guidance to the bankruptcy court in assessing whether a municipality has satisfied the Bankruptcy Code’s eligibility requirements for being granted relief under chapter 9. 
Bankruptcy Code section 921(e), in relevant 
part, prohibits a bankruptcy court from or-dering a stay of any proceeding arising in a chapter 9 case on account of an appeal from an order granting a municipality’s petition to be a debtor under chapter 9. Section 2(b) strikes this prohibition thereby allowing a court to issue a stay of any proceeding dur-ing the pendency of such an appeal. This en-sures that the status quo can be maintained until there is a final appellate determination of whether a municipality is legally eligible to be a chapter 9 debtor. 
Typically, an appeal of a bankruptcy court 
decision is heard by a district or bankruptcy appellate panel court. Under limited cir-cumstances, however, a direct appeal from a bankruptcy court decision may be heard by a court of appeals. Until a final determination is made as to whether a municipality is eli-gible to be a debtor under chapter 9 of the Bankruptcy Code, the rights and responsibil-ities of numerous stakeholders are unclear. To expedite the appellate process and pro-mote greater certainty to all stakeholders in the case, section 2(c) of the bill allows an ap-peal of a bankruptcy court order granting a municipality’s petition to be a chapter 9 debtor to be filed directly with the court of appeals. In addition, section 2(c) requires the court of appeals to hear such appeal de novo 
on the merits as well as to determine it on an expedited basis. Finally, section 2(c) specifies that the doctrine of equitable mootness does not apply to such an appeal.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E12 January 6, 2015 
Sec. 3. Protecting Employees and Retirees. 
The chapter 9 debtor must file a plan for the adjustment of the municipality’s debts that then must be confirmed by the bankruptcy court if it satisfies certain criteria specified in Bankruptcy Code section 943. Section 3 of the bill makes several amendments to cur-rent law intended to ensure that interests of municipal employees and retirees are better protected. With respect to plan confirmation requirements, section 3 amends Bankruptcy Code section 943 to require consent from such employees and retirees to any plan that impairs—in a manner prohibited by non-bankruptcy law—a collective bargaining agreement, a retiree benefit, including an ac-crued pension, retiree health, or other retire-ment benefit protected by state or municipal law or as defined in Bankruptcy Code section 1114(a). 
Such consent would be conveyed to the 
court by the authorized representative of such individuals. Subject to certain excep-tions, section 3 specifies that the authorized representative of individuals receiving any retirement benefits pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement is the labor organiza-tion that signed such agreement unless such organization no longer represents active em-ployees. Where the organization no longer represents active employees of the munici-pality, the labor organization that currently represents active employees in that bar-gaining unit is the authorized representative of such individuals. 
Section 3 provides that the exceptions 
apply if: (1) the labor organization chooses not to serve as the authorized representa-tive; or (2) the court determines, after a mo-tion by a party in interest and after notice and a hearing, that different representation is appropriate. Under either circumstance, the court, upon motion by any party in in-terest and after notice and a hearing, must order the United States Trustee to appoint a committee of retired employees if the debtor seeks to modify or not pay the retiree bene-fits or if the court otherwise determines that it is appropriate for that committee be com-prised of such individuals to serve as the au-thorized representative. 
With respect to retired employees not cov-
ered by a collective bargaining agreement, the court, on motion by a party in interest after notice and a hearing, must order the United States Trustee to appoint a com-mittee of retired employees if the debtor seeks to modify or not pay retiree benefits, or if the court otherwise determines that it is appropriate to serve as the authorized rep-resentative of such employees. Section 3 pro-vides that the party requesting the appoint-ment of a committee has the burden of proof. 
Where the court grants a motion for the 
appointment of a retiree committee, section 3 requires the United States Trustee to choose individuals to serve on the committee on a proportional basis per capita based on organization membership from among mem-bers of the organizations that represent the individuals with respect to whom such order is entered. This requirement ensures that the committee, in a case where there are multiple labor organizations, fairly rep-resents the interests of the members of those various organizations on a proportional basis. 
Finally, section 3 of the bill imposes a sig-
nificant threshold that must be met before retiree benefits can be reduced or elimi-nated. Current law has no such requirement. In a case where the municipality proposes in its plan to impair any right to a retiree ben-efit, section 3 permits the committee to sup-port such impairment only if at least two- thirds of its members vote in favor of doing so.

HONORING MICK FOUNTS, ED.D., 
SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY SUPER-INTENDENT OF EDUCATION 
HON. JEFF DENHAM 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 
Mr. DENHAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
acknowledge and honor Mick Founts, Ed.D., San Joaquin County Superintendent of Edu-cation, who is retiring after many years of out-standing service to our community. 
In 1976, Mick Founts graduated from Hum-
boldt State University with a B.A. in English. Four years later, he obtained his Master’s De-gree in Education and two credentials: Admin-istrative and Pupil Personnel Services. Mick was awarded his Doctor of Education degree from University of the Pacific in 1995. During his 38 year career in education he has been an English classroom teacher, high school and college football coach, assistant principal for a continuation school, assistant principal for a comprehensive high school, a Coordinator of Child Welfare and Attendance, a Director of Alternative Programs, an Assistant Super-intendent of Alternative Education Programs and Charters, an Associate Superintendent of County Operated Schools and Programs, Dep-uty Superintendent of San Joaquin County Of-fice of Education Student Programs and Serv-ices, and in 2010 was elected as San Joaquin County Superintendent of Schools. As Super-intendent of Schools, Founts is charged with the ultimate responsibility for all activities of San Joaquin County Office of Education. 
In 1991 Mick began the San Joaquin Coun-
ty Office of Education Community School Pro-gram. The ‘‘one.Program’’ includes Court School as well as Community School and is recognized throughout the State as an innova-tive alternative education program. It now serves more than 1,500 at-risk students work-ing to overcome obstacles leading to a high school diploma. Mick was the Juvenile Court, Community, and Alternative School Adminis-trators of California President elect (1996–97), President (1997–1998), and Past President (1998–1999). 
Superintendent Founts has either authorized 
or developed some of the most unique public charter schools in California. These include agricultural academies, technology sites, fine and performing arts high schools, collegiate sports academies, career and technical edu-cation academies, and many more . . . all within San Joaquin County. Dr. Founts cur-
rently served as a Commissioner on the Cali-fornia State Board of Education Advisory Commission on Charter Schools. His commit-ment to Career and Technical Education, Agri-culture, Migrant Education, Technology, and Outdoor Education is constant, as is his com-mitment to Teachers College of San Joaquin; the first college operated by a County Office of education. This commitment extends to the many events that SJCOE sponsors for stu-
dents throughout the County: Academic De-cathlon, Science Olympiad, Math Olympiad, Mock Trial, as well as the local and State Spelling Bee, to name just a few. 
In 2013, he was one of twenty Superintend-
ents to work with Governor Brown to support the reform effort aimed at bringing more money to children in our schools. In addition, he championed a variety of programs to fill the void in operations and support programs cre-ated from budget cuts in sports, technology, and art clinics, as well as helped fundraise to send more than 200 students to Outdoor Edu-cation by way of fundraising. 
Also during his term as San Joaquin County 
Office of Education Superintendent, Mick served as an environmental steward for schools by designing a cutting edge Solar Parking Lot linked to the SJCOE Clean Trans-portation Technologies Academy and New En-ergy Academy funded by a partnership be-tween PG&E, SJCOE, and California Depart-ment of Education. Its curriculum is devoted to renewable energy and green technology topics with the goal of giving students a foundation for college and jobs in the clean tech industry. 
Superintendent Founts was instrumental in 
the formation of the County’s career academy concept that will prepare kids for work and col-lege. His vision created a state-of-the-art ca-reer and technical education facility along with regional occupational programs and centers such as Career Academy of Cosmetology. In addition, through SJ Building Futures Acad-emy and SJ Regional Conservation Corps, he helped give young adults viable work skills as well as keeping them off the street by pro-viding a second chance at a high school di-ploma. 
Like his taste for variety in education, Mick 
also enjoys an array of hobbies. In addition to his career in education, he is a ranch owner and farmer for his family’s South African Boer Goat business Biggy Farms and regularly competes in National livestock shows. Mick played and coached both high school and col-lege football and continues to enjoy sports. He can often be found at a local football or bas-ketball game. Mick was raised in a musical family and played in bands during his younger years. He continues to play the guitar for his own enjoyment and has an appreciation for many different musical styles. He also has a love for Victorian homes and he and his family have enjoyed restoring one on their own prop-erty. 
Mick’s impact on students covers many 
years and it is not unusual to hear grown men refer to him as ‘‘coach’’ to this day. Previous students often call his office or stop by to share that they would not be where they are today had it not been for his influence. When Mick retires at the end of his term, he leaves a legacy that spans many generations. 
Mr. Speaker, please join me in honoring and 
commending the outstanding contributions made to education and the San Joaquin com-munity by Superintendent Mick Founts and

INTRODUCTION OF TWO 
CORPORATE CRIME BILLS 
HON. JOHN CONYERS, JR. 
OF MICHIGAN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 
Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, today, I am in-
troducing two bills to help hold accountable corporations who market dangerous products and who violate the law. We rely on corpora-tions to provide necessary goods and services to consumers and to provide jobs for our citi-zens. Unfortunately, sometimes corporations engage in acts that may harm us or that other-wise run afoul of the law. That is why I am in-troducing these measures. 
The Dangerous Products Warning Act con-
cerns businesses who learn that products they are marketing are dangerous but who do not inform the appropriate federal agency or warn the public. 
It amends the federal criminal code to im-
pose a fine and/or prison term of up to 5 years on any business entity or product supervisor 
with respect to a product or business practice who knows of a serious danger associated with such product or business practice and knowingly fails within 15 days after discovering such danger to inform an appropriate federal agency in writing, warn affected employees in writing, and inform other affected individuals. The bill imposes a fine and/or prison term of up to 1 year on any individual who inten-tionally discriminates against an employee who informs a federal agency or warns em-ployees of a serious danger associated with a product or business practice. 
The Corporate Crime Database Act deals 
with the concern that the public has inad-equate means of learning about the degree to which companies are engaging in acts in vio-lation of the law, and sets up a mechanism to track such violations and make the information available to the public. 
The bill directs the Attorney General to: (1) 
acquire data, for each calendar year, regard-ing all administrative, civil, and criminal judicial proceedings against any corporation or cor-porate official involving a felony or mis-demeanor or civil charge where potential fines may be $1,000 or more; (2) establish and maintain a publicly available website on im-proper conduct by all corporations with annual revenues of more than $1 billion; and (3) pre-pare an annual report to Congress detailing the number of civil, administrative, and crimi-nal enforcement actions brought against any corporation or corporate official and the final dispositions of such actions. 
With the enactment of these two bills, we 
would take important steps toward protecting our citizens from harm and empowering them to know which corporations are violating our laws. TRIBUTE TO MAJOR JACOB 
‘‘JAKE’’ A. WHITESIDE FOR EX-CEPTIONAL SERVICE TO THE UNITED STATES ARMY 
HON. PETER J. VISCLOSKY 
OF INDIANA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 
Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay 
tribute to Major Jacob ‘‘Jake’’ A. Whiteside for his dedication to duty and service as a De-fense Legislative Fellow. Major Whiteside will be transitioning from his present assignment with my office to serve as the Executive Offi-cer for the 12th Aviation Battalion, United States Army. 
A native of Memphis, Tennessee, Major 
Whiteside was accepted into the Carson-New-man University Reserve Officer Training Corps program in 1999, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts Degree in English Literature and grad-uated as a Distinguished Military Graduate with the class of 2003. Upon graduation, Jake was commissioned as an Army Aviation Branch Officer. He has subsequently earned a Master’s degree in Legislative Affairs from the George Washington University. 
Prior to entering the Army Congressional 
Fellowship Program, Jake served in numerous tactical leadership and staff assignments as an Army Aviation Branch Officer, and Scout/ Attack OH–58 helicopter Pilot. Major Whiteside’s assignments include Flight School Student, United States Army Aviation Center of Excellence, Fort Rucker; Flight Platoon Leader, 1st Battalion (Attack), 82nd Combat Aviation Brigade, Fort Bragg; Future Oper-ations and Current Operations Officer, 1st Squadron, 17th CAV, Fort Bragg; Head-quarters Troop Commander, 1st Squadron, 17th CAV, Fort Bragg; Student, Army Aviation Captain’s Career Course, Army Aviation Cen-ter of Excellence, Fort Rucker; and most re-cently Aviation Branch Representative, United States Military Academy, West Point. Addition-ally, Major Whiteside was deployed in direct support of combat operations in Mosul, Iraq, in 2006–2007, and Regional Command—South, Afghanistan, in 2009–2010. While deployed, Jake accumulated over 500 hours of combat flight time in direct support of soldiers in the fight. 
Throughout his career, Major Whiteside has 
positively impacted his soldiers, peers, and su-periors. Our country has been enriched by his extraordinary leadership, thoughtful judgment, and exemplary work. 
As a personal matter, in his role as Defense 
Legislative Fellow, Jake provided me with can-did advice and became a trusted source of counsel to me, my personal staff, and com-mittee staff. Blessed with a sterling intellect and nimble mind, he vigorously and effectively addressed any challenging task placed before him. Further, his incomparable work ethic, poise under pressure, and generosity will be sorely missed. To put it simply, Major Whiteside’s performance has set a standard on which I will evaluate all future Congres-sional Fellows. 
Mr. Speaker, it has been a genuine pleas-
ure to have worked with Major Jake Whiteside over the last year. On behalf of a grateful na-tion, I join my colleagues today in recognizing and commending Jake for his service to his country and we wish him, his wife Marci, and boys, Bryce and Gavin, all the best as they 
continue their journey in the United States Army.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 100TH 
BIRTHDAY OF MERCY HIGH SCHOOL BURLINGAME’S KOHL MANSION 
HON. JACKIE SPEIER 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 
Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor 
the Centennial of Mercy High School Bur-lingame’s Kohl Mansion, an historic and beau-tiful building with deep meaning for the com-munity and for me personally. As an alumna of Mercy High and the mother of a daughter who also graduated from this outstanding school, this institution has shaped my life. 
Today, Mercy High School Burlingame, a 
Catholic college preparatory high school, edu-cates 400 young women a year, with the ma-jority coming from San Mateo County. About three quarters of the students are Roman Catholic and 90 percent of the students are engaged in at least one extra-curricular activ-ity. Mercy encourages students to discover themselves and explore their dreams; they re-ceive an education of mind, body and spirit. This recipe and small class sizes prove to be highly successful. In the class of 2014, 87 per-cent matriculated to four year colleges and 13 percent matriculated to community colleges. 
Mercy education finds its origins in Ireland 
in the ministry of Catherine McAuley, the foundress of the Sisters of Mercy. Their work is marked by a special concern for the needs of the poor, in particular women and children. This tradition continues to this day. 
The Kohl Mansion was originally built from 
1912 to 1914 by Charles Frederick ‘‘Freddie’’ Kohl for his wife Bessie. Kohl, born in San Jose in 1863, grew up in a mansion on an es-tate in San Mateo, now known as Central Park. His father had made a fortune as the founder of Alaska Commercial Company and so Kohl Junior was used to an opulent life-style. Freddie and Bessie’s travels to Europe further inspired them to build the lavish four- story Tudor named ‘‘The Oaks.’’ 
In 1924, the Sisters of Mercy bought the 
house and turned it into a chapel. When the sisters moved down the hill to a new building, Principal Sister Mary Lorenzo Murphy and seven other nuns opened Mercy High School in the mansion in 1931, admitting 36 freshmen and sophomores. 
The old Kohl Mansion has embraced tech-
nology and modern facilities. Mercy launched its website in 1999. Over the decades, a state- of-the art athletic center with an Olympic size pool, a commercial kitchen, a new cafeteria and a multi-media center were built, among the many improvements. At every step of the way, the focus of the school was to provide its students with the best education and learning environment possible. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask the House of Represent-
atives to rise with me to honor one of the fin-est high schools in the country, Mercy High School Burlingame on the occasion of the Kohl Mansion’s 100th birthday. May this his-toric building remain the home of education and learning for centuries to come.

INTRODUCTION OF THE ‘‘SHIELD 
OUR STREETS ACT OF 2015’’ 
HON. JOHN CONYERS, JR. 
OF MICHIGAN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 
Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, today, I am in-
troducing an important bill to respond to the crisis that some jurisdictions are facing with respect to hiring police officers and funding programs to enhance public safety. This bill would establish two public safety grant pro-grams. 
Section 2 establishes Shield Police Hiring 
Grants, to be implemented by the Attorney General, to provide grants to law enforcement agencies that operate in Elevated Need Local-ities. An ‘‘Elevated Need Locality’’ is a county (or unit of local government which is not part of a county) which (1) has a crime rate above the national average, and (2) has had budget reductions during the most recent 5-year pe-riod. These law enforcement agencies could apply to the Attorney General to receive funds to hire law enforcement officers, or to rehire officers who have been laid off due to budget reductions. 
Grants would last for three years and may 
be extended by two years at the discretion of the Attorney General. $100 million for each fis-cal year 2016 through 2021 are authorized to be appropriated for this program. 
Section 3 establishes Shield Public Safety 
Enhancement Grants, to be implemented by the Attorney General, to provide grants to units of local government that has jurisdiction over all or part of an Elevated Need Locality. Local governments could apply to the Attorney General to receive funds to enhance public safety in a number of ways, such as pur-chasing public safety equipment, finding public safety programs, making infrastructure im-provements for the purpose of enhancing pub-lic safety, purchasing and installing street lights to deter crime, funding activities related to crime labs, and funding public defender pro-grams. Non-profit organizations operating in Elevated Need Localities may also apply for grants under this program to fund initiatives designed to reduce crime in these jurisdic-tions. 
Grants would be for one year but may be 
extended at the discretion of the Attorney General. $100 million for each fiscal year 2016 through 2021 are authorized to be appro-priated for this program. 
These programs will help enhance public 
safety in jurisdictions facing high crime rates and particularly acute budget issues. The pro-grams would be available to fund the hiring of police officers and the operation of initiatives to address public safety and crime. Programs that enhance public safety will prevent crime, which will decrease the victimization of our citizens and reduce the financial costs associ-ated with crime. That is why this legislation is necessary. IN MEMORY OF GOVERNOR JAMES 
BURROWS EDWARDS 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speak-
er, during Christmas week the people of South Carolina lost a true patriot with the death of Doctor James B. Edwards of Mount Pleasant. The following obituary highlights his love and affection for his devoted family and commu-nity. 
JAMES BURROWS EDWARDS  
OBITUARY  
James Burrows Edwards Mt. Pleasant— 
James Burrows Edwards, DMD, 87, of Mount Pleasant, South Carolina, died Friday, De-cember 26, 2014. Jim was born June 24, 1927, in Hawthorne, Florida to the late O.M. and Bertie Ray Edwards. Both parents were school teachers, careers which led them to St. Andrews, South Carolina, in 1935 and Mt. Pleasant in 1937. 
As a boy in Mt. Pleasant, Jim spent his 
spare time at Ft. Moultrie, home of the 263rd Coast Artillery, and acquired a lifelong love of the military and life at sea. Jim graduated from Moultrie High School in June 1944, and took a job with the Army Transportation Corps as a deck hand on an L–78 tug boat. Though only 17 years old, he joined the Mer-chant Marines in December 1944. Jim was as-signed to the Dogwood, a Liberty Ship con-verted to a hospital ship transporting wounded servicemen home from Europe. Eventually he also served on the U.S.A.T. Bridgeport, the George Washington, and the Larkspur. Jim worked his way through the ranks from ordinary seaman to an officer by age 19, licensed to pilot ships transporting ‘‘any tonnage on any water in the world.’’ 
In 1947, Jim began studies at the College of 
Charleston, while also working as a night of-ficer on ships as a member of the Master, Mates and Pilots Association. During sum-mers, he remained active in seafaring trade, delivering coal to France and England, gran-ite for the Santee Cooper Dam, and general cargo to ports throughout the Caribbean and South America. 
Jim graduated from the College of Charles-
ton in 1951, married Ann Darlington, his childhood sweetheart, and entered dental school at the University of Louisville. Upon graduation, he served two years on active duty with the U.S. Navy in Chincoteague, Virginia, as a general dentist. He would re-main active in the United States Naval Re-serve until 1967, retiring as a lieutenant com-mander. 
After completing graduate medical train-
ing at the University of Pennsylvania in 1958 and a residency at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, Michigan, in 1959, Jim pursued his dream to return to Charleston, establishing his practice in Oral and Maxillofacial sur-gery in 1960. 
While building a thriving practice, Jim en-
tered the political arena, serving six years as the Charleston County Republican Party chairman. An unsuccessful bid for the United States Congress in 1971 was soon followed by his election to the South Carolina State Sen-ate in 1972. Two years later, Jim was elected Governor of South Carolina—the state’s first Republican Governor since reconstruction. Jim served as governor from 1975 to 1979, re-turning briefly to his oral surgery practice in Charleston. 
In 1981, President Ronald Reagan ap-
pointed Jim as Secretary of the United States Department of Energy, a position he held until November 1982, when he was called 
as president of the Medical University of South Carolina. Jim served as president of MUSC for 17 years, retiring in 2000. As presi-dent emeritus, Jim actively continued fund-raising for the MUSC Health Sciences Foun-dation until 2014. 
Among numerous civic and academic hon-
ors, Jim was granted the Order of the Pal-metto for his public service to the State of South Carolina, and is an inductee into the South Carolina Hall of Fame. He served on the Board of Directors of the Harry Frank Guggenheim Foundation, the Gaylord and Dorothy Donnelly Foundation, SCANA, South Carolina National Bank, Encyclopedia Brittanica, Waste Management, Chemical Waste Management, J. P. Stevens, Brendles, IMO Delaval, Inc., Philips Petroleum, Na-tional Data Corporation, Burris Chemical Co., the W. M. Benton Foundation, the MUSC Health Sciences Foundation, and the Communications Satellite Corporation (COMSAT). 
Jim is survived by his beloved wife of 63 
years, Ann; his son, James B. Edwards, Jr. and his wife, Jenny, of Columbia; his daugh-ter, Catharine E. Wingate, and her husband, Ken, of Columbia; grandchildren, Miriam Wingate Ashworth, K. Bryan Wingate, Jr., Ansley Darlington Edwards, James B. Edwards, III, Catharine Paxson Wingate, and Hellen Tucker Edwards; one great-grand-child, Eliza Ann Wingate, and numerous nephews and nieces. In addition to his par-ents, Jim was preceded in death by his sister, Josephine E. Pinckney, his brother, Dr. Mor-ton Thomas Edwards, his sisters, Ada Frances E. Melchers and Jane Ann E. Varn. 
Visitation will be from 5:30 until 7:30 p.m. 
on Sunday, December 28, 2014 at St. Luke’s Chapel, on the Campus of the Medical Uni-versity of South Carolina. The funeral serv-ice will be conducted at St. Philip’s Church at 1:00 p.m. on Monday, December 29, 2014 by The Rt. Rev’d. Dr. C. FitzSimons Allison. In-terment will follow in the churchyard of Christ Church, Mt. Pleasant, after which the family will receive visitors in the parish hall of Christ Church. 
The family requests, in lieu of flowers,

FORMER S.C. G OV. JAMES EDWARDS SUCCUMBS  
TOSTROKE  
(By Hal Millard) 
James B. Edwards, the state’s first GOP 
governor since Reconstruction, has died. 
He was 87. Edwards, a dentist by trade who in 1974 be-
came the first Republican governor in South Carolina since 1876, died Dec. 26 at his Mount Pleasant home from complications caused by a stroke. 
Politicians throughout the state mourned 
his passing. 
Expressing her sympathy, Gov. Nikki 
Haley wrote on Facebook that Edwards ‘‘ap-preciated the opportunities and challenges of this office.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E15 January 6, 2015 
‘‘Governor Edwards always offered kind 
words of support and encouragement—and we are forever grateful for his friendship,’’ Haley wrote. ‘‘Michael and I are deeply sad-dened by the passing of Governor Edwards, whose love for South Carolina inspired him to serve until his last day . . .’’ 
GOP Congressman Joe Wilson of Spring-
dale echoed those sentiments and added, ‘‘I am grateful to have had a lifetime of work-ing with Dr. Jim Edwards, and the honor of knowing his wife Anne, daughter Cathy, and son Jim. Dr. Edwards was a tireless stalwart for conservative limited government to ex-pand freedom. 
‘‘In high school, I would visit his dental of-
fice for Goldwater materials, in his capacity as Charleston County Republican Chair-man,’’ Wilson continued. ‘‘In 1974, he coura-geously ran and was elected as South Caro-lina’s first Republican governor. At that time, I worked with him on the State Devel-opment Board, where he recruited Michelin Tire Corporation to produce job opportuni-ties for our citizens. I was honored to serve him in the visionary Reagan Administration as Deputy General Counsel as he achieved success in deregulation as Secretary of En-ergy. 
Wilson also hailed Edwards’ 17-year tenure 
as president of the Medical University of South Carolina. 
‘‘His return to Charleston as president of 
the Medical University of South Carolina re-sulted in MUSC becoming recognized for world-class universities,’’ Wilson said. ‘‘South Carolina has lost a Southern Gen-tleman, devoted dad and grandfather, who has made a difference as a key architect for a political revolution.’’ 
Wilson noted that Edwards’ 
groundbreaking win in 1974 was a precursor to the current Republican dominance in the Deep South. 
‘‘Dr Edwards’ vision of an inclusive Repub-
lican Party came to fulfillment [in Decem-ber] with the U.S. Senate victory in Lou-isiana, from his start with no elected state-wide Republican officials in the five-state Deep South, and now all statewide officials are Republicans,’’ Wilson said. 
Edwards became governor amid the tur-
moil of the Watergate years and was one of the few GOP bright spots in an election year in which Democrats dominated. A long-shot candidate who had previously served two years as a state senator from Charleston County, Edwards defeated Gen. William Westmoreland in the GOP primary, then upset long-time Democratic Congressman William Jennings Bryan Dorn in the general election. 
Edwards served in an era when governors 
were prohibited from serving consecutive terms. Following his term as governor, Edwards was nominated as President Ronald Reagan’s Energy Secretary; serving two years in that role before resigning to become president of MUSC.

Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I submit the 
following. 
SUMMARY  
Throughout our Nation’s history, hard-
working American men and women have la-bored to make our businesses become the most productive and dynamic in the world. 
Unfortunately, when some of these busi-nesses encounter financial difficulties and seek to reorganize their debts under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, these very same workers and retirees are often asked to make major sacrifices through lost job protections, lower wages, and the elimination of hard- won pension and health benefits, while the executives and managers of these business are not required to make comparable sac-rifices. 
We must do more to ensure that America’s 
most important resource—workers and retir-ees—are treated more fairly when these busi-ness seek to reorganize their financial affairs under the protection of our bankruptcy laws. The Protecting Employees and Retirees in Business Bankruptcies Act of 2015 accom-plishes this goal by amending the Bank-ruptcy Code in several respects. First, it im-proves recoveries for employees and retirees by: (1) increasing the amount of worker claims entitled to priority payment for un-paid wages and contributions to employee benefit plans up to $20,000; (2) eliminating the difficult to prove restriction in current law that wage and benefit claims must be earned within 180 days of the bankruptcy fil-ing in order to be entitled to priority pay-ment; (3) allowing employees to assert claims for losses in certain defined contribu-tion plans when such losses result from em-ployer fraud or breach of fiduciary duty; (4) establishing a new priority administrative expense for workers’ severance pay; and (5) clarifying that back pay awards for WARN Act damages are entitled to the same pri-ority as back pay for other legal violations. 
Second, the legislation reduces employees’ 
and retirees’ losses by: (1) restricting the conditions under which collective bargaining agreements and commitments to fund re-tiree pensions and health benefits may be eliminated or adversely affected; (2) pre-venting companies from singling out non- management retirees for concessions; (3) re-quiring a court to consider the impact a bid-der’s offer to purchase a company’s assets would have on maintaining existing jobs and preserving retiree pension and health bene-fits; and (4) clarifying that the principal pur-pose of Chapter 11 bankruptcy is the preser-vation of jobs to the maximum extent pos-sible 
Third, the bill restricts excessive executive 
compensation programs by: (1) requiring full disclosure and court approval of executive compensation packages; (2) restricting the payment of bonuses and other forms of in-centive compensation to senior officers and others; and (3) ensuring that insiders cannot receive retiree benefits if workers have lost their retirement or health benefits. 
This legislation is identical to H.R. 100, in-
troduced in the 113th Congress, and H.R. 6117, introduced in the 112th Congress. It is sup-ported by the AFL-CIO and many of its larg-est affiliates, and the United Steelworkers. 
SECTION -BY-SECTION EXPLANATION OF THE BILL  
Sec. 1. Short Title. Section 1 sets forth the 
short title of the bill as the ‘‘Protecting Em-ployees and Retirees in Business Bank-ruptcies Act of 2015.’’ It also includes a table of contents for the bill. 
Sec. 2. Findings. Section 2 sets forth various 
findings in support of this bill. 
TITLE I —IMPROVING RECOVERIES FOR  
EMPLOYEES AND RETIREES  
Sec. 101. Increased Wage Priority. Bank-
ruptcy Code section 507 accords priority in payment status for certain types of claims, i.e., these priority claims must be paid in full in the order of priority before general unsecured claims may be paid. Section 507(a)(4) accords a fourth level priority to an unsecured claim up to $10,000 owed to an in-dividual for wages, salaries, or commissions 
(including vacation, severance, and sick leave pay) earned within the 180-day period preceding the filing of the bankruptcy case or the date on which the debtor’s business ceased, whichever occurs first. Section 101 amends section 507(a)(4) to increase the amount of the priority to $20,000 and elimi-nate the 180–day reachback limitation. 
Bankruptcy Code section 507(a)(5) accords 
a fifth level priority for unsecured claims for contributions to an employee benefit plan arising from services rendered within the l80- day period preceding the filing of the bank-ruptcy case or the date on which the debtor’s business ceased (whichever occurs first). The amount of the claim is based on the number of employees covered by the plan multiplied by $10,000, less the aggregate amount paid to 
such employees pursuant to section 507(a)(4) and the aggregate amount paid by the estate on behalf of such employees to any other em-ployee benefit plan. Section 101 amends Bankruptcy Code section 507(a)(5) to: (1) in-crease the priority amount to $20,000; (2) eliminate the offset requirements; and (3) eliminate the 180-day limitation. 
Sec. 102. Claim for Stock Value Losses in De-
fined Contribution Plans. Section 102 amends 
the Bankruptcy Code’s definition of a claim to include a right or interest in equity secu-rities of the debtor (or an affiliate of the debtor) held in a defined contribution plan for the benefit of an individual who is not an insider, senior executive officer or one of the 20 next most highly compensated employees of the debtor (if one or more are not insid-ers), providing: (1) such securities were at-tributable to employer contributions by the debtor (or an affiliate of the debtor), or by elective deferrals, together with any earn-ings thereon; and (2) the employer or plan sponsor who commenced the bankruptcy case either committed fraud with respect to such plan or otherwise breached a duty to the participant that proximately caused the loss of value. 
Sec. 103. Priority for Severance Pay. Bank-
ruptcy Code section 503(b) establishes an ad-ministrative expense payment priority for certain types of unsecured claims. Among all types of unsecured claims, administrative expenses are accorded the highest payment priority, i.e., they must be paid in full before priority and general unsecured claims may be paid. Section 103 amends section 503(b) to accord administrative expense priority for severance pay owed to the debtor’s employ-ees (other than an insider, other senior man-agement, or a consultant retained to provide services to the debtor) under a plan, program or policy generally applicable to the debtor’s employees (but not under an individual con-tract of employment) or owed pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement for termi-nation or layoff on or after the date the bankruptcy case was filed. Such pay is deemed earned in full upon such termination or layoff. 
Sec. 104. Financial Returns for Employees and 
Retirees. Bankruptcy Code section 1129(a) 
specifies various criteria that must be satis-fied before a chapter 11 plan of reorganiza-tion may be confirmed. Section 104 amends section 1129(a) to add a further requirement. The plan must provide for the recovery of damages for the rejection of a collective bar-gaining agreement or for other financial re-turns as negotiated by the debtor and the au-thorized representative under section 1113 to the extent such returns are paid under, rath-er than outside of a plan. 
Section 104 also replaces Bankruptcy Code 
section 1129(a)(13), which pertains to the pay-ment of retiree benefits under section 1114. As revised, section 1129(a)(13) requires a plan to provide for the continuation after the plan’s effective date of the payment of all re-tiree benefits at the level established under

either section 1114(e)(1)(B) or (g) at any time 
prior to confirmation of the plan, for the du-ration of the period for which the debtor has obligated itself to provide such benefits. If no modifications are made prior to confirma-tion of the plan, the plan must provide for the continuation of all retiree benefits main-tained or established in whole or in part by the debtor prior to the petition filing date. In addition, the plan must provide for recov-ery of claims arising from the modification of retiree benefits and other financial re-turns as negotiated by the debtor and the au-thorized representative to the extent such returns are paid under, rather than outside of, a plan. 
Sec. 105. Priority for WARN Act Damages. 
Section 105 amends Bankruptcy Code section 503(b)(1)(A)(ii) to provide administrative ex-pense status to wages and benefits awarded pursuant to a judicial or National Labor Re-lations Board proceeding as back pay or damages attributable to any period of time occurring after the commencement of the bankruptcy case. This provision applies where the award was made as a result of the debtor’s violation of federal or state law, without regard to the time of the occurrence of unlawful conduct on which the award is based or to whether any services were ren-dered on or after the commencement of the bankruptcy case. It includes an award by a court under section 2901 of title 29 of the United States Code of up to 60 days’ pay and benefits following a layoff that occurred or commenced at a time when such award pe-riod includes a period on or after the com-mencement of the case, if the court deter-mines that payment of wages and benefits by reason of the operation of this clause will not substantially increase the probability of layoff or termination of current employees or of nonpayment of domestic support obli-gations during the case under this title. 
TITLE II —REDUCING EMPLOYEES ’ AND 
RETIREES ’ LOSSES  
Sec. 201. Rejection of Collective Bargaining 
Agreements. Bankruptcy Code section 1113 
sets forth the requirements by which a col-lective bargaining agreement may be as-sumed or rejected. Section 201 amends sec-tion 1113 in several respects. First, it amends section 1113(a) to clarify that a chapter 11 debtor may reject a collective bargaining agreement only in accordance with section 1113. 
Second, it amends Bankruptcy Code sec-
tion 1113(b) to clarify that no provision in title II of the United States Code may be construed to permit a trustee to unilaterally terminate or alter the terms of a collective bargaining agreement absent compliance with section 1113. The provision further specifies that the trustee must timely pay all monetary obligations arising under such agreement and that any payment required to be made pre-confirmation has the status of an allowed administrative expense under Code section 503. 
Third, it amends Bankruptcy Code section 
1113(c) to require a trustee, when seeking to modify a collective bargaining agreement, to provide notice of such proposed modification to the labor organization representing the employees covered by the agreement. The trustee must also promptly provide an ini-tial proposal for modification. In addition, the trustee must confer in good faith with the labor organization, at reasonable times and for a reasonable period, given the com-plexity of the case, in an effort to reach a mutually acceptable modification of the agreement. Each modification proposal must be based on a business plan for the reorga-nization of the debtor and reflect the most complete and reliable information. As amended, section 1113(c) requires the trustee to provide to the labor organization all infor-
mation relevant for negotiations. If such dis-closure could compromise the debtor’s posi-tion with respect to its competitors in the industry, the provision authorizes the court to issue a protective order, subject to the needs of the labor organization to evaluate the trustee’s proposal and any application to reject the collective bargaining agreement or for interim relief under section 1113. 
In consideration of federal policy encour-
aging the practice and process of collective bargaining and in recognition of the bar-gained-for expectations of the employees covered by the agreement, any modification proposed by the trustee must: (1) only be proposed as part of a program of workforce and nonworkforce cost savings devised for the debtor’s reorganization, including sav-ings in management personnel costs; (2) be limited to modifications designed to achieve a specified aggregate financial contribution for employees covered by the agreement, taking into consideration any labor cost sav-ings negotiated within the 12-month period prior to the filing of the bankruptcy case; (3) be no more than the minimum savings essen-tial to permit the debtor to exit bankruptcy, such that confirmation is not likely to be followed by the liquidation or the need for further financial reorganization of the debt-or; and (4) not be disproportionate or overly burden the employees covered by the agree-ment, either in the amount of the cost sav-ings sought from such employees or the na-ture of the modifications. 
Fourth, it amends Bankruptcy Code sec-
tion 1113(d) to provide that if the trustee and the labor organization (after a period of ne-
gotiations) do not reach an agreement over mutually satisfactory modifications and fur-ther negotiations are not likely to produce mutually satisfactory modifications, the trustee may file a motion seeking rejection of the collective bargaining agreement after notice and a hearing. Absent agreement by the parties, the hearing may not be held ear-lier than 21 days from when notice of the hearing is provided. Only the debtor and the labor organization may appear and be heard at the hearing. An application for rejection must seek rejection effective upon the entry of an order granting such relief. 
In consideration of federal policy encour-
aging the practice and process of collective bargaining and in recognition of the bar-gained-for expectations of the employees covered by the agreement, section 1113(d) (as amended) provides that the court may grant a motion seeking rejection of such agree-ment only if the court: (1) finds that the trustee has complied with the requirements of section 1113(c); (2) has considered alter-native proposals by the labor organization and concluded that such proposals do not meet the requirements of section 1113(c)(3)(B); (3) finds that further negotia-tions regarding the trustee’s proposal or an alternative proposal by the labor organiza-tion are not likely to produce an agreement; (4) finds that implementation of the trustee’s proposal will not: (a) cause a material dimi-nution in the purchasing power of the em-ployees covered by the agreement, (b) ad-versely affect the debtor’s ability to retain an experienced and qualified workforce; or (c) impair the debtor’s labor relations such that the ability to achieve a feasible reorga-nization will be compromised; and (5) con-cludes, based on clear and convincing evi-dence, that rejection of the agreement and immediate implementation of the trustee’s proposal is essential to permit the debtor’s exit from bankruptcy such that confirmation is not likely to be followed by the liquida-tion or the need for further financial reorga-nization of the debtor in the short term. If the trustee has implemented a program of incentive pay, bonuses or other financial re-
turns for insiders, senior executive officers, or the 20 next most highly compensated em-ployees or consultants (or such a program was implemented within 180 days before the bankruptcy case was filed), the court must presume that the debtor has failed to satisfy the requirements of section 1113(c)(3)(C). 
Subsection (d), as amended, prohibits the 
court from entering an order rejecting a col-lective bargaining agreement that would re-sult in modifications to a level lower than that proposed by the trustee in the proposal found by the court to have complied with the requirements of section 1113. 
At any time after an order rejecting a col-
lective bargaining agreement is entered (or mutually satisfactory agreement between the trustee and the labor organization is en-tered into), the labor organization may apply to the court for an order seeking an increase in the level of wages or benefits or relief from working conditions based on changed circumstances. The court must grant such relief only if the increase or other relief is not inconsistent with the standard set forth in section 1113(d)(2)(E). 
Fifth, section 201 amends Bankruptcy Code 
section 1113(e) to provide that during the pe-riod in which a collective bargaining agree-ment at issue under this section continues in effect and if either essential to the continu-ation of the debtor’s business or in order to avoid irreparable damage to the estate, the court, after notice and a hearing, may au-thorize the trustee to implement interim changes in the terms, conditions, wages, ben-efits, or work rules provided by the collec-tive bargaining agreement. Any hearing under this provision must be scheduled in ac-cordance of the trustee’s needs. The imple-mentation of such interim changes will not render the application for rejection moot. 
Sixth, section 201 amends Bankruptcy Code 
section 1113(f) to provide that the rejection of a collective bargaining agreement con-stitutes a breach of such agreement and is effective no earlier than the entry of an order granting such relief. Solely for the pur-pose of determining and allowing a claim arising from rejection of a collective bar-gaining agreement, such rejection must be treated as a rejection of an executory con-tract under Bankruptcy Code section 365(g) and shall be allowed or disallowed in accord-ance with section 502(g)(1). Subsection (f), as amended, further provides that no claim for rejection damages may be limited by section 502(b)(7). In addition, the provision permits economic self-help by a labor organization upon a court order granting rejection of a collective bargaining agreement under either subsection (d) or (e) of section 1113. It further provides that neither title 11 of the United States Code nor other provisions of State or Federal law may be construed to the con-trary. 
Seventh, section 201 adds new subsection 
(g) to require the trustee to provide for the reasonable fees and costs incurred by a labor organization under section 1113, upon request and after notice and a hearing. 
Eighth, section 201 adds new subsection (h) 
to require the assumption of a collective bar-gaining agreement to be done in accordance with section 365. 
Sec. 202. Payment of Insurance Benefits to Re-
tired Employees. Bankruptcy Code section 
1114 sets out criteria pursuant to which a debtor may modify retiree benefits, among other matters. Retiree benefits include pay-ments to retired employees, their spouses, and dependents for medical, surgical, and 
hospital care benefits. It also includes bene-fits in the event of sickness, accident, dis-ability, or death under any plan, fund or pro-gram. 
Section 202 amends section 1114 in several 
respects. First, it amends the provision’s def-inition of ‘‘retiree benefits’’ to specify that 
VerDate Sep 11 2014 09:37 Jan 07, 2015 Jkt 049060 PO 00000 Frm 00016 Fmt 0626 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A06JA8.028 E06JAPT1emcdonald on DSK67QTVN1PROD with REMARKS
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E17 January 6, 2015 
it applies whether or not the debtor asserts 
a right to unilaterally modify such benefits under such plan, fund or program. 
Second, it amends Bankruptcy Code sec-
tion 1114(b)(2), which specifies the rights, powers and duties of a committee of retired employees appointed by the court. As amended, the provision would apply to a labor organization serving as the authorized representative under section 1114(c)(1). 
Third, section 202 replaces Bankruptcy 
Code section 1114(f), which requires a trustee to make a proposal to the authorized rep-resentative before seeking modification of retiree benefits. As amended, section 1114(f)(1) specifies that if a trustee seeks to modify retiree benefits, the trustee must provide notice of such proposed modification to the authorized representative as well as promptly provide the initial proposal. In ad-dition, the trustee must thereafter confer in good faith with the labor organization, at reasonable times and for a reasonable period, 
given the complexity of the case, in attempt-ing to reach a mutually satisfactory modi-fication. Each modification must be based on a business plan for the reorganization of the debtor and reflect the most complete and re-liable information available. The trustee must provide the authorized representative all information relevant for the negotia-tions. If such disclosure could compromise the debtor’s position with respect to its com-petitors in the industry, the court may issue a protective order, subject to the needs of the authorized representative to evaluate the trustee’s proposal and an application pursuant to subsection (g) or (h). 
Modifications proposed by the trustee 
must: (1) only be proposed as part of a pro-gram of workforce and nonworkforce cost savings devised for the reorganization of the debtor, including savings in management personnel costs; (2) be limited to modifica-tions designed to achieve a specified aggre-gate financial contribution for the retiree group represented by the authorized rep-resentative (taking into consideration any labor cost savings negotiated within the 12- month period prior to the filing of the bank-ruptcy case with respect to the retiree group); (3) be no more than the minimum savings essential to permit the debtor to exit bankruptcy, such that confirmation is not likely to be followed by the liquidation or the need for further financial reorganization of the debtor; and (4) not be disproportionate or overly burden the retiree group, either in the amount of the cost savings sought from such group or the nature of the modifica-tions. 
Fourth, section 202 amends Bankruptcy 
Code section 1113(g) to provide that if the trustee and the authorized representative do not reach a mutually satisfactory agreement (after a period of negotiations) and further negotiations are not likely to produce mutu-ally satisfactory modifications, the trustee may file a motion seeking to modify the pay-ment of retiree benefits after notice and a hearing. Absent agreement of the parties, the hearing may not be held earlier than 21 days from when notice of the hearing is pro-vided. Only the debtor and the authorized representative may appear and be heard at the hearing. 
The court may grant a motion to modify 
the payment of retiree benefits only if the court: (1) finds that the trustee complied with the requirements of section 1114(f); (2) considered any of the authorized representa-tive’s alternative proposals and determined that such proposals do not meet the require-ments of section 1114(f)(3)(B); (3) finds that further negotiations are not likely to produce a mutually satisfactory agreement; (4) finds that implementation of the trustee’s proposal will not cause irreparable harm to the affected retirees; and (5) concludes that, 
based on clear and convincing evidence, an order granting the trustee’s proposal and its immediate implementation is essential to permit the debtor’s exit from bankruptcy such that confirmation is not likely to be followed by the liquidation or the need for further financial reorganization of the debt-or in the short term. 
If the trustee has implemented a program 
of incentive pay, bonuses, or other financial returns for insiders, senior executive offi-
cers, or the 20 next most highly compensated employees or consultants (or such program was implemented within 180 days before the bankruptcy case was filed), the court must presume that the debtor failed to satisfy the requirements of section 1114(f)(3)(C). 
Fifth, section 202 strikes subsection (k) 
and makes conforming revisions. 
Sec. 203 Protection of Employee Benefits in a 
Sale of Assets. Section 203 amends Bank-
ruptcy Code section 363(b), which authorizes a debtor to sell or use property of the estate other than in the ordinary course of business (under certain circumstances), to add a new requirement. New section 365(b)(3) requires the court, in approving a sale, to consider the extent to which a bidder’s offer: (1) main-tains existing jobs; (2) preserves terms and conditions of employment, and (3) assumes or matches pension and retiree benefit obli-gations in determining whether such offer constitutes the highest or best offer for the property. 
Sec. 204. Claim for Pension Losses. Section 
204 adds a new subsection to Bankruptcy Code section 502, which pertains to the al-lowance of claims and interests. New sub-section (1) requires the court to allow a claim by an active or retired participant (or by a labor organization representing such participants) in a defined benefit pension plan terminated under section 4041 or 4042 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) for any shortfall in pen-sion benefits accrued as of the effective date of the pension plan’s termination as a result of such termination and limitations upon the payment of benefits imposed pursuant to sec-tion 4042 of such Act, notwithstanding any claim asserted and collected by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation with respect to such termination. 
In addition, section 204 adds subsection (m) 
to Bankruptcy Code section 502 to require a court to allow a claim described in Bank-ruptcy Code section 101(5)(C) (as amended by this legislation) by an active or retired par-ticipant (or a labor union representing such participant) in a defined contribution plan (within the meaning of section 3(34) of ERISA). The amount of such claim must be measured by the market value of the stock at the time of contribution to, or purchase by, the plan and the value as of the com-mencement of the case. 
Sec. 205. Payments by Secured Lender. Bank-
ruptcy Code section 506(c) authorizes the debtor to recover from property securing an allowed secured claim the reasonable and necessary expenses incurred to preserve or dispose of such property to the extent the se-cured creditor benefits from such expendi-tures. Section 205 amends section 506(c) to add a new provision. As amended, section 506(c) deems unpaid wages, accrued vacation, severance or other benefits owed under the debtor’s policies and practices or owed pur-suant to a collective bargaining agreement, for services rendered on and after commence-ment of the case to be necessary costs and expenses of preserving or disposing of prop-erty securing an allowed secured claim. Such obligations must be recovered even if the trustee has otherwise waived the provisions of section 506(c) pursuant to an agreement with the allowed secured claimant or a suc-cessor or predecessor in interest. Sec. 206. Preservation of Jobs and Benefits. 
Section 206 adds a statement of purpose to chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code specifying that a chapter 11 debtor must have as its principal purpose the reorganization of its business to preserve going concern value to the maximum extent possible through the productive use of its assets and the preserva-tion of jobs that will sustain productive eco-nomic activity. 
In addition, section 206 amends Bank-
ruptcy Code section 1129(a), which sets out the criteria for confirming a plan, to add a new requirement. New section 1129(a)(17) re-quires the debtor to demonstrate that the re-organization preserves going concern value to the maximum extent possible through the productive use of the debtor’s assets and pre-serves jobs that sustain productive economic activity. 
Section 206 also amends Bankruptcy Code 
section 1129(c), which requires the court to consider the preferences of creditors and eq-uity security holders in determining which plan to confirm. Section 1129(c), as amended, instead requires the court to consider the ex-tent to which each plan would preserve going concern value through the productive use of the debtor’s assets and the preservation of jobs that sustain productive economic activ-ity. The court must confirm the plan that better serves such interests. It further pro-vides that a plan that incorporates the terms of a settlement with a labor organization shall presumptively constitute the plan that satisfies this provision. 
Sec. 207. Termination of Exclusivity. Bank-
ruptcy Code section 1121, in pertinent part, gives a debtor the exclusive authority to file a plan and obtain acceptances of such plan for stated periods of time, under certain cir-cumstances. Section 207 amends section 1121 to specify that cause for shortening these ex-clusive periods includes: (1) the filing of a motion pursuant to section 1113 seeking re-jection of a collective bargaining agreement, if a plan based upon an alternative proposal by the labor organization is reasonably like-ly to be confirmed within a reasonable time; or (2) the proposed filing of a plan by a pro-ponent other than the debtor, which incor-porates the terms of a settlement with a labor organization, if such plan is reasonably likely to be confirmed within a reasonable time. 
TITLE III —RESTRICTING EXECUTIVE  
COMPENSATION PROGRAMS  
Sec. 301. Executive Compensation Upon Exit 
From Bankruptcy. Bankruptcy Code section 
1129 specifies the criteria for confirmation of a chapter 11 plan. Section 1129(a)(4), for ex-ample, requires that certain services, costs and expenses in connection with the case (or in connection with the plan and incident to the case) to have either been approved by the court (or subject to approval by the court) as reasonable. Section 301 amends section 1129(a)(4) to add a requirement that pay-ments or other distributions under the plan to or for the benefit of insiders, senior execu-tive officers, and any of the 20 next most highly compensated employees or consult-ants providing services to the debtor may not be approved unless: (1) such compensa-tion is subject to review under section 1129(a)(5), or (2) such compensation is in-cluded as part of a program of payments or distributions generally applicable to the debtor’s employees and only to the extent that the court determines that such pay-ments are not excessive or disproportionate as compared to distributions to the debtor’s nonmanagement workforce. 
In addition, section 301 amends section 
1129(a)(5), which requires the plan proponent to disclose the identity and affiliations of the debtor’s officers and others, such as the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E18 January 6, 2015 
identity of any insider who will be employed 
or retained by the reorganized debtor and such insider’s compensation. Section 301 amends section 1129(a)(5) to add a require-ment that such compensation must be ap-proved (or subject to approval) by the court in accordance with the following criteria: (1) the compensation is reasonable when com-pared to that paid to individuals holding 
comparable positions at comparable compa-nies in the same industry; and (2) the com-pensation is not disproportionate in light of economic concessions by the debtor’s non-management workforce during the case. 
Sec. 302. Limitations on Executive Compensa-
tion Enhancements . In general, Bankruptcy 
Code Section 503(c) prohibits a debtor from making certain payments to an insider, ab-sent certain findings by the court. Section 302 amends section 503(c)(1), which prohibits such payments when they are intended to in-duce the insider to remain with the debtor’s business, in several respects. First, it ex-pands the provision so that it applies a debt-or’s senior executive officer and any of the debtor’s 20 next most highly compensated employees or consultants. Second, it clari-fies that the provision prohibits the payment of performance or incentive compensation, a bonus of any kind, and other financial re-turns designed to replace or enhance incen-tive, stock, or other compensation in effect prior to the commencement of the case. And, third, it specifies that the court’s findings must be based on clear and convincing evi-
dence in the record. 
In addition, section 302 also amends Bank-
ruptcy Code section 503(c)(3), which prohibits other transfers made or obligations incurred outside of the debtor’s ordinary course of business and not justified by the facts and circumstances of the case, including trans-fers made and obligations incurred for the benefit of the debtor’s officers, managers or consultants hired postpetition. Section 302 replaces section 503(c)(3) with a provision prohibiting other transfers or obligations in-curred to or for the benefit of insiders, senior executive officers, managers or consultants providing services to the debtor unless they meet certain criteria. First, the court must find, based on clear and convincing evidence (without deference to the debtor’s request for authorization to make such payments), that such payments are essential to the sur-vival of the debtor’s business or, in the case of a liquidation, essential to the orderly liq-uidation of the debtor’s business and maxi-mization of the value of the debtor’s assets. Second, the services for which compensation is sought must be essential in nature. Third, such payments must be reasonable compared to individuals holding comparable positions at comparable companies in the same indus-try and not disproportionate in light of eco-nomic concessions made by the debtor’s non-management workforce during the case. 
Sec. 303. Assumption of Executive Retirement 
Plans . Section 303 amends Bankruptcy Code 
section 365, which sets forth the criteria pur-suant to which executory contracts and un-expired leases may be assumed and rejected, to add two provisions. New subsection (q) provides that no deferred compensation ar-rangement for the benefit of a debtor’s insid-ers, senior executive officers, or any of the 20 next most highly compensated employees may be assumed if a defined benefit pension plan for the debtor’s employees has been ter-minated pursuant to section 4041 or 4042 of ERISA on or after the commencement of the case or within 180 days prior to the com-mencement of the case. 
New subsection (r) provides that no plan, 
fund, program, or contract to provide retiree benefits for insiders, senior executive offi-cers, or any of the 20 next most highly com-pensated employees of the debtor may be as-sumed if the debtor: (1) has obtained relief 
under subsection (g) or (h) of section 1114 to impose reductions in retiree benefits; (2) has obtained relief under subsection (d) or (e) of section 1113 to impose reductions in the health benefits of the debtor’s active em-ployees; or (3) or reduced or eliminated ac-tive employee or retiree benefits within 180 days prior to the commencement of the case. 
Sec. 304. Recovery of Executive Compensation . 
Section 304 adds a new provision to the Bankruptcy Code. New section 563(a) pro-vides that if a debtor reduces its contractual obligations under a collective bargaining 
agreement pursuant to section 1113(d), or re-tiree benefits pursuant to section 1114(g), then the court, as part of the order granting such relief, must make certain determina-tions. The court must determine the percent-age of diminution in the value of the obliga-tions as a result of such relief. In making this determination, the court must include any reduction in benefits as a result of the termination pursuant to section 4041 or 4042 of ERISA of a defined benefit plan adminis-tered by the debtor, or for which the debtor is a contributing employer, effective at any time within 180 days prior to the commence-ment of the case. The court may not take into consideration pension benefits paid or payable under title IV of ERISA as a result of such termination. 
If a defined benefit pension plan adminis-
tered by the debtor, or for which the debtor is a contributing employer, is terminated pursuant to section 4041 or 4042 of ERISA, ef-fective at any time within 180 days prior to the commencement of the case, and the debt-or has not obtained relief under section 1113(d), or section 1114(g), new section 563(b) requires the court, on motion of a party in interest, to determine the percentage in dim-inution in the value of benefit obligations when compared to the total benefit liabil-ities prior to such termination. The court may not take into account pension benefits paid or payable pursuant to title IV of ERISA as a result of such termination. 
After such percentage diminution in value 
is determined, new section 563(c) provides that the estate has a claim for the return of the same percentage of the compensation paid, directly or indirectly (including any transfer to a self-settled trust or similar de-vice, or to a nonqualified deferred compensa-tion plan under section 409A(d)(1) of the In-ternal Revenue Code of 1986) to certain indi-viduals. These individuals include: (1) any of-ficer of the debtor serving as a member of the debtor’s board of directors within the year before the filing of the case; and (2) any individual serving as chairman or as lead di-rector of the board of directors at the time when relief under section 1113 or section 1114 is granted, or if no such relief has been granted, then the termination of the defined benefit plan. 
New section 563(d) provides that a trustee 
or committee appointed pursuant to section 1102 may commence an action to recover such claims. If neither commences such ac-tion by the first date set for the confirma-tion hearing, any party in interest may apply to the court for authority to recover such claims for the benefit of the estate. The costs of recovery must be borne by the es-tate. 
New section 563(e) prohibits the court from 
awarding postpetition compensation under section 503(c) or otherwise to any person sub-ject to the provisions of section 563(c) if there is a reasonable likelihood that such compensation is intended to reimburse or re-place compensation recovered by the estate pursuant to section 563. 
Sec. 305. Preferential Compensation Transfer . 
Bankruptcy Code section 547 authorizes pref-erential transfers to be avoided. Section 305 adds a new subsection to section 547 to per-
mit the avoidance of a transfer to or for the benefit of an insider (including an obligation incurred for the benefit of an insider under an employment contract) made in anticipa-tion of bankruptcy. The provision also per-mits the avoidance of a transfer made in an-ticipation of a bankruptcy to a consultant who is formerly an insider and who is re-tained to provide services to an entity that becomes a debtor (including an obligation under a contract to provide services to such entity or to a debtor) made or incurred with-in one year before the filing of the bank-ruptcy case. In addition, new section 547(j) provides that no provision of section 547(c) (specifying certain exceptions to section 547) may be utilized as a defense. Further, sec-tion 547(j) permits the trustee or a com-mittee to commence such avoidance action. If neither do so as of the date of the com-mencement of the confirmation hearing, any party in interest may apply to the court for authority to recover the claims for the ben-efit of the estate. The costs of recovery must be borne by the estate. 
TITLE IV —OTHER PROVISIONS  
Sec. 401. Union Proof of Claim . Section 401 
amends Bankruptcy Code section 501(a) to permit a labor organization (in addition to a creditor or indenture trustee) to file a proof of claim. 
Sec. 402. Exception from Automatic Stay . Sec-
tion 402 amends Bankruptcy Code section 362(b) to create an additional exception to the automatic stay with respect to the com-mencement or continuation of a grievance, arbitration or similar dispute resolution pro-ceeding established by a collective bar-gaining agreement that was or could have been commenced against the debtor before the filing of the bankruptcy case. The excep-tion also applies to the payment or enforce-ment of awards or settlements of such pro-ceeding.

CONGRATULATIONS TO WAYZATA 
HIGH SCHOOL SWIMMING AND DIVING 
HON. ERIK PAULSEN 
OF MINNESOTA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 
Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to 
commend the Wayzata High School Girls’ Swimming and Diving Team for winning the Minnesota State Championship. 
The title was clinched at the University of 
Minnesota Aquatic Center with a well-rounded team effort that saw eight top-four finishes by the Elizabeth Hansen-coached Trojans. 
Madison Priess led the way with an indi-
vidual State Championship in the 200-yard In-dividual Medley. Wayzata also won the title in the 200 medley relay thanks to strong swims from Carly Quast, Alexis Schaaf, Colleen Donlin, and Madison—coming just short of setting a state record. 
The title was Wayzata’s second in a row 
and was due to the hard work these athletes put in everyday. Swimming takes a tremen-dous effort and practice in order to reach the goals that the Trojans accomplished this sea-son. In addition to the hard work in the pool, these student-athletes have to balance their studies, family responsibilities, and social com-mitments as well. The Wayzata team took all that was asked of them in stride to reach the top of their sport. Family, friends, and fans should all be proud of their effort.
