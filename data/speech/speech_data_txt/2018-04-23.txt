EXECUTIVE SESSION 
EXECUTIVE CALENDAR The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will pro-ceed to executive session and resume consideration of the following nomina-tion, which the clerk will report. The legislative clerk read the nomi-nation of Stuart Kyle Duncan, of Lou-isiana, to be United States Circuit Judge for the Fifth Circuit. RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER  
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-jority leader is recognized. 
NOMINATION OF MIKE POMPEO  
Mr. M CCONNELL. Mr. President, today our colleagues on the Foreign Relations Committee will vote to re-port the President’s choice for the next Secretary of State. It is really hard to imagine someone more thoroughly qualified than Mike Pompeo. His career is a success story on every single level. He graduated first in his class from West Point, served as a U.S. Army officer, and at-tended Harvard Law School. Then came success in business, and then Mike’s neighbors elected him to Con-gress in 2010. That impressive resume explains why, a little more than a year ago, a large bipartisan majority of Senators confirmed Mike as CIA Director. His qualifications were perfectly obvious, and, by all accounts, his track record at the CIA shows that vote of con-fidence was exactly the right decision. He has demonstrated mastery of the daily briefings he both receives and de-livers. His high-quality counsel on sen-sitive matters has won the confidence not only of our national clandestine service but also of the Commander in Chief, and he has returned our CIA to the aggressive gathering of foreign in-telligence. Along the way, he has built a reputation for listening to all points of view, trusting career staff, treating everyone fairly, and acting decisively. In Mike Pompeo, the United States will have a chief diplomat who will enjoy the total confidence of the Presi-dent and is uniquely qualified to rein-vigorate our Foreign Service and rep-resent our interests abroad. It is hard to imagine a better nominee for this mission, at this moment, than Mike Pompeo. I look forward to upholding the tradition of this body and voting to confirm him this week. The Senate will also vote later this afternoon to advance the nomination of Kyle Duncan of Louisiana to serve on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. Mr. Duncan’s legal credentials show that the President has made another outstanding choice. With degrees from LSU and Columbia under his belt, he built an impressive record in litigation, rising to serve as appellate chief in the Louisiana office of attorney general. His accomplishments also extend to private practice, where his work earned the respect of his colleagues and peers, including his opponents in court. A few weeks ago, a law professor and litigator who sparred with Kyle Dun-can in a high-profile case wrote: 
Kyle Duncan is a magnificent nominee for the Fifth Circuit. . . . His confirmation should be supported by all who value judges committed to fairness and scrupulous appli-cation of the law. 
A bipartisan group of current and former State solicitors general wrote to our colleagues on the Judiciary Committee to praise his nomination. Here is what they said: 
As frequent advocates in the U.S. Courts of Appeals, we are well-acquainted with the qualifications and characteristics that make good judges, including intellect, integrity, legal experience, and temperament, all of which Mr. Duncan possesses in ample quan-tities. 
They went on to say: 
We came to know him as a highly skilled lawyer with an easygoing demeanor, and as someone we could routinely turn to for ad-vice and interest on issues of mutual inter-est. Even though we have worked for state Attorneys General of different political stripes, we all agree that Kyle Duncan has the personal and professional qualities that should typify the federal judiciary. 
No wonder the American Bar Asso-ciation’s Standing Committee on the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES2334 April 23, 2018 
Federal Judiciary awarded Mr. Duncan its highest rating of ‘‘well qualified.’’ I urge every one of our colleagues to take his credentials, experience, and bipartisan support into account. Let’s vote to advance the Duncan nomina-tion this afternoon. 
TAX REFORM  
Mr. President, on another matter, in the last several weeks, we have focused on the contrast between the economic policies that my Democratic colleagues favor and the policies this Republican President and Republican Congress have put into effect. Under nearly a decade of Democratic leadership, the American people saw slow and insufficient growth. For most workers in most industries, significant wage growth was nearly nonexistent; new opportunities were few and far be-tween; and the new prosperity that was created was spread unevenly across the country. Metropolitan areas with more than 1 million residents did OK under Demo-cratic policies. Big cities captured nearly three-quarters of the limited job growth and more than 90 percent of population growth between 2010 and 2016. The rest of America fell further and further behind. Year after year, rural America, suburban America, smalltown America, and small cities across the country saw almost no progress. That is not a record to be proud of, and it is not one that Repub-licans would stand for. That is why we are implementing an inclusive oppor-tunity agenda to get wages, opportuni-ties, and prosperity growing again for all Americans. We have cut job-killing redtape and passed historic tax relief for middle- class families, workers, and job cre-ators. It is delivering results for Amer-icans whom the Obama economy left behind. I hear frequently from workers and small business owners in my State about how lifting these burdens is changing their lives. I recently heard from Senator G
RASS -
LEYabout the good things tax reform is doing in the State of Iowa. In Cushing, IA—population 220—the Anfinson Farm Store is using the new Tax Code to raise worker wages and give employees bonuses. Across the State, the 162 full- time manufacturing workers at Dyersville Die Cast are receiving their own tax reform bonuses. Iowa families will see lower heating and cooling bills, since tax reform is letting the State’s utility companies deliver $147 million in consumer savings. Iowans should be proud that both of their U.S. Senators voted for the historic reform that made all of this possible. South of the border, in Missouri, it is a different story. There, too, tax re-form is a big win for working families and small businesses. From big em-ployers like Walmart to local busi-nesses like Mid-Am Metal Forming, Missouri workers are reaping the bene-fits, but, unfortunately, only one of Missouri’s Senators voted for it. The State’s senior Senator voted on strict party lines to block these historic tax cuts from reaching workers and fami-lies. Maybe my Democratic colleagues still prefer the leftwing policy play-book that funnels jobs and prosperity into the biggest and richest cities but does very little for States like Missouri and Iowa. I am proud of Republicans who are taking things in a different di-rection, and all kinds of Americans are doing better because of it. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. NATIONAL PARK WEEK  
Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, today marks the start of National Park Week. As a fifth-generation Montanan and as someone who grew up in Bozeman— in fact, Mom and Dad moved there in 1964, just a short drive from America’s first national park, Yellowstone—I am very excited to take this opportunity to celebrate the parks that are so very special to so many because, in Mon-tana, hiking, backpacking, fishing, and white water rafting are a way of life. I grew up spending as much time out-doors as possible, and I continue that tradition with my children today. In fact, my idea of a great time in August is to take our dogs, as many of our kids as we can get together—according to their schedules anymore—and take our backpacks and spend several days to-gether in enjoying Montana’s outdoors. As a father, I am grateful to share these experiences with our four chil-dren and instill in them a love for the outdoors. Frankly, what better place to do that and enjoy the outdoors than in our national parks. While Montana is privileged to have two world-famous national parks in Glacier and Yellowstone, national parks are the pride of so many States from Florida to Colorado, to Maine. Speaking of Maine, I am very glad to have partnered with my colleague from Maine in leading this week, as well as with an additional 26 of our colleagues around the country, supporting this resolution. I am pleased we will have the opportunity to recognize the tre-mendous value our national parks bring to so many. As this week begins, I have one chal-lenge for everyone. I challenge you to find time in your schedules and visit a national park. Our national parks are what make us distinctly American. In fact, you can go to findyourpark.com and find the closest park to you. I hope to see all of you out there sometime this year. With that, I would like to turn it over to my colleague and my friend, the former Governor of Maine and now the Senator of Maine, A
NGUS KING, who joins me in leading National Park Week. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Maine. Mr. KING. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague. I want to join with the chairman of the Sub-committee on National Parks of the Committee on Energy and Natural Re-sources, Senator DAINES , to support this resolution which was adopted unanimously last week recognizing this week as National Park Week in this country. When I left office as Governor of Maine in January of 2003, my family and I the next day took off in a 40-foot RV to see the country. My children were 12 and 9 at the time, and we basi-cally circumnavigated America over the next 5
1⁄2months. Just before coming to the floor, I went down the list of the parks we went to. The point I want to make is— and I get a bit emotional about this. This was the greatest experience of my life, to have taken my children to these parks with my wife, Mary; and to have seen and experienced them and experi-enced the people at the parks was just an unbelievable life-changing experi-ence. We went to Arches—I am doing them in alphabetical order, not geographi-cally—Bad Lands; Big Bend in Texas, which, by the way, is one of the most beautiful places in the country and one of the least visited national parks; Bryce Canyon; Canyonlands; Capitol Reef; Carlsbad; the Grand Canyon—of course, every American should see the Grand Canyon. No picture, no movie, no helicopter movie, nothing can pre-pare you for the Grand Canyon; Mesa Verde; Olympic National Park in the State of Washington; the redwoods and sequoias in California; Shenandoah, just a few hours from here; St. John in the Virgin Islands; Yellowstone; Yo-semite; and Zion. These are gems. It has become commonplace to ref-erence Ken Burns’ statement that the national parks are ‘‘America’s best idea,’’ starting with Yellowstone but spreading across the country. They mark our history, they mark our tre-mendous natural resources, and they are just pure inspiration. I hope our colleagues can go, if only for 1 day. If you have 1 day, you can leave Washington and be in Front Royal, VA, in about an hour and a half and go down the Skyline Drive of Shen-andoah National Park, one of the most beautiful places in the country and within a couple of hours of Wash-ington. These parks are near every place. There are so many gorgeous and extraordinary places among this sys-tem. In Maine, we have two—one is a na-tional park and one is a national monument. We have Acadia National Park, which is the fifth most visited national park in the country, and it is enormously important. These parks are not only important to our spiritual well-being and the ability of our people

to enjoy the wonders of this country, but they are also economically impor-tant. Acadia, for example, has about 3.5 million visitors a year. To put that in perspective, Maine has a population of 1.3 million. So almost three times the population of Maine visits Acadia every year. The estimate is $386 million of direct economic benefit to our State, with 4,200 jobs. It is a magnet. It is a national park that draws people into our State, and it is, indeed, one of the most spectacular places in America. I have been there many times. From the top of Cadillac Mountain to the place they call Thunder Hole, it is a gem of a place that is on the ocean. Acadia is on an island just off the coast of Maine. We just had a monument established about 3 years ago called Katahdin Woods and Waters, which is the other side of the coin in terms of attractive places that are important for visitors and are symbolic of the places all over the country. Katahdin Woods and Waters is inland. It is on a river. It has mountain views and forests, it is inland Maine, which represents so much of what our country looked like many years ago. These places are deeply important to our country. I want to join my col-league in challenging all of our col-leagues to visit the national parks. It is not only the physical nature, the physical attraction of a place like the Grand Canyon, but it is also about the people. I will never forget taking our chil-dren to Kitty Hawk on that RV trip. We had a guide who knew everything there was to know about the Wright brothers, and he engaged our kids in a way I hadn’t seen. This was education of the highest sort. The people in these parks are dedicated, they know their stuff, and they make the experience so dramatic and real for all the members of the family. We have work to do in this body. We have a backlog of maintenance on our parks that the Senator from Montana and I are working on, along with Sen-ators A
LEXANDER , HEINRICH , and oth-ers, to try to find a solution to this maintenance backlog. We do have work to do. We are working with the parks to bring their admissions system into the 21st century in terms of online ac-cess for park passes. There is plenty of work to be done. The underlying assets are so magnifi-cent and are so important to our coun-try economically, culturally, socially, and spiritually. I am proud to have joined my colleagues in sponsoring this resolution which was adopted unani-mously. I join my colleague and invite all of my colleagues and all Americans to make it a point this year, as the weather gets warmer, to visit one of these magnificent places. You will be rewarded richly and the rewards will stay with you every day of your life. Thank you. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. ERNST ). Without objection, it is so or-dered. 
NOMINATION OF MIKE POMPEO  
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, ar-ticle II, section 2 of our Nation’s found-ing document grants the Senate the prerogative to confirm the President’s Cabinet nominees. One of those nomi-nees—the current administration’s most important nominee, at least today and this week—is Mike Pompeo, the current Director of the Central In-telligence Agency. Director Pompeo has been asked to become the Nation’s chief diplomat, the Secretary of State, and now filling this post is entirely up to the Senate. The relevant questions couldn’t be graver or more obvious. Do we as a country, with so many longstanding relationships around the world, really feel the need for, the utter necessity of a Secretary of State or not? Do we believe in furthering international diplomacy by filling this post expeditiously or not? Do peace talks—for example, in North Korea— rank among our highest national prior-ities? Do we want to demonstrate as much by confirming Mr. Pompeo so that those talks can proceed, or is this Chamber too self-absorbed in partisan divides to see the much bigger, global picture? It is time to be serious about Direc-tor Pompeo and what this nomination represents. The stakes are high, and the time is short. So why is it, then, that some of our colleagues, all of a sudden, seem to have suffered from sort of a situational amnesia? Take this, for example. Our colleague from New Hampshire said last year that Mike Pompeo’s nomination for CIA Director demonstrated his ‘‘strong condemnation of Russian aggression’’ and ‘‘gives [her] confidence’’ that he can step into this role and effectively lead the CIA. Now she seems to have forgotten those previous positive state-ments. Frankly, it is hard to reconcile what she is saying now about her vote on the nominee for Secretary of State and her vote on the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. Now our friend from New Hampshire says she has deep concerns and cannot support Director Pompeo’s nomination to the State Department. How is it that you support a nomination to be Director of the Central Intelligence Agency—the leader of the intelligence community and an Agency so impor-tant to our national security inter-ests—and then turn around and say you cannot support the nomination for Sec-retary of State of the same person whom you have just spoken so highly about? Well, like I said, it is hard for me to reconcile the differences. Perhaps that would make sense if there were some allegation that Director Pompeo had done a bad job leading the CIA, but no one thinks that. Indeed, we have learned—from leaks, unfortunately— that he traveled to meet with Kim Jong Un, the leader of North Korea, to lay the foundation for the talks that will now occur between Kim Jong Un and President Trump on denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula. I can’t imagine a more urgent, a more dangerous, and a more necessary negotiation than the negotiation between President Trump and Kim Jong Un. Having been in Seoul last September and seeing how close North and South Korea are, it is not just the nuclear weapons that could be put on inter-continental ballistic missiles that we have to be concerned about but the conventional weapons that are laid right there along the demilitarized zone that could literally cause enor-mous loss of life and bloodshed just across the border in South Korea. So I applaud Director Pompeo going, at President Trump’s request, on that clandestine mission to try to pave the way to denuclearize North Korea. If anything, my confidence in Director Pompeo’s fitness to serve as Secretary of State is enhanced by his role as a diplomat, even during his current role as Director of the CIA. Well, people are practically unani-mous in their praise for Mike Pompeo’s conduct as Director of the Central In-telligence Agency. It is public knowl-edge that he has great rapport with the President. When you are representing the U.S. Government to foreign govern-ments, the knowledge that the Sec-retary of State has a close working re-lationship with the President of the United States is the coin of the realm. That is why foreign leaders talk to the Secretary of State and take the Sec-retary of State seriously. Mike Pompeo has earned the Presi-dent’s trust through his hard work and mastery of the intelligence work done at the CIA, and that has been the rea-son why the President now seeks to elevate him to the office of Secretary of State. The objections of our colleague from New Hampshire, and by extension her party, are not about anything sub-stantive. Nobody is pointing to some-thing he did wrong or something they wish he would have done differently as a reason to vote no. They think Direc-tor Pompeo is too close to the Presi-dent and asked whether and to what extent the Director will be able to ex-ercise independent judgment. This is the chief diplomat of the United States, the chief representative of the President of the United States, and our colleagues are asking: How can he exer-cise independent judgment and sepa-rate himself from the person who ap-points him and at whose pleasure he serves? It just doesn’t make any sense. Our other colleague, the senior Sen-ator from California, has come close to saying this very thing. She has said

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES2336 April 23, 2018 
about Director Pompeo that he is smart and he is hard-working and de-voted to protecting our country. This is our colleague from California, Sen-ator F
EINSTEIN , who voted to confirm him as Director of the Central Intel-ligence Agency. She knows a lot about it, having been chair of the Committee on Intelligence here in the Senate, but now she says she senses a certain dis-dain for diplomacy in Mike Pompeo that she believes disqualifies him to be our senior diplomat—the same person who over Easter flew over to see Kim Jong Un to lay the groundwork for this negotiation, which could well save hun-dreds of thousands and maybe millions of lives that would be lost in the event there were military conflict between North and South Korea and the United States and our other allies. Now, like our friend from New Hamp-shire, I admire the Senator from Cali-fornia and enjoy working with her, but frankly I don’t understand her turn-about. Mike Pompeo is thoughtful, careful, and has a remarkable ability to see the world through multiple lenses at once. That is because of his time at West Point, his service in the U.S. Army, and his experience practicing as a law-yer. It is because he has worked as a leader in business and he has rep-resented the men and women of Kansas in Congress. He knows the intelligence community inside and out, not only from his service as Director of the Cen-tral Intelligence Agency but also as a member of the House Permanent Se-lect Committee on Intelligence. He is indisputably smart, and he sees all the angles. That is precisely what will serve him so well when the State De-partment and others work tirelessly to untangle and resolve some of the most intractable of issues—arms control, international security, human rights violations, and religious freedom, just to name a few. Well, what has happened since our friend from California said Mike Pompeo is smart, hard-working, and devoted to protecting our country? What has changed since then? Well, nothing has changed, except for per-haps the political calculation that it is perhaps in the Democratic Party’s best political interest to oppose every one of President Trump’s policies and nominees because that way they stay out of trouble with their political base. One reason Senators are elected for 6 years from a whole State is, presum-ably, that we can get beyond those sorts of parochial political concerns, particularly on matters of such na-tional and international import. Our Democratic colleagues have made it no secret that they are not fond of the President and some of his instincts and decisions, but isn’t that all the more reason for them to not sacrifice rational judgment in the case of this highly qualified and widely re-vered nominee? After all, defeating a Secretary of State nominee would be extraordinary, historically speaking, and it would send a terrible message to our friends and allies around the world. This is nothing to be trifled with. President George W. Bush’s first nomi-nee, Colin Powell, was confirmed by a unanimous voice vote. And his second, Condoleezza Rice, had 85 Senators vote in her favor. Hillary Clinton received only two no votes, and John Kerry only three. Every Secretary of State nomi-nee since 1925 has been reported out of the Senate Foreign Relations Com-mittee favorably. That may change today. This body and this institution should not forget its own history and tradi-tions, and we should not give up on the tradition of bipartisanship, goodwill, and fairness to the opposition. I am proud to support Mike Pompeo as our next Secretary of State and hope that all of our colleagues across the aisle will have the political cour-age to join those of us voting yes. I note that there have been some press releases, some announcements, and a number of our colleagues have stepped forward and said they will vote yes for Mike Pompeo as Secretary of State. I applaud them in their political courage for standing against the tide. For those who refuse—especially for the ones who have flip-flopped in the matter of a year—Mike Pompeo is a human being, a public servant, and somebody well trained and well pre-pared to be the Nation’s top diplomat. I just simply don’t understand how they can reconcile those two polar op-posite positions, or perhaps they can explain it to the American people. I cannot. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, the preamble of our Constitution lays out a vision that includes establishing justice and promoting the general wel-fare. Certainly we have the challenge in America of making sure the doors of opportunity are wide open and not slammed shut. For centuries, we have been working to try to make sure that vision comes into full realization, but today we are considering the nomination of Stuart Kyle Duncan to a lifetime appointment on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. This individual is not supportive of our constitutional vision of open doors; he is intent on slamming them shut— slamming them shut on all LGBTQ communities; slamming them shut on women seeking reproductive rights and healthcare; slamming opportunity shut on those who simply wish to vote in America in fulfillment of the vision of our constitutional democratic Repub-lic; slamming the doors shut on those who are here and have been here le-gally, who are seeking to become citi-zens. Mr. Duncan is probably best known for his work on Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, a landmark case opposing the ACA’s requirement that employers pro-vide insurance coverage opportunity for contraception and for undermining the healthcare of countless women across America. You might say: Didn’t his side of this case win in the courts? Well, not for the reasons that this individual put forward. The Court rejected the argu-ments Kyle Duncan made. He refused to acknowledge the importance of birth control in women’s lives, arguing that the government does not have a com-pelling interest in ensuring access to birth control without cost-sharing. The Court said that is wrong and that the government does have a compelling in-terest. Mr. Duncan argued that the Court was not required to consider the impact of this law—or the possibility of overturning it—on employees under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Every single member of the Court, whether in the majority or in the mi-nority on the opinion, threw out that argument, reaffirming that burdens on third parties must be considered. Al-though the verdict came down on the side Mr. Duncan advocated for, the Court soundly rejected his arguments and his reasoning. After Hobby Lobby, he wrote an ami-cus brief in Zubik v. Burwell on behalf of Eternal World Television Network, a nonprofit seeking an exception from the ACA birth control benefit. He made some of those same arguments again, and again the Court rejected his rea-soning and directed the government and all parties involved to arrive at an approach that ensures that affected women ‘‘receive full and equal health coverage, including contraceptive cov-erage.’’ It is certainly a concern to have a nominee who wants to slam the door shut on the freedom of women to ac-cess the reproductive healthcare that they desire, but there is more door- slamming here than that. He is an ar-dent opponent to equality and oppor-tunity for the LGBTQ community here in the United States of America. He is recognized as one of our Nation’s lead-ing opponents of opportunity for the LGBTQ community. He authored legal briefs opposing marriage equality in Obergefell v. Hodges, going so far as to question the legitimacy of the Supreme Court when the Court came down saying that ‘‘love is love’’ and that marriage equality is the law of the land under the Constitu-tion of the United States of America. He called that decision ‘‘an abject fail-ure.’’ I ask you, what kind of fairness do you anticipate from a judge who is ar-dently opposed to the freedom of oppor-tunity for LGBTQ Americans, who con-demns a previous decision of the Su-preme Court as ‘‘an abject failure,’’ and

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2337 April 23, 2018 
who said that this decision would ‘‘im-peril civic peace’’? He said: 
No one can possibly predict with any de-gree of confidence what are all the possible ramifications for our society that are going to take place. No one could have predicted all of the social pathologies from no-fault di-vorce. This is a far more radical change than no-fault divorce. 
He said that ‘‘harms’’ to our democ-racy from marriage equality ‘‘would be severe, unavoidable, and irreversible.’’ Certainly, he wanted to slam the door on marriage opportunity for LGBTQ Americans, but he made an outrageous argument that the concern of others should enable his court, as he envisioned it, to deprive Americans of the opportunity to marry the indi-vidual they love—no concern for the Constitution, just that some folks might find it uncomfortable. He made an extensive, hyperbolic, hysterical ar-gument that it would completely debase society for people to be with the person they love. His attacks against the LGBTQ com-munity go on and on, from introducing expert declarations in one case that characterized transgender Americans as ‘‘delusional.’’ If you have been char-acterized as delusional based on who you are and whom you love, what fair-ness can you expect from the judgment of this individual? He fought to deny parental rights to the woman who adopted the children of her same-sex partner—the same children she had helped raise for 8 years. Clearly, this individual is interested in rightwing, opportunity-denying leg-islating from the bench, not protecting the vision of opportunity embedded in our Constitution. All that doesn’t even touch on his other efforts, such as his effort to make it difficult for communities of color or communities of modest eco-nomic means to be able to vote in the United States of America. If you be-lieve in the Constitution of the United States, you should be a fierce advocate for voter empowerment and participa-tion, not voter suppression, but this in-dividual is a fierce advocate for voter suppression. Isn’t it right to have peo-ple confirmed to the bench for a life-time appointment who actually admire the vision of our Constitution for op-portunity and for citizen engagement, not one who wants to tear down oppor-tunities and slam doors on opportuni-ties and stop people from voting. That is not all. There is more. There are his attacks on deferred action for parents of Americans in which he spreads false and frightening stereo-types about immigrants, echoing his previous hysterical comments, saying that ‘‘[m]any violent criminals would likely be eligible to receive deferred action under DAPA’s inadequate stand-ards.’’ It is kind of the last refuge of a scoundrel, an individual who proceeds to attack our immigrants, saying: Oh, they might all end up being criminals— completely contrary to the facts, where immigrants are far more law- abiding than the vast average among Americans born here in the United States. Isn’t it the case that we are a nation of immigrants? Unless you are 100 per-cent Native American Indian, then you are here because you immigrated or your parents immigrated or your an-cestors at some level immigrated gen-erations ago. So basically descending to attack immigrants as all criminals is simply another example of this individuals’s unsuitability to serve on the bench. We are a ‘‘we the people’’ nation, founded on equality, justice, and oppor-tunity for all. Our Nation is about opening doors for each individual to participate to the full degree of their talent, not to have the prejudices of some allow them to slam doors on oth-ers. That is why this individual, Stuart Kyle Duncan, should never be on the floor of the Senate to be confirmed as a judge in the United States of Amer-ica. Let him carry on his advocacy out-side the hallowed halls of the court-room but not inside, sitting on the bench. That is why everyone here to-night should vote against confirming this nomination. Thank you, Madam President. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. M
ORAN ). The Senator from Louisiana. Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, I rise to speak to the nomination of and the vote we are about to have on Kyle Dun-can. Kyle Duncan is from Louisiana. He has been nominated to be on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. Let me speak a little bit about his qualifica-tions and why I think we should sup-port his nomination and vote yes. First, I have a little bit of pride in this; he is a graduate of LSU, my alma mater, and graduated from LSU’s law school, the Paul M. Hebert Law School. He graduated in the Order of the Coif and subsequently got a master of law degree from Columbia University. He has the training, experience, and insti-tutional knowledge to be a successful judge. I have discussed his academics; let’s speak about his experience. His breadth of experience makes him a great choice. He was certified as ‘‘well quali-fied’’ by the American Bar Association. He has extensive courtroom experience on the Tenth and Fifth Circuit Courts of Appeals, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, the Texas and Louisiana Su-preme Courts, and he has twice argued in the U.S. Supreme Court. He has ex-perience working in the public and pri-vate sectors and in academia. He pulls from diverse legal backgrounds, includ-ing criminal law, American Disabilities Act regulations, section 1983 claims, healthcare law, adoptions, and con-tract law. He understands the Fifth Circuit. After law school, Mr. Duncan clerked on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals under the Honorable John M. Duhe, Jr. He was the assistant solicitor general at the Texas attorney general’s office and a professor at the University of Mississippi Law School. He is the ap-pellate chief of the Louisiana Depart-ment of Justice. All of these are States included in the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. Again, this is the experience and background we should look for when selecting a judicial nominee. I will also add that he is of high char-acter. Even those who are going to vote no have been impressed once they have met him. They consider him a genu-inely nice man whose body of work is reflective of someone who is decent. His body of work also demonstrates his high respect for legal precedent. He un-derstands that a judge is not an advo-cate for a particular case but, instead, an adjudicator upholding the law, ap-plying the law to the facts. He is a man of high integrity, high character— something sorely needed in this world but especially to be demonstrable in the Federal judiciary. Clearly, Mr. Duncan is a qualified nominee, having that which it takes to be a successful judge. I recommend Mr. Duncan without reservation, and I urge my colleagues to join in supporting his nomination. NOMINATION OF MIKE POMPEO  
Mr. President, this relates to Mike Pompeo, who is the nominee for Sec-retary of State. If there is one thing everyone in Washington seems to agree on these days—indeed, in our country— it is that we face very serious threats around the globe. From Russian ag-gression in Eastern Europe and Syria to China’s expansion in the South China Sea, to Iran’s increased threats against Israel, to a North Korean dic-tator who likes to fire off missiles and test nuclear weapons, to the collapse of Venezuela, to transnational criminal organizations contributing to the opioid epidemic at home, to trade issues, our country is facing big chal-lenges. As we face these global threats, we need a well-qualified Secretary of State who understands diplomacy and is working to keep our country safe. It is hard to think of someone more qualified than Mike Pompeo. As Direc-tor of the CIA, a former Member of Congress, a top graduate of West Point, and editor of the Harvard Law Review, there are zero—I say zero—questions about his ability. That is what is trou-bling about our colleagues across the aisle who appear ready to oppose his nomination en masse for no other rea-son than that he is a Republican nomi-nated by President Trump. It seems to be the latest example of Washington Democrats kowtowing to the so-called resistance movement, opposing any-thing and everything because they can’t accept that Donald Trump was elected President of the United States. It used to be said that our partisan differences ended at the shoreline; that we presented a united face to the rest of the world. An extension of that is whom we select as Secretary of State. It is worth noting that the previous Secretaries of State appointed under President Obama had overwhelming

support, both from Democrats and Re-publicans, precisely because of the im-portance of having a Secretary of State in place in this challenging world but also, again, because partisan dif-ferences should not be reflected to the outside. In this case, that has been lost in the name of the resistance. When it comes to the critical posi-tion of Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, in particular, would be the man for the job as we deal with Russia, Iran, North Korea, Syria, and other challenges. I urge my Democratic col-leagues to do the right thing for our country instead of catering to the most extreme elements of their party. Most of my Senate colleagues sup-ported Mike Pompeo when he was nom-inated to serve as CIA Director. They should support him now as Secretary of State so we can show the world that while we may have our political dif-ferences at home about any number of issues, we stand united as Americans when it comes to facing threats to our security abroad. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CASSIDY.

CUBA Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, today I wish to address Cuba’s undemo-cratic leadership transition and its im-plications for the Cuban people and U.S. foreign policy. Today, in a highly scripted process, Cuba’s National Assembly replaced Raul Castro, the country’s gerontocratic dictator, with heir ap-parent Miguel Diaz Canel. While this marks the first time in nearly 60 years that a Castro does not occupy the Cuban Presidency, this transition by no means portends the desperately needed political and economic change that Cubans desire, nor does it mean that the Castro regime is no longer in charge. This week’s transition, characterized as a coronation and an attempt to in-stitutionalize the Castro regime, is a ruse. This spectacle does not remotely come close to meeting internationally recognized standards for a democratic election. Cuba remains a single party, authoritarian state that denies its citi-zens their most fundamental freedoms. Some contend that Mr. Diaz Canel could be a ‘‘Cuban Mikhail Gorba-chev,’’ and in seeking to reform the Castros’ broken model, he will stumble into the collapse of Cuba’s communist system. Such thinking fails to account for the fact that Mr. Diaz Canel’s polit-ical ascent was forged under the same Communist Party that has perpetuated the Castros’ decades-long stranglehold on Cuba. More importantly, Raul Castro will maintain his position as the First Sec-retary of the Cuban Communist Party. As article 5 of Cuba’s authoritarian constitution states, ‘‘The Communist Party of Cuba [. . .] is the superior rul-ing force of society and the State . . .’’ Under such a structure, does anyone honestly think that Raul Castro won’t continue calling the shots while his handpicked dauphin occupies the role of President? As this political farce unfolds, I want to make brief observations about three aspects of Raul Castro’s legacy, the state of human rights in the country, the state of the Cuban economy, and the crisis in Venezuela, which Miguel Diaz Canel now owns. Raul Castro will certainly leave an enduring human rights legacy. In the last 3 years, the Cuban Commission on Human Rights and National Reconcili-ation, Cuba’s leading independent human rights organization, docu-mented more than 20,000 arbitrary de-tentions of activists. Moreover, the State Department’s 2016 Human Rights Report on Cuba stated that the Cuban Government routinely denies its citi-zens fair trials, monitors and censors private communications, suppresses freedoms of speech, assembly and press, and employs threats, physical assault and intimidation tactics against its own people. Raul Castro’s economic legacy will be the maintenance of the dual cur-rency system that distorts the national economy and subjugates Cuban citizens to second-class status in their own country. Foreign companies seeking opportunities in Cuba are still forced to conduct business with the military and its vast network of shell compa-nies. ‘‘Independent entrepreneurs’’ are a complete misnomer, as individuals continue to operate in a byzantine sys-tem that prevents them from owning their own companies and subjects them to licensing and tax requirements de-signed to stifle entrepreneurial activ-ity. Additionally, as well-connected members of the Cuban Communist

Party and the military use their posi-tions for self-enrichment, average Cu-bans face a status quo of limited eco-nomic opportunities. As the gap be-tween the ‘‘haves’’ and the ‘‘have nots’’ grows in Cuba, it appears that the Cas-tros’ Orwellian dystopia is a system in which all Cubans are equal, but some Cubans are more equal than others. Finally, looking outward, at the Summit of the Americas last week, where leaders of the Western Hemi-sphere grappled with an unprecedented migration and humanitarian crisis, Raul Castro may have been absent, but the legacy of ruin in Venezuela was front and center. In a July 2017 Senate hearing, Organization of American States Secretary General Luis Almagro described Cuba’s presence in Venezuela as an ‘‘occupation army.’’ While Nico-las Maduro clings to his failed ideolog-ical, military, and economic alliance with the Castro regime, Venezuelans are suffering from food shortages, a collapsed healthcare system, and ramp-ant crime. This brutal reality is the Castros’ legacy for the Cuban people and the hemisphere. In his role as First Vice President since 2013, Mr. Diaz Canel has been Raul Castro’s first accom-plice. So while Cubans will never stop dreaming for a future in which they are guaranteed human rights and are truly free to pursue economic prosperity, they know that Mr. Diaz Canel rep-resents little more than a continuation of the Castro regime. Turning to U.S. foreign policy, to those who would argue Cuba is ready to be a member of the community of na-tions, let me point to the attacks against American diplomats in Havana. U.S. personnel have faced an unprece-dented ordeal. More than 50 unex-plained attacks have affected more than two dozen American citizens, with some cases involving lasting, physical brain damage. Let anyone who harbors doubts about these incidents refer to the Trudeau government’s announce-ment this week regarding incidents af-fecting Canadian officials and changes to Canada’s diplomatic presence in Cuba. These attacks are real. People are suffering. Cuban officials attempting to dismiss these egregious attacks is yet another sign of the disingenuous nature of the dictatorship. Whether the attacks were perpetrated by Cuban intelligence serv-ices or involve the participation of an-other country’s intelligence services, it is unfathomable that a government that prides itself on running a police state would even try to feign ignorance about these incidents. I refuse to ac-cept the premise that members of the Castro regime are not in some way complicit or have no information about who is responsible. The State Depart-ment must continue its investigation of these attacks. The Trump administration must also move beyond Presidential promises to-wards a substantive strategy that pres-sures the regime to undertake serious reforms to advance democratic values and human rights and end its support of failed leadership in Venezuela. First, the United States must remain steadfast in supporting democratic ac-tivists in Cuba. While President Trump claims to support those fearlessly ad-vocating for their rights, his budget proposals tell a different story. Alarm-ingly, his fiscal year 2018 request to Congress proposed zero dollars for de-mocracy programs in Cuba, while his fiscal year 2019 budget only requested $10 million. In contrast to his state-ments, this amounts to rejecting sup-port for the Cuban people and our in-terests. Additionally, as the U.S. Government hones new tools to advance account-ability for human rights violations, we should utilize targeted global Magnitsky sanctions to put a spotlight on the Cuban officials responsible for these abuses. Second, although senior administra-tion officials have been critical of busi-ness deals with the Cuban military that enrich the Castro regime in the process, the regulations the adminis-tration introduced in November 2017 fail to address key elements of com-merce that benefit Cuba’s dictatorship. In the coming weeks, I will launch a congressional review of Treasury and Commerce regulations in order to end unnecessary loopholes that benefit the regime. Finally, as leaders from the Americas and Europe come together to address the multifaceted crisis in Venezuela, they must seriously confront Cuba’s role in Venezuela’s collapse. To date, efforts to coordinate increased inter-national pressure on the Venezuelan Government have given the Castro re-gime a free pass. There was widespread support in the hemisphere for Peru’s decision to not invite Nicolas Maduro to the Summit of the Americas due to the authoritarian nature of his govern-ment; yet no one, including the Trump administration, held Cuba’s dictator-ship to the same standard. It is time for the administration to reverse this trend and call for a coordinated diplo-matic response to Cuba’s longstanding role in Venezuela’s emergence as a failed state. In closing, I urge my colleagues join me in speaking out against the un-democratic political spectacle in Cuba this week. We must join together to pursue a comprehensive policy towards Cuba that pressures regime officials to loosen their stranglehold on Cuba’s economy and political system and that advances the true democratic and jus-tice reforms the Cuban people so des-perately desire.

103RD ANNIVERSARY OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE Mr. REED. Mr. President, this week we solemnly observe the 103rd anniver-sary of the Armenian genocide. Over a century ago, one of the great-est tragedies of the 20th century began when the Young Turk leaders of the Ottoman Empire executed more than 200 prominent Armenians. What fol-lowed was an 8-year systematic cam-paign of oppression and massacre. By 1923, an estimated 1.5 million Arme-nians were killed, and over a half a million survivors were exiled. These atrocities affected the lives of every Armenian living in Asia Minor and, indeed, across the globe. The U.S. Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire during this dark time, Henry Morgen-thau, Sr., unsuccessfully pleaded with President Wilson to take action and later remembered the events of the genocide, saying, ‘‘I am confident that the whole history of the human race contains no such horrible episode as this. The great massacres and persecu-tions of the past seem almost insignifi-cant when compared to the sufferings of the Armenian race in 1915.’’ Clearly, the suffering of the Armenian people must never be forgotten. The survivors of the Armenian geno-cide, however, persevered due to their unbreakable spirit and steadfast re-solve and went on to greatly contribute to the lands in which they found new homes and communities, including the United States. That is why we not only commemorate this grave tragedy each year, but we also take this moment to celebrate the traditions, the contribu-tions, as well as the bright future of the Armenian people. Indeed, my home State of Rhode Island continues to be enriched by our strong and vibrant Ar-menian-American community. This genocide has been denied for far too long. To honor the memory of this tragedy, I have joined with several of my colleagues on resolutions over the years to encourage the U.S. to offi-cially recognize the Armenian geno-cide. As we remember the past, we remain committed to forging a brighter future. We must continue to guard against ha-tred and oppression so that we can pre-vent such crimes against humanity. As ranking member on the Senate Armed Services Committee, I remain committed to supporting assistance to Armenia to strengthen security, pro-mote economic growth, and foster democratic reforms and development. We must find a way to come together to recognize the truth of what hap-pened and to provide unwavering sup-port and assistance to those facing per-secution today. f

CONGRATULATING CONGRES-SIONAL YOUTH CABINET PAR-TICIPANTS ∑Mr. BOOZMAN.

inaugural Congressional Youth Cabi-net, a nonpartisan initiative that has allowed these young people firsthand experience engaging in the democratic process. Students from each of Arkan-sas’ four congressional districts par-ticipated in the program, which pro-vided them with exposure to the legis-lative process and opportunities to seek out advocacy and civic engage-ment. The goal of the Congressional Youth Cabinet is to foster a lifetime commit-ment to civic engagement and public service. I have been impressed with these young Arkansans as they have grown in their knowledge of how our government works and the role that public policy plays in their everyday lives. One project in particular that dem-onstrates this process involved having the participants, grouped together by their congressional districts, develop a legislative proposal of their choice be-tween three issues: driverless cars, an internet sales tax, or rural broadband. The students worked together to craft their proposals on these topics, draw-ing on their own research and back-ground knowledge. I was able to help them refine their ideas and offer my advice as to how they could make adjustments to their product so as to have the best chance of garnering bipartisan support. We also discussed why similar legislation had not successfully attracted enough backing to pass Congress and become law. This program has given these stu-dents the chance to think critically and carefully about how public policy can have an impact on them, their fam-ilies, friends, neighbors, and fellow citizens. I am proud of these Arkansans for taking a proactive step to learn more about how they can make a dif-ference and be a force for good. Their participation in the Congressional Youth Cabinet is something we all can take great pride in. I congratulate them on their hard work and efforts and offer my best wishes for the future. I know these stu-dents will continue to be leaders and doers who give back to their commu-nities. I hope their participation in the Congressional Youth Cabinet is some-thing they can point to as having made a distinct and significant contribution to their development as students and informed, engaged citizens.∑

TRIBUTE TO MARY KAY FORSYTH ∑Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the 100th birthday of Mary Kay Forsyth, originally of Boze-man, MT. She was born in the middle of Main Street under a firetruck on April 24, 1918, and she has been setting off alarms ever since. Mary Kay spent her formative years in Missoula where her father, Clyde P. Fickes, was the head the U.S. Forest Service Region 1 office. Soon after graduating from the University of Montana in 1941 with a double major in journalism and pre-medicine, Mary Kay married professional hockey play-er, Albert J.C. Forsyth of Wainwright, Alberta. They soon moved to Seattle to help the war effort. At the conclusion of the war, Mr. and Mrs. Forsyth and their growing family settled in Coro-nado, CA. Mary Kay spent her life dedicated to the improvement of her community. Her public service and spirit is an ex-ample to others and is admired by all who know her. Mary Kay has a loving family of four children, six grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren. I, along with her family and friends, wish Mary Kay a very happy 100th birthday.∑ f 
REMEMBERING DORIS WARD ∑Ms. HARRIS. Mr. President, Califor-nians and San Franciscans have lost a fearless advocate for racial and eco-nomic equality who became the first African-American president of San Francisco’s board of supervisors. Ms. Doris Ward was elected to the board of supervisors and was sworn in on Janu-ary 8, 1980. In 1991, Ms. Ward became the first Black woman to serve as board president. Ms. Ward was a trailblazer from her earliest days. She attended an inte-grated school from kindergarten through 12th grade. She went on to earn her bachelor’s and master’s de-grees in education at Indiana Univer-sity. Later she earned a master’s de-gree in counseling from San Francisco State University and a doctorate in education from U.C. Berkeley. Ms. Ward was active in the civil rights movement and participated in sit-ins at bars and other public areas in Indi-ana. Ms. Ward began her career as a teacher in Gary, IN, her hometown, be-fore joining the National Association for the Advancement of Colored Peo-ple, NAACP, in Indianapolis. During her time at the NAACP in the late 1960s, Ms. Ward cemented her role as a leader for civil rights and social justice by opposing the Ku Klux Klan and other forms of racism and discrimi-nation before moving to California. Ms. Ward started her political career in 1972, after moving to San Francisco, when she became a trustee for the city’s community college district prior to joining the board of supervisors. Ms. Ward was a friend, mentor, and we will miss her vibrant spirit. The thoughts of San Franciscans and Cali-fornians are with Ms. Ward’s sister, Debra Floyd, of Washington, DC, her family, city leaders, and the people of San Francisco during this time. ∑

TRIBUTE TO JOHN RUHS ∑Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today I would like to recognize and thank Mr. John Ruhs, the director of the U.S. Bu-reau of Land Management, BLM, in Ne-vada, for his work on behalf of our State as he departs his role to assume the top position at the National Inter-agency Fire Center in Boise, ID. Mr. Ruhs first moved to Nevada as a wild horse and burro specialist and later served as Ely’s BLM district man-ager and Winnemucca’s district fire management officer. When talking about the time he has spent in Nevada, Mr. Ruhs said, ‘‘I truly love the re-sources, the people, and the wide vari-ety of activities and issues that we face.’’ He was appointed by Neil Kornze, the national director of the BLM during the Obama administration, to serve as Nevada’s director in 2015, a role he was well-suited for, given his previous pub-lic service in Nevada. For more than 3 years, he was in charge of managing 48 million acres of Federal land in our State. It is a tough job, but he excelled in the role, and I have appreciated the opportunity to work with him. He is a hard-working, honest broker who has a record of successfully and expedi-tiously resolving longstanding issues. John is a leader and a problem solver and was willing to get personally in-volved in even the most difficult dis-putes. Prior to his work in Nevada, Mr. Ruhs worked for the BLM in Colorado, Idaho, and Oregon, as well as in Wash-ington, DC, as the senior special assist-ant. He also worked in Wyoming as dis-trict manager of the High Desert Dis-trict. Mr. Ruhs is also a veteran. He served in the U.S. Marine Corps, and I am truly grateful for his service to our Nation. Mr. Ruhs grew up in Iowa and grad-uated from the University of Idaho with a bachelor of science degree in animal science. He and his wife, Amy, are the proud parents of seven daugh-ters. Together, they embrace the out-doors and enjoy spending time riding horses and camping. As the senior Senator from the State of Nevada, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Mr. Ruhs for his many years of public service to the BLM and to my home State. While his departure is Nevada’s loss, I know that the National Interagency Fire Center will benefit from his expertise. I wish Mr. Ruhs continued success in his fu-ture endeavors and many fulfilling years to come.∑ f 
TRIBUTE TO DIMITRI PHILEMONOF ∑Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I would like to recognize an Alaska Native leader who has dedi-cated much of his life and career to hu-manitarian service in Alaska. Dimitri Philemonof is the president of the Aleutian Pribilof Islands Association, which is a Tribal nonprofit organiza-tion that serves the regional tribes in the Aleutian Pribilof Islands of Alaska. Under Dimitri’s leadership, APIA has had a profound impact on the health and well-being of the Aleut people by providing them with a broad spectrum of services. These services include health, education, social, employment

and vocational training, public safety, and cultural preservation. Dimitri’s tenure with APIA began on April 24, 1978, when he was hired as a training tech for employment assist-ance. Less than a year later, Dimitri was promoted to manpower director and later the community services di-rector. By 1985, the board of directors at APIA would reach a consensus and promote Dimitri to be the executive di-rector and president of APIA, a posi-tion that he has held since. This week marks the 40th anniversary of Dimitri’s hiring at APIA, and I would like to take this time to express my appreciation for Dimitri’s service to the Alaska Native people. Dimitri accomplished many things during his time as the president of APIA, but according to Dimitri, the most important accomplishment as the president of APIA was working to pass the Aleut Restitution Act. It was meaningful for Dimitri because his par-ents were forcibly evacuated from the island of St. George and brought to the Funter Bay Internment Camp during the Aleut Evacuation of WWII. Condi-tions at the camps were horrid. There was no running water, no sewer sys-tem, and no laundry or bathing facili-ties. Most of the buildings didn’t have electricity, heat, windows, or doors. Eventually, Dimitri’s parents were able to return to their home on St. George Island, but they still carried with them the experience of being forced into an internment camp. This was an experi-ence that many Alaska Natives carried with them because they too were put into internment camps, not just in Funter Bay. There were internment camps in Killisnoo, Ward Cove, and on Burnett Island. Fast forward and once Dimitri be-came the executive director of APIA, he worked tirelessly to ensure that the Aleut people would receive restitution for their time in internment camps. He worked with Alaska’s congressional delegation to ensure that Aleut and other Alaska Native people were able to testify before congressional hearing commissions and committees to share their stories and their experiences in internment camps. In 1988, the Aleut Restitution Act was passed, and in 1993, the Aleutian Pribilof Restitution Trust was created. Dimitri and many other Aleut leaders believe that the pursuit for restitution was one of the first steps in the healing process for the Aleut people. Dimitri has had a significant impact on the Aleut people who he represents. He serves as an inspiration to many other Alaska Native leaders. I am hon-ored to recognize Dimitri for his years of humanitarian service, and I wish him many more years of service to his people and to his community by re-minding us all that ‘‘Unganan Ataaqan Akun’’—‘‘We Are One.’’∑

TRIBUTE TO RICHARD W. POGUE ∑Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the achievements of Richard W. Pogue on the occasion of his 90th birthday. Mr. Pogue is a re-spected attorney and community lead-er who continues to this day to work tirelessly to serve greater Cleveland, the State of Ohio, and our country. The impact of his generosity, commitment to the northeast Ohio community where he lives, and tradition of service has touched countless organizations and individuals. I am pleased to recog-nize Mr. Pogue’s over six decades of service today. Mr. Pogue was born on April 26, 1928. He graduated from Cornell University in 1950 and the University of Michigan Law School in 1953. After serving 3 years, from 1954 to 1957, in the office of the Judge Advocate General, U.S. Army, in the Pentagon, he was honor-ably discharged with the rank of cap-tain and joined the Cleveland law firm of Jones, Day, Cockley & Reavis as an associate in 1957. He became a partner in the firm nearly 60 years ago. In 1984, Pogue became managing partner of the firm, which was at this time known as Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue. During the 9 years he spent as managing partner, he led the firm dur-ing a period of unprecedented growth, including taking the firm into inter-national markets. His area of practice has primarily focused on antitrust and corporate takeover work, and he has served as a mediator in a large number of major commercial disputes. Mr. Pogue retired from Jones Day in 1994, only to take on a second career as senior adviser to Dix & Eaton, a Cleve-land public relations firm. He returned to Jones Day in 2004 and currently serves as senior adviser to the firm. Mr. Pogue’s distinguished profes-sional career as an accomplished law-yer and corporate adviser alone war-rants this recognition. However, his caring leadership and dedication to civic engagement is even more impres-sive and has left a lasting impact on countless organizations throughout our community and State. He has served as chairperson of many organizations, in-cluding the Cleveland Foundation, Greater Cleveland Growth Association, Business Volunteers Unlimited, Uni-versity Hospitals, and the Cleveland Council on World Affairs. He is known for his commitment to helping young people, improving our neighborhoods, many philanthropic endeavors, advis-ing public and private sector leaders, and guiding business organizations through changing times. He chairs the advisory committee for the Regula In-stitute at Mount Union University and was a founding trustee of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum. He is a member of the Ohio State Bar Associa-tion Committee to preserve the legacy of Ohio Chief Justice Thomas J. Moyer, the Access to Justice Task Force ap-pointed by Ohio’s Supreme Court Chief Justice, and the Ohio Legal Assistance Foundation. He continues to be committed to higher education and has remained an active contributor to the University of Michigan Law School, which honored him as the inaugural recipient of the Michigan Law School Distinguished Alumni Award. He has served as a trustee of Case Western Reserve Uni-versity, University of Akron, and the Cleveland Institute of Music. As he approaches his 90th birthday, Mr. Pogue is known to rise early each morning, work long days, and engage with community leaders and citizens in a wide variety of endeavors. He is a dedicated and loving husband, father, and grandfather to his wife, Patricia; their three children, Mark, Tracy and David; and their eight grandchildren. He is modest and quietly effective. His kind nature, integrity, professionalism, and dedication to community service has touched the lives of so many and has truly made a difference for greater Cleveland, our State, and Nation. It is my pleasure to recognize Richard W. Pogue and offer my best wishes as his family, friends, and the community he loves gather to celebrate his 90th birth-day.∑ f

DARK MONEY Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for allowing Sen-ator W
HITEHOUSE and myself to con-clude today’s session. I want first to salute my colleague, Senator W
HITEHOUSE , who will be on the floor momentarily. He has come to the floor many times to talk about issues relative to climate change and global warming. He has come on so many occasions that I have lost track, but it shows his dedication to this issue. He has also been outspoken on the issue of campaign financing and what is happening in America today. We all know that it takes big money to run big campaigns, and we all know that many people are put off by politicians who are waiting on wealthy donors to give them the money to make it across the finish line. That is a fact. I have always said that in this busi-ness of politics, there are two cat-egories. There are multimillionaires and mere mortals, and I am in the sec-ond category, never having enough money to finance my own campaign, prevailing on my friends to help. It is too bad that politics has reached the level where campaigns are so long and so expensive. Tonight Senator W
HITEHOUSE and I will highlight one aspect of that issue that is particularly worrisome and really should be front and center; that is, the so-called secret contributions, the dark money—money that is being spent on political campaigns with no fingerprints. It is a growing phe-nomenon, and it is troublesome to think that our democracy has reached that point. I am going to speak about one aspect of it, and Senator W
HITEHOUSE will fol-low me on the topic. I thank him for initiating this opportunity this evening. Let me tell my colleagues what my topic is about. It is one aspect of it. We know that the United States leads the world in medical research. Because of the U.S. scientific community, HIV/ AIDS is no longer a death sentence, polio has been eradicated in this coun-try, people survive cancer and heart at-tacks in record number, and a child born today will likely live to be 78 years of age—nearly three decades longer than a baby born in 1900. Thanks to the U.S. scientific commu-nity, we know the true dangers of to-bacco. Now we are learning about the dangers related to e-cigarettes. But it was not always the case that the dan-gers of cigarette smoking were com-monly accepted knowledge. For years, the tobacco industry claimed to be in-terested in rigorous, independent science. They wanted to sell less harm-ful products, and they wanted to sup-port scientific research. Evidence has now been disclosed which unequivo-cally demonstrates that tobacco com-panies, by funding alternate research and funneling money into front organi-zations to do their bidding, have lit-erally corrupted the science on this issue. They produced products they knew were no less hazardous and sought to influence elections to ensure the friendliest voices supporting to-bacco were elected to office at Federal, State, and local levels all across the country. If this tactic sounds familiar, it should. It is exactly what the Koch brothers are currently doing with re-spect to sowing seeds of doubt about the causes of climate change and help-ing to elect Republicans who are cli-mate change deniers. I have said repeatedly on the floor of the Senate and I will repeat this evening: The Republican Party of the United States of America is the only major political party in the world today that denies climate change. I have said that repeatedly, expecting some Republican to come to the floor and say it is not true. One of them whispered to me in the elevator after I said this a few times: I think there is a party in Australia that also denies cli-mate change. That is the best they could come up with. How did this happen? There was a time when Republicans were the lead-ers when it came to environmental pro-tection. If I am not mistaken, I say to my colleague, I think it was President Richard Nixon who created the Envi-ronmental Protection Agency. When I look back on my own experi-ence in Congress, there were Repub-licans who stood up and spoke up on the issue of climate change. I remem-ber when JOHNMCCAINand Joe Lieber-man were the two lead sponsors on a bill dealing with global warming. It has been within my period of time serving in the Senate, but not anymore. It has changed dramatically. The Koch broth-ers, I think, are behind it. They didn’t come up with this strategy on their own. They were able to look at Big To-bacco’s playbook from years gone by. The first thing Big Tobacco did was to question legitimate science. The Koch brothers got right in line. They have been questioning legitimate science when it comes to global warm-ing, and they pioneered efforts to use dark money to influence America’s public opinion and to sway elections without ever really revealing their true identities or motivations. I look back on tobacco and cancer. I am one—probably, like most Ameri-cans—who has lost a dearly loved mem-ber of my family to tobacco and can-cer. My father died when he was 53 years of age from lung cancer. I was 14 years old. He smoked two packs of Camels a day. It was a horrible death.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2355 April 23, 2018 
He lingered for 100 days in the hospital before he died. It is something you never forget. There is hardly a family in America who doesn’t have a similar story to tell. By the early 1950s, evidence linking smoking and lung cancer was growing. Tobacco companies could have re-sponded by taking steps to protect American consumers. What they did was to launch a conspiracy to chal-lenge the science behind tobacco. In 1953, tobacco companies hired the PR firm Hill+Knowlton to lead a pio-neering effort to discredit emerging science and keep people smoking. At the heart of this strategy was an effort to manufacture a scientific con-troversy by insisting there were two sides to the debate about whether ciga-rette smoking caused cancer. Tobacco companies identified and paid sci-entists who had expressed skepticism about the health risk of cigarettes, who were critical of statistical meth-ods, and who had offered alternative theories of what really was causing cancer among smokers. They also formed an industry-spon-sored research entity that claimed to support independent research. Instead, the organization’s main purpose was to serve the industry’s public relations in-terests—namely, to sow seeds of doubt about the health risks of smoking and not advance science. Does it sound fa-miliar to the scientists sowing seeds of doubt about global warming? As more and more independent re-search found an association between smoking and disease, tobacco compa-nies used their so-called independent research organizations to insist that there was a great deal of uncertainty about whether smoking caused cancer. These entities supported scientists who showed a willingness to generate data and provide testimony that would sup-port the industry. Meanwhile, tobacco- friendly elected officials were happy to accept this bogus, fake science while also receiving generous campaign con-tributions from Big Tobacco. The tobacco industry efforts reached new highs—or lows, if you wish—when, in the early 1970s, there was growing concern about the impact of second-hand smoke. Arizona became the first State to restrict indoor smoking in some areas in 1973 after a Surgeon Gen-eral report mentioned that secondhand smoke could be harmful to non-smokers. By 1981, 8 years later, 36 States had some type of smoking re-striction in place. I know this issue, personally, because as a Member of the U.S. House of Rep-resentatives I decided to offer an amendment to ban smoking on air-planes. At the time, I was opposed by the leadership of both the Republicans and the Democrats in the House of Representatives. Of course, anyone from a tobacco-growing State or from the South opposed my efforts to ban smoking on airplanes. Well, it turned out we had a lucky break here and there in the House Rules Committee and got to bring the measure to the floor of the House for a vote, and I suc-ceeded in passing the first restriction on smoking on airplanes. It turned out the reason was obvious: The largest frequent flier club in America is the U.S. Congress. We spend half of our lives on airplanes, and we know better when people say: You are sitting in the nonsmoking section of an airplane. Everybody was in the smok-ing section in the back of the airplane was puffing away. So that measure passed. I called my friend Frank Lautenberg of New Jer-sey, then a Senator, and said: Frank, can you take this up in the Senate? He said he would, and he did, and the two of us passed the basic prohibition of smoking on airplanes. By the 1980s, evidence had accumu-lated about the health risks of second-hand smoke and, in 1986, the Surgeon General concluded that secondhand smoke causes lung cancer in non-smokers and was associated with res-piratory illness in children. Once again, tobacco companies didn’t accept the obvious. They responded to the evi-dence of harm from secondhand smoke and restrictions on smokers by launch-ing an effort to undermine the sci-entific evidence. They identified, trained, and subsidized friendly sci-entists and sponsored symposia all around the world to feature these sci-entists without revealing they were paying them to come up with these opinions. In 1988, tobacco companies began funding the Center for Indoor Air Re-search. This is after we started banning the use of cigarettes on airplanes, for example. Like the other so-called inde-pendent research organizations funded by tobacco companies, CIAR—the Cen-ter for Indoor Air Research—allowed tobacco companies to fund and control the use of research favorable to their market position so they could continue to sell addictive, cancer-causing prod-ucts to more and more people—espe-cially to kids. To shift emphasis away from secondhand smoke, the so-called research institute supported studies to weaken the case for regulation of to-bacco. Why is it important to reflect on his-tory of 30 years ago? It is happening all over again. Tobacco companies con-tinue to provide funding to third-party organizations that advocate policies that align with the interests—such as e-cigarettes—without ever publicly dis-closing their ties to these tobacco com-panies. In recent years, tobacco compa-nies have sought to advance the idea that bringing to market so-called lower risk tobacco products will actually benefit public health. They warn that overregulations are going to hurt their business. Tobacco companies have provided funding to an array of think tanks—the Heartland Institute, the R Street Insti-tute, the National Center for Public Policy Research, just to name a few. These tobacco industry-funded groups have sent letters to policymakers, they publish op-eds, they write reports, and they issue press releases that mirror the tobacco industry’s position, warn-ing that any future FDA rules will bur-den the tobacco industry and under-mine efforts to bring a so-called lower risk product to market. Many of these groups have historically been silent or opposed policies that have proven ef-fective in reducing smoking rates. Do you know what reduces smoking more than anything else? Cost of the prod-uct. As we have seen States and the Federal Government raise the tobacco tax, we have seen use of the product di-minish. They haven’t supported that, of course, and they don’t support smoke-free laws or mass media cam-paigns. Last year, Philip Morris, notorious as a tobacco company, established the Foundation for a Smoke-Free World. Let me repeat that. Philip Morris, a to-bacco company, established the Foun-dation for a Smoke-Free World. They are going to fund research to end ciga-rette smoking and provide $80 million a year for 12 years. Given their history and their continued opposition to prov-en policies to reduce cigarette use, ex-cuse me if I am skeptical. That is the problem, isn’t it? Re-search from the Foundation for a Smoke-Free World or TV ads or op-eds from the Heartland Institute or the Na-tional Center for Public Policy Re-search just may seem harmless, but if the American public and elected offi-cials knew that R.J. Reynolds, Altria, or Philip Morris—some of the biggest tobacco companies—were behind this research PR, they would be as skep-tical as I am. One more example: corporations and wealthy donors flooding cash into ef-forts to influence the American public and American political officials. In ad-dition to funding bogus research, we know tobacco companies have poured millions of dollars into nonprofit, dark money organizations, which, in turn, spend millions of dollars to influence elections, never disclosing who they are or where the money is coming from. Dark money makes it nearly im-possible to find the true sources behind the attack ads and political campaigns these organizations fund, but some-times, thanks to the news media and transparency organizations, the donors are revealed. In 2013, the Center for Public Integ-rity reported that the tobacco giant Reynolds American, Incorporated, funded several dark money groups dur-ing the 2012 election cycle, including conservative activist Grover Norquist’s Americans for Tax Reform, the Koch brothers’ Americans for Prosperity—a conservative political advocacy group—and the Partnership for Ohio’s Future, an anti-union organization backed by the Ohio Chamber of Com-merce. The only reason we know Reynolds was the secret source is because it was disclosed at the behest of an unnamed

shareholder; otherwise, these donations and the involvement of tobacco compa-nies would have remained a secret. Whether they are quietly funding at-tack ads or the release of supposedly unbiased reports, corporations and wealthy donors are using anonymous, dark money contributions to influence America’s public, casting doubt on le-gitimate science and trying to sway elections without ever revealing their true identities and motivations. It is not just limited to Big Tobacco and their campaigns to turn public opinion against tobacco taxes and smoke-free laws; the Koch brothers have built on this model and expanded the Big Tobacco playbook. They are pushing faulty research in an attempt to obscure the reality of global warm-ing and using dark money to influence our political system. Why would the Koch brothers care so much? They are in the oil business. It is so a rich few can benefit financially at the expense of everyone else if they vote the Koch brothers’ line—and that is at the ex-pense of our children and grand-children. It is time to put an end to dark money influence in elections. I yield the floor to the leader on this issue in the Senate Democratic caucus, Senator W
HITEHOUSE . The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Rhode Island. Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 20 minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I thank Senator D
URBIN , who is a leader in our caucus, but also a very impor-tant leader on these issues. We are here this evening because a group of us now embark on a series of speeches on the Senate floor to shine some light into a network of phony front groups—a web of deceit conceived and bankrolled by the Koch brothers and other self-interested billionaires to advocate for very selfish and unpatri-otic policies. This web of deceit has infiltrated and populated the Trump administration, and it is swamping the interests of ev-eryday Americans. I will not dwell on its policies. The billionaires having to hide behind these front groups tells you all you need to know about their policies. There are plenty of billionaires these days, and a bunch of them do pretty good stuff, but there is an extremist subset trying to quietly remake Amer-ica to their ideology, and they are be-hind the web of deceit. When an issue affects some hyperwealthy interest group, the web activates. In the Halls of Congress, on cable news, in opinion pages, on social media, the front groups will be every-where, with fake news, bogus studies, and phony science. This is a well-studied phenomenon. Two speeches ago, I had a stack of books about this high here on the desk with authors who had written about it. There is also excellent academic re-search by Robert Brulle, Riley Dunlap, Nancy MacLean, David Rosner, Gerald Markowitz, Michael Mann, and many others who deserve credit for shining light into these front groups. The graphic behind us is actually a diagram from the work of Professor Brulle. To the uninitiated, it might ap-pear that these are all actual, different groups and that they might actually represent—who knows—thousands, maybe even millions of real people across America. That is the scheme. These front groups are designed to pro-vide a simulacrum, a manufactured, ar-tificial appearance of public support for ideologies and policies that actu-ally just benefit the richest of the rich or the ‘‘pollutingest’’ of the polluters. Got a tax scam to sell? Call in the front groups who will parrot, falsely, that the middle class will benefit, when it is the billionaires and big corpora-tions that actually make out like ban-dits. Want to block action on climate change and let fossil fuel companies keep polluting for no charge? Quick, activate those front groups to spread climate denial, the original fake news: Climate change isn’t happening; or, OK, maybe it is, but we don’t really know how human activity is the cause; or, OK, maybe it is, but who knows how bad it will really get. OK, really bad, but it is too hard, so let’s leave it to some other generation. Never mind what the real scientists have to say. The web of deceit has fake scientists, and it doesn’t matter to the web if their phony scientists are right or wrong. They couldn’t care less. They just have to keep their fake scientists talking, make it seem like there may be a real question about the science—in essence, pollute the public’s mind. While these phony front groups are out working their PR magic, connected lobbyists and electioneering groups stalk the Halls of Congress, ready to kneecap Republicans who might—like Bob Inglis did—have the temerity to think about acting on climate. More generally, this web of deceit has in-fected the Republican Party with cli-mate denial, all to help polluters pol-lute for free. That is part of the creepy billionaire ideology behind the web of deceit. Of course, a web like this has its stooges and quislings, and in the Trump administration they can get to high places. Imagine if you have been building this web of deceit for decades, and one day you get to plant your phony minions into real, high-level government positions. Oh, what won-derful legitimacy, and what would you not then do to defend your stooges? We just saw this web of deceit spring into action to defend fossil fuel stooge Scott Pruitt, our ethically challenged Environmental Protection Agency Ad-ministrator. You may have seen the steady stream of news about Pruitt’s ethical lapses: huge bills for taxpayers for first-class flights and 24/7 security, even on family trips; a $43,000 Maxwell Smart secret phone booth; a jaunt to Morocco for the natural gas industry; a condo deal from a lobbyist with busi-ness before the EPA; massive raises to cronies from Oklahoma through a loop-hole in, of all things, the Safe Drinking Water Act. He even was caught firing or reassigning people who told him he could not sign up for perks like a pri-vate jet service at taxpayer expense. Talk about lights and sirens. This guy is a lights-and-sirens affront to any concept of decency in government service. As scandal after scandal piled up, pressure mounted to fire the scoun-drel. Never fear, the web of deceit is here. Nearly two dozen phony industry front groups rode to the rescue, urging the President to keep Pruitt on. Here is the letter. As you can see, all these groups’ logos are on it. They praise Pruitt for his work to help fossil fuel polluters pollute. They rejoice that his rollback of fuel economy standards will raise drivers’ fuel costs. They applaud his getting rid of independent sci-entists and putting industry insiders on EPA advisory committees. It is actually the reporting of Pru-itt’s scandals, they write, that is the conspiracy. ‘‘This whole ordeal is noth-ing more than an orchestrated political campaign,’’ they write—‘‘an orches-trated political campaign’’—so says the polluters’ orchestrated political cam-paign to save Pruitt’s political hide. If you want to see something about or-chestrated political campaigns, this is it. The web also went to war in the press and on social media for Pruitt. The so- called Heartland Institute defended Pruitt as ‘‘the single most effective ap-pointment of the president of the United States,’’ and went after Repub-lican Representative C
ARLOS CURBELO  on Twitter for breaking with Repub-lican complicity by calling on Pruitt to resign. Another tool of this web is a front group called the Media Research Cen-ter. They are also on this letter. The Media Research Center’s job, when stooges are caught stooging, is to go on the attack and accuse the journalists of bias. This Media Research Center has a website called NewsBusters de-voted to attacking honest reporting that it doesn’t like. In articles and on Twitter, it attacked ABC News and other networks for reporting on Pru-itt’s expensive first-class travel. Other groups on this letter also took to Twitter to defend their boy Pruitt, including the Energy and Environment Legal Institute, the American Energy Alliance, and the Conservative Part-nership Institute. ‘‘Orchestrated polit-ical campaign,’’ indeed. When I saw this orchestrated ‘‘pro-tect Pruitt’’ letter, it reminded me of this one, which I received in the sum-mer of 2016. Back then, a group of us delivered speeches exposing this web of

deceit’s role in blocking action on cli-mate change. We called it the web of denial because climate denial is the web’s recipe for delay and inaction on carbon pollution. More than 20 organizations in the Koch brothers’ network, with lengthy records of climate change denial, ob-jected to being called out as Koch- linked climate change deniers. To chal-lenge our assertion that they were an orchestrated bunch of front groups, they responded with this orchestrated letter from all the front groups. They went on to say it was ‘‘tyranny’’ that we would call out who actually pays them and what interests they actually front for. I can’t wait to hear the cater-wauling from them now. Why are these polluter-funded front groups so desperate to protect Pruitt? That question sort of answers itself, doesn’t it? They do a good job of hid-ing. Unfortunately, our laws allow wealthy donors to funnel money through opaque brokers and anony-mous shell companies. The dark money could be from the ultrawealthy, right-wing Mercer family, from the Koch brothers’ empire, from ExxonMobil, from whomever—even a Russian oli-garch. We get only occasional glimpses into these dark-money channels of in-fluence in our political system, often through leaks or mistaken filings or extraordinary, painstaking research. It is not easy. For the 22 front groups that signed this recent letter, we have figured out one common denominator: the Koch brothers’ empire. Let’s go down the list. We will start with the Heartland In-stitute. We know that Heartland re-ceived at least $100,000 from founda-tions connected to the Koch brothers, and it received at least $7 million from DonorsTrust. But what is DonorsTrust? It has no business purpose. It is an identity-concealing device whose en-tire purpose is to launder donations to front groups so that you will not know their real backers. Journalists have learned, however, that the Koch broth-ers are among the largest, if not the largest, contributors to DonorsTrust. Back to our list—ALEC: Koch-con-nected foundations gave ALEC at least $600,000. Koch Industries is also a donor, but we don’t know how much it has given. More secrecy. Committee for a Constructive To-morrow: Wow, there is a good name. Who could possibly be against a con-structive tomorrow? Certainly not the Kochs, whose foundations gave it at least $45,000. That will buy a signature on a letter, for sure. American Energy Alliance: Koch-con-nected organizations gave the Amer-ican Energy Alliance at least $1.7 mil-lion. 60 Plus: Koch-backed organizations have given 60 Plus more than $42 mil-lion. This is interesting because 60 Plus is actually a front group that sup-posedly advocates for senior citizens. So its presence on this Pruitt letter is weird and telling. Idaho Freedom Foundation: It re-ceived at least $570,000 from the Koch- backed DonorsTrust. That Media Research Center I talked about received at least $1 million from DonorsTrust. Independence Institute: Koch-con-nected foundations gave the so-called Independence Institute more than $140,000 while Koch-backed DonorsTrust provided the group more than $2.5 million. Conservative Partnership Institute: This is a relatively new group, and we don’t yet know who is funding it, but we do know it is staffed by folks from other Koch-backed groups. This web of deceit shares not only common funding but common personnel. American Commitment received at least $21 million from Koch-affiliated organizations. The Center for Security Policy re-ceived at least $1.9 million from Koch- backed DonorsTrust. Like 60 Plus, this Center for Security Policy doesn’t usu-ally work on environment or energy issues. It lists its research areas as ‘‘Shariah, Defense, Homeland Security, Israel & the Middle East, Sovereignty, and National Security & New Media.’’ Its presence on the Pruitt letter is also weird and telling. The Institute for Liberty received at least $1.8 million from Koch-affiliated organizations. Americans for Limited Government received at least $5.6 million from Koch groups. Tea Party Patriots Citizens Fund: We don’t know how much money this group received directly from Koch-af-filiated organizations, but we do know that Tea Party Patriots was created by yet another front group called Freedom Works. We are getting into front groups within front groups here, folks, and Freedom Works received at least $12 million from Koch-affiliated foun-dations. Mountain States Legal Foundation received at least $90,000 from Koch- backed Donors Trust. Energy & Environment Legal Insti-tute received at least $16,000 from Koch-affiliated foundations and at least $500,000 from Koch-backed DonorsTrust. This, by the way—Energy & Environmental Legal Institute—is a particularly creepy group whose func-tion—hold your breath—is actually to harass legitimate scientists. That is what they do. Georgia Public Policy Foundation re-ceived at least $125,000 from Koch- backed DonorsTrust. Mississippi Center for Public Policy received at least $500,000 from Koch- backed DonorsTrust. Carbon Sense Coalition: We don’t know yet how much money this group received from Koch-affiliated organiza-tions, but we do know that it works in close concert with many of the other front groups in the Koch-funded web of deceit. American Family Association re-ceived at least $50,000 from Koch-affili-ated organizations. This beauty of an organization has been identified as an anti-LGBTQ hate group—hate group— by the Southern Poverty Law Center. But here it is, signing a letter boosting Trump’s EPA Administrator. Weird, again—but telling. ConservativeHQ.com: We don’t know how much money this website received from Koch-affiliated organizations, but its job is to provide favorable online coverage of the Kochs and the web of front groups. Climate Science Coalition of Amer-ica: Its parent organization received at least $45,000 from Koch-affiliated orga-nizations. If you do the math, that is actually a grand total of at least $87,281,000 re-ceived by these 22 front groups from Koch-affiliated organizations, and that is only the part that has leaked out through the screens of secrecy. Who knows how much dark money remains hidden behind those screens? Here is the point. This is a scam—so much money and so many front group tentacles. Once you see what is going on, you realize these front groups are just tentacles of the creepy billion-aires, of giant polluting corporations, and of the other special interests that fund them. The tentacles don’t rep-resent America; they represent a bunch of polluters and billionaires. The pollution angle keeps rearing its ugly head in all of this—and guess what. Koch Industries is a very big pol-luter. In 2014, Koch Industries dumped more than 6.6 million pounds of toxic pollution into our waterways. That same year, Koch Industries spent al-most $14 million in lobbying the Fed-eral Government. One of Koch Indus-tries’ biggest targets has been the EPA’s clean water rule—6.6 million pounds of toxic pollution into our wa-terways, millions in lobbying to target the clean water rule. Since the clean water rule protects our rivers and streams—sources of drinking water for millions of Americans—when Pruitt promised to repeal the clean water rule, that could mean big bucks for pol-luters like Koch Industries. Koch Industries has major holdings in the energy industry—refining gaso-line and other petroleum products, op-erating pipelines, and manufacturing petrochemicals. So when Pruitt prom-ised to repeal the Clean Power Plan and undo fuel economy standards, that could mean big bucks for Koch Indus-tries. Protecting clean water, reducing carbon emissions, and saving con-sumers money at the pump may be good for the planet and may be good for the American people, but these things are not good for polluters. So queue the web of deceit for Scott Pru-itt to write letters and bombard social media and the press with front group disinformation. If the public could see it is just a cou-ple of billionaires and oil companies and coal barons who are defending Pru-itt, the jig would be up—Americans could see the special interest motive.

Yet add on this web of phony front groups and hide-the-special-interest funding in dark money channels, and it is money well spent if Koch Industries and companies like it can go right on polluting—polluted water, polluted air, climate change unchecked—some vic-tory, but that is who they are. Americans need to get a good look at these phony front groups, so we will ex-plain who these groups are, where they get their money, and how they have in-stalled operatives throughout the Trump administration. Once upon a time, Donald Trump said he didn’t want Koch money or any-thing else from them. It turns out doz-ens of Koch apparatchiks are running the Trump administration. The Kochs probably have more control in this ad-ministration than the Trumps. They are making the Trumps their chumps. As we spotlight this web of deceit, keep in mind this one simple truth: This is not democracy. This is the cor-ruption of democracy. It is the corrup-tion of democracy to benefit narrow special interests at everyone else’s ex-pense. It is the enemy of our vision of America as a shining city on a hill. We face a choice now in this coun-try—to reclaim our destiny as that shining city on a hill that John Win-throp and Ronald Reagan spoke of or to sink into the corrupting ooze of spe-cial interest dark money, hidden influ-ence, phony front groups, and fake news. History is watching. I yield the floor.

COMMEMORATING THE 70TH ANNI-VERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF THE STATE OF ISRAEL 
HON. ADAM SMITH 
OF WASHINGTON  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 23, 2018 Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 70th anniver-sary of the founding of the state of Israel. Today, Israel is home to over 8 million peo-ple—all with unique histories that stretch from around the world. The nation has become fer-tile ground for business, innovation, and entre-preneurship, with companies leading the way in cutting edge technologies. Israel has also worked to strengthen their global outreach and assistance through the work of organizations such as MASHAV—sharing expert insight and technical assistance with countries in the de-veloping world, and helping to lift people out of poverty. Founded as a Jewish state in 1948 following the aftermath of the horrific genocide that was the Holocaust, Israel’s existence is a tribute to perseverance. From the beginning, many of Israel’s neighbors rejected their right to exist— some even taking up arms and attacking the young nation. I have been, and will continue to be, an ardent supporter of Israel, and have advocated for robust U.S. engagement to help ensure their safety and encourage peace in the region. I am proud to rise in support of Israel on this exciting anniversary, and to celebrate the deep ties that have been forged between it and the United States—including in the Ninth District of Washington state. I look forward to the future.

JUDGE PAUL W. DANAHY, JR.’S 90TH BIRTHDAY 
HON. KATHY CASTOR 
OF FLORIDA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 23, 2018 Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Judge Paul W. Danahy, Jr.’s 90th birthday, a member of my hometown of Tampa and the state of Florida’s Greatest Generation. He may wish to be remembered as much for working his way through college at the legendary Valencia Gardens restaurant as the only Anglo member of the Spanish Waiters than for being one of the longest-serv-ing members on Florida’s Second District Court of Appeals. Wherever Judge Danahy served he earned a reputation for working tire-lessly and for gaining the respect of all with whom he worked. Born in Hopkinton, Massachusetts, Judge Danahy was drawn to Tampa to play basket-ball at the University of Tampa. In Tampa he found both a new hometown and the love of his life, Georgia Reed. Judge Danahy enlisted in the army during the Korean War and has a very unique military record including three honorable discharges from two branches of the military: the Marine Reserves, the U.S, Army Infantry, and finally from service in the Army Counter Intelligence Corps, a precursor to the CIA. Upon return from military service he found his true calling and earned his law degree from the University of Florida in 1957. Judge Danahy became an influential mem-ber of the Florida House of Representatives serving from 1966 to 1974. True to form, Judge Danahy played a significant role as part of what many believe to be Tampa’s greatest state legislative delegations during the late 60s and early 70s. There, amongst other pro-gressive policies, he drafted and championed the very first enactment of our state’s Ethics Law, which continues in force to this day, and is now firmly ensconced within Florida’s Con-stitution. The Florida we know and love today would not be possible without the contributions of Judge Danahy and his partners in Florida’s Greatest Generation. After leaving the legislature Judge Danahy’s service was only beginning. He was appointed to the Second District Court of Appeals in 1977 and sat on the bench a record shattering thirty-three years, serving as Chief Judge from 1986 to 1988. In his 30th year at the court, Judge Danahy received a fitting recognition— the largest conference room at the Tampa branch of the 2nd DCA was named the Judge Paul W. Danahy, Jr., Conference Room. This recognition not only honored his record setting time on the bench but also his legislative prowess—he was largely responsible for ob-taining legislative funding to bring the branch to Tampa. Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pride to honor and send many wishes to a great Tampanian, Judge Paul W. Danahy, Jr., on his 90th birthday. His legacy continues as the patriarch of an ever-growing family to which he imparts his wisdom, and through whom his lessons and beliefs will surely echo in the years to come. f 
RECOGNIZING WOMAN OF LIGHT HONOREE INA THOMPSON 
HON. MATT GAETZ 
OF FLORIDA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 23, 2018 Mr. GAETZ. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor and pay tribute to the life and accom-plishments of Ina Thompson, who is the ninth woman to be honored in the Women of Light program sponsored by the DeFuniak Springs Woman’s Club. Women of Light honors women past and present who have made sig-nificant contributions to our community or who came from this area and made contributions elsewhere. Ina Simmons was born October 3, 1902 in Freeport, Florida. Her parents were Dr. Daniel Simmons and her mother Mary Ansley Sim-mons, an early education teacher. She had five siblings; Minnie Ruth, Sarah Gertrude, Mary Edith, Daniel Curtis and Martha Louise. Her family moved to DeFuniak Springs in 1909 where her father opened a private prac-tice in addition to caring for lumber and tur-pentine workers as a company doctor. Ina at-tended schools in Walton County and grad-uated from Walton High School in 1920. She loved sports and was on the girls’ basketball team. Her favorite subject was history. She attended Florida State College for Women and was a forward on the basketball team. She also played tennis and held an elected office each of the four years she at-tended the school. Ina graduated in 1924 with majors in history and English. She returned in 1948 and received a Masters Degree in Edu-cation at what was by then Florida State Uni-versity. After graduation Miss Simmons returned to DeFuniak Springs and taught English and his-tory at Walton High School. In 1928, Miss Simmons married Warner Thompson who had graduated from Asbury College in Wilmore, Kentucky. The couple moved to Wilmore where Warner finished his last two years at Asbury Seminary. Their son, Warner Paul Thompson Jr. was born in 1929. Rev. Warner graduated from seminary in 1930 and became a Methodist minister. The family moved to Gamber, Maryland where Rev. Thompson pastored a church. Two years later he was a minister for a church in Baltimore. Daughter Gretchen Ann was born there in 1936. Rev. Thompson suffered from asthma in an age where there were not the medicines we now have to treat it. There were times when he was too ill to give the ser-mon on a Sunday. On those days the church allowed Mrs. Thompson to fill the pulpit and deliver the sermon. In 1941, after the passing of Rev Thomp-son, the young widow and her two children re-turned to DeFuniak Springs and her family home. Mrs. Thompson worked as a visitor for the Welfare Board. In 1943 she was made a Wel-fare Board supervisor for Walton and Holmes Counties. In 1945 the Florida legislature provided funds to create in each county a new position, general supervisor of schools. This position was appointed by the county superintendent of schools. Mrs. Thompson was the first general supervisor of schools in Walton County. She was in charge of curriculum development for elementary through high schools. She held this position for ten years. In 1955, newly elected Florida governor LeRoy Collins wanted a woman to be a member of his ‘‘little cabinet’’ and be the Commissioner of the Department of Motor Vehicles. His friend, Tom Bailey, was the state superintendent of schools and Mr. Collins asked if he could recommend some-one. Mr. Bailey named Ina Thompson and she agreed to take the position. She was in charge of distributing auto license plates and col-lecting $27,000,000 in annual taxes. As president of the fourteen state South Eastern Region of Motor Vehicle Administra-tors, she would travel and host conventions to

address their mutual problems. She also trav-eled all over the United States and Canada as one of 500 delegates of the American Asso-ciation of Motor Vehicle Administrators. Mrs. Thompson was an active member of the First United Methodist Church as a Sun-day School teacher, director of youth and board member. She was a speaker for the United Methodist Women. She was involved in the community as a member of the Pilot Club, Woman’s Club and Garden Club in DeFuniak Springs. Mrs. Thompson died November 23, 1993. Her son, Paul, became a lawyer and daughter, Gretchen McCall, taught third grade and plays organ at the First United Methodist Church in DeFuniak Springs. She had five grandchildren; Ann Thompson, James McCall, Donna Powell, Beth Hrabal and Mary Grace Brooks. She had five great grandchildren; Paul Thompson, Hailee, Trevor and Christian Powell and Caro-lyn Brooks. Mrs. Thompson was honored as a Woman of Light on April 20, 2018 at the First United Methodist Church in DeFuniak Springs. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the United States Congress, I am privileged to recognize and honor Woman of Light Honoree Ina Thompson for her countless contributions and accom-plishments. She led a remarkable life and her legacy lives on through her children and the invaluable impact she had on her community.

CELEBRATING DEAN DONALD ELDRED ON HIS 90TH BIRTHDAY 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 23, 2018 Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Dean Donald Eldred who is cele-brating his 90th birthday. Dean Eldred has be-come a pillar in the Jacksonville community through his years of service to Illinois College. Donald R. Eldred earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Dubuque and a Master of Arts degree from Northwestern Uni-versity before coming to Illinois College in 1961. He retired from the College in 1993 with the emeritus titles of Dean of Students and Professor of English/Communications. Fol-lowing his retirement, he taught one or two classes at IC on a part-time basis for 12 years. Eldred’s achievements at Illinois College also include the founding of the Sturtevant Leadership awards for outstanding seniors; founding of the silver cup for outstanding lit-erary work by the men’s literary societies; en-rolling in coursework at Oxford University; being the first to design and direct a Break-Away for students throughout the British Isles, England, Scotland and Ireland; and serving in director roles for the College’s 150th and 160th anniversary celebrations. During Eldred’s affiliation with the Hilltop campus, he has worked in some capacity with eight gen-erations of students. In 2004 Illinois College conferred upon Eldred the degree of Doctor of Humane Let-ters. He was recognized as a Friend of the College by the Illinois College Alumni Associa-tion Board of Directors in 2013. Mr. Speaker, I would like to again formally celebrate Dean Donald R. Eldred on his 90th birthday. PERSONAL EXPLANATION HON. WILLIAM R. KEATING 
OF MASSACHUSETTS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 23, 2018 Mr. KEATING. Mr. Speaker, on April 18, 2018, I was attending the funeral of fallen Offi-cer Sean Gannon of the Yarmouth Police De-partment who was killed in the line of duty.

RECOGNIZING THE 125TH ANNIVER-SARY OF THE SYRACUSE BOYS AND GIRLS CLUBS 
HON. JOHN KATKO 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 23, 2018 Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 125th anniversary of the Boys and Girls Clubs of Syracuse in my district. Since 1892, the Boys and Girls Clubs of Syracuse has been serving Syracuse children of all races, religions, and socioeconomic backgrounds. While the program began as simply the ‘‘Boys’ Evening Home’’ in the May Memorial Church in Syracuse, it has grown extraordinarily in the last 125 years. Following World War I, membership contin-ued to grow exponentially, resulting in several relocations and expansions until the Club found its permanent home at 430 East Gen-esee Street. By the late 1940s, the Club had expanded to a total of three branches to ac-commodate its 6,000 members. In 1990, the Club changed its name to the Boys & Girls Club of Syracuse. After many years of wel-coming girls into the organization, it only seemed proper to finally change its name. Today, the Boys and Girls Clubs of Syra-cuse has four clubhouses and two school- based sites, which provide a variety of pro-grams for the children of Syracuse. Serving over 1,000 members annually, the Boys and Girls Clubs of Syracuse enables children in our community to realize their potential and become productive and prospering members of our society. The Boys and Girls Clubs of Syracuse will always ensure that every child has access to a safe environment after school with caring adults. The work that they do provides an in-credible benefit to Central New York, allowing parents to work hard without having to worry about the safety of their children. It is my distinct honor to recognize the Boys and Girls Clubs of Syracuse on 125 years of great success. f 
CELEBRATING THE 100TH BIRTH-DAY OF MRS. GRACE MILROY 
HON. ROD BLUM 
OF IOWA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 23, 2018 Mr. BLUM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 100th birthday of a veteran, artist, neighbor, wife, mother, and grandmother, Grace Milroy of Vinton, Iowa. Mrs. Milroy has a family of four children, ten grandchildren, and nine great-grandchildren to celebrate this special day with her. She is a family oriented woman who was married for 68 years to Boyd Milroy, and together they made a beautiful family and life. During World War II, she was stationed in Washington, D.C. working in the Office of Cor-respondence. Beginning in 1942 until the end of the war, she wrote letters to families that no family hoped to receive. The letters, unfortu-nately, were to inform the families that their loved ones in the service would not make it home. The most memorable she described was to the parents of a chaplain who was killed in action. While it was a tiring endeavor, she understood the importance of each letter and wrote as much information as the rules would allow to all recipients. After the war, she returned to Iowa where she attended college and met her husband. She was an artist in her free time, creating cross stitch projects and quilts. She even won awards for her exemplary work, and her family describes Grace as independent and hard-working. I’m proud to be able to say Happy 100th Birthday to this amazing woman, Mrs. Grace Milroy.

four, the helicopter was flying low above Savannakhet province in Laos. The helicopter took intense enemy fire and was shot down. No rescue mission was conducted because of the heavy concentration of enemy troops. Mr. Cleve’s remains have never been recovered. His family was left to wonder whether he might have survived and been taken prisoner. But Mr. Cleve never returned home. He and his crew remain numbered among the nearly 600 Americans who disappeared in Laos. Today, 47 years later, his sacrifice is hon-ored at Jefferson Barracks National Cemetery. At another ceremony in his hometown on March 24, 2018, his name will be etched on a memorial at the St. Francois County Court-house. It is with great appreciation and respect to honor the service and sacrifice of Warrant Of-ficer First Class Reginald David Cleve today before the United States House of Represent-atives.

CELEBRATING THE 70TH ANNIVER-SARY OF THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE MODERN JEWISH STATE OF ISRAEL 
HON. LOU BARLETTA 
OF PENNSYLVANIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 23, 2018 Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, it is a great honor for me to help commemorate the 70th anniversary of the establishment of the mod-ern Jewish State of Israel. As I reflect on Israel’s 70 years of inde-pendent and democratic governance, I am re-minded of the strength and resilience of the Israeli people. Israel’s statehood was hard- fought and long overdue. Israel’s story has long been admired by the United States, with generations of Americans having advocated on behalf of the Jewish peo-ple’s aspiration to return to their beloved homeland, including Presidents like George Washington, John Adams, and Abraham Lin-coln. President Truman forged a valuable and ev-erlasting relationship between our two nations when he made the United States the first country to officially recognize Israel as an independent state. Since then, the United States has been proud to stand with Israel and her people not just as allies, but also as friends. Since its rebirth in 1948, Israel has proven itself to be a beacon of democracy and eco-nomic progress in the Middle East. Despite fierce opposition and unjust violence, Israel continues to succeed as a global power where the Jewish people have a formidable seat on the world stage. To express the unbreakable bond between the modem State of Israel and its ancient na-tionalism rooted in biblical times, the 70th an-niversary official logo combines the number 70, a modern design of the Star of David, and the word Israel as written by a scribe in a Torah scroll. Together, these images bridge the extensive history of Israel, from the days of King David’s reign to the nation’s modern sovereignty. I am honored to congratulate Israel on reaching this milestone, and consider it a privi-lege to work toward our nations’ common in-terests in the United States House of Rep-resentatives. Mr. Speaker, please join me in commemo-rating the 70th anniversary of the establish-ment of the modern Jewish State of Israel. f 
CELEBRATING THE TOWN OF COR-INTH’S BICENTENNIAL ANNIVER-SARY 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 23, 2018 Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and recognize the Town of Corinth as it celebrates its 200th Anniversary. The Town of Corinth was formally created in 1818 from the Town of Hadley, but was origi-nally called Jessup’s Landing after brothers Edward and Ebenezer Jessup arrived from England. To establish the area as a town, the town fathers gave Mrs. Washington Chapman the honor of officially naming the town. She opened the Bible by chance to the First Corin-thians, and proclaimed the town to be called Corinth. Since then, the people of Corinth have worked hard to develop a prosperous community loved by all who live there. Located on the banks of the Hudson River in the foothills of the Adirondack Mountains, the surrounding lakes, streams, and wood-lands of the quaint town provide beauty at every turn. For the past 200 years, the resi-dents of Corinth have enjoyed life in this beau-tiful area of the North Country as they con-tinue to develop and modernize their commu-nity. On behalf of New York’s 21st District, I want to congratulate Corinth, New York, on its 200th Anniversary, and wish its residents all the best as they celebrate this momentous oc-casion.

HONORING CAROLYN C. JUDD AND CLEMENTINE M. ZAKER ON THEIR 80TH BIRTHDAYS 
HON. DANIEL LIPINSKI 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 23, 2018 Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Carolyn C. Judd and Clementine M. Zaker, twin sisters who will be celebrating their 80th birthdays on May 2nd. Carolyn and Clementine were born on May 2, 1938, to Theodore and Clementine Price in Chicago, Illinois, where they lived until moving a short distance to Burbank. From a young age, the sisters were an inseparable pair and their bond remains strong. Carolyn and Clem-entine have four and three children, respec-tively, and watching their grandchildren grow up has brought the sisters plenty of joy. To this day, the sisters live less than 15 minutes away from each other, with Carolyn in Hickory Hills and Clementine in Burbank. Chicagoland has always been home to Carolyn and Clementine, and they have been active in their communities throughout their lives. Carolyn spent her career with Nabisco before retiring from her position as a secretary to the general manager at the Chicago plant. She remains involved in the community through her work as the Secretary ofthe Jus-tice Chamber of Commerce. Clementine is a dedicated wife and mother, having raised her three children with her husband, Ronald Zaker. She is very committed to her Catholic faith and helped bring the Eucharist to those in the community who were unable to attend Mass. Until recently, the sisters greatly en-joyed going to local craft shows where they would sell items including ornaments, jewelry, and embroidered pillows. They continue to enjoy each other’s company in sharing meals and taking vacations together. I ask my colleagues to join me in recog-nizing Carolyn and Clementine on this special occasion. It is not often that twin sisters are able to celebrate their 80th birthday together, and I am inspired learning about these re-markable women and their lifelong companion-ship. May Carolyn and Clementine live long and healthy lives with family and loved ones, while continuing to contribute to their commu-nities. f 
HONORING ST. PETER SCHOOL 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 23, 2018 Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask the House of Representatives to join me in recognizing the 150th anniversary of St. Peter School, a National Blue Ribbon School of Excellence on Capitol Hill. St. Peter School was founded in 1868 with the Sisters of the Holy Cross for the purposes of taking a holistic approach in order to edu-cate the whole child. Specifically, its mission states, ‘‘St. Peter School is a family of learn-ers serving the Capitol Hill parishes and com-munity. The children are provided with an edu-cation that is founded on love of God and service to others, characterized by Catholic values and academic excellence, and dedi-cated to addressing each child’s unique tal-ents and abilities.’’ In addition to its mission statement, St. Peter School is committed to cultivating a dedicated team of faculty and staff in one of the oldest continuously operating Catholic ele-mentary schools in Washington, D.C. St. Peter School seeks to be a place in which faith be-comes living, conscious and active through in-struction and participation in prayer, worship, sacraments and service. The school is committed to fostering an en-vironment that ensures that students of all faiths, races and creeds are challenged through a rigorous academic program and are taught to be considerate, contributing mem-bers of a global society. It is also important to note that St. Peter School partners not only engage in charitable works with local organi-zations to serve those in need in Washington, D.C., but it also engages with a sister school in Haiti so that students understand what it means to be a force of good throughout the world. I live on Capitol Hill, where St. Peter’s is lo-cated, and know families who speak fondly of the school. Therefore, I ask the House of Representa-tives to join me in recognizing the 150th anni-versary of St. Peter School.

IN HONOR OF THE 100TH BIRTH-DAY CELEBRATION OF ALFONSON L. CAMPBELL 
HON. ANDRE´CARSON 
OF INDIANA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 23, 2018 Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize Alfonson L. Campbell. Mr. C, as his family and friends affection-ately call him, is celebrating his 100th birth-day. He was born on the Theo Baker Dairy Farm in Culpepper, Virginia on April 20, 1918. His father, who was white, and his mother who was black, raised 5 children in a two- room farmhouse. At a very young age, Mr. Campbell helped his father on the farm by shoveling hay, milk-ing cows and feeding chickens. He also spent his childhood gathering wood for the stove, storing milk in the well to keep cool, stuffing bedding with hay to use as mattresses, and breaking ice that formed on a nearby lake to store meat and hunted opossum. Mr. Camp-bell walked over a mile to attend a one-room school, where the teacher was also his preacher. His father took care of the farm to pay his debts to the property owner and left the farm after the debt was paid. A few years later, Mr. Campbell also left the farm at 16 years old to begin a new life in Washington, DC. Mr. Campbell joined the Army and served seven years in the Army National Guard. Dur-ing his time of service, he participated in the Korean War Conflict. After leaving the military, he followed his childhood dream of becoming an automobile mechanic. He was the favorite amongst his co-workers, always teaching them the ‘tricks of the trade.’ His intelligence, me-chanical skills and his ethics were so impres-sive that his boss rewarded him with $100.00 when the business closed. His love for cars secured him an auto-mechanic job with the District of Columbia Government for 45 years. Upon retiring from the DC government, Mr. Campbell went on to operate a successful lawn service business for 16 years. Mr. Campbell credits his longevity to his faith in Jesus Christ and love of life. He enjoys fishing, tinkering with cars, eating the three C’s (cabbage, collard greens and cornbread), and enjoyed travels with his late wife to var-ious destinations such as Africa, Acapulco, Aruba, Germany and Hawaii. His greatest loves now are his son, daughter, six grand-children, 10 great-grandchildren, and Jesus Christ. Mr. Alfonson L. Campbell turned 100 years old on April 20, 2018. I ask my colleagues to join me in extending our warmest birthday greetings to him and wishing him many more healthy and happy years. f 
HONORING GERI SHAPIRO 
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 23, 2018 Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, it is my great honor to recognize a dear friend, a dedicated public servant, a tireless advocate, and one of the nicest people I have ever had the pleasure of knowing, Ms. Geri Shapiro. Geri is receiving the ‘‘Legacy Award’’ at this year’s ‘‘Volunteers Spirit Awards’’ in Westchester, hosted by Vol-unteer New York. I cannot think of a more de-serving or impressive honoree. A Senior Advisor to Senator K
IRSTEN GILLI-
BRAND , Geri is a longtime Westchester resi-dent who is intimately involved with a wide- array of important issues that impact our com-munity and its residents. She is a staunch ad-vocate for the county, working with leadership from all levels of government, nonprofits and the business community. Geri understands finer details of the ‘‘big picture’’ of any issue— seniors, people with disabilities, access to so-cial services, nuclear power, healthcare—but her primary focus is always on the person or family whose life is directly impacted. The story of how Geri got into public service is an inspiring one. Her first career was as a stay-at-home mom who devoted much of her time volunteering at her daughter’s school and caring for her aging parents. She was active in the Edgemont PTA and served as PTA president. In 2000, she began volunteering for Hillary Clinton’s U.S. Senate campaign. Known by her family as the ‘‘expeditor,’’ her skills and experiences were quickly recognized and, at age 59, she was asked to serve as Westchester County Regional Director for Senator Clinton. In 2009 she transitioned to Regional Director for Senator K
IRSTEN GILLI-
BRAND , and currently serves as a Senior Advi-sor. Though Geri is not always in the spotlight, you can be certain she is always working to make Westchester County a better place, all while inspiring and empowering others. Throughout her career, she has mentored staff, volunteers, and members of the commu-nity, particularly women. Geri has been hon-ored with the National Association for Female Executives 2012 Women of Excellence Award for Service to New York for her ‘‘vision, cour-age, compassion, proven success and gen-erosity as demonstrated by how they help other women succeed.’’ Volunteering, and a bit of tenacity, opened a new door in Geri’s life. I’m certainly glad it did. Geri has done some amazing work on be-half of Westchester County and its residents, and we are all grateful for her advocacy. As Volunteer New York honors her with their Leg-acy Award, I too would like to send my appre-ciation to Geri, and my personal thanks. She has been a great partner to me in the commu-nity for many years, but more importantly, she has been a wonderful friend. Congratulations to Geri on this great honor. f

TRIBUTE TO VELVALEA ‘‘VEL’’ HORTENSE RODGERS PHILLIPS 
HON. GWEN MOORE 
OF WISCONSIN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 23, 2018 Ms. MOORE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Vel Phillips a public servant, judge, civil rights activist, mentor, states-woman and trailblazer. Vel Phillips was born and raised in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and like me was a graduate of North Division High School. She graduated from Howard Univer-sity and graduated from the University of Wis-consin—Madison Law School. Vel Phillips passed away on April 17, 2018 at the age of 95 years. Vel Phillips’ life has been a series of firsts: the first African American woman to graduate from the University of Wisconsin—Madison Law School; the first woman and African American to win a seat on the City of Milwau-kee’s Common Council; the first woman and African American to win statewide election by becoming Secretary of State of Wisconsin; the first woman and African American to become a judge in Milwaukee County. She was the first African American in the country elected to the National Committee of a major political party, and knew three presidents on a first- name basis: John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, and Jimmy Carter. Vel realized all of these accomplishments at a time when many African Americans were not allowed to exer-cise their civil rights. Vel ran for elected office to improve the lives of people and in 1956, she won a seat on the City of Milwaukee’s Common Council. The heart of Vel’s district was known as the Inner Core which consisted of poor housing stock, ill equipped schools, and few jobs. This was further exacerbated by several other facts: city leaders who refused to provide funds to repair roads and schools in the Inner Core; white landlords who would not rent to black people outside of the Inner Core; and Black families who were denied access to buy homes in other parts of the city. Vel knew something had to be done and introduced a Fair Housing Law in 1962 that would make it illegal not to rent to black people. It was not fair to tell people where they could and could not live, work and go to school because of the color of their skin and Vel began marching with Catholic priest, Father James Groppi to bring change. They led people, including me, on 200 consecutive nights of marching from the Inner Core across the 16th Street Viaduct to a destination on the Southside of Mil-waukee. Angry white men and women lined the streets and swore and threw rocks and bottles at the marchers. Finally, in 1968, the Fair Housing Law that Vel had written six years earlier passed the city council. In addition to the positions previously men-tioned, Vel taught at the University of Wis-consin Milwaukee and was appointed ‘‘Distin-guished Professor of Law’’ at Marquette Uni-versity School of Law. In 2006, Phillips found-ed the Vel Phillips Foundation which supports the work of people who are engaged in projects of social justice and change including opposing voter ID and other attacks on voting rights. Vel was the beloved wife for 38 years of the late W. Dale Phillips and the loving mother of Michael Damon Phillips and of the late Dale Franklin Phillips. She was the proud grand-mother of Elijah Thomas Phillips, Nathaniel Douglas Phillips, Rachael Velvalea Phillips and Robin Dale Phillips; great-grandmother of Tianna, Mya, and Phoenix and dear aunt of Shaune Maria Curry. She leaves a strong leg-acy of leadership for all people to model. Mr. Speaker, Vel was my friend, champion and mentor. She cheered me on through every victory in my life and taught me to al-ways keep the faith. In fact, she chaired my successful congressional campaign in 2004 at eighty years young. I draw strength from her unshakable spirit and she will live on forever in my heart. Vel is a Milwaukee and Wisconsin treasure and I not only valued her service to the 4th Congressional District but to the entire nation. I urge my colleagues in the U.S. House of Representatives to join me in a sa-lute to the late Velvalea ‘‘Vel’’ Hortense Rod-gers Phillips, may she Rest in Power.
