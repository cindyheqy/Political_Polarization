Senate 
NOMINATION OF FRANK ROSE AND 
OFFICIAL CORRESPONDENCE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE ON PROPOSED EUROPEAN UNION CODE OF CONDUCT FOR OUTER SPACE ACTIVITIES 
∑Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I am 
deeply concerned by proposals for arms control plans related to missile defense and outer space arms, including the EU Code of Conduct for Outer Space activi-ties, which the Obama administration has embraced. These plans were con-firmed by Rose Gottemoeller, Under-secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security, during a House subcommittee hearing last week. I firmly believe any inter-national agreement on a code of con-duct for space should be submitted for Senate advice and consent as part of its treaty powers, and not be an ‘‘exec-utive agreement’’ that sidesteps that 
process. 
I have engaged with the State De-
partment to ensure that this agree-ment will not be a unilateral act and that it will be fully presented to Con-gress before moving forward. I strongly believe, given the importance of this issue, that the U.S. Senate should be consulted as part of their advice and consent role in any decision to move forward. 
I ask to have printed in the R
ECORD  
at the end of my remarks official let-ters and correspondence with the nomi-nee, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State, Frank Rose that demonstrate three important points. First, due to serious ongoing concerns related to na-tional security, the administration has not pursued plans to propose the nego-tiation of a debris-generating ASAT testing moratorium at this time; sec-ond, that any decision to subscribe to a code in the future will not in any way constrain our national security-related activities in space or ability to protect the U.S. or allies; third, and most im-portantly, that the Senate will be given access to the details surrounding any plan once and if any format is de-
termined, and again before any agree-ment is entered. 
Space is vital to our national secu-
rity, and we must maintain the ability to use satellites and various missile ca-pabilities. In particular, space is of critical importance to our national in-telligence and warfighting capabilities. The development of anti-satellite capa-bilities by countries such as China and Russia is well documented, as in the example of China successfully testing a direct-ascent, anti-satellite SC–19 mis-sile against one of its own satellites. 
It is vital that the United States en-
sure we are not restricting activity in ways that put our security at risk. Members of Congress have been clear in their view that they see ample dis-advantage to such a code for the United States; according to assess-ments by the uniformed military, im-plementation of this code would result in real world operational impacts. Con-gress has previously voted to limit international agreements concerning outer space activities. Section 913 of the fiscal year 2013 National Defense Authorization Act, H.R. 4310, states that any agreement will have no le-gally binding effect or basis for lim-iting the activities of the United States in outer space, and it requires certification that any such agreement will be equitable, enhance national se-curity, and have no militarily signifi-cant impact on the ability of the United States to conduct military or intelligence activities in space. 
There are several key areas that the 
administration must resolve before moving forward on pursuing any deci-sion. Pentagon officials have long ex-pressed concern that the arms initia-tive will be exploited by states such as China and Russia to constrain U.S. missile defenses, while both states con-tinue to develop their own advanced missile defenses. In 2007, the Depart-ment of Defense concluded that the progress in addressing the vulner-ability of U.S. space assets has not 
kept pace with growing threat capabili-ties; consequently, the vulnerability of our space assets continues to grow. Ad-ditionally, a previous U.S. Commission to Assess United States National Secu-rity Space Management and Organiza-tion released a report that predicted that future warfare in space was a ‘‘vir-tual certainty’’ and urged the United States to begin to develop the means both to deter and defend against at-tacks on its space assets, and to mount offensive operations to deny the use of space to potential adversaries. To do otherwise, the commission warned, would invite a ‘‘space Pearl Harbor.’’ 
Further troubling, a 2014 Department 
of Defense report noted that China is ‘‘developing a multi-dimensional pro-gram to improve its capabilities to limit or prevent the use of space-based assets by adversaries during times of crisis or conflict,’’ including ‘‘destroy-ing or capturing satellites and other sensors.’’ To protect against these types of attacks, the Department of Defense’s ongoing policy is aimed at retaining the capabilities to respond at 
the time and place of our choosing. Any effort to move forward must ad-dress our national security needs and Congressional concerns. 
Therefore, any State Department ef-
fort to move forward with a code or a debris-generating ASAT testing mora-torium should fully overcome existing concerns and ensure the plan does not undermine current Department of De-fense policy, U.S. capabilities, or con-gressional concerns. Our growing de-pendence on space makes it funda-mental to U.S. national security inter-ests. I remain extremely concerned by what appears to be previous endeavors by the administration to avoid address-ing space policy concerns and potential administration efforts to bypass Con-gress. 
While I am pleased at the assurances 
that Mr. Rose has provided and that relevant offices will engage with Con-gress if a path forward is agreed upon,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6936 January 2, 2015 
I remain extremely concerned about 
the decision to negotiate a measure using past measures such as the Euro-pean Union’s Code of Conduct as a starting point. Russia has dem-onstrated its willingness to break its agreements, as seen with the ongoing violation of the 1987 Intermediate- range Nuclear Forces Treaty. We need to improve our capacity to understand what is going on in space, and we need to ensure we are adequately capable of deterring the growing number of coun-tries that are pursuing weapons capa-ble of targeting U.S. satellites. 
While necessary, the development of 
transparency and confidence-building measures and behavioral norms pro-moting responsible space operations should not come at the expense of America’s national security. The Presi-dent’s own Space Policy released in 2010 states: ‘‘The United States will employ a variety of measures to help assure the use of space for all respon-sible parties, and, consistent with the inherent right of self-defense, deter others from interference and attack, defend our space systems and con-tribute to the defense of allied space systems, and, if deterrence fails, defeat efforts to attack them.’’ With a grow-ing number of states acquiring the ability to degrade or destroy U.S. space capabilities, the probability that space systems will come under attack in a fu-ture crisis or conflict is ever increas-ing. The State Department cannot have the attitude that they are going to go it alone. The United States can-not afford it. 
The material is as follows: 
CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES , 
Washington, DC, November 12, 2014. 
Mr. F RANK ROSE, 
Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Space 
and Defense Policy, 
U.S. Department of State, Washington, DC. 
DEAR DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF  
STATE ROSE: We write to ask for your clari-
fication regarding the Administration’s space arms control posture. Like you, we are deeply concerned by the rising threats of anti-satellite weapons in the hands of states like the People’s Republic of China. That said, we believe the Administration would do better to focus on real solutions to these threats, as opposed to more feel good meas-ures like the European Union’s (EU) Code of Conduct for Outer Space activities or other similar measures. 
We are concerned by proposals for outer 
space arms control, including the EU Code of Conduct for Outer Space activities, which the Administration has embraced. We see no advantage to such a Code for the United States; according to assessments by the uni-formed military, implementation of this code would result in real world operational impacts. The product of this equation de-mands the opposition of the entire United States government. 
With the languishing of that Code, we fear 
a new threat to our ability to protect U.S. outer space capabilities, and, perhaps even to develop our missile defenses. We seek your understanding of the Administration’s posi-tion on space arms control, specifically, the ‘‘debris generating kinetic energy ASAT testing moratorium’’ which, as we have been informed, you proposed to U.S. allies. We are unfamiliar with any such proposal having been coordinated with the Department of De-
fense or the uniformed military, and there-fore we ask for your answers to the following questions: 
1) Please indicate the date, and by which 
Department official, the State Department Circular 175 request was signed. What was the scope of this Circ–175 and has the Depart-ment determined if this moratorium would be submitted to the Senate for its advice and consent? 
2) If this Circ–175 will not be submitted to 
the Senate, on what basis would such an international agreement be negotiated and to what end? 
3) Please detail the potential implications 
for United States space and missile defense activities. How would such an agreement protect our ability to fully develop our mis-sile defenses, including our test and targets program? 
4) Please further detail how such agree-
ment will ensure full freedom of action for the United States to take needed defensive and other action in space. 
5) Please provide the Joint Staff assess-
ment of impacts to military operations you obtained before discussing this moratorium with our allies. 
6) Please detail the specific allies with 
which you have discussed this moratorium and the respective dates of discussion. Please further detail which State Department offi-cial authorized these discussions. 
We appreciate your prompt responses to 
these questions. 
Sincerely, 
D

United States Senator.

Member of Congress. 
U.S. D EPARTMENT OF STATE , 
Washington, DC, November 17, 2014. 
DEARSENATOR VITTER : Thank you for your 
letter of November 12 regarding the Adminis-tration’s efforts to enhance the security and sustainability of the outer space environ-ment. 
The Administration is deeply concerned 
about the development of anti-satellite (ASAT) capabilities by countries like China and Russia. In response to this increasing threat, the Department of State is pursuing a comprehensive approach to space security, including the development of bilateral and multilateral transparency and confidence building measures (TCBMs) such as the International Code of Conduct, development of international long-term sustainability guidelines by the UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, and other measures. The Administration believes that pragmatic TCBMs like the Code are a much more effective way to ensure the long-term security of the space environment as com-pared to fundamentally flawed space arms control proposals like the Russian-Chinese sponsored Prevention of Placement of Weap-ons in Outer Space Treaty. 
The United States has made clear to our 
partners that we will not enter into a code of conduct, or other agreement, that in any way constrains our national security-related activities in space or our ability to protect 
the United States and our allies. We have worked closely with our colleagues in the Defense Department and Intelligence Com-munity to ensure that the Code does not have any adverse impact on U.S. operations, including the development and testing of missile defenses. The Department, in coordi-nation with the interagency, provided a se-ries of briefings to Congress on the Adminis-tration’s decision-making process regarding our willingness to work with our European allies to help craft a Code that would benefit U.S. national security. We are available to provide updates at any time. The Administration has been clear that we 
are open to space arms control proposals. However, any such proposal would need to meet the criteria as outlined in the Presi-dent’s 2010 National Space Policy (NSP)— that it be effectively verifiable, equitable, and in the interests of the United States and its allies. At this time, the Administration has made no decision to propose the negotia-tion of a debris-generating ASAT testing moratorium, and therefore, no C–175 request has been signed. If a decision were made to move forward with a proposal in the future, we would work closely with the Department of Defense and Intelligence Community to ensure there were no adverse operational im-pacts from our efforts, especially on our mis-sile defense and space systems. Furthermore, while we discuss a wide variety of space se-curity issues with allies—including the po-tential for a Code of Conduct and ways to ad-dress the development of ASAT systems—we have not made a specific proposal to allies for negotiation of a debris-generating ASAT testing moratorium. 
The Department is fully committed to 
closely coordinating all diplomatic space se-curity proposals within the U.S. interagency. We would not table a proposal that had not received full U.S. Government approval and took into account all agencies’ perspectives. 
Should you wish to have further discus-
sions on this issue, the Administration would be happy to assemble an interagency team to meet with you to provide further background on our efforts, and answer any additional questions you may have. 
We hope this information is useful. Please 
do not hesitate to contact us if we can be of further assistance. 
Sincerely, 
J
ULIA FRIFIELD , 
Assistant Secretary, Legislative Affairs. 
U.S. D EPARTMENT OF STATE , 
Washington, DC, December 10, 2014. 
DEARSENATOR VITTER , In response to fol-
low-up questions from your staff, we would like to provide the following clarifications about our efforts to promote the security and long-term sustainability of the outer space environment. 
As I noted in my letter of November 12, 
2014, the Administration is seriously con-cerned about the development of anti-sat-ellite capabilities by countries like China. We believe that effective diplomatic efforts are a critical tool in the United States’ com-prehensive response to countering this threat. At the same time, we recognize your concerns and want to assure you that we share them. We have made every effort to en-sure that our diplomatic efforts to promote the security and sustainability of outer space do not have an adverse impact on our national security activities, especially on our missile defense and space systems. 
The administration has no plans to propose 
the negotiation of a debris-generating ASAT testing moratorium at this time. Moreover, there has been no consideration as to what format we would seek for any proposed de-bris-generating ASAT testing moratorium. As a result, no C–175 package has been pre-pared. 
Currently, our diplomatic focus is on the 
development of an International Code of Conduct on Outer Space Activities. At this time, the European Union is considering its next steps on the Code. As we stated in 2012, the United States has decided to work with the European Union and other nations to help develop a code which can help maintain the long-term sustainability, safety, sta-bility and security of outer space by estab-lishing guidelines for the responsible use of outer space. Since the text of the Code has not been finalized, the Administration has

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6937 January 2, 2015 
made no decision on whether to subscribe to 
the code. Only after the text is finalized and open for subscription will the Administra-tion consider whether to subscribe to the Code. Such a decision will be made only after it received full U.S. Government approval that takes into account perspectives from all departments and agencies. 
As former Secretary of State Hillary Clin-
ton stated in January 2012, the United States will not sign-up to a Code of Conduct that any way constrains our national security-re-lated activities in space or our ability to pro-tect the United States or our allies. If the United States were to make a decision to subscribe to a Code in the future, it would be implemented in a way that is fully con-sistent with this statement. 
Let me also assure you that we are in close 
contact with our Department of Defense and Intelligence Community colleagues on the development of the Code to ensure the Code does not have any adverse impacts on U.S. operations, including the development and testing of missile defenses. 
Should you wish to have further discus-
sions on this issue, we would be prepared to assemble an interagency team to meet with you or your staff. Please do not hesitate to contact us if we can be of further assistance. 
Sincerely,

U.S. D EPARTMENT OF STATE , 
Washington, DC, December 11, 2014. 
DEARSENATOR VITTER : I wanted to follow- 
up with regarding the conversation I had with your staff regarding a potential debris generating anti-satellite (ASAT) testing moratorium and the European Union’s pro-posed International Code of Conduct for Outer Space Activities. 
As Assistant Secretary of State Julia 
Frifield noted in her December 10, 2014, letter to you, the Administration has no plans to propose the negotiation of a debris-gener-ating ASAT testing moratorium at this time. Should we determine to pursue such an agreement in the future, I pledge to keep you and your staff informed, including on the form of which a potential agreement might take. 
With regard to the Code of Conduct, it is 
my understanding that there are no imple-mentation issues for the Department of De-fense related to the current draft of the Code. That said, only after the text of the Code is finalized will we have a full under-standing of any potential implementation issues. Therefore, we continue to be in close contact with our colleagues at the Depart-ment of Defense and the Intelligence Com-munity to ensure that our efforts to promote the security and sustainability of outer space do not have an adverse impact on our national security activities, especially on our missile defense and national security space systems. 
Before a final decision is made to subscribe 
to the Code, the Department, along with our interagency colleagues, will make sure to provide a briefing, including relevant mate-rials such as the text of the Code and other materials, to you and the relevant commit-tees on the terms of the agreement, its im-plementation, and any other issues of inter-est. 
I appreciate your interest in these issues. 
Please do not hesitate to reach out to me or my staff in the future with any questions you may have.

Space and Defense Policy. ∑ TRIBUTES TO DEPARTING 
SENATORS 
TIM JOHNSON  
∑Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I 
also wish to pay tribute to a man I have admired throughout my career in this Chamber, Senator T
IMJOHNSON of 
South Dakota. I am proud to call T IM 
my friend. 
Long before Senator J OHNSON and I 
crossed paths in the Senate, we were both studying at Michigan State Uni-versity—I was an undergrad while Sen-ator J
OHNSON was doing postgraduate 
studies. In fact, his parents retired in the East Lansing area. I know that Senator J
OHNSON considers the Univer-
sity of South Dakota to be his alma mater, but I will always think of him as a fellow Spartan. 
All of us here are committed to pub-
lic service, to defending the Constitu-tion and to protecting our Nation against foreign threats, but few of us have had our commitment tested as Senator J
OHNSON has. 
In 2004 Senator J OHNSON learned that 
he had prostate cancer, but he was de-termined to beat it and to continue representing the people of South Da-kota. ‘‘I wish this was something that wasn’t happening to me,’’ he said. ‘‘But I will deal with it head on,’’ and he did. He had surgery, then he made a full re-covery, and was soon back to work. 
In 2006 we were all shocked to learn 
that Senator J
OHNSON suffered a brain 
hemorrhage—and for weeks we hoped and prayed for him and his family. In-credibly, he again made a full recov-ery—and he again came back to work. 
That is commitment. That is a Sen-
ator with a deep appreciation for the privilege of serving the people of South Dakota. That is T
IMJOHNSON  
Despite the personal health issues 
Senator J OHNSON experienced, he suc-
ceeded in leading passage of the Safe and Fair Deposit Insurance Act of 2005, a law that 3 years later was critical to keeping America’s deposits safe during a time of great economic turmoil. As chair of the Senate banking committee we have relied on his leadership and judgment in reducing risk in the finan-cial sector and in ensuring that Dodd- Frank reforms were implemented effec-tively. 
I will miss our work together to im-
prove the health care of American vet-erans, and I will miss the opportunity I have had through the years to work with Senator J
OHNSON on empowering 
small family farms to compete in the modern marketplace and to help eth-anol producers expand their place in our Nation’s renewable energy future. 
Knowing how important it was for 
ranchers to be able to tell consumers their meat products came from the U.S.A., Senator J
OHNSON has been a 
champion of country of origin labeling since going back to the 2002 farm bill, and since then he has helped to strengthen and fully implement the law, a mission that carried over to the 2014 farm bill that I authored as chair of the agriculture committee. In addition, Senator J
OHNSON has 
been a forceful advocate for the Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration rules that ensure that family farmers and ranchers are able to compete on a level playing field. 
I know how much Senator J
OHNSON  
has loved policymaking, so I know he must have agonized over this decision. But I also know that the love and devo-tion he has for his family comes first, and now he will be able to spend more time with his wife Barbara, his two sons, his daughter, and all his grand-children. 
T
IM, thank you for being such a 
strong, resilient, and resourceful part-ner and friend through the years. I wish you a happy and successful retire-ment with your family. 
MARY LANDRIEU  
Mr. President, at the end of this ses-
sion of Congress, the Senate will be bidding farewell to my colleague and dear friend, Senator M
ARY LANDRIEU , 
who has served the people of Louisiana with such devotion over the last 18 years. 
I don’t think it is possible to over-
state the magnitude of the challenges that she has faced on behalf of her con-stituents. Hurricane Katrina may have been the most horrible natural disaster our country has ever experienced—and Senator L
ANDRIEU ’s native city of New 
Orleans was ground zero. 
No one was more engaged in the re-
covery effort that followed that calam-ity. Senator L
ANDRIEU fought tena-
ciously to secure the funds it would take to repair and revitalize the gulf coast with infrastructure improve-ments that would protect the coast against another major event. 
In the 10 years since Katrina, Sen-
ator L
ANDRIEU has been a champion for 
homeowners who were struggling to af-ford flood insurance, most recently by winning passage of the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act, this past March. 
Of course, just as the gulf coast ap-
peared close to making a full recovery, it was struck by another disaster—the Deepwater Horizon oilspill. Again, Sen-ator L
ANDRIEU was on the vanguard of 
that recovery, winning passage of the RESTORE Act so that the vast major-ity of the fines collected by the U.S. Government would go back to the gulf coast to help pay for the cleanup. It is the single biggest investment in envi-ronmental restoration in American his-tory. 
These were the moments when the 
people of Louisiana needed M
ARYLAN-
DRIEU most—and she delivered as only 
she can. 
At the same time, Senator L ANDRIEU  
has always understood that the oil and gas industry is vital to her State’s economy, and so it was a major mile-stone when she became the first woman to chair the Senate energy committee. 
She fights so hard for Louisiana, but 
over the years of working with her, I have learned how much she is driven by a deep feeling of compassion, not just

for those displaced by hurricanes or 
those whose livelihood was jeopardized by the Deepwater Horizon but for the children of her State and our country who were given up for adoption or placed in foster care. 
Senator L
ANDRIEU knows the joys of 
adopting firsthand, having adopted her two children, Connor and Mary Shan-non, and she wants other parents to feel that joy. So she sympathizes with parents who wish to adopt a child but who are struggling to do so—especially since she knows there are children des-perate for parents but who remain wards of the State. By matching those parents with that child, she knows that she can create a true family. 
So she has led the efforts in the Sen-
ate to improve child welfare systems internationally and to make it easier for American parents to adopt children in other countries. She has pushed for Federal funds to create foster care mentoring programs, so that children who are in the foster system have bet-ter guidance during the most critical years of their social development. 
I know I speak for other Members of 
this Chamber when I say that we will do our very best to continue the mo-mentum that Senator L
ANDRIEU has 
created for finding a permanent, loving home for every American child. 
I will deeply miss having her with us 
but I have absolutely no doubt that M
ARY LANDRIEU will find new ways to 
express her devotion to the people of Louisiana and our country. It is not just a tradition in her family; it is her singular passion. I thank her for her amazing service here and I look for-ward to all the great achievements that are in her future. 
MARK UDALL  
Mr. President, I wish to express my 
gratitude to a dear colleague and friend who has been a champion for our na-tional parks and for preserving the nat-ural splendor of our Western lands: Senator M
ARKUDALL . 
Just as the Great Lakes are part of 
my DNA, the Rocky Mountains are part of Senator U
DALL ’s. He likes to 
quote the saying that we did not in-herit this earth from our parents but that we are borrowing it from our chil-dren—and that is the perspective that has guided him as Chair of the Senate National Parks Subcommittee. 
He has worked to expand national 
parks and to revitalize our natural re-sources. Recognizing that our depend-ence on fossil fuels poses a threat to our land, water and wildlife, Senator U
DALL has been a leader in pushing for 
investments in renewable energy. I know how proud he was that Colorado was the first State to pass a voter-ap-proved renewable energy policy. A key to making it happen was Senator U
DALL teaming up in a bipartisan way 
with the speaker of the Colorado House. 
When Colorado was struck by floods, 
forest fires, and beetle infestations, Senator U
DALL fought to make sure 
the State had the Federal resources to contain the damage and aid the recov-
ery. 
We learn a lot about our leaders dur-
ing a time of crisis, and time and again, Senator U
DALL has proven the 
strength of his character and his con-victions. 
In the wake of the mass shooting in 
Aurora, CO, Senator U
DALL threw his 
support behind a ban on combat weap-ons, as well as an amendment to ex-pand background searches for gun pur-chases. It was a bold position to take politically, but the Udall family has a long tradition of taking bold positions whose wisdom is borne out by history: His grandfather issued a court decision that recognized Native Americans’ right to vote; his uncle challenged dis-crimination by Washington’s football team; and his father helped integrate the University of Arizona. 
It is fitting that in Senator U
DALL ’s 
last full week with the Senate he gave a stirring speech on the floor, demand-ing transparency in the way that our Nation treats suspected terrorists. Sen-ator U
DALL has also been one of the 
Senate’s most vocal advocates for civil liberties, arguing passionately that our government’s conduct must always re-spect both our values and the Constitu-tion. 
Personally, I have had the honor of 
working alongside Senator U
DALL as 
co-Chair of the Congressional Caucus on Parkinson’s Disease, teaming up on behalf of the National MS and Parkin-son’s Disease Registries Act. This past month we joined forces on an amend-ment that ensures women in the mili-tary will have access to quality health services, with a specific focus on ma-ternity and preventive care. 
I will miss our talks and our collabo-
rations. But leaving the Senate will allow Senator U
DALL to become an 
even more avid outdoorsman. While he has already climbed Mt. Everest and the 100 tallest peaks in his home State of Colorado, I have no doubt that he will soon conquer new and exciting challenges in the great outdoors. 
And from listening to his farewell ad-
dress, it is already apparent to me that Senator U
DALL has achieved a clarity 
that will serve him forever after. ‘‘As a lifelong mountain climber,’’ he said, ‘‘I have learned far more from the moun-tains I did not summit, than those that I did.’’ 
I know I speak for many of us here 
when I say that I have learned a great deal from Senator U
DALL , and I thank 
him for serving Colorado and our Na-tion in the U.S. Senate—and for being a great friend. Happy trails, Senator. 
KAY HAGAN  
Mr. President, I also wish to pay trib-
ute to my dear friend and colleague, Senator K
AYHAGAN from North Caro-
lina. 
KAYHAGAN has quite a collection of 
hats. There is the hat she wore as a lawyer in Greensboro. She wore one hat as a banker, another as a State leg-islator helping to write North Caro-lina’s State budget. And when she ex-celled in each of these roles, the voters 
of North Carolina gave her another hat to wear, as their U.S. Senator. 
K
AYHAGAN joined us in January 2009, 
which was a difficult time for our Na-tion’s economy. With her background in the banking sector and her knowl-edge of the housing finance system, she got right to work on rebuilding our economy, with a stronger foundation. 
At the same time, she never allowed 
herself to be distracted from the needs specific to her North Carolina constitu-ents. She recognized that North Caro-lina workers and small businesses were being threatened by unfair trade prac-tices abroad, and she sought to address it. 
She recognizes how vital military 
bases are to North Carolina’s economy and to its culture, so she worked to protect them from cuts and closures. She was a leader for military families who care for disabled children, seeking to provide payments for them from the Survivor Benefit Plan. And it was Sen-ator H
AGAN who stepped up to help 
families at Camp Lejeune get access to health care, following one of the worst cases of water contamination in Amer-ican history. 
With two daughters of her own, Sen-
ator H
AGAN knows about the demands 
of balancing child care with a career, and as Chair of the Senate Sub-committee on Children and Families, she called attention to the need for paid leave. Senator H
AGAN and I share 
important health care priorities: She cosponsored a bill to improve the care of mothers and babies by establishing higher quality standards for maternity care through Medicaid and the Chil-dren’s Health Insurance Program. And she has been a valuable ally on the HOPE for Alzheimer’s Act, which would help doctors detect this disease earlier and provide more support for those taking care of a family member with Alzheimer’s. 
I had the distinct honor of teaming 
up with Senator H
AGAN earlier this 
year to help pork farmers get disaster assistance after a deadly virus dev-astated their livestock. And we worked together to sound the alarm on student loan debt and to try to stop interest rates on Federal loans from rising. 
We both come from States where 
hunting, fishing, and wildlife are im-portant components to residents’ qual-ity of life. So I was pleased this past year to help Senator H
AGAN push for 
her Bipartisan Sportsmen’s Act, which sought to expand access to Federal lands while taking significant steps to-ward conserving the land we use for recreation. 
I deeply regret that I will not be able 
to work with Senator H
AGAN in the 
next Congress. But knowing how dear public service is to her, and how deeply that tradition is established in her family, I have no doubt that she will find new ways to serve the people of her beloved home State, and our Na-tion.

MARY LANDRIEU  
∑Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I wish to 
recognize the many accomplishments of my friend, Senator M
ARYLANDRIEU , 
my colleague from Louisiana, during her 18 years here in the U.S. Senate. 
Senator L
ANDRIEU was elected to the 
U.S. Senate in 1996. Prior to serving in the Senate, she had already served the people of her State for 16 years—first as a State legislator, and later as a State treasurer. Altogether Senator L
ANDRIEU ’s service to the people of 
Louisiana has spanned nearly 34 years of commitment to the people of Lou-isiana. 
M
ARY served her constituents with 
utter conviction, dedication, and per-sistence—qualities that her colleagues in the U.S. Senate use to describe her. 
However, Senator L
ANDRIEU ’s dedica-
tion can be described in other ways as well. 
In her farewell remarks last week, 
Senator L
ANDRIEU discussed how faith 
and family helped drive her. She draws tremendous strength from her faith, and also her large and supportive fam-ily—a family that knows a thing or two about the ups and downs of poli-tics. 
Her father, Moon Landrieu, served as 
a judge, State representative, New Or-leans city councilman and Secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Her brother, Mitch Landrieu, was Louisiana’s Lieu-tenant Governor, and both her father and brother have served as mayors of New Orleans—her father during an era of renewal, and her brother during an era of rebuilding. 
M
ARY has clearly stepped up to the 
plate during the devastation of Hurri-cane Katrina and the horrendous BP oil spill. Those are the kinds of chal-lenges that none of us expect when we enter public life—but they are the chal-lenges which show our communities what we are made of. 
Senator L
ANDRIEU rose to both chal-
lenges. She has worked as hard as any Senator has ever worked to see that her constituents were taken care of. She has pushed hard on Federal agen-cies to help rebuild, and passed legisla-tion to help with Gulf restoration. She has also fought to see that flood insur-ance rates remain affordable—not just for those in Louisiana, but across the country. 
Her efforts have earned the respect of 
everyone she has worked with, and she earned the opportunity to serve as Chair of the Senate Energy and Nat-ural Resources Committee as well as the Senate Small Business and Entre-preneurship Committee. I know that the issues she championed on these two 
committees were important to her con-stituents and I admire her advocacy for jobs in her State and more opportuni-ties for small businesses. 
Of course, Senator L
ANDRIEU ’s work 
extended beyond these two commit-tees. For years, she worked on adop-
tion, education, conservation, and other issues that were near and dear to her heart. 
All of us will miss M
ARY’s drive, te-
nacity, and willingness to work with others to get things done. She will con-tinue to be a tough and relentless fighter for Louisiana no matter what her next challenge will be. 
Aloha, M
ARY, a hui hou, ‘‘until we 
meet again.’’ 
MARK PRYOR  
Mr. President, I wish to say a few 
words about my colleague, Senator M
ARKPRYOR of Arkansas, who will be 
ending his tenure in the Senate at the end of this Congress. 
The Pryor name is synonymous with 
public service in Arkansas. M
ARK’s fa-
ther, David, served Arkansas in the U.S. House, as Governor, and in the U.S. Senate. In fact, M
ARK succeeded 
his father in the U.S. Senate after serv-ing in the State legislature and as at-torney general. 
Throughout his two terms in the 
Senate, M
ARK has been a workhorse 
and not a showhorse. As he noted in his farewell remarks, he is not one to at-tend many press conferences. But he certainly has done a lot of work on be-half of the people of Arkansas. In 12 
years in the Senate he has worked to get 70 laws passed—many on a bipar-tisan basis. 
His work improves the lives of Amer-
icans and our youth each day—from his work in consumer product safety, ac-cess to health care, veterans issues, and more. He has fought to protect Medicare, and to support Arkansas’ farmers, small businesses, and middle class families. 
That may be why in his 2008 reelec-
tion to the Senate he earned more votes than any statewide elected offi-cial in Arkansas history. 
Senator P
RYOR told us in his farewell 
to look inside our desks and see the names written in the drawer, to see the predecessors who have come before us. These names can serve as a reminder of what we all are here for and what large shoes we must fill, as well as how we must collaborate to get things done. 
M
ARKhas spoken about the fact that 
politics is about people—both the peo-ple we serve and the people we serve with. 
While there are many good people 
serving here, we will all miss the work ethic, warmth, and charm that M
ARK 
brought to the Senate during his serv-ice. 
It has been an honor serving as his 
colleague. 
Aloha, M
ARK, a hui hou, ‘‘until we 
meet again.’’ ∑

TRIBUTE TO JOHN D. DINGELL 
∑Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I 
rise to pay tribute to an amazing col-league from my home State of Michi-gan, who has served in Congress for 59 years, the longest tenure of any Mem-ber in history: the dean of the House, J
OHND. D INGELL . In fact, his service to our Nation goes 
back even further: In 1938 he worked as a congressional page and on December 8, 1941, he was on the floor to hear President Roosevelt declare that the bombing of Pearl Harbor was a day that would live in infamy. In fact, a 15- year-old J
OHN DINGELL helped record 
that speech. 
Three years later he served America 
in Europe in the fight against Nazi Germany. He would have been in the Battle of the Bulge if he hadn’t been hospitalized with meningitis. Then he joined the fight in the Pacific, making preparations to be in the first wave of American soldiers for the ground inva-sion of Japan—except that the Japa-nese surrendered before it could hap-pen. 
So J
OHNDINGELL proved his patriot-
ism long before he joined Congress in 1955, following the death of his beloved father, who preceded him as Represent-ative for Michigan’s 15th Congressional District. 
It is hard to imagine, but Congress-
man D
INGELL was a Member of Con-
gress before Medicare and Medicaid ex-isted. In fact, he helped vote those pro-grams into law. When he joined Con-gress, the Interstate Highway System did not exist. Alaska and Hawaii were not yet States. 
Congressman D
INGELL is not merely 
a witness to history. He is a maker of it. His original family name, translated into Polish, meant ‘‘blacksmith,’’ and this is a man who hammered out our Nation’s laws, forging a stronger Union that could weather the challenges of the future. 
I would like to list all of Congress-
man D
INGELL ’s accomplishments, but I 
would be accused of staging a fili-buster. For the sake of brevity, I will list only the most exceptional mo-ments in Congressman D
INGELL ’s leg-
endary career. 
Perhaps his most courageous vote oc-
curred in 1964, in favor of the Civil Rights Act. Advisers told him that vote would destroy his chances at re-election, but he had more faith in his constituents—and he refused to com-promise the principles of social justice. 
Health care was a great passion—one 
he inherited from his father. John Din-gell, Sr., introduced a bill for universal health care in 1943, and though it failed, he continued to fight for it until the end of his life, and J
OHNDINGELL , 
Jr., adopted that cause from his first day as his father’s successor, proposing a bill to reform the health care system in every Congress since 1955. He has al-ways believed that every American should have access to health care. So I know that voting for the Affordable Care Act was one of Congressman D
IN-
GELL ’s proudest moments in Congress. 
As a boy he lived through America’s 
Great Depression, and as a Congress-man he helped to overcome America’s great recession. 
He witnessed the rise of the auto-
mobile industry and saw how those unionized workers powered the rise of

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6940 January 2, 2015 
America’s middle class. Then we fought 
together to make sure that American autos and American workers could compete with foreign competition on an even playing field. Congressman D
INGELL recognized that this was the 
key to a new golden age of American cars and trucks. We are seeing that today. 
While scientific consensus was still 
forming about threats pollution posed to our air and animals, J
OHNDINGELL  
wrote the Endangered Species Act in 1973 and the major expansion of the Clean Air Act in 1990. In 2001, he cre-ated the Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge—the very first of its kind in North America—and in the years since he has worked to expand refuge protection to more acres. 
He loves Michigan dearly. He under-
stands the connection our people have to manufacturing, to agriculture and to the land and Great Lakes that power our tourism industry and our Michigan way of life. 
Even during the years he spent 
chairing the House Committee on En-ergy and Commerce, when Congress-man Dingell was one of the most pow-erful Members of Congress, you could still find him waving to the crowd from the open top of a Ford Mustang con-vertible at Dearborn’s Memorial Day Parade or at a booth at the Monroe County Fair, always with that same big smile. As Tip O’Neill once said, ‘‘All politics is local,’’ and local people are what J
OHN DINGELL loves about 
politics. 
The people of his district never 
doubted his dedication. That is why they would still put ‘‘Dingell for Con-gress’’ signs on their lawn, long after his district boundaries had changed. If a piece of Southeast Michigan was ‘‘Dingell Country’’ once, then it was Dingell Country forever. 
And now he feels great pride—and his 
constituents feel great comfort—know-ing that the district will remain in his family’s hands. His beloved wife Debo-rah, who has been his closest confidant and understands him more intimately than anyone, will carry on his legacy long into the future. So if you go back to Congressman John Dingell, Sr., it means that Southeast Michigan has been under the Dingell name for 81 years—and counting. 
While Congressman D
INGELL will no 
longer be in Congress, we can still fol-low him on Twitter. 
Even at age 88, he is constantly 
evolving, charging boldly into the fu-ture, driven by a very simple principle: We are put on this earth to help people. 
J
OHN D. D INGELL , Jr., has helped 
many people and yet he will insist that he has received much more than he has been given. He claims to be the ‘‘luckiest man in shoe leather,’’ and we are lucky that he has served Michigan and our Nation, so long and so faith-fully. ∑ RECOGNIZING CARE CHEST OF 
SIERRA NEVADA 
∑Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today I 
wish to recognize the 25th anniversary of Care Chest of Sierra Nevada, an or-ganization that supplies free medical equipment to Northern Nevadans in need. As a provider of services to un-derserved communities, Care Chest has long been a vital nonprofit in Nevada, and I am proud of the work they do on behalf of the Silver State. 
Founded in 1990, Care Chest began as 
a grassroots effort to reuse and recycle medical equipment. Today, this organi-zation helps improve the quality of life for those who otherwise could not af-ford the rising cost of health care sup-plies. Twenty-five years later, Care Chest has served over 100,000 people in Northern Nevada. Last year alone, Care Chest served nearly 9,000 Nevad-ans and distributed over 16,000 medical items. Free of charge services provided by Care Chest include emergency pre-scriptions, diabetic supplies, res-piratory items, and liquid nutritional products. Care Chest has dedicated its efforts to the underserved communities in Northern Nevada, as 69 percent of its clients in 2013 were uninsured while 55 percent were below the poverty line. 
As Nevada’s unemployment rate re-
mains one of highest in the Nation and as health care costs continue to rise, I recognize the unique role that Care Chest has played in working to address the needs of its local community by of-fering health care services to those in need. As a lifelong Nevadan and mem-ber of the Senate Committee on Fi-nance and the Senate Special Com-mittee on Aging starting in the 114th Congress, I am proud of the work Care Chest does on behalf of the Reno com-munity and its senior citizens. 
Today, I ask my colleagues and all 
Nevadans to join me in recognizing Care Chest of Sierra Nevada, an organi-zation whose mission is both noble and charitable. I am humbled and honored to recognize Care Chest, and I wish them the best of luck in their 25th year of service to the State of Nevada. ∑

RECOGNIZING THE WELLS FUTURE 
FARMERS OF AMERICA 
∑Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, I wish 
to recognize and congratulate the Wells, NV, Future Farmers of America chapter for winning a national title in the Western National Rangeland Ca-reer Development Event. As a lifelong Nevadan and advocate of agriculture education, I am proud to celebrate this victory for Wells and for the Silver State. 
As a rancher, I recognize the role the 
Future Farmers of America organiza-tion plays in preparing students for a future in agriculture. The Western Na-tional Rangeland Convention, hosted in Elko, NV, brought 14 teams from five States to compete in various categories including plant identification, range-land biodiversity, habitat evaluation, and stocking management. With nearly 
6 million acres of farmland in the Sil-ver State, these are invaluable skills for future Nevada farmers. 
I am especially proud to recognize 
team members Wyatt Gibbs, Deseret Johnson, DeMar Gale, Chelsea James, and Justin Sorenson for representing the Wells community as leaders in rangeland farming techniques. Under the leadership of adviser Don Noorda, the Wells Future Farmers of America chapter proudly brought home Ne-vada’s first national title. As ranch owners, my wife Lynne and I under-stand the importance of agriculture education. Management of our State’s rangelands has been one of my top nat-ural resources priorities in the U.S. Senate. Recently, I was instrumental in the enactment of the Grazing Im-provement Act, which will provide much needed security to livestock pro-ducers all across the West. 
Today, I ask my colleagues and all 
Nevadans to join me in recognizing the Wells Future Farmers of America, a group of driven young adults dedicated to Nevada’s agriculture and rangeland. Their commitment to Nevada’s agri-cultural future is commendable, and I wish them the best of luck in all of their future endeavors. ∑

HONORING JOE W. STRICKLAND ON 
HIS RETIREMENT AS CHIEF REPORTER OF DEBATES 
HON. JOHN A. BOEHNER 
OF OHIO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, January 2, 2015 
Mr. BOEHNER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Joe W. Strickland, the Chief Reporter of Debates, for his contributions to the House of Representatives during almost 22 years of service. 
The House has employed Official Reporters 
of Debates since 1873, when the Speaker of the House took control of the privately-run Congressional Globe and the verbatim pro-ceedings of events were published as the C
ONGRESSIONAL RECORD —as they still are 
today. 
It was a five-man operation back then, and 
the Reporters were praised in the New York Tribune for their ‘‘intimate knowledge of the precedents and practice of the House, and of the national events, great and small, which have passed in close review before their eyes.’’ 
Joe follows in that long tradition, noted in 
the Tribune, of ‘‘superior ability’’ and ‘‘effi-ciency,’’ though the office is now under the su-pervision of the Clerk of the House and has grown to 43 people. Joe has worked diligently to achieve the daunting task of maintaining an accurate record not only of House Floor pro-ceedings but of House Committee work, as well. In addition to his managerial responsibil-ities, he has been front and center, reporting seven State of the Union speeches and sev-eral Joint Meetings to receive messages from foreign heads of state, such as Afghan Presi-dent Hamid Karzai and French President Nico-las Sarkozy. 
Joe was born in central Texas and grad-
uated from Hardin-Simmons University in Abi-lene with a degree in music. A tenor, he regu-larly toured with an all-male quartet and per-formed at conventions and competitions from Moscow to Washington, DC, including en-gagements at the White House. 
After college, Joe co-owned a travel and 
tour company and pursued several other pas-sions before turning his sights on court report-ing. Joe attended court reporting school out-side of Dallas, and he quickly earned a posi-tion as a real-time captionist for a television station. A mere three years later, his skills won him a place as an Official Reporter of De-bates for the U.S. House of Representatives, reporting both Committee and Floor debates. The Clerk of the House promoted Joe to Dep-uty Chief of the office in 2000, and he became Chief Reporter of Debates in 2005. 
Joe is recognized by the National Court Re-
porters Association as a Registered Profes-sional Reporter, a Certified Realtime Reporter, and a Certified Communication Access Realtime Translation provider—qualifications that place him among the elite in court report-ing. Mr. Speaker, the work of the Official Report-
ers of Debates has been an essential part of House operations for more than 140 years, and while the technology has changed, the dedication of the Reporters, like Joe, has not. We are sad to lose such a valuable member of the House Clerk’s team, but we wish him and his family the very best during a long and happy retirement.

THE SAVANNAH HARBOR 
EXPANSION PROJECT 
HON. JACK KINGSTON 
OF GEORGIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, January 2, 2015 
Mr. KINGSTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in 
support of the rule today. The underlying bill holds the line on spending, reducing it below the level of the past two years. Furthermore, this bill provides short term funding for the De-partment of Homeland Security and sets up an opportunity for the new Congress and Senate to repeal President Obama’s unconstitutional executive order on immigration. It also holds the line on Obamacare and prohibits taxpayer bailouts of insurance companies. In addition to these things, there are a number of conserv-ative measures I support and I want to focus on one in particular of local importance. 
This bill clarifies that the Savannah Harbor 
Expansion Project is an ongoing construction, not a new start. Therefore, the Office of Man-agement and Budget can and should fully sup-port the project in the President’s Budget. We can almost immediately begin dredging. 
In 1997, through the Energy and Water Ap-
propriations Committee, we allocated funds to support a study by the Georgia Ports Author-ity. That same year, the Georgia Ports Author-ity began a feasibility study of the project. 
In 1998, the Harbor Expansion Feasibility 
Study Report was released, underscoring the importance of the project. Senator Cleland, Senator Coverdell and I worked with House and Senate Members and Conferees to be sure SHEP was included in WRDA. The bill became known as the WRDA bill of 1999 after it was signed into law by President Clinton. WRDA of 1999 included authorization for SHEP allowing the United States Army Corps of Engineers to release the record of decision, formally beginning the project. 
The victory in WRDA never assured smooth 
sailing. Amidst growing competition from neighboring Charleston, Representative Floyd Spence, Chairman of the House Armed Serv-ices Committee, said he would ‘‘sink’’ the project [AP, March 2000]. This began an on-going battle with our neighbors from South Carolina about the port. Meanwhile, many en-vironmentalists and other groups began to raise objections. In addition, the Fish and Wildlife Service threatened to step away from negotiations. As objections came up, meetings required by WRDA with stakeholders including local Judy Jennings, economic development interests and federal agencies became an im-
portant forum to defuse concerns among all parties and resolve problems. Even with con-tinued discussions, Congress worked with the Clinton Administration to secure additional funding for the project. 
In 2001, the Georgia Ports Authority and the 
United States Army Corps of Engineers issued a Memorandum of Understanding and an-nounced that the Port of Savannah was a top ranked port and one of the fastest growing U.S. container ports. Funding was again in-creased that year, with additional funding se-cured over the President’s budget request. 
In 2002, the SHEP Project Management 
plan was released and the United States Army Corps of Engineers expressed their intent to draft another Environmental Impact Study. 
In 2004, the major commitment by Georgia, 
both financially and politically, unified our mes-sage in Washington and was instrumental in moving the project up the priority list. 
Further advancing the importance of this 
project was the approval of the Panama Canal expansion referendum in 2006. For example, in 2007, the Georgia House of Representa-tives passed H.R. 56 urging the Corps and the U.S. Congress to begin a study of the costs and effects of adding to the storage capacities of all Corps reservoirs in Georgia. Additionally, business groups, led by the Savannah Cham-ber of Commerce, ran efforts to push the project forward. 
In 2008, as new WRDA legislation was de-
bated in Congress, we again kept the project in WRDA and made sure that no amendments were allowed to adversely impact the project. 
In 2009, we worked through the appropria-
tions process to ensure funding for the Savan-nah Harbor Expansion Study in fiscal year 2010. Unfortunately, because so much time had lapsed and costs had increased, the project had to be reauthorized and adjusted each year. 
In 2010, President Obama came to Savan-
nah. Congressman B
ARROW and I had the op-
portunity to fly in Air Force One with him to discuss the project and followed up with a let-ter. He acted favorably but did not include it in the budget. 
In 2011, even though the President’s 2012 
budget did not include an allotted budget for SHEP, the Director of the Executive Office of the President’s Office of Management and Budget expressed the President’s willingness to consider the project. That same year, the U.S. Transportation Secretary noted the eco-nomic importance of the port and the need to provide funding. SHEP faced a hurdle when the Corps’ Water Qualification Certification was denied by South Carolina’s Department of Health and Environmental Control. However, by the end of the year, construction funds were secured for the project. 
In 2012, Senator I
SAKSON , Senator C HAM-
BLISS and I met with Assistant Secretary of the 
Army (Civil Works) Darcy and presented a let-ter asking for supportive language. This led to President Obama listing the Port of Savannah as a ‘‘We Can’t Wait’’ port and a legislative fix

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E1856 January 2, 2015 
to a procedural hurdle to the beginning of the 
project through the appropriations process. 
In 2013, we again asked for supportive leg-
islative language, held delegation wide meet-ings and secured a provision in WRDA to re-authorize the project at updated funding lev-els, removing any question that the project would move forward. 
This year, through work with WRDA Con-
ferees and the Appropriations Committee, SHEP finally received the final budgetary and legislative actions necessary to move forward after all of these years in the WRRDA of 2014 and the Omnibus Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2015. 
These actions, in addition to many others, 
were completed to support SHEP because it is crucial to the State of Georgia and the Port of Savannah is key to maintaining our nation’s international competitiveness. The Port of Sa-vannah’s return on investment is approxi-mately an impressive 5.5:1. As the nation’s fourth largest container port, it is critically im-portant that the harbor is deepened to ensure it continues to act as a gateway for business to Georgia and to the nation. Beyond the trade benefits, the Port of Savannah supports hun-dreds of thousands of jobs and contributes bil-lions in revenue and state and local taxes each year. Serving companies located in all 50 states, Georgia’s deep-water ports are strong economic engines for the entire United States. 
This has been a long fight that I am proud 
to have been a part of. I am hopeful with the current status of the project. Again, it was a major team effort where the entire delegation, the business community, the state legislature and several governors supported the project.

RECOGNIZING MR. BRUCE ROLAND 
ON THE OCCASION OF HIS RE-TIREMENT FROM THE OFFICE OF THE CAO 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, January 2, 2015 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I ask my col-
leagues to join me in recognizing Mr. Bruce Roland, of Clifton, Va., on the occasion of his retirement today, January 2, 2015, after more than 29 years of invaluable service to the United States House of Representatives. 
Mr. Roland began his career with the House 
in December 1985, after working six years in the private sector. He was hired by former Clerk of the House, Ben Guthrie, as a Service Coordinator for Property Supply. Mr. Roland was responsible for initiating service and deliv-ery orders and managing event setups. 
He progressed to become the Assistant Pur-
chasing Manager for the Operations Support Center, which offered an opportunity to learn new skills. Eventually, his tasks evolved into managing the budget and advocating for the financial needs of the Logistics & Support Of-fice. 
During the span of his career, Mr. Roland 
worked for the Directors of Non-Legislative and Financial Services including General Leonard Wischart and Randall Medlock. When that position was renamed the Chief Adminis-trative Officer, he worked under Scott Faulk-ner, Jeff Trandahl, Jay Eagen, Dan Beard, Dan Strodel and the current CAO, Ed Cassidy. For many years, he worked directly under 
Cosmo Quattrone and Tom Van Dyke in the Furnishings Department, lending his expertise in purchase orders, and acquiring items for the House. It soon became clear that he was pro-ficient in budget and finance, so he took that task on full-time. Eventually, he became the Budget Point of Contact for the Logistics & Support Department, working closely with Deputy CAO, Walt Edwards and Chief Logis-tics Officer, Jerry Bennett. 
Had Mr. Roland not worked for the House, 
he might have tried to become a professional golfer. He is an accomplished golfer and often played on teams fielded by the CAO for char-ity events. Mr. Roland says he now intends to enjoy a little more golf while balancing his re-sponsibilities for his three children, his daugh-ter, Antoinette, who is now in college, and twin boys, Robert and Anthony, following the pass-ing of his wife, Marguerite, in 2013. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me 
in thanking Mr. Bruce Roland for his distin-guished service and tremendous contributions to the U.S. House of Representatives. Mr. Ro-land’s duties, like those of all his colleagues within the CAO, are vital to helping make sure we are able to perform our duties as the elect-ed representatives of our communities and the nation. I want to thank Mr. Roland for his com-mitment to public service, and I wish him and his family all the best as they begin this new chapter of their lives.

CHEMICAL FACILITY ANTI-TER-
RORISM STANDARDS PROGRAM AUTHORIZATION AND ACCOUNT-ABILITY ACT OF 2014 
SPEECH OF  
HON. HENRY A. WAXMAN 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Thursday, December 11, 2014 
Mr. WAXMAN. Mr. Speaker, since before 
the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, experts have been concerned about the vul-nerability of chemical plants to attack. These facilities hold large stores of industrial chemi-cals which pose a safety and security risk to the American people if they are released or detonated. A recent report found that more than 134 million Americans live in the vulner-ability zones around chemical facilities. I have such a facility in my district, which is a very serious concern for the surrounding commu-nity. 
These risks have not been adequately ad-
dressed, and this bill falls short of what is needed. The version of the bill before us now also includes a significant and unvetted change to the program that could make many high risk chemical facilities less secure. The self-certification provisions have not been evaluated in hearings or piloted. I am con-cerned about these provisions and I caution my colleagues that their implementation will require close oversight from Congress. 
But this bill is a step forward. For far too 
long, this important program has been author-ized in the appropriations process for the De-partment of Homeland Security. During last year’s government shutdown, the authority for this program lapsed. Looking ahead to next Congress, the risk of another lapse is too great. When we voted on a previous version of this bill in July, I expressed my hope that 
the Senate could improve the legislation to strengthen this important program. 
On some issues, the Senate was success-
ful. The bill now includes an expanded role for workers and labor unions in developing site security plans and some important whistle-blower protections. 
However, this bill would leave significant 
problems in the underlying program in place. 
The Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Stand-
ards program at the Department of Homeland Security has not been successful. The original rider that created the program blocked effec-tive enforcement, leading to a lack of compli-ance. We saw the dangers of noncompliance when the West Fertilizer Company facility in West, Texas, exploded. Unfortunately, those limitations on enforcement would be preserved by this bill. 
The original statute blocked the Department 
from requiring measures to reduce the con-sequences of a terrorist attack, and in the process created serious obstacles to dis-approving site security plans that failed to meet the program’s standards. This led to an approval process so complicated that it took more than five years for the Department to complete its review of the first facility. This bill preserves those obstacles. 
Both of these challenges may be com-
plicated further by the new self-certification program. 
I expect this bill to pass today, and I wel-
come this step forward. But I call upon all of my colleagues who will be here in the next Congress to continue the important oversight of this program to provide the American peo-ple with the protection they expect and de-serve.

INSULAR AREAS AND FREELY AS-
SOCIATED STATES ENERGY DE-VELOPMENT 
SPEECH OF  
HON. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN 
OF MARYLAND  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Thursday, December 11, 2014 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to oppose this omnibus. It is critical to avoid another unnecessary and wasteful government shutdown, and I strongly believe that we must do that without extraneous and harmful policy riders. 
The bill before us holds government oper-
ations hostage to a number of highly partisan, noxious policy riders. By proposing to repeal the so-called ‘‘swaps push out rule’’ enacted under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform law, it caters to the demands of big banks and puts taxpayers on the hook for their risky decisions. It allows special interests to funnel more money into Congressional political party com-mittees, dramatically increasing the limit from $129,600 to $777,600 per year, or over $1.5 million per election cycle. Putting these provi-sions together will simply breed additional public cynicism about Congress granting spe-cial favors to powerful special interests in ex-change for increased political contributions. 
I also continue to oppose riders related to 
Guantanamo and those that meddle in the local business of the District of Columbia. 
The fact that this bill only funds the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security through February

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E1857 January 2, 2015 
is nothing more than a political stunt by my 
colleagues across the aisle. Instead of working to fix our broken immigration system, House Republicans have signaled that they are will-ing to shut down the Department of Homeland Security even though this will do nothing to prevent President Obama from expanding the deferred action program. 
This bill also provides $5 billion in funding 
for the deployment of an additional 1,500 American troops to Iraq and up to $500 million to train and equip the so-called ‘‘moderate’’ Syrian rebels. As I outlined in my statement on the NDAA, Congress should have had the opportunity to amend those provision. I do not want us to be dragged into Iraq War 2.0 or more deeply into the Syrian civil war. 
Without the inclusion of these measures, I 
would have been pleased to support a number of provisions in this bill. As a representative of many federal employees, I appreciate the one percent COLA for our dedicated federal work-force and pay adjustments for wage grade employees. I support the additional funding for the Na-
tional Institutes of Health, although we must do much more to support medical research. The bill also increases funding the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and provides emergency funding to address the ongoing Ebola crisis. It includes important funding for scientific research at NIST and the National Science Foundation, and rejects the House- passed rider that would have defunded climate change research. I support the investments in education, including Title I and IDEA, although more funding for these programs is necessary to support our nation’s students. 
The bill also includes critical funding for in-
frastructure, including $2.1 billion to build new transit lines, $500 million for TIGER grants for projects of national significance, and $150 mil-
lion to allow the Washington area Metro sys-tem to make recommended safety and per-formance improvements. 
This legislation also builds on efforts made 
in last year’s MilCon-VA bill to end the claims backlog that continues to plague our VA re-gional offices, including the VA’s Baltimore Regional Office. It includes $2.5 billion for the 
costs of processing disability claims—an in-crease of $40 million over the President’s re-quest and $69 million over last year’s level. 
I am pleased that this bill provides $73 mil-
lion in funding for the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. This will help pro-vide Maryland with the necessary resources to implement the technology to automate criminal history and mental health records in our back-ground check system. This legislation also fully funds many other important Department of Justice Programs, including $376 million for Byrne Justice Assistance Grants and $430 million for Violence Against Women programs. 
Mr. Speaker, I recognize that no bill of this 
magnitude is perfect. However, I cannot in good conscience vote to roll back critical tax-payer protections and allow monied special in-terests to buy more influence in Congress. We should strip these damaging provisions from the bill and pass an omnibus that works on behalf of taxpayers and strengthens the mid-dle class.
