PRAYER Reverend Harvey Sparks, Temple Hills Baptist Church, Temple Hills, Maryland, offered the following prayer: Father, Your Word tells us that blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked nor stands in the way of sinners nor sits in the seat of scoffers; but his delight is in the law of the Lord, and on His law he meditates day and night. Father, as we begin a new year that is full of both promise and hope, may we be a people who seek Your righteous wisdom. May we reject the sins of self-ishness, greed, and pride. May we avoid apathy, ridicule, and division. This new year help us to seek Your truth and submit ourselves to Your law so that we might experience the rich blessings of Christ. Regardless of what challenges the new year holds, let us not lose hope be-cause Christ has defeated the grave. It is in His holy and precious name that we pray. Amen.

HONORING JENNIFER STONE 
HON. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM 
OF NEW MEXICO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, January 4, 2016 Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a constituent and long-time colleague, Jennifer Stone. Jennifer represents the best of our great State of New Mexico: she is a loving parent, a loyal friend to so many, a brilliant, hardworking and talented professional, and a dedicated member of her community. She is also my dear friend. Jennifer was born in Los Alamos, New Mex-ico on November 1, 1965, to Peggy and Sid Pinkston. In 1985, she was the Grand Worthy Advisor of the State of New Mexico for the Order of Rainbow for Girls, an organization dedicated to empowering young women with leadership, public speaking, project manage-ment, teamwork and interpersonal commu-nication skills. Jennifer was always a brilliant student. In 1983, she graduated a year early from Los Al-amos High School and then enrolled in the University of New Mexico where she met her future husband, Chip Stone, and subsequently graduated in 1988. While an undergraduate, Jennifer worked full time from 5 p.m. to 12 a.m. at the Rodey Law Firm, one of Albuquer-que’s oldest and most prestigious firms. Somehow, Jennifer found the energy to work until midnight, go home, do her homework, sleep a little, and then wake up fresh for an-other day while maintaining a full course load. After graduating, she attended the University of New Mexico School of Law, and on the first day of her third year, her son Jordan was born. During that third year of law school, in addition to being a new mother, Jennifer was also the Lead Articles Editor for the New Mex-ico Law Review from 1990–1991. In 1991, Jennifer graduated cum laude, Order of the Coif, and was the University’s recipient of the Outstanding Clinical Law Student Award. Fol-lowing graduation, her impressive legal career included being: an associate at the Rodey Law Firm (where she had previously clerked during the summers while she attended law school), an Assistant Attorney General for the State of New Mexico, in-house counsel for the Sun Healthcare Group, a partner at the Miller Law Firm, and General Counsel and Deputy Cabinet Secretary for the New Mexico Depart-ment of Health. She then returned to her be-loved Rodey Law Firm, where she remains a partner and shareholder. I met Jennifer through our children and their schools and our families have been close ever since. I even had the opportunity to work pro-fessionally with Jennifer when she was Gen-eral Counsel and Deputy Cabinet Secretary for the New Mexico Department of Health while I was serving as the Secretary of the Department. I already knew that Jennifer was a gifted legal writer and researcher, but she proved to be the best teammate I could have ever asked for. Jennifer managed all litigation brought against the Department and provided me with stellar advice and penetrating wisdom on how to better operate the Department. Her intellect, professionalism, and passion enabled us to help many New Mexicans. Jennifer is listed in The Best Lawyers in America and Southwest Super Lawyers for her expertise and experience in healthcare law. In 2009, Jennifer was selected by New Mexico Business Weekly as one of New Mexico’s ‘‘Best of the Bar.’’ Jennifer has had an out-standing legal career and New Mexico is fortu-nate to have her. Chip and Jennifer married on May 30, 1987, and have two wonderful children. Jordan, 25, lives and works in Denver, and Caitlin is a 22- year-old senior at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology. On December 15, 2015, Caitlin gave birth to Jennifer and Chip’s first grandchild, a beautiful girl named Catarina Elyse Martinez. Jennifer has many hobbies. She took up knitting in middle school and became a world class knitter, making beautiful creations for friends and family. Jennifer and Chip traveled frequently to Grateful Dead concerts prior to Jerry Garcia’s death in 1995, and have col-lected Grateful Dead and rock poster art for decades. In recent years, Jennifer and Chip have been devoted to indoor and outdoor rock climbing. Jennifer has remained steadfast in her de-termination to bring good things to our com-munity despite the burdens of living with ovar-ian cancer. Even while undergoing cancer treatments, Jennifer participated in the HERA Women’s Cancer Foundation’s Climb4Life in Boulder, Colorado, to raise funds for research to eliminate ovarian cancer. That year, Jen-nifer was the only participant who climbed out-doors in Boulder Canyon, despite active can-cer treatment. This came as no surprise to me as she is one of the most determined and en-ergetic people I know. Jennifer is one of my oldest and dearest friends. It has been difficult to watch such a close friend, so loving a mother, such a skilled and hard-working colleague, and such a dedi-cated member of our community struggle with this terrible disease. I cherish our friendship and all of the wonderful contributions she has made to our state.

HONORING CLIFF KOROLL 
HON. MIKE QUIGLEY 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, January 4, 2016 Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Cliff Koroll, a Chicago Blackhawks legend. Cliff Koroll is a Canadian Ukrainian born in Canora, Saskatchewan, Canada. He played his youth hockey for the Saskatoon Wesleys and helped them win a Provincial Champion-ship. Cliff continued his education with his childhood friend Keith Magnuson at the Uni-versity of Denver. Both players were standouts and were key factors in winning the NCAA Championship for Denver University. Both Cliff Koroll and Keith Magnuson signed with the Blackhawks in 1969. Cliff played 11 seasons in the NHL, all with the Chicago Blackhawks and became their Assistant Coach for six seasons. I believe Cliff to be one of the proudest players to wear the Blackhawks sweater. Cliff is the current President of the Chicago Blackhawks Alumni Association, a group of re-tired Blackhawks players that give back to the Chicago community. Throughout the hard work and dedication of the late President, Keith Magnuson, and other key individuals, the Chicago Blackhawks Alumni Association has become a huge success, giving over one million dollars in college scholarships to the most deserving high school hockey players in Illinois. The group is also very supportive of the Ronald McDonald House. Cliff has also been supportive to the Chi-cago Legal Clinic, which has a thirty-four year history of providing legal services to the poor and elderly in the Chicago area. While serving a host of legal needs, the Clinic focuses on vulnerable populations, such as immigrants, the disabled, victims of domestic violence, those facing foreclosure, children in the midst of divorce, consumers with serious debt issues, and those confronting urban environ-mental problems. Cliff has been inducted into the Saskatch-ewan Sports Hall of Fame, Saskatoon Sports Hall of Fame, The Chicago Sports Hall of Fame, Illinois Amateur Hockey Hall of Fame, the University of Denver Hall of Fame, and the Ukrainian National Museum in Chicago. I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring and celebrating his work and accomplishments. SENATE COMMITTEE MEETINGS Title IV of Senate Resolution 4, agreed to by the Senate of February 4, 1977, calls for establishment of a sys-tem for a computerized schedule of all meetings and hearings of Senate com-mittees, subcommittees, joint commit-tees, and committees of conference. This title requires all such committees to notify the Office of the Senate Daily Digest—designated by the Rules Com-mittee—of the time, place and purpose of the meetings, when scheduled and any cancellations or changes in the meetings as they occur. As an additional procedure along with the computerization of this infor-mation, the Office of the Senate Daily Digest will prepare this information for printing in the Extensions of Remarks section of the C
ONGRESSIONAL RECORD  on Monday and Wednesday of each week. Meetings scheduled for Tuesday, Jan-uary 5, 2016 may be found in the Daily Digest of today’s R
