HONORING RONALD SYLVESTRI 
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 9, 2018 Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, Saint Joseph’s Medical Center located in my district will host its annual Ball on November 3 and has cho-sen an outstanding slate of honorees for the event. One of those wonderful honorees, Ron-ald Sylvestri, has been working to improve the community for many years. Ron was born in Yonkers on September 1, 1942. He attended Yonkers schools and at-tended C.W. Post College, LIU, graduating with a B.S. degree in Business in 1966. He is a distinguished alumnus and has served as a member of Long Island University’s Board of Trustees since 1975. He is a recipient of the University’s Chancellor’s Award, the C.W. Post President’s Medal. Ron was Senior Vice President/Regional Manager of Hudson Valley Bank, New York City and formerly held high level executive posts with Fleet Bank Investment Group, Barclays Bank of New York and D.B.G. Devel-opment Corporation. He was a Charter Mem-ber of the Board of Directors of the Council of Governing Boards (CGB) since its founding in 1976. After having served in leadership posi-tions as its Secretary and Vice Chairman, Ron became Chairman of CGB in 2005. Through-out, he led with dedication, tenacity and merit. At Saint Joseph’s, Ron serves as the Vice Chairman of St. Joseph’s Health Fund. His ex-tensive knowledge and expertise in banking and finance have been a tremendous asset to Saint Joseph’s Medical Center. He has also been Vice Chairman of the Friends of Saint Dominic’s Foundation since its formation in 2005 and chaired Saint Dominic’s Golf Tour-nament for the past 25 years. Saint Dominic’s dedicated the ‘‘Sylvestri Residence’’ in Rock-land County for mentally challenged women in 1998.

Con-gratulations to him on the occasion. ON THE TRAGEDY IN THE THOU-SAND OAKS, CALIFORNIA WHICH CLAIMED THE LIVES OF TWELVE INNOCENTS LOST IN A SENSE-LESS MASS SHOOTING 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 9, 2018 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in sadness over the latest mass shooting, which occurred Wednesday evening, November 7, in Thousand Oaks, California when an armed 29-year-old man walked into the Borderline Bar & Grill in Thousand Oaks, California, opened fire, and killed 12 persons, including a 29-year veteran of the Ventura County Sher-iff’s Department who was on the eve of retire-ment. The location of the shooting is especially tragic because the Borderline Bar & Grill was a sanctuary for survivors of last year’s Las Vegas mass shooting—which ended the lives of 58 people—to gather and reflect in fellow-ship and support, following the horror of that night. I am grateful to all first-responders for their quick work in containing this tragedy, including their valiance in limiting the loss of life. As has now almost become commonplace, a community will begin the process of mourn-ing those lost, and burying those who per-ished. Then, before long, the country will return to life as normal, forgetting what transpired just outside of Los Angeles Wednesday night. Beyond the horror of last night, Americans from across the nation and from all walks of life must consider that this is the 307th mass shooting event on the 311th day of this cal-endar year. It comes less than two weeks after a gun-man fueled by hate entered the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh and killed 11 parish-ioners in what constituted the largest hate crime against Jews in the history of the United States. Americans are not more mentally-ill than citizens from other countries; we are not inde-pendently more prone to gun violence more than citizens from other countries; nor are the movies we watch and the music we listen to more violent than other comparable societies or countries. The common thread through all of these shootings is the ready, easy access to fire-arms, ammunition, and weapons of war. If we are to tackle this problem, we must be clear-eyed about the cause and harbor the re-solve to forge a solution. Congress and leaders throughout the nation must tackle this scourge and stem the tide of gun violence in the country. If we do not, we are destined to be little more than helpless bystanders, and our citi-zens will continue to suffer and die. On October 24, 2018, in Louisville, Ken-tucky, a man fatally shot Maurice E. Stallard, inside a supermarket, and then killed Vickie Lee Jones, in the parking lot outside. Both were grandparents. There was no provocation to the killings, and the suspect was apprehended. He is white, and his two victims were Afri-can American. He had no connection to either victim, or the supermarket where he committed his murders. Reports indicate that prior to the shootings, the suspect attempted but failed to enter a nearby black church. Three of the deadliest mass shootings in American history have occurred within the last year, including one in a church in Sutherland Springs, in my home state of Texas. In early November of 2017, twenty-six peo-ple were killed at First Baptist Church in rural Sutherland Springs, Texas, authorities said. The church attacker was identified as 26- year-old Devin Patrick Kelley of New Braunfels, Texas. Kelley was a former member of the U.S. Air Force charged in military court in 2012 on sus-picion of assaulting his spouse and their child. Kelley received a bad conduct discharge, confinement for 12 months, and was demoted to E–1, or airman basic. On the day of the attack, Kelley dressed in all-black ‘‘tactical-type gear’’ and was wearing a ballistic vest and was armed with two weap-ons, a rifle and a handgun. Kelley purchased the gun he used in the church shooting, a Ruger AR–556 rifle, in April 2016 from an Academy Sports + Outdoors store in San Antonio. Earlier this year, a 17-year-old student armed with a shotgun and a pistol stormed Santa Fe High School, about 30 miles south-east of Houston, and opened fire in an art class, officials said. The gunman killed 10 people and wounded at least 10 others, including a school resource officer who was left in critical condition, police said, before surrendering to the officers who confronted him. Of those killed, eight were students and two were teachers, Santa Fe Independent School District Superintendent Leigh Wall said in a letter to parents. The mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, which occurred in early February, was the eighteenth such mass shooting event in the first month-and-a-half of 2018. The gunman, 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz, was believed to have been armed with an AR–15- style semi-automatic rifle and multiple maga-zines. Six months prior to the Parkland shooting, the FBI was alerted after a YouTube user named ‘‘Nikolas Cruz’’ posted a comment stat-ing ‘‘I’m going to be a professional school shooter’’ on the video site YouTube. We see that these domestic terrorists have chosen to attack Americans in all facets of our daily lives. This year alone 328 Americans have died and 1,251 Americans have been injured in mass shootings around the country.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD —Extensions of RemarksE1502 November 9, 2018 
The United States has 46 percent of the global firearms available for public use but only 4 percent of the global population. Social media has created a new avenue for bullying through cyber bullying thus creating a new set of mental health issues for profes-sionals around the country to diagnose. I fervently encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to develop a bipartisan agenda to draft legislation aimed at protecting our families and children from the careless possession and usage of guns in this country.

TRIBUTE TO THE HONORABLE MIKE ENNIS 
HON. KEVIN McCARTHY 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 9, 2018 Mr. M
CCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today, along with my colleague, D
EVIN NUNES , to rec- ognize Tulare County Supervisor Mike Ennis. This year, Mike is retiring from his position on the Tulare County Board of Supervisors fol-lowing a career of 12 years of service to his community. Born and raised in California, Mike has spent 60 years living in the City of Porterville. He attended Porterville High School, Porter-ville Junior College, and General Motors Uni-versity of Automotive Management. Taking what he learned at school and college, Mike became an accomplished businessman and worked in the private sector, including for Faggart Buick and GMC. Mike was elected to represent Tulare Coun-ty’s Fifth Supervisorial District in 2006, and has represented the communities of Spring-ville, Terra Bella, Alpine, Ducor, Camp Nelson, California Hot Springs, Posey, Kennedy Mead-ows, Ponderosa, and Sequoia Crest. During his tenure on the Board of Supervisors, Mike has accrued a long list of accomplishments, including his work to secure funds for a new prison complex and new roads as part of the state’s ‘‘Safe Routes to Schools’’ program in our community, as well as establishing the first mental health clinic, Porterville Wellness Cen-ter, in the area. Mike has also been a tireless advocate for enlarging Success Reservoir by widening and raising the spillway. After nearly a decade of delay by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, we were proud to work with Mike in leading the community effort to get this critical project back on track. We recently secured full fund-ing from the Army Corps to complete the Suc-cess Reservoir Enlargement Project, marking the beginning of the end of this long and sto-ried project, which will bring additional water supplies and recreation opportunities to our community. Mike has also been an active member of the Tulare County Association of Governments (TCAG), traveling to Washington to advocate for critical road, bridge, and infra-structure projects in our community, as well as for commonsense reforms to byzantine Fed-eral transportation policies and programs to help get projects to construction expeditiously. Among his accomplishments with TCAG have been the critical rehabilitations of State Routes 190 and 65, which are key transportation arte-ries in Tulare County. He also worked with us to reform National Forest management poli-cies to reduce the risk of catastrophic fires that can threaten the Giant Sequoias, impor-tant natural wonders that bring visitors from around the world to Tulare County. Outside of his work on the Tulare County Board of Supervisors, Mike is active in the local community, counting himself as a Char-ter Member of the Springville Siena Sunrise Rotary Club, the co-chair of the Porterville Fair Sales Committee, and a leader in the commu-nity’ s local4–H program for 27 years, not to mention being a past member of the Porter-ville Noon Rotary. We have enjoyed working with Mike over the years, and always appreciated his insight, counsel, and advice on the important issues facing Tulare County. As Mike retires, he can rest assured that he has left an indelibly posi-tive mark in our community, and we have been honored to call him a friend. On behalf of a grateful community, we wish Mike, his wife Diane, and their family all the best as he begins this new chapter of his life. f 
RECOGNIZING GARTON TRACTOR 
HON. JEFF DENHAM 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 9, 2018 Mr. DENHAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Garton Tractor for their induction into the Ag Hall of Fame as the 2018 Legend of Agriculture by the National AG Science Center. Garton Tractor is a 4th generation, family owned business that has been in operation since 1954 in and around the Central Valley, providing agricultural machinery to their cus-tomers. They pride themselves on quality product and service and assisting the agricul-tural industry. Garton Tractor has nine different locations that range from Ukiah to Merced. The family is also deeply involved in giving back, sup-porting local charities that work to improve education and the quality of life in their local communities. Since its official opening over six decades ago, Garton Tractor has thrived in the Central Valley. They have become a bedrock of our local agricultural community. Their service to the farm families has expanded and improved over the years, and we are proud to acknowl-edge their most recent achievement. Mr. Speaker, please join me in congratu-lating Garton Tractor for their significant con-tributions to agriculture and their induction in the AG Hall of Fame.

HONORING DIWALI 
HON. MIKE COFFMAN 
OF COLORADO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 9, 2018 Mr. COFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to recognize Diwali, a festival of lights cele-brating the Hindu New Year. Originating in India, Diwali is the largest and one of the most important celebrations observed within the Hindu religion. Diwali’s festival of lights sym-bolizes the spiritual victory of light over dark-ness, good over evil, and knowledge over ig-norance. Diwali festivities include deep cleaning and extensive decorating of office buildings, tem-ples, and homes. The celebration begins by lighting clay lamps in temple windows in honor of Lakshmi, the Hindu goddess of prosperity and wealth. Traditional Indian feasts take place with friends and loved ones, during which, sweets and presents are prepared and shared. The significance of this event is not exclu-sive to India. Today, where there are Hindus they honor their traditions and observe this im-portant day. Here in Colorado, for example, we have a thriving and growing Hindu commu-nity. The Hindu Temple and Cultural Center of the Rockies located in the City of Littleton and the 6th Congressional District exemplifies this. It is with great pride that I join all in recog-nizing President Sudhir Verma and Vice Presi-dent Sridhar Talanki of the Hindu Temple and Cultural Center of the Rockies also known as the Hindu Temple of Colorado, and I wish them and all the Temple’s members, well as they celebrate Diwali. f 
GUN VIOLENCE 
HON. ROBIN L. KELLY 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 9, 2018 Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today because Americans are still dying from gun violence, in our cities and towns, villages and rural communities. Despite the fact that 93 Americans are shot and killed, each and every day, this House— controlled by Republicans—have done nothing to stop the violence. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle offer ‘‘thoughts and prayers’’ while doing noth-ing so they can collect those NRA checks. Mr. Speaker, how did this happen? How did this House become so beholden to the gun lobby that the death of children fails to inspire us to stand up, speak out and act? Mr. Speaker, I include in the R
ECORD the names of 250 Americans—many of whom are children—who’ve been shot in America. These are Americans that this House, this Congress has failed.

THANK YOU TO GENERAL CHARLES F. ‘‘CHUCK’’ WALD 
HON. MICHAEL T. McCAUL 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 9, 2018 Mr. M
CCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the retirement of General Charles F. ‘‘Chuck’’ Wald (USAF, Ret.) from Deloitte Services, LP. Having served in the United States Air Force for 35 years as a command pilot with more than 3,600 flying hours and 430 combat hours, rising to the ranks of four- star general, and then going to advise top De-partment of Defense officials, he is a true pa-triot. General Wald earned his commission in the United States Air Force (USAF) through the Air Force ROTC program in 1971 at North Da-kota State University. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree in pre-law from North Dakota State University, and earned his Master’s De-gree in International Relations from Troy Uni-versity. He has completed coursework at Har-vard University and the National War College. He has also been awarded an Honorary Doc-tor of Laws degree from North Dakota State University. General Wald served combat time as an O– 2A forward air controller in Vietnam and as an F–16 pilot flying over Bosnia, in addition to serving as a T–37 instructor pilot and F–15 flight commander. During his tenure in the USAF he also served as the Chief of the U.S. Air Force Combat Terrorism Center, Support Group Commander, Operations Group Com-mander, and Special Assistant to the Chief of Staff for the Quadrennial Defense Review. He was the Director of Strategic Planning and Policy at Headquarters U.S. Air Force, served on the Joint Staff as the Vice Director for Stra-tegic Plans and Policy, and was the U.S. Air Force Deputy Chief of Staff for the Air and Space Operations at the Pentagon. His tenure in the USAF was matched by top leadership positions that catapulted him to success within the organization. In September 2001, as the Supporting Com-mander, General Wald led the development of the coalition air campaign in Operation Endur-ing Freedom, including the idea of embedding tactical air control parties in ground special op-erations forces which resulted in the elimi-nation of Taliban forces in Afghanistan. This was a critical mission for U.S. national security following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. In his last position with the USAF, General Wald served as Deputy Commander of U.S. European Command (USEUCOM) from 2002 until his retirement in July 2006. In this posi-tion, he was responsible for U.S. forces oper-ating across 91 countries in Europe, Africa, Russia, parts of Asia, the Middle East, and most of the Atlantic Ocean. This position was of paramount responsibility and General Wald demonstrated his expertise and passion for ensuring U.S. interests abroad by imple-menting the European Command Strategic Plan that included energy assurance and sustainment for the EUCOM Area of Respon-sibility (AOR). General Wald currently serves as the Vice Chairman and Senior Advisor for Government and Public Services Practice at Deloitte Serv-ices, LP. In this role, he is responsible for pro-viding senior leadership in strategy and rela-tionships with the U.S. Department of De-fense. Given his long-time commitment to the USAF, he is a subject matter specialist in weapons procurement and deployment, counterterrorism, and international energy se-curity policy. General Wald has been honored with nu-merous military awards and decorations, in-cluding the Defense Distinguished Service Medal, Distinguished Flying Cross, Air Medal, Defense Superior Service Medal, and several others. His distinguished career reflects his commitment to a life of service to our great nation and the American people. Mr. Speaker, I invite my colleagues to join me in thanking General Wald for his life-long service, sacrifice, and commitment to our na-tion, and wish him the very best of luck as he sets forth on the next chapter of his life.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 9, 2018 Mr. M
CCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today, along with my colleague, D
EVIN NUNES , to rec- ognize Tulare County Supervisor Steve Worthley. This year, Steve is retiring from his position on the Tulare County Board of Super-visors, where he currently serves as chairman, following two decades of service to his com-munity. Born and raised in Tulare County, Steve graduated from Dinuba Union High School in 1971 as valedictorian, earned a degree in his-tory from Occidental College, and got his law degree at the University of the Pacific. He started practicing law in 1978 and opened his own firm, where he still practices law, in 1981. Steve was elected to the Tulare County Board of Supervisors in 1998, and represents the communities across the northern part of Tulare County, including Dinuba, Cutler Orosi, Woodlake, Ivanhoe, Goshen, and Visalia. These cities are part of a keystone region of California’s Central Valley, an area famous for its rich legacy of leadership in our nation’s ag-ricultural industry. Recognizing the importance that life-giving water plays in our community, Steve has been a tireless advocate for the Temperance Flat Reservoir project, which will improve water supplies and availability for local farmers and Central Valley and Tulare County commu-nities. In fact, he serves as the President of the San Joaquin Valley Water Infrastructure Board, which is dedicated to developing fund-ing sources for the Temperance Flat Reservoir project. Steve also understands that the Se-quoia National Forest and the Giant Sequoias are critical to the local economy, bringing tour-ists from all over the country and world to see these natural wonders. As a Tulare County Supervisor, he has helped lead the fight to en-sure our National Forests are healthy and managed in a fashion that can reduce the threat of catastrophic fires, which can threaten the Giant Sequoias, release pollution into the air we breathe, and damage the Sequoia Na-tional Forest’s critical watershed. Steve is also a former chairman and member of the Gov-erning Board of the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District, where he has been a consistent voice for commonsense reforms to the myriad of Federal air pollution regula-tions, all the while continuing to clean up the air we breathe. Outside of his official duties with Tulare County, Steve is locally known for his mem-bership and leadership as a past president of the Dinuba Elementary School Board, as well as for his active role in Dinuba’s Rotary Club and at his church, Dinuba Christian Church. Steve retires leaving a lasting positive mark on our community, and we will forever be grateful for his advice, insights, and counsel over the years to advance the interests of Tulare County. He will be remembered fondly in Tulare County for his tireless dedication to his constituents and his advocacy on the issues that impacted them the most. As Steve begins this new chapter of his life, we wish him, his wife, Vicki Lyn, and his four children all the best. f

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 9, 2018 Mr. COFFMAN.

within the Aurora community since its incep-tion in 1968. In 1968, Aurora’s first community service agency was created then by a group of women and several church organizations. These pioneers recognized the needs of the less fortunate members of our community, and they created this remarkable organization to address those needs. Back then, Aurora Inter-faith Community Services initiated the collec-tion of food, clothing, and other supplies for distribution. The Aurora Interfaith Community Services still provides these services today. I would also like to recognize the executive director, Judith M. Barrow, Ph.D., and the vol-unteers and staff of the Aurora Interfaith Com-munity Service. I congratulate them and their predecessors for all they have done for Aurora over the past 50 years and I look forward to seeing how Aurora Interfaith Community Serv-ices will continue to serve those in need for the next 50 years. It is an honor to recognize all for their dedi-cated service to our entire community in Au-rora, Colorado.

CELEBRATING THE 2018 AG BUSI-NESS OF THE YEAR: AGRIAN, INC. 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 9, 2018 Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise alongside my colleague, D
AVID VALADAO , to commemo-rate Agrian, Inc. as the Fresno Chamber of Commerce’s 2018 Baker Peterson Franklin Ag Business of the Year. Agrian, Inc. has devoted itself to providing innovative and creative solu-tions to some of farming’s most pertinent issues, and thus is a fitting recipient of this award. Since its founding in Clovis, California in 2004, Agrian, Inc. has striven to provide con-sistent documentation for growers, agronomists, crop advisors, retailers and food processors. Utilizing their software, Agrian pro-vides compliance, agronomy, precision farm-ing, sustainability and analytic tools to local farmers in the Central Valley. Because of the leadership of cofounder and CEO Nishan Majarian and President Richard Machado, Agrian has become the first agri-culture software company to operate cloud- based software, creating a paradigm shift in the industry and significantly increasing docu-mentation efficiencies. Additionally, Agrian, Inc. has expanded internationally to Armenia and Nepal. Due to this expansion, its software has documented over one billion acres and has over 200,000 users. If that wasn’t impres-sive enough, Agrian has built the largest crop protection label database in the world with 11,000 manufacturer-reviewed labels. In recent years, Agrian has continued to demonstrate its independent leadership while recognizing the value of establishing meaning-ful partnerships. They have been a steadfast supplier of local organizations such as the Central California Food Bank, Marjoree Mason Center, Philip Patino School of Entrepreneur-ship, the Planet Foundation and City of Clovis community policing. Agrian is also committed to preparing future leaders of agriculture. Agrian has an internship program with Fresno State, which offers students the opportunity to gain firsthand knowledge in the industry. Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I ask my colleagues to join me and Mr. VALADAO in honoring Agrian, Inc. as the Fres-no Chamber of Commerce’s 2018 Baker Peterson Franklin Ag Business of the Year. Congratulations to the entire Agrian team for receiving this special award. I ask that you join me in wishing them continued success.

HONORING GARY HEITZLER 
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 9, 2018 Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, Saint Joseph’s Medical Center located in my district hosted its annual Ball on November 3 and chose an out-standing slate of honorees for the event. One of those wonderful honorees is Doctor Gary Heitzler, a very active member on the Hos-pital’s Medical Board. A D.D.S., Dr. Heitzler is a product of the New York City public school system and re-ceived a scholarship and graduated from CUNY at Queens College. While at dental school, he was very active in community out-reach programs and assisted in providing edu-cation and much needed dental care to many underserved communities on Long Island. He received the American Dental Association’s Children’s Dentistry and Service Award upon graduating from dental school. Wanting to continue his efforts in providing education and dental care to the underserved, Dr. Heitzler decided to complete a two-year Pediatric Den-tal residency at Brookdale Medical Center lo-cated in Brooklyn, New York. He received his Certificate in Pediatric Dentistry in 1994 and opened his own practice that same year in Westchester County. As his private practice grew, Dr. Heitzler re-alized that he still was not reaching the pedi-atric population that most needed quality pedi-atric dental care. He reached out to Saint Jo-seph’s Medical Center as the hospital had the reputation of providing quality healthcare to the community and never turning any patient away who needed help. In February 2001, Saint Joseph’s Medical Center and Dr. Heitzler opened the hospital’s first ever Pedi-atric Dental Center. The practice grew very rapidly as this much-needed service was wel-comed by the community. Now, in 2018, Den-tistry For Children at Saint Joseph’s Medical Center has over 17,000 active patients, ten dental chairs, a staff of over twenty and count-less happy parents and children. In addition to the hospital-based practice, Dr. Heitzler maintains two other pediatric den-tal practices located in Hastings-on-Hudson, NY and Peekskill, NY. Outside of work, he re-sides in Briarcliff Manor with his wife Melissa, and their three children; Jenna, Spencer and Jackson. I want to take the opportunity to congratu-late Dr. Heitzler on this auspicious occasion and, on behalf of New York’s 16th Congres-sional District, thank him for all the fine work he has done to improve the lives of people in the community. CONGRATULATING MR. MICHAEL CARRIGAN ON BEING RECOG-NIZED AS A ROVING AMBAS-SADOR FOR PEACE BY THE WORLD PEACE PRIZE AWARDING COUNCIL HON. DANIEL LIPINSKI 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 9, 2018 Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Mr. Michael Carrigan, President of the Illinois AFL–CIO, for being recognized as a Roving Ambassador for Peace by the World Peace Prize Awarding Council. Mr. Carrigan joins an impressive list of leaders who have been honored by the Council, in-cluding Ronald Reagan, Mahatma Gandhi, and Yitzhak Rabin. When he is formally com-mended on November 8, Mr. Carrigan will be the first Illinois resident to receive this honor. Throughout his career, Mr. Carrigan has worked tirelessly on behalf of working families and all Illinoisans. His understanding of state and local politics, and a strong grasp of labor issues, helped him rise through the ranks as an official with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. As Mr. Carrigan’s respon-sibilities grew, his good reputation spread, and in 2007 he was unanimously elected by the Il-linois AFL–CIO executive board to be the or-ganization’s president. The broad base of sup-port for Mr. Carrigan’s leadership dem-onstrates his credentials as an effective leader and his ability to work collaboratively and build coalitions. Earlier in his career Mr. Carrigan also served our community as an elected offi-cial, through his 13 years on the Decatur City Council and as mayor. Speaking about Mr. Carrigan’s accomplish-ments, Fr. Sean McManus, Chief Judge of the World Peace Prize Awarding Council, notes the relationship between peace and the labor movement. I share this sentiment, as I believe that standing up for better conditions for all workers helps to lift up societies across the world. Mr. Carrigan’s record of service for Illi-nois workers is an exemplary model for those who wish to dedicate themselves to this cause. I am pleased to have known Mike throughout my tenure in Congress and call him a friend. I’ve witnessed his hard work and focus on the needs of all working families first-hand. I ask my colleagues to join me in congratu-lating Mr. Michael Carrigan on this outstanding accomplishment and on his record of leader-ship that led to this recognition. Illinois workers are fortunate to be represented by such a leader, and I wish Mr. Carrigan continued suc-cess.

OF MISSOURI

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD —Extensions of RemarksE1506 November 9, 2018 
Mr. Cannon was born on February 22, 1924 in St. Joseph, Missouri. He was called to serve in World War II in 1942, where he left his home state for the first time in his life. He studied basic air supply and aircraft construc-tion in Florida and went on to receive special-ized training on the B–29 Superfortress, which contained a remote-control turret and gunner. During a raid on Tokyo in March 1945, he began serving as a Technical Sargent and gunner on the Salvo Sally B–29. On April 28, 1945, Salvo Sally was shot down in Southern Japan into the Pacific Ocean with twelve men aboard. Mr. Cannon was the only survivor. Adrift in enemy territory, with only a ‘‘Mae West’’ life jacket, Mr. Cannon persevered until rescuers were deployed. After two days, The USS Gato submarine surfaced, and Mr. Can-non heard an American voice: ‘‘Is anyone there?’’ He ran across the submarine to the hatch where they pulled him to safety. Moreover, Mr. Cannon and ten other individ-uals from separate missions were rescued by the USS Gato where they lived for a month- long trek to Saipan. He returned to United States soil on or around July 4, 1945 to his wife, Murrie, and four-month-old daughter, Julie, whom he had yet to meet. Nearly 72 years later, Mr. Cannon was con-tacted by the son of the engineer behind Salvo Sally, Fred McDonald, as well as Don Langford, who were researching the bomber’s story. During their research; Mr. McDonald and Mr. Langford contacted officials in Japan who forwarded their inquiry and sent reporters to St. Louis to Mr. Cannon’s home to interview him. As a result, Japan invited Mr. Cannon to Myazaki, Japan in May of 2018 for a cere-mony honoring the crew of Salvo Sally. Mr. Cannon, his current wife, Imelda, Don Langford, Fred McDonald, and Judy Linquist attended the ceremony. There, Mr. Cannon was honored for his service and peacemaking efforts by officials in Japan. Not only was his experience honored, it was portrayed and pre-served in a documentary that Japan made about Salvo Sally and the only survivor, Mr. Jack Cannon. It is a privilege to stand today and honor Mr. Jack Cannon’s bravery and service to the country. Mr. Speaker, please join me in thank-ing and honoring Mr. Jack Cannon.

CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF WILLIE M
CCOVEY 
HON. NANCY PELOSI 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 9, 2018 Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the extraordinary life and legacy of a beloved icon, Willie McCovey, who passed away on October 31 in the Bay Area. Willie McCovey was an indelible part of the fabric of the San Francisco Giants and the city of Saint Francis. For more than six decades, he gave his heart, soul, and full spirit to the Giants, as a player, a mentor for younger players, and a leader in the clubhouse. His fa-miliar presence at Candlestick Park and then at AT&T Park even decades after his retire-ment provided a constant source of hope, strength, and inspiration for fans of all ages. Willie made history as one of just a handful of players in the history of the sport to secure a Rookie of the Year Award, a league MVP, and multiple All-Star Game MVP Awards. He retired in 1980 with the most home runs hit by a left-handed hitter, a record that stood for more than thirty years. During his career, Willie led the league in home runs three times and in RBIs twice. He retired with 18 grand slams, second only to Lou Gehrig, and with 521 home runs and 1,555 RBIs hit. His style of play forever changed the game, forcing de-fenses to respond to his intimidating power and strength. Willie lived the American Dream, from his rise from humble beginnings in the segregated South to his induction to Major League Base-ball’s Hall of Fame. The son of a railroad worker and one of ten children, Willie began working at age 12 to support his family, even-tually dropping out of high school to work full time. By age 17, his extraordinary talent and potential had become legendary, and he signed his first professional contract, begin-ning what would be an outstanding, record- shattering career. Yet, throughout Willie’s time on the field, it was not only his ferocious power hitting that set him apart, but also his incredible gen-erosity, joy, and love for the game. After his retirement, Willie continued to give back to his city and his team, and his kindness and gra-ciousness earned the devotion of generations of San Franciscans. That the San Francisco Giants’ annual most inspirational player award is named for Willie McCovey is a lasting testa-ment to his contributions on and off the field. Willie once said, ‘‘I’d like to think that when people think of San Francisco, they also think of Willie McCovey.’’ What a blessing it is to have forged such a legacy. He will be missed by players, fans, and San Franciscans of all backgrounds for generations to come, and his memory will be cherished every time the Gi-ants drive a home run into McCovey Cove. May it bring some measure of comfort to Willie’s cherished wife Estela, his daughter Al-lison, his grandchildren Raven, Philip, and Marissa, his sister Frances, brothers Clauzell and Cleon, Estela’s daughters Christel Marise and Christel Faye, and all who were fortunate enough to know and love Willie, that so many grieve with them and pray for them during this sad time. HONORING THE 2018 AGRI-CULTURIST OF THE YEAR GARY SERRATO HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 9, 2018 Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today alongside my colleagues, David Valadao, to commemorate Mr. Gary Serrato as the Fresno Chamber of Commerce’s 2018 Agriculturist of the Year. For over 30 years, Gary has de-voted himself to the Fresno agricultural com-munity by serving as an advocate and leader in his position as General Manager of the Fresno Irrigation District. A third-generation farmer, Gary gained ap-preciation for agricultural work at an early age. He worked on his father’s ranch near Fowler, California and eventually received a Bachelor of Science in Agricultural Business from Cali-fornia State University, Fresno in 1978. Gary joined the Fresno Irrigation District in 1986, where he held the positions of Watermaster and Assistant Manager of Oper-ations. As a result of Gary’s hard work and significant contributions, he was appointed the General Manager of the Fresno Irrigation Dis-trict in 2000. As General Manager, Gary has skillfully navigated the district through some of the most trying times for California Agriculture. He is considered a leading advocate for Fresno County farmers and has effectively commu-nicated numerous water issues to the public. Gary is a fervent believer in ensuring all Cen-tral Valley communities are provided with clean and accessible water. Gary has also demonstrated a strong com-mitment to community service throughout his career. Gary is involved with the Fresno Coun-ty Water Advisory Committee, Kings River Water Association and Upper Kings River Water Forum. He served on the board of the Community Food Bank for two terms and was elected to two terms as council member in the City of Fowler. Gary was also appointed by Governor Jerry Brown to the California Part-nership for the San Joaquin Valley and was appointed as the executive officer of North Kings Groundwater Sustainability Agency. Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues in the U.S. House of Representatives join me, Mr. V
ALADAO , and Mr. N UNES today in recognizing the career achievements of Mr. Gary Serrato. It is both fitting and appropriate that he is named the 2018 Agriculturist of the Year, as he retires from his position as General Man-ager of the Fresno Irrigation District at the end of this year. Gary has left his mark on the community and we are all grateful for his vi-sion and leadership. I ask that you join me in wishing Gary and his family continued success and prosperity.
