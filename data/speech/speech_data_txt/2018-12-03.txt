INFORMING CONGRESS OF THE DEATH OF GEORGE HERBERT WALKER BUSH, THE 41ST PRESI-DENT OF THE UNITED STATES— MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES The SPEAKER laid before the House the following message from the Presi-dent of the United States; which was read: To the Congress of the United States: By this Message, I officially inform you of the death of George Herbert Walker Bush, the forty-first President of the United States. President George H.W. Bush led a life that exemplified what is truly great about America. As with so many of his generation, the Greatest Generation, President Bush worked selflessly throughout his long life to bring about a world of justice and lasting peace. With his passing, we mark one of the last pages of a defining chapter in American history. Much of George H.W. Bush’s life was shaped by global conflict. He began his adult life by volunteering for combat in the Pacific Theater of World War Two. Through his heroic efforts as an aviator in the United States Navy, the youngest in United States history at the time, President Bush flew 58 com-bat missions, helping to win a hard- fought but fragile peace. Shortly after the war, the Nation found itself con-fronted with new challenges, including a protracted Cold War and the threat of nuclear annihilation by the Soviet Union. Propelled by his sense of duty to his Nation, George H.W. Bush re-en-tered public service, first as a Member

of Congress, and then as Ambassador to the United Nations, Chief of the United States Liaison Office in China, Direc-tor of Central Intelligence, Vice Presi-dent, and President of the United States. Resolute through war, President Bush was magnanimous in peace. As the Communist threat subsided, he stood down America’s nuclear bombers from the alert posture they had main-tained for so long and gently encour-aged the development of democracy and free markets in the crumbling So-viet Union. Through these and other gestures of goodwill, President Bush helped to bring the Cold War to a vic-torious end and to transition the coun-try into a period of sustained peace and prosperity. During one of his many combat mis-sions as a young man, then-Lieutenant Bush was forced to parachute from his airplane into the ocean below. Many years later, in celebration of a life of accomplishments in both war and peace, President Bush jumped from an-other aircraft—this time a helicopter— and parachuted safely onto the grounds of his home in Maine. Fearless, coura-geous, adventurous, and unyielding, through the highs and lows of the twentieth century and into the next millennium, President Bush served his Nation, creating an example that will inspire generations for decades to come.

REMEMBERING GEORGE H. W. BUSH Mr. M
CCONNELL. On Friday, the 94- year journey of George Herbert Walker Bush came to a close. At once, Ameri-cans from all walks of life began pay-ing tribute to this great patriot and giving thanks for his fearless heroism in wartime skies; for his dedicated, ex-pert service at the highest levels of government, in one essential role after another; for his loving fatherhood of a great family. I am not the first to observe that George Bush seemed like the ‘‘greatest generation’’ distilled into a single life

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES7252 December 3, 2018 
story—the immense contributions in both wartime and peacetime, the stun-ning bravery paired with quiet humil-ity, the belief that devoted service is not cause for special praise but simply each citizen’s duty. The ‘‘greatest generation’’ achieved all-American accomplishments and ex-hibited all-American virtues. And it may be just that no one did that as fully as our 41st President. Even in the ranks of this remarkable generation, he will stand out forever as one of its most especially remarkable sons. George Bush was the best of the best. Months after Pearl Harbor, our fu-ture President celebrated his 18th birthday and high school graduation by enlisting in the Navy. He was still a teenager when he got his wings—the youngest naval aviator. He was only 20 on that fateful day in September 1944. He was piloting one of four Avenger bombers aiming to take out a Japanese radio tower. His plane was hit. The engine caught fire, and the cockpit began filling with smoke, but George Bush kept his steady hands on the controls. Rather than turn tail, he and his crew went right on with their mission. Only after he had re-leased the bombs—and successfully damaged his target—did he finally bail out over the Pacific. With a steady hand on the controls, more worried about doing his duty for others than about himself, George Bush stayed the course. According to one biographer, that was a key phrase for him. It concluded a list of core principles he once laid out in a letter to his mother. Here is what he said: 
Tell the truth. Don’t blame people. Be strong. Do your best. Try hard. Forgive. Stay the course. 
Year after year, post after post, George Bush stayed the course, and he helped his country do the same. Through the fog of war in the Persian Gulf, when international order needed defending, America’s Commander-in- Chief led just as steadily as he had in that smoking cockpit almost 50 years earlier. And in between the Pacific and the Presidency, he steered us straight through countless challenges as a Con-gressman, Ambassador to the United Nations, Envoy to China, CIA Director, and Vice President. Serving capably in just one or two of these posts would ensure any citizen’s place in American history, but George Bush served in all of them and always with excellence. On the homefront, President Bush was a warrior for hope, optimism, and opportunity. As Presi-dent, he paved the way for education reform and signed legislation to give disabled Americans a better shot. Over-seas, he was a talented diplomat and powerful champion of our interests. It was on his watch that the Cold War finally ended. The free people of Europe threw off the shackles of com-munism. But President Bush knew America should not kick up our heels and enjoy a holiday from history. We fought and won the gulf war in order to make something perfectly clear to al-lies and enemies alike: It had to be right, and not might, that filled the void. We needed, he said, ‘‘a world where the rule of law supplants the rule of the jungle.’’ And his leadership moved us towards such a world. Through global change, domestic tur-moil, and economic transformation— whether in jobs that he had passion-ately sought out or in other assign-ments he dutifully accepted—George Bush kept us on course. He wasn’t a dramatic or revolutionary leader. He didn’t advertise radical change. He never quite seemed at home in the spotlight. Instead, he offered humility and a servant’s heart. He aspired to govern his country well, preserve what was good, and improve things where possible. He wanted to keep us flying high and challenge us to fly a little higher. He led us as he seemingly did everything in his life—with grace and kindness that seemed almost unbeliev-able, given all that he had accom-plished. Daring aviator. Chief spy. Wartime President. You would think this must be a tough and gruff guy, but it is the man’s good cheer and generous spirit that stand out most of all in our na-tional memory. He was a prolific hand- writer of notes and letters. He freely changed his own plans to make life easier for his staff or for the Secret Service detail. I saw recently that, some years after his Presidency, he couldn’t even bring himself to simply turn down a reporter’s request for an interview without crafting a warm, apologetic, full-page letter explaining his rationale. His decency and attentiveness to oth-ers was a credit to his upbringing. But it wasn’t only habit; it was principle. This is a man who said this in his inau-gural address: 
In our hearts, we know what matters. We cannot hope only to leave our children a big-ger car, a bigger bank account. We must hope to give them a sense of what it means to be a loyal friend; a loving parent; a citizen who leaves his home, his neighborhood, and town better than he found it. 
Looking beyond the day’s drama. Issuing a deep moral challenge. George Bush set the bar high. His country lis-tened because we saw him meet those standards himself. George Bush’s gifts were many, but some gifts were greater than others. George Bush and Barbara Pierce met at a Christmas party in 1941. He described her to his mother as ‘‘the niftiest girl at the dance.’’ Weeks after he returned from the war, they were married. ‘‘I have climbed perhaps the highest mountain in the world,’’ he would write much later, ‘‘but even that can-not hold a candle to being Barbara’s husband.’’ Their love story would grow to in-clude six children. It would span great joys and tragic loss. It weathered the challenges of the spotlight. In every chapter, George Bush served as com-forter and counselor. He cared for loved ones with a dedication that never ceased to amaze them. So much for the myth of the starched Episcopalian New Englander. George Bush was no stoic. In fact, he developed his own teary-eyed reputation as a founding member of what the Bush family calls ‘‘The Bawl Brigade.’’ That is b-a-w-l. He was considerate, empathetic, and kind, and the Bushes passed on these values to their children. They nurtured a family of leaders whose contributions have enriched this country even more. Few men so powerful would have even thought to call for a kinder, gentler nation. Even fewer could have lived it themselves. His words literally lifted our spirits. His example inspired us. A quarter of a century after George Bush left the Oval Office, his legacy continues to directly inspire not just ‘‘a thousand points of light’’ but millions of volunteers who serve others. So in war and peace, in public and in private, in high office and in family moments, George Bush stayed the course—the ‘‘greatest generation,’’ in-deed. The grand heroism that saved our Nation, the quiet diligence that built it up, and the basic goodness that sus-tains it—all in one. Today, the U.S. Senate joins the Na-tion and the Bush family in mourning and in prayer. We are also joined in gratitude. We are thankful that God gave this country George Bush and Barbara, thankful that they built such a loving family, and thankful that they may now be reunited—their great love story perfected in the light of His grace. f 
AMY, VICKY, AND ANDY CHILD PORNOGRAPHY VICTIM ASSIST-ANCE ACT OF 2018 Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I am pleased Congress recently passed my bipartisan bill, the Amy, Vicky, and Andy Child Pornography Victim As-sistance Act of 2018. This legislation will help provide meaningful assistance for child pornography victims to sup-port their recovery and allow them to reclaim their lives. This is a momen-tous day and many years in the mak-ing. I have introduced similar versions of this bill in the last three Congresses, and I look forward to the President signing it into law. Nearly 25 years ago, Congress en-acted the Violence Against Women Act, which created a process for vic-tims to seek restitution from defend-ants. For crimes that involve indi-vidual defendants who cause specific harm to particular victims, the restitu-tion statute works in a straightforward way. Child pornography is unlike any other crime. The abuse involved in cre-ating these images profoundly alters the lives of victims, while trafficking in the permanent record of that abuse

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S7253 December 3, 2018 
perpetuates and expands the harm. As the Supreme Court noted in its 2014 opinion in Paroline v. United States: ‘‘Every viewing of child pornography is a repetition of the victim’s abuse.’’ Un-fortunately, the internet has radically changed the nature of child pornog-raphy trafficking by drastically in-creasing the number of individuals who harm victims while simultaneously making it more difficult to identify the individuals from whom victims can seek restitution. In its decision in Paroline, the Su-preme Court made clear that the cur-rent restitution statute cannot provide meaningful compensation for most child pornography victims. The Amy, Vicky, and Andy Act changes that. The Amy, Vicky, and Andy Act es-tablishes more relevant and useful standards for child pornography vic-tims who seek restitution from defend-ants, including improved criteria for judges to use when calculating victims’ losses and provisions that ensure vic-tims will receive meaningful restitu-tion. Under this legislation, a victim of trafficking in child pornography may choose to seek restitution from defend-ants or to receive a one-time payment from the Child Pornography Victims Reserve within the federal Crime Vic-tims Fund. The reserve will be sup-ported by an assessment on all child pornography defendants. Congress understands the concern of the Supreme Court in Paroline that it is difficult to identify a discrete, read-ily definable incremental loss any one defendant caused any one victim, and so we have determined, after consid-ering a range of options with the spe-cific goal of fully compensating vic-tims of child pornography in a swift and just manner, that it is reasonable, fair, and equitable to fix the minimum restitution amount for trafficking in child pornography at $3,000. Congress firmly believes that the amounts in the act are consistent with the principle in Hughey v. United States, 495 U.S. 411 (1990), that restitu-tion should reflect the consequences of the defendant’s own conduct. Congress finds that $3,000 is the minimum res-titution that each individual defendant of trafficking in child pornography crimes should be assessed that com-ports with a defendant’s relative role in the causal process that underlies a victim’s general losses. This is fully in accordance with the Supreme Court’s decision in Paroline. This amount also upholds Congress’s longstanding goal of proportionality in sentencing be-cause it reflects the amount of restitu-tion currently being sought and or-dered in district courts throughout the country. Criminals convicted of child pornog-raphy crimes—be they crimes of pro-duction, distribution, or possession— are part of a group of wrongdoers who collectively cause harm. Indeed, the profound suffering of victims of child pornography crimes is due in part to their knowledge that, each day, untold numbers of people across the country and around the world are viewing and distributing images of the victims’ sex-ual abuse. Criminals who commit child pornography crimes cannot escape their responsibility to pay restitution by hiding in a crowd. Another important provision in the bill gives victims access to the images depicting them, which can be impor-tant for victim identification, expert testimony, forensic review, and treat-ment. The Amy, Vicky, and Andy Act has been endorsed by the National Organi-zation for Victim Assistance, National Association of Attorneys General, Na-tional Crime Victims Law Institute, National District Attorneys Associa-tion, National Center for Victims of Crime, National Association of VOCA Assistance Administrators, National Crime Victims Bar Association, CHILD USA, RAINN, APSAC in partnership with The New York Foundling, Enough is Enough, Thorn, Academy on Vio-lence and Abuse, DV LEAP, Utah Crime Victims Legal Clinic, Utah Coa-lition against Sexual Assault, and the Children’s Justice Fund. I appreciate all of their support. Developing and passing this impor-tant legislation has truly been a col-laborative and years-long effort. There are a number of people I would like to thank who have been vital in this proc-ess. First and foremost, I wish to recog-nize and thank Amy, Vicky, and Andy, the brave individuals for whom this bill is named. As victims in some of the most widely distributed child pornog-raphy series in the world, they rep-resent so many child pornography vic-tims. Amy, Vicky, and Andy strongly support this bill. Second, I want to thank Amy’s law-yer, James Marsh; Vicky’s lawyer, Carol Hepburn; Andy’s advocates at the Utah Crime Victims Legal Clinic; and Professor Paul Cassell at the Univer-sity of Utah, who took Amy’s case all the way to the Supreme Court. Their assistance with this bill, drawn from their tireless advocacy for victims, has been truly invaluable and much appre-ciated. Likewise, I must thank the dedicated attorneys at the Department of Justice for their important contribu-tions to this legislation. I would par-ticularly like to thank Alexandra Gelber of the Department of Justice Child Exploitation and Obscenity Sec-tion. Third, I wish to thank the Senators on both sides of the aisle who sup-ported this important legislation, espe-cially the 26 colleagues who co-spon-sored this legislation with me. In par-ticular, I wish to thank Ranking Mem-ber F
EINSTEIN , who joined me in intro-ducing this bill. We have served to-gether for many years, and she has long been a champion for crime vic-tims. I likewise want to express my gratitude to Chairman C
HUCK GRASS -
LEY, who also joined me in introducing the bill and who was crucial to getting this important legislation across the finish line. Throughout our Senate service, I have worked with Chairman GRASSLEY and Ranking Member F EIN-
STEIN on several bills to protect chil-dren, and I thank them for their com-mitment to ensuring that child victims have the support they need. I must thank members of their staff as well for their outstanding work: Senator F
EINSTEIN ’s counsel, Nicholas Xenakis, her former chief counsel for crime, Peter Hyun, and her former detailee, Sunjeet Randhawa; and Senator G
RASSLEY ’s chief Constitution counsel and crime counsel, Aaron Cummings, and his chief counsel for justice pro-grams, juvenile justice, and violence against women, Evelyn Fortier. Fourth, I wish to recognize some col-leagues in the House of Representa-tives. I would like to thank Congress-man T
REYGOWDY , the House sponsor of the bill. He has been a tireless advocate for child pornography victims, and I appreciate his dedicated service. Anna Bartlett in his office was a terrific help. Congressman M
ATTCARTWRIGHT , who represents Amy in the House, has been a champion on this issue and has introduced similar legislation in the last three Congresses. I would also like to recognize House Judiciary Committee Chairman B
OB G
OODLATTE . I have been fortunate to work with him on several initiatives throughout the years that were en-acted into law, most recently the Orrin G. Hatch-Bob Goodlatte Music Mod-ernization Act. I was pleased to col-laborate with him again on the Amy, Vicky, and Andy Act. I would like to thank his chief of staff, Shelley Hus-band, and his deputy chief of staff and chief counsel, Branden Ritchie, for their excellent job in shepherding this bill through the House. I also need to thank staff on the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations for their great work, chief counsel Robert Parmiter and former counsel Chris Grieco. I would like to give a special shout-out to Crime Subcommittee counsel Mar-garet Barr, who was an outstanding partner in this effort. They all deserve tremendous credit for this victory. I would be remiss if I did not thank staff in the cloakroom and Senate leg-islative counsel for their assistance. Our work in the Senate would not be possible without their dedicated serv-ice. Lastly, I would like to thank those on my staff who assisted me with this bill. Firstly, I would like to thank my former chief counsel and senior nomi-nations counsel, Thomas Jipping, who spearheaded this effort while he was a member of my staff. Next, I need to recognize Matt Sandgren, my chief of staff. His tenacity and expertise was invaluable in getting this legislation passed. I am also grateful to my legis-lative director, Matt Jensen, for his dedicated work on this bill through each step of the legislative process. Fi-nally, I would like to thank Kristin

McLintock, my senior legislative aide, who worked diligently with House staff and stakeholders over the last several months to refine this bill and get it across the finish line. They all deserve immense credit for their work to get this bill enacted into law. Child pornography is a truly evil crime that has lasting impacts on its victims. The Amy, Vicky, and Andy Child Pornography Victim Assistance Act will help provide victims the as-sistance they need to put their lives back together. I am honored and ex-tremely pleased this legislation will soon be signed into law.

WORLD AIDS DAY Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, today I wish to recognize the 30th anni-versary of World AIDS Day, which was this Saturday, December 1. This year, we can celebrate 30 years of progress made to fight HIV/AIDS globally and double down on our commitment to creating an AIDS-free generation. Last week, Congress passed another bipartisan reauthorization of the Presi-dent’s Plan for Emergency AIDS Relief PEPFAR. Since launching in 2003, PEPFAR has had a transformational impact on HIV/AIDS by catalyzing an incredible global response that has saved and transformed the lives of those living with HIV. Through PEPFAR, the United States has pro-vided over 14 million people with life-saving antiretroviral treatment in more than 50 countries. Two years ago, I had the privilege of meeting a 30– year-old man in Namibia named Simon who said thanked the American people for supporting the lifesaving treatment and care that he received through PEPFAR and the Global Fund. Indi-vidual stories of patients, like Simon, speak to the incredible impact of our collective efforts. They underscore the importance of maintaining support for the programs, including PEPFAR, the Global Fund, and UNAIDS, that made this success to date possible. When PEPFAR began in 2003, only 50,000 children were on lifesaving treat-ment in Africa; now, over 700,000 chil-dren are supported by antiretroviral treatment. PEPFAR has enabled over 2.4 million babies of HIV-infected mothers to be born HIV-free. It has provided critical care and support for more than 6.8 million orphans, vulner-able children, and their caregivers to mitigate the physical, emotional, and economic impact of HIV/AIDS. These are only a few of the many ways we have progressed in combatting HIV/ AIDS. Integral to reducing the number of new HIV cases and the viral loads of those living with HIV is testing. The theme of this year’s World AIDS Day is ‘‘know your status.’’ HIV testing al-lows people to make informed decisions about their future, including options for treatment and prevention. Accord-ing to data from UNAIDS, in 2017, 36.9 million people were living with HIV. Of those 36.9 million, 75 percent were aware of their HIV status. These num-bers have steadily increased over the years, and we must continue our work to expand access to, and remove the stigmas associated with, HIV testing. While there is much to celebrate, there is still a tremendous amount of work to be done. PEPFAR reports that only 52 percent of children ages 0 to 14 with HIV have access to lifesaving treatment, compared to 59 percent of adults with HIV. In 2017, 180,000 chil-dren were newly infected with HIV. That is 180,000 too many. Threats to the continued progress of critically important programs have come from our own leadership in the White House, which continues annually to propose enormous funding cuts for both PEPFAR and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. We must continue to press the Trump administration to recognize the colos-sal harm of restricting funding to these programs, including the lifesaving treatment and evidence-based preven-tion interventions they provide to men, women, and children, and the greater impact on achieving epidemic control. I call on the Trump administration to reverse its reinstatement and expan-sion of the Mexico City policy, often referred to as the ‘‘global gag rule,’’ which impedes the ability of organiza-tions to provide lifesaving prevention, detection, and treatment services. These investments must be not only continued, but increased, as we can see an AIDS-free generation on the hori-zon. While we celebrate the progress that we have made on the 30th anniversary of Global AIDS Day, we must recommit ourselves to combat HIV/AIDS both at home and abroad, beginning with test-ing. With the commitment of partner countries, reinforced by the support of donor nations, civil society, people liv-ing with HIV, faith-based organiza-tions, scientific research community and academia like Johns Hopkins Uni-versity and the University of Mary-land, the private sector, foundations, and implementing organizations like Catholic Relief Services and Lutheran World Relief, success in the fight against HIV/AIDS is within our grasp.

TRIBUTE TO MAJOR GENERAL BRIAN E. WINSKI Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, on behalf of myself and Mr. R
EED, as the Chair and Ranking Member of the Sen-ate Armed Services Committee, and the cochairs of the Senate Army Cau-cus, it is our honor to pay tribute to a great leader and an exceptional officer of the U.S. Army, MG Brian E. Winski, the chief of legislative liaison for the Office of the Secretary of the Army, as he prepares to leave this position for a new post in the Army of even greater importance to our Nation. Major Gen-eral Winski provides outstanding lead-ership, advice, and sound professional judgment on numerous critical issues of enduring importance to the Army, Congress, and this Nation. Major General Winski has served our Army and our Nation for more than 30 years. A native of Wisconsin, Major General Winski was commissioned in 1988 as an infantry officer from the University of Wisconsin. He has been a true professional, dedicated soldier, leader, and officer. Throughout his ca-reer, he has commanded our great sol-diers at many levels and deployed to combat numerous times in defense of the nation. He has served in various command and staff positions over multiple com-bat tours to Kuwait, Iraq, and Afghani-stan. He was a rifle platoon leader in Desert Shield/Storm, infantry bat-talion executive officer during the in-vasion of Iraq in 2003, chief of oper-ations for the 101st Airborne Division in Iraq, reconnaissance squadron com-mander in Iraq, Division Operations Of-ficer for the 101st Airborne Division in Afghanistan, and brigade combat team commander in Iraq. Major General Winski has extensive joint and interagency experiences. He has served as the operations director CJ–3 for Regional Command East in Af-ghanistan, G–3 Chief of Operations for Multi-National Division North in Iraq, and as a military professor in the lead-ership department at the Naval War College. His other assignments included serv-ice in the 82nd Airborne Division, the 101st Airborne Division AASLT, the 3rd Infantry Division, the 1st Cavalry Divi-sion, the Joint Readiness Training Cen-ter, the Naval War College, and the Army Legislative Liaison office. Major General Winski recently served as the Director of Army Operations, Readi-ness, and Mobilization, HQDA G–3/5/7. For the past 18 months, Major Gen-eral Winski has implemented and en-hanced strategic partnerships with Congress. Through his leadership, the Army significantly advanced relation-ships with both legislative chambers and improved and broadened congres-sional support for Army priorities. Major General Winski managed com-plex issues through multiple legislative cycles, enabling the Army to receive the necessary resources to improve readiness, accelerate modernization, and reform processes to support com-bat operations, sustain the all-volun-teer force, and improve the quality of life for soldiers, Army civilians, and their families. On behalf of Congress and the United States of America, we thank Major General Winski, his wife Kim, and their entire family for their continued com-mitment, sacrifice, and contributions to this great Nation. We join our col-leagues in wishing him future successes as he continues to serve our great Army and Nation.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT COMMANDER KERRY S. JACKSON ∑Mrs. HYDE-SMITH. Madam Presi-dent, I would like to call attention to U.S. Navy LCDR Kerry S. Jackson, who is retiring December 7, 2018, after 26 years of honorable service to our country. He enlisted in 1988, completed Navy SEAL Training in 1989, and re-ceived his commission as a naval offi-cer in 2003. As a SEAL, he completed eight deployments and a broad scope of high-risk missions across the globe. From 2015 to 2018, Lieutenant Com-mander Jackson served as executive of-ficer of the Naval Small Craft Instruc-tional and Applied Technical Training School, NAVSCIATTS, located at Sten-nis Space Center in Hancock County, MS. NAVSCIATTS trains students from partner nations around the world in small craft and riverine operations. Under his leadership, foreign military students are better prepared to fight both state and nonstate adversaries by employing advanced riverine combat, navigation, and other technical skills developed at NAVSCIATTS. Lieuten-ant Commander Jackson’s leadership of this program created and fostered critical diplomatic relationships with partner nations around the world. During the course of his military ca-reer, he has been awarded three Joint Service Commendation Medals, seven Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medals, one Army Commendation Medal, two Joint Service Achievement Medals, five Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medals, the Combat Ac-tion Ribbon, and various other per-sonal, unit, and campaign awards. I commend Lieutenant Commander Jackson for his 26 years of faithful service to our Nation, extend my deep-est gratitude to him and his entire family, and wish him the best during his transition to civilian life. ∑

PRESIDENTIAL MESSAGE 
A MESSAGE FROM THE PRESI-DENT OF THE UNITED STATES OFFICIALLY NOTIFYING THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES OF THE DEATH OF FORMER PRESIDENT GEORGE HERBERT WALKER BUSH—PM 49 The PRESIDING OFFICER laid be-fore the Senate the following message from the President of the United States which was ordered to lie on the table: To the Congress of the United States: By this Message, I officially inform you of the death of George Herbert Walker Bush, the forty-first President of the United States. President George H.W. Bush led a life that exemplified what is truly great about America. As with so many of his generation, the Greatest Generation, President Bush worked selflessly throughout his long life to bring about a world of justice and lasting peace. With his passing, we mark one of the last pages of a defining chapter in American history. Much of George H.W. Bush’s life was shaped by global conflict. He began his adult life by volunteering for combat in the Pacific Theater of World War Two. Through his heroic efforts as an aviator in the United States Navy, the youngest in United States history at the time, President Bush flew 58 com-bat missions, helping to win a hard- fought but fragile peace. Shortly after the war, the Nation found itself con-fronted with new challenges, including a protracted Cold War and the threat of nuclear annihilation by the Soviet Union. Propelled by his sense of duty to his Nation, George H.W. Bush re-en-tered public service, first as a Member of Congress, and then as Ambassador to the United Nations, Chief of the United States Liaison Office in China, Direc-tor of Central Intelligence, Vice Presi-dent, and President of the United States. Resolute through war, President Bush was magnanimous in peace. As the Communist threat subsided, he stood down America’s nuclear bombers from the alert posture they had main-tained for so long and gently encour-aged the development of democracy and free markets in the crumbling So-viet Union. Through these and other gestures of goodwill, President Bush helped to bring the Cold War to a vic-torious end and to transition the coun-try into a period of sustained peace and prosperity. During one of his many combat mis-sions as a young man, then-Lieutenant Bush was forced to parachute from his airplane into the ocean below. Many years later, in celebration of a life of accomplishments in both war and peace, President Bush jumped from an-other aircraft—this time a helicopter— and parachuted safely onto the grounds of his home in Maine. Fearless, coura-geous, adventurous, and unyielding, through the highs and lows of the twentieth century and into the next millennium, President Bush served his Nation, creating an example that will inspire generations for decades to come.

REMEMBERING GEORGE H. W. BUSH Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, in a short time we will gather before pro-ceeding to the rotunda to honor the life of George Herbert Walker Bush, the 41st President of the United States. George H. W. Bush will be greatly missed in many ways. He was undeni-ably dedicated to his country, from his time as a young Navy pilot through his long career in public service, in both elective and appointed offices, as our Ambassador to the United Nations, our Envoy to China, and Director of the CIA. In a life that spanned 10 decades, 7 decades of George H. W. Bush’s life was spent in faithful and humble serv-ice to his country. Though our careers intersected only briefly, I knew him to be a fine man, a decent man. Even when he opposed your views, you knew he was doing what he thought was best for the United States of America. He embodied the characteristics we admire in a President: integrity, civil-ity, dignity, humility, and a sincere in-terest in bipartisanship. He valued pub-lic service and had respect for govern-ment as a noble force—a force for good. When he wanted to say something to someone, he would sit down to write them a handwritten and usually heart-felt note. He used the word ‘‘friend’’ often, and when he said it, he meant it. His yearning for a kinder, gentler Na-tion seems more needed now than when he first called for it. Not all of his efforts will be cele-brated, and, of course, that is true of every politician who has reached high

office. But as we look back at his life and career, it is clear that George H. W. Bush cared deeply about more than just his country and its ideals. He cared deeply about its citizens, no mat-ter what their situation. His early in-volvement in the YMCA, his advocacy for the Americans with Disabilities Act, and his support for volunteerism and service throughout his career are a testament to that fact. He called on Americans to be ‘‘a thousand points of light,’’ and he was too modest to say that he and his wife Barbara were two of the brightest. Our hearts are with the Bush family today. REMEMBERING GILES PERKINS Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, my heart is also heavy today at an-other loss: Giles Perkins, who was one of the top lawyers in Birmingham, AL, and the former head of the Alabama Democratic Party. He died of cancer over the weekend. He was a close friend and mentor of one of our friends here in the Senate, Mr. D
OUG JONES , who called him the ‘‘Yoda’’ of his campaign. I talked to Giles frequently—in fact, just a few days ago—and he was always filled with a desire to do good, a desire that the right thing be done, and a de-sire to help his friends—D
OUGJONES at the top of the list. Giles was a booster of many things Alabama, and he will sorely be missed by his family, his dear friend, the jun-ior Senator from Alabama, the State he loved, and by me. I yield the floor. f

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, December 3, 2018 Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Sean Eastman. Sean and his fellow teammates cre-ated the winning app in Iowa’s Third District for the Congressional App Challenge 2018. Their team attends Waukee High School and Prairie View Middle School in Waukee, Iowa. The Congressional App Challenge encour-ages students to learn how to code through annual district-wide competitions hosted by Members of Congress for their district. The team’s app was entitled ‘‘FastLane.’’ It was designed to give students and parents infor-mation about their bus routes, bus delays, and assist with changing routes. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to recognize Sean for creating the winning app with his team. I am proud to represent him in the United States Congress. I ask that my col-leagues in the United States House of Rep-resentatives join me in congratulating Sean and wishing him nothing but continued suc-cess. HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF MRS. GLORIA BLANCHE TAY-LOR GORRELL HON. CEDRIC L. RICHMOND 
OF LOUISIANA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, December 3, 2018 Mr. RICHMOND. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the life and legacy of Mrs. Gloria Blanche Taylor Gorrell affectionately known as ‘‘Bo’’ or ‘‘Bo Peep.’’ Mrs. Gorrell passed away Saturday, November 24, 2018 at the age of 87. Mrs. Gorrell was born on September 10, 1931 to the late Blanche Taylor Williams and William Taylor in New Orleans, Louisiana. She was a devoted Christian, choir member and active in many ministries within the church. Mrs. Gorrell was educated in the Orleans Parish Public Schools. She attended Albert Wicker Elementary, Booker T. Washington High School and McDonough No. 35 High School. She was an active student. As a ma-jorette in high school she entertained many with her baton twirling and high stepping dance moves. After graduation she enrolled at Leland College near Baker, Louisiana. In 1995, Mrs. Gorrell retired from Charity Hospital and began a new chapter in her life. Retirement afforded her time to travel with family and friends. She immensely enjoyed her bus trips, Women’s Conferences and fam-ily vacations. She was an avid reader, but more content when talking to her friends, shar-ing thoughts and prayers. Mrs. Gorrell loved the city and the people of New Orleans. Her legacy will forever be a part of the city and her dedication to community embodies the spirit of New Orleans. We can-not match the sacrifices made by Mrs. Gorrell, but surely, we can try to match her sense of service. We cannot match her courage, but we can strive to match her devotion. Mrs. Gorrell’s survivors include her sons, Rudy Gorrell, Jr. and Kevin Gorrell; daughter Karen Gorrell Johnson; son in law, Harry E. Johnson, Sr.; beloved sister, Joyce Chambers and devoted brother in law Lawrence Cham-bers. Granddaughters: Jennifer Johnson, Damonica Gorrell, Brideisha Harness. Grandsons: Tyeast Robinson, Damien Gorrell, Sr., Harry Johnson, Jr. (Angela), Nicholas Johnson, Tyris Dauphin, Kevin Harness. Great-Granddaughters: Eriel Gorrell, Kennedi Parker, Kaelyn Dauphin. Great-Grandsons: Isaiah Gorrell, Damien Gorrell, Jr., Elijah Gorrell, Erin Gorrell, Johnathan Gorrell, Ian Gorrell, Chase Dauphin. Mr. Speaker, I celebrate the life and legacy of Mrs. Gloria Blanche Taylor Gorrell. HONORING KARRIE PARDIECK HON. LUKE MESSER

Karrie has helped thousands of individuals navigate the complex federal bureaucracy and receive the help they need, specifically relating to So-cial Security and Medicare benefits. Karrie has had a long career serving the people of Indi-ana’s 6th Congressional District, as she pre-viously worked for my predecessor and our current Vice President, M

CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF MARY STANLEY 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, December 3, 2018 Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life of Mrs. Mary Stanley who passed away on November 3, 2018 at the age of 91. Mary will be remembered as a fearless advocate for women in politics, always willing to share knowledge and build leaders in the Central Valley. Although she never held office herself, Mary worked tirelessly to ensure women everywhere had the opportunity to be elected to local and national office. Mary Stanley was born on October 7, 1927 in Grand Forks, North Dakota. She was raised by her mother Geraldine Reisler and the man she considered her father, Morris Reisler, in the Bronx, New York. Mary later moved with her mother to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where she began her first job as a waitress at 14 years old to help her family make ends meet. While waitressing, Mary met and married a young sailor in 1943 and had three children. In 1953, Mary married Jay Stanley. In 1961, the couple moved to Fresno, California to launch a frozen foods business together. Jay ran the sales and Mary managed the business operations for the company. Zero Foods achieved much success with Mary and Jay at the helm. The couple remained happily mar-ried for 47 years. At an early stage in her civic involvement, Mary recognized that women in the Central

Valley did not have the same opportunities as women in larger cities. This fueled her ambi-tion to advocate and campaign for electing women to office. In 1964, Mary joined the Re-publican Women’s Club where she became Fresno County’s co-chair in Ronald Reagan’s successful campaign for Governor of Cali-fornia. Mary’s advocacy earned her an ap-pointment to the California Commission on the Status of Women by Governor Reagan. Mary was the only member on the Commission from the Central Valley, and she made sure to rep-resent its unique interests and struggles. She was eventually elected treasurer and traveled across the state speaking to various women’s groups about her advocacy. Mary joined the National Women’s Political Caucus in 1971, where she worked in a bipar-tisan fashion to help run Democratic and Re-publican campaigns. Her dedication and com-mitment to electing women to office was suc-cessful. Mary campaigned for many elected officials, including Senator D
IANNE FEINSTEIN , Congresswomen J
ACKIE SPEIER and M AXINE  W
ATERS , and former Senators Barbara Boxer, Olympia Snowe, and Nancy Kassebaum. In the mid-1970s, Mary joined U.S. Rep-resentative Martha Griffiths in working for the enactment of the Equal Rights Amendment. Mary changed her party affiliation to Demo-cratic, standing strong with Representative Griffiths and countless others for the ratifica-tion of the Equal Rights Amendment. Since joining the Democratic Party, Mary became an active member of the Fresno County Demo-cratic Women’s Club, helping to increase the participation of women in politics. Mary was recognized for her work through-out her life. She was honored by Fresno’s Marjaree Mason Center for her lifetime achievements, awarded a Medal of Honor by the Veteran Feminists of America, and given the Courage to Run Award by the Jeannette Rankin Women’s Scholarship Fund. Mary was preceded in death by her hus-band Jay and children, Judy and Jerry Stan-ley. She leaves behind her grandson Jerry Stanley and his wife Debi Stanley, grand-daughter Stephanie Blankenship, and great- grandsons Justin, Wes, Aidan, Nigel, and Zane. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the life and achievements of Mary Stanley. Mary leaves behind a remarkable leg-acy of advocacy and selflessness, which helped change the lives of countless women looking to enter politics. She will be missed dearly by those who had the pleasure of knowing her.

RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE OF SUSAN ‘‘SUE’’ REYNOLDS 
HON. MARK DeSAULNIER 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, December 3, 2018 Mr. D
ESAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, in honor of Native American Heritage Month, I rise today to recognize Susan ‘‘Sue’’ Reynolds, a fine art and documentary photographer and long-time resident of Walnut Creek, for her work pro-moting Native American traditions and culture. Sue was born and raised in Northern Cali-fornia, and went on to earn an undergraduate degree in Art History at the University of Cali-fornia, Davis. While attending UC Davis, Sue worked with the Oakland Museum’s curator for prints and photography. Through her work with the museum, she was introduced to and in-spired by pioneering female documentary pho-tographers such as Dorothea Lange. In 2005, she began photographing Native American ceremonies at reservations through-out the western states, and went on to publish a book, Still Here: Not Living in Tipis. Sue’s book features many of her photographs of trib-al ceremonies that capture the traditions of Native American communities. Following the publication of her book, Sue established Ev-eryday Native, a collaborative teaching re-source that focuses on building bridges of un-derstanding between non-Native and Native American youth. Sue’s talent for creating visual narratives of the Native American culture has helped to raise awareness of the challenges and preju-dice faced by the community. This Native American Heritage Month, I commend Sue for her dedication and contributions to fostering a cultural sensitivity to Native Americans. f

Katie worked on our team for over a year in several capacities in our Washington, D.C. of-fice. She started as our staff assistant where she was responsible for helping with our con-stituent mail program, managing our internship program, and processing constituent tour re-quests. She has been promoted twice and served as a Legislative Assistant, where she is responsible for advising me on a variety of policy issues, including health care, energy, natural resources, judiciary issues, small busi-ness, science, space and technology. On a personal note, Katie is a positive spirit and kind soul with a big smile. Literally, every day, Katie made our office a better place to work, and she was a valuable member of our team.

COMMEMORATING THE ONE HUN-DREDTH ANNIVERSARY OF PO-LAND’S INDEPENDENCE 
HON. MARCY KAPTUR 
OF OHIO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, December 3, 2018 Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, earlier this month on November 11, 2018, the Polish peo-ple celebrated 100 years of regained inde-pendence for their nation. I am delighted to rise along with my fellow Congressional Po-land Caucus Co-chairs to introduce a bipar-tisan resolution to commemorate this historic event as well as the democratic values the United States and Poland have shared since the 1700s. As a proud Polish American, I join thou-sands of members in the Polish diaspora across our nation and in the world to acknowl-edge this very auspicious achievement. Indeed, the United States-Polish friendship precedes the birth of the United States, where Polish Generals Taddeus Kosciuszko and Casmir Pulaski bravely fought for independ-ence and freedoms for both the United States and Poland. In the late 1700s, Poland adopted its first constitution in Europe, inspired by ours, based on the ideas of liberty and constitutional mon-archy, which paved the way for future demo-cratic reforms. Tragically just four years later, Poland was invaded and succumbed to the third partition between the Russian Empire, the Kingdom of Prussia, and the Hapsburg Monarchy, and as a result lost its sovereignty for the next 123 years. Then in 1918, following World War I, with the support of President Woodrow Wilson, Po-land was restored to the map of Europe and resumed its persistent climb to freedom. He-roic Polish resistance fighters and soldiers fought in World War II against tyranny on all fronts and at home only to find that liberation from the Nazis became domination by the So-viet Union. Yet, Poland refused to surrender. Poland’s Solidarity movement, the largest European resistance movement, led to the ulti-mate defeat of communism and the fall of the Soviet Empire. In 1989, after 43 years of in-creasing resistance to occupation, Poland’s fierce love of liberty spilled over into a mas-sive electoral victory won by Solidarnosc. Poland’s accomplishments in the generation of freedom which followed are nothing short of remarkable. Today we celebrate Poland’s membership in the NATO Alliance and the Eu-ropean Union as a sign of its continued com-mitment to liberal democratic values, rule of law, human rights, and freedom of the press. Let this 100th anniversary year of Poland’s rebirth serve as an occasion to honor the

courage and sacrifice of the people of Poland, who never lost their determination to advance the cause of Polish independence. Let us come together to wish the Polish people one hundred years more of close friendship be-tween our nations and the democratic values that bind us.

RECOGNIZING MRS. EVELYN WALKER ROBINSON ON HER 100TH BIRTHDAY 
HON. PETER J. VISCLOSKY 
OF INDIANA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, December 3, 2018 Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I congratulate Mrs. Evelyn Walker Robinson on a momentous milestone, her 100th birthday, which was on December 2, 2018. Evelyn will be celebrating with family and friends on Saturday, December 8, 2018, at First Baptist Church in Gary, Indiana. Evelyn Walker Robinson was born on De-cember 2, 1918, in Montgomery, Alabama, to Homer and India Walker. When Evelyn was only fifteen months old, she and her family re-located to Gary. Shortly after, in 1920, her family joined First Baptist Church, where Eve-lyn has remained a devoted and faithful pa-rishioner ever since. She was married to her beloved husband, Wesley Ben (Bennie) Rob-inson, for many years until his passing in 1968. Evelyn worked most of her life, holding var-ious positions within state and local govern-ment agencies, including the Lake County De-partment of Public Welfare and what is now known as the Division of Family Resources. Mrs. Robinson also worked for twenty-eight years for the Lake County Economic Oppor-tunity Council, during which time she served as the director of the Emergency Food and Medical Services Program and the Nutrition Program for the Elderly.

Please join me in wishing Evelyn Walker Robinson a very happy 100th birthday. f 
TRIBUTE TO KRISTEN STONE 
HON. DAVID YOUNG 
OF IOWA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, December 3, 2018 Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Kristen Stone. Kristen and her fellow teammates cre-ated the winning app in Iowa’s Third District for the Congressional App Challenge 2018. Their team attends Waukee High School and Prairie View Middle School in Waukee, Iowa.

The team’s app was entitled ‘‘FastLane.’’ It was designed to give students and parents infor-mation about their bus routes, bus delays and assist with changing routes. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to recognize Kristen for creating the winning app with her team. I am proud to represent her in the United States Congress. I ask that my col-leagues in the United States House of Rep-resentatives join me in congratulating Kristen and wishing her nothing but continued suc-cess.

HONORING MAYOR RALPH RUBIO 
HON. JIMMY PANETTA 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, December 3, 2018 Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor the retiring Mayor of Seaside, California, Ralph Rubio, for his career in public service and his commitment to serving the people of the central coast of California. His leadership has improved the lives of many, and I am hon-ored to acknowledge this legacy today in the C
ONGRESSIONAL RECORD . Throughout his two decades in public office, Mayor Rubio has remained committed to growing the local economy and increasing ac-cess to city services for residents. During his time on the Seaside City Council, Mayor Rubio led initiatives that prioritized city devel-opment and diligent budgeting. As Mayor of Seaside, he supported the expansion of vital city services, including police and fire depart-ments, anti-gang and drug programs, and city beautification. Seaside students benefit daily from his work to support increased funding for public schools, allowing for necessary repairs, improving school safety, and retaining quality educators. Mr. Rubio’s record of serving his constituents certainly left a lasting impact on the City of Seaside and the Monterey Penin-sula. A lifelong resident of Seaside, Mr. Rubio has continuously demonstrated his commit-ment to civic engagement. He has dedicated his time to multiple boards and commissions, working diligently to improve transportation in-frastructure and decrease water pollution. He also served as Chair of the Fort Ord Reuse Authority, overseeing the development of the former military base to strengthen the local economy while also protecting the environ-ment. In addition to his professional efforts, Mr. Rubio is an active volunteer for many organi-zations. He has chaired the Seaside Special Olympics Committee, offering sports training and competitions for children and adults with intellectual disabilities, and is a proud member of the National Council of La Raza and Na-tional Association for the Advancement of Col-ored People. As Mr. Rubio celebrates his retirement, I am proud to commend him on his invaluable work as a public servant for the past two decades. On behalf of Central Coast residents, I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking Seaside Mayor Ralph Rubio for his public service and wishing him a long and healthy retirement.

CONGRATULATING TOM CONNAUGHTON ON HIS RETIRE-MENT FROM A DISTINGUISHED CAREER 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, December 3, 2018 Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Tom Connaughton, who is retiring from Cook Medical Group in Canton, Illinois. Mr. Connaughton served as Vice President of Government Affairs for Cook Medical Group for 15 years, and has had a stellar career in public service. Mr. Connaughton served as a staff member for Senator Birch Bayh for many years. He began working for Sen. Bayh in 1969, and in 1970, was called to active duty in Vietnam as a captain in military intelligence, where he was awarded a Bronze Star. He returned to Sen. Bayh’s staff in 1974, where he served as Counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee. He then served as Issues Director for Sen. Bayh’s reelection campaign in 1974 and presi-dential campaign in 1976. Mr. Connaughton moved to Sen. Bayh’s personal staff in 1978 taking on the position of Legislative Director, and later becoming an Administrative Director from 1979 to 1980. After leaving Sen. Bayh’s staff, Mr. Connaughton became a founding partner and managing partner of Bayh, Connaughton, and Stewart. From 2000 to 2003 Mr. Connaughton was the President of the American Association for Homecare, and from 2003 to 2018 he served as the Vice President of Government Affairs for Cook Group. I commend Mr. Connaughton on an outstanding career of public service and wish him the best as he begins to enjoy a well- earned retirement. It is because of dedicated leaders such as Mr. Tom Connaughton that I am especially proud to serve Illinois’ 17th District. Mr. Speaker, I would like to again formally con-gratulate Mr. Tom Connaughton for an excep-tional career and thank him for all of his con-tributions and service to the community of Canton.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, December 3, 2018 Mr. MESSER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recog-nize a longtime member of my staff, Amy Burke, for her work in my office and her serv-ice to our state. Amy has been on our team from the very beginning, working as our office manager and scheduler in my Washington, D.C. office. Amy is a rock star and has been making sure the trains run on time for years. She is an invalu-able part of our team and her service and hard work have been unparalleled. On a personal note, words cannot express the appreciation my family has for Amy’s ex-traordinary commitment to us over the past six years. We literally could not have made this journey without her. I want to thank Amy for her friendship and dedication to our work. I wish her and Sean continued success in all that God has planned for their family. f 
TRIBUTE TO LARRY COTTER 
HON. DON YOUNG 
OF ALASKA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, December 3, 2018 Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Speaker, upon the occasion of his retirement, I rise today to give special recognition to Lawrence P. ‘‘Larry’’ Cotter, a great friend and an out-standing, hardworking, and dedicated Alaskan. Larry has contributed tremendously to the positive evolution of our fisheries management in Alaska, the Pacific Northwest, and indeed the entire country. Larry has lived in Alaska and worked in the commerial fishing industry since 1974. He spent over four years as a seafood processing worker in Juneau, and eight years as a labor organizer and rep-resentative for seafood processing workers and longshoremen. Larry served on the Advi-sory Panel to the North Pacific Fishery Man-agement Council for six years and then as a voting member of the Council for an additional six years. The time of Larry’s service on the Council was during the transition years when foreign fishing was being phased out, our U.S. domestic fishing and processing capabilities were stepping up to replace the foreign fleets, and allocation issues among U.S. fisheries in-terests were first coming to the forefront. These were difficult, challenging, and exciting times—during which Larry was chair of several committees, including the Bycatch Committee and Crab Management Committee. Larry also served as chair of the Council’s Steller Sea Lion Mitigation Committee and Alaska Sea-food Marketing Institute’s Responsible Fish-eries Management Committee. Most recently, until late this year, Larry has served as founding CEO of the Community Development Quota (CDQ) Group, known as the Aleutian Pribilof Island Community Devel-opment Association, or ‘‘APICDA.’’ It is in this area of service to APICDA and his helping to develop, implement and sustain, not only APICDA, but the entire CDQ program, that Larry did perhaps his best work, accom-plishing goals that will have positive impacts on Western Alaskan Communities for genera-tions to come. Larry’s work on the formation of Alaska’s CDQ program has benefited all of the participating communities and his more than twenty-five years with APICDA has helped to develop the workforce, build infrastructure, and improve the economy throughout the Western Alaska Region. Larry’s longtime leadership in the seafood industry has helped to guide and shape the policies and programs that many enjoy today. Many observers, myself included, have cor-rectly noted that Alaska has the best managed fisheries in the country, perhaps in the world, and I know we could not have achieved that status without Larry’s tireless dedication and devotion to making our seafood industry sus-tainable for the long haul. Thank you Larry for your tremendous contributions to sustainable fisheries and to the participation of our coastal communities in those fisheries. Enjoy your re-tirement, and best of luck in your continuing endeavors. TRIBUTE TO ARYA KARNIK HON. DAVID YOUNG

Mr. Speaker, I rise to recog-nize a former member of my staff, Jenna Knepper, for her work in my office and her service to our state. Jenna worked in my Indiana office for nearly a year, serving as our political director. Jenna has an incredible work ethic and was a tre-mendous asset to our organization.

would also like to thank the West Georgia Board of Realtors for taking the time to honor the Fair Housing Act of 1968. Not only do they honor the Fair Housing Act today, they honor it every single day while they serve the citi-zens of Georgia. In the midst of a national mourning, The Fair Housing Act landed on President Lyndon B. Johnson’s desk just a week after Martin Lu-ther King Jr’s assassination. The Fair Housing Act allowed Americans to become home own-ers no matter their race, religion, sex, or na-tional origin. This had a large impact on the African American community, this allowed them to become first-time home owners. Thus, providing better care for themselves and fam-ily. This Act represents a big triumph for the people, to be heard and to promote the change of an unjust environment. There is still a lot of work to be done, but I am proud of what we have achieved. In 1988 Congress amended the Fair Housing Act to protect dis-abled citizens and familial status. We have come a long way, but our fight must continue. We must never forget the Fair Housing Act of 1968 and continue to be a champion for jus-tice and equality for all.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 16 DAYS OF ACTIVISM AGAINST GENDER- BASED VIOLENCE 
HON. LOIS FRANKEL 
OF FLORIDA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, December 3, 2018 Ms. FRANKEL of Florida. Mr. Speaker, today we recognize the 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence, a campaign to raise awareness and spur action to end vio-lence against women and girls. Over the past year, with the explosion of the #MeToo and Time’s Up movements, women around the world have come forward with their own harrowing stories of sexual violence—an abuse of power that often causes emotional and physical distress and harms their ability to care for their family. One in three women worldwide will experience gender-based vio-lence in their lifetimes, ranging from sexual vi-olence and human trafficking to harmful prac-tices like child marriage. The statistics are staggering—nearly 39,000 girls under 18 are married each day and over 200 million women and girls have been subjected to female gen-ital mutilation. Gender-based violence continues to hold women back from reaching their full potential. In 2012, the United States government re-leased the Strategy to Prevent and Respond to Gender-Based Violence Globally, marking ending violence against women and girls as top diplomatic and foreign assistance prior-ities. On the 16 Days of Activism against Gen-der-Based Violence, let’s reinforce our com-mitment to ensuring the safety of women and girls and recommit to women’s empowerment worldwide. Remember this: when women and girls suc-ceed, their nations succeed. HONORING JAKE VREEBURG HON. LUKE MESSER 
OF INDIANA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, December 3, 2018 Mr. MESSER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recog-nize a dedicated member of my staff, Jake Vreeburg, for his work in my office and his service to our state. Jake has been a part of our team for the past four years, first as our Legislative Director and then as the Staff Director for the House Republican Policy Committee. Jake writes, re-views, and edits the Legislative Digest, a daily summary of legislation considered by the House of Representatives and distributed to 2,500 staff and Members. As Legislative Di-rector, he led efforts to build support for pro-grams, bills, and events that advanced my leg-islative agenda. Jake has been a close con-fidant and trusted adviser throughout my time in Congress. On a personal note, Jake is a gifted leader who was far more than an advisor to me. He is my friend. I admire Jake’s integrity, persist-ence and loyalty. I wish Jake continued suc-cess in all that God has planned for him and his family. I have no doubt Jake’s biggest im-pact on our nation are yet to come. I look for-ward to cheering Jake on in those efforts.

INTRODUCTION OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ADVERTISING EQ-UITY ACCOUNTABILITY ACT 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, December 3, 2018 Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today, I intro-duce a bill, the Federal Government Adver-tising Equity Accountability Act, to require all federal agencies to include in their annual budget requests to Congress the amount they spend on advertising contracts with small dis-advantaged businesses (SDBs) and busi-nesses owned by minorities and women. Fed-eral agencies would be required to provide prior, current, and projected total expenditures for advertising contracts. In 2007, the Government Accountability Of-fice (GAO) examined spending on advertising contracts with minority-owned businesses by five agencies—the Department of Defense, the Department of the Treasury, the Depart-ment of Health and Human Services, the De-partment of the Interior, and the National Aer-onautics and Space Administration—and found that only five percent of the $4.3 billion available for advertising contracts went to mi-nority businesses. In light of these concerning figures, several of my colleagues and I sent a letter to the GAO in April 2016 requesting up-dated information on the amount of federal ad-vertising dollars spent with SDBs and busi-nesses owned by minorities and women. That GAO report, released in July of this year, showed that in fiscal year 2017, only 16 per-cent of the federal government’s advertising contract obligations went to SDBs and busi-nesses owned by minorities and women. The federal government is the largest adver-tiser in the United States, and it has an obliga-tion to ensure fair access to its contracts for SDBs and businesses owned by minorities and women. The GAO’s findings make it clear that there is still much progress to be made. The regular collection of information on fed-eral advertising contract obligations to SDBs and businesses owned by women and minori-ties, along with the provision of this informa-tion to legislators and stakeholders, is essen-tial to bridging the divide between current sta-tistics and a more inclusive advertising land-scape. My bill would achieve these goals while also promoting transparency and encouraging federal agencies to strive to reach minorities, who often receive their daily news from small-er media outlets that serve communities of color. The requirement that agencies submit prior, current, and projected information re-garding the amount of advertising dollars spent with SDBs and businesses owned by minorities and women will allow federal agen-cies to evaluate their progress over time. The regular collection of this information will also demonstrate that the promotion of equity in advertising, and in all areas of government, should be a continuous effort that is central to the mission of every agency. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. f 
CONGRATULATING GARY PERINAR ON RECEIVING THE GEORGE MEANY AWARD 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, December 3, 2018 Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. Gary Perinar who is being hon-ored with the George Meany Award in rec-ognition of his incredible contributions to the community and the working families of union trades. Mr. Perinar currently serves as execu-tive secretary-treasurer of the Chicago Re-gional Council of Carpenters, which consists of more than 30,000 workers pursuing careers in the trades. Mr. Perinar completed his apprenticeship with the Carpenters Local 174 before going on to become a 40-year member as a third-gen-eration business representative of the union. During Mr. Perinar’s stellar career he has taken on multiple roles, such as becoming a full-time business representative at the age of 32 and then assistant to the president. In addi-tion, Mr. Perinar performed multiple leadership roles on various committees and boards while serving as both a vice president and a dele-gate on the Regional Council. Under the lead-ership of Mr. Perinar, an emphasis was placed on both character and skills development in order to embody responsible citizenship. Mr. Perinar recognizes the investment that must be made in young people looking to build a career in the trades and I would like to con-gratulate him on all his efforts and accomplish-ments. It is because of dedicated leaders such as Mr. Gary Perinar that I am especially proud to serve Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I would like to again formally congratulate Mr. Gary Perinar on earning the George Meany Award for his exceptional service and thank him for all his contributions to the community.

HONORING UNIVERSITY OF ARI-ZONA-LED NASA MISSION OF OSIRIS-RE
XARRIVAL AT BENNU 
HON. RAU´L M. GRIJALVA 
OF ARIZONA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, December 3, 2018 Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of University of Arizona-led NASA mis-sion of spacecraft OSIRIS-REx and its suc-cessful arrival at the asteroid Bennu. Launched two years ago, the Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, Secu-rity-Regolith Explorer (OSIRIS-REx) mission is the first of its kind with a goal of returning a sample of the asteroid to Earth. Over the next year, the spacecraft will fly within close prox-imity of Bennu, map its surface, and use high-ly specialized instruments to collect a small sample from the asteroid that will be returned to Earth in 2023. This mission will aid sci-entists in investigating the most fundamental questions of our universe—namely how plan-ets formed and how life began. Further, OSI-RIS-REx will improve our understanding of as-teroids that have the potential to impact Earth. OSIRIS-REx will also determine Bennu’s physical and chemical properties, which will be critical to know in the event of an impact miti-gation mission. Asteroids like Bennu contain natural resources such as water, organics, and precious metals. In the future, these as-teroids may one day fuel the exploration of the solar system by robotic and manned space-craft. I am extremely proud that Tucson is once again a key player in a critical NASA mission, just as it has been with many others through-out our Nation’s history. OSIRIS-REx is an $800 million University of Arizona-led NASA mission and it’s traveling to Bennu because its regolith may record the earliest history of our solar system. Discovered in 1999, Bennu is relatively close to Earth with an orbit that crosses ours every six years. These close en-counters give Bennu a high probability of im-pacting Earth in the late 22nd century. Data collected from this mission will help predict Bennu’s movements and identify ways to de-flect asteroids in the future. Among all the as-teroids in space, Bennu was also selected be-cause it is large enough that a spacecraft can safely come in contact with it to collect sam-ples. Its diameter is wider than the height of the Empire State Building. By contrast, how-ever, Bennu will be the smallest object ever to be orbited by a spacecraft. The most unique aspect of the OSIRIS-REx mission is the large and pristine sample that will be brought back to Earth, which will allow scientists to research the origins of our uni-verse and galaxy and help us answer some of the most profound and fundamental questions that have intrigued mankind since our begin-nings. The OSIRIS-REx mission is funded by NASA and its science is led by the University of Arizona (UA). I would like to once again congratulate Dr. Dante Lauretta of the UA Lunar and Planetary Laboratory for his leader-ship as principal investigator and, along with his team, for bringing this exciting mission to the launch stage. I understand that Dante has been working on this concept for the last 15 years, and I greatly look forward to celebrating even more milestones with his team as the mission progresses. This mission is the latest in a long list of achievements by scientists at the University of Arizona in my home district. In fact, UA scientists have collaborated in every single American mission to the Moon and Mars since 1964, including serving as the lead on the Phoenix Mars Mission. The University of Arizona will house mission science operations control, as it did for the Phoenix Mars mission, continuing to involve undergraduate and graduate students in the research over—150 students so far, which will help cultivate the next generation of STEM leaders—many of whom will be from my home state of Arizona. I wish the OSIRIS REx team the best of luck in their historic mission and congratulate them in their profound success.

INTRODUCTION OF A BILL TO RE-QUIRE THE DIRECTOR OF THE COURT SERVICES AND OF-FENDER SUPERVISION AGENCY FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUM-BIA AND THE DIRECTOR OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA PRE-TRIAL SERVICES AGENCY TO RE-SIDE IN THE DISTRICT OF CO-LUMBIA 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, December 3, 2018 Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today, I intro-duce a bill to require the Director of the Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency for the District of Columbia (CSOSA) and the Dis-trict of Columbia Pretrial Services Agency (PSA) to reside in the District of Columbia dur-ing their tenure. CSOSA is an independent federal agency created by Congress in the Revitalization Act that supervises only D.C. offenders on parole, probation and supervised release. PSA is an independent agency within CSOSA that super-vises D.C. and federal defendants. This bill would be prospective and not apply to those already in office upon enactment. Congress has justifiably understood that federal officials must live in the jurisdiction they serve to ensure in-depth knowledge of the unique issues and challenges residents and these federal officials face, but federal of-ficials serving the District have been excluded from such a requirement. This patronizing left-over from when the District was governed by the federal government has real effects on residents. There is no reason that the Direc-tors of CSOSA and PSA, federal agencies that uniquely serve D.C. residents, should not be required to live in the District, engage with local communities and work closely with local officials. Adding residency requirements for federal officials serving the District is a matter of fairness that would make D.C. more like the states and even the territories, who enjoy resi-dency requirements. I strongly urge my colleagues to support this legislation. f 
HONORING MATTHEW TULLY

Most importantly, he was an even better person and I considered him a great friend. Matt is survived by his wife, Valerie, and their 7-year-old son, Reid. The Messer family will continue praying for his family as they mourn his passing.
