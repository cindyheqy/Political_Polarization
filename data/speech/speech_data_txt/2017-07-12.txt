CONGRATULATING FULBRIGHT RE-CIPIENTS FROM PENNSYLVA-NIA’S FIFTH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. T
HOMPSON ) for 5 minutes. Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 16 individuals from Pennsylvania’s Fifth Congressional District who have received prestigious Fulbright awards during the 2016–2017 school year. Congress established the Fulbright Program in 1946. It promotes friendly and peaceful relations between Ameri-cans and people of other countries through international educational ex-change. Each year, more than 3,000 U.S. students, scholars, artists, and profes-sionals in more than 100 different fields of study are offered Fulbright Program grants to lecture, study, teach English, and conduct research in more than 140 countries. Today, it is my privilege to recognize the following 16 individuals: Dr. Farshid Ahrestani of State Col-lege, Pennsylvania, a scholar of biol-ogy, whose host country was India; Dr. Luis Ayala Hernandez of State College, Pennsylvania, a scholar of en-gineering, whose host country was Co-lombia; Ms. Maria Barboza of Clarion, Penn-sylvania, a student with an English teaching apprenticeship, whose host country is Brazil; Dr. Samuel Bufford of State College, Pennsylvania, a scholar of law, whose host country was Romania; Ms. Alice Chen of Bradford, Pennsyl-vania, a student with an English teach-ing apprenticeship, whose host country was Taiwan; Ms. Talia Cowen of State College, Pennsylvania, a student with an English teaching apprenticeship, whose host country is South Korea; Dr. Zuleima Karpyn of State College, Pennsylvania, a scholar of engineering, whose host country was Colombia; Ms. Lauren Knoth of State College, Pennsylvania, a student of sociology, whose host country was Finland; Dr. Gerald LeTendre of Furnace, Pennsylvania, a scholar of education, whose host country was Japan; Dr. Anthony Robinson of State Col-lege, Pennsylvania, a scholar of geol-ogy, whose host country was Austria; Dr. Robert Roeser of State College, Pennsylvania, a scholar of psychology, whose host country is India; Dr. Heather Snyder of Waterford, Pennsylvania, a scholar of psychology, whose host country was the United Kingdom; Dr. Jacqueline Stefkovich of State College, Pennsylvania, a scholar of education, whose host country was Croatia; Ms. Ann Tarantino of State College, Pennsylvania, a scholar of the arts, whose host country was Brazil; Dr. Andrea Wyman of Edinboro, Pennsylvania, a scholar of library science, whose host country was Azer-baijan; and Dr. Karl Zimmerer of State College, Pennsylvania, a scholar of geography, whose host country is Spain. Congratulations to each and every one of you. You have earned this na-tional recognition with your years of study, leadership, and service, and our community is proud of you. Mr. Speaker, the Fulbright Program is one of the most sought-after ex-change programs in the world. It en-courages applications from individuals of academic and professional achieve-ment who are current and future lead-ers in their respective fields. Selected through open, merit-based competi-tion, Fulbrighters represent the excel-lence and diversity of their societies around the world and in the United States. Since 1946, more than 370,000 individ-uals from the United States and 180 countries have participated in the pro-gram, including 37 heads of state, 57 Nobel Laureates, 82 Pulitzer Prize win-ners, and 70 MacArthur Foundation Fellows. These relationships form a founda-tion of trust on which the United States may advance global peace and security. I know that the memorable learning experiences individuals en-counter through the program will never be forgotten. I thank all the Fulbrighters, espe-cially the 16 from Pennsylvania’s Fifth Congressional District. We are grateful

DEMOCRATIC VALUES The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. G
UTIE´RREZ ) for 5 minutes. Mr. GUTIE´RREZ. Mr. Speaker, I want to bring to everyone’s attention, especially my Democratic colleagues, a troubling incident that transpired over the recess. It is important that people hear about how women and the LGBT com-munity are treated at the highest lev-els of the current Puerto Rican govern-ment and the values and politics that run deeply throughout the politics of statehood for Puerto Rico. It is fair to say that in the era of Trump, admitting a Spanish-speaking Caribbean country as the 51st State would depend on the strength of demo-cratic votes, so it is important for my Democratic colleagues in particular to understand who the statehooders really are and what they really stand for, be-yond their rhetoric in Washington, D.C. The president of the senate in Puerto Rico, Thomas Rivera Schatz, is a key leader of the Statehood Party. In a re-cent interview on NotiUno radio, he was asked about the Financial Over-sight and Management Board, known as la Junta de Supervision Fiscal. This is the controversial board created by Congress a year ago to take over finan-cial and fiscal decisions in Puerto Rico and to prioritize the payment of Puerto Rico’s debt to Wall Street. I was one of the chief opponents of the PROMESA legislation that created the junta, and I have spoken out against it on numerous occasions. But it wasn’t what the statehood senate president said about the junta that was so offensive; it is how he talked in pub-lic about one of its board members—in fact, the only woman on the board and an appointee nominated by N
ANCY  P
ELOSI and the Democrats in the House. Ana Matosantos has impeccable, bi-partisan qualifications and also hap-pens to be an openly gay woman. So during the interview, the senate presi-dent and statehood leader referred to Ms. Matosantos as Mr. Matosantos, using the masculine pronoun ‘‘senor.’’ He did it multiple times so that lis-teners would not miss his disdain for lesbians and for women. It was no acci-dent or slip of the tongue. Given an op-portunity to apologize or backtrack, Rivera Schatz has declined to back down. This is not the first time he has dis-played his contempt for women and for the gay and lesbian community. His agenda is clear, and he knows he has many like-minded allies in Puerto Rico’s statehood movement. Every time he has had an oppor-tunity to block civil and human rights protections for LGBT individuals, he does so. He goes out of his way to belit-tle gay and lesbian citizens even when they are the victims of hate crimes. To be clear, I don’t see Rivera Schatz as one bad apple. He is a bad apple that exemplifies and is a voice for the other leaders in his party. So as a Puerto Rican and as a sup-porter of equality, all of this is deeply disturbing to me. Gender and LGBTQ equality issues are deeply engrained values of the Democratic Party, and I think they are core issues that bind Democrats together: issues of justice, opportunity, and fair play. So when the leaders of the statehood movement in Puerto Rico call upon Democrats in Congress to speak about equality and justice for Puerto Ricans, I want my colleagues to think about the agenda they are pursuing in Puerto Rico and the extent to which they have a very different approach to fairness and equality on the island. In closing, I would like to offer a few words to the Puerto Rican people in their own language, Spanish, and I will provide a translation to the desk. (English translation of the statement made in Spanish is as follows:) Core values of equality and fair treatment values I know most Puerto Ricans hold deeply in our hearts. So when the Statehood Party allows divisive and polarizing figures like Senator Rivera Schatz to be their face and their leading advocate in the Sen-ate, it makes me and many others skeptical about the arguments we hear from people who support statehood say the words ‘‘equality’’ and ‘‘justice’’ in Washington, but fight against equality and justice in Puerto Rico. How can they be taken seriously about equality when their agenda in the legislature is to take away those rights from women, the LGBT commu-nity, students, peaceful protesters and others? That is the fundamental hypocrisy I have pointed out to my Democratic colleagues, right now and in private meetings and correspondences. If the statehood movement is really committed to equality, they should act accordingly and not just use it as a slo-gan when it suits them. Los valores de la igualdad y del trato justo y equitativo son valores fundamentales que la mayorı´a de los puertorriquen˜os atesoramos profundamente en nuestros corazones. Ası´que cuando el Partido Estadista, el PNP, permite que figuras polarizantes y divisivas como el Senador Rivera Schatz sean su cara y su principal representante en el Senado, eso me hace a mı´y a muchos otros sentirnos esce´pticos en cuanto a los argumentos de los estadistas que usan palabras como ‘‘igualdad’’ y ‘‘justicia’’ en Washington, pero luchan en contra de la igualdad y la justicia en Puerto Rico. ¿Co´mo esperan que se les tome en serio al hablar de ‘‘igualdad’’ cuando su agenda en la Legislatura es el quitarles derechos a las mujeres, a la comunidad LGBT, a los estudiantes, y a los que se manifiestan y protestan pacı´ficamente? Esta es la fundamental hipocresı´a que le he sen˜alado a mis colegas Demo´cratas, aquı´, ahora, y en reuniones privadas, y a trave´s de correspondencia. Si el movimiento estadista en realidad tuviese un compromiso con la igualdad, actuarı´an conforme a la igualdad y no meramente usando el te´rmino como un lema cuando les conviene. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-tleman from Illinois will provide a translation of his remarks to the Clerk. f 
CELEBRATING THE PHILHOWER FAMILY’S 100TH ANNUAL FAMILY REUNION The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. L
ANCE ) for 5 minutes. Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, on Sep-tember 7, 2017, the Philhower family will have its 100th annual family re-union. I am proud to join my fellow family members in celebrating this very special occasion. My great-grand-mother was Elizabeth Philhower Lance. The Philhowers were some of the ear-liest settlers of Hunterdon County, New Jersey. The patriarch of the Philhower family was Philip Wulhauer, who emigrated from Germany on the ship the Patience, landing in the port of Philadelphia on September 16, 1738, at the age of 24. He met his wife, Anna Maria, on their voyage to the Colonies. Together they traveled to Hunterdon County, New Jersey, to start a new life. Philip went on to lease 14 acres in what is now Tewksbury Township in 1758 and established the Philhower homestead, which was first a log cabin that included one room and a loft. Shortly after, he built the house that still stands on the property. It was con-structed of mortar, lime, sand, and clay, and its walls are 18 inches thick. The Philhower homestead had grown to 100 acres when the house was com-pleted. The Philhowers have occupied the land since then and have spread their roots all over Hunterdon County, all over the State of New Jersey, and, indeed, all over the rest of the country. Among the family names entwined in the Philhowers are Apgar, Sutton, Fleming, Hoffman, and Lance. Philhowers have represented Hunterdon County in many of the mili-tary conflicts that have faced our Na-tion. They have also been farmers, mil-lers, physicians, ministers, merchants, bankers, and educators. In 1917, the Philhowers held their first family reunion at their home-stead, attended by nearly 400 descend-ants of Philip and Anna Maria. This fine tradition has continued over the last century, usually marked by a tur-key dinner, finance meeting, and ex-changing of family mementos at Cokesbury United Methodist Church in Hunterdon County. This year, however, family members will travel back to the

original Philhower homestead to be to-gether. Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to be a de-scendant of the Philhower family. This is but one example of the strong immi-grant tradition in this country that continues to be one of our greatest strengths as a nation, as much a strength today as in the middle of the 18th century. I am honored to share this milestone with colleagues in the United States House of Representatives and with the American people.

TWO-STATE SOLUTION The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. B
LUMENAUER ) for 5 min-utes. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, every time I visit Israel, I have such mixed feelings. It is a land of positive opportunities surrounded by intrac-table controversies. The big question looming is how to achieve a two-state solution for the Israelis and the Palestinians with ap-propriate integrity so that they are ac-tually separate countries. This has raised additional questions because of the ambiguity from the Trump admin-istration about whether or not what, for years, has been American policy supporting a two-state solution is any longer a priority of theirs. For several years, I have been deeply concerned about the looming environ-mental crisis in Gaza. This is a small strip of land about twice the size of Washington, D.C., but it is home to 1.9 million people, most of whom are lead-ing a wretched existence, even more so since Hamas, the political faction, has seized control. That is Israel’s implac-able enemy which now controls Gaza. They have little regard for their own people, using them as pawns, spending scarce resources, digging tunnels to try to kidnap Israeli children and soldiers, and launching rockets to terrorize Israeli communities in the surrounding areas. b1015 Gaza has reached a crisis point in dealing with water and sanitation. The groundwater is so polluted that vir-tually all the water is unfit to drink— polluted by sewage, waste runoff, and seawater encroachment. They are pumping four times as much water out of the aquifer than can be replaced nat-urally, and seawater from the Medi-terranean is encroaching. We are told that, by the end of the year, there will probably be no sources of drinking water that are fit to drink. By 2020, the entire water system will be permanently damaged. Because of problems with drinking water that is not fit and raw sewage that is not treated, there is a real likelihood that we could have an outbreak of some-thing like cholera, threatening not just the people in Gaza, but the Israelis as well. Several times recently, sewage from Gaza has washed up on Israeli beaches and forced the shutdown of water treatment plants from desalinization. The Israeli military thinks this is a se-curity threat. In the course of this visit, I had an opportunity to put the question di-rectly to Prime Minister Netanyahu; Jibril Rajoub, the number three person in the Palestinian Authority; and United States Ambassador Friedman about this pending crisis and the need for urgent action. Sadly, each of those conversations revealed I won’t say in-difference, but certainly a lack of ur-gency and no willingness for anybody to take the lead and break the impasse. This is not a problem that is beyond our ability to solve. There are opportu-nities to increase electricity for pump-ing water and treating sewage. There is the capacity to build some smaller res-ervoirs to be able to mix saltwater with freshwater and extend the sup-plies. For Israel, water is a mystery they have solved. They are the most water- rich country on the face of the planet, with very sophisticated technology. They could provide additional re-sources. Around the edges, the United States does some work with USAID, but it is not a priority for the United States at this point. Mr. Speaker, I return perplexed. We will continue to push with the Israelis, the United States Government, the Palestinians, and with NGOs whenever we have the opportunity. But it seems to me, Mr. Speaker, if we cannot bring people together to solve a pending cri-sis with tools that are available to us now, at a relatively modest cost, what hope do we have of being able to work cooperatively to implement the two- state solution and be able to bring peace and security to Israel and the Palestinians? I would hope my colleagues would lend their voices to this question.

SERBIAN GOVERNMENT MUST STEP UP AND DO THE RIGHT THING The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York (Mr. Z
ELDIN ) for 5 minutes. Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss my resolution, H. Con. Res 30. In July of 1999, three brothers—Ylli, 25 years old; Agron, 23 years old; and Mehmet Bytyqi, 21 years old—who were born in the United States and resided in Hampton Bays, New York, went overseas towards the end of the Kosovo war to fight mass war crimes aimed to eradicate the civilian Albanian popu-lation from Kosovo. These three men left the comfort and safety of their homes in the U.S. to em-bark on a civilian humanitarian mis-sion. They were trying to stop abroad those horrific crimes against human-ity. During that civilian humanitarian mission, they were arrested after acci-dentally crossing into Serbian-con-trolled territory. Two weeks later, they were given a judicial order of release. Instead, the brutal execution of these men followed shortly after, and it was not until 2001, 2 years later, that their remains were found in a mass grave. While Serbian authorities have inves-tigated the deaths of the brothers, there have been no charges brought against those responsible for those murders. Moreover, the main suspect remains a prominent member of the governing political party. Today we remember Ylli, Agron, and Mehmet, who were senselessly and bru-tally murdered 18 years ago. Since taking office over 2 years ago, I have been committed to helping the Bytyqi family receive the justice they have long deserved. I have been in con-tact with the family as we work to re-solve this. In the last Congress, I introduced H. Con. Res. 51, calling for justice to be served in these horrible murders, and imploring the Serbian Government to make it a priority that this must be properly investigated and that those suspects be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. I am proud to have reintroduced this legislation in the 115th Congress as H. Con. Res. 20. It is absolutely reprehensible that, despite many promises by Serbian offi-cials to resolve this case, no individual has ever been found guilty of this hor-rible crime, nor of any crimes associ-ated with the deaths of these innocent Americans. It is the responsibility of the Serbian Government to resolve this case, and my resolution notes that progress into this investigation should remain a sig-nificant factor which determines the further development of U.S.-Serbian relations. Their inaction on finding and prosecuting those responsible is an in-sult not only to the memory of Ylli, Agron, Mehmet, and the Bytyqi family, but to every American. The Bytyqi brothers gave their lives to fight injustice. It is now upon us to return this favor and deliver justice for their family. Those responsible for these unspeakable acts against our citizens must face the law. It is vital that the Serbian Government steps up and does what is right. Eighteen years later, it is time we put an end to this sad story.

CELEBRATING 150TH ANNIVER-SARY OF NEW LIGHT BEULAH BAPTIST CHURCH The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. C
LYBURN ) for 5 minutes. Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor New Light Beulah Bap-tist Church of Hopkins, South Caro-lina, on the occasion of its 150th anni-versary. Many members of the con-gregation have traveled here to Wash-ington, D.C., from South Carolina to

observe this tribute, and have joined us here in the gallery. New Light Beulah Baptist Church grew out of Beulah Baptist Church, which was a place of worship for Whites and African Americans. In De-cember of 1867, several years after the effective date of the Emancipation Proclamation, many newly freed slaves began exercising their new-found free-doms by taking control of their own af-fairs. Consequently, the 565 African- American members of the congregation began worshipping on alternating Sun-days from the 11 White members of Beulah Baptist Church. In 1870, after the dispersal of the White congregation, the African-Amer-ican members of Beulah Baptist Church further asserted their independ-ence by renaming the church New Light Beulah Baptist Church. After a number of disputes over the church’s land, the congregation decided to build a brush arbor on the land of Deacon Pharaoh Smith, a revered lead-er within the church. Over the fol-lowing years, this humble brush arbor evolved into the thriving spiritual cen-ter that New Light Beulah Baptist Church has become today. New Light Beulah Baptist Church embodies the resilience and service of the African-American community. Forged from adversity, this congrega-tion has stood strong throughout tu-multuous times, both externally and internally. Their strength comes not from the brick and mortar within which they worship, but from God’s good graces and the steadfast individ-uals who have labored in this historic church. The church has been a leader in Hop-kins, South Carolina, a small rural community southeast of Columbia, the State’s capital. Through various com-munity-oriented initiatives, such as their child development program, Meals on Wheels, the Neighboring Christian Athletic Association, and the Educational Society, the congregation has positively impacted the entire community. Next month, New Light Beulah Bap-tist Church will become the first Afri-can-American church in the Hopkins community to be registered as a his-toric place by the South Carolina De-partment of Archives and History. I congratulate them on this special rec-ognition. Mr. Speaker, it is my great honor to represent this fine congregation in this august body. I ask my colleagues in the United States House of Representatives to join me in congratulating New Light Beulah Baptist Church on their 150th anniversary and wishing them contin-ued prosperity in the days ahead.

The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. W
AGNER ) for 5 minutes. Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call on the U.S. House of Rep-resentatives to bring my bipartisan Allow States and Victims to Fight On-line Sex Trafficking Act to the floor. Yesterday, The Washington Post re-vealed that backpage.com hired a con-tractor to solicit and create illegal sex trafficking ads. This confirms yet again what we have long known about Backpage: it is an online slave market that actively sells America’s innocent women and children for sex. If a business in America held a slave auction, it is impossible for me to imagine that the auctioneer would be able to carry on with impunity. After all, we amended the U.S. Constitution to ban slavery of all forms in the United States many years ago. But this is exactly what is happening with backpage.com. Backpage is selling our children into sex slavery, and we must hold them accountable. Backpage and other online slave mar-kets can sell America’s children over and over again because courts have misinterpreted section 230 of the Com-munications Decency Act to shield websites from criminal liability for the sex trafficking advertisements that they facilitate. But the Communications Decency Act, passed over 20 years ago, was never intended to create a lawless internet where people can commit sex crimes online that they cannot commit offline. In fact, this misinterpretation of the CDA is the height of irony. Speaking in favor of the CDA in 1995, then-Senator Exon said: ‘‘The informa-tion superhighway should not become a red-light district. Once this bill passes, our children and families will be better protected from those who would elec-tronically cruise the digital world to engage children in inappropriate com-munications and introductions.’’ How sad his words ring today. The CDA, meant originally to protect chil-dren, has become now a safe harbor for America’s pimps. The tech industry is rallying against any changes to the CDA, but freedom of speech online and the enforcement of the Nation’s sex trafficking laws are in no way mutu-ally exclusive. Sex trafficking is not a prerequisite of the free and open inter-net. Last year, in Jane Doe v. Backpage, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit made clear that legislation is the only remedy to any conflict be-tween the CDA and America’s sex traf-ficking laws. b1030 In other words, Congress must clarify to the courts that the Communications Decency Act does not protect sex traf-ficking, and that is precisely what the Allow States and Victims to Fight On-line Sex Trafficking Act will do. We must bring this legislation to the floor and take a stand for victims across the country. We cannot claim to be antitrafficking advocates, then close our eyes and give a free pass to the websites that sell our children.

HONORING FIRST RESPONDERS OF ARIZONA’S SECOND CONGRES-SIONAL DISTRICT The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. M
CSALLY ) for 5 minutes. Ms. M
CSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding in-dividuals in my congressional district who I was proud to award as First Re-sponders of Distinction earlier this week. We all benefit from the sacrificial work of our first responders, whether we have personally experienced it as they responded to our emergency or whether we indirectly benefit from it by enjoying the safety that they pro-vide. The everyday acts of heroism by first responders in our community often go uncelebrated. They keep our streets safe, put their lives on the line during emergencies, provide assistance when-ever needed, and save lives. Above and beyond even that standard of greatness, there are outstanding first responders in my district who serve southern Arizona in truly ex-traordinary ways. These individuals or-ganize community races, develop emer-gency preparedness training, log hun-dreds of volunteer hours, launch public education campaigns, and provide meals for disabled seniors. That is why I created the First Re-sponders of Distinction Award to shine a spotlight on individuals who make extraordinary contributions in our community. This year, we reached a significant number of nominations, and I was pleased to recognize each one for the role they play. Our winner in the indi-vidual category goes to Lieutenant Mertie Stompro, who has served in the Sierra Vista Police Department for 20 years. His many leadership roles in-clude team leader for the Sierra Vista Police Department Tactical Unit and founding member of the Sierra Vista Police Department’s Special Response Team. Mertie distinguished himself as the sergeant overseeing firearms training for the department. He developed force- on-force training to simulate real-life scenarios that officers face in the com-munity. His steadfast approach to chal-lenging officers in the training envi-ronment has greatly improved the skill level and preparedness of all ranks in the Sierra Vista Police Department. In his spare time, Lieutenant Stompro has coordinated an annual Foot Pursuit 5K. It is a race that has become the largest organized race in the Sierra Vista area and fosters posi-tive interaction between law enforce-ment and the community.

Last year, it raised $6,000 for the an-nual Christmas with a Cop event spon-sored by the Sierra Vista Police Offi-cers’ Association. In this photo, you can see Lieutenant Stompro engaging with a child at Christmas with a Cop, which gives 100 underprivileged chil-dren in Cochise County the oppor-tunity to spend $100 on whatever they wish to purchase. For the last 2 years, during the Na-tional Bike and Walk to School Week, he comes in to work before shift and transforms one of the armored vehicles into a Batmobile, driving Batman and Ghostbuster around each school in the Sierra Vista neighborhoods to interact with the kids. Lieutenant Stompro has also worked tirelessly over the last several years to develop emergency preparedness train-ing exercises in the local schools and developed a lasting partnership with the Sierra Vista Unified School Dis-trict. He took the lead in developing exercises to coordinate efforts in the event of an active shooter situation. Lieutenant Stompro embodies the Si-erra Vista Police Department’s mantra of ‘‘Service with Honor,’’ and we are fortunate to have him in our commu-nity. Our team winner for 2017 is the Davis-Monthan Air Force Base 355th Civil Engineering Squadron Fire Emer-gency Services, pictured here receiving their award. Davis-Monthan’s Fire Emergency Services team provides fire, rescue, emergency medical, and com-bat support in 25 operating bases year round. In the past year, they hosted over 500 firefighters from 12 neighboring depart-ments, three local fire academies and local law enforcement agencies, and joint SWAT/Rescue Task Force train-ing. In the last year, this team provided more than 150 hours of fire prevention education, supporting over 300 children at Borman Elementary and Sonoran Science Academy. Additionally, they volunteered 250 hours to Habitat for Humanity, Tanque Verde Little League, STARBASE, Pima Interagency Training Committee, Arizona Center for Fire Service Excellence, the Public Safety and Emergency Services Insti-tute, and numerous other organiza-tions. Despite being 30 percent under-manned, they protect $50 billion in as-sets and 14,000 personnel. Even with the diverse demands, they were able to combine their experience, hard work, and talent to garner the prestigious milestone of Commission on Fire Ac-creditation International, an honor only 230 departments in the world have earned. Mr. Speaker, these are just two ex-amples of the heroic and extraordinary first responders we are blessed to have serving in my district. We will never fully be able to repay these individuals for the way they shaped and improved our lives, but we can applaud them and offer our sincerest gratitude. Before I yield back, I want to point out I am standing here in my profes-sional attire, which happens to be a sleeveless dress and open-toed shoes.

As the spiritual leader of the Arme-nians on the West Coast, I bring the intercession of my flock, and I ask You O Lord to grant wisdom, compassion, and righteousness to all Congressmen and Congresswomen so that they may lead this country through the paths of justice, liberty, and equality. Compassionate God, forgive the sins of all Your servants and make them vessels of Your divine will so that in all their endeavors they may remember Your commandments and act according to the United States’ national interests in defense of the country’s sovereignty. This I ask in Your holy Name. Amen.

PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER. Will the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. W
ILSON ) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. WILSON of South Carolina led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Repub-lic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. WELCOMING ARCHBISHOP HOVNAN DERDERIAN The SPEAKER. Without objection, the gentleman from California (Mr. S
CHIFF ) is recognized for 1 minute. There was no objection. Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize my friend, Archbishop Hovnan Derderian, Primate of the Western Diocese of the Armenian Church of North America, and to thank him for delivering the opening prayer on the House floor today. Archbishop Derderian has had a tre-mendous impact on people of all faiths and has played a vital role in the reli-gious and civic life of millions. Since his election as primate in 2003, Archbishop Derderian has been a dedi-cated religious servant for the thou-sands of congregants who look to him for guidance, managing a diocese which covers the Western United States. In the large Armenian-American di-aspora community that I am proud to represent, Archbishop Derderian is an articulate and steadfast voice for the values of faith, family, and community service that are at the core of the Ar-menian people’s perseverance and strength. Archbishop Derderian and the West-ern Diocese have joined other religious and community leaders in rallying sup-port and aid for Armenia, Artsakh, and for refugees fleeing the horrors of civil war in Syria and Iraq. I thank the Archbishop for all that he does to make our community and our Nation stronger. I am proud that Congress today was able to hear the moral leadership he brings to his work in the Western Diocese.

PANAMA CITY BEACH HUMAN CHAIN (Mr. DUNN asked and was given per-mission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the bravery and the inge-nuity of more than 80 beachgoers in Panama City Beach last weekend. As many were enjoying the crystal blue waters of the Gulf, a family of six and four others became caught up in a rip-tide. Losing strength to fight their way back to shore, the swimmers screamed for help and faced a tragic fate. Thankfully, ordinary citizens did something extraordinary. One of them was Jessica Simmons, who noticed the struggling swimmers from a nearby sandbar. She said to herself: ‘‘Those people are not drowning today.’’ Jes-sica helped coordinate dozens of others to form a human chain from the shore

all the way out to the distressed swim-mers, ultimately bringing all of them to shore and saving their lives. It is a testament to the generosity of the human spirit to see complete strangers quite literally join hands to help those in need. On behalf of the Second District, I thank Jessica Simmons and all who fought the churning currents of Pan-ama City Beach on Saturday. May we all learn from their example.

REMEMBERING THE VICTIMS OF THE NEWARK REBELLION AND OCCUPATION (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, on July 12, 1967, a fire of rebellion sparked in my hometown and led to 5 days of conflict. Today we acknowledge the 50th anni-versary of the Newark riots, or as the citizens called it, the Newark Rebellion and Occupation, and we memorialize the 26 people who lost their lives in those turbulent 5 days: Rose Abraham, Elizabeth Artis, Mary Helen Campbell, Eloise Spellman, Eddie Moss, Captain Michael Moran, Isaac Harrison, Frederick Toto, Robert Martin, Albert Mersier, Jr., Rufus Hawk, William Furr, Oscar Hill, Tedock Bell, Michael Pugh, Jessie Mae Jones, James Rutledge, Leroy Boyd, Rebecca Brown, Hattie Gainer, Raymond Gilmer, Cornelius Murray, Victor Louis Smith, James Sanders, Richard Taliaferro, and Rufus Council. Mr. Speaker, those were turbulent days in the city’s history, but we have not forgotten and we have learned great lessons from that time. May we also never forget these lives that per-ished in those 5 days.

HOUSE COMBATS HUMAN TRAFFICKING (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to ad-dress the House for 1 minute and to re-vise and extend his remarks.) Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, today the House of Represent-atives will consider three critical bills that will continue efforts to reduce and eliminate human trafficking and im-plement a stronger detection system for American families. I appreciate the leadership of Con-gressman C
HRIS SMITH, Congressman TIMWALBERG , and Congresswoman V
ICKY HARTZLER for their work to build a more effective system to apprehend traffickers. As we take steps at the national level to prevent trafficking, equip local offi-cials, and support vulnerable commu-nities, I am grateful that the South Carolina Human Trafficking Task Force led by State Attorney General Alan Wilson has been a pioneer in statewide efforts to combat human trafficking. Under his leadership, South Carolina has one of the strong-est human trafficking laws in the coun-try and has successfully worked for prosecution, protection, prevention, and partnership. I am encouraged by South Carolina’s commitment to protecting the dignity, freedom, and human rights of all citi-zens, and I hope their success can build a model for other States. In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.

SENATE BILL HURTS AMERICANS (Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York asked and was given permis-sion to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, once again, tomor-row, Senate Republicans will take an-other shot at passing the most widely hated and totally disastrous bill in modern American history—their bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Once again, 22 million Americans will stand to lose their health insur-ance. Once again, Republicans will pro-pose to send premiums and out-of- pocket costs soaring. Once again, Re-publicans would allow insurance com-panies to discriminate against the sick. Once again, they will try to pass a law that hurts children, veterans, seniors, and Americans with disabilities. They seem desperately determined to pass something instead of doing the right thing—which would be working on a bill that treats healthcare as a fundamental American right—and that is as wrong as wrong can be.

OFFICER DOWN: MIGUEL MORENO—TEXAS LAWMAN (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, Peace Officers Miguel Moreno and Julio Cavazos of the San Antonio Po-lice Department were responding to a routine call when they were ap-proached by two individuals. Suddenly, one dastardly criminal pulled out a firearm and began shooting at both of-ficers. As the shots rang out, both officers were hit. 32-year-old Officer Moreno took a bullet to the chest, collapsing to the ground. Officer Cavazos ran to his fellow officer, Moreno, pulling him out of the line of fire despite being shot himself. He fired back at the outlaw, hitting the mark; and, in my opinion, justice was then served. Despite Cavazos’ quick actions, 32- year-old Officer Moreno succumbed to his injuries. Another life needlessly stolen from the thin blue line. Miguel Moreno was a 9-year veteran of the force. He woke up each morning ready to serve and protect his commu-nity. His life was stolen by an evil vil-lain with no socially redeeming value. Moreno stood for everything that is good in America. As we mourn his loss, we should thank the good Lord that such people as he ever lived. He was part of the rare breed, the American breed. Our peace officers are the best we have. America needs to stand with peace officers. We should stand with the thin blue line—the line that sepa-rates the lawful from the lawless. God bless Officer Moreno and his family. And that is just the way it is. f 
INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS IN BUFFALO, NEW YORK (Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, The Buffalo News, in a fea-ture story this week, highlighted the impressive development of the once dormant urban streets in Buffalo, New York; streets like Niagara Street, Main Street, and Ohio Street. What these road projects have in common in their resurgence is a smart and targeted Federal commitment to infrastructure that has been success-fully leveraged to yield significant pri-vate investment and achieve the max-imum benefit for our community and for the Nation. Buffalo—long ago humbled by eco-nomic devastation—is now a national model for communities nationwide in showing how infrastructure invest-ments can create jobs and improve the life quality of communities. Infrastructure investment creates jobs in the construction trades and supply and materials industry imme-diately and unleashes the investment of the private sector in a cause-and-ef-fect economic response. Buffalo has come a long way, and we still have a long way to go. The lessons of our success can and should be shared with the Nation through this institu-tion.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H5443 July 12, 2017 
After attending both Grand Valley State University and Wayne State Uni-versity, Bill received a degree in crimi-nal justice from Madonna University. He began his career in law enforcement in 1976 as a Michigan State Police trooper, where he served for 25 years protecting our great State. In 2001, just one day after he retired from the Michigan State Police, Bill Olney joined the Zeeland Police De-partment, where he served as our chief of police for 16 years. Chief Olney has dedicated his career to providing the highest quality law enforcement service and profes-sionalism to the residents of Zeeland. His relentless work for our committee and dedication is clearly reflected by the numerous awards and commenda-tions he has received over his career. Chief Olney has served on the West Michigan Criminal Justice Training Consortium, Ottawa Substance Abuse Prevention Coalition, and Stop Child Abuse and Neglect Council. As a lifelong Detroit Lions and Michigan State Spartans fan, I know he will enjoy his retirement with his wife, Kathryn; and his children, Shan-non and Matt. I think some football is in his kids’ future. Mr. Speaker, I want to ask my col-leagues to join me in saying ‘‘thank you’’ on behalf of the Second District of Michigan as we thank Chief Bill Olney for his 41 years of service to the State of Michigan and to our country.

b1215 PROTECT NET NEUTRALITY (Ms. GABBARD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, net neutrality is something that is funda-mental to our country. It is rooted in our First Amendment rights. It allows for an open marketplace, exchange of ideas, center for innovation, hub for communication, and so much more. In today’s digital age, especially, en-suring an open, free, and equal internet for all—not just for those who can af-ford to pay to play—is crucial to level the playing field for everyone. The FCC’s current proposal rolls back these freedoms for the benefit and profit of big internet service providers on the backs of students, entrepreneurs and innovators, small businesses, and all of us. Millions across the country have already sent in comments to the FCC expressing their strong opposition. On today’s net neutrality day of ac-tion, I encourage everyone to make their voices heard. In just 5 days, the FCC public comment period closes. Now is the time for us to raise our voices to protect net neutrality, fair-ness, and equality for all.

MAJORITY OF VOTERS BACK PRESIDENT’S TRAVEL VETTING (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, a recent Politico/Morning Consult poll shows that 60 percent of registered vot-ers support ‘‘new guidelines which say visa applicants from six predominantly Muslim countries must prove a close family relationship with a U.S. resi-dent in order to enter the country.’’ Only 28 percent oppose. Also, respond-ents trust Republicans in Congress more than Democrats to handle the issue of immigration. The new, nationwide poll dem-onstrates strong approval by the elec-torate for the President’s effort to keep America safe, despite a question slant-ed to make respondents think his ac-tion is based on religion. Had the question noted that the six nations that require additional visa scrutiny were also selected by the Obama administration as national se-curity threats, the poll likely would have revealed even more support for the new guidelines. When it comes to immigration pol-icy, the American people support the President. f 
TRAINING SCHOOLS IN SEX TRAFFICKING AWARENESS (Mrs. DAVIS of California asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speak-er, many people think of human traf-ficking as a problem that is happening abroad, but what they don’t realize is that hundreds of thousands of victims are being trafficked within our own borders. It is hard to imagine such an injus-tice occurring in your own neighbor-hood. When I learned that my city of San Diego is considered a high-inten-sity region for child trafficking, I knew I needed to take action. In San Diego, we have an incredible community antitrafficking task force. They told me that a gap in the fight against trafficking is in our schools. This is why I wrote the Empowering Educators to Prevent Trafficking Act. I am proud to see it included in the Frederick Douglass Trafficking Vic-tims Protection Act that is before us today. My bill will fund programs to train teachers across the country to recog-nize and respond to signs of trafficking so that they can identify victims and get them the help they need. Teachers, in turn, can teach their students how to protect themselves from becoming victims. With this training, our Nation’s schools can be an important line of de-fense against this terrible injustice.

RECOGNIZING GASPERI FAMILY (Mr. FITZPATRICK asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Gasperi family, who will be moving to Kenya in August on a mission to bring clean, fresh water to the schools in the sur-rounding area. The Gasperi family seeks to provide clean water to schools in the city of Nakuru. Clean water will help the Kenyans avoid waterborne parasites and illnesses that interfere with child-hood education. Ashley Gasperi grew up in Kenya, and, with her husband, Chris, started a nonprofit called Ekenywa, which means a new beginning. Their mission is to improve the quality of life for school-aged children in Kenya and to eradicate poverty. Both Chris and Ashley hold their master’s degrees in nursing. Chris serves as a nurse manager at St. Mary Medical Center’s orthopedic center, and Ashley serves as a clinical instruc-tor at Temple University. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the entire Eighth Congressional District of Penn-sylvania, we are so proud of the Gasperi family. We wish them the best as they work to provide a brighter fu-ture and cleaner water for all the chil-dren of Kenya. f 
HONORING OUR COMMITMENT TO VETERANS (Mr. O’ROURKE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. O’ROURKE. Mr. Speaker, there are tens of thousands of veterans in this country who have served this country; put their lives on the line, lit-erally; and saved the lives of countless other servicemembers who, because of their service, have mental healthcare- related conditions like post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, which con-tributed to them having an other than honorable discharge. Mr. Speaker, with an other than hon-orable discharge, those veterans are unable to go into a VA and see a men-tal healthcare provider, despite the fact that they are more than two times likely to take their own lives. Now that we all know this, I hope that Members will join me in cospon-soring the Honor Our Commitment Act, which I introduced with M
IKE B
OSTin the House and C HRIS MURPHY  in the Senate. It is bipartisan and bi-cameral. It honors our commitment and obligation to those servicemem-bers who did right by this country, and it will save lives. I look forward to the full support of this Chamber, passage of this bill, and having the President sign it into law.

from my district who is severely im-pacted by autism and has made a posi-tive difference in thousands of lives in south Florida. How has he done this? Mr. Speaker, for years, Robert has helped train 6,000 Miami police officers, firefighters, and EMTs to identify peo-ple with developmental issues and tai-lor their actions and responses accord-ingly. With Robert’s help, officers and first responders in south Florida are trained to de-escalate volatile emer-gency situations involving individuals on the autism spectrum or with mental illness. Robert’s assistance in emergency re-sponse training has not only helped of-ficers to connect with autism patients on an emotional level, but it has also made a positive impact and has saved many lives in our south Florida com-munity. I thank Robert for his tireless work and participation in police and first re-sponder training for more than 10 years. His efforts have helped make south Florida an even better commu-nity for all of us. Thank you, Robert.

NAS REPORT ON THE VALUE OF SBE SCIENCES (Mr. LIPINSKI asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight the findings of a re-cent report by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine entitled: ‘‘The Value of Social, Behav-ioral, and Economic Sciences to Na-tional Priorities.’’ This report was re-quested by the National Science Foun-dation to examine whether the Federal Government should continue funding research in these disciplines. The re-sounding answer is: yes. The report found that SBE funding furthers the mission of NSF and helps other agencies achieve their missions, and this funding provides tools and methods that have helped business and industry grow the U.S. economy and create jobs. The report also highlights that vir-tually every major challenge the coun-try faces today requires understanding the causes and consequences of people’s behavior. The way we do this is by funding research in the social, behav-ioral, and economic sciences. Mr. Speaker, investments in SBE are critical for our Nation’s future, and we must continue this robust investment.

RECOGNIZING LEDVANCE (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to ad-dress the House for 1 minute and to re-vise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, for the past 100 years, people in St. Marys, Pennsylvania, have been producing light for the world. Earlier this week, I had the oppor-tunity to visit the LEDVANCE manu-facturing facility and visit with em-ployees. St. Marys is located at the eastern edge of the Allegheny National Forest in the Pennsylvania Fifth Dis-trict. It is a town this has a rich and storied history of being a leader in manufacturing. The LEDVANCE facility in St. Marys manufactures nearly 2 million incan-descent and halogen light bulbs—and soon, LED light bulbs—each day, in 1,700 packages and varieties. Its em-ployees are skilled, knowledgeable, an dedicated to their craft. They are pro-ducing state-of-the-art lighting solu-tions right in the heart of north cen-tral Pennsylvania. LEDVANCE has locations through-out North America and is a global lead-er in advancing light with LED, tradi-tional and smart lighting, and acces-sories. It was a privilege to tour the St. Marys facility and meet with the tal-ented local employees who work dili-gently each day to produce a quality product. Congratulations to our workforce in St. Marys on 100 years of knowledge and expertise to advance light around the world. f 
IMMIGRATION REFORM (Mr. POLIS asked and was given per-mission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight the need for bipartisan im-migration reform. Until Congress addresses our broken immigration system; secures our bor-der; provides a pathway for people who have been here a long time to be able to eventually earn full citizenship; and provides a way for people who are here illegally and required to register, get right with the law, and get in line be-hind those who have come legally, it will remain a problem in cities and communities across our entire country. There has been a failure of leadership in this body, the United States Con-gress, to actually address our broken immigration system. There has been a failure from both sides to provide a pathway forward for a problem that only Congress can solve, and that will only get larger until we take it up here. Last week, I visited the ICE deten-tion facility in Aurora, Colorado. I wit-nessed and talked to family members and mothers who had been taken away from their American children over something as minor as a speeding tick-et. We can, and we must, do better as a nation. We need an immigration sys-tem that reflects that we are both a nation of laws and a nation of immi-grants. I call upon my Republican and Democratic colleagues to work to-gether to achieve this end.

GENERAL LEAVE  
Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-tend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Alabama? There was no objection. Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, House Res-olution 431 provides for full consider-ation, including making six amend-ments in order to H.R. 23, the Gaining Responsibility on Water Act, and al-lows us to begin consideration of H.R. 2810, the National Defense Authoriza-tion Act for Fiscal Year 2018. H.R. 23 is legislation necessary to deal with the severe water supply crisis facing California and other Western States. The region has experienced the worst drought in over 1,000 years, and many Western communities have been very negatively impacted. This commonsense legislation fixes the broken regulatory system that is only exacerbating the impact of the drought conditions. The current regu-latory system is overly complex and in-consistent. Making matters worse, var-ious court decisions have only further complicated efforts to resolve these issues. For example, this bill will help bring California’s water infrastructure into the 21st century. The current water storage and delivery system is designed to serve approximately 22 million peo-ple, but the State currently has 37 mil-lion residents. The bill is not only important to peo-ple in California. In fact, around half of our Nation’s fruits and vegetables come from California. Every American could be hit in the pocketbook at the grocery store or checkout line if the California drought is allowed to con-tinue. Through this legislation, we can help expand water infrastructure and allow for greater water conveyance while en-suring environmental and water rights protections. Passing H.R. 23 will di-rectly help address the drought crisis and benefit families, farms, the envi-ronment, and the American economy. The rule also allows us to begin con-sideration of the National Defense Au-thorization Act. The bill provides for general debate and makes in order 88 amendments, including 41 minority amendments and 20 bipartisan amend-ments. Another rule is expected tomor-row to provide for consideration of ad-ditional amendments. This open process actually started in the Armed Services Committee on which I serve. At the committee level, 275 amendments were offered, and 231 amendments were adopted during our committee markup last month. I have said this many times on this floor, but it is worth saying again: there is no greater responsibility of the Federal Government than to provide for the safety and security of the American people. This year’s NDAA does just that by reforming, repairing, and rebuilding the United States mili-tary. The bill addresses the realities of the dangerous threat environment facing our Nation and ensures our troops and their families have the necessary re-sources and benefits. Over the last decade, we have cut our military at an alarming rate. As the threats rack up, we have planes that can’t fly, ships that can’t sail, and sol-diers who can’t deploy. We must re-verse this readiness crisis. Thankfully, there is bipartisan sup-port for boosting our Nation’s military. In fact, this bill passed out of the Armed Services Committee by a vote of 60–1, continuing a strong bipartisan tradition of passing NDAAs. I want to briefly highlight just a few of the positive provisions of this legis-lation. The bill increases total military spending by 10 percent to rebuild the military from the current readiness crisis. This includes increasing the size of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Army Guard and Reserve, Naval and Air Re-serve, and Air Guard. Given the serious threat posed by North Korea, the bill boosts missile de-fense programs, including adding an additional $2.5 billion above the Presi-dent’s budget request. The bill also authorizes the construc-tion of 13 new Navy ships, including three more littoral combat ships, as we work to grow toward a 355-ship fleet. It funds a 2.4 percent pay raise for our troops and extends special pay and bo-nuses for servicemembers. Importantly, the bill continues to ad-vance Chairman THORNBERRY ’s priority of reforming and strengthening the military’s acquisition process to make it more effective and efficient. Given the evolving threats related to cyber, the bill improves the oversight of cyber operations. The bill also helps set policy for the U.S. military relating to Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq, Ukraine, Russia, Africa, and the Asian Pacific region. All told, this bill achieves important priorities of reforming, repairing, and rebuilding our military. Each and every day, more than 2 mil-lion men and women put on the uni-form of the United States and serve our country. As we have seen by two recent tragedies, the Marine plane crash in Mississippi and the USS Fitzgerald col-lision off the coast of Japan, these indi-viduals put their lives on the line in order to protect the freedoms we all hold dear. They deserve the resources necessary to fulfill their mission and the benefits worthy of those who sac-rifice so much. So I am hopeful we can continue to move forward in a bipartisan manner to pass this NDAA, to support our troops, and to fulfill our constitutional obligation to provide for the common defense. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 431 and the underlying bills, and I reserve the bal-ance of my time. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the cus-tomary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH5446 July 12, 2017 
Gaining Responsibility on Water Act. First let me address that act. They tried to create an acronym called the GROW Act, Gaining Respon-sibility on Water, trying to make it seem like it actually might help things grow, when it actually picks winners and losers in water—and the losers are the environment, the State of Cali-fornia, and many others. There are also a lot of problems around the process for the GROW Act. It bypassed hearings and markups. In fact, up until this bill was published on the Rules Committee website, only lob-byists and a few Republicans even knew what many of the provisions in this bill were. This kind of backroom dealmaking is one of the reasons the general public holds Congress in such low esteem. There is an immense amount of oppo-sition to this legislation, including from conservation groups, fishing groups, Native American Tribes, and the State of California. Mr. Speaker, I have several letters that I include in the R
ECORD in regard to opposition to H.R. 23. One of the let-ters is signed by groups ranging from the American Bird Conservancy to the Animal Welfare Institute, to the Hu-mane Society and a number of others, discussing how this bill would dramati-cally weaken protections for salmon, birds, and other fish and wildlife. Another letter that I include in the R
ECORD is from a former colleague of ours, now the attorney general of the State of California, Xavier Becerra, and, finally, a letter from the Governor of California as well. 
PLEASE OPPOSE H.R. 23 J
ULY11, 2017. D
EAR REPRESENTATIVE : On behalf of the undersigned organizations, we write to urge you to oppose H.R. 23 (Valadao, R–CA). This bill would dramatically weaken protections for salmon, migratory birds, and other fish and wildlife in California’s Bay-Delta water-shed and would threaten thousands of fishing jobs in California and Oregon that depend on the health of these species. In addition to gutting critical federal environmental pro-tections in California, H.R. 23 also preempts a wide range of state environmental laws and would prevent the State of California from protecting and managing its own water and wildlife resources. In addition to these provi-sions focused on California, the bill also in-cludes titles that would reduce public and environmental reviews of new dams and water infrastructure across the Western states. Both the Obama Administration and the State of California opposed similar legis-lation in recent years, including opposition to H.R. 3964 (Valadao, R–CA) and H.R. 5781 (Valadao, R–CA) in 2014, and H.R. 2898 (Valadao, R–CA) in 2015. California has just emerged from a dev-astating drought, and the state is taking proactive steps to protect cities, farms, and the environment from future dry spells. However, several provisions in H.R. 23 would undermine California’s efforts by perma-nently preempting critical state laws that protect salmon and other native fisheries and the jobs they support. In addition, this legislation would effectively repeal and pre-empt state and federal laws and a binding settlement agreement that require restora-tion of the San Joaquin River and its native salmon runs, instead permanently drying up 60 miles of California’s second longest river. H.R. 23 not only preempts state law as ap-plied to federal water projects in California, but it also preempts the application of state laws to the State Water Project and vir-tually all water rights holders in California’s Bay-Delta watershed. This extensive preemp-tion of state law in H.R. 23 is contrary to over a hundred years of Reclamation law and would set a dangerous precedent for other Western states. H.R. 23 would also override the Endangered Species Act, increasing the risk that winter- run Chinook salmon and other native fish species are driven extinct. Further, H.R. 23 could devastate wildlife refuges that provide habitat for millions of birds that migrate along the Pacific Flyway by undermining the refuges’ water rights and threatening critically important funding sources. H.R. 23 would also eviscerate the 1992 Central Valley Project Improvement Act, eliminating instream flows to benefit salmon and funding for habitat restoration projects, which help to mitigate the adverse effects of the Central Valley Project. The impacts from these pro-visions would reverberate along the entire West Coast, affecting fishing jobs and related industries in Oregon and Washington that depend on salmon from California’s Central Valley and threatening populations of water-fowl and shorebirds that migrate to and from Alaska and Canada each year. In addition to these provisions focused on gutting environmental protections in Cali-fornia, H.R. 23 also includes several titles that would weaken the public’s right to know and environmental protection across the western United States. For instance, the bill’s dam permitting provisions would give the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation unprece-dented control over the environmental re-view process and could undermine the ability of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and N.O.A.A. Fisheries to share expertise and in-form the development of major infrastruc-ture investments. These provisions would make it difficult, if not impossible, for re-sponsible agencies to meaningfully analyze proposed projects and could limit the public’s ability to weigh in on infrastructure that could affect communities for decades. H.R. 23 has not been the subject of a single committee hearing to receive public input from the State of California, hunting organi-zations, sport and commercial fishermen, tribes, or conservation groups, even though the bill could greatly interfere with state water rights and cripple the ability of state and federal agencies to manage limited water resources for all beneficial uses. Last year Congress passed legislation addressing California’s water operations in the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act of 2016 (P.L. 114–322). H.R. 23 would un-dermine that legislation, which supporters claim requires that state and federal water projects are operated in compliance with state law and the Endangered Species Act. H.R. 23 also threatens thousands of fishing jobs in California, Oregon, and beyond that depend on healthy salmon runs from the Bay-Delta. The closure of the salmon fishery in 2008 and 2009 resulted in thousands of lost jobs in these states. The livelihoods and rec-reational interests of salmon fishermen, Delta farmers, fishing guides, tackle shops, bird watchers, waterfowl hunters, and com-munities across California and along the West Coast depend on the environmental protections that H.R. 23 would eliminate. For these reasons, we respectfully urge you to oppose H.R. 23. Thank you for your atten-tion.

EARHOUSE SPEAKER RYAN AND HOUSE MI-
NORITY LEADER PELOSI : I am writing to ex-press my opposition to H.R. 23, the Gaining Responsibility on Water Act of 2017. This leg-islation would exempt California from the long-standing principle that Congress should defer to the individual states in the manage-ment of their water resources. While H.R. 23 purports to affirm state authority to regu-late the waters within their borders as to other western states, the legislation singles out California by abrogating California water resource law and effectively federal-izing the State’s water resource management to the injury of the State’s fish and wildlife resources. Like its predecessors H.R. 1873 and H.R. 3964, H.R. 23 would transgress state sov-ereignty in at least three important re-spects. First, the legislation would mandate that the federal Central Valley Project (CVP) and the California State Water Project (SWP), the largest water projects in the State, operate to outdated water quality standards for the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta developed over twenty-two years ago, and would preclude state authorities from al-tering such standards notwithstanding the cumulative scientific evidence that these standards are insufficient to protect the State’s fisheries. Second, the legislation would prohibit the California State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (DFW) from exercising their state law duties to protect fishery resources and public trust values, not only as to CVP and SWP oper-ations, but as to all water right holders in California. Third, the legislation would over-turn settled principles of cooperative fed-eralism by materially altering the San Joa-quin River Restoration Settlement Act, an act that implements a settlement reached by the United States, several environmental or-ganizations, and local water users resolving a dispute over application of state fishery law to federal facilities on the San Joaquin River. California supported the compromise settlement and the implementing legislation and is a partner in the San Joaquin River Restoration Program. These proposed constraints on California’s ability to manage its natural resources con-flict with historic principles of western

water law. In California v. United States (1978) 438 U.S. 645, 654, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed California’s ability to impose state law terms and conditions on federal reclamation projects, and declared that, ‘‘[t]he history of the relationship between the Federal government and the States in the reclamation of the arid lands of the Western States is both long and involved, but through it runs the consistent thread of purposeful and continued deference to state water law by Congress.’’ California law grants the SWRCB the con-tinuing authority to review and reconsider all water rights for the purpose of deter-mining whether their exercise would violate the reasonable use requirement of the Arti-cle X, Section 2 of the California constitu-tion and California’s common law doctrine of the public trust. According to the California Supreme Court, ‘‘[t]he state has an affirma-tive duty to take the public trust into ac-count in the planning and allocation of water resources, and to protect public trust uses whenever feasible.’’ (National Audubon Society v. Superior Court (1983) 33 Ca1.3d 319, 446.) The California Legislature has adopted these principles as ‘‘the foundation of state water management policy.’’ (Cal. Wat. Code, 85023.) H.R. 23 would abrogate California’s ability to apply its water resource laws while purporting to maintain and protect the abil-ity of other western states to manage their water resources. H.R. 23 provides no expla-nation as to why California should be subject to such disparate treatment as to its sov-ereign authority to manage its natural re-sources. In addition, H.R. 23 takes these steps in violation of settled constitutional principles of state sovereignty. Relying upon separa-tion of powers principles set forth in the Tenth Amendment and elsewhere in the U.S. Constitution, the U.S. Supreme Court in New York v. United States has held that ‘‘even where Congress has the authority under the Constitution to pass laws requiring or pro-hibiting certain acts, it lacks the power di-rectly to compel the States to require or pro-hibit those acts.’’ (New York v. United States (1992) 505 U.S. 144, 166–167.) In Printz v. United States, the U.S. Supreme Court ex-panded its ruling in New York and held that ‘‘[t]oday we hold that Congress cannot cir-cumvent that prohibition by conscripting the States’ officers directly.’’ (Printz v. United States (1997) 521 U.S. 898, 935.) By compelling the SWP, a state-funded and managed water project, to operate based upon congressionally-mandated Delta water quality standards, rather than allowing Cali-fornia to develop standards that reflect the most recent scientific information regarding the Delta, H.R. 23 is ‘‘requiring’’ a state agency to comply with a federal policy. By preventing the SWRCB, the DFW, and other state agencies from taking actions to protect fishery and other public trust values, H.R. 23 is ‘‘prohibiting’’ the State from enforcing state law. These provisions of H.R. 23 violate settled state sovereignty principles. Congres-sional passage of H.R. 23 would have, in ef-fect, unconstitutionally ‘‘dragooned’’ state agencies and state officials ‘‘into admin-istering federal law.’’ (Printz, supra, 521 U.S. at p. 928.) I urge you to oppose H.R. 23. Congress can-not justify the legislation’s disparate treat-ment of California’s sovereign authority to manage its natural resources and cannot compel California to act as its regional agent to enforce congressional policy. I ask that you affirm the long-standing congres-sional tradition of cooperative federalism and dual sovereignty in water and reject H.R. 23’s attempt to federalize water re-source management in the California. Sincerely, X

OFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR , July 10, 2017. Hon. P
AULRYAN, Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. D
EAR SPEAKER RYAN: I write to oppose H.R. 23, the ‘‘Gaining Responsibility on Water Act of 2017.’’ Water defines the west and for over a cen-tury Congress and the courts have consist-ently recognized that state law determines how water is developed and used. Western states have successfully resisted any at-tempted intrusion into this essential at-tribute of their sovereignty, including in the operation or construction of water projects involving the federal government. This bill overrides California water law, ignoring our state’s prerogative to oversee our waters. Commandeering our laws for purposes de-fined in Washington is not right. It is also not smart. California is the sixth- largest economy in the world, and its future depends on the wise and equitable use of its water. Making decisions requires listening to and balancing among the needs of Califor-nia’s nearly 40 million residents and taking into consideration economics, biodiversity and wildlife resources. All of this is best done at the state and local level—not in a polarized political climate 3,000 miles away. Undermining state law is especially unwise today as California, with input from all stakeholders, is poised to make its boldest water infrastructure investments in decades: funding surface storage, updating an anti-quated delta water conveyance, and adopting water-use efficiency targets. I ask you to respect California’s rights and shelve this bill. Sincerely, E
DMUND G. B ROWN , JR. 
Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, the only winners under this bill are actually a few large agricultural producers who will take all the water, leaving none for many others. This bill is a water grab, plain and simple. The so-called GROW Act provides no new water, but it takes the existing water and gives it to those with the best lobbyists here in Washington. Instead of this highly partisan bill, we should be taking steps to actually grow the water supply for everybody, with water recycling, with water con-servation, water efficiency, many other nonideological, nonpartisan fixes, water infrastructure that can actually help deliver water to small farmers, protect our environment, and, yes, our legitimate agricultural producers as well. Unfortunately, instead, we are stuck with this so-called GROW Act, which jeopardizes fishing jobs, preempts State conservation laws, overrides the Endangered Species Act for salmon and wildlife, weakens critical safeguards under the NEPA process, and under-mines water rights. In doing so, this bill would permanently destroy Cali-fornia’s rivers, Bay-Delta Estuary, needed fisheries, and the thousands of jobs that depend on those natural re-sources. This bill is not a balanced protection. It picks winners and losers and hands over water rights to those who are present for the backroom deals in Washington. Let’s go back to the drawing board. I come from the State of Colorado, and we know how important water is. Let’s find a way to find a bipartisan path to grow the water supply across the West-ern United States. b1245 Let me address the other bill that is contained in this rule, the NDAA, Na-tional Defense Authorization Act. For 56 straight years, the United States Congress has come together to craft policies and recommendations for the United States Armed Forces and to put those policies into law under the au-thorizing statute for our military. Without question, this bill is one of the most consequential and important items that Congress undertakes each year. Personally, I have found objections to policies, and I have been a fan of other policies contained in these bills while I have been in Congress. And I want to commend the work of my col-leagues, Democratic and Republican, who serve on the Armed Services Com-mittee for their important work on this legislation so important for our national security. Many of my colleagues on the Armed Services Committee have served or do serve in our military. Members of the committee are dedicated public serv-ants, they are experts in their field, they travel and learn and hear from ex-perts, and they set aside many of their political differences to do what it takes to keep America safe and secure, some-thing that Republicans, Democrats, Independents are all committed to. We need to make sure that we give our military the tools they need to safely carry out the tasks that the Com-mander in Chief and elected officials ask them to undertake. I commend the committee for put-ting forth a bill that takes construc-tive steps in filling military readiness gaps, requiring strategies from the ad-ministration and the Department of Defense with regard to contingencies in several countries, and acknowledging and planning for the real climate change threat that is posed to our na-tional security. Yet the work of the NDAA is not lim-ited to members of the Armed Services Committee. The Members of this body as a whole, Democrats and Republicans who don’t serve on that committee, have submitted over 400 amendments to do what each one of us believes would, in some way, improve this bill and strengthen our national security. But the work of NDAA continues, and before this week is over, I expect to see the Rules Committee make in order an even greater number of these amendments. We took the first step in this rule by making a few dozen amendments in order, and we will con-tinue that work in Rules Committee this afternoon as we thoughtfully go

through the 400 amendments so a rep-resentative number of those from my Democratic and Republican colleagues who don’t have the opportunity to serve on the Armed Services Com-mittee can present those ideas for con-sideration by the full House. But for all the hard work that the Armed Services Committee has done, what we have before us this week is es-sentially an argument that needs to be solved by the Budget Committee and can’t, frankly, be solved by the author-izing committee. What we are doing is we are having a very strange debate in this body. We are having effectively a budget debate within the defense bill. We are dis-cussing authorization levels, when we know that the real discussion and bat-tle over tradeoffs will be around the funding levels, not so much the author-ization levels. One of the tricks that we worry about is by blatantly disregarding the proper use of the overseas contingency fund and by deliberately flouting limi-tations set by the Budget Control Act, this Armed Services authorization bill has been completely overtaken by the debate on the Federal budget. So this week we see a debate about the inability to pass a budget, adhere to a budget, and balance our budget, and, rather, we are operating kind of in this lala world of, if we had all the money in the world, here is what we would do, but as my Democratic and Republican friends know, we live in a world of tradeoffs, and we as Demo-crats and Republicans will need to de-cide what those tradeoffs are. That is not being done in this bill, and, in fact, it is one week less that we have to have those important discussions about how to actually secure America and protect our country. If the debate over armed services wasn’t such a serious topic, I would, frankly, give the Republicans kudos for building such an elaborate and complex budget scheme. It is very clever, more so than the traditional overseas con-tingency gimmicks that have been pre-sented within recent years. It took me a little while to even understand what this budget gimmick was, and I am going to now seek to explain it. The Defense spending budget is capped at $549 billion by the Budget Control Act of 2011. $549 billion is the maximum that would be spent on de-fense. This bill authorizes $621 billion as its discretionary base budget au-thority. That means that the bill we are debating today goes $70 billion in spending above the spending caps that Congress agreed on. That is all deficit spending. That means Congress will in-crease the deficit by $70 billion under this bill, but it gets worse. The United States has been em-broiled in conflict abroad since 2001, and many administrations, Democratic and Republican, have requested an-other pot of money that we call the overseas contingency fund. These funds, as the name indicates, are sup-posed to be used for paying costs that are incurred due to U.S. engagement in contingency operations, not baseline operations. And they are exempt, rightfully so, from the budget caps, be-cause we never wanted to constrain our ability to provide funding for an un-foreseen contingency situation that be-comes a necessity for our national se-curity. This year, however, the bill provides for $74 billion for this overseas contin-gency fund, a full $10 billion above what was even requested by the Presi-dent. Now, a reminder, the Republicans haven’t actually produced a budget this year, so we can’t exactly make a comparison between the President’s budget and the Republican majority’s budget. I think one of the reasons they might be afraid to is they will show substantially increased deficits with these tax-and-spend Republican poli-cies that have come to typify the Re-publican approach to grow our govern-ment with every new spending bill. What the NDAA does is it takes this overseas contingency account, which is often called the slush fund for the Pen-tagon, it adds $10 billion to that fund, but instead of paying for future contin-gencies, that will pay for baseline oper-ations. Some of that $10 billion goes to the unfunded priorities of the Pen-tagon, things it couldn’t quite fit in the $621 billion, which already in-creases Federal spending by $70 billion. So it is just throwing money, Federal money, your taxpayer money, Mr. Speaker, hand-over-fist, without a plan, indebting future generations for spending money today. The Pentagon gets more big ticket items they want. And, likewise, it is hard to argue with funds being allocated to oper-ations and maintenance. We are all for maintenance, we are all for readiness, but we are all for understanding the tradeoffs that we have. We cannot sim-ply continue to spend irresponsibly, indebting future generations. At some level, Mr. Speaker, and I think this kind of throwing additional money well above and beyond the budg-et caps reaches that level, we make our Nation less secure rather than more se-cure by making us economically be-holden to foreign nations and indebting future generations of Americans. Congress has set limits on how much we can spend on defense versus non-defense. So when we run out of money under this NDAA plan, either we are going to be forced to spend more, which is what you and I can predict what will happen, of course that is what is going to happen, or they are somehow going to find the money elsewhere, which I can pretty much assure you, Mr. Speaker, is not going to happen. That is a prediction that I am giving you. And not having seen a budget, by the way, this is, we think, why Republicans haven’t come up with a budget, because they know they can’t make enough devastating cuts to possibly pay for this military increase, and they cer-tainly don’t want to put their name to paper on those cuts. And we all know what is going to happen. They won’t make those cuts, spending will go up, debt will go up. I mean, that is what we know will happen. We have been here before, seen that movie. Now, again, theoretically, Draconian cuts can be made to schools and Head Start and NASA and medical research, money fighting the opioid epidemic, homeland security, police. Yeah, theo-retically they can devastate everything inside of our country, leaving a hollowed-out core, a well protected hollowed-out core, but I know Repub-licans aren’t cruel enough to do that. Instead, they are going to kick the can down the road and indebt future gen-erations and make our country less se-cure by borrowing money from China and Saudi Arabia to fund today’s mili-tary, making us economically beholden to the very foreign powers that rep-resent a real geopolitical threat to American interests. That is why budgets matter, that is why these budget gimmicks that are being used through the overseas con-tingency fund matter, and that is why we need to have a budget debate, not a fake budget debate in the context of a national defense debate, which is what is being done here today. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-self such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman referred to what this would do to the budget. I would point out to the gentleman, and I think I did this in committee yester-day, that if this is passed, it will only be 16.8 percent of total Federal outlays, which means the single most impor-tant thing that we do here in govern-ment only gets less than 20 percent of the money that we are going to spend. So I don’t think it is asking too much of ourselves, as the people responsible for providing for the defense of Amer-ica, that we spend 16.8 percent of all the Federal money we are going to spend next year on making the Amer-ican people safe and secure. He spoke about tradeoffs. Let me tell you one tradeoff I don’t think any of us should be willing to make, and that is trading off the safety and security of the American people for trying to keep some other overspending in some other part of the budget going. We need to focus today, and in this bill, on what it takes to authorize the defense and the safety and security of the American people, and I believe this bill does that, as did all but one of my colleagues on the House Armed Serv-ices Committee. So I believe that we have struck the appropriate balance here that does all that. Yes, we have got some budget things we need to take care of. That is for later. For today, we are going to focus on defending the American peo-ple. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. A

SCOTT), my colleague on the Armed Services Committee. Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gen-tleman from Alabama (Mr. B
YRNE ) for his work on the National Defense Au-thorization Act. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask my fellow Members to support the fiscal year 2018 National Defense Authoriza-tion Act. After nearly 13 hours of debate, my colleagues and I on the Armed Services Committee, we came together, we passed the legislation to provide crit-ical resources and reforms for our Na-tion’s military to undertake the 21st century threats that our country and the world faces. Part of facing these challenges is en-suring that our military personnel are able to combat the dangerous and ille-gal actions of transnational criminal organizations, particularly those close to home in the SOUTHCOM region. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gen-tleman who spoke earlier about the opioid epidemic. I would just remind my fellow Americans that over 5,000 Americans die every month from drug overdoses. Just a few months ago, I, along with the gentleman from Texas (Mr. V
EASEY ), had the opportunity to visit with the Joint Interagency Task Force South and SOUTHCOM’s headquarters in Florida to hear and see firsthand the challenges that migrant and drug interdiction within the Caribbean re-gion pose on homeland and national se-curity. Included in the fiscal year 2018 Na-tional Defense Authorization Act is a provision that I authored aimed at ad-dressing the threat these transnational criminal organizations pose on our country and seeking to find new ways to support SOUTHCOM in their con-tinuing efforts to tackle those threats head-on. To all of the members of the SOUTHCOM team, I want to thank you for the important work that you do in securing our coastlines, supporting our national security, and protecting your fellow Americans. To my colleagues, I urge your sup-port in passage of the fiscal year 2018 NDAA to keep the U.S. military the best and most prepared fighting force in the world. Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Ari-zona (Mr. G
ALLEGO ), a distinguished member of the Armed Services Com-mittee. Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Speaker, this rule is a travesty. If we vote to approve it, an amendment unanimously sup-ported by the Armed Services Com-mittee—unanimously, all Democrats and all Republicans would compromise language—to prevent President Trump from using our military’s money to build his border wall will suddenly van-ish. It is a legislative magic trick, a sneaky gimmick designed to disguise their actions. Once again, Speaker RYAN and the House Republicans are doing President Trump’s dirty work. They want to make sure that Trump can build his wall, but they are also desperate to avoid a clean up-or-down vote on this issue. They are hiding from the Amer-ican voters. They didn’t have the courage to op-pose my amendment in committee or even on the House floor. They passed this rule late at night with hardly any-one watching, in typical Republican fashion. Republicans are resorting to decep-tive legislative tactics to do Trump’s bidding just for his small, fragile ego. Mr. Speaker, this self-executing rule, if it comes to fruition, is going to at-tempt to slip one past Congress and the American people. Just 6 months into this administra-tion, it is already abundantly clear that Mexico won’t pay for Trump’s stu-pid, dumb border wall. We must not allow precious resources to be robbed from our troops simply to score polit-ical points for Trump’s ego. Mr. Speaker, with Mexico refusing to entertain this absurd policy and with-out a direct appropriation from Con-gress, President Trump is going to get desperate. His administration will in-evitably seek to pull money from other sources to make good on his promise to build this wall, including from the De-fense budget. That is why my amendment was so crucial. It would simply ensure that DOD resources aren’t siphoned off for a pointless wall that we don’t need and cannot afford. It was supported by Democrats and Republicans alike, the ranking member and the chairman. As a Member of Congress, we have a sacred responsibility to ensure that money meant to address real national security challenges isn’t diverted to combat imaginary ones that the Presi-dent has created. b1300 As a Marine Corps veteran, I believe it would be an insult to our members of the military if their resources were re-allocated to build a wall that we don’t need, that won’t bring us more secu-rity, when we have tens of thousands of military members that are currently still on food stamps while serving this country. Mr. Speaker, make no mistake: a vote for this rule is a vote to build the wall and take precious resources from the Department of Defense budget. Please vote ‘‘no.’’ The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-bers are reminded to refrain from en-gaging in personalities toward the President. Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-self such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the com-ments of my colleague from Arizona. This was not done in the middle of the night in secrecy. This was done in full committee with cameras watching us, and done early in the evening with full debate, so I disagree with him about that. Let’s talk about the wall for a sec-ond. I support President Trump and what he is trying to do with the wall. I hope we get to a point where we can deal with that. This is a defense authorization bill. This is not a wall authorization bill. The wall is already authorized. We don’t need an authorization bill for the wall. It is already there. The next step for us to take for the wall is an appro-priations bill, and this is not an appro-priations bill. So what the Rules Committee has done is made it clear that we are not going to deal with the wall one way or the other in the National Defense Au-thorization Act. That is not the proper place for it. That is not the proper place to be spending money for it. There is another part of our budget, another law for us to deal with there. So I hope that we all will understand that what we have done is made it clear there is nothing in this bill— nothing—about a wall, nor should there be anything in this bill about a wall, because that is for another com-mittee, another bill, another time, and another place. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from Wyoming (Ms. C
HE-
NEY), our newest member of the Armed Services Committee and the Rules Committee. Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank very much my colleague from both the Rules Committee and the Armed Serv-ices Committee, Mr. B
YRNE , for his work on this bill. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support both of these un-derlying bills, and I want to speak par-ticularly about the National Defense Authorization Act. We are, today, living in a world where we face a more complex array of threats than at any time in the last 70 years. The obligation that we have to our men and women in uniform, to make sure that we provide them with the resources that they need to defend this Nation, is a more solemn obliga-tion than any other we have. There are many things that we were elected to do when we came to Wash-ington, and we have done many of those things in this Congress. We have been a historically productive Congress in the months that we have been here. We have passed repeal and replace of healthcare reform, we have passed the repeal bill for Dodd-Frank, we have begun our important work on immigra-tion reform, and we have done tremen-dous work on regulatory reform to lift the burden of the massive overreach of the Obama years. But there is nothing that we do that is more important than providing the resources for our men and women in uniform. This bill is a very important first step in that direc-tion.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH5450 July 12, 2017 
I want to mention a couple of things that this bill does in particular. In the aftermath of the ICBM test, the first successful North Korean ICBM test, one of the most important chal-lenges we face as a nation is ensuring that we have provided for the defense of this Nation with respect to missile defense. This bill adds $2.5 billion above the administration’s request for missile defense. It focuses on including additional interceptors for existing systems, as well as research for new technologies. Total missile defense is still below the funding levels during the Bush ad-ministration. This bill is a very impor-tant first step, but, Mr. Speaker, we have got to do much more. We also, in this bill, begin the proc-ess of providing the necessary addi-tional resources and top line to begin to rebuild. We have not had a defense budget, Mr. Speaker, since 2011 that was based upon the Pentagon being able to assess the threats and telling us what we need to do to be able to defend against those threats. We have now, because we are living under the Budget Control Act, had a Defense Department, instead, that has been obligated to fund at levels that are arbitrary and to cut at levels that are arbitrary. No nation can respon-sibly live under that system. The next thing we have got to do is repeal the Budget Control Act. We have got to recognize that we have a huge and growing debt crisis, a huge fiscal crisis, but that crisis is not being driv-en by our defense budget. The Budget Control Act has been ineffective at get-ting at what we need to do in terms of reducing the debt. Instead, it has gut-ted our defense. We are in a world today where the North Koreans, the Iranians, the Rus-sians, the Chinese, ISIS, and al-Qaida are all continuing to make strides against us, Mr. Speaker. One of the things that I am often asked as a new Member of this body is what has surprised me most in my time in Congress. I came to this body, Mr. Speaker, as somebody who has spent a lot of time focused on national security and defense issues, as someone who spent a large part of her career really invested in and studying and learning these issues, and I thought, Mr. Speak-er, that I was relatively well informed about these issues. I have been stunned, Mr. Speaker, as a member of the House Armed Services Committee, briefing after briefing after briefing, at the extent to which we have fallen so far behind. And I think it is critically important for my col-leagues, Mr. Speaker, and for the American people to understand the ex-tent to which our adversaries are, today, fielding and developing capabili-ties and systems against which we can-not, may not be able to defend. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I want to read something that Ronald Reagan said back in 1982 on an issue when they were having similar issues and debates and discussions about defense spending. He said: ‘‘Now, I realize that many well-meaning people deplore the ex-penditure of huge sums of money for military purposes at a time of eco-nomic hardship. Similar voices were heard in the 1930s, when economic con-ditions were far worse than anything we’re experiencing today. But the re-sult of heeding those voices then was a disastrous military imbalance that tempted the forces of tyranny and evil and plunged the world into a ruinous war. . . . We must never repeat that ex-perience.’’ Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to remember that weakness is provoca-tive, that it is when we are strong that we are most able to protect ourselves and to defend ourselves, and we must learn the lessons of the past. Passing this rule and passing the underlying legislation, this National Defense Au-thorization Act, is the first step in that direction. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in the affirmative and to ensure that we do everything we can to defend our Nation and to make sure that we defend freedom for the next generation. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Cali-fornia (Mr. M
CNERNEY ). Mr. M
CNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, we are here with H.R. 23 again discussing attempts to override State and Federal environmental law. The House and Senate negotiated addi-tional pumping flexibility in last year’s WIIN Act. This group has stated for years that they just want a little additional flexibility in environmental law, which actually means weakening or eliminating environmental law. They ignore the damage this would cause to California’s delta region, its families, and its farmers. We heard last year that governments are set up for the benefit of the people, but this means all of the people, not just a few people at the expense of oth-ers. The person nominated to Deputy Sec-retary at the Department of the Inte-rior worked for Westlands Water Dis-trict just last December. He would make decisions to pump more water to Westlands, the Nation’s largest water district—a clear conflict of interest, and a clear threat to farmers and resi-dents in the delta. This is also a clear example of what is wrong with H.R. 23. It will negate en-vironmental protections; it will hurt one region to benefit another; and it al-lows corruption to seep into the Fed-eral Government. Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to op-pose H.R. 23 for these reasons. Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-self such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, in April, President Trump and congressional Republicans rolled back the FCC’s rule to protect Americans’ personal information and their internet browsing history. By doing so, they effectively sold personal privacy to the highest corporate bid-der. Today is Net Neutrality Day of Ac-tion, protesting the FCC’s proposal to end equal access to online content, which would destroy the internet as we know it. What better day to also pro-tect the future of our privacy by undoing the Republicans’ reckless roll-back that placed cable profits above our privacy and consumer protections. Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the pre-vious question, I will offer an amend-ment to the rule to bring up Represent-ative ROSEN ’s Restoring American Pri-vacy Act, H.R. 1868. This bill will re-store Americans’ privacy protections and tell internet service providers they can’t sell their customers’ personal in-formation without the knowledge and consent of the customers. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-sent to insert the text of the amend-ment in the R
ECORD , along with extra-neous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. S
CHWEIKERT ). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Colo-rado? There was no objection. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, to discuss our proposal, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. R
OSEN ). Ms. ROSEN. Mr. Speaker, if today’s vote on the previous question fails, in-stead of voting on a partisan bill that rolls back key environmental laws, overturns State law, and ignores real solutions to our water supply shortages in the West, we will have the oppor-tunity to vote on my bill, H.R. 1868, the Restoring American Privacy Act of 2017. This bipartisan legislation will re-verse the President’s decision to assign a disastrous resolution allowing inter-net providers to sell their customers’ personal information without their ac-knowledge or without their consent. As a former computer programmer and someone who has firsthand experi-ence writing code, I can tell you that the first step towards protecting vul-nerable and sensitive data is to make sure it remains private. S.J. Res. 34, which now, unfortu-nately, is the law, prevents vital online protections for millions of Americans nationwide from taking effect later this year. The resolution, signed by the President, negating FCC broadband consumer privacy rules is not only wrong and a blatant violation of pri-vacy, but it jeopardizes Americans’ personal data and puts them at risk of hacking. The October 2016 rule was the only rule that required internet service pro-viders to obtain consumers’ permission before selling their private internet browsing history and other sensitive information, including geolocation and amp usage. I am simply shocked that most of my colleagues across the aisle voted for a

measure that violates Americans’ pri-vacy by selling our most intimate and personal information, all without our consent. Repealing the FCC rule with S.J. Res. 34 now allows broadband providers to turn private personal information over to the highest bidder—or anybody they want, including the government— without a warrant and without ever telling you. That is right. Without this rule that President Trump and most Republicans in Congress blocked, internet service providers don’t need to ask for permis-sion to collect and share sensitive per-sonal information. Even worse, the pas-sage of this resolution also told pro-viders they no longer have to use rea-sonable measures to protect con-sumers’ personal data. This is absolutely unacceptable. We are living in a time where identity theft and internet hacking have be-come the new norm. Shortly after President Trump and Republicans re-pealed these consumer protections, we experienced a massive ransomware at-tack that caused major damage to businesses and companies around the world. No American wants their most personal information to be up for grabs. By using the Congressional Review Act to eliminate this rule, the FCC is now prevented from publishing rules that are substantially the same absent additional legislation, establishing a dangerous precedent for private citi-zens. Americans should have the right to decide how their internet providers use their personal information, especially since many people can’t choose their own broadband provider. What my bill does, Mr. Speaker, is simple. H.R. 1868 makes it clear that the American people’s browsing his-tories are not for sale; the American people’s personal information is not for sale; the American people’s financial information is not for sale; and the American people’s location data is not for sale. It is a very simple concept, one that I hope my colleagues across the aisle will recognize and support. The Amer-ican people don’t want the legislation that was signed into law this last spring. In overwhelming numbers, they are calling Congress and letting it be known they want to keep their private information private. I am proud to stand up for the Amer-ican people, and I hope you take up the Restoring American Privacy Act of 2017 for consideration. This is common-sense, bipartisan legislation that will reverse a misguided resolution by say-ing, once and for all, that ISPs cannot sell customers’ personal information without their knowledge and without their permission. This bill says that your privacy is not for sale, period. b1315 Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-self such time as I may consume. I appreciate the gentlewoman’s com-ments and concerns about protecting all of our privacy on the internet. I think we all should be about that. But instead of having a misguided and un-authorized regulatory action that left vast gaps in this system, we should have a comprehensive bill to deal with it. That bill is not before the House today. What is before the House today in this rule are two bills: one that deals with the drought in the West, which is very important; and the second is pro-vide for the safety and security of the American people. So that is what we are here today about. I appreciate her concerns about that. I join with her, and I hope that we have a bill on this floor that comprehen-sively deals with the issues that she brought up, but now is not the time, these are not the bills, and this is not the rule to deal with it. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Vermont (Mr. W
ELCH ). Mr. WELCH. Mr. Speaker, first of all, I want to acknowledge the good work of Chairman T
HORNBERRY and Ranking Member S
MITH in the Armed Services Committee. As my colleague from Ala-bama said, there is nothing more im-portant than having a secure national defense to protect the American peo-ple. But this bill does have problems. Many of them are not created by the Armed Services Committee. They are created by us in Congress. It has been catastrophic for us to have the millstone of the Budget Con-trol Act that is limiting the ability of Congress to make decisions about where to spend more or where to spend less, and two things are happening as a result of that. Number one, we abdicate our respon-sibility. In some places we should be spending more, but in many other places we should be spending less. The second thing, Mr. Speaker, is that we put in straitjackets our man-agers at the Pentagon and in other pro-grams because we micromanage where they must spend money. If we are going to give them a challenge—the budget cap right now is $549 billion; this bill suggests that we spend close to $700 billion—we have got to give them managerial flexibility and sta-bility. The Budget Control Act is the ‘‘Budget Paralysis Act.’’ That is on all of us here in Congress. Now, a second thing, this bill, in that context, where we are going to blow through that cap but do nothing about our ability to make decisions on the taxes and spending, means that this gets cut totally out of domestic spend-ing. In my view, General Mattis’ view is that is bad for national defense. We plus-up the Defense budget, but we take a hatchet to the State Depart-ment budget, not something that you can address in the Armed Services bill, I understand. But the effect of it, as General Mattis said: We have to buy more bullets. So this is a symptom of the problem that we have got to face squarely. The other issue in this bill is that it hasn’t given us a policy of what is our exit strategy in Afghanistan. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman from Vermont. Mr. WELCH. What is our policy? We are sleepwalking into an esca-lation. That has failed us before. We have to have that debate now. Where is the money coming from? $150 billion is just going to magically appear. No discussion about that. And this bill does not acknowledge the absolute vital importance of do-mestic and diplomatic programs to our national security. I applaud the committee and the chairman and the ranking member for some very good work they did. I criti-cize us in Congress for putting the straitjacket on them so they can’t do the job right. Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-self such time as I may consume. I strongly agree with my colleague from Vermont’s remarks regarding the Budget Control Act. It was passed for a good intention, but it has worked out quite differently from what people thought it was going to accomplish. It is time for us to take responsi-bility, as the gentleman from Vermont said, and to do what we are supposed to do to make the priority decisions about what is important for America and what is not. Providing for the safety and security of the people of America, that is important. And if we have to make cuts in other parts of our budget to make sure we are doing that, first and foremost, I am happy to do it. The gentleman is absolutely right about micromanagement. We have been micromanaging the people that we charge with defending America with how they are going to carry out com-bat responsibilities, particularly in the Middle East. President Trump, I think, quite rightly, has delegated many of those decisions down to Secretary Mattis so that our combatant com-manders can make the decisions they have got to make as and when they need to make them. I understand what he is saying about the State Department budget, some-thing that we all should be concerned about. The appropriate time to talk about that is when the appropriations bill for the State Department is here, not when we are talking about the Na-tional Defense Authorization Act. Finally, with regard to Afghanistan, which if I may make a little bit broad-er and talk about the Middle East in general, it is time for a new AUMF. The AUMFs that were passed in this Congress over 15 years ago were for a different time, with different cir-cumstances altogether. And I do sense

a bipartisan urging for us to do that, but this is not the right time for us to do it on this particular piece of legisla-tion. I hope that at a future time the For-eign Affairs Committee, that has ap-propriate jurisdiction over that issue, will come forward with an AUMF that we can all discuss because we are now not just in Afghanistan and Iraq, we are in Syria, we are in Yemen, we are in Libya, we are in Somalia, where we have had some past history that is not so good. We all—everybody, not just from the Armed Services Committee—need to understand these threats to our coun-try and what we are going to do about them, have a strategy with a clear endgame, which we need and we haven’t had for the last several years. Then we should authorize it because only Congress has the power to declare war. We should authorize it. And by au-thorizing it, we not only take responsi-bility, but we communicate to our friends and our foes alike, and to those servicemen and -women who put them-selves at risk out there that we are be-hind it. We, as the Representatives of the American people, are behind it. So I hope that we can do that, but it won’t be in this particular bill. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentle-man’s remarks, and I reserve the bal-ance of my time. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-self such time as I may consume. This bill has several other policies I want to address. For one, it ties our participation in the critical New START with Russia to a separate Eu-rope-focused treaty that Russia is not in compliance with. The New START is a nuclear arms reduction treaty between our Nation and Russia, and we should not remove ourselves from that, from an agree-ment that allows us to inspect and gather information about Russia’s nu-clear facilities. In addition, this rule, if adopted, would fail to extend the Special Sur-vivor Indemnity Allowance, causing it to expire in May of 2018. The Special Survivor Indemnity Allowance is a pro-gram that was originally created in the NDAA, and goes a long way to helping to mitigate the problems that recipi-ents of the Defense Department’s Sur-vivor Benefit Plan face. There are other provisions of this bill which I object to in their current form but are going to be debated through amendments very likely over the course of the next week. For instance, the bill currently prevents the transfer of any detainees at the Guantanamo Bay detention facility. This detention facility that is extralegal should be closed, not repopulated, and we cer-tainly will have that debate this week. This bill, unfortunately, also author-izes far too many funds and continues to overfund our nuclear weapons ac-tivities, costing taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars, in fact, as much as $1 trillion over the next 30 years, for a stockpile of weapons that, even if sub-stantially cut, would be enough to end life on the planet. I testified before the Appropriations Subcommittee with regard to this mat-ter and argued how can we possibly go before the taxpayers back home and say we need to overfund our nuclear ar-senal to destroy the world seven times instead of five, or five times instead of three. One would think that ending life on the planet once would be more than enough, and it is hard to argue from taxpayers that they should, in fact, pay for this planet’s destruction multiple times. We also continue to use force in our ongoing operations in Iraq, Syria, and elsewhere. I join my colleagues from the other side of the aisle in calling for an updated Authorization for Use of Military Force. To date, Congress has taken zero meaningful actions toward achieving that, yet we hear on this floor regularly from my friend from Alabama and others that Republicans and Democrats need to do that, espe-cially before we put another soldier in harm’s way. That is the role of this body, and it is time to stop avoiding the task of writ-ing an Authorization for Use of Mili-tary Force. Have that debate and make it happen. These are the types of questions we should be debating, but instead we are continuing to avoid those and plunging our Nation deeper into debt without a real budget plan. Instead of focusing on real questions about how to improve our defense, the general debate on this bill will largely focus on budget tricks. This debate on this budget should happen on the floor, in the Budget Committee, in a budget passed by this body. One of the amendments I offered with my colleague, Ms. L
EE, that we will be debating, would cut 1 percent of the money authorized in that bill. That would help. It would be a starting point. It would still be a spending level above the budget caps, but at least 1 percent in the record, reckless deficits from this Republican spending bill. At some point we have to make deci-sions about tradeoffs, about the direc-tions of our budgets, our entitlements, our discretionary, our revenues, our de-fense, and our nondefense. We can’t re-sign ourselves to plunging future gen-erations into further debt. My amendment with Ms. L
EEis a small, first step taking a stand against unsustainable budget levels that make our Nation less secure rather than more secure. It is the wrong way to do things. It is the wrong time to have this debate. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on this rule so we can go back to the starting board and discuss the items that my Republican col-leagues agree are important in terms of the use of the Authorization for Use of Military Force, ending the budget gim-micks, and figuring out how to balance the budget, rather than plunge our Na-tion deeper into debt. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no,’’ and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-self such time as I may consume. If I may make sure that we are all clear about where we are on the START; the START runs through 2021. That is 4 years from now. What the bill says is that if we find that Russia is in violation of the INF Treaty—and there is some indication that that is true— that we wouldn’t extend it beyond 2021. But that is 4 years from now. So what does that mean? This is a shot across the bow to Rus-sia. We are telling Russia: If you con-tinue to violate the INF Treaty, we are not going to extend with you on START. This is telling them: We are not going to let you get away with this. And I would think, at this point, after all that we have heard, we would want to stand up to Russia, and this is a very vital way to do that. Secondly, about the GTMO issue that he brought up, there are two amend-ments made in order by this rule for us to discuss GTMO, and I believe we are going to have that debate tonight. Now, I don’t agree with the amend-ments, but we made them in order so we can have that debate on this floor. So we are going to debate GTMO. My prediction is that we are going to de-feat both of those amendments, but the people on the other side of the aisle have been given a great opportunity to make their argument that we shouldn’t do that. Nukes. Why are we trying to mod-ernize our nuclear force? Because our adversaries are modern-izing theirs, and if we don’t, we are not doing the proper thing to protect the people of the United States. And then the gentleman talks about the budget bills. Now, there is a budget bill coming. Now, the budget bill is for the next fiscal year, October 1, 2017. That is several weeks from now. We have got time to pass a budget for next fiscal year. But the way we have everything set up here, we try to move these defense bills about this time of year so that we can do what we have got to do to make sure we have communicated to the military what they are going to have to do their jobs. If I may walk briefly around the world to remind us about where we are. Kim Jong-un has continued to test missiles throughout last year and this year, and he is getting better. And what he seeks is not just to strike South Korea or Japan, he wants to strike America. That is why you have an ICBM if you are in North Korea. We need to step up to the plate and do more in missile defense and more in other things to make sure we are doing everything we can to protect America from an attack from North Korea. China wants to take control of the South China Sea and the East China Sea. What does that mean to us for America?

Forty percent of the trade in the world moves through those two oceans. The greatest population center in the world is right there. It is where we want to do more business, where people there want to do more business with us; and not having a robust military presence there means we cede that part of the world to China. I guess we could pull back to where we were on December 6, 1941, when we didn’t have a presence in Guam and Japan and South Korea and Singapore. Or we could take the understanding from what happened that terrible day on December 7, 1941, that we have to be thinking now for the challenge to us then and, by making those prepara-tions and making sure we have the de-fense in place, we keep December 7, 1941, from happening again. Then we have our good friends in Russia, as they push not only into Eastern Europe, but now into the Mid-dle East. It used to be we thought that Russia was kind of off the table; you know, the Soviet Union collapsed; didn’t have to worry about Russia any-more. Russia is back. They are back in many different military ways, in their navy, in their missiles, and what they are doing with their armed forces, in-cluding the little green men in Ukraine. We need to take that threat seriously, as we haven’t had to take it for years. And then there is the Middle East. We know what is happening today in Mosul and in Raqqa. Perhaps ISIS is being pushed out of those places, but it is not disappearing. It is not going away as a threat, any more than al- Qaida has gone away as a threat. We still have terrorist groups like them and others who seek to do harm to the American people, whether it is over there or over here, and we have to pro-vide for the defense against that. Then there is Iran; Iran that, because of an ill-considered agreement reached with them by the Obama administra-tion, now is on a path to get an ICBM of its own, which it doesn’t need to strike Israel. It needs an ICBM to strike us. b1330 Then they get as close as they want to under that agreement that we reached with them. Right up to the edge of violation, where they perfect their nuclear technology, they decide in a short period of time to violate it, put a nuclear weapon on one of those ICBMs and threaten us directly. That and a host of other threats are what we are talking about in this bill. We have never faced such a complex set of threats since the end of World War II. It is not my word. It is the word of countless experts who have come be-fore our committee. We have to do this. The American people expect us to do this. Like many other people in this body, I do tele- townhalls. At my last two tele-town-halls, I have asked this open-ended question: What is the most important issue to you? We give them a broad range of issues to pick from: healthcare, tax reform, you name it. The number one issue in those two tele-townhalls, by far, for the people in my district was national security. They see what is happening in North Korea. They see what is hap-pening in the Middle East. They know what Russia is up to. They are worried about China, and they want to know what we are doing. This bill that this rule provides for does what we need to do to protect the American people. Mr. Speaker, I appre-ciate everything that I have heard today from my colleagues on both sides of the aisle because I know people on both sides of the aisle care a great deal about these issues. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 431 and the underlying bill. The material previously referred to by Mr. P
OLIS is as follows: 
ANAMENDMENT TO H. R ES. 431 O FFERED BY  M
R. POLIS At the end of the resolution, add the fol-lowing new sections: S
EC. 6. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for consider-ation of the bill (H.R. 1868) to provide that providers of broadband Internet access serv-ice shall be subject to the privacy rules adopted by the Federal Communications Commission on October 27, 2016. The first reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce. After general debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the five-minute rule. All points of order against provisions in the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consid-eration of the bill for amendment the Com-mittee shall rise and report the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amend-ments thereto to final passage without inter-vening motion except one motion to recom-mit with or without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further consideration of the bill. S
EC. 7. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the consideration of H.R. 1868. 
THEVOTE ON THE PREVIOUS QUESTION : WHAT I
TREALLY MEANS  This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. A vote against or-dering the previous question is a vote against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House should be debating. Mr. Clarence Cannon’s Precedents of the House of Representatives (VI, 308–311), de-scribes the vote on the previous question on the rule as ‘‘a motion to direct or control the consideration of the subject before the House being made by the Member in charge.’’ To defeat the previous question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the subject be-fore the House. Cannon cites the Speaker’s ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ‘‘the refusal of the House to sustain the de-mand for the previous question passes the control of the resolution to the opposition’’ in order to offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the majority party of-fered a rule resolution. The House defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R–Illinois) said: ‘‘The previous question having been refused, the gentleman from New York, Mr. Fitz-gerald, who had asked the gentleman to yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first recognition.’’ The Republican majority may say ‘‘the vote on the previous question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no substantive legislative or policy im-plications whatsoever.’’ But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the Repub-lican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in the United States House of Rep-resentatives, (6th edition, page 135). Here’s how the Republicans describe the previous question vote in their own manual: ‘‘Al-though it is generally not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member con-trolling the time will not yield for the pur-pose of offering an amendment, the same re-sult may be achieved by voting down the pre-vious question on the rule....  When the motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering the pre-vious question. That Member, because he then controls the time, may offer an amend-ment to the rule, or yield for the purpose of amendment.’’ In Deschler’s Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, the subchapter titled ‘‘Amending Special Rules’’ states: ‘‘a refusal to order the previous question on such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on Rules] opens the resolution to amend-ment and further debate.’’ (Chapter 21, sec-tion 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: ‘‘Upon re-jection of the motion for the previous ques-tion on a resolution reported from the Com-mittee on Rules, control shifts to the Mem-ber leading the opposition to the previous question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who controls the time for de-bate thereon.’’ Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does have substantive policy impli-cations. It is one of the only available tools for those who oppose the Republican major-ity’s agenda and allows those with alter-native views the opportunity to offer an al-ternative plan. Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the res-olution. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. J
ODYB. H ICEof Georgia). The question is on ordering the previous question. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-ceedings on this question will be post-poned.

GENERAL LEAVE  
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and in-sert extraneous material in the R
ECORD  on the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Oregon? There was no objection. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2430, the FDA Reauthorization Act—FDARA—of 2017. While it may not be headline news, for almost a year now, the Energy and Commerce Committee has been work-ing in a bipartisan fashion on this crit-ical legislation which will build on the landmark 21st Century Cures Act. The FDARA will ensure that innovative and lower cost treatments, as well as lifesaving medical technologies, reach patients sooner. Last month we reported this bill out of committee on a 54–0 vote. Unani-mously, Mr. Speaker. For starters, the FDARA updates and reauthorizes four user fee programs at the Food and Drug Administration. Though they sound like just another set of wonky Washington acronyms, the UFAs, as they are called—user fee agreements—are absolutely critical to the Food and Drug Administration’s timely and consistent review of brand and generic drugs, biosimilars, and medical devices. They also maintain the agency’s gold standard of patient safety. Before the generic drug user fee pro-gram was established 5 years ago, there were literally thousands of applica-tions pending at that agency—thou-sands. Significant strides have been made to clear that backlog, and the FDARA will build on that progress so that generics come to market as soon as safely possible. Make no doubt about it, this bill will increase competition and it will provide lower cost alter-native medications to patients. Through a series of hearings and markups at the Energy and Commerce Committee, Members on both sides of the aisle proposed a number of addi-tional provisions to improve the proc-esses at the FDA and to strengthen this legislation in ways that will ben-efit patients, medical product manu-facturers, and the agency itself. For example, my colleague from Or-egon (Mr. SCHRADER ), who I know is on the floor, partnered with the gen-tleman from Florida (Mr. B
ILIRAKIS ) on meaningful ways to incentivize generic entry into markets where competition was lacking and patients were being exploited by bad actors. I thank them for their work on this effort. Their work will save patients money, and their work will get new products into the market sooner. In addition, there are a number of improvements to the regulation of var-ious medical technologies that will ex-pand access, that will streamline bu-reaucratic processes, and that will lower costs. Further, this legislation includes provisions that have been championed by Republicans and Democrats alike in both Chambers throughout their dis-cussions on the user fee agreements, including a range of improvements to the pediatric drug and device develop-ment process, and guidance on ways to expand patient access to clinical trials.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH5478 July 12, 2017 
Finally, this legislation includes a revised version of the RACE for Chil-dren Act that Representatives M
CCAUL, M
ULLIN , and B UTTERFIELD have worked tirelessly on for quite some time. H.R. 2430 is the product of significant bipartisan and bicameral discussions with a wide range of stakeholders that went throughout regular order at the committee after a series of substantive hearings and then received a unani-mous vote. Which, Mr. Speaker, is probably why nobody will ever read about this or see it on television, be-cause we actually worked together and did it in a bipartisan way and achieved the unanimous vote that will bring drugs and devices to patients quicker, sooner, and safer in the long run. This legislation is yet another exam-ple of Congress getting good things done. We are working together. And it is important to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their work on this legislation, particularly full committee Ranking Member P
ALLONE , Health Subcommittee Ranking Mem-ber G
REEN , Health Subcommittee Chairman B
URGESS . This bipartisan work has produced a big win for pa-tients. The FDARA will help bring lower- cost generic drug alternatives and biosimilars to market faster, increas-ing competition, lowering drug costs. It will streamline the process for re-viewing or approving new treatments and cures for patients, ultimately de-livering new and innovative therapies, drugs, and devices to patients more quickly. Finally, this bill is a big win for the millions of Americans working in the healthcare sector and the drug and de-vice manufacturers that help us live better and healthier lives. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’ I want my colleagues and all Americans to know this is just step one in a long-term effort in our com-mittee to help patients get access to better medicines and lower costs. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2430, the FDA Reauthorization Act, a bill that would allow the FDA to con-tinue its critical mission of reviewing and approving drugs and medical de-vices that save lives and improve the quality of life for many Americans. The legislation before us today is the product of compromise and almost 2 years of work between FDA, Congress, industry, and other stakeholders. The FDA Reauthorization Act reauthorizes FDA’s medical product user fee agree-ments, providing FDA with the re-sources the agency needs to continue its critical public health work and hire the necessary scientists and review staff, and improve the certainty and ef-ficiency of the drug review process. The sixth reauthorization of the Pre-scription Drug User Fee Act will main-tain current review timelines, mod-ernize the user fee structure, and build on the work of 21st Century Cures Act by investing resources in the develop-ment of biomarkers and innovative clinical trial designs. The fourth reauthorization of the Medical Device User Fee Amendments includes some important new policies that will help to increase the consist-ency, efficiency, and effectiveness of drug and medical device reviews. The bill advances the use of the pa-tient perspective and the risk-benefit assessment of medical devices. It es-tablishes a system utilizing real world data for pre-market approval of new uses and post-market safety moni-toring, and it improves presubmission communication with manufacturers in an effort to expedite the review proc-ess. This legislation also reauthorizes two of our newer user fee programs for generics and biosimilars. Both of these programs strive to expedite access to high-quality, lower-cost drugs for American families. The FDARA will also allow the agen-cy to undertake new initiatives to cre-ate a category of over-the-counter hearing aids, advance the development of pediatric cancer treatments, and provide greater assistance and incen-tives to encourage additional competi-tion for generic drugs. Since this is a bipartisan com-promise—and I want to stress that—as my colleague Mr. W
ALDEN said, it real-ly is important and people should take note that this is a major piece of legis-lation that is being done on a bipar-tisan basis by our committee. But it does not address every issue that I would have liked. It also includes trou-blesome language prohibiting the FDA from making the investments the agen-cy needs as part of future user fee agreements. It is important that the FDA maintain a work environment that allows the agency to recruit and retain the world’s best and brightest. I am concerned that this final agreement preserves language advanced in the Senate bill that will make it difficult in the future for the FDA to make the investments needed to recruit per-sonnel and meet performance goals set out in the user fee reauthorizations. This is a concern, again, that was put in by the Senate that I hope we can ad-dress in the future. But I do want to stress, at the end of the day, that this final product represents all of the sig-nificant discussions and compromises that were made, and, of course, the leg-islation that is going to be effective is the result of compromise. I am pleased that we are considering this in a very timely fashion, because, as I mentioned, we don’t want the per-sonnel who work at the FDA to be af-fected; and if we do this in a timely fashion, they won’t have to worry about pink slips or their jobs. Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my col-leagues to support H.R. 2430 so that we can continue to give the FDA the tools and resources it needs to continue doing the critical work of reviewing and improving lifesaving drugs and medical devices. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from New Jersey for his good work and kind comments on our legislation that we put together. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BARTON ), the former chairman of the full com-mittee. (Mr. BARTON asked and was given permission to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. BARTON. Mr. Speaker, I com-mend Chairman W
ALDEN and Ranking Member P
ALLONE , along with sub-committee Chairman B
URGESS and sub-committee Ranking Member G
REEN for their excellent leadership on this piece of legislation. If you look at the front page of The Washington Post this morning, you will see on the left-hand column the story about a miracle living drug to help cure cancer in children that have leukemia. In the legislation before us, as the chairman just pointed out, there is the RACE for Children Act, which was in-troduced by Congressmen M
CCAUL, B
UTTERFIELD , and M ULLIN , and which I am a original cosponsor, that will make it possible to help children soon-er. This particular drug that is discussed on the front page of The Washington Post took decades to develop and has just now been approved. How many thousands of children have died while that drug was being de-veloped? The legislation before us includes, as I said, the RACE for Children Act, which will make it possible to bring these innovative drugs to market much more quickly. Mr. Speaker, I commend all the lead-ers and the members of the committee for this bipartisan piece of legislation, as Mr. P
ALLONE has just pointed out. I am proud to vote for it, and I encour-age all Members of the House to do the same. b1345 Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. G
ENEGREEN ), the ranking member of the Health Subcommittee. Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2430, the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017. For many months, we have worked on a bipartisan basis to negotiate and prepare for the four FDA user fee agreements for reauthorization, across party lines, and you are seeing that. That is why I am proud to be a member of the Energy and Commerce Com-mittee. We will fight when we have to, but we also can work together on things that are really important to our country.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H5479 July 12, 2017 
These programs must be reauthorized in a timely manner to avoid a melt-down of the medical product develop-ment pipeline. We have had great col-laboration and strong bipartisan work-ing relationships throughout the proc-ess, from the publication of the goals letters, to the hearings, and the mark-ups in the Health Subcommittee, all the way through the unanimous vote out of the Energy and Commerce Com-mittee last month. Since the first PDUFA was estab-lished in 1992, Congress has created ad-ditional user fee programs for medical devices, generic drugs, and biosimilars. In this cycle, we see shortened review timelines and have given the FDA new tools to harness the latest science and streamline the review process. FDARA would build on previous suc-cess by reauthorizing the user fees and make improvements in the review process like advancing the use of bio-markers and patient experience data. The bill includes additional provisions beyond the underlying agreements that are worthy of support. To give some examples, it will pro-mote generic drug development and competition, establish a category of over-the-counter hearing aids, crack down on counterfeit drugs, and foster innovation in medical imaging. FDA approval is the global gold standard and reauthorizing the user fee programs will ensure the agency has the resources—particularly capable, qualified staffers—to fulfill this mis-sion. I look forward to working with my colleagues to establish a user fee pro-gram for over-the-counter products and reform the monograph systems once we have reauthorized the existing user fee programs that will soon expire. I want to thank Ranking Member P
ALLONE , Chairman W ALDEN , and the chair of the Health Subcommittee, Congressman B
URGESS , for their work and commitment into timely user fee reauthorization. I also want to thank the staff, Kim Trzeciak and John Stone, and my own staff, Kristen O’Neill, for the countless hours of work they did to get us to this place. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2430. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. B
URGESS ), chairman of the Sub-committee on Health. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding me the time. It is significant today to be here and be supporting H.R. 2430, the Food and Drug Administration Reauthorization Act of 2017. The passage of this bill provides cer-tainly the security to the scientists who are working even now in pursuit of better cures and, of course, hope for pa-tients across the country who are awaiting better treatments of the dis-eases that are afflicting them. By reauthorizing the Food and Drug Administration user fee program, we are ensuring that the Food and Drug Administration can continue to offi-cially operate and approve new drugs for the market. Upon becoming chairman of the Sub-committee on Health this year, I had the privilege of convening four sepa-rate legislative hearings on the policies that are included in H.R. 2430. In each of those hearings, we heard about the tremendous success of the user fee pro-grams in expanding access to afford-able medications, supporting bio-medical innovation, and maintaining high standards at the FDA for safety, efficacy, and quality. H.R. 2430 will build upon these suc-cesses and will also build upon the achievements that we achieved in the last Congress, in the 21st Century Cures Act. And now we can ensure that the FDA has resources necessary to get medical treatments and cures to pa-tients and healthcare providers as quickly as possible. This bill is an important step forward for our committee and for this Con-gress, and we continue to pursue mean-ingful improvements to the healthcare system. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman WAL-
DEN, Ranking Member G ENE GREEN , Ranking Member P
ALLONE of the full committee, all members of the Energy and Commerce Committee, both sub-committee and full committee, who worked hard to improve the substance of this bill as it came through. Clearly, I wish to thank the majority and minority staffs who worked so hard to bring this to fruition. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. S
CHAKOWSKY ). Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation, and I, too, want to thank all of the Mem-bers and staff who were engaged in pre-paring this bill for a vote on the floor of the House. I wanted to focus on two of the amendments that are included in the bill—I am grateful for that—that I sponsored. First, it includes my amendment to create a pilot project to evaluate postmarket safety of medical devices. It also includes my amendment which states that Congress and Federal agen-cies need to work together to lower drug prices. Everyone has been im-pacted by rising costs of prescription drugs, which is why 60 percent of Americans believe addressing the cost of prescription drugs needs to be a top priority. The drug pricing crisis cannot be at-tributed to a single bad actor or a few blockbuster drugs. A recent study found that 97 percent of widely used brand name drugs had a price increase that exceeded inflation. This crisis requires a comprehensive solution that increases transparency; lowers prices for patients, Medicare, and Medicaid; and ensures that every American can get access to the drugs that they need. It is time for Congress to get serious about lowering the cost of drugs for Americans, and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Michi-gan (Mr. UPTON ), the former chairman of the committee, and the leader of the 21st Century Cures Act legislation. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, so this is a jobs bill. And those who know me know that I have a long record of supporting innovation when it comes to research and development of new drugs and de-vices. That is why I was proud to help au-thor the 21st Century Cures Act with my Democratic colleague D
IANA D
EGETTE . This bill broke down the bar-riers for research and development, put a greater focus on patient-centered care, and gave billions in resources to the National Institutes of Health. President Obama signed our bill into law at the end of 2016. It marked a truly great victory for both patients and researchers across the country. And now that Cures is law, we have got to make sure that the FDA is able to handle the new breakthrough treat-ments in a timely and predictable fash-ion, all while still maintaining the highest levels of patient safety. That is why this agreement is so important. My district in southwest Michigan has literally thousands of jobs on the line that are affected by this legisla-tion, and whether it is on the drug side at Pfizer, or the device side at Stryker, or the generic side at Perrigo—all in my district—passing this legislation is vital to those good-paying local jobs, as well as to the patients who will ben-efit from the new therapies that get those products to market. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. B
UTTERFIELD ). Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding time and for his leadership on the com-mittee. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2430, the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017, which reauthorizes the FDA’s user fee programs that are crit-ical to drug development, the medical device approval process, and, most im-portantly, to the patients who will ben-efit from these advances. While I support this critical bill over-all, I want to highlight, in particular, sections 503 through 505, which is the RACE for Children Act that my friend M
IKE MCCAUL, Congressman M IKE M
CCAUL, and I introduced earlier this year. Scientific advances have shown that some childhood and adult cancers share the same molecular targets. RACE, Mr. Speaker, will help facili-tate the expeditious development of in-novative and promising treatments for children living with cancer by pro-viding the FDA new authority to re-quire a pediatric investigation into an adult cancer drug if that drug uses mo-lecular targeting and is relevant to the cancer.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH5480 July 12, 2017 
I am grateful to Mr. W ALDEN and Ranking Member P
ALLONE and their respective staffs for understanding the urgent need to enact the RACE for Children Act and for working with me, working with my staff, to see that it was included. I would also like to highlight section 701 and 702, which is the text of a bill I introduced with Dr. B
UCSHON to mod-ernize and streamline FDA’s medical device inspection process by moving to a risk-based inspection approach. The provision will allow FDA to better use its limited resources and improve pa-tient safety by focusing on facilities that have the most potential to impact public health. Finally, passage of the FDA Reau-thorization Act of 2017 will send a strong signal to the administration that Congress values the critical im-portance of medical research and pa-tient safety. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. L
ANCE ), a very important member of our committee. Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, I congratu-late the chairman, the ranking member of the full committee, and the chair-man and the ranking member of the subcommittee for this important work. I rise in strong support of the Food and Drug Administration Reauthoriza-tion Act. We need a strong FDA to make sure lifesaving medicines reach the market and that patients have the peace of mind of a safe regulatory proc-ess. This bill ensures the wheels of cre-ation keep turning, and in no part of our Nation is this more important than New Jersey, one of the medicine chests of the world. It means that patients here in the United States and hundreds of millions around the world have benefited from the genius of our biopharmaceutical and life science industries. Patient safety is always the critical priority, and I am pleased this legislation in-cludes language I authored to crack down on counterfeit drugs that are flooding into the United States. Too many Americans are falling victim to knockoffs that have infiltrated the U.S. supply chain, and this legislation significantly changes that. Disease knows no bounds and, one way or another, each of us is affected by disease. This work makes a dif-ference in patients’ lives and makes sure the system from idea to pharmacy is working. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to support this product. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentlewoman from Colorado (Ms. D
EGETTE ). Ms. D
EGETTE. Mr. Speaker, at a time of hyperpartisanship when tradi-tions of consensus are seldom upheld, I am pleased to see Congress continue its tradition of passing FDA user fee reau-thorization with broad bipartisan sup-port. It is absolutely critical that the FDA continue to promote medical innova-tion and support public health. To do so, it must have consistent funding, which this bill helps assure. I am also so proud that this bill builds directly on the 21st Century Cures Act, which I coauthored with Representative FRED U
PTON . Consistent with Cures, the bill before us today ensures that both the pa-tient’s voice and evidence from clinical practice can be considered during drug development when it is appropriate. It also helps establish a process for the FDA to qualify so-called biomarkers, which will facilitate the development of future cutting-edge therapies. By reinforcing these key provisions of the 21st Century Cures Act, I am fully confident that the bill will help deliver on our bipartisan promise to jump-start treatments for families and for patients with unmet needs. Mr. Speaker, I also want to thank Chairman W
ALDEN and Ranking Mem-ber P
ALLONE for incorporating provi-sions into the bill that will deepen our understanding of the psychosocial im-pact of disease. These provisions are based on the bipartisan Patient Experi-ence in Research Act which Represent-ative L
ANCE and I coauthored. As more is learned about the social and emotional effects of disease, we can deliver better outcomes for pa-tients by improving medication adher-ence, tailoring treatment regimens, and enhancing participation in clinical trials. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. B
ILIRAKIS ), a very important member of our committee. Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge the passage of the FDA Reauthorization Act. With this legisla-tion, we can modernize the FDA and reduce the barriers to innovation and competition. If America is going to lead the world in biomedical innovation, we need an FDA that can efficiently review and approve new drugs. The FDA must act with the same urgency that patients feel waiting for cures. Importantly, this bill includes a bi-partisan provision that I authored with my colleague K
URTSCHRADER . b1400 The provision uses free market poli-cies to help spur the development of new generic drugs, increase competi-tion, and combat high drug prices. I am also pleased we are including in the RACE for Children Act an impor-tant provision to advance pediatric cancer research and development. With today’s bill, we have an oppor-tunity to truly make a difference for our families, our friends, our neigh-bors, and the millions of Americans liv-ing with a deadly disease. Let’s get this done. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Vermont (Mr. W
ELCH ). Mr. WELCH. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of our committee, our ranking member, Dr. BURGESS , and Mr. G
REEN . Facilitating the approval of these drugs, having the FDA work in a safe and constructive way, and having a quicker turnaround time is all really good. It is really important. I thank them for their leadership. This is some-thing that had to be done. It is going to benefit everyone. I want to talk about another issue that we didn’t address but we did de-bate, and that is the high cost of pre-scription drugs. In this legislation, on the one hand, we are accommodating a reasonable re-quest by the pharmaceutical industry for a fast and efficient approval proc-ess; but on the other hand, we are de-nying any relief to consumers who are getting absolutely hammered day in and day out with unjustified price in-creases because of the pricing power of the pharmaceutical industry. Yes, they do do good things, life-ex-tending and pain-relieving drugs, but that doesn’t justify grinding consumers into the dust who can’t afford the cost of these prescriptions, where it is just within reach that they can provide re-lief to their family. We know how much pharmaceutical prices have been going up. It is hurting our employers, who are working hard to provide good healthcare to their em-ployees. It is hurting taxpayers. But every single one of us has met a constituent like a mom who is strug-gling with this choice of trying to af-ford something she can’t afford or risk a loss she would never endure. I am talking about the EpiPen; $600 to get an EpiPen here in the United States. Mylan makes that. They are a Neth-erlands-based company now. They moved over there for tax reasons. In the Netherlands, you can get it for $100. This isn’t justified. The chairman, the ranking member, and I know this. When E
LIJAH CUMMINGS and I met with President Trump, he knows it. He talked about the rip-off pricing. He talked about the possibility of impor-tation of safe drugs from Canada as a way of getting some price pressure on these companies. We have got the committee that can address this. I would like us to do that. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. B
UCSHON ). Mr. BUCSHON. Mr. Speaker, the FDA Reauthorization Act we are con-sidering today provides the FDA the resources it needs to ensure innovative and lifesaving drugs and medical de-vices are brought to the market in a safe and expedient manner, while pro-viding transparency and certainty to manufacturers. Further, the device inspection and regulatory improvements title reflects language I introduced with Representa-tives B
ROOKS , P ETERS , and B
UTTERFIELD , which sets forth a risk- based approach to medical device es-tablishment inspections and improves predictability for scheduled inspec-tions, among other provisions.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H5481 July 12, 2017 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. I look forward to moving it through Congress and sending it to the President’s desk. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. S
CHRADER ). Mr. SCHRADER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the FDA Reauthor-ization Act, FDARA as it is called. It could not be more evident that the time has come for Congress to reckon with the growing problem of exorbitant drug prices. Every few months sees the headlines about another extreme price hike, as was just mentioned. Some un-scrupulous pharmaceutical CEO buys the rights to produce drugs that have been on the market for decades, usu-ally where there are no competitors, then, seemingly overnight, they raise the price astronomically. In the case of Daraprim, a drug that is used by some transplant patients and people living with AIDS, the price went from $13.50 per pill to $750. That is outrageous, a price increase of 5,000 percent. For this drug and many oth-ers, the drugs have been off patent for ages and there is no generic competitor on the market. Competition from generic drugs saves patients and the government billions of dollars on a weekly basis. Unfortu-nately, generic drug manufacturers who want to bring these markets to competition face a long approval proc-ess, steep costs, and uncertainty. This FDA act reckons with that. It is time for Congress to act, also, on those unscrupulous providers. G
US B
ILIRAKIS and I introduced a bill pro-viding competition to drive down those costs. We provide new incentives for generic drugs to come to market and reform the process. I am in support of the bill. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I want to commend my colleague from Oregon for his good work on this part of the bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. M
ULLIN ). Mr. MULLIN. Mr. Speaker, this spring in my district in Oklahoma, the McAlpin family of Tahlequah lost their 2-year-old son, Kai, to pediatric cancer. Kai’s parents refer to Kai as Warrior Kai because he fought cancer every day with courage and dedication like a true warrior. Included in H.R. 2430 today is the RACE for Children Act, which aims to create new and better pediatric treatment options for warriors like Kai. Currently, there are over 900 drugs in development to treat cancer in adults, while only a handful of drugs are being developed to fight cancer in children. Clearly, those statistics show that the law has not kept up with scientific in-novation. RACE can help deliver lifesaving treatments for pediatric cancer pa-tients by updating the Pediatric Re-search Act. This bill requires all drug manufacturers to test a new drug in a pediatric population before applying it to children during cancer treatment. RACE for Children puts safety first and ensures that researchers use scientific evidence when declaring effectiveness of a drug before providing it to pa-tients. I am glad to see the RACE for Chil-dren Act included today, and I thank Chairman MCCAUL and Congressman B
UTTERFIELD for their work on the bill. The fight of Warrior Kai continues with us. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. K
ENNEDY ). Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman W
ALDEN , Ranking Member P
ALLONE , Ranking Member G REEN , and Subcommittee Chairman B
URGESS for their leadership in uniting our col-leagues across the aisle on a bill that supports patients and the life sciences industry. This user fee bill is a testa-ment to what can be achieved when we debate policies in the open and con-front challenges together. I would also like to specifically focus on one piece of the legislation, the Over-the-Counter Hearing Aid Act of 2017. A few weeks ago, a friend of mine wrote to me and shared her story of hearing loss. A 34-year-old lawyer, it nearly derailed her career by leaving her unable to argue cases in the court-room. She continued by outlining the often overlooked side effects brought about by hearing loss—isolation, anx-iety, depression, and memory loss—all compounded by prohibitive costs for hearing aids that aren’t covered by Medicare or most private insurers. Faced with prices upwards of $5,000, many Americans are denied the relief and the treatment that they deserve. With this bipartisan bill, we will not only spark innovation and competi-tion, we will help our constituents in their communities, offices, factory floors, and even their own homes. I hope my colleagues will support this bill. I want to thank Representative B
LACKBURN for her tireless work in get-ting it across the finish line as well. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Michi-gan (Mr. W
ALBERG ). Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the FDA Re-authorization Act, and I want to thank Chairman W
ALDEN and the other bipar-tisan leadership on the committee for bringing this bipartisan bill to the floor today. As science and technology advances at a rapid rate, the potential for break-throughs to treat and cure some of the worst diseases are truly within our reach; yet all too often, our laws and regulations are stuck in the past. That is why reauthorizing the Food and Drug Administration’s user fee pro-grams is so important. This bipartisan bill builds off the im-portant work we accomplished through the 21st Century Cures Act. It will help speed up the approval process for life-saving drugs, foster greater competi-tion, and bring down costs for patients. It will also help ensure America re-mains on the forefront of medical inno-vation and that good-paying jobs in the medical device industry remain here at home. I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill, and together we can offer a healthier future for our pa-tients. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. C
A´RDENAS ). Mr. CA´RDENAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of H.R. 2430, the FDA Reauthorization Act. I also would like to thank the chair-man and ranking member of the En-ergy and Commerce Committee for working so hard to get this important bill on the floor here today. This reauthorization bill provides the FDA with the resources to complete an important and difficult job: ensuring timely and efficient drug review proc-esses while maintaining rigorous sci-entific and safety standards to main-tain the safety, efficacy, and security of drugs, biological products, medical devices, and therapies that Americans have access to today and tomorrow. I am lucky to have been born and raised in this great country where we have access to the latest innovation in the life sciences sector. I wish my par-ents had been raised right here in this great, wonderful country so they may still be here today, so that they could enjoy time with their grandchildren if I have been so blessed to do so myself. The FDA is seen as the gold standard around the world, and this bill keeps us right there, right at the top. I am encouraged to see my colleagues working together to ensure that the FDA is able to continue to fulfill this responsibility, and I look forward to continue working to have this reau-thorization passed out of Congress. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Penn-sylvania (Mr. C
OSTELLO ), who is from the Philadelphia suburbs and is an im-portant member of our committee. Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the FDA Reauthorization Act, which is very important to our country and to Pennsylvania’s Sixth Congressional District. Many communities in my district are at the forefront of innovation in the life sciences industry, and this legisla-tion will make sure our businesses re-main competitive and on pace with public health needs. This bill is critical to allowing us to continue our bipartisan work to reduce drug costs, to advance therapies that can save lives, and to develop safe and innovative treatments for patients and their families. Finally, Mr. Speaker, it is important the public is aware that this is a bipar-tisan bill. There are some things that perhaps some Republicans would have liked to have seen in this bill that

didn’t make their way in, and there are some things that perhaps some Demo-crats would have liked to have seen make their way into this bill that didn’t. We found consensus and we worked together. It was a unanimous vote out of the Energy and Commerce Committee. I am proud to stand behind that, and this is a good day for Amer-ica. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. D
INGELL ). Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2430, the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017. We all have loved ones, friends, and neighbors who are suffering from life- threatening diseases and illnesses and who want hope that that next genera-tion treatment or therapy will still be available to them. It is our shared responsibility to sup-port the FDA as well as countless re-searchers and patient advocates across the country who are working to bring new cures to market. This critical, bi-partisan legislation helps us achieve that important goal by reauthorizing user fee programs at FDA for 5 years. I want to thank Chairman W
ALDEN , Ranking Member P
ALLONE , Chairman B
URGESS , and Ranking Member G REEN  for continuing the longstanding tradi-tion on the Energy and Commerce Committee of advancing this legisla-tion in a bipartisan manner. Our work together on this bill should be a model for how we can cooperate on other issues in the future, and it is good that we are passing this bill on the House floor well in advance of the September 30 deadline. I also want to thank the committee for including provisions that I worked on with Mr. L
ANCE , Dr. B URGESS , and Mr. G
REEN to enhance penalties for counterfeit and diverted drugs, and for including Mr. K
ENNEDY ’s over-the- counter hearing aid bill, which will go a long way to providing real relief to the 30 million Americans who suffer from hearing loss. Hearing loss is a quality-of-life issue, plain and simple, and passage of to-day’s legislation will help many re-ceive the treatment that they need in a quick manner, while also ensuring safe-ty. It is a good bill that deserves our support. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. C
ARTER ), who is the resident phar-macist on the committee. Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-er, I rise today to speak in support of H.R. 2430, the FDA Reauthorization Act, because of its importance to our healthcare system and the millions of people who depend on it. The FDA Re-authorization Act is essential as we seek reforms to the way we develop new drugs and therapies and the ways in which we are able to get those to market. Under this legislation, we are streamlining the approval process to maintain the provisions that make our market, while making changes to en-sure new therapies aren’t unnecessarily held up. b1415 We have set benchmarks for reviews to ensure that the drug approval proc-ess is moving along and doesn’t get bogged down by bureaucratic red tape. And most importantly, we are pro-viding patients with a chance to pursue new and innovative drugs that can really make a difference in their life. We have seen progress in the ap-proval of rare disease drugs, helping millions who suffer from diseases that often have no treatment. With this bill, we can provide them with new opportu-nities. Additionally, we will be able to see more generics entering the market, in-creasing competition and driving down costs for consumers. I applaud Chairman WALDEN , Chair-man B
URGESS , and all of my colleagues on the committee for helping to get this essential legislation to the finish line. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. M
CCAUL), chairman of the Home-land Security Committee and one of the authors of a portion of this bill that is really important for kids. Mr. M
CCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman W
ALDEN for including my bill, the Research to Accelerate Cures and Equity, or RACE, for Children Act, in this FDA reauthorization. I intro-duced the bill with my colleague, Mr. B
UTTERFIELD , to strengthen the FDA’s ability to require pediatric studies of cancer drugs during development. Despite current programs in place to require similar studies, they have never been undertaken for cancer drugs. This bill will require a study into any cancer drug that uses ‘‘molec-ular targeting,’’ which attacks specific cancer cells rather than the part of the body where the cancer resides. By re-quiring these studies, doctors can de-termine whether a drug is safe and ef-fective in children and, ultimately, provide accurate labeling for pediatric use. I founded the Childhood Cancer Cau-cus when I first entered Congress to give a voice to the 15,000 children diag-nosed with cancer every year and the hundreds of thousands of survivors who face a lifetime of medical challenges. Passing this bill will provide these children access to the treatments they deserve. I thank all those involved for their tireless work in bringing this bill to the House floor. As my good friend, lit-tle Sadie Keller, who is battling leu-kemia as I speak, once said: ‘‘Together, we can make a difference.’’ To Sadie and all the children who are in the fight of their lives, I want you to know that today we are making a dif-ference. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. BIGGS), a passionate advocate for those who really need access to medi-cations at the end stage of their lives. Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for bringing this bill forward and also for granting me time to speak on an issue that I am passionate about, which is Right to Try. I support the underlying bill and hope that we have a chance, soon, to consider the Right to Try bill, which has been worked on by myself, Senator J
OHNSON , and Representative F
ITZPATRICK . As many know, Right to Try would allow terminally ill patients who have no other options left to receive drugs that have passed the Food and Drug Administration’s basic safety testing but which have not been fully ap-proved. In 2014, my home State of Arizona passed a similar Right to Try law with nearly 80 percent of the vote, due in large part to the heroic efforts of my late friend, Laura Knaperek, who was battling incurable cancer at the time. Today, nearly 40 States have enacted Right to Try legislation. This is a bi-partisan cause and one that has re-ceived strong support from the White House. I look forward to continuing to work with the chairman to find a path forward for Right to Try. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, as I said before, I am very proud of the fact that this bill is bipartisan, continuing a tradition of dealing with these FDA user fee and authorization bills on a bipartisan basis. We worked long and hard to get this accomplished in a timely fashion, in particular, so that the personnel at the FDA are not threatened in any way. I am very hopeful that this will pass today, go over to the Senate and also pass there quickly, and be signed by the President soon. Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I encourage my col-leagues to support this legislation. As I have said, it is a bipartisan bill. I think even more importantly than that, Mr. Speaker, this legislation will save lives. It will bring about quicker cures for those who need new medicines and medical devices. This is the finest work that we can do in this body, working with those sci-entists and innovators in helping de-velop a system where they can get ap-provals and get new medicines to mar-ket that are safe and that will save lives. We are doing that today. I want to thank the staff, who have been incredibly important in this effort and my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who worked together. We didn’t get everything everybody wanted in this bill, but we got a bill that passed unanimously out of our committee and that I believe the Senate will take up

and adopt, as well, and we can move forward in such a positive direction for people that you heard about today from my colleagues. Lives that are on the line can be saved by innovation. The quicker we get that innovation to the market, the more we can reduce costs and save lives. Mr. Speaker, I call on my colleagues to support passage of this very impor-tant lifesaving legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2430, the FDA Reauthoriza-tion Act of 2017 to reauthorize four important user fee programs: the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, the Medical Device User Fee Act, the Generic Drug User Fee Act, and the Biosimilar User Fee Act. These critically important laws have improved patient access to important therapies and expedited the FDA’s approval times while upholding the most rigorous stand-ards for patient safety. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) was enacted in 1992 when drug re-view times were lagging and FDA simply couldn’t keep up with the flood of new drug applications. Through user fees paid by appli-cants, PDUFA gave FDA the resources it needed to hire and support more staff. The program has been successful in reducing re-view-time backlogs and expediting safe and effective therapies to patients. My legislation created the Medical Device User Fee Act (MDUFA), which was enacted in 2002 and has resulted in significant changes to the medical device industry and within the medical device center at the FDA. Through this user fee program, the device center has improved its efficiency and reduced the time it takes to bring effective medical devices to market. This legislation builds on the progress made in previous user fee agreements and will produce important developments for the medical device industry. The Generic Drug User Fee Agreement (GDUFA) was enacted in 2012 and takes im-portant steps to bring lower-priced drugs to the market more quickly for the American peo-ple. Finally, the Biosimilar User Fee Agree-ment (BsUFA), which was first enacted in 2012 through legislation I authored, is critical to supporting the nascent biosimilar industry and will lead to meaningful progress, break-throughs and cures for the American people. Previous user fee reauthorizations have in-cluded significant gains for pediatric popu-lations. Before the Better Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) and the Pediatric Re-search Equity Act (PREA), which I authored, the vast majority of drugs (more than 80 per-cent) used in children were used off-label, without data for their safety and efficacy. Today, that number has been reduced to 50 percent because of my legislation. Both pro-grams were permanently reauthorized in 2012, and while this agreement includes important changes to BPCA and PREA, there remains a need for more meaningful improvements. This legislation lays important groundwork and pro-vides the foundation for future progress. Finally, I urge my colleagues in the Senate to take up this legislation swiftly. It’s impera-tive that both houses of Congress pass this legislation and send it to the President in a timely manner for him to sign into law in order to provide essential resources to the FDA so they can continue to do their critical work. Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2430, the FDA user fee reau-thorization bill that I worked on with my col-leagues on the Energy & Commerce Com-mittee. Without Congress’ swift action to reauthor-ize this bill, the FDA would not be able to con-duct its critical work ensuring that our nation’s drugs and devices are safe and effective. Patients and families across the country bat-tling diseases like Alzheimer’s, cancer, mul-tiple sclerosis (MS), and diabetes, rely on in-novation to provide new life-saving and life-en-hancing treatments and hopefully one day, cures. Without the FDA, we would not be able to ensure that those treatments and cures work and that they’re safe. To quote Dr. Jeff Allen of the Friends of Cancer Research, ‘‘for the people who cur-rently depend on safe and effective medicines . . . for those who are holding strong for breakthroughs to come . . . and for every fu-ture patient . . . there isn’t time to waste.’’ I urge my colleagues to support the pas-sage of this bill. Mrs. MIMI WALTERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that the House is con-sidering H.R. 2430, the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017. I note that H.R. 2430 would pro-vide the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) with new statutory authority to require the sponsor of an orphan-designated drug, which has certain similarities to an already ap-proved drug, to demonstrate ‘‘clinical superi-ority’’ compared to the already approved drug as a condition of receiving seven years of market exclusivity. This authority will limit the number of drugs that are automatically entitled to seven years of exclusivity, while maintaining incentives for the development of innovative treatments for rare diseases. I also note that the bill would improve trans-parency of the FDA’s execution of the Orphan Drug Act. Specifically, the bill directs the FDA to notify a sponsor in writing of any clinical su-periority rationale on which the FDA relied in designating the sponsor’s drug as an orphan drug. Further, it would require the FDA to pub-lish its clinical superiority findings summaries for all drugs granted exclusivity based on a demonstration of clinical superiority. I urge my colleagues to support the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. M

ENHANCING DETECTION OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING ACT Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 2664) to direct the Secretary of Labor to train certain Department of Labor personnel how to effectively de-tect and assist law enforcement in pre-venting human trafficking during the course of their primary roles and re-sponsibilities, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 2664 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-resentatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Enhancing Detection of Human Trafficking Act’’. 
SEC. 2. DEFINITION OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING. 
In this Act the term ‘‘human trafficking’’ means an act or practice described in para-graph (9) or (10) of section 103 of the Traf-ficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 (22 U.S.C. 7102). 
SEC. 3. TRAINING FOR DEPARTMENT PERSONNEL TO IDENTIFY HUMAN TRAFFICKING. 
(a) I NGENERAL .—Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Labor shall implement a pro-gram to— (1) train and periodically retrain relevant personnel across the Department of Labor that the Secretary considers appropriate, how to effectively detect and assist law en-forcement in preventing human trafficking during the course of their primary roles and responsibilities; and (2) ensure that such personnel regularly re-ceive current information on matters related to the detection of human trafficking, in-cluding information that becomes available outside of the Department’s initial or peri-odic retraining schedule, to the extent rel-evant to their official duties and consistent with applicable information and privacy laws. (b) T
RAINING DESCRIBED .—The training re-ferred to in subsection (a) may be conducted through in-class or virtual learning capabili-ties, and shall include— (1) methods for identifying suspected vic-tims of human trafficking and, where appro-priate, perpetrators of human trafficking; (2) training that is most appropriate for a particular location or environment in which the personnel receiving such training per-form their official duties; (3) other topics determined by the Sec-retary to be appropriate reflecting current trends and best practices for personnel in their particular location or professional en-vironment; (4) a clear course of action for referring po-tential cases of human trafficking to the De-partment of Justice and other appropriate authorities; and (5) a post-training evaluation for personnel receiving the training. SEC. 4. REPORT TO CONGRESS. 
Not later than 1 year after the date of the enactment of this Act, and each year there-after, the Secretary of Labor shall report to the appropriate congressional committees on the training provided to the personnel re-ferred to in section 3(a), including— (1) an evaluation of such training and the overall effectiveness of the program required by this Act; (2) the number of cases referred by Depart-ment of Labor personnel in which human trafficking was suspected and the metrics used by the Department to accurately meas-ure and track its response to instances of suspected human trafficking; and (3) the number of Department of Labor em-ployees who have completed such training as required by this Act. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-ant to the rule, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. W
ALBERG ) and the gen-tleman from the Northern Mariana Is-lands (Mr. S
ABLAN ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan. 
GENERAL LEAVE  
Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and in-clude extraneous material on H.R. 2664. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Michigan? There was no objection. Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2664, the Enhancing Detection of Human Trafficking Act. Labor trafficking is the illegal ex-ploitation of an individual for commer-cial gain. It knows no geological lim-its. It happens across our country and around the globe, including in my home State of Michigan. Victims of labor trafficking are not a uniform group of people. Victims are young children, teenagers, men, and women. In my home State of Michigan, the National Human Trafficking Hotline reported over 38 cases in 2016 involving labor trafficking. This is a 52 percent increase in the number of reported cases since 2015. Globally, the International Labor Or-ganization estimates there are 21 mil-lion people trapped in forced labor. The growing number of human traf-ficking cases is alarming and more needs to be done to identify victims, catch traffickers, and end this form of modern-day slavery. In the course of inspecting workplace safety and labor law compliance within the United States, Department of Labor employees often have a front line to view and to identify patterns of labor exploitation. Providing these em-ployees with the proper training to de-tect and respond to the signs of human trafficking is an important part of the larger comprehensive effort to eradi-cate this unthinkable crime. The Enhancing Detection of Human Trafficking Act would ensure the De-partment has a formal framework in place to detect trafficking and refer cases to law enforcement for prosecu-tion. Specifically, H.R. 2664 would: Direct the Department of Labor to train appropriate staff on how to effec-tively detect instances of human traf-ficking; Ensure personnel regularly receive information on current trends and best practices; Allow flexible training options, in-cluding in-class and virtual learning options; Establish a clear course of action for referring suspected instances of human trafficking to law enforcement; and Require an evaluation and report to Congress on the implementation of the training and the metrics used to meas-ure and track the agency’s response to human trafficking. Mr. Speaker, one of the biggest ob-stacles we face in the fight against human trafficking is awareness. H.R. 2664 will ensure Department of Labor employees have the right training so that they recognize and effectively re-spond to this modern-day slavery. I also thank Ranking Member S
ABLAN for his bipartisan support and work on this issue. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SABLAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2664, a bill to assist the United States Department of Labor in identi-fying and preventing cases of human trafficking. I thank Chairman W
ALBERG for his leadership on this issue and for intro-ducing this legislation of which I am an original cosponsor. As chair and ranking member of the Subcommittee on Health, Employment, Labor, and Pensions of the Education and the Workforce Committee, Mr. W
ALBERG  and I have found common ground on a number of important issues facing the American people, and human traf-ficking is one of them. We may think that human traf-ficking is something that occurs in far- off countries. And, yes, according to the International Labor Organization, there are 21 million men, women, and children around the world who are cur-rently subjected to forced labor. Unfor-tunately, however, the injustice of human trafficking happens right here at home in the United States as well. Polaris, a nonprofit that operates the National Human Trafficking Resource Center hotline here in the United States received reports of over 8,000 cases of human trafficking in our coun-try last year, an increase of 35 percent over the year before. I have seen cases of this terrible scourge firsthand in my own district, the Northern Mariana Islands. A num-ber of construction companies lured foreign workers to come to the Mari-anas with false promises and misrepre-sentations about pay and conditions.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H5487 July 12, 2017 
The companies then withheld the em-ployees’ wages and confiscated their passports. The workers were subjected to horrible working conditions, crowd-ed unsanitary barracks with barely enough food and water. They were forced to work in unsafe conditions, suffering serious injuries without ac-cess to adequate medical care. There was even a workplace fatality. To their credit, the Department of Labor’s OSHA and Wage and Hour divi-sions have worked to address these in-justices, issuing fines and citations, re-covering back wages. But we need to identify human traffickers and prevent cases like this before they happen. That is the purpose of our bill, the Enhancing Detection of Human Traf-ficking Act. H.R. 2664 directs the De-partment of Labor to train appropriate Department staff on how to detect human trafficking, and ensure that these staff people get regular updates on how traffickers are adjusting to avoid detection. b1515 Our bill establishes training for a clear course of action for referring cases of suspected human trafficking to the Department of Justice and other appropriate authorities so these offend-ers are prosecuted. And the bill requires the Department to report back to Congress within a year on the progress that is being made because Congress needs to do more than simply enact programs with lofty goals. We also need to build in mecha-nisms to tell us whether our programs are working as intended. Mr. Speaker, the Enhancing Detec-tion of Human Trafficking Act will, I believe, give the Department of Labor the tools and resources it needs to combat human trafficking. I ask my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this bill. I would like to also thank the leader-ship of the House, especially Chair-woman V
IRGINIA FOXX and Ranking Member B
OBBY SCOTT of the Education and the Workforce Committee, for moving this bill to the floor. And again, I thank my friend, Chairman W
ALBERG , for his leadership in this im-portant area of public policy. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 4 minutes to the gen-tlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. F
OXX), the distinguished chairman of the Education and the Workforce Com-mittee. Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I thank both of my colleagues for their leadership on H.R. 2664 and bringing this impor-tant matter to the attention of the House. I rise to express my strong support for this bill, and to commend, again, my colleagues for making a difference in the fight to end modern slavery. Over the past few years, we have only begun to comprehend the horrors of human trafficking and how it estab-lished a foothold in this country. Thanks to the vigilance of faith-based groups, humanitarians across the globe, and the courage of survivors, we are learning more about the tactics and loopholes human traffickers ex-ploit to prey on the most vulnerable among us. Children are often the ones most vul-nerable to exploitation. It is estimated that one in six endangered runaways are likely victims of this horrific crime. Earlier this year, with the lead-ership of Representatives Guthrie and Courtney, the House passed the Im-proving Support for Missing and Ex-ploited Children Act. That bipartisan legislation supports the critical efforts of the National Cen-ter for Missing & Exploited Children. It includes positive reforms to encourage new and innovative ways to recover and protect missing and exploited chil-dren, including those who are victims of trafficking. We need to do every-thing possible to ensure this vital work will continue, and that is what H.R. 1808 was all about. But this is an issue that demands our ongoing attention. More solutions are needed, and that is why we are here today, to build on the bipartisan work we have already accomplished. The Department of Labor has a unique vantage point for spotting vio-lations in workplaces that can be tell-tale signs of modern slavery and labor exploitation. This bill equips DOL per-sonnel to form partnerships with law enforcement to detect and address signs of human trafficking in Amer-ica’s workplaces. Mr. Speaker, if we can shed light in any corner where this evil may lurk, we must. Again, I commend Mr. WALBERG ’s leadership on this issue and Mr. S
ABLAN for working with him so pas-sionately. I am proud that the Com-mittee on Education and the Workforce could do its part to support their work and bring this bill to the floor. I urge all Members to vote in favor of the Enhancing Detection of Human Trafficking Act. Mr. SABLAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. B
ASS). Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2664, the Enhancing Detection of Human Trafficking Act, a bill to assist the U.S. Department of Labor in identifying and preventing cases of human trafficking. Human trafficking is a global and do-mestic threat to basic human rights and humanity as we know it. However, the injustice of human trafficking is not just a global program. Human rights abuses are happening right here in the United States every day and in every region across the country. Polaris, a nonprofit that operates the National Human Trafficking Resource Center hotline here in the U.S. received reports of over 8,000 cases of human trafficking in our country last year, an increase of 35 percent over the year be-fore. Government agencies must continue to work together to identify and eradi-cate all cases of human trafficking. We can and must do better to prevent cases of abuse before they happen. That is the purpose of this bill, the Enhanc-ing Detection of Human Trafficking Act. H.R. 2664 directs the Department of Labor to train appropriate Department staff on how to detect human traf-ficking and ensure that all personnel at the Department of Labor are provided with regular screening tools to identify and detect trafficking activity. This bill establishes training for a clear course of action, including refer-ring cases of suspected human traf-ficking to the Department of Justice and other appropriate authorities to properly investigate and prosecute of-fenders. This bill also requires the Depart-ment of Labor to report back to Con-gress within a year on the progress that is being made by such efforts. Mr. Speaker, the Enhancing Detec-tion of Human Trafficking Act sup-ports current efforts to combat human trafficking by providing the Depart-ment of Labor the tools and resources it needs to identify and properly re-spond to human rights abuses. I ask my colleagues for a vote in favor of this bill. Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the gen-tleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. COS-
TELLO ). Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2664, the Enhancing Detection of Human Trafficking Act. We all know human trafficking is a serious problem all over the world, but it is not a distant concept. It exists in communities all across this country. Last year, in Pennsylvania alone, there were over 150 human trafficking cases reported, and labor trafficking was the second highest type of trafficking in the Commonwealth. We should and must do all that we can to combat this disgusting activity. This legislation before us now would help train Department of Labor inspec-tors to identify patterns and cir-cumstances surrounding this abuse so that they can assist law enforcement in recognizing and stopping labor ex-ploitation. A significant component of the fight against human trafficking is knowing where it exists, and this legis-lation is an important step forward. Mr. SABLAN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. L
ANCE ). Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman W
ALBERG for his invitation to join him on the floor today to dis-cuss combating human trafficking and in support of the Enhancing Detection of Human Trafficking Act. When people hear the term ‘‘human trafficking,’’ they often think of far-away places, or perhaps even movie

plots. But, unfortunately, human traf-ficking is a horrible 21st century prob-lem here in the United States. We have to do all we can to help com-bat the scourge of human trafficking, and this measure is a strong addition to the actions already taken here in the House, and I commend the chair-man, Ranking Member S
ABLAN , and also the full committee chair, Ms. F
OXX, and Ranking Member S COTT for their leadership on this issue. Making sure Department of Labor employees can identify these practices will be another tool to work against these terrible crimes. We need work-force law violation investigators to be on the lookout for patterns of human trafficking and labor exploitation, and this bill will make it happen. Since 2007, the National Human Traf-ficking Hotline has received nearly 150,000 reports of trafficking here in the United States. The majority of these victims are women and children forced into heinous situations. They need our help. I urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting this measure and to continue to do all we can to combat human trafficking. Mr. SABLAN. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I urge all my col-leagues to please support, vote ‘‘aye’’ on H.R. 2664. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, each year millions of men, women, and children are traf-ficked around the world, including in the United States. It is important that we combat this epidemic. The Enhancing Detection of Human Trafficking Act is truly a bipartisan bill that will ensure that those who are in the field have knowledge, skills, and tools that they need to identify in-stances of human trafficking, assist victims, and properly refer cases so perpetrators can be brought to justice. I would like to reiterate my appre-ciation to Representative S
ABLAN for his support and work on this important issue. This is truly a bipartisan issue. It is an American issue. It is a human issue. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 2664, and I yield back the bal-ance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. W
ALBERG ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2664. The question was taken; and (two- thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

EMPOWERING LAW ENFORCEMENT TO FIGHT SEX TRAFFICKING DE-MAND ACT Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 2480) to amend the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to include an additional permis-sible use of amounts provided as grants under the Byrne JAG program, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 2480 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-resentatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Empowering Law Enforcement to Fight Sex Trafficking Demand Act’’. 
SEC. 2. ADDITIONAL AUTHORIZED USE OF BYRNE JAG FUNDS. 
Section 501(a)(1) of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3751(a)(1)) is amended by adding at the end the following: ‘‘(I) Programs to combat human traf-ficking (including programs to reduce the de-mand for trafficked persons).’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-ant to the rule, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. G
OODLATTE ) and the gen-tlewoman from Texas (Ms. J
ACKSON  L

GENERAL LEAVE  
Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and in-clude extraneous materials on H.R. 2480, currently under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Virginia? There was no objection. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may con-sume. Today, Mr. Speaker, we continue our battle against the scourge of human trafficking with H.R. 2480, the Empow-ering Law Enforcement to Fight Sex Trafficking Demand Act. This bill, in-troduced by our colleague, Congress-woman H
ARTZLER of Missouri, adds antihuman trafficking efforts as an al-lowable use for funds under the Byrne JAG program, the Justice Depart-ment’s flagship grant program for State and local governments and law enforcement. It specifies that the JAG funds may be used for demand reduc-tion operations. Mr. Speaker, there is no question that the fight against human traf-ficking starts at the local level. It in-fects every community, and our local officials and law enforcement are on the front lines in this battle. They are in the best position to assess how to address this issue in their communities and how to use these taxpayer dollars. As part of any comprehensive ap-proach in combating trafficking, local government and law enforcement must address what many call the demand issue; that is, going after those who are buying young victims off the street and, very often, off the internet. This is simple economics applied to a hor-rific crime. Human trafficking is driven by the demand for commercial sex, and this is costing victims their sense of worth and their dignity. By deterring de-mand, traffickers will have fewer buy-ers and may abandon their illegal and horrifyingly reprehensible activity. These demand reduction operations and programs are most often carried out at the local level, and it is impor-tant to ensure local governments have the tools they need to prevent this de-structive crime by deterring people from buying victims. b1530 We cannot tolerate sex trafficking and must be able to act swiftly to com-bat this horrific crime. H.R. 2480 en-sures our communities will be able to do just that. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Con-gresswoman HARTZLER for introducing this legislation, and I urge my col-leagues to support her bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may con-sume. Mr. Speaker, let me thank the chair-man and ranking member of the Judi-ciary Committee for the work that we have done in a bipartisan manner on human trafficking, sex trafficking. Let me thank the gentlewoman, the spon-sor, and the cosponsor, Mr. C
LAY, for their leadership on this legislation and for recognizing that we must give di-rection, as Members of the United States Congress, to how grants are to be utilized. This is a very, very impor-tant initiative to be able to help our law enforcement. Let me give you the real life of some of those who have been sex-trafficked. The life of Esperanza: She was wait-ing for a cousin outside her high school in Mexico one day when a strange man drove up in a car and forced her inside with him and sped way. At that mo-ment, Esperanza had, in effect, become a sex slave. ‘‘He beat me; he raped me,’’ she told CNN. A few times, she tried to escape and failed to escape. The gentleman, the person, the perpetrator, the heinous man, Poncho, now 47, always tracked her down and then beat her again. Eventually, Esperanza realized she was pregnant. Three months later, she said Poncho drove her across the Mexi-can/U.S. border and on to Houston, Texas, where he forced her to work in a cantina called La Costenita. This is a story that reads inside Houston’s sex trade. I am a Represent-ative of the congressional district in Houston where we have recognized that it is one of the hot spots of the sex trade. But I do want to acknowledge that law enforcement, a sheriff, the police chief, the mayor, the head of the city, local government, and county govern-ment have all come together, Members of Congress, faith organizations, and recognized and made a resistant stance

to stand against this sex trade. In fact, I want to applaud them for recognizing the plight of Esperanza. I want to, with enthusiasm, support a bill that would amend the omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to include an additional permis-sible use of amounts provided as grants under the Edward Byrne Memorial Jus-tice Assistance Grant, also known as the Byrne JAG Program, to combat human trafficking, sex trafficking, in-cluding programs to reduce the demand for trafficked persons. The legislation was introduced by Mrs. H
ARTZLER and joined by her col-league, Mr. C
LAY. I am glad to be a co-sponsor, as are members of the Judici-ary Committee and others. Sadly, sex trafficking, like labor trafficking, is a modern-day form of slavery. It is slavery. The epidemic of this abhorrent practice of sex traf-ficking continues. First, sex trafficking occurs nation-wide, and the data from the National Human Trafficking Hotline shows that reports of human trafficking were al-most doubled, from 372 reported cases in 2012 to 670 reported cases in 2016, with sex trafficking accounting for more than 75 percent of all human traf-ficking. Let me be very clear that sex traf-ficking is easy. It is very profitable be-cause, unfortunately, you use the vul-nerable victim over and over again. Take Esperanza. She was waiting to go to high school. She became preg-nant. You would think there would be some form of mercy, but she was forced to be used again, to be sex-trafficked again, and to find herself in a cantina in Houston, Texas, all the way from Mexico. ‘‘I really wanted to speak up, to ask the police for help,’’ Esperanza said, but she got caught up by the threats he would make against the little baby girl that she was now raising. After waiting for this horrific night-mare to end, Esperanza eventually was rescued in a raid of that cantina that I remember very well, thanks to the bravery and steadfast approach of Houston’s finest, like Agent Steven Roskey, a native Houstonian, then, be-lieve it or not, with the Texas Alco-holic Beverage Commission that was really going after the cantina for liq-uor violations. But he was astute and he was law enforcement. Esperanza’s prayers were answered. And so, thankfully, although trauma-tized, Esperanza survived the horrors of sex trafficking, human trafficking. But not all victims are as lucky as that. Esperanza, who fell victim to human trafficking, should absolutely not be treated as a criminal for her in-volvement. Mr. Speaker, I include the CNN arti-cle on Esperanza in the R

[From CNN, Aug. 12, 2016] I
NSIDE HOUSTON ’SSEXSLAVE TRADE  (By Thom Patterson) (CNN) Esperanza was waiting for her cous-ins outside her high school in Mexico one day, when a strange man drove up in a car, forced her inside with him and sped away. At that moment, Esperanza had in effect be-come a sex slave. ‘‘He beat and raped me,’’ she told CNN’s ‘‘The Hunt with John Walsh.’’ She said the man—who called himself Pon-cho—brought her to a madam who showed Esperanza how to charge clients and how to use a condom. A few times Esperanza tried—and failed— to escape, but she said Poncho, now age 47, always tracked her down, and then beat her. Eventually, Esperanza realized she was pregnant. Three months later, she said Pon-cho drove her across the Mexican-US border and on to Houston, Texas, where he forced her to work in a cantina called La Costenita. She gave birth to a baby girl, but Poncho took the infant away as insurance that Esperanza would keep working as a sex slave and wouldn’t escape. ‘‘I really wanted to speak up, to ask the police for help,’’ Esperanza said. ‘‘But I got caught up by the threats he would make to-wards my daughter. I didn’t want anything to happen to her.’’ Esperanza—whose real name is being with-held for her protection—had become just like the more than 19,000 sex trafficking cases re-ported in the US since 2007, according to the National Human Trafficking Resource Cen-ter. The site says more than 2,600 sex traf-ficking cases have been reported in the US this year alone, most of them in California. Texas ranks as the nation’s number-two sex trafficking state, on the website. For the uninitiated, it’s hard to imagine that thousands of young people—overwhelm-ingly women—have been kidnapped in Mex-ico or elsewhere and taken against their will to the United States, where they serve as sex slaves. ‘‘I thought human trafficking was just this crime that happens in third world countries. Until I started to look into my city,’’ said Rachel Alvarez, a human trafficking case worker for the Houston YMCA. Texas authorities first met Esperanza when they raided La Costenita in 2010. ‘‘Her initial demeanor was just kind of stoic,’’ remembered Steve Roskey, who took part in the raid when he was an agent with the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission. ‘‘But then, all of a sudden, we noticed tears start running down her face. She started telling us her story: how she got here, what she was forced to do.’’ When she told police that her pimp, a man named Alfonso Diaz-Juarez who also went by ‘‘Poncho,’’ was holding her daughter, au-thorities sprang into action. ‘‘We knocked on Poncho’s family members’ houses, we knocked on his friends’ houses,’’ Roskey said. ‘‘It irritated the family and friends so much that (Diaz-Juarez) eventu-ally dropped off the child to a cousin, and at about 3 o’clock in the morning, we got a phone call. The child was safe.’’ But Diaz-Juarez was nowhere to be found. Pimps will often lure women from Mexico across the border to the US by promising them better lives, perhaps a better job, Alva-rez said. These pimps may get help from peo-ple the women already know and trust, like a neighbor. Once they’re kidnapped, these women are no longer viewed as people in the eyes of their handlers. They’ve been reduced to a commodity that can be bought and sold re-peatedly in an open market. In the United States, Houston has become one of those markets. ‘‘People see Houston as a hub for human trafficking because of its proximity to the border,’’ said FBI special agent Suzanne Bradley. ‘‘It also has access to the I–10 high-way corridor, which goes across the country, so if they’re smuggling people in and trying to get them into human trafficking in other areas of the country, it’s very easy to get them on that I–10 route and disperse them throughout the country.’’ After the kidnapped women are brought into the US, the beatings begin as a way to keep them from trying to escape. Their cap-tors threaten to hurt family members. Pimps use fear to keep their sex slaves in bondage. ‘‘Poncho was one of the most violent pimps I’ve come across in the 11 years I’ve worked human trafficking,’’ said Edwin Chapuseaux, a former investigator with the Harris County Sheriffs Office. ‘‘He did a lot of brutal things, bordering into torture, to make the girls do what he wanted.’’ A former sex slave we’ll call ‘‘Laura’’ said Poncho knew her ‘‘mother’s name, her ad-dress, everything. He would threaten me, tell me if I talked to anyone that he would hurt my family.’’ A pimp would have a lot to lose if a girl walked out the door. ‘‘If a pimp has, let’s say, four or five girls, and each one is making him, you know, $2,000, $3,000 a week, do the math, tax-free,’’ said Chapuseaux. That works out to a max-imum of $780,000 per year. Laura recalls one night when she counted 70 women working. ‘‘The usual was 30 men. We each had to tend to 30 clients a night.’’ For years federal and local authorities had been gathering evidence against a huge Houston-area sex trafficking network led by Raquel Medeles Hortencia-Arguello. The woman everyone knew as ‘‘Tencha’’ owned a brothel called Las Palmas that of-fered minor-aged girls to customers who would pay up to $500 an hour, according to the FBI. Coincidentally, as a cautionary move, Tencha had distanced herself from Las Palmas by leasing it to Diaz-Juarez. When police found out, they arrested him on a previous warrant. Diaz-Juarez pleaded guilty in a deal with prosecutors that led to his release several months later. Poncho was back on the loose. Authorities continued to gather evidence in the big sex trafficking case. ‘‘We realized early on that we had poten-tial financial crimes, money laundering in-volved in the case, so we got the [Internal Revenue Service] involved in it,’’ said Brad-ley. The IRS began following the money, re-viewing bank statements, locating assets. ‘‘We did an estimate on how much she made from the room rental, entrance fee, and the condoms for the whole entire period she was operating Las Palmas and that esti-mated to be about $12.5 million,’’ said IRS Special Agent Lucy Tan. When it was time for police to move in and raid Las Palmas, 13 people were arrested. Diaz-Juarez wasn’t among them. But Tencha was. Twelve pleaded guilty. Prosecutors charged Tencha with one count of conspiracy to commit sex traf-ficking, one count of conspiracy to harbor aliens, three counts of money laundering and one count of conspiracy to money launder. Tencha pleaded not guilty. When Tencha began crying in front of the judge, saying she was innocent and she had no idea what was going on, it stirred some-thing inside the freed women who once worked for her. They began to get angry. One by one they decided to take the stand and testify against their former captor. ‘‘You didn’t have to speak Spanish to see how much pain they had over what had been done to them, and what they had to do,’’ re-membered Bradley. ‘‘You could just see it in their face, hear it in their voice.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH5490 July 12, 2017 
Ultimately, the jury found Tencha guilty and the judge sentenced her to life in prison. Despite the legal victory against Tencha, authorities are disturbed by the fact that Diaz-Juarez remains free. ‘‘It’s very important to get Poncho ar-rested and prosecuted, because he will not stop doing what he does until he is arrested and put behind bars,’’ said Chapuseaux. Laura, who still fears Poncho, admits she’ll ‘‘feel safer when he is captured. There aren’t any words to describe what a terrible person he is.’’ 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, second, we must provide our law en-forcement with the necessary tools to fight the epidemic. I would like to thank Agent Roskey, our fervent Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo, and chiefs before him for their entire effort and collaboration. Houston law enforcement has been working diligently, but they have lim-ited funds. To be able to use the Byrne grants in this effective way to save one more life, to stop another little girl from de-touring from high school involuntarily and then be steered off, become preg-nant, and no mercy given, driven to an-other country to continue to be uti-lized, abused, victimized, beaten, I think this legislation clearly speaks to the millions of little girls and boys who are not in line but apt to be victims from all over the world coming to the United States, finding themselves in hot points, victimized, and maybe even tragically losing their life. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss H.R. 2480, the ‘‘Empowering Law Enforcement to Fight Sex Trafficking Demand Act of 2017.’’ This bill would amend the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to in-clude an additional permissible use of amounts provided as grants under the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Pro-gram, also known as the Byrne JAG Program, to combat human trafficking (including pro-grams to reduce the demand for trafficked per-sons). This legislation was introduced by Rep-resentative V
ICKY HARTZLER (R–MO) on May 17, 2017 and I am proud to be a Co-Sponsor in this step forward to addressing concerns about sex trafficking in our cities. Sadly, Sex Trafficking, like labor trafficking, is a modern-day form of slavery that includes U.S. citizens, foreign nationals, women, men and children as victims equally. The epidemic of this abhorrent practice of sex trafficking is growing, which makes the need for consideration of all measures to help law enforcement prevent these crimes from occurring even more imperative. First, sex trafficking occurs nationwide, and data from the National Human Trafficking Hot-line show that reports of human trafficking cases have almost doubled in most states, in-cluding Texas, from 372 reported cases in 2012 to 670 reported cases in 2016; with sex trafficking accounting for more than 75% of all human trafficking cases reported. Too often, thousands of young people— overwhelmingly women—have been kid-napped around the world and taken against their will to the United States, where they serve as sex slaves and become victims of these horrendous crimes—especially chil-dren—whom are afraid to seek help from law enforcement because of the risk that they will be treated as criminals rather than the victims they undoubtedly are. Take Esperanza for example. She was wait-ing for her cousins outside of her high school in Mexico one day, when a strange man drove up in a car, forced her inside with him and sped away. At that moment, Esperanza had in effect become a sex slave. Esperanza was an innocent child when she first became a victim of sex trafficking. Her 47 year old trafficker brought her to a madam at a Cantina, who taught her how to have sex with adult men for profit, and the trafficker would beat and rape this young child when-ever she tried to escape. Eventually Esperanza became pregnant and was driven across the Mexico-U.S. border onto Houston, Texas my congressional district, where her baby was taken by her perpetrator as insurance, in order to force Esperanza into his world of sex slave trade. Like so many children living the daily night-mare of human trafficking, Esperanza was ter-rified to tell anyone what was occurring. ‘‘I really wanted to speak up, to ask the police for help,’’ Esperanza said. ‘‘But I got caught up by the threats he would make towards my daughter. I didn’t want anything to happen to her.’’ After waiting for this horrific nightmare to end, Esperanza eventually was rescued in a raid of the Cantina, thanks to the bravery and steadfast approach of Houston’s finest, like Agent Steve Roskey, a native Houstonian, then with the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Com-mission in Houston. Esperanza’s prayers were answered be-cause once she started telling Agent Roskey and the other Houston officers her story of how she got here, what she was forced to do, the identification of her trafficker and the tak-ing of her baby, Houston’s finest and Agent Roskey immediately started knocking on the perpetrator’s family members’ houses, knocked on his friends’ houses, and after the family and friends became irritated, they even-tually dropped off the child to a cousin. The child was safe. Thankfully, although traumatized, Esperanza survived the horrors of human trafficking but not all victims are as fortunate because there are many sad stories laced in this practice, which is why these unfortunate victims, like Esperanza, who fall prey to human trafficking, should absolutely not be treated as criminals for their involvement in these sex, and labor acts. Second, we must provide our law enforce-ment with the necessary tools to fight this epi-demic. I would like to thank Agent Steve Roskey, our fervent Houston Police Chief, Art Acevedo, his entire department, and various other entities for all the hard work they are doing daily to combat this epidemic in sex traf-ficking. Houston’s law enforcement are working dili-gently to take our city back from the grips of those who seek to perpetuate this appalling practice of sex trafficking. Like Houston, law enforcement everywhere are fighting mightily oftentimes, with limited funds to crush the glaring statistics reported across this country by the National Human Trafficking Hotline. Hence we must provide them with meaning-ful resources to make this goal a reality, and ensure that victims are not penalized for the il-legal enterprise of the traffickers that exploit them. This is why we must empower our law en-forcements everywhere, through the Byrne JAG Program, to fight the demand for sex traf-ficking by supporting this bill. Finally, we understand it is already possible for state and local jurisdictions to use JAG Grant Program funding to combat human traf-ficking, including demand reduction, under the current purpose areas. However, I support adding an additional pur-pose area for these grants that emphasizes the need to fund initiatives that target and fight human trafficking, as proposed under this bill. H.R. 2480 will ensure that state and local law enforcement agencies have the funds needed to implement more programs to com-bat human trafficking such as that which oc-curred at the Cantina in Esperanza’s case and all the trafficked victims rescued there that day. The addition of this purpose area would allow state and local jurisdictions to target and penalize buyers who drive the demand for sex acts, human trafficking, and sexual exploi-tation; including the demand for sex trafficking involving children. An example of a project that could be fund-ed by the addition of this purpose area is training for a multi-jurisdictional task force to conduct proactive stings on buyers in an effort to combat human trafficking, like the Cantina raid in my home district in Houston. Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to support this measure. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. HARTZLER ), the chief sponsor of this legislation. Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask for support for H.R. 2480, the Empowering Law Enforcement to Fight Sex Trafficking Demand Act. I would like to thank Chairman G
OODLATTE and Ranking Member C ON-
YERS for their support, as well as Con-gresswoman K
AREN BASS, Congressman S
TEVE CHABOT , and Congressman W IL-
LIAM LACY CLAY from Missouri, my friend, who have all co-led this effort with me. The Empowering Law Enforcement to Fight Sex Trafficking Demand Act expands the authority of the Edward Byrne Justice Assistance Grants Pro-gram, or Byrne JAG, to enable law en-forcement agencies to compete for Fed-eral funding specifically to develop and execute sex trafficking demand reduc-tion programs. Adding this provision provides State and local agencies more flexibility in balancing precious re-sources to address sex trafficking. Today, when many Americans hear the term ‘‘sex trafficking,’’ they might envision a young woman in Eastern Europe being abducted or a far-away brothel in Thailand. While both of these instances, sadly, happen, Ameri-cans must realize that sex trafficking happens in thousands of neighborhoods and cities all across our great country.

young girls, ages 13 and 14, that were recently rescued. Those two innocent girls were locked in a neighborhood home and forced to do drugs and en-gage in sexual acts for money. After some heroic police work, the man re-sponsible was caught, but not before he robbed these two young girls of their innocence and confined them to years of mental torment. This type of event occurs all too often and serves as a stark reminder that this horrendous crime can occur anywhere. It is a domestic problem that we cannot ignore. Since 2007, the National Human Traf-ficking Hotline has reported 22,191 sex trafficking cases in the United States, and countless cases remain unreported. According to leading researchers and law enforcement agencies, one of the primary causes of sex trafficking is consumer-level demand for commercial sex. Sex traffickers have discovered that illicit support of commercial sex is a lucrative business. In 2014, the Urban Institute estimated that the un-derground sex economy ranged from $39.9 million in Denver, Colorado, to $290 million in Atlanta, Georgia. Despite the fact that demand is the ultimate cause of commercial sexual exploitation of women and children, buyers are frequently overlooked as of-fenders in crimes of domestic sex traf-ficking. Recently, leaders in the law enforcement community have discov-ered that the only effective practices for combating sex trafficking are those that include combating demand for commercial sex. There are two primary ways to di-rectly influence actual and potential buyers of commercial sex, and these are termed ‘‘demand reduction pro-grams.’’ They are: education of actual and potential buyers of commercial sex, and law enforcement interventions aimed at deterring those who might buy sex and punishing those who do. Many law enforcement agencies exe-cute demand reduction programs, such as reverse sting operations, john schools, and community education. However, resource limitations preclude them from expanding these efforts. This bill provides law enforcement ex-panded funding opportunities to sup-port demand reduction efforts. This is a huge step in the right direc-tion because the Byrne JAG grant is the cornerstone Federal crime-fighting program, enabling communities to tar-get resources to their most pressing local needs. Byrne JAG’s hallmark is its flexi-bility; thus, States and localities are able to deploy Byrne JAG funding against their most pressing public safe-ty challenges, such as sex trafficking. This allows communities to design complete programs, fill gaps, leverage other resources, and work across city, county, and State lines. The crime of sex trafficking rips through the fabric of our communities and our country. We as Members of Congress must shed light on this hor-rendous epidemic and provide our law enforcement agencies with adequate resources to attack this problem at its source. H.R. 2480 will do that. It is a bi-partisan solution to a nationwide prob-lem. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support this effort. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguish gen-tlewoman from California (Ms. B
ASS), a member of the Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investiga-tions, who has a long history of dealing with the vulnerable children, children who have been in the foster care sys-tem, and a leading voice on the issue of sex and human trafficking. Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in sup-port of H.R. 2480, the Empowering Law Enforcement to Fight Sex Trafficking Demand Act, a simple but powerful bill that will amend the Byrne JAG Grant Program to include funding initiatives aimed at disrupting and reducing the demand for sex trafficking. As we know, dismantling the multi-faceted web of sex trafficking requires collaborative and comprehensive ac-tion at every level of government. I am pleased to join Representative H
ARTZLER and so many of my col-leagues as we continue to address this problem. In conjunction with a number of bills introduced this Congress to strengthen and reauthorize the Trafficking Vic-tims Protection Act, H.R. 2480 ac-knowledges that a comprehensive ap-proach to eliminate sex trafficking necessarily requires the inclusion of demand reduction efforts. Specifically, this bill provides support to State and local jurisdictions working to elimi-nate sex trafficking by expanding the designated use of Byrne JAG funding to include the express purpose of com-bating sex trafficking demand. It is important that we support con-crete and effective measures in further-ance of demand reduction as a critical component of law enforcement. Yet in nearly every State across the country, especially when it comes to underage youth, the buyers of sex tend to be treated as johns. When we are looking at underage girls, anybody that is pur-chasing sex should be viewed as a child molester. Just as we are beginning to see the need to acknowledge the shift in how we see and respond to victims of sex trafficking—most of whom are minors, 59 percent of all reported cases in 2016 per Polaris National Hotline, and near-ly all of them having involvement in the child welfare system, 86 percent as reported in the 2016 National Center for Missing & Exploited Children—there must be a paradigm shift in how we see and respond to those engaged in the il-licit buying of women and children for sex. b1545 Sex trafficking reduction programs under this bill would support enhanced efforts to arrest and prosecute these of-fenders. This bill would further help ju-risdictions implement and facilitate necessary training programs designed to help law enforcement understand, identify, and appropriately respond fundamentally to those who buy and perpetrate sex trafficking. Just as law enforcement must make critical efforts in distinguishing and identifying victims in need of services from petty criminals, so, too, must ef-forts be made to identify and prosecute dangerous and predatory sex offenders. Thus, State and local justice systems would be eligible to receive Byrne JAG money to support innovative advance-ments in developing and acquiring cut-ting-edge technology. For example, H.R. 2480 would support the use of programs like Spotlight, a web-based tool used by over 4,000 law enforcement agencies in the U.S. and Canada to enable them to collaborate across jurisdictions for streamlined tracking of child sex trafficking vic-tims. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California. Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, over the past year, reports showed that Spotlight identified, on average, five kids per day, and that law enforcement using Spotlight daily are seeing a 60 percent time savings in their investigative process. For these reasons, I urge my col-leagues to support this bipartisan bill and the need to invest in comprehen-sive measures to prevent and attack sex trafficking demands. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I re-serve the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. C
LAY), a colleague of the sponsor of the bill, Mrs. H
ARTZLER  from Missouri. I thank him for his leadership on the issues of sex traf-ficking and human trafficking. Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Texas for yielding. I rise today as an original cosponsor of H.R. 2480, the Empowering Law En-forcement to Fight Sex Trafficking De-mand Act, along with my friend and distinguished colleague from Missouri, Congresswoman H
ARTZLER , and other colleagues. This bipartisan act aims to provide local law enforcement with additional tools to fight the heinous epidemic of sex trafficking by expanding the au-thority of the vital Byrne Justice As-sistance Grant act to enable law en-forcement agencies to compete for Fed-eral funding, specifically to develop and implement sex trafficking demand reduction programs. Our legislation would also add an ad-ditional provision for Byrne JAG fund-ing to allow State and local agencies more flexibility in prioritizing precious resources to combat domestic sex traf-ficking.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH5492 July 12, 2017 
young people for the purposes of sexual exploitation is a form of 21st century slavery that is pervasive around the world, around this country, and even in my home State of Missouri, as we heard earlier. Sadly, because of my district’s cen-tral location and easy access to cross- country interstates and modes of transportation, the St. Louis area is one of the top 20 markets for the hor-rific and inhuman crime. Most of the victims are minor children, and some of them have been kidnapped, beaten, and deceived by organized criminal en-terprises who are exploiting their bod-ies for profit. But the sick and the inhuman prac-tice could not continue without steady demand, and reducing that market is exactly the purpose of this important bill. According to a recent report by the National Human Trafficking Resource Center, this multibillion dollar slavery system victimizes over 20 million young people worldwide, with at least 1
1⁄2million of those victims in North America. Yet, last year in the United States, only about 5,000 cases were ac-tually reported, leaving tens of thou-sands of other victims in the shadows with no protection, no help, and no hope. As reported in the February 23, 2016 edition of The Atlantic magazine: 
According to the United Nations’ Office on Drugs and Crime, sexual exploitation is the most commonly identified form of forced labor worldwide. And as a whole, human trafficking is a lucrative industry that, around the globe, rakes in at least $150 bil-lion. But it is unclear whether the numbers are an accurate representation of the problem, because many cases are not reported, accord-ing to Monique Villa, the CEO of the Thom-son Reuters Foundation, which works to combat human trafficking. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman from Missouri. Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, the article continues on: 
The problem with human trafficking is that, of course, the victims are silenced. We don’t have good data about it. You don’t know how many slaves there are around the world. Traffickers also play into the narrative by telling victims who are exploited for sex that they are offenders, threatening to call the police and report them for prostitution if they push back. This makes sex trafficking particularly challenging because victims might be fearful of going to law enforcement and being charged with a crime. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to sup-port this legislation. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I re-serve the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may con-sume. Let me thank the sponsor of this bill for her leadership. I am delighted to work with her as a cosponsor. And the speakers on the outside who are co-sponsors, I thank them for their impor-tant contribution. I simply want to take this time to close and to say to all of us: Don’t for-get the Esperanzas—plural—and their little boys as well, who are sex traf-ficked. Let us not forget them. The addition of this purpose area added to the Byrne grants would allow States and local jurisdictions to target and penalize buyers who drive the de-mand for sex acts, human trafficking, and sexual exploitation, including de-mand for sex trafficking involving chil-dren. An example of a project that could be funded by the addition of this purpose area is training for a multi-jurisdictional task force to conduct proactive stings on buyers in an effort to combat human trafficking, just like what was done at the cantina raid in my home community in Houston. The Texas Alcoholic Beverage Com-mission officer was one of those who helped bring this cantina, this sub-stitute for sex trafficking kingpin down, and saved Esperanza. Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to thank Members on both sides of the aisle for their hard work on this, espe-cially the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. HARTZLER ) for taking the lead on this, also the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. C
LAY), as well as the ranking member of the full Judiciary Com-mittee, Mr. C
ONYERS ; and of the sub-committee, Ms. J
ACKSON LEE; and the subcommittee chair, Mr. S
ENSEN -
BRENNER . Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-leagues to support this very important legislation that will help direct impor-tant resources to State and local gov-ernments to reduce demand for sex trafficking, and help to maybe protect and save a few young people and other people from this horrible crime. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. G
OODLATTE ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2480. The question was taken; and (two- thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

(6) Recruitment and use of children in armed conflict by government forces has continued in 2016 in South Sudan with the return to hostilities.

GENERAL LEAVE  
Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speak-er, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to re-vise and extend their remarks and to include any extraneous material in the R
ECORD . The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speak-er, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the right word for the type of slavery we see today, the type of human trafficking that is slavery, is to focus on the fact that this is inden-tured servitude. This is human slavery, and traffickers around the world in-creasingly exploit over a million indi-viduals—I am talking about women and children—in sex trafficking for commercial gain. According to credible estimates, if we add to that those who are engaged in forced labor, that number that are actually enslaved is some 20 million. It is a coercive, multibillion-dollar indus-try that destroys families, destroys communities, strengthens brutal criminal networks, and tramples human dignity. This plague is really global. It is not limited to the developing world. At a regular meeting of the Human Traf-ficking Congressional Advisory Com-mittee I set up in southern California

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH5498 July 12, 2017 
nearly 4 years ago, I have met with brave survivors who endured forced labor and commercial sexual exploi-tation in my home State of California. I think of Angela Guanzon locked into her abusive workplace, sleeping on the hallway floor. I think of Carissa Phelps being sold on the streets of Fresno at the age of 12 by a very vio-lent pimp. Meeting them and having them tes-tify showed me and many others that the horror of trafficking lies not in sta-tistics, but in stolen lives. In the words of the great abolitionist, Frederick Douglass, enslavement is such an af-front to human conscience that, in his words, ‘‘ . . . to expose it, is to kill it. Slavery is one of those monsters of darkness to whom the light of truth is death.’’ Exposing the harsh reality of human trafficking to international daylight is a central tenet of the legislation here that we are reauthorizing today. b1600 In the late 1990s, under the leadership of Congressman C
HRIS SMITH, the au-thor of today’s bill, the Foreign Affairs Committee initiated the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, which became law in 2000. That law created the an-nual Trafficking in Persons Report and the country tier rankings that put the issue on the radar screens of world gov-ernments for the first time and every year thereafter. I was proud to have supported that legislation. It created the possibility of sanctions against the worst offenders. It also established law enforcement and other domestic initiatives to combat trafficking within the United States, which have been refined in the mul-tiple reauthorizations that have fol-lowed. The law has produced notable suc-cesses. More than 120 countries, in fact, have now enacted antitrafficking laws, and many are improving their prosecu-tion and conviction of those who are involved in trafficking. Countless lives have been improved and have been saved as a result. In the TIP Report released 2 weeks ago, 27 countries were upgraded to a higher tier, and that is progress. But sustained pressure and scrutiny are needed. Enacting a law is not the same thing as enforcing it, and, unfortu-nately, 21 countries slipped to a lower tier in last year’s report. I am proud to be an original cospon-sor of H.R. 2200, the Frederick Douglass Trafficking Victims Prevention and Protection Reauthorization Act, which continues and updates our fight against human trafficking. It extends until 2021 the current authorizations for our international and domestic pro-grams, which expire at the end of Sep-tember. It also contains multiple re-forms and refinements to U.S. pro-grams, and it strengthens the annual TIP Report and tier rankings. I am pleased that this bill incor-porates the text of a bill of mine, H.R. 1625, the TARGET Act, which I intro-duced earlier this year and the House passed in March. This important provi-sion turns the tables on international traffickers by authorizing the State Department to offer and publicize bounties for their arrest and for their conviction. I again want to thank the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. SMITH) and the gentlewoman from California (Ms. B
ASS) for introducing this strong, bi-partisan bill. I also want to thank the other seven committees of referral for the input and assistance they provided on the portions of the bill within their jurisdiction. H.R. 2200 is a critical contribution to the cause of human freedom and the cause of human dignity. It deserves our unanimous support. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-self such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2200, a bill to reauthorize $130 million in currently appropriated funds in order to continue, over the next 4 years, critical and necessary work to fight sex and labor trafficking. This bill builds upon the remarkable work of the original Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000, the cornerstone of Federal human trafficking legisla-tion. I want to thank my colleagues Chair-man R
OYCE and especially Chairman C
HRIS SMITH for his pioneering leader-ship. Despite great strides and the tremen-dous progress we have made in expos-ing and beginning to understand the complexities and growing obstacles of human trafficking, we still have much to do. I am particularly thankful for the in-clusion of my language in section 103, which provides a modification to grants for victims services in order to provide a necessary focus on young vic-tims in the child welfare system. Spe-cifically, this section will amend the Trafficking Victims Protection Act to address a key reason children and women have difficulty leaving their ex-ploiter: the lack of housing. They have nowhere to go. As with all antitrafficking measures, I am particularly concerned about what we are doing to combat the dev-astating epidemic of young girls in the foster care system falling prey to child exploitation and sex trafficking. The average age of a girl entering into sex trafficking is 12 years old. In 2016, an estimated one out of six endangered runaways reported to the National Center for Missing & Ex-ploited Children were likely child sex trafficking victims. Of these reported victims, 86 percent were in the care of social services or foster care when they ran. One seasoned detective in Los Ange-les recently reported during a dem-onstration on law enforcement tech-nology used to identify victims that every single girl he has ever encoun-tered through sex trafficking or com-mercially exploited sex activity has been in the child welfare system. It cannot be overstated that the pur-pose of the child welfare system is to protect children who are abused or ne-glected. It is our responsibility to make sure these children do not fall be-tween the cracks. It is devastating to know that we have failed many of them. Just as if one of our own children in our family went missing, a child that is under the care of the government that goes missing demands our most aggres-sive response and effort to find, save, and protect them. Our most urgent priority should be disrupting the child welfare-to-traf-ficking pipeline and finding better, more effective ways to meet the crit-ical needs of this vulnerable popu-lation. In particular, as we continue to tackle child sex trafficking in the United States, it is imperative that we provide a special focus on the imme-diate and long-term housing needs of at-risk foster youth. Young girls and disconnected youth have particular and sensitive needs as trafficking victims. Current funding for housing and shel-ter for victims of child sex trafficking is insufficient to meet the growing de-mand for youth services, especially young foster girls exploited through their emotional and financial vulnera-bilities. At every level of government, we have an urgent responsibility to shut down pathways for child sex traf-ficking and to invest in critical hous-ing needs for vulnerable youth and girls. This responsibility includes sup-porting and adopting H.R. 2200. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speak-er, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. S
MITH). He is the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Sub-committee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights, and Inter-national Organizations, and, of course, he is the author of the original Traf-ficking Victims Protection Act. He is also the author of this bill today. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished chairman E
DROYCE for yielding. I thank him for his leadership on traf-ficking, for this bill in particular, for the markup, and for all of the assist-ance he provided. I also thank E
LIOT E
NGEL , our ranking member. I thank them from the bottom of my heart. I want to thank K
AREN BASS, the lead Democrat on the bill, for her excep-tional leadership and her collaboration on this legislation. I want to thank Speaker R
YAN and Majority Leader M
CCARTHY . I have to say—and I have been working on human trafficking since about 1995, chaired probably more than 30 hearings and written four laws—I have never seen such a deep commitment to fight-ing trafficking and protecting victims

than our leadership. It is unparalleled and it is inspired. K
EVIN MCCARTHY helped ensure time-ly consideration. There are eight com-mittees of referral. Sometimes that is a death knell for any bill. It is so hard to secure agreements and vote them out. Well, each of those chairmen and their staffs worked diligently and in good faith. At the end of the day, the leadership was there. They had our back on the legislation. I want to thank Chairman R
OYCE , again, for his extraordinary leadership as well. Mr. Speaker, ever since the Traf-ficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 became law in 2000, combating human trafficking has been a major priority in the United States and, indeed, globally. Over the last 17 years, police and civil society organizations—many of them faith based—have identified and rescued more than 250,000 victims worldwide. Some put that number at close to 300,000. Prosecution of traf-fickers in the U.S. has increased by more than 500 percent, but, frankly, our task is far from accomplished. The International Labor Organiza-tion suggests that nearly 21 million people in the world today are enslaved, most of them women and children. That is unconscionable. Every human life is of infinite value. We have a duty to protect the weakest and most vul-nerable from harm. The Frederick Douglass Trafficking Victims Prevention and Protection Re-authorization Act of 2017 is comprehen-sive. It is bipartisan, and it is designed to strengthen, expand, and create new initiatives to protect victims, pros-ecute traffickers, and prevent this cru-elty and exploitation from happening in the first place. Title I of the bill focuses on com-bating trafficking in the United States. Title II focuses on the world. Title III authorizes appropriations of more than half a billion dollars over 4 years, in-cluding reauthorization of the TVPA of 2000. The legislation, Mr. Speaker, is named in honor of the incomparable Frederick Douglass on the eve of his 200th birthday. Born a slave in 1818, he escaped when he was 20 and heroically dedicated his entire life to abolishing slavery and, after emancipation, to ending the Jim Crow laws in order to achieve full equality for African-Amer-ican citizens. A gifted orator, author, editor, statesman, and Republican, he died in 1895. Human trafficking, Mr. Speaker, is modern-day slavery that needs a Her-culean effort to eradicate. Among its numerous provisions and one that is of special interest to the Frederick Douglass Family Initiative— and we worked very closely with them on this—it authorizes HHS grant money to ‘‘establish, expand, and sup-port programs’’ to provide age appro-priate information to students all across America to avoid becoming vic-tims of sex and labor trafficking as well as to educate school staff to recog-nize and respond to signs of trafficking. It adopts a number of best practices, like for example making sure that when government employees book rooms, that we utilize hotels where they have initiated efforts and spon-sored training to eradicate child sex trafficking. We do the same thing with airlines. The flight attendants—Delta is a classic example—once trained, can spot trafficking in progress, inform the pilot, and when that plane lands or jet lands, ensure that if there is a situa-tion, there is an arrest of the traf-fickers and a rescue of the woman or children who are being trafficked. We will now try, to the best of our ability, to hold the airlines to account. There needs to be reporting. It is al-ready the law that they should provide this training. Now we want to ensure that training actually happens. Chairman R
OYCE talked about the TIP Report. Just a couple weeks ago, Secretary Tillerson announced the 2017 TIP Report. It is a voluminous and very accurate report about what is happening in 190 countries around the world, including the United States. Those countries that are designated Tier 3, egregious violator, are subject to sanctions. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. P
ERRY ). The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speak-er, I yield an additional 2 minutes to the gentleman. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I just want to commend the Trump administration for finally hold-ing China to account as a Tier 3 viola-tor. A worst offender. The pending bill makes a number of important reforms to the TIP Report and how it is prepared. My hope is that we will have an even better, more accu-rate, and more effective effort at hold-ing countries to account. Again, this legislation applies to the United States for labor and sex traf-ficking as well as to the world. Again, I do want to thank all those who have been involved in it. Let me just say we worked on this bill for well over a year with ATEST; Polaris; IJM; World Vision; United; Hu-manity; ECPAT; United States Con-ference of Catholic Bishops; Shared Hope International; CATW; Ambas-sador Swanee Hunt; the National Cen-ter for Missing & Exploited Children, which provided valuable insight; and others. They were all very much a part of our effort. I also want to thank critical staff, in-cluding Luke Murray and Kelly Dixon, from the Majority Leader’s Office, who are outstanding—they get the job done, and they ask all the right questions about substance and process and helped us along—Doug Anderson, counsel of the House Committee on Foreign Af-fairs; Mary Noonan; my chief of staff, Piero Tozzi; Allison Hollabaugh; Krystal Williams, K
AREN BASS’ staff member; and so many others on the committees that also made such a huge difference in enabling us to get this through all the committees to the floor today. I urge my colleagues to pass the bill. Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE), who is the ranking member on the Crime, Ter-rorism, Homeland Security, and Inves-tigations Subcommittee of the Judici-ary Committee. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, let me thank the authors of the legisla-tion, Mr. S
MITH and Ms. B ASS, for their leadership, and thank Chairman R
OYCE  for again reemphasizing the impor-tance of this in terms of all commit-tees, including the number of commit-tees that have been noted. Let me thank the cosponsors for ac-knowledging as well, Frederick Doug-lass. It is right that he was born in slavery, but he reminded us that there is no power without struggle, and there will have to be a struggle to end sex trafficking and human trafficking. Mr. Speaker, I am reminded of the 1990s, when I met my first real modern- day slaves on the border of Bangladesh, where we were seeing women fleeing who had been trafficked and who had been utilized sexually. Their parents had sold them out of desperation. b1615 They were actual true slaves who were fleeing to the border of Ban-gladesh. That is a startling and stark recognition that in the 1990s, and now in the 21st century, slavery still exists. I am delighted to be an original co-sponsor of this legislation and to have worked on these issues, and to ac-knowledge the commemoration of Mr. Douglass’ 200th birthday. So I am grateful for the $130 million in current funds appropriated to ensure a robust response to fight human traf-ficking; again, to do this at home and abroad; and to acknowledge the alli-ance to end slavery and trafficking at the National Center for Missing & Ex-ploited Children, who are supporting this. The bill would also provide human services grants, opportunities to be used for educating children and staff in U.S. schools about human trafficking. Of course, it would help my own center in Houston, the Center to End Traf-ficking and Exploitation of Children, or CETEC. I thank them for their great work. It is the only center of its kind in Texas established to combat minor sex trafficking. In addition, this impor-tant bill helps many others. Let me conclude by simply saying that I support the idea of holding air-lines accountable. We have been work-ing with them. Homeland Security has been working with them. The flight at-tendants want to be engaged. All of us should be engaged in fighting sex traf-ficking. Mr. Speaker, I ask for support of the bill. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speak-er, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman

from Ohio (Mr. C HABOT ), a senior mem-ber of the Committee on Foreign Af-fairs. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2200, H.R. 2480, and H.R. 2664, three over-whelmingly bipartisan bills curbing and combating modern-day slavery at home and abroad. I want to particularly thank Chair-man R
OYCE , as well as Chairman S MITH and the gentlewoman from California, Ms. B
ASS, the ranking member, all who have been leaders in this area for quite some time now, and we appreciate that very much. As a parent, a grandparent now, and as a former teacher, I know that edu-cation empowers children. These bills on the floor today ensure that we are doing our utmost to allow every child across the globe the opportunity to reach their highest potential. That is why I introduced the bipartisan H.R. 2408, Protecting Girls’ Access to Edu-cation Act, earlier this year, along with my Democratic colleague, R
OBIN K
ELLY . By providing access to safe primary and secondary education, our bill aims to offer educational opportunities to the approximately 62 million girls globally who are not in school. There are 62 million girls who are not in school. Similarly, these three bills, and the one that we are discussing right now on the floor today, are aimed at eradi-cating human trafficking and should improve every girl’s chances for a qual-ity education and a more peaceful and stable life, both in the United States and abroad. Unfortunately, there are young girls and women here in this country who are vulnerable in the greatest country on the face of the Earth. Obviously, the problem is much worse across the globe. I want to thank all colleagues on both sides of the aisle for truly work-ing in a bipartisan fashion to at least get a handle on one of the toughest things that we face globally, and that is child trafficking, human trafficking, and a whole range of issues along this line. Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Ha-waii (Ms. G
ABBARD ). Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, too often we hear about human trafficking and sex slavery. It is often dismissed as a crime that only happens ‘‘over there’’—overseas or in a foreign coun-try. The Global Slavery Index estimated that nearly 46 million people across 167 countries were victims of human traf-ficking in 2016. This problem is very real. But here at home, it is also a problem, where we have children and young people who are forced or coerced into sex work and hard labor in our communities all across the country. As America’s gateway to Asia, my home State of Hawaii sees an unprece-dented number of people taken from their homes to be exploited here on our shores. In 2010, the FBI freed 400 Thai nationals from a Hawaii farm, the larg-est human trafficking case in our mod-ern history. In Hawaii, I know personally of girls as young as 11 and 13 years old who were recruited from schools, malls, beaches, and other places, and ex-ploited by traffickers. While every State, including Hawaii, has passed legislation to ban trafficking and clas-sify it as a felony, clearly stronger, fur-ther action is needed to combat this modern, international slave trade. This bill, the Frederick Douglass Trafficking Victims Prevention and Protection Reauthorization Act, will do many things, including expanding programs to help educators recognize and respond to signs of human traf-ficking in minors to try to prevent this abuse and support local law enforce-ment as they identify prosecutors who will focus on cases involving sex and slave trafficking. I strongly support this legislation and urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ to give these innocent men, women, and children a chance for safe, proactive, and healthy lives in our communities. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speak-er, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. BEATTY ). Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Congresswoman K
AREN  B
ASS of California, for her relentless work, and also my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, including Con-gressman C
HRIS SMITH, for working on this. Mr. Speaker, today is a historic day. I stand on the U.S. House floor to advo-cate for the passage of the Frederick Douglass Trafficking Victims Preven-tion and Protection Reauthorization Act. I have had many meetings with Ken-neth Morris, Frederick Douglass’ great-great-great-grandson on this issue, sharing with him my work on my bill, H.R. 246, from the last Congress, which improves the response of victims of child sex trafficking. I am com-mitted to ending human trafficking and to ensuring that this bill honoring Frederick Douglass’ legacy becomes a law. The Frederick Douglass Trafficking Victims Prevention and Protection Re-authorization Act puts $130 million in funding for the prevention, protection, and, yes, prosecution of human traf-ficking. This investment is so needed, Mr. Speaker, because victims of human trafficking often live in the shadows of society. That is why it is up to all of us and why it is a bipartisan bill. This legislation makes an investment in education. We have heard what it does with airports and what it does if you have survivors and government working together. So let me end by reminding all of us that, in the words of Frederick Doug-lass, if we talk about protecting our children and preventing human sex trafficking, he would say, as he has said, ‘‘It is easier to build strong chil-dren’’ than to repair a broken system. Let us talk about protection. These young girls and boys are sometimes held by invisible chains. We are here today to remove those chains. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speak-er, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. FRANKEL ). Ms. FRANKEL of Florida. Mr. Speak-er, I also give my thanks to Mr. R
OYCE ; Mr. S
MITH; and my colleague, Ms. B
ASS, for their leadership. I am very proud to be part of this bipartisan act to stop what we call modern-day slav-ery of men, women, and children. Human trafficking is a global crisis of epic proportions. After drug traf-ficking, it is the number two criminal enterprise on Earth. Yes, it happens right here in our own backyard. Recently, I met Shandra. She is a mother; a college graduate; and for-merly a banker in Indonesia, until a fi-nancial crisis hit. Looking for a better life for her family, she came legally to the United States, taking what she thought was a job in the hospitality in-dustry. The minute she landed in the United States of America, her hopes turned into a living hell. It is hard to put what happened to her in words. Shandra’s new employer held her by force. With threats of violence, he drugged her and sold her into prostitu-tion day after day, for years. Finally, after multiple attempts to escape, she actually climbed through a bathroom window and went to safety. Mr. Speaker, shockingly, as we speak here in this room today, there are mil-lions of innocent victims like Shandra who are held in some form of cruel ser-vitude. Our effort today will save lives and prevent horrific suffering. I am proud to be part of these efforts. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speak-er, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. C
AROLYN B. M ALONEY ). Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank my col-league and friend for yielding, and I thank her for her extraordinary leader-ship. I would like to be associated with her comments describing this horrific crime. Human trafficking outpaces drugs and guns as the world’s fastest growing and most prosperous criminal activity. But unlike guns and drugs, which can only be sold once, in trafficking, the human body is sold over and over and over again until it kills the person. I very strongly support the ending of this modern-day slavery through the Frederick Douglass Trafficking Vic-tims Prevention and Protection Reau-thorization Act. I have worked closely with Representative S
MITH since 1995,

Representative P OE, Representative W
AGNER , and others, to combat this despicable crime. This legislation, first passed in 2000, revolutionized U.S. efforts against traf-ficking here and abroad. It included language I offered targeting traffic on the demand side, which is very impor-tant and key to punishing the real criminals here: pimps, johns, and traf-fickers who buy and sell their victims. This legislation makes improvements to programs and policies that combat trafficking here and around the world. It helps law enforcement in their ef-forts to prosecute, which is growing. It improves professional training to iden-tify potential trafficking victims and provides services to enable survivors to rebuild their lives with dignity. Perpetrators of modern-day slavery are profiting to the tune of $150 billion a year. We need a coordinated, com-prehensive approach to stop it. I urge all of my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’ This bill saves lives. It is impor-tant. I am thrilled to be part of the ef-fort to combat human trafficking in our world. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speak-er, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Cali-fornia (Mrs. D
AVIS). Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speak-er, I thank my colleagues, C
HRIS SMITH and K
AREN BASS, for spearheading this important bill and for really putting tremendous energy into it. Mr. Speaker, far too often, it is our children who fall victim to the horror of human trafficking. As you have heard this afternoon, we must do ev-erything that we can to stop this injus-tice. Often it has been said of human traf-ficking that it is hiding in plain sight. Advocates and survivors are always telling me that it is important to pun-ish traffickers, but we also need to focus on prevention. The reauthorization of the Frederick Douglass Trafficking Victims Preven-tion and Protection Reauthorization Act strengthens what we need in this holistic approach. It includes my bill, the Empowering Educators to Prevent Trafficking Act. This language in the bill creates a training program that I think you have heard about that em-powers educators to spot the signs of trafficking and, in turn, teach their students how to protect themselves from becoming victims. With the passage of this bill, our schools can join the resistance in the fight against trafficking. Armed with knowledge, students and teachers can join the battle lines against the injus-tice of modern-day slavery. I want to thank all those who have participated in this bill, and I urge my colleagues to support it. b1630 Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speak-er, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the author of this important legislation, Mr. CHRIS SMITH; and I thank Chair-man R
OYCE for bringing it to the floor. I support this bill and I encourage my colleagues to do so as well. Mr. Speaker, I yield back that bal-ance of my time. Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speak-er, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I would just mention, Mr. Speaker, that 20 years ago, human trafficking was unknown, I think, to most Ameri-cans and there was little public aware-ness of the severity of what we are call-ing here today modern-day slavery. Seventeen years ago, Congress led on this issue by passing the Trafficking Victims Protection Act. We had very strong bipartisan support, and the rankings, the sanctions, the programs created by that law have been instru-mental in building the momentum and awareness that exists out there today. And with each reauthorization, those laws have been fine-tuned, they have been strengthened. This bill continues that tradition. It is time to recommit ourselves to this noble fight against slave-like labor and sexual exploitation of underage children. I have asked some of the victims why it is that so many of these criminal gangs move from drug running and other kinds of activity into this kind of behavior, and part of the response is: Because, you know, in a drug war, a gang member can get himself killed, but it is a lot easier to exploit a 14- year-old underage girl, it is a lot easier to be in that kind of business than it is in the more dangerous business. We have got to overcompensate for this reality by passing legislation which allows these additional tools to be used to close down these criminal syndicates and to create real deter-rence for those gang members who con-sider going into this line of work. So I thank Mr. S
MITH, Congress-woman K
AREN BASS, and all my fellow cosponsors on this bill. It deserves our strong support. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. R
OYCE ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2200, as amended. The question was taken; and (two- thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

GENERAL LEAVE  
Mr. M CCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Mem-bers may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their re-marks and insert extraneous material on H.R. 23. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. VALADAO ). Is there objection to the re-quest of the gentleman from Cali-fornia? There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-ant to House Resolution 431 and rule XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consider-ation of the bill, H.R. 23. The Chair appoints the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. P

IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE  
Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill (H.R. 23) to provide drought relief in the State of California, and for other purposes, with Mr. P
ERRY in the chair. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the first time. The gentleman from California (Mr. M
CCLINTOCK ) and the gentleman from California (Mr. H
UFFMAN ) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. M
CCLINTOCK ). Mr. M
CCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 5 minutes. Mr. Chairman, in California, 5 years of historic drought caused billions of dollars of damage to our economy, de-stroyed tens of thousands of jobs, and brought many communities within just months of literally running out of water, all because we couldn’t store water from the wet years to assure plenty in the drought years. Then back to back with this historic drought, we have just had one of the wettest winters on record. Massive tor-rents of water threatened entire com-munities on its way to be wasted in the Pacific Ocean, all because of the very same problem: we have few reservoirs to store this superabundance of water for the next drought. Even before the drought, massive water diversions required by a growing tangle of laws and regulations had cre-ated devastating economic hardship in California’s fertile Central Valley. Those same policies forced us to re-lease what precious little water we had remaining behind our dams to adjust river temperatures for fish. For three Congresses now, the House has acted to fix this folly. Today, H.R. 23, the GROW Act, by Congressman D
AVID VALADAO , addresses the policy, regulatory, and administrative failures that have mismanaged our water sup-plies across the West. The GROW Act includes both short- term and long-term provisions aimed at restoring water reliability and cer-tainty to cities and farms. It includes seven titles that expand water storage, improve infrastructure, protect water rights, and create more abundant and reliable water resources to benefit both communities and the environment.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH5504 July 12, 2017 
The GROW Act gives Federal agen-cies the tools they need to help safe-guard communities from the hardship of future droughts. It codifies the his-toric Bay-Delta accord that provided an equitable balance between human and environmental needs and guaran-teed the reliability and predictability of our water supplies. It strengthens northern California area-of-origin water rights and pre-vents the Federal Government from de-manding that people give up their water rights in order to operate on Federal land. It streamlines the endlessly time- consuming and cost-prohibitive envi-ronmental permitting that is blocking new reservoir construction by coordi-nating Federal agencies and requiring transparency of the science behind its decisions. It requires completion of studies for five new reservoirs that have dragged on for decades. In the past, we have heard three ob-jections from opponents. The first is it will decimate salmon fisheries. On the contrary, it saves those fisheries where the environmental policies of the past 40 years have utterly failed to protect them. The GROW Act targets the nonnative predators that are responsible for 90 percent of salmon losses as the smolts try to make their way to the ocean. It encourages the use of fish hatcheries to assure that salmon populations will in-crease dramatically in future years. The second objection is that it will preempt State water rights laws. Read section 302 of the bill. ‘‘The Secretary of the Interior is directed, in operation of the Central Valley Project, to ad-here to California’s water rights laws governing water rights priorities . . .’’ It goes on to say that diversions ‘‘shall not be undertaken in a manner that alters the water rights priorities established by California law.’’ It does have provisions necessary to codify the Bay-Delta agreement and combat invasive predators, but this doesn’t set a precedent for other States. California is unique among the States in the fact that it operates with a coordinated operating agreement that combines the Federal Central Val-ley Project and the California State water projects and runs them as a uni-fied system. This was at the request of California and with its consent. The third objection is that it rewards powerful agricultural interests at the expense of consumers. This is nonsense. An average consumer uses roughly 100 gallons a day to wash the dishes, water the lawn, everything else we do in our daily lives. But when you purchase a cheeseburger, you have just consumed 750 gallons of water because that is what it takes to grow the ingredients in that cheeseburger. Buy a pair of jeans, you have just used 1,800 gallons of water. The fact is that all of this water ben-efits consumers and the tens of thou-sands of farm workers and others who provide for their families from this water. Droughts are nature’s fault. Water shortages are our fault. They are a choice we made a generation ago when we chose to neglect our infrastructure and mismanage our water resources. It has led to increasingly severe water shortages, spiraling utility and grocery bills, and economic stagnation. The GROW Act chooses a brighter future of abundance and prosperity that can begin today with our vote. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may con-sume. Mr. Chairman, so much for regular order. The bill before us today has not received a hearing in committee where witnesses could have testified about its effects. It has not gone through the markup process so that the committee of jurisdiction could actually debate and offer amendments to improve it. Moreover, we are about to vote on a bill with several provisions that no one has ever seen before last Wednesday, aside from a small group of Republican offices and special interests that have been working on the bill. Now, this closed-door process not only ignores the changing conditions of drought in California and how the State has already been adapting to meet water conservation needs, but it also ignores all of California’s water provisions that were included, albeit at the last minute, in the WIIN Act last year, which is now Federal law. There has been no discussion, no hearing, no way to know how the provi-sions of this bill that overlap with the enacted law will actually be imple-mented by the Trump administration. This is legislating blind, and it is a bad idea. On some level, I do understand my Republican colleagues’ fear of regular order on this bill. The more sunlight and public scrutiny that this bill gets, the uglier it looks. Make no mistake, if enacted, this bill will hurt a lot of peo-ple. This bill takes water away from fish-ermen, from tribes, the environment, Delta farmers, and others in order to redistribute it primarily to a small group of some of the Nation’s biggest and most politically connected agri-business interests. My Republican colleagues often talk about States’ rights, yet this bill re-peatedly overrides State laws over the objection of that State. I am talking, of course, about California. A letter of opposition to H.R. 23 re-cently came from Governor Jerry Brown, sent to the speaker of the house in the California Congressional Delega-tion attesting to this. Governor Brown writes: ‘‘This bill overrides California water law, ignoring our State’s prerog-ative to oversee our waters. Comman-deering our laws for purposes defined in Washington is not right.’’ This assault on California law and its values are why both California Senator D IANNE FEINSTEIN and Senator K AMALA  H
ARRIS oppose this bill as well. Now, here are just a few examples of the sections in this bill that preempt State law. Section 108(d) begins with the words ‘‘California law is pre-empted’’ on page 21, paragraph 3. That section goes on to remove State protec-tions for certain fisheries. Section 113 of the bill preempts Cali-fornia law that requires the restoration of California’s second longest river and that river’s native salmon runs. Section 108 of the bill tells the State of California that it is barred from managing the State’s water in any way that would ‘‘protect, enhance, or re-store . . . any public trust value.’’ In other words, the broader public inter-est can’t be considered by the State when it is managing the water that be-longs to the people of California. Additionally, this bill eliminates ex-isting fishery protections, which could put many of California’s native fish-eries and the thousands of jobs they support on a path to extinction. That means that this is more than just a California problem, because fishing communities in Oregon and Wash-ington also depend on California salm-on runs. There was a recent UC Davis report that found that if present trends con-tinue, many of California’s salmon runs are on a path to extinction in the decades ahead. This bill would hasten that prediction into reality. This is not just an environmental im-pact. It is a human one as well. We have heard from fishermen who are struggling to pay their mortgages, boats are being scrapped because own-ers can’t pay mooring fees, homes are being repossessed. We have heard about the struggles of small-business owners running restaurants, hotels, and other retail and service businesses. We have also heard from Indian Country, like the Hoopa Valley Tribe that I rep-resent, and others about the danger that this bill poses to tribal fisheries, to tribal water, fishing, property, and other rights. b1645 Rather than simply picking winners and losers, as this destructive bill does, Congress should be working together to grow water supplies for everyone with-out violating Tribal responsibilities or overriding State sovereignty. Congress could be supporting a range of modern water technologies like reuse, desalina-tion, water use efficiency, storm water capture, and groundwater storage and remediation. These are the tools that have increased California’s water sup-plies in recent years and are making our State more drought resilient, but this bill does none of that. These are not controversial sugges-tions working on these modern water supply tools; in fact, it was the rec-lamation commissioner for President George W. Bush who described the water that we could tap through reuse as the next great river of the American

West. We should be focusing on those kind of noncontroversial consensus so-lutions. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. M
CCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. N
UNES ), who has been a leader on this issue for more than two decades. Mr. NUNES. Mr. Chairman, I thank Mr. M
CCLINTOCK for yielding me the time and for his kind words. Mr. Chairman, I am not going to re-spond to the other side of the aisle be-cause some things that are said on this floor are so ridiculous that they don’t deserve a response. So I just want to talk today, Mr. Chairman, about the facts that we face in the San Joaquin Valley. So in the southern and central San Joaquin Valley, we have about 3 mil-lion acres of farm ground, land that is the most fertile farmland in the world—not just in the United States, in the world. We are in danger of losing about a third of that farmland largely because the leftwing government in California has overreached so far that they are now taking away people’s pri-vate property rights. So I want to talk first about our water shortage. So this is the shortage of water that we have in the valley. So it is about 2.6 million acre feet are what we need on average to farm all of the land that we have historically farmed in our area. Now, these are farms that provide food for not only the people of the United States and all over the world but also for the families that work on these farms. So we hear a lot about drought, and we have had supposedly a severe drought, and it was no question a se-vere drought, but what the left con-tinues to not want to talk about is all the water that gets dumped out into the ocean every year. So just from Oc-tober of last year to just a couple days ago, 46 million acre feet of water have gone out to the ocean. So if you go back to the chart I just had, we are only short 2.6 million acre feet. So of the water that has flown into the delta in the middle of California, 92 percent of that water has gone out to the ocean, and it has been wasted. Now, some on the other side of the aisle, they continually talk about glob-al warming, and they continually talk about how the oceans are rising. Well, if you believe the oceans are rising, why would you want more water to flow out into the ocean? I don’t under-stand that. So this is about a million acres of farmland that is going to come out of production if we don’t do anything about it. About 1 million acres over the next decade will begin to come out of production. In fact, some this year is already out of production because none of the water was moved early enough so that it could get to farms in time. So even though we have flooding—so this picture was taken just a couple days ago—this is water spilling over the top of the dam that is going to go all the way out into the ocean and be wasted, for an ocean that supposedly is rising because of global warming. So this is happening because, as Mr. MCCLINTOCK said, we are not building water storage projects. So what this bill does is it reverts back to what the Founding Fathers of our State built, mostly Democrats, by the way. It was Democrats working with the Republicans who built this water system in California. So if we take the existing water system that we have, we add to that four or five facili-ties, like Mr. M
CCLINTOCK is talking about, all the land gets farmed, all the species get saved, everybody goes to work. What you will not hear from the left, and this is very disturbing, I only picked the least disturbing of all the pictures, but I think it is important for people here in Washington and all over the United States to understand this, this is just one family of many of thou-sands of families where their homes ac-tually ran out of water. So this picture is not from Africa, it is not from some-where in Southeast Asia. This is a pic-ture from my area, from my district, from the central and southern San Joa-quin Valley. These are people who are out of water. So the left always talks about want-ing to protect people, wanting people to be able to work, yet we have people with no water in their homes, and yet they are willing to see 92 percent of the water flush right out by the Golden Gate Bridge and be wasted for an ocean that supposedly is filling up. Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may con-sume. We often hear about water that flows through the estuary of California’s Bay-Delta system, we hear that some-times described as wasted. There are some inconvenient facts that we have to bring up when that happens, like the fact that almost all of that water that flows out through the estuary is to pre-vent salt water intrusion so that the State and Federal water pumps aren’t sending salty water to millions of Cali-fornians. That wouldn’t work. In fact, if we shut down all of that outflow that my colleague just mentioned, that is exactly what you would see: massive salt water intrusion and a shutdown of the State and Federal water projects. There is also incredible value in the water that flows through that estuary for downstream communities and farm-ers and senior water right holders, and others who have depended on it for dec-ades. No one understands that better than my colleague who represents some of those communities in the estu-ary, in the delta, M
IKETHOMPSON . Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. T
HOMPSON ). Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this bill, and I rise on behalf of the fisher-men, the landowners, the delta and north-of-delta farmers, the conserva-tionists, the sportsmen, coastal com-munities, the counties in my district, and the water users across our State that will be harmed by this bill. This is a disappointing effort to take care of the San Joaquin Valley’s mas-sive agro businesses at the expense of everyone else. More times than I can count, I have stood on this floor with many of my colleagues from California to explain that our State’s water system is com-plicated. It is because there are hun-dreds of stakeholders. There are dec-ades of rules, laws, and court cases from every level of government and in-dustry that regulate the delivery of water to users across our State. Once again, this body is proposing to end-run that delicate balance to ben-efit one interest. That is wrong. Once again, we are gutting Federal protections for fish and wildlife that support our State’s $3.5 billion hunting and angling industry and our $1.5 bil-lion salmon industry. Once again, we are preempting Cali-fornia laws and regulations, telling States across America that we are okay with the Federal Government un-dermining State and local experts from coast to coast, but this time they are going further. This bill isn’t just about water any-more. It is about giving contractors a pass on their obligations to be good stewards of the resources they are using in the Central Valley of Cali-fornia; it is about reneging on this body’s commitment to the restoration of wildlife and habitat that have suf-fered the consequences of water man-agement plans that already put them last; it is about cutting stakeholders out of the picture and determining win-ners and losers in Federal statute; tak-ing a blunt ax to our State’s water sys-tem over the objections of our Gov-ernor, both of our Senators, and many of our colleagues in the House. This is wrong for California. It won’t alleviate water shortages, but it will kill jobs, and it will ruin drinking water for millions. We need real solutions that are based on sound science and that work for ev-eryone. This bill is not that solution. It is bad for California’s economy, bad for our State sovereignty, and bad for our environment. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no.’’ Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. V
ALADAO ), the author of this legislation. Mr. VALADAO. Mr. Chairman, the first slide that I wanted to present here is one that I think is very important when we talk about water going out into the ocean. The first bar there, the dark blue one, is how much water was flowing through the estuary this past year. The second bar is actually a little bit of an exaggeration. If we took every

single reservoir that we propose in this bill, multiplied it by ten—ten times the amount of storage that we are pro-posing—we still wouldn’t use all that water. There would still be quite a bit of water flowing out into the ocean. So multiply every single project times ten, and we still don’t use up all the water. So there was a lot of water wasted this year alone that we had the oppor-tunity to capture if this bill had been presented earlier or passed into law, and we had the opportunity to actually make a difference. Why does that make a difference to so many folks? It makes a difference because the Central Valley is very im-portant to the country. We feed the Na-tion. When you look at all the different commodities, and this is just a small sample, we produce over 400 different commodities, and a lot of these, a big majority, some of them as much as 99 percent of the different commodities that go through. So everyone sitting at home around the country should pay attention, be-cause this affects their food supply. Even here in the Capitol, when you make yourself a salad at the salad bar, those salads, all those different prod-ucts are produced mostly in the Cen-tral Valley, and so that is why this leg-islation is so important. The reason why it is important to my farmers to get this done, even in a year like this, where we had a 200 percent rainfall, with the amount of water that was flowing through that was, again, in my opinion, wasted, they didn’t find out until it was too late. Planning de-cisions need to be made over at the be-ginning of this when the rain is coming down and they know that the water is there, not in March or in April, because the opportunity has passed. Farmers are very optimistic people. They put stuff in the ground, cover it with dirt, and hope that it will grow so they can feed the world, but having them wait until April to make those decisions to plant those commodities and create those jobs is just way too late. Now, this is the one that I think is the most important. This is Mendota, California. This is a farm worker. This is what happens when we allow water to flow out into the ocean that is wast-ed. People are living in shantytowns. These are people who want to work and people who want to feed the world, peo-ple who want to provide for their own families, and not wait for a check from the government. They just want to know when they are getting their water so that they can start to produce crops and feed the world, but this, be-cause of the policies through Wash-ington, D.C., is what we end up with. Now all the folks who represent parts of my community in different ways, whether it is the water district, city, city councils, county governments, they have all sent in letters in support. I include in the R

Mr. VALADAO. Mr. Chairman, I think we need to have good, sound pol-icy. I think it is time for the Governor and our Senators to play a role in this as well. This bill has been passed. We have gotten some things passed, and I know that my friend across the aisle men-tioned that earlier, but even after the WIIN Act was passed into law, we still had a delay in decisions made, because our farmers had no clue that they were getting their water. So we have to pass legislation like this, this bill right here, and this is what can be helpful for us in the Cen-tral Valley in California and the Na-tion as a whole. Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. M
ATSUI ). Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague for yielding. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposi-tion to H.R. 23. Yet, again, it seems that instead of addressing the issues underlying California’s water supply, some of my colleagues are more inter-ested in fanning the flames of century- old water disputes. The city of Sacramento, which I rep-resent, sits at the confluence of two major rivers, the Sacramento and the American. Because there is no such thing as an average water year in Cali-fornia, living under the threat of drought and flood has become a way of life for Sacramento residents. We are working with the Army Corps to invest billions of dollars in flood protection, and we are collaborating with the Bureau of Reclamation to build a groundwater bank and a water recycling facility to increase access to drinking water. Congress should explore real solu-tions to drought challenges, as the Sac-ramento region is doing. In the short term, we must be effi-cient about fixing leaks and waste while also continuing conservation ef-forts. In the long-term, we should be taking advantage of new technologies to mon-itor our water use and making invest-ments in wastewater cycling in above- and below-ground water storage. Last Congress, I introduced a com-monsense bill that removed barriers to wastewater cycling projects, making it possible for them to move forward more quickly and efficiently with Fed-eral support. It ultimately became law. Yet instead of debating these types of solutions, we are wasting time on a bill that does not solve our underlying water supply problem. b1700 I grew up on a farm in the Central Valley. My father, my uncles, and my grandfather were farmers. We raised peaches, plums, nectarines, and grapes. I recall living and understanding what water means to us, so I do understand the value and sensitivities about water. Now, in the Sacramento region, where I now represent, we have tried to take a balanced approach, working to protect the environment while pro-viding water for our farms and our cit-ies. It is misleading to claim that H.R. 23 will solve our drought problems. This legislation only prioritizes certain re-gions or industries instead of taking the comprehensive approach we need. And by giving the Federal Govern-ment power to dictate the best uses of the State’s water, H.R. 23 sets a disas-trous precedent for other States across the country that should raise alarm on both sides of the aisle. The bill we are discussing today un-dermines a State’s autonomy. Ulti-mately, I am concerned that this bill will weaken environmental protections for the Sacramento-San Joaquin delta, and harm our State’s ability to manage its own water. That is why I join my district and the State of California in strongly op-posing this bill. We cannot afford to

give up California’s right to control its own water future. We must focus on an all-of-the-above strategy that puts us on the path to a sustainable water sup-ply while protecting our environment. Mr. Chairman, I strongly urge my colleagues to reject this legislation. Mr. M
CCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. R
OYCE ). Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Chair-man, the reason we are here today has to do with the drought in California that, frankly, could have been solved had we been allowed to move forward with the storage that we need. Because the process now is one of watching the rains come, watch the water run out to the ocean, and we do not have the abil-ity to block the red tape that prevents us from building the storage that would hold that water so that we can use it during the drought. What was the consequence of us not being able to address that? And why is it so important that we pass the GROW Act here that D
AVID VALADAO from the Central Valley has introduced? Well, the consequences were one of having thousands of jobs disappear. The consequences were having dead crops plowed under in hundreds of thousands of acres of farmland that had been left idle. The consequences were that billions of dollars were lost in the State. And, frankly, the State of California produces 400 commodities that are one-third of the country’s vegetables. It is two-thirds of this country’s fruit. It is two-thirds of the nuts produced. The industry brings in $47 billion. When this happens, the con-sequences are felt by the farmers and by the people across California, by those thrown out of their jobs. This is an incredibly important in-dustry not only in California, but for the entire country. So, for years, we haven’t gotten the water we paid for or contracted for. But not to let us go forward with the additional storage and to put road-blocks in front of that, to absolutely block commonsense solutions, this has got to stop. This is why this legislation needs to be made into law. Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, just to clarify, our environmental laws are not preventing new dams from being built. In fact, the Bureau of Reclama-tion, the GAO, and the Congressional Research Service have looked at this and haven’t been able to identify a sin-gle—nor my colleagues across the aisle have been able to identify a single dam project that somehow was blocked be-cause of environmental laws. What has been stopping many of them—not all, but many of them—has been the financing challenge because many of these projects just don’t make a lot of sense. It is important to realize that projects that do make sense have moved forward. They have secured fi-nancing. They haven’t needed special shortcuts from the environmental laws. And they have happened, projects like Diamond Valley, projects like Los Vaqueros, probably the coming expan-sion of Los Vaqueros. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Cali-fornia (Mr. COSTA ). Mr. COSTA. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding to me. We, in the San Joaquin Valley, know that where food grows, water flows. That is not just a saying; that is the truth. It takes water to grow the food that we rely on to sustain ourselves. Luckily, this year, we have been blessed with an abundance of rain and snow on the mountains—a record year. However, it is only because of the wet-test year in California’s historical record that the agricultural heartland of California, a place where half of our Nation’s fruits and vegetables are grown, is, this year, free from drought. Only 1 year ago, over 83 percent of California was in a moderate drought or worse. We know that the next drought is sure to come, threatening valley families and farm communities. It is either feast or famine. We measure water on 10-year averages. That is why we need solutions that solve this long- term challenge. I commend Congressman V
ALADAO  for continuing this effort. As I noted in a letter I wrote to him in February, though, I have concerns that this legis-lation, without some improvements, will fail to be that long-term solution that the valley and our State so des-perately needs. This solution must be, at the end of the day, multifaceted, must not pick winners and losers, as California water policies in the past have so frequently done, to the det-riment of both the agricultural econ-omy, which we have felt, and Califor-nia’s ecosystems. Sadly, some of the provisions within this legislation, in my opinion, I think fail to meet this test. Language within titles 1 and 3 would pose threats to the wetlands of Grass-lands Ecological Area, the largest wet-lands west of the Mississippi, a vital component of the Pacific Flyway, in an area that contributes nearly $73 mil-lion a year alone to Merced County, which I represent. Section 106 would drastically cut col-lections to the Central Valley Project Restoration Fund, which pays for ref-uge water conveyance—that is very im-portant—and that would transfer over-sight of the fund to other water users. It would also, I think, supersede State laws in some areas that, frankly, over the experience I have had, in many years, will create more problems than it solves. In addition to these concerns, I know from having worked on water solutions for over 30 years that both here and in Sacramento, the only path to legisla-tive success is through bipartisan, bi-cameral action, as we experienced in December with the passage of the WIIN Act that, by the way, authorized four reservoirs that was contained in the WIIN Act that Senator F
EINSTEIN and I and Republicans in the House worked on together in a very constructive way. So, as always, I stand ready to work with my colleagues in both the House and the Senate on a bipartisan basis to improve this legislation and get solu-tions to fix California’s broken water system to the President’s desk. I support moving this legislation for-ward to the Senate. But let’s be clear, this is a work in progress, and much more work remains for this legislation, I think, to be successful. Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. C
AL-
VERT ), the dean of the Republican dele-gation to the House. Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Last winter, two miracles occurred 3,000 miles apart. Here in Washington, our Nation’s Capital, Republicans and Democrats came together and passed a significant water bill that was signed into law. Back in California, we saw massive amounts of rainfall that came down in our drought-stricken State, quickly filling our depleted reservoirs. But I think we can actually take an-other big step forward by passing H.R. 23, the GROW Act. This bill before us provides even more long-term water so-lutions for California by expediting the consideration of feasibility studies for water storage projects that have lan-guished for periods of time that are longer than it took to actually build the Hoover Dam. The GROW Act also includes provisions that are critical to the Bay-Delta operations and help im-prove water reliability. Last year, Mr. Chairman, you heard a lot of doomsday predictions from cer-tain groups that said the language we passed would push threatened species towards extinction. That did not hap-pen. Today you hear a lot of the same talk. But solutions to H.R. 23 are com-mon sense and will bring reliability to the water supply of California. Mr. Chairman, I encourage a ‘‘yes’’ vote. Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. M
CNERNEY ). Mr. M
CNERNEY. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Chairman, we see this bill every Congress. That is, every 2 years we fight this thing out. Let’s talk about what it would do. It would weaken the Endangered Species Act—that has been a target of the Re-publican Party for decades. It will ben-efit one region while harming another. It will make a few people very wealthy. It will likely cause additional drainage problems for the Westlands and other water districts. It will cause ocean salt water to come farther inland in the California delta, poisoning farmland, destroying marinas, disrupting water supplies for cities along the delta, basi-cally destroying the delta as we now know it. It will use precious limited water to plant evermore thirsty or-chards in the desert. And it may expe-dite the creation of new dams with weakened environmental control.

So let’s look at what it won’t do. It won’t create any new water. So why do we have to go through this every 2 years? It is good political theater for some colleagues, but it is not going to get through the Senate. But all may not be lost. Here is a novel suggestion: work across party lines, work across northern versus southern California lines, and come to a compromise that will actually create new water and take all stakeholder in-terests into account. We need to take a holistic approach. It means actually funding recycling and above- and below-ground water storage that makes environmental sense. It means capturing stormwater, early leak detection, data collection, efficiency, and conservation. It is all of these things, all of which can be done in a cost-effective way that prepares us for the long-term. There are countless recharge, recy-cling, desalinization projects, as well as other storage projects that are ready to go and could create or save enough water for thousands of families in California. Instead of considering a bill that wastes water and that California op-poses, we should be discussing how to most efficiently utilize the rain and snowpack we have, which can be done while protecting the environment. Let’s oppose this bill and start work-ing on legislation that can be signed into law and benefit everyone. Mr. M
CCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. G
OSAR ), the chairman of the bipartisan Western Caucus. Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 23, leg-islation sponsored by my good friend and Western Caucus member, D
AVID V
ALADAO . For years, Western communities have suffered as a result of frivolous lawsuits, inefficient policies, and bur-densome regulations that have pre-vented adoption of commonsense water solutions. These factors, coupled with a lack of rainfall, exacerbated a man-made drought that lasted for 5 years. Rather than capturing precious water supplies, failed government poli-cies that refused to put Americans first allowed billions of gallons to be fun-neled into the San Francisco Bay and Pacific Ocean. These deliberate diver-sions killed thousands of jobs, harmed our country’s food supply, and led to local unemployment levels as high as 40 percent. Today we have an opportunity to right these wrongs by passing the GROW Act, legislation that is sup-ported by approximately 100 different cities, agriculture groups, water asso-ciations, irrigation districts, local chambers of commerce, and businesses throughout the country. Most of the major provisions in this bill have been passed by this body nu-merous times. In fact, we have been working to enact similar legislation for nearly 5 years. For example, title V includes West-ern Caucus member TOMMCCLINTOCK ’s Water Supply Permitting Coordination Act, an excellent bill that will stream-line the permitting process for impor-tant water storage projects. Title VI includes Western Caucus member D
ANNEWHOUSE ’s Bureau of Reclamation Water Project Stream-lining Act, much-needed legislation that will result in increased storage of surface water. Title VII includes Western Caucus Vice Chairman T
IPTON ’s Water Rights Protection Act, an essential bill that protects private water rights from Fed-eral takings. I strongly support these titles and the underlying bill. It is far past time that we put our communities, families, and America first. H.R. 23 addresses previous policy fail-ures and adopts worthwhile water poli-cies that will benefit future genera-tions. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from California for sponsoring this much-needed legislation, and I urge my colleagues to vote in support of this commonsense bill. Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I want to briefly respond to my friend’s reference to a manmade drought. What California just went through is what hydrologists, scientists, and his-torians tell us is the most significant drought the State has ever experi-enced—a natural one. I certainly knew that human activities were impacting the climate, but, wow, if human beings could actually cause the snowpack to be 5 percent of normal and cause a drought like that, that is taking human-induced climate change to a whole new level. We have got to be careful in this debate. We are begin-ning to give hyperbole a bad name. b1715 Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. G
ARAMENDI ), representing the Sac-ramento Valley. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chairman, we have a serious case of legislative amne-sia here. Apparently, the sponsors of this bill and those who are speaking in support of it have totally forgotten what we did last year. The WIIN Act last year addressed every single prob-lem that has been presented here this afternoon: new reservoirs, four were authorized in the WIIN Act, which be-came law less than a year ago—7 months, to be exact; all of the issues of the outflows of water to the delta were addressed so that additional export of water from the delta could occur. I am wondering: What are we doing here with this piece of legislation, aside from totally eviscerating the pro-tections for the largest estuary on the West Coast, of the Western Hemi-sphere? The environmental protections are eviscerated. What are we doing with this legisla-tion besides—oh, you wanted to talk about private water rights? Those pri-vate water rights are set in place by the laws of the State of California, which are overridden by this piece of legislation. Yes, that is true. This legislation re-moves the water rights that the State of California has given to individuals as well as irrigation districts, but they are stripped away. What is this all about? Last year, a 2-year effort was com-pleted and the WIIN Act was passed by this Congress, signed into law. It is in existence. Reservoirs can be built. Water conservation will take place. All of the things that we need to do are in place today. So why are we fighting this fight? Because we don’t know how to stop fighting? Because we don’t know how to actually implement a law that we passed last year? And, by the way, where is the funding for all you want to do here? There is no money in this. You want to do these things. You want water; you want res-ervoirs—put up the money. Don’t just sit here and regurgitate what we have done for the last 5 years and totally ig-nore the progress that was made with the WIIN legislation. We ought not do this. I am opposed to this, and, hopefully, we will find some sensible action. Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. T
IPTON ). Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Chairman, I would like to be able to address title VII of the Water Rights Protection Act in this bill. Over many decades, Federal attempts to manipulate Federal permit, lease, and land management process to cir-cumvent long-established State water law and hijack privately held water rights have sounded the alarm for all non-Federal water users that rely on these water rights for their livelihood. The Federal Government’s overreach and infringement on private property rights that led to the introduction of this original bill in the 113th Congress involved the U.S. Forest Service’s at-tempt to require the transfer of pri-vately held water rights to the Federal Government as a permit condition on National Forest System lands. With this permit condition, there is no com-pensation for the transfer of these pri-vately held rights. This Forest Service permit condition has already hurt a number of stake-holders in my home State of Colorado, including Powderhorn Ski Area in Grand Junction and the Breckenridge Ski Resort. The same nefarious tactic has been used in Utah, Nevada, and other Western States, where agencies have required the surrender of posses-sion of water rights in exchange for ap-proving the conditional use of grazing allotments. This Federal water grab has broad implications that have begun to extend beyond the recreation and the farming and ranching community and are now threatening municipalities and other businesses.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H5509 July 12, 2017 
In 2014, the Forest Service proposed a groundwater directive that would have expanded the agency’s reach over groundwater and established new bu-reaucratic hurdles to interfere with private water users’ ability to be able to access their water. Though the For-est Service ultimately withdrew this controversial groundwater directive, there are no guarantees that the direc-tive or something similar won’t be back in the future. The Water Rights Protection Act of-fers a sensible approach that preserves water rights and the ability to be able to develop water requisite to living in the arid West without interfering with water allocations for non-Federal par-ties or allocations that protect an envi-ronment that is cherished by all West-erners. I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues from other Western States to ensure that no State-recog-nized water right goes unprotected from the class of actions that this bill prohibits. I appreciate the inclusion of this leg-islation and encourage its passage. Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. B
ERA), my colleague from the Sacramento area. Mr. BERA. Mr. Chairman, here we go again. Today, we are debating a bill that many of my California colleagues and I have opposed time and time again on this House floor. This bill allows Washington, D.C., politicians to pick winners and losers when it comes to California’s water. Now, that is not right. This is a par-tisan bill that is opposed by both Cali-fornia Senators as well as our Gov-ernor. Now, California water is complicated. It is a lot more complicated than healthcare. But it should be up to Cali-fornians to kind of decide how to use our water, what we ought to do with that water. Water is incredibly critical to our State. This isn’t about picking winners and losers. When we think about water, we have certainly got to have storage, we certainly know we are going to have conveyance, but we have got to do this in a California way. Unfortunately, H.R. 23 is going to pit northern California against southern California while overriding California’s own State laws. The bill is also going to gut environmental protections and threaten the critical Bay-Delta eco-system. I fish on the Sacramento River, and salmon fishing is incredibly important to the State of California as well as the States to the north of us. This bill is not going to be a good bill. It is going to devastate the fishing industry. We also have to think about drinking water for northern California. Folsom Dam is in my district and Folsom Lake is in my district. It pro-vides not only flood protection, but Folsom Lake provides surface drinking water for a lot of my constituents. We tried to put a simple amendment in here that would actually protect the quality of that drinking water. Unfor-tunately, H.R. 23 would mandate pump-ing levels that could negatively impact the Folsom Reservoir water supply. That is going to place many of my con-stituents at risk. This isn’t a good bill. Let’s kill this bill. Let’s step back. Let Californians decide the best way to handle Cali-fornia water. That is what we ought to do. Again, this bill is dramatic over-reach. It is the Federal Government stepping into something that the State should actually decide. I hope my col-leagues will join me in opposing this bill. Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. R
OHRABACHER ). Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 23. Today we have seen pictures, horrible pictures of some of the best agricul-tural land in the world that has been totally destroyed by the policies of people who are now claiming that they like the environment too much and that that should have, perhaps, some-thing more to do with their decision-making than what benefits people. Well, what happened is we have turned one of the most productive food-pro-ducing areas of the world into a catas-trophe, a desert that produces nothing. And who has been in charge of this? Who has been in charge of seeing this total destruction of what could be a garden for the people of the world? It has been, yes, the Obama administra-tion appointees for the last year and, yes, in California, where we have had a leftwing liberal Democratic adminis-tration appointing radical environ-mentalists the same way Obama ap-pointed radical environmentalists to determine policy. And what does that mean to us? It means there is less food being pro-duced. It means we have turned produc-tive land into a horrible desert that even animals can’t exist upon. No, it makes a lot of sense right now. What makes sense is that now we have gone through this drought and seen this destruction that didn’t need to happen. What we need to do is build dams. What we need to do is to make sure that the water that we now have is being stored properly so that the people of our State don’t suffer, so that wealth that can be grown from the land in central California, which used to be the world’s breadbasket, that that wealth doesn’t just disappear from the face of the planet. No, you can’t really love nature un-less you also love people, and right now the people of California deserve to have some planning done about storing water when we have it rather than suf-fering and having this type of destruc-tion during our droughts. Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may con-sume. Responding briefly to a bit of hyper-bole just now that somehow environ-mental laws have created a ‘‘desert that produces nothing in California,’’ we do need to remember the facts. The truth is, even through this his-toric drought, farm employment rose statewide each year during the drought. The agricultural economy is thriving, and, thankfully, this year, even the most junior Federal contrac-tors are enjoying a 100 percent alloca-tion. They are fully realizing the vision of being the breadbasket of this coun-try and the world. It is hardly a desert that produces nothing. With that, I do need to contrast what has been happening on the other end of the system, many of the communities I represent, where fishing communities really do have nothing. The California salmon season this year will be little or nothing. The Yurok Tribe that I represent that is de-pendent on fisheries, salmon fisheries in California since long before there was agriculture, will, for the second year in a row, close its Tribal fishery. We are seeing folks selling their boats. We are seeing fishing communities im-pacted in dramatic ways. There is real genuine hardship, much like what was just described by my friend. So the facts do matter. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. M
CCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Bakersfield, California (Mr. M
CCARTHY ), the majority leader. Mr. M
CCARTHY. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I thank him for his work when it comes to water in California. Mr. Chairman, water is not optional, not in my district, not in California, not anywhere. But over the past 5 years, my constituents have struggled to survive without life-giving water in the face of a catastrophic drought. This past winter, heavy rains and snowfall have brought much-needed re-lief. In fact, there was so much water this past winter we ran out of room to store it. But we cannot always expect a year to bring monsoon-level rains and record snow. What happens if next year’s rain and snowfall is average, or below average, or we have another drought? The Federal and State regula-tions that keep us from pumping and storing water will come back to haunt us. The water bill passed by this body and signed into law last year was a downpayment on California’s future. Today’s legislation is another major investment in our State’s future. So let’s look at pumping. There is no reason—absolutely no reason—we should prioritize potential benefit to fish over real benefits to families. This legislation increases delta pumping and will bring immediate relief to two- thirds of California south of the delta. But a long-term solution demands more pumping. While California’s pop-ulation has doubled since the 1970s, we

haven’t completed a single major stor-age project in that time. Now, that is worth restating. While California’s population has doubled since the 1970s, we have not completed a single major storage project in that time. How can California grow and thrive in the future if we depend on in-adequate infrastructure from nearly 50 years ago? Currently, five reservoir projects have been stalled in regulatory and red tape for decades. If these reservoirs alone are built, we could store between 1 to 1.5 million acre-feet of additional water in our State. So we need to build more storage as soon as possible. Last year’s water bill jumpstarted the process for building new reservoirs in California and the West. It was a bi-partisan bill, with the vote being hun-dreds of votes out of the House, more than 70 in the Senate. Today’s legislation builds on that by requiring the Federal Government to finally finish the feasibility studies for the five storage projects in California. Then we reform the permitting process so other projects aren’t held up for years trying to get approval from a dozen different agencies. So I want to thank Congressman D
AVID VALADAO for his hard work, his persistence on this issue. Ultimately, American citizens haven’t gotten the water they need because their govern-ment was failing them. Last year’s bill was the start to change all that. Today, we take another major step to bring our communities the water they contract and pay for. b1730 Now, Mr. Chairman, you are going to hear a lot of people on this side of the aisle talk about the need from Cali-fornia. Unfortunately, on the other side of the aisle, it looks like you will just hear from one. That should show you the need and desire of why this bill is so important. Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may con-sume. Mr. Chairman, this debate is causing the fact checking machines to melt down, unfortunately. We just heard that there hasn’t been a single major storage project in California since the 1970s. That is going to come as shock-ing news to the folks of the Metropoli-tan Water District which completed a huge storage project, Diamond Valley, during that period. It will certainly surprise the folks in Contra Costa, which completed Los Vaqueros without any special environmental shortcuts and with their own financing for the most part. It will surprise local water districts around the State, including my own Marin Municipal Water Dis-trict, which completed two dam expan-sion projects in that same timeframe. It will surprise the folks at the current and semitropic groundwater banks that expanded significantly groundwater storage during that timeframe. In fact, the truth is, California has added nearly 6 million acre feet of new storage, surface and groundwater stor-age, over the past few decades in this timeframe we have been talking about. So facts really do matter. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. M
IMIWALTERS ). Mrs. MIMI WALTERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 23, the GROW Act, which makes important and necessary regulatory re-forms to allow for better management of water resources throughout the West. My home State of California recently suffered its worst drought on record, which significantly affected the entire State. Families, communities, work-ers, and businesses all made significant sacrifices to conserve water and miti-gate the drought’s impact. I applaud the water agencies and residents in my home district of Or-ange County for taking the necessary steps to adapt to the severe drought conditions. While substantial rainfall this winter effectively ended Califor-nia’s drought, the recent crisis was not just from a lack of rain. It is also the result of failed State and Federal poli-cies that have mismanaged critical water resources throughout the West. The GROW Act is a crucial step to-ward addressing these failed policies. H.R. 23 will help California recover from this devastating drought and en-sure the State is better equipped to handle future water deficiencies. In addition to addressing water deliv-ery and water rights issues, the bill also facilitates the development of new water storage projects, which is a key water management tool for southern California water agencies. These projects are critical to a number of California communities, like Orange County, that lack the access to water even during nondrought conditions. The GROW Act removes regulatory barriers from streamlining the permit-ting and approval process for new in-frastructure projects. Under current law, new water storage construction projects require approval from a number of Federal, State, and local agencies. This bill provides for a consolidated permitting process that would require Federal agencies to con-duct coordinated reviews of non-Fed-eral storage projects. The GROW Act will also expedite fea-sibility studies for much-needed Fed-eral storage projects, some of which have been unnecessarily delayed for years. Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I re-serve the balance of my time. Mr. M
CCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. K
NIGHT ). Mr. KNIGHT. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 23, the Gaining Responsibility on Water Act, or GROW Act, which I am a proud cosponsor. This bill takes an important step in protecting the water security of Cali-fornians and the food supply integrity of the United States. As all of my colleagues from Cali-fornia know, the recent Western drought nearly crippled our State’s ag-riculture industry and compromised the standard of living for all our con-stituents by raising prices at the gro-cery stores throughout the country. Mr. Chairman, while we can’t control the weather, we can take steps to miti-gate its potentially harmful effects. I always like it when people say: Can we just scrap the bill? Or can we start over? Or can we work together on that? That is just code for: please stop talking about water; please stop bring-ing issues to the floor where we can fix something. And that is what we hear today quite frequently. One of the most baffling facets of this story is the fact that there were read-ily available water sources that could have been utilized but were held up by outdated regulations and red tape. Al-though we have received some relief from the drought this year, it would be a disgrace for us as lawmakers not to learn from this ordeal. Mr. Chairman, we are blessed to live in the most developed Nation in the world where Americans only notice the absence of basic necessities, as opposed to other nations where people are found wanting of them. Unfortunately, due to the misguided policies of the past, that is the situa-tion so many families and businesses find themselves in. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank my friend Mr. VALADAO for his continued leadership on this issue, and I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 23. Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I re-serve the balance of my time. Mr. M
CCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may con-sume. Mr. Chairman, I think it is time to fact check the fact checker. The last major reservoir of over a million acre feet was in 1979. It was in New Melones, 2.3 million acre feet. The two reservoirs that the gentleman ref-erenced combined are less than a mil-lion acre feet. They would fill New Melones to less than half of that amount. With respect to water salinity, the Bay-Delta Accord, that is codified by this bill, guarantees the water nec-essary to combat salt water intrusion. And finally, I would point out that, no, dams don’t create water. Nature creates water. Dams store that water from wet years so that we have plenty of it in dry years. That is where we have fallen a generation behind in our needs precisely because of the laws that the gentleman from California doggedly defends. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may con-sume. Mr. Chairman, I do appreciate the re-definition of ‘‘major water storage

projects.’’ It is not a definition that I think is recognized anywhere else other than just now on this floor, but I appreciate it. Mr. Chair, there are many problems with this bill, and I do want to urge my colleagues to oppose it. I can’t keep track of the number of times the State of California has come up in our debate here these last several minutes. So let’s look to the State of California and see what the State of California says about this bill. The Governor of the State of Cali-fornia opposes it in a hard-hitting let-ter that went out to the California del-egation and others just a few days ago. The new attorney general of California, Xavier Becerra, wrote an equally crit-ical letter opposing this bill. Both U.S. Senators from California oppose this bill. It is going nowhere in the Senate and will not become law because of funda-mental flaws that have been brought up each of the past several years that this bill has been introduced in this Congress. It overrides California State sov-ereignty and State water laws in ways that are unacceptable to the people of California and to the government of California. So when we keep bringing up California, let’s just be very clear that California doesn’t want this bill. California opposes this bill. Now, I represent the downstream end of some of these water systems that we are talking about. When we talk about people and fish and jobs, it is impor-tant to remember that fishing jobs matter, too. In the communities that I represent, and also communities throughout Oregon and Washington that depend on California salmon runs, they are hurting. This summer we are going to prob-ably see a closure, for all intents and purposes, of the commercial salmon season. We are certainly going to see a closure of the Yurok Tribal Salmon Fishery for the second year in a row. That is not only economically dev-astating to Tribal communities that I represent, it has an emotional impact as well. These are communities that are hurting. In fact, the Yurok are re-porting suicide rates among young peo-ple that are alarmingly high. The clo-sure of this sacred fishery that is their grocery store, that is a sacred part of their existence, is certainly not going to help, and I think could very well contribute to the very severe problems that they are experiencing. Fishing jobs matter, the environment matters, downstream communities that depend on this water that would be redistributed and reallocated by Congress through this short-sighted bill, that all matters, too. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose this wrong-headed bill, and I urge my colleagues across the aisle to do what we have been inviting them to do each of the past several years, and that is to reach across the aisle on bi-partisan, commonsense water solu-tions. There is a lot that we could do together. Many of my colleagues served with me in the California State legisla-ture. They know, because we did it to-gether, that there is a different way. There is a better way. We were able to pass landmark, bi-partisan water legislation during our time together in Sacramento, and we did it because we didn’t try to pick winners and losers. We found all sorts of low-hanging fruit and consensus so-lutions, and we came up with some-thing that was supported across party lines, and in every region of the State. We can do that here, too, but we won’t do it through this bill. Mr. Chairman, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. M
CCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. Abundance or shortage, that is the question. And I want to thank and sa-lute Mr. V
ALADAO for his work on this issue and for putting that choice so clearly before the House today. It is true, we can choose to continue down this sad road that we have been on. That means increasingly severe government-induced shortages. It means higher and higher water and grocery prices and a permanently de-clining quality of life for our children who will be required to stretch and ra-tion every drop of water in their bleak and parched homes. With this bill, we choose a different future. We choose abundance. We choose a future in which water flows again to the fertile fields of the Central Valley, providing full employment for families and affordable groceries from America’s agricultural cornucopia. It is a future in which families need not watch their gardens shrivel and die, and towns and cities need not fear mandatory water rationing and uncer-tain and unpredictable supplies. It is a future in which long-estab-lished water rights are safe and secure from the whims of politicians and bu-reaucrats. We choose a future in which thriving populations of young salmon can swim to the sea unmolested by the non-native predators that now kill 90 percent of them before they reach the ocean; a future in which new fish hatcheries assure the release of mil-lions of additional salmon to supply a revived and rapidly expanding commer-cial fishing industry. We choose a future in which great new reservoirs can store vast amounts of water in wet years to assure abun-dance in dry ones; a future in which families can enjoy the prosperity that abundant water and hydroelectricity and affordable groceries provide, and the quality of life that comes from that prosperity. Abundance or shortage? That is the question. We choose abun-dance. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-ance of my time. Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Chair, I rise in strong op-position to H.R. 23 because it upends dec-ades of State and federal water law and need-lessly pits water users against one another. On the heels of the worst drought in Califor-nia’s history, this bill mandates that certain in-terests come out ahead of others. California has just recently emerged from six years of a punishing drought that forced every resident to conserve water, caused mil-lions of acres of agricultural land to be fallowed, and dramatically increased our State’s risk of major wildfires. The drought was a massive disaster and Congress should respond by investing in long-term resilience against future droughts such as water con-servation, recycling, groundwater recharge, and desalination. What Congress should not be doing is using the drought as an excuse to permanently upend a century of water law and countless protections for threatened and en-dangered wildlife. H.R. 23 weakens or overrides decades of State and federal law, including the State and federal Endangered Species Acts; the National Environmental Policy Act; the Central Valley Project Improvement Act; and the San Joaquin River Settlement Act. This list should set off alarm bells for any proponent of States’ rights or cooperative federalism. For over a century, the Federal Government has deferred to State water law whenever possible. The GROW Act unwinds that history entirely. By discarding a century of water law and species protections, this bill will decimate the San Francisco Bay-Delta ecosystem, drive the Delta smelt to extinction, and accelerate the decline of the wild salmon and steelhead runs which have been an important part of the Northern California economy since the mid- 19th century. This irresponsible bill also overrides science-based management of the delicate Delta infrastructure and would gut several of our most bedrock environmental laws. For these reasons I strongly oppose this legisla-tion and I urge my colleagues to join me in voting no. The Acting CHAIR (Mr. H
ILL). All time for general debate has expired. Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment under the 5- minute rule.

(a) P URPOSE AND FINDINGS .— (1) P
URPOSE AND FINDINGS .—Section 10002 of the San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement Act (Public Law 111–11) is amended to read as follows: 
‘‘SEC. 10002. PURPOSE AND FINDINGS. 
‘‘(a) P URPOSE .—The purpose of this part is to authorize implementation of the Settlement. ‘‘(b) F
INDINGS .—Congress finds that since the date of the enactment of this Act, the following conditions now persist with regard to implemen-tation of the Settlement: ‘‘(1) Millions of dollars of economic damages have occurred due to seepage from rivers flows and other impacts to third parties affected by the Settlement and San Joaquin River Restora-tion Program and such impacts will continue for the duration of the Settlement and Restoration Program implementation. ‘‘(2) Estimated costs of implementing the Set-tlement have more than doubled from the initial estimates for implementing the Settlement, from a high-end estimate of $800,000,000 to more than $1,700,000,000, due to unrealistic initial cost esti-mates, additional, unanticipated cost increases related to damages to land from seepage and to infrastructure from subsidence, and from in-creased construction costs to complete channel improvements, and other improvements not originally identified, but anticipated in the Set-tlement as necessary to implement the Restora-tion Goal. ‘‘(3) Achievement of the Settlement’s Water Management Goal, to reduce or avoid water supply impacts to Friant Division long-term contractors, including the Friant-Kern Canal and Madera Canal capacity restoration projects have not progressed and are likely impossible given available and likely future funding and regulatory constraints. ‘‘(4) Implementation of the Settlement’s Res-toration Goal has already fallen short of the schedule agreed to by the Settling Parties and Congress, which required the reintroduction of Spring-run and Fall-run Chinook salmon in the river by December 31, 2012, and the majority of Paragraph 11 improvements construction to be complete by December 31, 2013, with the remain-der of the paragraph (11) improvements to be completed by December 31, 2016, neither of which deadlines have been met and the Sec-retary has now made findings that such im-provements will not be completed until 2030 at the earliest and likely beyond that timeframe, which schedule assumes full funding of the Res-toration Program, which has not occurred. ‘‘(5) Catastrophic species declines in the Sac-ramento-San Joaquin Delta and other changed conditions have affected the Friant Division’s water supply in ways unimagined during the time of the Settlement’s signing, resulting in ad-ditional reductions in water supply for the Friant Division beyond what was agreed to in the Settlement. ‘‘(6) Recent scientific assessments of likely fu-ture climate change suggest that no amount of additional flow in the San Joaquin River will sustain Spring-run Chinook salmon, one of the target species for maintaining a self-sustaining population below Friant Dam. ‘‘(7) In consideration of existing conditions, it is not reasonable, prudent and feasible to imple-ment the Settlement as originally authorized.’’. (2) DEFINITIONS .—Section 10003 of the San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement Act (Pub-lic Law 111–11) is amended by adding at the end the following: ‘‘(4) The term ‘Exchange Contractors’ means San Joaquin River Exchange Contractors Water Authority, whose members are the Central Cali-fornia Irrigation District, Columbia Canal Com-pany, the Firebaugh Canal Water District, and the San Luis Canal Company. ‘‘(5) The term ‘Governor’ means the Governor of the State of California. ‘‘(6) The term ‘Gravelly Ford’ means the Grav-elly Ford gaging station in the San Joaquin River located at approximately River Mile 230. ‘‘(7) The term ‘Restoration Area’ means the San Joaquin River between Friant Dam and the Merced River confluence, and generally within 1,500 feet of the centerline of the river. ‘‘(8) The term ‘Restoration Flow’ means the hydrograph flows (as provided in paragraph 18 and exhibit B of the Settlement), buffer flows of up to 10 percent of the applicable hydrograph flows, and any additional water acquired by the Secretary of the Interior from willing sellers to meet the Restoration Goal of the Settlement. ‘‘(9) The term ‘Restoration Fund’ means that fund established by this part. ‘‘(10) The term ‘Sack Dam’ means a low-head earth and concrete structure with wooden flap gates that diverts San Joaquin River flows into the Arroyo Canal at approximately River Mile 182.1. ‘‘(11) The term ‘Warm Water Fishery’ means a water system that has an environment suitable for species of fish other than salmon (including any subspecies) and trout (including all sub-species). ‘‘(12) The term ‘third party’ means the Ex-change Contractors or any member thereof, cur-rent or former members of the San Joaquin Trib-utaries Authority, and current or former mem-bers of the San Luis and Delta Mendota Water Authority.’’; and (3) I

‘‘(2) C ONDITIONS FOR RELEASE .—The Secretary is authorized to release Flows— ‘‘(A) if all improvements and mitigation meas-ures are completed or implemented, including all actions necessary to mitigate impacts on land-owners, water agencies, and water users; and ‘‘(B) if such Flows will not exceed existing downstream channel capacities. ‘‘(3) S
EEPAGE IMPACTS .—(A) The Secretary, in implementing this Act, shall not cause material adverse impacts to third parties. The Secretary shall reduce Flows to the extent necessary to address any material adverse impacts to third parties from groundwater seepage or levee insta-bility caused by such flows identified based on the monitoring program of the Secretary. Not-withstanding the foregoing, the Secretary shall not directly or indirectly cause groundwater to rise above 10 feet below ground surface and shall provide at least 10 feet below ground sur-face as a minimum threshold elevation for groundwater beneath any fields where perma-nent or other deep rooted crops are grown, and at least 6 feet below ground surface as a min-imum threshold elevation for groundwater be-neath any fields where annual or shallow root-ed crops are grown. These minimum thresholds shall be adjusted yearly based upon information provided by individual landowners regarding the minimum threshold that they will need in order to grow their crop(s) that year. If during the course of the year the landowner informs the Secretary that detrimental seepage is being experienced or is reasonably likely to occur de-spite the adherence to the minimum threshold, the Secretary shall reduce Restoration Flows to a volume sufficient to reduce seepage impacts by reducing the occurrence of groundwater to a non-damaging level below ground surface. ‘‘(B) If Flow reduction alone is not sufficient to mitigate for seepage impacts the Secretary shall mitigate by real estate transaction or in-stallation of physical measures, whichever op-tion is requested by the landowner. ‘‘(C) Any water that seeps onto private prop-erty shall thereupon become the property of that landowner if the landowner takes control of the water including by re-diverting it to the San Joaquin River. If seepage water is returned to the San Joaquin River it shall meet applicable water quality requirements. ‘‘(4) T
EMPORARY FISH BARRIER PROGRAM .— Using funds otherwise available from the San Joaquin River Restoration Fund if necessary, the Secretary is authorized to make improve-ments to the Hills Ferry Barrier or any replace-ment thereof in order to prevent upstream mi-gration of any protected species to the restora-tion area. The Secretary is further authorized to work with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife for the improvement or replacement of the Hills Ferry Barrier in order to prevent the upstream migration of any protected species. If third parties south of the confluence with the Merced River are required to install their screens or fish bypass facilities in order to com-ply with the Endangered Species Act of 1973, the Secretary shall bear the costs of such screens or facilities, except to the extent that such costs are already or are further willingly borne by the State of California or by the third parties. Ex-penditures by Reclamation are non-reimburs-able. Any protected species recovered at the Hills Ferry Barrier or in the Restoration Area or any river or false pathways thereto that is to be relocated outside of the Restoration Area shall only be relocated to an area where there is an established self-sustaining population of that same genotype or phenotype.’’; and (D) by amending subsection (j) to read as fol-lows: ‘‘(j) S

IMITATION .—Except as provided in the Settlement, to the extent that costs incurred solely to implement this Settlement would not otherwise have been incurred by any entity or public or local agency or subdivision of the State of California, such costs shall not be borne by any such entity, agency, or subdivision of the State of California, unless such costs are in-curred on a voluntary basis. Any appropriations by Congress to implement this part shall be on the basis of line item authorizations and appro-priations and shall not be part of the pro-grammatic funding for the Secretary or the Bu-reau of Reclamation.’’; and (B) by striking subsection (f) and inserting the following: ‘‘(f) R
EACH 4B.—No Restoration Flows re-leased shall be routed through section 4B of the San Joaquin River. The Secretary shall seek to make use of modified and/or existing conveyance facilities such as flood control channels in order to provide conveyance for the restoration flows. Congress finds that such use of multi-use facili-ties is more economical and cost-effective than seeking to restore certain sections of the San Joaquin River. The Secretary shall provide non- reimbursable funding for the incremental in-crease in maintenance costs for use of the flood control channels. ‘‘(g) N
OIMPACT ON WATER SUPPLIES .—Re-in- troduction or migration of species to the San Joaquin River upstream of the confluence with the Merced River made possible by or aided by the existence of restoration flows or any im-provements to the river made hereunder shall not result in water supply reductions, addi-tional storage releases, or bypass flows on un-willing third parties due to such re-introduc-tion. ‘‘(h) N
OTRANSFERENCE OF LIABILITY .—Con- gress finds that the Federal interest in the res-toration of the San Joaquin River upstream of the confluence with the Merced River has been satisfied with regard to the development of the Friant Division, Delta Mendota canal, the con-tinued performance of and compliance with the terms of agreements of the United States to pur-chase water rights and for exchange of water, its Agreements with the entities that comprise the Exchange Contractors to deliver their water rights in the San Joaquin River pursuant to the terms of the agreements. The enactment of the San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement Act, together with findings in this legislation includ-ing the Settling Parties and agencies of the State of California tried to implement the Res-toration Program for ten years and the Bureau of Reclamation has stated it will take at least another 15 years to implement assuming full funding is provided, even though that full fund-ing has never been provided since the Settlement was executed or the Restoration Act enacted, and that absent implementation of that funding, there is no possibility of establishing a viable self-sustaining salmonid population and the res-toration of the upper San Joaquin River has proven infeasible on terms originally conceived by the parties to the Settlement and Congress in the Restoration Act. Therefore, notwithstanding that the United States and water users and agencies within the Friant Division are released of any existing or future obligations with regard to the Restoration Program, or any similar pro-gram, no responsibility for achieving the goals of the Restoration Program, including the provi-sion of flows and the re-introduction of salmon, or other fish species to the San Joaquin River, shall be imposed on the United States, upon the Exchange Contractors or any of its members nor shall the rights to delivery of water reserved to the Exchange Contractors by any agency of the

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 431, the gentleman from California (Mr. L
AMALFA ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. Mr. L
AMALFA. Mr. Chair, I thank Mr. M
CCLINTOCK for managing this bill and for his help on this. I am pleased to support the bill, the GROW Act, which, contrary to some claims, protects northern California water rights and keeps more water in the north than the status quo. I should know because I represent the source of the overwhelming majority of Califor-nia’s usable water. The underlying bill improves water efficiency by allowing junior water contractors in the Sacramento Valley to carry over water supplies from one year to the next in Lake Shasta, re-taining access to those supplies the fol-lowing year, which promotes efficiency when you are banking that additional water for future use. This amendment improves the bill by ensuring that all Federal water con-tractors in the Sacramento Valley have the same ability to reschedule their water supplies. Mr. Chair, under the current system, water contractors are forced to use it or lose it. If water allocations are not fully used each year, the ability to ac-cess that water is lost. Now, around Washington, D.C., that use-it-or-lose-it attitude usually means a lot of money that sits in certain agencies’ bank accounts or in their pots, it is just used up. Why would we want to do that kind of thing with water? We need to be banking it and saving it, where practical, to be usable in the next year or to pass to others who could use it as well. During wet years, farms and ranches may choose to reschedule a portion of their water for the following year. This bill and this amendment will signifi-cantly improve planning and delivery of water supplies by ensuring max-imum flexibility, flexibility which we need, and allowing water to be accessed when it is needed most. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 min-utes. Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I also represent northern California. My friend, Mr. LAMALFA , just said that this bill fully protects northern Cali-fornia’s water. Well, we represent the two districts right next to each other that are the northernmost districts in California, and I can tell you, my part of northern California doesn’t do so well under this bill. In fact, the only way we have been able to prevent a repeat of a cata-strophic fish kill disaster in the Klam-ath River system each of the last sev-eral years has been by releasing cold water in the Trinity River, which is a major tributary to the lower Klamath River. That has been a lifesaver for the communities downstream that depend on those salmon runs. This bill would legislatively prohibit the Bureau of Reclamation from ever doing that again. So this is not a bill that is good for northern California, certainly, my part of northern California. And I think the same goes for the other northern Cali-fornia colleagues that we heard testify in opposition earlier. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. L
AMALFA. Mr. Chairman, pro-viding flexibility for more parts of California does not, indeed, punish any other part of northern California. With that, we have to dispel some of these notions about what the end goal is for this legislation and for my amendment. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Fresno, California (Mr. C
OSTA ). Mr. COSTA. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time. This amendment is about rescheduled water, and this is a technical term that, for people who aren’t familiar with water use in California and other parts of the country, it allows people with water rights, whether they be sen-ior or junior water rights, to reserve that water, in other words, to resched-ule it, to hold it off for another time when it might be more valuable to use. And so this is an important tool. I agree with Congressman L
AMALFA  that water users throughout California should have flexibility to use their water supplies in ways that are most beneficial to be able to reschedule it. I do have some concerns that this amendment may have unintended con-sequences with other water users down-stream should it become law without changes. Specifically, it is critical that those with more junior water rights, like some of the areas I represent south of the California delta, are not nega-tively impacted when they reschedule their water from senior water rights holders. Water is precious. You have water shortages. So if I want to reserve it for later in the year or for the next water year, that means rescheduled water. So for these water users, we want to pro-tect that ability. Additionally, in the event that a fu-ture wet year causes spilling of re-scheduled water, it is critical that the priority of the water spilling is ad-dressed in a fair and equitable manner. I would like to work with the gen-tleman to address these concerns. And I thank him, and I thank the gen-tleman for yielding me the time. Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Chair, I am very pleased to be able to work with my col-league, Mr. C
OSTA , to ensure that these concerns are met and addressed as the bill moves through the Senate. I believe the ability to reschedule water deliveries for these periods when they are needed should be offered as widely as possible, and I appreciate the support in that goal. Indeed, the opportunity that we can help the Central Valley with this, I rel-ish that opportunity to do so. More fa-cilities to store more water is, indeed, very important so we have more flexi-bility for Mr. C
OSTA and his neighbors, constituents. I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from California (Mr. M
CCLINTOCK ). Mr. M
CCLINTOCK. Mr. Chair, I just want to say that this is a very good amendment. The committee supports it, and it is essential to providing the flexibility that is necessary. I might point out to my colleague from California, when we originally de-veloped this bill more than 5 years ago, we consulted more than 60 water agen-cies throughout northern and central California, including many in Demo-cratic congressional districts. Senior water rights are essential to northern California. This bill strengthens them, and Mr. L
AMALFA ’s amendment adds the management flexibility that is long overdue. Mr. COSTA. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. M
CCLINTOCK. I yield to the gen-tleman from California. Mr. COSTA. I thank the gentleman for yielding. That is correct. I know this was of-fered 5 years ago. I would like to point out, though, in the last 5 years of the drought conditions, we have learned a whole lot more about the flexibility and how you can and cannot use re-scheduled water and, of course, how valuable it is.

So I respect and thank the gen-tleman, Congressman L
AMALFA , for working together on this to ensure that we protect all of the water users in their ability to have flexibility, es-pecially during drought times. Mr. L
AMALFA. Mr. Chair, indeed, whether it is a drought period where we have to work even harder to spread that water around or in a year of abun-dance like what we had, we have to be wise about storing it where we can and having the flexibility to put it where we need to and having additional facili-ties in the future to store farther into the drought years that, no doubt, will come. This is what we are looking for in this legislation and what I am try-ing to promote for my particular area in northern California with this amendment. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chair, I am pre-pared to close. How much time do I have remaining? The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California (Mr. L
AMALFA ) has 45 seconds remaining, and the gentleman from California (Mr. H
UFFMAN ) has 2 minutes remaining. Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. L
AMALFA. Mr. Chairman, in-deed, the water battles in California have been very difficult for many, many years, but what I hear from the other side of the aisle is a whole lot of ‘‘no.’’ What I hear from normal Califor-nians who aren’t in positions of elected leadership who seem to be more inter-ested in catering to a few environ-mental groups instead of the needs of Californians, especially on the heels of drought, what these Californians are saying is: Get this stuff done. Get these projects done. Help us out. Help us to have jobs in our State and not cater to just a handful of interests here that will help us through another election. Mr. Chair, I am pleased to present the amendment and proud to work with these folks, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I ac-tually have no problem with my col-league’s attempt to make a clarifica-tion to this bill. That clarification is needed, I am sure, but it is important to realize that the reason it is needed is because we haven’t gone through regular order. We are talking about provisions that have not had the ben-efit of hearings, of markups, of witness testimony, clarifications that would have been made in the regular order process. The underlying bill, it is important to remember, does enormous damage to California water law. That is why it is opposed by the Governor, by our attor-ney general, by our two U.S. Senators, and by many members of the California delegation. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gen-tleman from California (Mr. L
AMALFA ). The amendment was agreed to. AMENDMENT NO . 2 OFFERED BY MR . COSTA  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 printed in part C of House Report 115–212. Mr. COSTA. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as fol-lows: 
At the end of title II, add the following: 
SEC. 204. GEOPHYSICAL SURVEY. 
The Bureau of Reclamation, in cooperation with the United States Geological Survey, the State of California, and local and State water agencies, may conduct detailed geo-physical characterization activities of sub-surface aquifer systems and groundwater vulnerability in California, which has experi-enced a critical, multi-year drought that re-sulted in severe groundwater overdraft in some areas, followed by less than optimal re-charge from the heavy rainstorms and flood-ing during the 2016–2017 winter season. This geophysical survey should include data per-taining to the following: (1) Subsurface system framework: occur-rence and geometry of aquifer and non-aqui-fer zones. (2) Aquifer storage and transmission char-acteristics. (3) Areas of greatest recharge potential. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 431, the gentleman from California (Mr. C
OSTA ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. Mr. COSTA. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I would like to first thank the Rules Committee chairman, and the ranking member, Ms. S
LAUGHTER , for making my amendment in order. Mr. Chair, groundwater storage is a central element of drought resilience in the San Joaquin Valley and throughout California. Recharging our groundwater that has been overdrafted is critical in terms of our overall strat-egy to use all the water tools in our water management toolbox. California’s hydrological cycle is var-ied, with each year’s intense rainfall and flooding like this year followed by prolonged periods of droughts like the previous 5 years. As a matter of fact, in California, it is either feast or famine. We don’t have enough or we have too much water. This varied hydrological cycle means that regions like the San Joaquin Val-ley rely heavily on groundwater to sup-ply regional water needs during the dry years, and that is how the overdraft takes place. An attempt to refill that pumped water during wet years comes all too infrequently. The recent record drought, coupled with previous droughts and policy changes that have led to shifting of water supplies from agriculture water uses to environmental uses over the last 25 years, has literally resulted in ground sinking beneath the feet of the people of the San Joaquin Valley. These depletions led the State of California to pass a law in 2014 that regulates the use of groundwater, with the objective of creating groundwater balance over time. It is called the Sus-tainable Groundwater Management Act, otherwise referred to as SGMA. Obviously, we ought to make our groundwater sustainable, and there are a lot of different ways in which we can do so in terms of that water strategy. This amendment purports to address part of that. Many groundwater basins have been overdrafted for long periods of time. Twenty-one of California’s 515 ground-water basins now are considered criti-cally overdrafted. That is a real, real serious crisis. It is critical that efforts are taken to recharge these groundwater aquifers so that the water is available during the dry years, which we know will surely come. This is all about sustainability. We know that the performance of any projected groundwater recharge and re-covery project is reliant on a thorough understanding of how the surface and subsurface waters interact with a geo-graphical region. Without thoroughly developed and field-verified information about the geophysical characteristics of Califor-nia’s groundwater aquifer systems and best areas for groundwater recharge projects, compliance with California’s recently enacted Sustainable Ground-water Management Act—it is simply infeasible for us to expect that we are going to do that without having all of the information together. What we are trying to do in this leg-islation is provide the opportunity to ensure that we have a reliable water supply so that we have food security. After all, food security, I believe, is a national security issue for America. It doesn’t get looked at that way, but it is. California’s Department of Water Re-sources has identified a number of gaps in the scientific body of knowledge that need to be filled in order to effec-tively recharge groundwater aquifers. Some of these studies show that simply irrigating lands in the Central Valley with right soil conditions for ground-water percolation could lead to an ad-ditional 2 million to 6 million acre-feet of groundwater infiltration. That would double the level of recovery rate in a post-drought winter like 2017. This amendment would authorize the Bureau of Reclamation, partnered with scientific agencies, the United States Geological Survey, and the University of California, to conduct surveys for groundwater aquifers to identify, one, subsurface aquifer systems framework, including the geometry of areas where water can move more easily; two, aqui-fer storage and transmission character-istics; and three, land areas of greatest recharge potential. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. b1800 Mr. M

At the end of title II, add the following: 
SEC. 204. HEADWATER-RESTORATION SCOPING STUDY. 
The Bureau of Reclamation may partner with academia, specifically the University of California, and State and local water agen-cies, to develop a study to enhance mountain runoff to Central Valley Project reservoirs from headwater restoration with the fol-lowing aims: (1) Estimate forest biomass density and an-nual evapotranspiration (ET) across the Shasta Lake watershed for the past decade using satellite and other available spatial data. (2) Identify areas on public and private land that have high biomass densities and ET, and assess potential changes in ET that would ensue from forest restoration. (3) Assess role of subsurface storage in pro-viding drought resilience of forests, based on long-term historical estimates of precipita-tion, drought severity and stream discharge. (4) Assess role of snowpack in annual water balance across the watersheds. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 431, the gentleman from California (Mr. C
OSTA ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. Mr. COSTA. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I would like to first, again, thank the Rules Committee chair and Ranking Member SLAUGHTER  for making my amendment in order, as well as acknowledge my colleague from California, Congressman L
AMALFA , for his work on this amendment. Mr. Chairman, a record drought and the most destructive wildfire seasons on record have brought renewed atten-tion to California’s headwaters. These forests, meadows, and other source waters play a vital role in California’s water supply and management system, and they are under threat from a host of factors, including wildfires, climate change impacts, and poor management policies. More effective forest and headwaters management practices, such as in-creased use of forest thinning and wa-tershed restoration, have demonstrated the potential to provide a measurable increase in water supply to the Central Valley Project reservoirs that receive runoff generated by these headwaters in the Sierra Nevadas, the beautiful mountains that we have in California. The Sierra Nevada mountain range, many people don’t realize, generates nearly 60 percent of California’s devel-oped water supply—60 percent. And that is why the abundance of snow on the mountains during the wintertime is so critical. Some estimates indicate that simply by instituting more effective head-waters management policies, that up to 300,000 acre-feet of additional water supplies—300,000 acre-feet—could be generated each year. Now, that is a significant yield of water when you look at the overdraft crop problems that we have and some of the other authorization of surface storage that we have made last year during the WIIN Act. As a matter of fact, the Bureau of Reclamation has analyzed that some of the projects that I support, such as raising Shasta Dam 18 feet, would gen-erate anywhere from 75 to over 100,000 acre-feet of water annually. So if we can generate an additional 300,000 acre- feet by better managing our head-waters, this is almost three times that yield. Simply managing our forests better could, in many instances, quadruple our water supply and better produce environmental outcomes for our forest ecosystems. To put this in context, this is enough water to irrigate over 100,000 acres, of which we have significant overdraft of land, or provide daily water for an ad-ditional 500,000 homes in California for an entire year. My amendment would authorize the Bureau of Reclamation to enter into partnerships to determine the amount of water that could be untapped by doing these kinds of efforts. Fixing California’s broken water sys-tem, as I have said repeatedly, means using all of the water tools in our water management toolbox. Included in this amendment, we would be having the opportunity to improve our head-water management in an integrated and multidisciplinary approach that is responsive to the changing conditions that we face as we know that will con-tinue to occur. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from northern California (Mr. H
UFFMAN ). Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I want to express my support for this amendment as well. The headwaters of our watersheds play a crucial role in ensuring the reli-ability and the quality of water sup-plies throughout our State. Our water supply depends not just on artificial reservoirs, but also on natural res-ervoirs of snowpack and groundwater retention in the forests of these head-water areas. Healthy, vibrant forests provide mul-tiple benefits, including carbon capture and shade to reduce rapid snowmelt. When they are properly protected, for-est soils act like sponges to absorb rainfall and slowly release it back into rivers and streams throughout the year. This amendment is one of the many ways that we can ensure that the Bu-reau of Reclamation is building a 21st century water supply system for Cali-fornia and the West, so I strongly en-courage support for it. Mr. COSTA. Mr. Chairman, this is a commonsense amendment that has bi-partisan support. Frankly, I think as we learned so much more about how the hydrology of California’s water sys-tems develop, we need to take advan-tage of that knowledge. And this amendment will allow us to do so in a way that makes this so valuable re-source that we sometimes take for granted—that is our water supply—to allow us to use it in a way that makes sense and will provide the water needs for all Californians. Mr. Chairman, I urge the support of this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR (Mr. C

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 431, the gentleman from California (Mr. D
ENHAM ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. Mr. DENHAM. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment to H.R. 23. This amendment updates a small por-tion of the Water Infrastructure Im-provements for the Nation Act, or the WIIN Act, to protect endangered spe-cies and assess water storage opportu-nities. First, it sets a reasonable timeframe for the completion of expanded water storage opportunities at the New Melones Reservoir. These opportunities can increase available storage for con-servation, transfers, and rescheduled water projects to allow for maximum storage within the reservoir. Conserv-ative estimates of increased water stor-age have been at 100,000 acre-feet, which will provide water for over 400,000 people for a year. With such a precious resource, we must ensure our water storage capac-ity is being used responsibly. This timeline of 7 years is consistent with other provisions of the WIIN Act, and will ensure the study will be completed so we can make best use of our water storage capacity. Additionally, this amendment helps protect our threatened and endangered species. In Western States, water users can buy and sell water rights. This provi-sion prevents individuals from using funding set aside for species conserva-tion to buy water rights and sell them back to the government. Funding in section 4010(b) of the WIIN Act was allocated to benefit en-dangered species populations through habitat restoration, improved moni-toring, and conservation fish hatch-eries. This policy has been in effect for the Central Valley Project Improve-ment Act for over a decade and needs to be applied to this section as well. This ensures funding will be used for its intended purposes to help endan-gered species, not to buy and resell water rights. Finally, this amendment extends a program to protect native fish in the Stanislaus River for 2 years. This pro-gram allows for the taking of invasive species that prey on native salmon and steelhead in the Stanislaus River. It was originally authorized for 5 years. However, since the spawn cycle for these salmon is 3 years, it needs to be extended to ensure two full salmon co-hort cycles can be observed. In conclusion, this amendment pro-tects native and endangered species, and ensures we are making the most of water storage capacity at the New Melones Reservoir.

Section 3405(e) of the Central Valley Project Improvement Act is amended by add-ing at the end the following: ‘‘(4) The Secretary, through the office es-tablished under this subsection, shall review available and new, innovative technologies and programs for capturing municipal waste-water and recycling it for providing drinking water and energy, and report on the feasi-bility of expanding the implementation of these technologies and programs among Cen-tral Valley Project contractors.’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 431, the gentleman from California (Mr. D
ESAULNIER ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. Mr. D
ESAULNIER. Mr. Chairman, my amendment asks for a review of ex-isting best practices worldwide for the capture and reuse of wastewater and a feasibility study on the expansion of these efforts. Existing policy requires a review of conservation plans of Central Valley Project contractors. I believe we should look further than just what we are currently doing and learn from new, emerging technologies and prac-tices from around the world for recy-cling wastewater. Capturing wastewater for reuse is not new. Orange County, California, imple-mented its Groundwater Replenish-ment System in 2008, which augments the water supply for 850,000 residents with treated wastewater and helps re-duce the area’s dependence on water from the Sacramento-San Joaquin delta. In Singapore, an initiative to recycle wastewater supplies approximately one-third of the country’s water de-mand. In Israel, treated sewage water meets approximately one-quarter of the country’s needed water. Across California, more than 200 bil-lion gallons of municipal wastewater are already reused each year. Accord-ing to one report, California has an un-realized opportunity to grow that num-ber to between 390 billion and 590 bil-lion acre-feet per year. The need for innovation to increase the amount of available water is very clear. Between 2011 and 2013, even be-fore the onset of one of the State’s most severe droughts on record, water stored in the Sacramento-San Joaquin watershed and the Central Valley dropped by nearly 20 billion cubic me-ters, or two-thirds of the volume of Lake Mead. We need to prepare for more severe droughts in the coming decades. With innovation and technologies available in the United States and around the world, we could and should continue to look for new ways to augment our water supply and enhance our water se-curity. Around the world and across the United States, innovation and tech-nologies for capturing and recycling wastewater are improving, and their costs are falling. The purpose of this amendment is to understand the cur-rent state of these technologies and to identify opportunities for expanding them. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleague to support this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 min-utes. Mr. M
CCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, this amendment adds a superfluous provision that requires a study on a subject that we have already studied to death. We find the left constantly proposing these technologies to manage our ex-isting water shortage often as an ex-cuse not to expand our ability to store new water supplies. The problem is not complicated. These recycling projects are typically four times as expensive as traditional water storage, according to a 2016 study by the California Public Utilities Commission. If we had exhausted our existing re-sources, then these technologies might make sense if the alternative is no water at all. But that is not the alter-native. The alternative is to develop our resources at about one-fourth the cost of these technologies the gen-tleman is trying to sell us—four times the cost. No consumer in his right mind would pay four times more for the same prod-uct. Only politicians would do that, and the problem is when politicians make this choice, consumers end up paying. Which brings me to my second objec-tion to the gentleman’s amendment. Our traditional water projects are paid for by the users of the water in propor-tion to their use, as is the beneficiary pays principle that has guided our water projects for generations.

b1815 These policies protect taxpayers from footing the bill for somebody else’s water. The title 16 recycling projects the gentleman is promoting are not paid for by the water users but rather by general taxpayers, meaning these projects literally rob St. Petersburg to pay St. Paul. If the gentleman would like to con-fine the provisions of the bill to require his constituents to pay four times more for their water or that his con-stituents pay to subsidize the water for my constituents, I would be happy to support him. But I sincerely doubt that is what he has in mind. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. D
ESAULNIER. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. M
ATSUI ). Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Chair, I rise in sup-port of Mr. D
ESAULNIER ’s amendment to H.R. 23. Recycling projects provide sustain-able water sources that help make our communities drought-resilient. In Sac-ramento, we are working to build a project that would use claimed waste-water to irrigate up to 18,000 acres of farmland and habitat. These are the types of projects that help prepare California for the next drought, and they result in more water for our farms and cities. We should be working on sustainable solutions like these. Last Congress, I introduced a bill to improve the Bureau of Reclamation’s Title XVI Water Reclamation and Reuse Funding Program by removing the requirement that each recycling project receive an explicit congres-sional authorization. The bill was in-cluded in the WIIN Act passed into law last year, thereby expanding the pool of eligible projects. Mr. D
ESAULNIER ’s amendment con-tinues to move us forward by empha-sizing the importance of recycling in our approach to managing water use. I urge my colleagues to support it. Mr. D
ESAULNIER. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Cali-fornia (Mr. C
OSTA ). Mr. COSTA. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Fixing California’s broken water sys-tem, as we all know, involves multiple strategies. Recycled water, on-farm re-charge, and other innovative methods of increasing water supply, we have found, improves the situation, but there is no silver bullet to solving Cali-fornia’s long-term water challenges. In the Valley, we understand that, and this is why many communities moved forward on efforts to diversify their water supplies. For example, the Del Puerto Water District has partnered in northern Merced and Stanislaus Counties with the cities of Modesto and Turlock on a project that uses treated wastewater to irrigate ag-ricultural fields, creating significant water security for about 30 percent of Del Puerto’s Central Valley water sup-ply that is rarely delivered. This is cost-effective and costs less than other alternatives. We are partnering with local water districts in the city of Mendota and the city of Fresno. So this is a very valuable source of water, and we ought to encourage it whenever possible. More efforts like this are necessary. Mr. Chair, I support the amendment. Mr. DESAULNIER. Mr. Chair, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from Cali-fornia (Mr. H
UFFMAN ). Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, in de-fense of the economics of water recy-cling, I need to correct the record. The WateReuse Research Foundation has found that recycling projects tend to be among the cheapest ways to in-crease water supply. Potable water reuse is generally comparable or less expensive than alternative options. The Congressional Research Service has found that title 16 water recycling projects are comparable in price to al-ternate water sources—in some cases, substantially cheaper—and there is vast new potential to develop these water supplies. This is exactly the kind of forward- thinking conversation we ought to have if we are serious about California water. Mr. D
ESAULNIER. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. M
CCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I would simply cite to my friend the California Public Utilities Commission report in 2016, and what would be the cost of future sources of water for Cali-fornia. They say very clearly that recy-cling water is nearly four times as costly as traditional sources of water, and that is being generous. I support any water project that pen-cils out. This one does not. This one would require water bills to quadruple. For California, it is exactly policies like these that are driving water bills up. The people of California need to take note of that and to realize the choices they make at the ballot box have real world implications to the bills they are paying for simple things like water and power. Mr. Chair, I ask for a ‘‘no’’ vote, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gen-tleman from California (Mr. D
ESAULNIER ). The question was taken; and the Act-ing Chair announced that the noes ap-peared to have it. Mr. D
ESAULNIER. Mr. Chair, I de-mand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further pro-ceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California will be postponed. 
AMENDMENT NO . 6 OFFERED BY MR . PEARCE  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 6 printed in part C of House Report 115–212. Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as fol-lows: Page 131, beginning on line 5, strike ‘‘Such term shall include water rights for federally recognized Indian Tribes’’. Page 131, beginning on line 19, strike ‘‘(in-cluding any federally recognized Indian Tribe)’’. Page 134, strike lines 7 through 9 and insert the following: (f) I
NDIAN WATER RIGHTS .—Nothing in this title shall have any effect on tribal water rights or their adjudication, or the protec-tion, settlement, or enforcement and/or ad-ministration of such rights by either Indian tribes or the United States as trustee for In-dian tribes. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 431, the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. P
EARCE ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Mexico. Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chairman, water is life. We understand that in the West maybe more than anywhere else in the world. So any time we are talking about water, we are talking about life, we are talking about the ability to have an economy, we are talking about jobs, we are talking about commu-nities. It affects us deeply in the West. When the original bill, H.R. 23, was being marked up, my friend, the gen-tlewoman from California (Mrs. T
ORRES ), brought a concern to the members of the committee, saying that she felt like the underlying bill did not adequately address Tribal water rights. Tribes are some of the areas of deep-est poverty in the country. As she brought that up, it struck my atten-tion that we should take a look at it. Ultimately, her amendment failed in committee, but the two of us, with the chairman and the sponsor of the bill, huddled after the committee meeting and decided that we should move for-ward with our concerns. Those con-cerns are reflected in this amendment today. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. T
ORRES ), to speak about this issue. Mrs. TORRES. Mr. Chairman, I want to begin by thanking also my friend, Representative P
EARCE from New Mex-ico, for offering this amendment with me. Mr. Chair, during our committee work on portions of this bill, I raised this issue and offered a similar amend-ment. So I appreciate Representative P
EARCE for working with me to im-prove the bill for Indian Country. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment because it will provide some limited, though not complete, legal protection for Indian Tribes and their water rights. That said, I con-tinue to have grave concerns with the underlying bill and the impact it will have on Indian Country. Even if this amendment is adopted, the underlying bill will cause signifi-cant harm to Indian Country. For ex-ample, in title 4 of this bill, it blocks

emergency water releases that prevent disease outbreaks for Tribal fisheries in California’s Klamath River. The pro-vision will significantly increase the risk of widespread fish kills and lead to tragic losses for Tribal communities. While this amendment doesn’t miti-gate all of the negative impacts of this bill, it will improve the bill somewhat by including an additional legal protec-tion for Tribal rights that will preserve past, pending, or future Tribal water rights settlements. Mr. Chair, I urge support for this amendment. Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time in opposition, although I am not op-posed. The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? Mr. M
CCLINTOCK. Mr. Chair, I ob-ject. The Acting CHAIR. Objection is heard. Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Colo-rado (Mr. T
IPTON ). The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman will suspend. For what purpose does the gentleman from Colorado seek recognition? Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Chair, to speak to the nature of the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. Is the gentleman opposed to the amendment? Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Chair, I am. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Colorado is recognized for 5 min-utes. Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Chairman, as my colleague from New Mexico noted, Wayne Aspinall of Colorado stated: ‘‘When you touch water in the West, you touch everything.’’ We have that shared concern that that water is going to be preserved. In the West, water is a private property right. We have State law. We have pri-ority-based systems, which have al-ways been recognized by the Federal Government. Unfortunately, we have seen and re-flected in this portion of the legisla-tion that we are discussing today, the Federal Government reaching out to be able to require conditional use of per-mit water rights to be signed over to the Federal Government. At issue is the amendment that we are discussing right now. When we talk about our Native American Tribes, my colleague and I have shared in common interest, along with our colleague, Mrs. T
ORRES , in terms of making sure that Native American rights are protected from taking by the Federal Government, as well. There is good news in the underlying bill. The Department of the Interior had made the statement that their ability to be able to negotiate or enter into water settlements with Tribes is in no way affected or restricted by this bill. It is in no way affected or re-stricted by this bill, according to the Department of the Interior. While I have no objections to the changes proposed in the savings clause to be able to clarify as much, I did want to be able to register concern on the amendment that it may not have been as definitive as I would like to have seen in regard to specifying Na-tive American water rights. I think that is common ground that we are seeing on both sides of the aisle: to make sure that those private prop-erty rights are protected. I will not vote against this amend-ment, and I applaud my colleagues working together with us to be able to try and achieve an actual amiable solu-tion on something that, as Westerners, we understand probably better than anyone else in the country the impor-tance of water—water for our commu-nities, water for the opportunity for our communities to be able to grow and to prosper. On this particular issue, a very im-portant segment of that very commu-nity is the valuable contributions that our Native American Tribes make to all of our communities. Mr. Chairman, I will be supporting the overall legislation. In terms of their work on this, I commend all Members. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chair, may I in-quire as to how much time I have? The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New Mexico has 2 minutes re-maining. Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from Cali-fornia (Mr. HUFFMAN ). Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chair, I cer-tainly appreciate that my colleagues are trying to help mitigate a small amount of the harm caused by this bill, but, unfortunately, the underlying bill remains a disaster for Indian Country. Title 5 of this bill is a direct attack against the existing rights of Tribes in my district. As I have said previously, the salmon in the Klamath River sys-tem are the grocery store, the church, the lifeline for the Tribes in my dis-trict, and this bill explicitly prevents Federal agencies from making emer-gency water releases to combat fish disease and prevent massive fish kills that would devastate these Tribal bal-ance fisheries. That is important to remember, lest we get too carried away with whatever curative effects this amendment might have. Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chair, Tribes in New Mexico and across the West de-pend on water for agriculture, they de-pend on it for their families, they de-pend on it for spiritual reasons. With-out rights, water can be taken by any-one. The amendment that Mrs. T
ORRES  and I put forward is just trying to say that rights are personal. They are pri-vate property rights, and no govern-ment can take them away. It is a rea-sonable amendment. I appreciate the gentleman from Colorado’s observations. We will at-tempt to see that those observations are dealt with in a meaningful way. In the meantime, I simply ask Members of the House to join with me in voting for this amendment to H.R. 23. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gen-tleman from New Mexico (Mr. PEARCE ). The amendment was agreed to. b1830

MOTION TO RECOMMIT  
Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman opposed to the bill? Mr. CARBAJAL. I am opposed in its current form. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to recom-mit. The Clerk read as follows: 
Mr. Carbajal moves to recommit the bill H.R. 23 to the Committee on Natural Re-sources with instructions to report the same back to the House forthwith with the fol-lowing amendment: Add at the end of title IV, the following: 
SEC. 406. WILDFIRE READINESS. 
Nothing in this Act shall impair the abil-ity of the National Interagency Fire Center to ensure that there is an adequate supply of water to fight wildfires, utilizing water from reservoirs or other surface waters. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-tleman from California is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill, which will not kill the bill or send it back to the committee. If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage as amended. My request today is simple: to pro-vide our firefighters with the water they need to effectively fight wildfires. As we speak, two large wildfires are burning in my district on the central coast of California. So far, over 40,000 acres of land have burned between the Alamo fire and the Whittier fire. With more than a dozen homes and structures of central coast residents destroyed, we cannot overstate the im-portant and effective work of hundreds of local, State, and Federal firefighters to contain these blazes and prevent more damages. I spoke with incident commanders and toured both burn sites in Santa Barbara County, witnessing firsthand the incredible damage wreaked by these fires to our region. I was grateful for the opportunity to address our firefighters and first re-sponders and to thank these brave men and women for willing to risk their own safety to protect infrastructure and save lives. In one harrowing instance, a fire-fighter cleared a path, driving a bull-dozer through flaming brush to rescue dozens of Boy Scouts trapped at a campground at Lake Cachuma. Today, we have a duty as appropri-ators to provide these men and women, working tirelessly in difficult condi-tions, with the resources they need to effectively combat these frequent and devastating wildfires across our coun-try, and especially in my home State. Ignoring our wildfire response when dealing with water allocation is irre-sponsible and will put American lives in danger. In addition to adopting this simple amendment to ensure our firefighters’ access to water, I urge my colleagues to work to end the disruptive practice of fire borrowing. b1900 We cannot continue to rob funds des-ignated for wildfire prevention to pay for fighting fires and simultaneously expect agencies to carry out effective land management practices to reduce the impact of catastrophic wildfires in the future. Our Federal land management agen-cies are overwhelmed by the dramatic increase in fires on public lands in re-cent years, and we cannot in good con-science continue to ignore their urgent need for both prevention and fire-fighting funding. I am deeply concerned that this underlying bill today does nothing to address the issues of limited water resources for our agencies charged with fighting wildfires. I call upon my colleagues to adopt this com-mon-sense amendment and show our fire-fighters that Congress not only appreciates their efforts, but acts to support them as well. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH5532 July 12, 2017 
Mr. M CCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to the mo-tion to recommit. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-tleman from California is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. M
CCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, my friends’ concerns are well placed; his amendment is completely misplaced. The fact is that, for 45 years, our en-vironmental laws have made the man-agement of our forests virtually impos-sible. After 45 years of experience with these laws, imposed with the explicit promise they would improve our forest environment, I think we are entitled to ask: How is our forest environment doing? And the answer is damning; our forests are dying. Timber harvests of surplus timber have fallen 80 percent in those years. The result is severe overcrowding in our forests. An acre normally supports between 20 to 100 trees, depending upon the topography; but because of these laws, average density in the Sierra has now ballooned to 266 trees per acre. In this crowded condition, these trees fight for their lives against other trees trying to occupy the same ground. And in this crowded and stressed condition, they fall victim to disease, pestilence, drought, and, ultimately, catastrophic wildfire. The answer is not this amendment that seeks to derail this needed water storage; it is to restore scientific man-agement to our forests to restore them to a healthy condition. When I visited the command center of the Rim Fire several years ago that threatened Yosemite Valley, I asked the firefighters: What answer can I take, in your name, back to Congress? And the answer was: Treatment mat-ters. We need proper forest manage-ment. The good news for my friend from Santa Barbara is he will soon have the opportunity to vote on just such a bill, the Resilient Federal Forest Act, by Mr. W
ESTERMAN of Arkansas. It treats this problem comprehensively. It passed the House Natural Resources Committee. We hope to bring it soon to the floor of the House. It will address the problems that plague our forests by restoring proper scientific manage-ment to our public lands. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is or-dered on the motion to recommit. There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit.

NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZA-TION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018 The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-ant to House Resolution 431 and rule XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consider-ation of the bill, H.R. 2810. The Chair appoints the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. M
ITCHELL ) to pre-side over the Committee of the Whole. b1920 
IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE  
Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill (H.R. 2810) to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2018 for military activities of the De-partment of Defense and for military construction, to prescribe military per-sonnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for other purposes, with Mr. M
ITCHELL in the chair. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the first time. The gentleman from Texas (Mr. T
HORNBERRY ) and the gentleman from Washington (Mr. S
MITH) each will con-trol 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may con-sume. Mr. Chairman, I am proud to bring before the House H.R. 2810, the Na-tional Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018. It was reported favor-ably by the House Armed Services Committee at 11:59 p.m. on June 28, 2017, by a vote of 60–1. Now, that vote is an indication of the bipartisan sup-port that exists to support our troops and to fulfill our obligations placed on us by the Constitution. Mr. Chairman, I think it is always helpful for us to remind ourselves of the authority by which we undertake our responsibilities. Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution says that Congress has the power and the responsibility ‘‘to raise and support Armies. . . . To provide and maintain a Navy; To make Rules for the Government and Regula-tion of land and naval Forces,’’ and, of course, ‘‘To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers.’’ The members of our committee and our staff take those responsibilities very seriously. This year, we seek to carry them out in a world which is as dangerous and complex as any of us have ever seen. One example from the news of the day is the alarming progress North Korea is making to-wards having an intercontinental bal-listic missile that can carry nuclear weapons to our homeland. Now, we have, of course, a number of tools to use, including diplomacy and sanctions, but there is no substitute for military power, and I believe we must develop and deploy more of it to be ready to deal with these growing threats. So the bill before us today substan-tially increases money for missile de-fense so we are more capable of pro-tecting our homeland against those ballistic missiles. It also increases funding for key munitions and for in-telligence surveillance and reconnais-sance so we can have better visibility on what adversary is doing. It increases the end strength for the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force, just as they requested. And it funds more joint exercises with key allies in the Pacific. It boosts our shipbuilding budget to get more ships into the water faster, and also cheaper. So, just as an example, Mr. Chair-man, each of those items is important for dealing with this growing threat coming from North Korea, and we could sit here and go through a similar sort of discussion when it comes to Iran, or the provocative actions of Rus-sia and China, or the terrorist organi-zations of various shades. Of course, we cannot guarantee that the capabilities that we will vote on in this bill will be available by the time the crisis comes for, unfortunately, Mr. Chairman, we are still dealing with de-fense budgets that were cut by more than 20 percent at a time when the threats around the world were growing. So we can’t guarantee that these capa-bilities will be available when we need them. But what we can guarantee is, if we don’t fund these things now, they will not be available when we need them, so that is the priority given to this bill. Mr. Chairman, exactly 1 month ago, on June 12, Secretary Mattis and Chairman Dunford testified before our committee. And I would like to read just one paragraph of the Secretary’s testimony where he was comparing what the military was like when he left it and when he came back as Secretary. Secretary Mattis testified: ‘‘Four years later, I returned to the Depart-ment and I have been shocked by what I have seen with our readiness to fight. For all the heartache caused by the loss of our troops during these wars, no enemy in the field has done more harm to the readiness of our military than sequestration. We have sustained our ability to meet America’s commit-ments abroad because our troops have stoically shouldered a much greater burden.’’ Four years later, shocked, more harm by sequestration than the en-emies in the field, and it is only be-cause our folks are so incredible that they have born an increasing burden. That is what the Secretary testified. Mr. Chairman, we have, indisputably, the finest military in the world, but it is also indisputable that it has been se-verely damaged by continuing resolu-tions, by sequestration, and by failure of the executive and legislative branches to adequately support the men and women out there on the front lines. We have an urgent need to begin to repair and rebuild our military. And I also believe, Mr. Chairman, it is fundamentally wrong to send men and women out on dangerous missions without providing them the best equip-ment, in the best shape, with the best training that our country can possibly provide. This bill, if followed by match-ing appropriation, takes a significant step toward meeting that objective, to support those troops. It also makes major reforms in the way the Pentagon does business. Among other reforms, it enables the military to buy commercial products through online sites such as Amazon, Staples, and Grainger. We require life cycle maintenance costs to be consid-ered at the beginning of a program, as must intellectual property rights, to maximize competition in the mainte-nance and repairs. Oversight into serv-ice contracts has increased, and there is much more, of course, in the bill. Mr. Chairman, this bill is the vehicle by which we usually, for 55 years, at least, fulfill our responsibilities under the Constitution that I mentioned, to provide for the common defense. I be-lieve that is the first job of the Federal Government. I want to just express my apprecia-tion to each of the members of our committee. Each of them has contrib-uted to the product before us. Each of them takes their responsibilities under the Constitution very seriously; no one more so than the Ranking Member, Mr.

SMITH of Washington. We don’t always agree on the judgment calls about issues, but I have no doubt that he and all the members of the committee try to do what is right for the country and put the interests of our troops first. That is exactly the attitude that we must follow, I think, on the floor over the next 3 days as we go through the amendments which we will consider. I also want to express appreciation to the committee and personal staff who have worked on this bill. It has been a challenging year for a variety of reasons, but, as I started, I will finish. I am proud of this product. I hope it will gain the support of the entire House. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 5 minutes. I thank the chairman, first of all, for his hard work on this bill, and all the members of the committee and the staff. As the chairman has pointed out, this is a bill that we have passed for 55 straight years. It is a long and com-plicated bill that essentially sets the defense and national security policy for our country, and there is a lot of good work that has gone into this bill. Again, I thank the members for doing that. They recognize the complex threat environment that the chairman correctly described, and we are at-tempting to address it as best we can in this very difficult environment. I think the thing that is most dif-ficult that I really want to emphasize is what the chairman said in the mid-dle of his remarks: that over the past 6 years we have had one government shutdown, a number of continuing res-olutions, several threatened govern-ment shutdowns, and the unpredict-ability that that has presented to the Defense Department. Now, to be clear, it has also pre-sented a fair amount—the same amount of unpredictability to the non-defense discretionary budget that also has to deal with those challenges. But that uncertainty about our budget has made it very difficult to plan, and no-where is that more important than at the Department of Defense. b1930 As they try to lay out a strategy for national security, not knowing from one month to the next how much money you are going to have or what you are going to be able to spend it on is a huge problem. I will say a little bit more about this later, because as big a problem as that is, we haven’t solved it. As we debate this bill here today, we do not have a budget resolution from either the House or the Senate. This is a problem we still need to work on. However much money we wind up spending on defense, if we had a cohe-sive plan and a clear idea of how much money we were going to have over the next few years, it would be a lot easier to plan for those contingencies. Again, I do want to compliment the work that has been done on this bill. Particularly, I focus a lot on unconven-tional threats. I think that is the changing nature of the world. I used to chair what is now called the Emerging Threats Committee. I want to thank Congresswoman S
TEFANIK and Ranking Member L
ANGEVIN for their work and focusing on cyber, focusing on sup-porting our special operation forces that have borne so much of the brunt of the fight that we face in countering terrorism. I also want to thank Chairman R
OG-
ERSand Ranking Member C OOPER for their work on the Strategic Forces Subcommittee, focusing on space, in particular, on the importance of em-phasizing that. For a long time, our country dominated space. We didn’t have to worry about it. But now a lot of other countries are catching up and competing with us. I think this bill re-flects the importance of that. So there are a lot of very solid things in this bill, but I want to close by em-phasizing two significant problems that we still need to address. One I mentioned already. We don’t have a budget resolution. This bill has $621 billion in it, as I understand it, in the base bill, and another, I believe, $75 billion in the overseas contingency fund. We are spending nearly $700 bil-lion in this bill on defense. That is a lot of money, and the chairman men-tioned a lot of the very necessary pro-grams that it is going towards. How-ever, that breaks the budget caps. In order to break the budget caps, the House and the Senate have to vote to break the budget caps. It is July. We haven’t done that. I will emphasize that in the Senate it actually requires 60 votes to break the budget caps. So as much as I see the need in de-fense, given the complex threat envi-ronment out there, it is very possible that $72 billion of what is in this bill is going to disappear between now and the end of this year unless we address the broader issue of sequestration and budget caps. I will also emphasize that addressing that issue by gutting funding for the nondefense discretionary budget and plussing up defense is not going to work for a couple of reasons. Number one, a lot of the national se-curity needs that we have come out of some of those other items. The pro-posal to cut the State Department by 31 percent in a time when we face the complex threat environment that was described is ridiculous. In fact, I will quote Chairman Mattis as well, who said: 
If you are going to cut the State Depart-ment by 30 percent, you better give me five more divisions because I am going to need them. We are not going to be able to resolve conflicts in a peaceful way. 
And also, of course, we have domestic needs that are very important as well. We are still waiting on the infrastruc-ture package from the administration. There are a lot of needs that are not being met, and we are not yet voting to bust the budget caps. Here we have a bill that does that, but this House has to step up and take that vote if this de-fense authorizing bill is going to go for-ward. The second and final point, we still don’t have a national security strategy from the White House. Now, we have a very complex threat environment, as I have said more often than I meant to during the course of the last few min-utes—we do. We have got Russia, China, North Korea, Iran, a variety of terrorist threats. What we have heard in our committee for the last 6 months is a series of people from the Pentagon coming over and saying the house is on fire. We don’t have enough money to do—fill in the blank. There are a whole lot of different things. What we haven’t heard is a strategy, and the most disturbing conversation I had in that regard was with someone from the Office of Net Assessment. The CHAIR. The time of the gen-tleman has expired. Mr. SMITH of Washington. I yield myself an additional 1 minute. He explained to me that we laid out a strategy in 2012 and said we do not have the money to fund that strategy right now. So I asked him: Well, how short are you? How much more money do you need? He looked at me like he didn’t under-stand what I was asking, so I sort of ex-plained it. The short answer: he didn’t know. How could he not know? I mean, if you can sit there confidently and say, ‘‘My gosh, we don’t have enough money; we are way crazy short of our 2012 strategy’’ and you still can’t say how short, then you don’t have a strat-egy. We need a strategy to make sure this money is spent wisely. I will close with a compliment of the chairman for something that he has done. We should also not assume that simply spending more money at the Department of Defense is necessarily going to make us safer. We have to make sure we spend it efficiently and effectively. I think this bill has a lot of very solid efforts to try to make us do that, towards acquisition reform, to-wards spending the money more wisely. It is not just a matter of spending more money. We have got to spend it smarter, and we have got to confront the lack of a strategy, and we have got to confront the fact that we still have not resolved our budget resolution problem. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chair, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gen-tleman from South Carolina (Mr. WIL-
SON), chairman of the Subcommittee on Readiness. Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the House Armed Services Committee chairman, M
ACTHORNBERRY , for his determined leadership to promote peace through strength. I am grateful to support H.R. 2810, the National Defense Authoriza-tion Act for Fiscal Year 2018.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH5536 July 12, 2017 
First of all, I would like to thank my colleague and ranking member, Con-gresswoman M
ADELEINE BORDALLO of Guam, for her tireless efforts and par-ticipation in this process, and I also thank the Readiness Subcommittee members of the House Armed Services Committee on both sides of the aisle for bipartisan input on this bill. The creation of the 2018 National Defense Authorization Act truly was bipar-tisan. Mr. Chairman, over the past several months, we have heard testimony from every military service branch about their urgent need to address the alarm-ing readiness shortfalls. Their testi-monies were sobering, confirming Con-gress must take bold action. Here today, we have the responsi-bility of reducing the risk to our serv-icemembers by making sure they are well trained, supported, and that the equipment they use is properly main-tained and combat ready. There are nu-merous important readiness provisions in the authorization, including adding over $2 billion to long-neglected facili-ties sustainment and restoration and modernization accounts. It gives the Department of Defense more responsive facility construction, repair, and real estate authorities for more efficient use of DOD resources. It extends multiple temporary hiring authorities to allow the Department of Defense to fill critical manpower gaps, in particular at our defense industrial facilities—our depots, arsenals, and shipyards. None of the readiness provisions are arbitrary. They are specifically tar-geted to stop and, as much as possible, to reverse the decline of the readiness of our Armed Forces so we can con-tinue to combat and deter the threats to national security from around the world. Mr. Chairman, I strongly support H.R. 2810, the National Defense Author-ization Act for Fiscal Year 2018, and encourage my colleagues in the House to support it as well. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-tlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms. T
SONGAS ), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Tactical Air and Land Forces. Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Chairman, two weeks ago, the Armed Services Com-mittee advanced the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 to the House floor with broad bipar-tisan support. I would like to thank Chairman T
HORNBERRY and Ranking Member S
MITH for their work in devel-oping this year’s bill. I would also like to thank Congress-man T
URNER , chairman of the Tactical Air and Land Forces Subcommittee, of which I am the ranking member, for his leadership and spirit of bipartisan-ship this year. This year’s bill includes investments to fill genuine readiness needs and funding that is critical to ensuring that our men and women in uniform have the best cutting-edge resources and best equipment possible to keep them safe when defending our Nation. I was encouraged that the bill we have passed out of committee directs the Defense Department to provide spe-cific updates and reports on a number of programs and platforms so that we can robustly conduct our oversight re-sponsibility on behalf of the American people. However, as we consider the bill on the floor today and in the coming days, I remain concerned about how we fund these needs. Substantial budget in-creases for the Department of Defense at the expense of other vital national programs undermines investments in our national competitiveness and the future of our country and, I believe, makes us less secure over the long term. Providing our men and women in uni-form with the resources they need to carry out their mission is one of our most solemn obligations, but we must also fund these resources responsibly in order to safeguard our economic vital-ity and our national security. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. TURNER ), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Tactical Air and Land Forces. Mr. TURNER. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2810, the Na-tional Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018. I have the privilege of serving as the chairman of the Tactical Air and Land Forces Subcommittee, and I want to particularly thank my subcommittee’s ranking member, Ms. T
SONGAS , for her support in completing the markup of the bill, as well as for her hard work and for the bipartisan work that we have done together on the issue of sex-ual assault in the military. I appre-ciate her leadership in that. I strongly support this bill and can’t emphasize enough Chairman T
HORN -
BERRY ’s steadfast leadership in raising the top line in this bill. This bill rec-ommends $631 billion, a significant and needed increase over the original budg-et request that supports both the base and unfunded requirements, which to-taled over $30 billion. Without Chair-man T
HORNBERRY ’s leadership, this number would not be sufficient. We are presenting a budget that helps rebuild the readiness of our forces. This increased base funding will begin to rebuild full-spectrum readi-ness from years of deferred moderniza-tion brought on by the previous admin-istration. Within the Tactical Air and Land Forces Subcommittee jurisdiction, this bill authorizes over $12 billion in addi-tional funds to address critical un-funded modernization requirements identified by the services. The bill recognizes the importance of land forces in current and future oper-ations and authorizes over $2 billion to accelerate armored brigade team mod-ernization, to include additional Abrams tanks and Bradley fighting ve-hicles. The bill addresses strike fighter ca-pability and capacity shortfalls and au-thorizes another $2 billion in additional funding to secure additional F–35 Strike Fighters and F–18 Super Hor-nets to address unfunded requirements for the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps. I am also pleased that this bill sup-ports the European Deterrence Initia-tive, using OCO and addressing the needs of our European allies. This bill contains language from the BE HEARD sexual assault bill that I worked with Representative TSONGAS  on, that we introduced in June, and I am very proud that we continue to ad-vance for the cause of protecting our servicemembers from sexual assault. I am also pleased to note that Evan’s Law is included in this bill. This bill will ensure that the that Department of Defense implements military resi-dential window safety measures to pro-tect against unintentional falls by young children. Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support the National Defense Author-ization Act. Mr. SMITH of Washington. I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Guam (Ms. B
ORDALLO ), ranking mem-ber of the Subcommittee on Readiness. Ms. BORDALLO. Mr. Chairman, I would first like to commend Chairman T
HORNBERRY , Ranking Member S MITH, and the committee staff who have worked many long nights on the Na-tional Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018. While there are very real questions about the top line number, and I be-lieve it would be inappropriate and reckless to have any additional funding come off the backs of nondefense spending, this is an important step for-ward in rebuilding our military readi-ness. This bill includes additional oper-ations and maintenance funding to sup-port more combat training center rota-tions and needed investment in the fa-cilities sustainment, restoration, and modernization accounts, providing more training opportunities and better maintenance facilities to live, work, and operate in. However, readiness can-not be bought back in a year, and these targeted investments must continue. Furthermore, the bill provides au-thorities to right-size civilian per-sonnel shortfalls that have stressed maintenance backlogs at our shipyards and our depots. It also will make more effective the Department’s Quarterly Readiness Report and raise the minor military construction threshold and clarify unspecified projects to provide additional flexibility to the Depart-ment. I would especially like to thank Chairman T
HORNBERRY for following through on his commitment last year to work with me to include my provi-sion that would help address critical workforce shortages affecting military

construction and healthcare essential to the military buildup on Guam. I also thank our Ranking Member S
MITH and Readiness Subcommittee Chairman J
OEWILSON for working with me on this issue and on this bill. I look for-ward to continuing to work together to protect the full intent of this legisla-tion. The readiness portion of this bill also includes provisions to support ship re-pair in the western Pacific, as well as full funding for critical military con-struction projects. b1945 Given our posture, our strategic needs and challenges in the region, it is essential that we continue to suffi-ciently resource and support an active and engaged Indo-Asia-Pacific force. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle as this process continues. And lastly, Mr. Chair, I would like to commend Vickie Plunkett for her over two decades of service in the House of Representatives, and 10 years on the House Armed Services Committee. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. R
OG-
ERS), the chair of our Subcommittee on Strategic Forces. Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chair, I would like to thank Chairman T
HORN -
BERRY and Ranking Member S MITH for their leadership in bringing this years’s NDAA. I would also like to thank my friend and colleague from Tennessee, Mr. J
IMCOOPER , the ranking member on our subcommittee, for being such a great partner as we worked on this im-portant bill. Now, I would like to focus on some key provisions in the bill. First, space reform. This bill takes two monu-mental steps to reform national secu-rity space. First, the bill provides for the creation of a space core within the Air Force to fix the fragmented space acquisition process. Second, it provides for the establish-ment of a subordinate, unified com-mand for space under U.S. Strategic Command to ensure integration of the joint command of all space operations. I can’t stress enough the urgent ne-cessity of these reforms. Our society and our military are enormously de-pendent on space. Meanwhile, our ad-versaries continue to grow their counterspace capabilities. These adver-saries have already reorganized their space forces toward the goal of neutral-izing our advantage in space. Multiple studies going back almost two decades have recommended a space force to fix our space acquisition and management problems. Regardless, the DOD and the Air Force have yet to fix the problem. Decisionmaking authori-ties for space acquisitions remain frag-mented across over 60 organizations. This bill would consolidate acquisition authority and improve our ability to jointly operate in space. Earlier this week, I returned from Asia where I got to meet with our troops on the Korean Peninsula. I was in theater when North Korea conducted their intercontinental ballistic missile. We must be vigilant when it comes to our missile defenses, and this year’s NDAA does that. Noteworthy initiatives in the bill in-clude the authorization of approxi-mately $2 billion in additional funds for the Missile Defense Agency. It also accelerates our efforts to develop a space-based sensor and interceptor ca-pabilities. Lastly, the bill supports our nuclear deterrence and includes provi-sions to improve the oversight of our nuclear command, control, and com-munications. Mr. Chair, I urge support of this im-portant legislation. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 3 min-utes to the gentleman from Rhode Is-land (Mr. LANGEVIN ), the ranking mem-ber of the Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities. (Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chair, I want to thank the ranking member for yield-ing. And, Mr. Chair, I would like to begin by thanking Chairman T
HORN -
BERRY , Ranking Member S MITH, and Chairwoman S
TEFANIK for their collec-tive efforts in crafting this bill that is before us this evening. I would also like to thank the staff who worked tirelessly on this produc-tive and forward-thinking legislation. It is an honor and a privilege to serve as a senior member of the House Armed Services Committee on behalf of the selfless servicemen and women who protect our Nation every day, and I am proud of the very strong bipartisan ef-fort represented by this year’s NDAA. Mr. Chair, we accomplish a number of important objectives in this bill. First of all, we enhance our deterrence capabilities in Europe and support our Nation’s submarine force. I am very proud of the Virginia class submarines that we build starting right in my dis-trict, and we also provide strong sup-port for the Columbia class program that will be the Ohio replacement pro-gram. We also make it clear that climate security is, indeed, national security, backing the Department in its efforts to build resilience, reduce risk, and prepare for all types of threats that may come our way, even if those threats come from climate change. But as ranking member of the Sub-committee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities, I am particularly proud of the provisions we have included on cy-bersecurity, special operations, and re-search and development. We strengthen our cyber cooperation with our part-ners and allies through both training and collaboration with the NATO Coop-erative Cyber Defence Centre of Excel-lence. We better leverage the U.S. Global Engagement Center to combat propa-ganda and information warfare oper-ations conducted against America and her allies, and we grant permanent au-thority for family support programs within Special Operations Command that reflect the unique needs of these warfighters and their families. We also reinvigorate the DOD schol-arship program so that students are en-couraged to pursue information secu-rity degrees and can come to work de-fending our Nation from the get-go. We can have all of the cyber policies in place that we want, but if we don’t have the trained workforce to execute those policies, we are going to be be-hind the curve, and this helps to close that gap. We advance hypersonic weapons re-search, development, and especially transition efforts. We prioritized the readiness of U.S. Cyber Command in our Cyber Mission Force, and we strengthen congressional oversight of sensitive cyber military operations and command cyber warfare tools and capa-bilities. This approach was deliberate in na-ture, and it moves us closer to a mili-tary that will be able to address the va-riety of threats that we face in the 21st century. Again, I would like to thank Chair-man T HORNBERRY , Ranking Member S
MITH, and Chairwoman S TEFANIK , and all of my colleagues on the House Armed Services Committee, as well as the staff, for their hard work on this very important bill. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. W
ITT-
MAN), the distinguished chair of the Subcommittee on Seapower and Pro-jection Forces. Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2810, the FY18 National Defense Authorization Act, but I continue to be surprised at some of the national security pundits who believe that a diminished force struc-ture will improve our national secu-rity. Some have questioned whether we should fully fund national defense. Some have even questioned whether we should continue to expand our armed services to meet the strategic chal-lenges posed by a rising China and Rus-sia, by an unpredictable North Korea, and a belligerent Iran. Mr. Chairman, our time is up. The time of action is now. The focus of our Nation is upon us to provide for our na-tional security. I am pleased that we appear to have turned the tide in prop-erly resourcing the requirements of our armed services; and I am pleased that we are authorizing the funding to match our strategy and providing what our combatant commanders need to win any future conflicts; and I am pleased that we have acknowledged the importance of our servicemembers and the hardships that they endure so that we can enjoy our free and democratic society.

In reference to the Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee, I be-lieve that we have reversed a trend to-ward a diminishing Navy and are tracking toward a strengthened 355- ship fleet. The bill expands on the eight ships requested by the administration and adds an additional five ships. The bill also recommends additional ad-vance procurement for aircraft carriers and attack submarines, while fully funding the Columbia class ballistic missile submarine and the B–21 raider bomber programs. As to aircraft, the bill recommends an expansion of KC–46As, C–130Js, E– 2Ds, and P–8s. Finally, the bill delivers the right authorities that will save the Department of Defense billions—yes, billions—of dollars. Additionally, I want to recognize Ranking Member J
OECOURTNEY . He has done extraordinary work and has been a true partner in this journey and continues to work in a collaborative, bipartisan basis, to deliver the best for our national security. I continue to be impressed with the results that can be achieved when a subcommittee and the full committee focuses on a common goal and works to achieve bipartisan results. I urge my colleagues to support the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-tlewoman from California (Ms. S
PEIER ), the ranking member of the Sub-committee on Military Personnel. Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his out-standing leadership and candor on our committee. I want to give a special shout-out to our chairman, Mr. T
HORN -
BERRY , who shaved an hour and a half off our deliberations a couple of weeks ago by bringing us into the 21st cen-tury, and laptops to look at our amend-ments. So it was a great improvement. I also want to thank my chair, Chair-man M
IKECOFFMAN , for his leadership. We have worked well together, and I look forward to continuing that rela-tionship, and also to a top-notch staff. This bill includes provisions that will provide the military services flexibility to recruit and retain members of our armed services and continues our com-mitment to taking care of our military families. The NDAA continues funding for DOD impact aid for schools with large numbers of military-connected families and authorizes reimbursement, up to $500 for military spouses’ expenses re-lated to obtaining a professional li-cense or certification when moving to a new State. The committee continues to provide oversight of important programs in the bill requiring reviews to ensure the Mo-rale, Welfare, and Recreation programs are properly funded to required levels and the Department of Defense’s debt collection practices are fair and do not place undue burdens on servicemem-bers or their families. The bill includes the PRIVATE Act, which I cosponsored with Congress-woman MARTHA MCSALLY and other members of the committee to prohibit the wrongful broadcast or distribution of intimate visual images and ensure the military services have the tools to prosecute those who violate the law. The bill also provides support for vic-tims of sexual assault by mandating training for Special Victims’ Counsel to recognize and address unique chal-lenges often faced by male victims of sexual assault. I am pleased that the bill continues the committee’s efforts to assist those with post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury, as well as en-suring families are educated on suicide factors that are often associated with TBI or post-traumatic stress. However, as Ranking Member S
MITH has said, this NDAA fails to make the hard choices and trade-offs that are ex-pected of us. The NDAA goes beyond the President’s request to provide 2.4 percent pay raises for our servicemen and -women, at an additional cost of $200 million, an expense simply added to the top line. The NDAA also authorizes an in-creased end strength for the Army at a cost of $4 billion, again, simply adding it to the top line. Certainly, our troops deserve a pay raise, but the question that must be asked is: Where is the money coming from? And on what basis are these decisions being made? Congress has not received a strategic plan from the Pentagon that would in-form us on how large the military needs to grow. By just adding funding to the NDAA, Congress is not providing the stable, predictive funding the mili-tary needs. In order to do that, we need to address the big elephant in the room, the sequestration and budget control act caps. The CHAIR. The time of the gentle-woman has expired. Mr. SMITH of Washington. I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentle-woman. Ms. SPEIER. Despite all of these ad-ditions, the committee was unfortu-nately unable to find the required off-sets to fund an extension to the Special Survivor Indemnity Allowance to en-sure it does not expire in May 2018. This falls short of my strong desire, shared by other members of the com-mittee, to permanently fix the survivor benefit compensation. This also amounts to a shameful tax on over 60,000 surviving spouses who are already struggling emotionally and financially. While the SSIA extension would be an important temporary fix, Congress must make a permanent fix to the offset. We cannot continue to allow sur-viving military spouses to suffer from our inaction. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds just to make two points. Number one, President Barack Obama was inaugurated in January 2009. The first national security strat-egy he submitted was in May of 2010, a year-and-a-half later. So I don’t think it is completely unreasonable that we haven’t yet gotten the national secu-rity strategy from the new administra-tion. Secondly, the pay raise for the troops is based on the statutory formula which is related to the cost of living. That is where it comes from. And it seems to me to say, no, you don’t real-ly get what the formula says you de-serve, is not appropriate. Now, the administration did not re-quest it, and the criticism from some is that we should not provide it. I think if the formula is wrong, we should change it, but if the formula says that is how much the cost of living has gone up, we should provide it. Mr. Chair, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gen-tleman from Colorado (Mr. C
OFFMAN ), the chair of the Subcommittee on Per-sonnel. Mr. COFFMAN. Mr. Chair, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2810, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018. The bill contains significant policy and funding initiatives that continue our commitment to maintain military personnel and family readiness and ad-dress issues important to our troops. The provisions contained in this bill provide our warfighters, retirees, and their families the necessary pay and benefits to sustain them into today’s highly stressed force. To support these efforts, this bill es-tablishes a fully funded by-law pay raise for all of our servicemembers overriding the President’s ability to re-duce the pay raise. After years of lower than by-law pay raise requests, it is critical that we continue to give our troops and their families the pay in-creases they deserve. b2000 The bill increases the end-strengths of our Active Duty, National Guard, and Reserve forces, increasing mission readiness while reducing the stress and strain on the force and their families. The bill further focuses last year’s management reform of the Military Health System to provide clear respon-sibility for the delivery of healthcare services at military medical treatment facilities and for military medical readiness. The bill also stops an ill-considered, cost-saving measure that would close several U.S. military hospitals over-seas. We believe our servicemembers and their families should continue to have the best medical care possible wherever they serve. It also continues to improve sexual assault prevention and response by adding a new provision to the Uniform Code of Military Justice specifically prohibiting nonconsensual sharing of intimate images, expanding Special Victims’ Counsel training to include training on the unique challenges often

faced by male victims, and clarifying the process by which a designated rep-resentative can be appointed by a vic-tim prior to a court-martial. The CHAIR. The time of the gen-tleman has expired. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman from Colorado. Mr. COFFMAN. Finally, servicemem-bers returning to civilian life and their spouses are challenged by varying State licensure and certification re-quirements. Rather than imposing a single Federal standard on the States, we provide for a $500 reimbursement to defray these costs. We ask States to work with the Secretary of Defense to develop common standards where pos-sible. In conclusion, I want to thank Ms. S
PEIER and her staff for their contribu-tions to the mark and support in this process. Of course, we were joined by an active, informed, and dedicated group of subcommittee members. Their recommendations and priorities are clearly reflected in the National De-fense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018. Additionally, I appreciate the dedication and hard work of the sub-committee staff. Mr. Chairman, I strongly urge my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 2 min-utes to the gentlewoman from Cali-fornia (Mrs. D
AVIS). Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Chair-man, I rise to commend the dedicated bipartisan work of the House Armed Services Committee in recognizing our subcommittee chairs, members, and the staff as well in bringing this crit-ical bill to the floor. But as it has been stated earlier, the budget numbers that we are talking about contained in the bill are, unfor-tunately, aspirational. We have not passed a budget resolution, and the Budget Control Act is still the law of the land. While it is true that the BCA was a bipartisan failing—we can all take credit for that—pointing fingers does not solve the problems. We are on an uncertain and dangerous path, one where we have not been honest with ourselves on many levels and where we continue to play games with our men and women serving in the military. We must recognize that the only path to solving these issues is bipartisan collaboration and legislation to repeal the BCA. Continuing resolutions and unrealistic, deeply partisan budgets amount to nothing more than profes-sional malpractice. I have to say, Mr. Chairman, that I was encouraged to see that the Senate included a proposal similar to the one I introduced during markup to con-tinue paying the widows of service-members who died in defense of our Na-tion. Their personal compensation is not just a small gesture but our funda-mental responsibility. I am also encouraged by the promise our chairman made regarding this issue. He said that the issue ‘‘has to be fixed and will be,’’ but there are, as he acknowledged as well, ‘‘difficult trade-offs that have to be made.’’ I com-pletely agree. We will all have to con-tribute to the solutions. I am prepared to do that, and I know that my col-leagues are as well. We all have to hope together that we move forward and be prepared to do that. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. HARTZLER ) who is the distinguished chair of the Sub-committee on Oversight and Investiga-tions. Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018. I would like to thank Chairman T
HORN -
BERRY and Ranking Member S MITH for bringing this important bill to the floor. As Members of Congress, it is our re-sponsibility to provide support for our men and women in uniform while they selflessly serve our Nation. This bill takes significant steps to address our military’s severe readiness crisis by en-suring that our troops have the re-sources, training, and capabilities needed to face the growing threats of today. As chairwoman of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, I am proud of the provisions included in this bill to reform the Foreign Military Sales process, provide funding to ad-dress the critical infrastructure needs of the U.S. Nuclear Security Enter-prise, and protect our Nation’s highly sensitive U.S. military information— information that our adversaries are actively seeking to exploit. This bill is good news for the warfighter. It authorizes 22 additional F–18 Super Hornets to help fill the Navy’s strike fighter shortfall and fully funds the B–21 Raider—a critical platform needed to deter and defeat fu-ture aggression around the world. I am proud to represent Missouri’s Fourth Congressional District, which is home to Whiteman Air Force Base and Fort Leonard Wood. This bill funds modernization programs for the B–2 Spirit and authorizes phase one of a new hospital facility at Fort Leonard Wood. Since arriving to Congress, I have been fighting to address the infrastruc-ture needs of our Army ammunition plants, like the one at Lake City, which is the sole source for our Army’s small caliber ammo. These plants are in dire need of modernization, and this bill authorizes much-needed funding to help improve these deteriorating facili-ties. Thanks to the leadership of Chair-man T
HORNBERRY , the Armed Services Committee increased defense spending to meet the needs of today’s warfighter. I appreciate the oppor-tunity to work with Ranking Member S
ETHMOULTON and all the committee members on this bill. I am proud of the bipartisan fashion in which we work, and I urge my colleagues to support its passage. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-tleman from Maryland (Mr. BROWN ). Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Mr. Chair-man, first, let me start by thanking Chairman T
HORNBERRY and Ranking Member S
MITH not only for their lead-ership but the bipartisan collaborative approach to the work of the com-mittee. Certainly as a new member of the 115th Congress, I find that very refresh-ing. From what I have seen, it is no surprise that 50-plus years in a row we have successfully passed the NDAA. Mr. Chairman, the United States faces serious security threats: aggres-sion from North Korea and Russia, long and costly campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq, and new battlefields in cyber-space and in outer space. After years of sequestration, there is consensus certainly in the House Armed Services Committee that Con-gress must address readiness shortfalls and modernization challenges facing our military. So in the NDAA, we made greater investments in training and equipping the forces and prioritized projects that extend our technological and warfighting edge. But increasing defense authoriza-tions and appropriations, absent a clear national security strategy, will not make our country safer. We need a smart, strategic approach to national security that provides clear goals and objectives and that incorporates an all- of-government approach. That means not only increasing defense spending, but also ensuring funding for the State Department and USAID and reversing proposed cuts to nondefense programs that make the world more stable and secure. We owe it to our servicemen and -women to provide them with both the resources to accomplish their mission abroad and to pursue the American Dream when they return home, and that is good schools, family-supporting jobs, and safe neighborhoods. We can-not do one at the expense of the other. The long-term success of our country depends on that. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. S
TEFANIK ) who is the distinguished chair of the Subcommittee on Emerg-ing Threats and Capabilities. Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Chairman, today I rise in strong support of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018, which increases readiness and ensures that those who serve our Nation are fully equipped, trained, and supported. As the chairwoman of the Sub-committee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities, I am especially proud of the oversight regarding stronger cyber warfare capabilities, safeguarding tech-nological superiority, enabling our Special Operations Forces around the

globe, providing resources and authori-ties to counter terrorism and uncon-ventional warfare threats, and ener-gizing programs and activities that counter the spread of weapons of mass destruction. Our achievements in cybersecurity carry three broad themes: First, the bill increases congressional oversight of cyber operations by including a bill introduced by myself, Ranking Member L
ANGEVIN , Chairman T HORNBERRY , and Ranking Member S
MITH that ensures Congress is kept fully informed of sen-sitive military cyber operations. Second, we bolster international partnerships for cyber warfare to counter aggressive adversaries, includ-ing efforts to counter and mitigate ad-versarial propaganda efforts and infor-mation warfare campaigns. Third, the bill continues to build and enhance our U.S. cyber warfare capa-bilities and activities. Furthermore, Mr. Chairman, this bill reinforces counterterrorism and uncon-ventional warfare capabilities by fully resourcing U.S. Special Operations Command’s programs and activities and increasing congressional oversight of intelligence activities. Finally, I would like to thank Mr. R
OGERS , chairman of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee, for including language that supports the decision for a future East Coast missile defense site. I would like to thank Mr. C
OFFMAN , chairman of the Military Personnel Subcommittee, for including portions of my bill, the Lift the Relocation Bur-den From Military Spouses Act. Before I conclude, I would like to thank Chairman M
ACTHORNBERRY for his leadership, as well as my sub-committee ranking member, Congress-man J
IMLANGEVIN of Rhode Island, for his bipartisan energy and cooperation on all of these issues. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 2810. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to how much time remains on each side. The CHAIR. The gentleman from Washington has 9
1⁄2minutes remaining. The gentleman from Texas has 8 min-utes remaining. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. B
ACON ) who is a valued member of the com-mittee and a retired Air Force General. Mr. BACON. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in staunch support of the Na-tional Defense Authorization Act of 2018. I served in the military under the past five Presidents starting with Ron-ald Reagan and witnessed firsthand the erosion of our combat edge. When I joined the military, we out-trained our competitors with a 2-to-1 flying-hour advantage. Today, we are lagging be-hind them in training, and it is uncon-scionable to send our warriors to fight without every possible advantage. We don’t want a close fight, but that is where we are at today. As a General Officer, I was charged with preparing our forces to prevail over any adversary, a nearly impos-sible task given the damage done by a 22 percent reduction of defense spend-ing over the last 8 years while we are at war. This act will begin to right the ship with a 10 percent top-line increase providing the means to rebuild readi-ness, deter aggression, and defeat ad-versaries. It invests in peace through strength. The Constitution charges this body with the power to provide for the com-mon defense. For the Armed Services Committee, this is a solemn obligation rooted in over 50 years of bipartisan-ship, and we meet this obligation with the 2018 NDAA. Mr. Chairman, I urge support. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. KNIGHT ) who is another very valuable member of our committee. Mr. KNIGHT. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 2810, the National De-fense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018. This bill is the result of mindful deliberation and absolute dedication to our Nation’s soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines. I am proud to be standing here with fellow members of the Armed Services Committee and speak to the merits of this legislation. In particular, the acquisition reforms in this bill will help get proven, ad-vanced equipment in the hands of serv-icemembers faster and for a better price. This bill brings much-needed in-novation to the way defense acquisi-tion personnel spend taxpayer dollars and the way commercial businesses en-gage with the U.S. Government. It prioritizes oversight of service con-tracts. This type of contract accounts for over 50 percent of DOD contract ex-penditures, which up to now was un-clear and unanalyzed. It will help se-cure a better value for precious dollars spent through reforms in the contract auditing process. The small-business industrial base is a critical part of DOD procurement. Our small businesses have a unique ability to strengthen our contracting process by driving innovation and com-petition in the marketplace. It is im-portant that we create opportunities for these contractors and strengthen entrepreneurial development programs and help eliminate barriers of entry and diversify our industrial base. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-tleman from Connecticut (Mr. C
OURT -
NEY) who is the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Seapower and Pro-jection Forces. Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Chairman, I thank Mr. S
MITH for yielding and com-pliments to him and Chairman THORN -
BERRY for the outstanding work, again, that the two of them have collaborated on to keep this really massive under-taking on schedule. It is really a very truncated schedule this year, but they both did it. Again, it is kudos to both of them in terms of their leadership skills. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong sup-port of the 2018 NDAA. Front and cen-ter in our deliberations in the Seapower and Projection Forces Sub-committee on which I serve with Chair-man W
ITTMAN , who is in his first term and did an outstanding job, was the build-up of our Navy fleet which has been a multiyear process of strategic planning. b2015 In December of last year, the prior Navy secretary, Ray Mabus, who served in the prior administration, re-leased an updated force structure as-sessment that laid out the requirement for increasing the Navy’s fleet from 308 ships to 355. Then, in January, Navy officials out-lined a plan to get us on a construction plan to get us on a path to a larger fleet. In early May, the chief of naval operations emphasized that ‘‘time is of the essence’’ in growing the Navy. The stage was set to get started on the larger fleet. That was why so many of us were surprised on May 23 and dis-appointed when the White House sent over basically a 308-ship budget for a 355-ship fleet. I am proud to say that, on a bipar-tisan basis, we have done much better in this bill than the budget that came over. Among other things, the bill ex-plicitly makes it the policy of our Na-tion to achieve a 355-ship Navy. We add five additional ships in 2018, for a total of 12, to get us moving to the larger fleet that the prior administration and the new administration know that we need. One area I am particularly proud of is the area of undersea forces. Reflect-ing the urgent testimony of our com-batant commanders, our panel once again led the way in forging an aggres-sive but realistic plan to grow our sub-marine fleet. To achieve this, our bill authorizes multiyear procurement authority for 13 Virginia class attack submarines for the next 5 years. Not only would this keep us at the two-a-year level we have been on for the last few years, but would go even further by reaching a three-submarine build rate in the com-ing years. The seapower portion of the bill does much more to support a range of prior-ities on the seas and in the skies, far too many to itemize here today. I will just say that I am proud of the bipartisan contribution of all of our subcommittee members into the prod-uct before the House today, and, again, Mr. W
ITTMAN for his first year as sub-committee chairman. In particular, I want to highlight the work of our subcommittee staff in

helping us craft the bill. I am joined here today by one of my staff, Stephen Clement, who has been working with us, but he is going to be moving on to better things. I want to publicly thank him for his outstanding work in terms of helping us get to the place we are here today. In closing, I would urge my col-leagues to support the Defense Author-ization bill. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. B
ANKS ), a valuable mem-ber of our committee who continues to serve our Nation in the Reserves. Mr. BANKS of Indiana. Mr. Chair, I rise today to express my strong support for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018. As the most recently deployed vet-eran serving in Congress, serving in Af-ghanistan just 2 years ago, I know the national security challenges facing our country firsthand. While these chal-lenges are not easily solved, this legis-lation represents a significant step for-ward. I want to take a moment and specifi-cally thank Chairman T
HORNBERRY for his leadership and assistance to myself and other freshman members of the committee. Working together with colleagues on both sides of the aisle, the Armed Serv-ices Committee has crafted a bill fo-cused on rebuilding and reforming the Department of Defense. By procuring what we need, fixing what we already have, and by being good stewards of the taxpayers’ dollars by proposing new contract audit reforms, this bill begins the hard work of getting our Depart-ment back on the right track. While we cannot control the existen-tial threats facing our Nation, we must ensure those in uniform are ready to address those threats when necessary. Moreover, as this week’s tragic C–130 accident that claimed the lives of 16 servicemembers reminded all Ameri-cans, our servicemembers place their lives on the line each day. The CHAIR. The time of the gen-tleman has expired. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman. Mr. BANKS of Indiana. From giving our troops a well-deserved raise to funding our vital missile defense pro-grams, I believe this legislation begins the process of rebuilding and reforming our military so we are ready for what-ever comes next. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Chair, what I really want to focus on is the budget problem, because that is really underlying all of this. We have heard a lot of good speeches from Members talking about what is in this bill, how important it is, how what is in this bill is attempting both to meet our national security threats and, as importantly, to make sure that we take care of the men and women who serve our military, who fight to protect us to make sure, first of all, that they and their families are taken care of from a financial standpoint, but also to make sure they have the equipment and training they need to be ready to fight the fights that we ask them to go to. I think that is one of the great challenges. Whatever it is we decide ought to be our national security strategy, I think the thing we all agree on is we need to make sure we provide the training, equipment, and support so that the men and women who serve in the mili-tary are ready for that fight. The worst thing we can do is create a hollow force and set up an expectation that: You need to do all of this, but we are only going to train you for that. So if this other stuff comes up, you are not going to be ready. We have talked about this a lot in our committee to make sure that we are ready for the fight that comes. And that is where the budget creates a very significant problem. We have talked a lot about the Budg-et Control Act and sequestration. It is pretty clear why we had the Budget Control Act and sequestration. I was here for it. We were days away from not raising the debt ceiling and basi-cally not meeting our commitments to pay our bills. There are those who fig-ure that that can be a significant prob-lem. So we made an agreement. We were going to try to get the budget under control. Sequestration was put in place, with the expectation that it wouldn’t be implemented because we would come to a grand bargain on rev-enue and spending that would get our deficit under control. Well, we didn’t, and sequestration kicked in. But as we sit here today, even if we got rid of sequestration, even if we got rid of the budget caps, we are still $20 trillion in debt. We are going to run a $700 billion deficit. This is projected to go nowhere but up in the years ahead. I don’t believe that is sustainable. Now, I don’t think we need to bal-ance the budget tomorrow or next year or even in the next 5 years, but we need to get ourselves on a sustainable path. And we flat refuse to do that. You don’t see a lot of campaigns promising to cut specific programs or promising to raise taxes. I love the fact that if you poll the American people, there is a very clear consensus on what they think we ought to do about this problem. First of all, somewhere in the neigh-borhood of 80 percent of them support a balanced budget now, by the way. Not 5, 10 years, but right now. You ask them: Well, here are all the places where the government spends money. What would you like to cut? The answer to that question is: noth-ing. Literally nothing. The Pew Research folks do a poll on this every year, and in every single category a majority of people would rather keep the money the same or in-crease it, as opposed to decrease it. Of course, if you ask them what taxes they would like to increase, by and large, they don’t want to increase taxes. It is interesting. If you can con-vince people that the taxes in question will not apply to them, for a brief mo-ment they will be supportive of it. But then someone will come along and con-vince them that at some point it might apply to them, and then they oppose it. So our task as Members of Congress is to balance the budget without rais-ing taxes or cutting spending. That, of course, is impossible. So what we have chosen to do is put off that decision for as long as is humanly possible. That is why we do not have a budget resolution. Any budget resolution this body could create would fail on prob-ably multiple fronts of what the public expects. It wouldn’t balance the budg-et. It would cut spending they didn’t want to cut. It probably wouldn’t raise taxes, coming from this majority, but if it did, it wouldn’t be popular. So we have to start having an honest con-versation about the budget. We hear in the Armed Services Com-mittee all the time about all the needs, all the shortfalls, all the critical things we need to do. We argue about it and argue about it, but in 6 years the Re-publican majority has not put forward a plan to control mandatory spending. They say that is the problem. No plan to do that. Certainly, they haven’t even considered the possibility of in-creasing revenue. If we are this serious—and we should be—about making sure that we have the funds necessary to provide an ade-quate national security, then we should stop cowering from the budget debate. Personally, I am all for raising taxes because I see the needs that the chair-man and everybody else has described, and I am actually prepared to pay for them. So we need to do that. That overarching budget problem is what has put us in this mess. As we talk about this bill, as I said, it is $72 billion over the budget caps. Unless we get a vote to lift those budg-et caps—which I just mentioned is po-litically unpopular, which is why we haven’t done it for the full 6 months we have been in session this year—then that $72 billion goes away and the Pen-tagon is back in chaos. So this may be a good bill. It may be solid. It doesn’t have the backing of the budget. Let me finally suggest that there are some things that the Department of Defense could do. This is why the strat-egy is so important. Yes, the Obama administration wait-ed until May of 2010. They didn’t have 6 years of CRs and government shut-downs and threatened shutdowns and the changing threat environment that we have. They had a reasonably con-sistent set of problems. It was a set of problems, but they had the same Sec-retary of Defense from the previous ad-ministration. They had time to look at that.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH5542 July 12, 2017 
We need this strategy urgently be-cause the big question is: Are we spend-ing the money correctly? Is the Depart-ment of Defense spending the money in the right way? Do we have a strategy to figure out how we should prioritize? We don’t. With this crushing budget environment, it is absolutely critical that we do. We need to consider the possibility, for instance, that we might be spending some money that we shouldn’t be spending. I will often ask that question of the generals who come over and tell us how short they are of everything. I say: Well, where are we spending money, in your opinion, that we shouldn’t be? They never answer the question. You cannot tell me in a $700 billion budget in a place as large as the Pentagon that there isn’t somebody over there who knows to say: Look, we shouldn’t be doing this. Just to give one suggestion, we have had the BRAC debate forever. We have had a shrinking military, yet we have maintained the same infrastructure. We have seen study after study from the Air Force and others about how much excess capacity they have and money that could be saved from doing that. But again this year, for, I submit, political reasons, BRAC is prohibited. So we need to get a lot smarter about how we are going to spend this money and a lot smarter about our budget if this bill is actually going to become re-ality. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Chairman, as usual, the gen-tleman from Washington makes a num-ber of good points. We absolutely need to have national security based on a strategy and fund that strategy. There are many of us who would argue that is not what has happened in recent years. I would just point out it was not only President Obama, but also President Bush and President Clinton. None of them provided a national security strategy in the first year that they were in office. I have tremendous con-fidence in Secretary Mattis, among others on the national security team. I believe they are looking at these issues and will provide us with a strategy. The gentleman is also absolutely cor-rect when he points out that the De-fense Authorization bill is only one step in the process. There are many more steps to come. I think we will have a budget on this floor to vote on shortly. I also expect that we are going to have appropria-tions to vote on at some point in the coming weeks. I also believe that we are going to have the opportunity to vote on dealing with the sequestration caps, which, by the way, the adminis-tration and I think most of us in the House and I presume most in the other body as well are in favor of doing away with because they have not been suc-cessful in accomplishing the goal for which they were put in place. So there are clearly many more de-bates to have on other days. What we have this week on the floor before us is the Defense Authorization bill. And it is our obligation to authorize the things that the military needs. I want to go back to the point that Mr. B
ANKS made a few minutes ago. These are life-and-death decisions. Our hearts break, our prayers go out to the families of the 15 marines and the one sailor who lost their lives Monday of this week in the plane crash in Mis-sissippi, just as our hearts go out and our prayers continue for the family members of the seven sailors who lost their lives off of Japan a few weeks ago. What it reminds us is exactly what Mr. B
ANKS said: this is a dangerous business, even on training mission, even on routine deployments. The men and women who volunteer to serve our country to protect us and to secure our freedoms deserve the very best our country can provide them. That is the goal of this bill: support the men and women who serve us and to further the national security of the United States. You have heard from both sides of the aisle about many good things that are in this bill. We are going to go through a lot of amendments over the next several days. But at the end of the day, the point is, even with the good, the bad, and the ugly that gets put in this bill, to support the men and women who serve by voting ‘‘yes,’’ and I hope my colleagues will do that. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chair, I ask that the following exchange of letters be included in the R

The 2018 NDAA supports our men and women in uniform by providing a much de-served 2.4 percent pay increase and extend-ing special pay and bonuses for servicemembers. This bill further supports mili-tary families by prohibiting the proposed re-duction in inpatient care for military medical treatment facilities located outside the United States, and will provide up to $500 for a spouse’s expense related to obtaining a li-cense or certification in another state because of a military move. Our nation’s military is one of the major eco-nomic drivers for the State of Texas. Texas is home to several of America’s largest military bases, including Fort Hood in Killeen, Fort Bliss in El Paso, and Joint Base San Antonio. Texas is also home to major defense manu-facturing facilities that help our servicemembers protect America and employ thousands of hardworking Texans. The NDAA includes a provision, Section 3507, that will authorize the U.S. Maritime Ad-ministration to designate and provide assist-ance to certain community colleges and work-force training centers as ‘‘centers of excel-lence’’ that provide valuable skills in the mari-time sector. This language will help community colleges, like San Jacinto College, in our district in Har-ris County, Texas, that provides a modern, comprehensive training program for working in our maritime industry. San Jacinto College works closely with Houston’s maritime commu-nity and the Port of Houston, and recently opened a state-of-the-art maritime training center last year. This provision is modeled after legislation I introduced with Rep. R
OBERT WITTMAN earlier this year, the Domestic Maritime Centers of Excellence Act (H.R. 2286). I hope our col-leagues will support our Centers of Excellence provision and ensure its inclusion when the NDAA reaches the President’s desk. I ask all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in supporting the National De-fense Authorization Act. The CHAIR. All time for general de-bate has expired. Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment under the 5- minute rule. In lieu of the amendment in the na-ture of a substitute recommended by the Committee on Armed Services, printed in the bill, an amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 115– 23, modified by the amendment printed in part A of House Report 115–212, is adopted. The bill, as amended, shall be considered as an original bill for the purpose of further amendment under the 5-minute rule and shall be consid-ered as read. The text of the bill, as amended, is a follows:

SEC. 101. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. 
Funds are hereby authorized to be appro-priated for fiscal year 2018 for procurement for the Army, the Navy and the Marine Corps, the Air Force, and Defense-wide activities, as speci-fied in the funding table in section 4101. Subtitle B—Army Programs 
SEC. 111. REPORT ON ACCELERATION OF INCRE-MENT 2 OF THE WARFIGHTER INFOR-MATION NETWORK-TACTICAL. 
(a) R EPORT .—Not later than January 30, 2018, the Secretary of the Army shall submit to the congressional defense committees a report on op-tions for the acceleration of the procurement and fielding of Increment 2 of the Warfighter Information Network-Tactical program of the Army (referred to in this section as ‘‘WIN-T In-crement 2’’). (b) E
LEMENTS .—The report under subsection (a) shall include the following: (1) An estimate of the level of funding re-quired to procure a sufficient quantity of WIN- T Increment 2 components to field thirty Bri-gade Combat Teams or equivalent units in the period beginning with fiscal year 2018 and end-ing with fiscal year 2022. (2) A plan for fielding WIN-T Increment 2 to all Armored Brigade Combat Teams of the Army and associated combat vehicles, including the Armored Multipurpose Vehicle. (3) A plan for integrating WIN-T Increment 2 on the Stryker combat vehicles fielded to Stryker Brigade Combat Teams of the Army. (4) A list of potential upgrades to WIN-T In-crement 2 that may improve program capabili-ties, including size, weight, and complexity, and the impact of these improvements on the cost of the program. (5) Options for fielding an Expeditionary Command Post capability that effectively inte-grates WIN-T Increment 2 and command post infrastructure. (6) A detailed plan for upgrading the existing WIN-T Increment 1 system to the latest WIN-T Increment 2 configuration that includes— (A) an estimate of the level of funding re-quired to implement the plan; and (B) the effect of the plan on the fielding of mobile mission command to the reserve compo-nents of the Army. (7) Any other matters the Secretary determines to be appropriate. Subtitle C—Navy Programs SEC. 121. AIRCRAFT CARRIERS. 
(a) S ENSE OF CONGRESS ON INCREASE IN NUM-
BER OF OPERATIONAL AIRCRAFT CARRIERS .— (1) F
INDINGS .—Congress finds the following: (A) Aircraft carriers are an essential element of the Navy’s core missions of forward presence, sea control, ensuring safe sea lanes, and power projection, and provide the flexibility and versatility necessary for the execution of a wide range of additional missions. (B) Forward airpower is integral to the secu-rity and joint forces operations of the United States. Carriers play a central role in delivering forward airpower from sovereign territory of the United States in both permissive and nonpermis-sive environments. (C) Aircraft carriers provide the Nation the ability to rapidly and decisively respond to na-tional threats, to conduct worldwide, on-station diplomacy, and to deter threats to allies, part-ners, and friends of the United States. (D) Since the end of the cold war, aircraft car-rier deployments have increased while the air-craft carrier force structure has declined. (E) Due to the increased array of complex threats across the globe, the Navy’s aircraft car-riers are operating at maximum capacity, in-creasing deployment lengths and decreasing maintenance periods in order to meet oper-ational requirements. (F) To meet global peacetime and wartime re-quirements, the Navy has indicated a require-ment to maintain two aircraft carriers deployed overseas and to have three additional aircraft carriers capable of deploying within 90 days. However, the Navy has indicated that the exist-ing aircraft carrier force structure cannot sup-port these military requirements. (G) Despite the requirement to maintain an aircraft carrier strike group in both the United States Central Command and the United States Pacific Command, the Navy has been unable to generate sufficient capacity to support combat-ant commanders and has developed significant carrier gaps in these critical areas. (H) The continued use of a diminished aircraft carrier force structure has resulted in extensive maintenance availabilities which typically ex-ceed program costs and increase time in ship-yards. These expansive maintenance availabil-ities exacerbate existing carrier gaps. (I) Because of maintenance overhaul exten-sions, the Navy is truncating basic aircraft car-rier training to expedite the deployment of available aircraft carriers. Limiting aircraft car-rier training decreases operational capabilities and increases risks to sailors. (J) Despite the objections of the Navy, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics directed the Navy on August 7, 2015, to perform shock trials on the U.S.S. Gerald R. Ford (CVN–78). The Assistant Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Oper-ations, Plans and Strategy indicated that this action could delay the introduction of the U.S.S. Gerald R. Ford (CVN–78) to the fleet by up to two years, exacerbating existing carrier gaps.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH5550 July 12, 2017 
(K) The Navy has adopted a two-phase acqui-sition strategy for the U.S.S. John F. Kennedy (CVN–79), an action that will delay the intro-duction of this aircraft carrier by up to two years, exacerbating existing carrier gaps. (L) Developing an alternative design to the Ford class aircraft carrier is not cost beneficial. A smaller design is projected to incur significant design and engineering cost while significantly reducing magazine size, carrier air wing size, sortie rate, and on-station effectiveness among other vital factors as compared to the Ford class. Furthermore, a new design will delay the introduction of future aircraft carriers, exacer-bating existing carrier gaps and threatening the national security of the United States. (M) The 2016 Navy Force Structure Assess-ment states ‘‘A minimum of 12 aircraft carriers are required to meet the increased warfighting response requirements of the Defense Planning Guidance Defeat/Deny force sizing direction.’’ Furthermore, a new National Defense Strategy is being prepared that will assess the defeat/ deny force sizing direction and may increase the force structure associated with aircraft carriers. (2) S
ENSE OF CONGRESS .—It is the sense of Congress that— (A) the United States should expedite delivery of 12 aircraft carriers; (B) an aircraft carrier should be authorized every three years; (C) shock trials should be conducted on the U.S.S. John F. Kennedy (CVN–79), as initially proposed by the Navy; (D) construction for the U.S.S. John F. Ken-nedy (CVN–79) should be accomplished in a sin-gle phase; and (E) the United States should continue the Ford class design for the aircraft carrier des-ignated CVN–81. (b) I

(B) On the ability to meet requirements: ‘‘The entire fleet supports five general homeland secu-rity missions. . .The ability of the UH–1N to ac-complish these missions was evaluated in 2006, and the aircraft was found to be ‘not effective.’ The shortcomings of the UH–1N were derived from specific mission requirements for carrying capacity, airspeed, unrefueled endurance, mis-sion range, force protection for the floor, spe-cific protection for all aircrew and passengers, survivability, and materiel availability.’’. (C) Regarding previous efforts to acquire a re-placement aircraft, the report identified efforts that date back to 2006, including— (i) an initial analysis of alternatives by Air Force Space Command in 2006; (ii) the common vertical lift support platform program, which was cancelled in 2013; (iii) two RAND corporation studies funded in 2013; and (iv) the then-current proposal of the Air Force to procure modified Army UH–60 helicopters.

(3) On March 2, 2016, at a hearing before the Committee on Armed Services of the House of Representatives, the Commander of Air Force Global Strike Command, General Robin Rand stated: ‘‘We will not meet the emergency secu-rity response with the present helicopter.’’. (4) On April 4, 2017, at a hearing before the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate, the Commander of the United States Strategic Com-mand, General John E. Hyten stated: ‘‘Of all the things in my portfolio, I can’t even describe how upset I get about the helicopter replace-ment program. It’s a helicopter, for gosh sakes. We ought to be able to go out and buy a heli-copter and put it in the hands of the people that need it. And we should be able to do that quick-ly. We’ve been building combat helicopters for a long time in this country. I don’t understand why the heck it is so hard to buy a helicopter.’’.

(4) Former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates has stated: ‘‘Over the next 20 years and more, certain pressures-population, energy, climate, economic, environmental-could combine with rapid cultural, social, and technological change to produce new sources of deprivation, rage, and instability.’’. (5) Former Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army Gordon Sullivan has stated: ‘‘Climate change is a national security issue. We found that climate instability will lead to instability in geopolitics and impact American military operations around the world.’’. (6) The Office of the Director of National In-telligence (ODNI) has stated: ‘‘Many countries will encounter climate-induced disruptions— such as weather-related disasters, drought, fam-ine, or damage to infrastructure—that stress their capacity to respond, cope with, or adapt. Climate-related impacts will also contribute to increased migration, which can be particularly disruptive if, for example, demand for food and shelter outstrips the resources available to assist those in need.’’. (7) The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has stated: ‘‘DOD links changes in pre-cipitation patterns with potential climate change impacts such as changes in the number of consecutive days of high or low precipitation as well as increases in the extent and duration of droughts, with an associated increase in the risk of wildfire. . . this may result in mission vulnerabilities such as reduced live-fire training due to drought and increased wildfire risk.’’. (8) A three-foot rise in sea levels will threaten the operations of more than 128 United States military sites, and it is possible that many of these at-risk bases could be submerged in the coming years. (9) As global temperatures rise, droughts and famines can lead to more failed states, which are breeding grounds of extremist and terrorist organizations. (10) In the Marshall Islands, an Air Force radar installation built on an atoll at a cost of $1,000,000,000 is projected to be underwater within two decades. (11) In the western United States, drought has amplified the threat of wildfires, and floods have damaged roads, runways, and buildings on military bases. (12) In the Arctic, the combination of melting sea ice, thawing permafrost, and sea-level rise is eroding shorelines, which is damaging radar and communication installations, runways, sea-walls, and training areas. (13) In the Yukon Training Area, units con-ducting artillery training accidentally started a wildfire despite observing the necessary prac-tices during red flag warning conditions. (b) SENSE OF CONGRESS .—It is the sense of Congress that— (1) climate change is a direct threat to the na-tional security of the United States and is im-pacting stability in areas of the world both where the United States Armed Forces are oper-ating today, and where strategic implications for future conflict exist; (2) there are complexities in quantifying the cost of climate change on mission resiliency, but the Department of Defense must ensure that it is prepared to conduct operations both today and in the future and that it is prepared to address the effects of a changing climate on threat as-sessments, resources, and readiness; and (3) military installations must be able to effec-tively prepare to mitigate climate damage in their master planning and infrastructure plan-ning and design, so that they might best con-sider the weather and natural resources most pertinent to them.

SEC. 1036. RESTRICTION ON USE OF CERTAIN FUNDS PENDING SOLICITATION OF BIDS FOR WESTERN PACIFIC DRY DOCK. 
(a) F INDINGS .—Congress makes the following findings: (1) Following closure of the Department of the Navy ship repair facility in Guam in 1997 fol-lowing the Base Realignment and Closure round of 1995, operation of the facility was turned over to a private company. (2) While streamlining operations, resulting in savings to the Navy of approximately $38,000,000 each year, the company was able to maintain the depot-level capabilities of the facility with dry-docking capability that had existed in Apra Harbor since World War II. (3) From 1997 to 2012, the private operator suc-cessfully performed 28 major overhauls with dry-dockings of Navy, Military Sealift Com-mand, and Coast Guard vessels, 27 mid-term availabilities, as well as the emergency dry- docking of USS San Francisco (SSN-711) after the nuclear powered submarine collided with a seamount off the coast of Guam in 2005. (4) While the privately owned dry-dock, Ma-chinist, was undergoing upgrades and refur-bishment in 2013, the Navy announced that it would split the long-standing depot-level capa-bility in Guam into two pieces, awarding an ini-tial contract for pier-side ship repair, to be fol-lowed by a contract for dry-dock ship repair. (5) At this time, the Committee on Armed Serv-ices of the House of Representatives, including the Delegate from Guam, as well as the Gov-ernor of Guam, objected to this plan, and a con-ditional agreement was made wherein the Navy committed to restoring dry-docking capabilities expeditiously following issuance of the pier-side contract. (6) Despite repeated requests from the Com-mittee on Armed Services of the House of Rep-resentatives, the Delegate from Guam, and the Governor of Guam over the past four years, the Secretary of the Navy has failed to issue the dry-dock contract. (7) The Navy conducted a business case anal-ysis to assess options for a dry-docking capa-bility in Guam in 2014 and agreed to provide a copy of the report to Congress upon completion. The draft business case analysis was provided to the Committee on Armed Services of the House of Representatives on March 3, 2016, but a final document was not produced. (8) The draft business case analysis evaluated 200 potential options for restoring a dry-docking capability in Guam, recommending seven poten-tial courses of action, with estimated costs rang-ing from $324,000,000 to $398,000,000 over a 50- year life cycle. The business case analysis con-cluded that any of these options are significant savings when compared with the cost of not having a dry-docking capability in Guam, which exceeds $700,000,000 over a 50-year period. (9) The Navy has removed machinery and equipment needed to perform major overhauls from the former ship repair facility, and shifted ship repair work previously performed in Guam to various foreign locations in the Western Pa-cific. The total cost of Navy ship repair con-tracts in Guam have gone from $45,00,000 in 2010 to $16,000,000 in 2016. (10) As a result of Navy actions over the past five years, the number of skilled workers en-gaged in ship repair in Guam has been reduced from a combined total of approximately 550 at three ship-repair companies in Guam to the cur-rent level of 150. Due to this degraded workforce and equipment capabilities, the Navy is now forced to rely almost exclusively on foreign ship repair instead at a time when the Committee be-lieves tensions and threats of crisis in the West-ern Pacific can put access to foreign shipyards at risk. (11) Navy leadership has long acknowledged the importance of a depot-level, dry-docking ca-pability in Guam, as evidenced by the following: (A) ‘‘Robust depot-level ship repair capability in Guam is a matter of strategic importance and

remains an operational necessity because ships of the 7th Fleet have high operational tempo and experience vast distances between repair fa-cilities.’’ (Letter from the Commander of the Pa-cific Fleet to the Governor of Guam, dated Feb-ruary 15, 2013). (B) ‘‘We must maintain a viable ship mainte-nance capability in Guam to include dry-dock-ing in support of operations and contingency plans (OPLANs and CONPLANs) and the U.S. Navy rebalance to the Pacific. Guam is a stra-tegic in-theater location for depot-level ship maintenance on sovereign U.S. territory. This is a significant factor given that commercial dry docks available in foreign countries considered friendly to the United States may become un-available to SEVENTH Fleet ships in time of cri-sis or war. Availability of CPF ships would be stressed if assets are required to dry dock in CONUS due to the non-availability of a secure dry docking capability in the Western Pacific. Dry-docking in Guam is a critical component of depot-level ship repair. The capability must be maintained and regularly exercised so that a ca-pability and expertise are available to support ships of the SEVENTH Fleet in peace and war.’’ (Letter from the Commander of the Pacific Fleet to the Chief of Naval Operations, dated Feb-ruary 7, 2014). (C) On February 24, 2016, in testimony before the Committee on Armed Services of the House of Representatives, Admiral Harry Harris, Com-mander of the United States Pacific Command, affirmed that he continues to view robust ship repair capabilities as a matter of strategic im-portance and an operational priority for United States Pacific Fleet. (12) The Navy currently has four fast-attack nuclear submarines homeported in Guam. (13) The Navy homeports submarine squad-rons at seven locations in the United States, each of which has a dry-docking capability, with the exception of Guam. (14) The Committee on Armed Services of the House of Representatives believes that dry-dock-ing capability in Guam is a strategic require-ment and a cost-effective means of ensuring the Forward Deployed Fleet has depot-level repair capabilities at a United States port in the West-ern Pacific. (15) Amounts were authorized to be appro-priated in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 (Public Law 114–328) and appropriated in the Consolidated Appro-priations Act, 2017 (Public Law 115–31) for funds be applied to chartering a dry dock to meet fleet maintenance requirements in the Western Pacific. (b) L
IMITATION ON USE OF FUNDS.—Not more than 75 percent of the funds authorized to be appropriated or otherwise made available for the Office of the Secretary of the Navy may be obligated or expended until the Secretary sub-mits to Congress notice that a request for pro-posals has been issued to solicit bids for the chartering of a dry dock in the Western Pacific that satisfies the minimum requirements for heavy ship depot-level repair.

SEC. 1066. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING AIR-CRAFT CARRIERS. 
(a) F INDINGS .—Congress makes the following findings: (1) Naval aviation was born in the United States when Eugene Ely launched from the deck of a United States Navy ship on November 14, 1910, in a Curtiss Model D. (2) In 1915, Cpt. Henry C. Mustin made the first catapult launch and first take off in a ship underway in a Curtiss Model AB-2, beginning a century of technological advancements that have led to today’s Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System which has replaced the steam pistons with powerful magnets to launch jet air-craft. (3) In 1924, Lt. Dixie Kiefer made the first night catapult launch in a Vought UO-1 in San Diego harbor, leading to today’s aircraft car-riers being a floating city at sea with a 24-hour airport. (4) The first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, USS Enterprise (CVN 65), was commissioned in 1961, ushering in a new era of the world’s most dominant and capable warships. (5) In 2013, the first of the next generation of aircraft carriers, Gerald R. Ford, was chris-tened, marking a continuation of the innovative naval aviation spirit, technological advance-ment, and war fighting capabilities of aircraft carriers. (6) In 2013, aircraft carrier USS George Wash-ington (CVN 73) provided humanitarian assist-ance, medical supplies, food, and water to the victims in the Philippines of Super Typhoon Haiyan, once again demonstrating versatility of the aircraft carrier for combat, diplomatic and humanitarian operations. (7) For over 70 years, aircraft carriers have been employed in every major and many smaller conflicts, including World War II, Korea, Viet-nam, Grenada, Lebanon, Libya, Operation Desert Storm, Afghanistan, Iraq, and the fight against terrorism. (8) The United States Navy’s aircraft carriers are a cornerstone of the Nation’s ability to project its power and strength. (9) When aircraft carriers sail the globe they are a statement of national purpose and a sym-bol of the Nation’s industrial strength, competi-tive edge, and economic prosperity. (10) Aircraft carriers are 4.5 acres of sovereign United States territory enabling the Nation to reduce its dependency on other nations while it pursues its national security interests. (11) Aircraft carriers enable the United States Armed Forces to carry out operations from inter-national waters, avoiding the complications of securing fly-over rights and land-base rights from other nations. (12) Aircraft carriers are a modern, very mo-bile United States military base complete with airfield, hospital, and communications systems from which the United States can strike at its enemies. (13) Over 90 percent of world trade is moved by sea, including much of the world’s gas and oil supply, and aircraft carriers and their strike forces are constantly on patrol in vital regions of the world to keep shipping lanes open and protect the interests of the United States and its allies. (14) There are more than 2,450 companies in 48 States and over 364 congressional districts, and more than 13,100 shipbuilders who proudly con-tribute to the construction and maintenance of these complex and technologically advanced ships. (15) Thousands of members of the United States Armed Forces have served the Nation aboard aircraft carriers in war, peace, and times of crisis. (16) When crisis occurs the first question that comes to everyone’s lips is ‘‘Where is the nearest carrier?’’. (b) SENSE OF CONGRESS .—It is the sense of Congress that— (1) United States aircraft carriers are the pre-eminent power projection platform and have served the Nation’s interests in times of war and in times of peace, adapting to the immediate and ever-changing nature of the world for over 90 years; (2) aircraft carrier contributions and heritage should be celebrated; and (3) the people of the United States should be encouraged to celebrate the history of aircraft carriers in the United States and to always re-member the vital role these vessels play in de-fending the Nation’s freedom.

(3) The Navy Seabees dual-role is exemplified by the Seabee motto Construimus, Batuimus: We Build, We Fight. (4) Throughout their history, the Navy Sea-bees have answered the call of duty to protect the United States and its democratic values both in times of war and peace.

(8) The Navy Seabees continue to display strength, professionalism, and bravery in the all-volunteer force. (b) SENSE OF CONGRESS .—Congress recognizes the United States Navy Seabees and the Navy personnel who comprise the construction force for the Navy and the Marine Corps as critical elements in deterring conflict, overcoming ag-gression, and rebuilding democratic institutions. 
SEC. 1069. RECOGNITION OF THE UNITED STATES SPECIAL OPERATIONS COMMAND. 
(a) F INDINGS .—Congress makes the following findings: (1) On April 16, 1987, Congress required the es-tablishment of a Special Operations Command, which was to be an elite fighting force drawn from all of the branches of the Armed Forces. (2) As a headquarters organization, USSOCOM comprises four service-component commands, consisting of the United States Army Special Operations Command, United States Naval Special Warfare Command, United States Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Com-mand, and United States Air Force Special Op-erations Command, and includes various sub- unified commands.

(5) USSOCOM has an unequaled ability to analyze and respond to terrorist threats and USSOCOM has led many successful missions globally. (6) Many USSOCOM missions are classified, so the American people may never know the de-tails and extent of the bravery of Special Oper-ations Forces, but a sample of missions provide a glimpse into the bravery and talents of these members of the Armed Forces: (A) On May 2, 2011, Osama bin Laden was killed in a special operations mission in Paki-stan, for which the outstanding men and women in America’s intelligence and Armed Forces, es-pecially those from SOCOM, remained focused on bringing Osama bin Laden to justice, and on May 2, 2011, justice was done. (B) On April 12, 2009, the Maersk Alabama was rescued unharmed in a special operations

(7) Approximately 70,000 Regular component, National Guard, and reserve component per-sonnel from all four services and Department of Defense civilians are assigned to USSOCOM headquarters in Tampa, its four service-compo-nent commands, and eight sub-unified com-mands. (8) The heroism, skill, and patriotism of USSOCOM personnel and their families are without parallel. (9) The responsibilities of USSOCOM are growing and its mission is now and will con-tinue to be central to the defense of the United States in future decades. (10) The sacrifices of many, the service of all, and the talents of the Special Operations Forces are cause for confidence and optimism. (b) S
ENSE OF CONGRESS .—It is the sense of Congress that the soldiers, sailors, airmen, Ma-rines, and civilians who, together with their family members, comprise the United States Spe-cial Operations Forces community should be honored for their service and commitment to keeping the United States safe. 
SEC. 1070. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING WORLD WAR I. 
(a) F INDINGS .—Congress makes the following findings: (1) The United States declared war against Germany on April 6, 1917, to redress wrongs, in-cluding Germany’s resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare, violation of United States neutrality, and denial of freedom of the seas to nonbelligerent nations. (2) The United States associated itself with the allied powers of the United Kingdom and its Commonwealth, France and its colonies, Russia, Italy, and Japan to defeat the German Empire (3) The United States Army, consisting of the Regular Army, National Guard, and Reserve Corps, with the addition of volunteers and the draftees of the National Army, underwent a transformation from a frontier constabulary and coastal defense force to a modern land warfare force. (4) Early 20th century military and techno-logical advances resulted in the incorporation of motor transport, aviation, anti-aircraft artillery, tanks, chemical weapons, aircraft carriers, sub-marines and anti-submarine warfare, sonar, un-derwater mines, and other innovations into the military arsenal of the United States. (5) The need to quickly build a military strength of four million soldiers and half a mil-lion sailors required the mobilization of the human resources of the United States, during which members of diverse ethnic groups, races, and creeds, both native-born and immigrant, forged a new American identity. (6) The United States Army maintained its de-fense of American seacoasts, southern border, and overseas possessions, while the Army Amer-ican Expeditionary Forces deployed ‘‘Over There’’ for combat operations in Europe starting in June 1917. (7) By the end of World War I, almost two mil-lion members of the Army served overseas in the American Expeditionary Forces; Whereas, dur-ing World War I, the United States Navy in-creased in strength from approximately 69,000 officers and sailors and 342 vessels to more than 533,000 officers and sailors and 774 vessels. (8) The Navy operated in the Atlantic and Pa-cific Oceans, and the North and Mediterranean Seas in cooperation with allied navies. (9) The Navy began the fight against the Ger-man U-boat menace by dispatching destroyers, which eventually totaled 70 in number, and 169 other vessels to counter the submarine threat. (10) Navy vessels escorted troop transports carrying 1,250,000 passengers and escorted sup-ply transports carrying 27 percent of all cargo shipped to Europe. (11) The Navy deployed five batteries of large- caliber battleship guns mounted on railroad trains to France for service as long-range artil-lery for the Army;. (12) The United States Coast Guard trans-ferred to the operational control of the Navy, and augmented that service with approximately 5,000 officers and sailors, 47 vessels of all types, and 279 shore stations;. (13) The United States Marine Corps, with an eventual wartime strength of 75,000 officers and men, detached two regiments and a machine gun battalion to constitute an infantry brigade integrated into the Army’s 2d Division for serv-ice in France;. (14) On July 4, 1917, Colonel Charles E. Stan-ton, one of the officers on the staff of General John Pershing, commander of the American Ex-peditionary Forces in Europe, famously an-nounced America’s commitment to the fight when Colonel Stanton proclaimed upon his ar-rival in France, ‘‘Lafayette, we are here!’’. (15) Whereas the American Expeditionary Forces formed three field armies, nine corps and forty-three divisions, plus various units of the Services of Supply. (16) The American Expeditionary Forces suf-fered 244,000 casualties in fighting in thirteen named campaigns in World War I;. (17) Participation in World War I resulted in the completion of a period of reform and profes-sionalism that transformed the Armed Forces from a small dispersed organization to a modern industrialized fighting force capable of global reach and influence. (b) S
ENSE OF CONGRESS .—Congress— (1) honors the memory of the fallen heroes who wore the uniform of the United States Armed Forces during World War I; (2) commends the Unites States Armed Forces for preserving and protecting the interests of the United States during World War I; (3) commends the brave members of the United States Armed Forces for their efforts in ‘‘making the world safe for democracy,’’ and preserving the founding principles of the United States at home and abroad during World War I; (4) commends the brave members of the United States Armed Forces for preserving and pro-tecting the sea lanes of commerce and commu-nications during World War I that ensured the continued prosperity of the United States; (5) celebrates and congratulates the United States Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, and Coast Guard during the commemoration of the centennial of World War I for a job well done; and (6) calls on all people of the United States to join in the commemoration of the centennial of World War I in events throughout the United States and overseas. 
SEC. 1071. FINDINGS AND SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE NATIONAL GUARD YOUTH CHALLENGE PROGRAM. 
(a) F INDINGS .—Congress finds the following: (1) Fewer than 30 percent of youth in the United States qualify for military service, either because of poor physical health, a criminal record, or lack of a high school degree. (2) The National Guard Youth Challenge Pro-gram provides the Department of Defense an op-portunity to work with State and local govern-ments to engage with the youth of the nation, providing military-based training, the oppor-tunity to earn a high school degree, and high physical fitness standards. (b) SENSE OF CONGRESS .—It is the sense of Congress that it is critical to allocate the nec-essary resources to the National Guard Youth Challenge Program of the Department of De-fense as it plays a critical role in preparing the next generation of qualified youth for military service.

(3) While the award of the Badge of Military Merit ceased with the end of the Revolutionary War, the Purple Heart medal was authorized in 1932 as the official successor decoration to the Badge of Military Merit. (4) The Purple Heart medal is the oldest United States military decoration in present use.

(a) F INDINGS .—Congress makes the following findings: (1) The Russian Federation, under the leader-ship of President Vladimir Putin, continues to demonstrate its malign activities to expand its sphere of influence and undermine international norms and institutions both regionally and glob-ally, including through the following activities: (A) An assessment of the United States intel-ligence community stated ‘‘. . .Russian Presi-dent Vladimir Putin ordered an influence cam-paign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential election’’, presented in the intelligence commu-nity’s January 6, 2017, declassified report, ‘‘As-sessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Re-cent U.S. Elections’’. (B) The Russian Federation has interfered in the April 2017 election and runoff election in May 2017 of the French Presidential elections. As confirmed by Admiral Mike Rogers, Director of the National Security Agency, at a Senate Committee on Armed Services hearing on May 9, 2017, ‘‘If you look at the French elections . . . we had become aware of Russian activity.’’ (C) The Russian Federation has threatened stability in their sphere of influence. As stated by General Curtis M. Scaparrotti, Commander of the United States European Command, in testi-mony at a House Committee on Armed Services hearing on March 28, 2017, ‘‘In the east, a re-surgent Russia has turned from partner to an-tagonist. Countries along Russia’s periphery, es-pecially Ukraine and Georgia, are under threat from Moscow’s malign influence and military aggression.’’. (D) The Russian Federation has occupied and attempted to annex Crimea from Ukraine. (E) The Russian Federation has employed hy-brid warfare tactics, including cyber warfare, electronic warfare, and information warfare to gain influence. This includes the use of hybrid tactics in assisting combined Russian-separatist forces in eastern Ukraine and, in 2008, the Rus-sian incursion in Georgia. (F) Military intervention in the civil war in Syria. (2) Both the Secretary of Defense, James Mattis, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Joseph Dunford, highlight the Russian Federation as the number one geo-stra-tegic threat to the United States. (3) The Government of the Russian Federation continues its decades’ long modernization of its conventional military force with the buildup of large numbers of professionalized forces on Rus-sia’s borders with Europe, re-establishing mili-tary presence in the Arctic, investment in its nu-clear triad, advanced weapons systems, fighter jets, and naval vessels.

SEC. 1236. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON IMPORTANCE OF NUCLEAR CAPABILITIES OF NATO. 
(a) F INDINGS .—Congress finds the following: (1) The Warsaw Summit Communique, issued on July 9, 2016, by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (in this section referred to as ‘‘NATO’’) clearly defines the need for, and the importance of, the nuclear mission of NATO. (2) The Warsaw Summit Communique states— (A) with respect to the nuclear deterrence ca-pability of NATO, ‘‘As a means to prevent con-flict and war, credible deterrence and defence is essential. Therefore, deterrence and defence, based on an appropriate mix of nuclear, conven-tional, and missile defence capabilities, remains a core element of our overall strategy. . . The fundamental purpose of NATO’s nuclear capa-bility is to preserve peace, prevent coercion, and deter aggression. Nuclear weapons are unique. Any employment of nuclear weapons against NATO would fundamentally alter the nature of a conflict. The circumstances in which NATO might have to use nuclear weapons are ex-tremely remote’’; (B) with respect to the nature of the nuclear deterrence posture of NATO, ‘‘NATO must con-tinue to adapt its strategy in line with trends in the security environment–including with respect to capabilities and other measures required–to ensure that NATO’s overall deterrence and defence posture is capable of addressing poten-tial adversaries’ doctrine and capabilities, and that it remains credible, flexible, resilient, and adaptable.’’; and (C) with respect to the importance of contribu-tions to the nuclear deterrence mission from across the NATO alliance, ‘‘The strategic forces of the Alliance, particularly those of the United States, are the supreme guarantee of the secu-rity of the Allies. The independent strategic nu-clear forces of the United Kingdom and France have a deterrent role of their own and con-tribute to the overall security of the Alliance. These Allies’ separate centres of decision-mak-ing contribute to deterrence by complicating the calculations of potential adversaries. NATO’s nuclear deterrence posture also relies, in part, on United States’ nuclear weapons forward-de-ployed in Europe and on capabilities and infra-structure provided by Allies concerned. These Allies will ensure that all components of NATO’s nuclear deterrent remain safe, secure, and effective. That requires sustained leader-ship focus and institutional excellence for the nuclear deterrence mission and planning guid-ance aligned with 21st century requirements. The Alliance will ensure the broadest possible participation of Allies concerned in their agreed nuclear burden-sharing arrangements.’’. (3) Secretary of Defense James Mattis, in re-sponse to the advance policy questions for his Senate confirmation hearing on January 12, 2017, stated that— (A) ‘‘NATO’s nuclear deterrence posture relies in part on U.S. nuclear weapons forward-de-ployed in Europe and on capabilities and infra-structure provided by NATO allies. These capa-bilities include dual-capable aircraft that con-tribute to current burden-sharing arrangements within NATO. In general, we must take care to maintain this particular capability, and to mod-ernize it appropriately and in a timely fash-ion.’’; and (B) the role of the nuclear weapons of the United States is ‘‘to deter nuclear war and to serve as last resort weapons of self-defense. In this sense, U.S. nuclear weapons are funda-mental to our nation’s security and have his-torically provided a deterrent against aggression and security assurance to U.S. allies. A robust, flexible, and survivable U.S. nuclear arsenal un-derpins the U.S. ability to deploy conventional forces worldwide.’’. (4) On March 28, 2017, General Curtis Scaparrotti, Commander of the United States European Command and the Supreme Allied Commander, Europe, testified to the Committee on Armed Services of the House of Representa-tives that ‘‘NATO and U.S. nuclear forces con-tinue to be a vital component of our deterrence. Our modernization efforts are crucial; we must preserve a ready, credible, and safe nuclear ca-pability.’’. (5) The Russian Federation is currently un-dergoing significant modernization and recapi-talization of all three legs of its nuclear triad, continues to field and modernize a large variety of non-strategic nuclear weapons, and is devel-oping and deploying new and unique nuclear capabilities. (6) Russia remains in violation of the INF Treaty due to the development, testing, and, most recently, the operational deployment of ground-launched cruise missiles in violation of the INF Treaty.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH5596 July 12, 2017 
(7) On March 28, 2017, General Paul Selva, Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, de-scribed the security consequences of the deploy-ment of such INF Treaty-violating missiles, tes-tifying to the Committee on Armed Services of the House of Representatives that ‘‘our assess-ment of the impact is that it more threatens NATO and infrastructure within the European continent than any other...area of the world that we have national interests in or alliance in-terests in.’’. (8) On March 28, 2017, General Curtis Scaparrotti, in testimony before the Committee on Armed Services of the House of Representa-tives, responded to a question asking if Russia intends to return to compliance with the INF Treaty by stating, ‘‘I don’t have any indication that they will at this time.’’. (9) Rhetoric from Russian officials has dem-onstrated that Moscow has sought to leverage its nuclear arsenal to threaten and intimidate neighboring countries, including members of NATO, as was the case when the Russian Am-bassador to Denmark stated, ‘‘Danish warships will be targets for Russian nuclear missiles’’ in response to Denmark’s potential cooperation in the NATO missile defense system. (b) S
ENSE OF CONGRESS .—It is the sense of Congress that— (1) the nuclear and conventional deterrence capabilities of NATO are of critical importance to the security of the United States and of the NATO alliance, and must continue to adapt to the changed security environment in Europe; (2) the ability of the United States to forward- deploy dual-capable aircraft and nuclear weap-ons, and of select members of NATO to partici-pate in the nuclear deterrence mission of NATO by hosting forward-deployed nuclear weapons of the United States or operating dual-capable aircraft, is central to the credibility of the nu-clear deterrence and defense posture of NATO; (3) the strategic forces of the United States, the independent nuclear forces of the United Kingdom and the French Republic, and the dual-capable aircraft operated by the United States and other members of NATO constitute foundational elements of the nuclear deterrence and defense posture of NATO; (4) NATO should modernize its nuclear-re-lated infrastructure to ensure the highest-level of safety and security; (5) effective deterrence requires NATO to con-duct nuclear planning and exercises aligned with 21st century requirements and modernize nuclear-related capabilities and infrastructure, including dual-capable aircraft, command and control networks, and facilities; and (6) to ensure the continued credibility of the deterrence and defense posture of NATO, the planned completion of F–35A aircraft develop-ment and testing, as well as the delivery of such aircraft to members of NATO, must not be de-layed. (c) INF T
REATY DEFINED .—In this section, the term ‘‘INF Treaty’’ means the Treaty Between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the Elimination of Their Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles, commonly referred to as the ‘‘Intermediate- Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty’’, signed at Washington December 8, 1987, and entered into force June 1, 1988. 
SEC. 1237. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON SUPPORT FOR GEORGIA. 
(a) F INDINGS .—Congress finds the following: (1) Georgia is a valued friend of the United States and has repeatedly demonstrated its com-mitment to advancing the mutual interests of both countries, including the deployment of Georgian forces as part of the NATO-led Inter-national Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan and the Multi-National Force in Iraq. (2) The European Deterrence Initiative builds the partnership capacity of Georgia so it can work more closely with the United States and NATO, as well as provide for its own defense. (3) In addition to the European Deterrence Initiative, Georgia’s participation in the NATO initiative Partnership for Peace is paramount to interoperability with the United States and NATO, and establishing a more peaceful envi-ronment in the region. (4) Despite the losses suffered, as a NATO partner of ISAF, Georgia is engaged in the Res-olute Support Mission in Afghanistan with the second largest contingent on the ground. (b) SENSE OF CONGRESS .—Congress— (1) reaffirms United States support for Geor-gia’s sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally-recognized borders, and does not recognize the independence of the Abkhazia and South Ossetia regions currently occupied by the Russian Federation; and (2) supports continued cooperation between the United States and Georgia and the efforts of the Government of Georgia to provide for the de-fense of its people and sovereign territory. 
SEC. 1238. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON SUPPORT FOR ESTONIA, LATVIA, AND LITH-UANIA. 
(a) F INDINGS .—Congress finds the following: (1) The Baltic States of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania are highly valued allies of the United States, and they have repeatedly demonstrated their commitment to advancing our mutual in-terests as well as those of the NATO Alliance. (2) Operation Atlantic Resolve is a series of exercises and coordinating efforts demonstrating the United States’ commitment to its European partners and allies, including the Baltic States of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, with the shared goal of peace and stability in the region. Operation Atlantic Resolve strengthens commu-nication and understanding, and is an impor-tant effort to deter Russian aggression in the re-gion. (3) Through Operation Atlantic Resolve, the European Deterrence Initiative undertakes exer-cises, training, and rotational presence nec-essary to reassure and integrate our allies, in-cluding the Baltic States, into a common defense framework. (4) All three Baltic States contributed to the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan, sending disproportionate numbers of troops and operating with few cave-ats. The Baltic States continue to engage in Op-eration Resolute Support in Afghanistan. (b) S
ENSE OF CONGRESS .—Congress— (1) reaffirms its support for the principle of collective defense in Article 5 of the North At-lantic Treaty for our NATO allies, including Es-tonia, Latvia, and Lithuania; (2) supports the sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity, and inviolability of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania as well as their inter-nationally recognized borders, and expresses concerns over increasingly aggressive military maneuvering by the Russian Federation near their borders and airspace; (3) expresses concern over and condemns sub-versive and destabilizing activities by the Rus-sian Federation within the Baltic States; and (4) encourages the Administration to further enhance defense cooperation efforts with Esto-nia, Latvia, and Lithuania and supports the ef-forts of their Governments to provide for the de-fense of their people and sovereign territory. Subtitle E—Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty Preservation Act of 2017 
SEC. 1241. SHORT TITLE. 
This subtitle may be cited as the ‘‘Inter-mediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty Preservation Act of 2017’’. 
SEC. 1242. FINDINGS. 
Congress makes the following findings: (1) The 2014, 2015, and 2016 Department of State reports entitled, ‘‘Adherence to and Com-pliance with Arms Control, Nonproliferation, and Disarmament Agreements and Commit-ments’’, all stated that the United States has de-termined that ‘‘the Russian Federation is in vio-lation of its obligations under the INF Treaty not to possess, produce, or flight-test a ground- launched cruise missile (GLCM) with a range capability of 500 km to 5,500 km, or to possess or produce launchers of such missiles’’. (2) The 2016 report also noted that ‘‘the cruise missile developed by Russia meets the INF Trea-ty definition of a ground-launched cruise missile with a range capability of 500 km to 5,500 km, and as such, all missiles of that type, and all launchers of the type used or tested to launch such a missile, are prohibited under the provi-sions of the INF Treaty’’. (3) Potential consistency and compliance con-cerns regarding the INF Treaty noncompliant GLCM have existed since 2008, were not offi-cially raised with the Russian Federation until 2013, and were not briefed to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) until January 2014. (4) The United States Government is aware of other consistency and compliance concerns re-garding Russia actions vis-a`-vis its INF Treaty obligations. (5) Since 2013, senior United States officials, including the President, the Secretary of State, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, have raised Russian noncompliance with the INF Treaty to their counterparts, but no progress has been made in bringing the Russian Federation back into compliance with the INF Treaty. (6) In April 2014, General Breedlove, the Su-preme Allied Commander Europe, correctly stat-ed, ‘‘A weapon capability that violates the INF, that is introduced into the greater European land mass, is absolutely a tool that will have to be dealt with . . . It can’t go unanswered.’’. (7) The Department of Defense in its Sep-tember 2013 report, Report on Conventional Prompt Global Strike Options if Exempt from the Restrictions of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty Between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Re-publics, stated that it has multiple validated military requirement gaps due to the prohibi-tions imposed on the United States as a result of its compliance with the INF Treaty. (8) It is not in the national security interests of the United States to be unilaterally legally prohibited from developing dual-capable ground-launched cruise missiles with ranges be-tween 500 and 5,500 kilometers, while Russia makes advances in developing and fielding this class of weapon systems, and such unilateral limitation cannot be allowed to continue indefi-nitely. (9) Admiral Harry Harris, Jr., Commander of the United States Pacific Command, testified be-fore the Senate Armed Services Committee on April 27, 2017, that ‘‘[W]e’re in a multi-polar world where we have a lot of countries who are developing these weapons, including China, that I worry about. And I worry about their DF-21 and DF-26 missile programs, their anti- carrier ballistic missile programs, if you will. INF doesn’t address missiles launched from ships or airplanes, but it focuses on those land- based systems. I think there’s goodness in the INF treaty, anything you can do to limit nu-clear weapons writ-large is generally good. But the aspects of the INF Treaty that limit our ability to counter Chinese and other countries’ land-based missiles, I think, is problematic.’’. (10) A material breach of the INF Treaty by the Russian Federation affords the United States the right to invoke legal countermeasures which include suspension of the treaty in whole or in part. (11) Article XV of the INF Treaty provides that ‘‘Each Party shall, in exercising its na-tional sovereignty, have the right to withdraw from this Treaty if it decides that extraordinary events related to the subject matter of this Trea-ty have jeopardized its supreme interests.’’.

SEC. 1251. SHORT TITLE. 
This subtitle may be cited as the ‘‘Fostering Unity Against Russian Aggression Act of 2017’’. 
SEC. 1252. FINDINGS AND SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
(a) F INDINGS .—Congress finds the following: (1) General Curtis M. Scaparrotti, Commander of the United States European Command, testi-fied before the House Armed Services Committee on March 27, 2017, that ‘‘Today we face the most dynamic European security environment in history.’’ and that ‘‘Russia’s malign actions are supported by its diplomatic, information, eco-nomic, and military initiatives.’’. (2) The Russian Federation has shifted to a military doctrine that envisions using nuclear weapons in an attempt to end a failing regional conventional conflict. On June 25, 2015, Deputy Secretary of Defense Robert Work and then- Vice-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Ad-miral James Winnefeld testified before the House Armed Services Committee that ‘‘Russian mili-tary doctrine includes what some have called an ‘escalate to de-escalate’ strategy—a strategy that purportedly seeks to deescalate a conven-tional conflict through coercive threats, includ-ing limited nuclear use. We think that this label is dangerously misleading. Anyone who thinks they can control escalation through the use of nuclear weapons is literally playing with fire. Escalation is escalation, and nuclear use would be the ultimate escalation.’’. (3) General Scaparrotti noted in his March 27, 2017, testimony before the House Armed Services Committee that ‘‘Moscow’s provocative rhetoric and nuclear threats increase the likelihood of misunderstanding and miscalculation.’’. (4) The Russian Federation continues to con-duct ongoing influence campaigns aimed at un-dermining democracies around the world. Ac-cording to an assessment by the intelligence community, ‘‘Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential election’’, which included the use of the Russian military intelligence or-ganization. The intelligence community also as-sessed that Russia would apply lessons learned

to future influence efforts worldwide, including against United States allies and their election systems. (5) The Russian Federation continues its ag-gression on its periphery. In 2008, the Russian Federation fomented conflict in Georgia. Fur-ther, the Russian Federation is directing com-bined Russian-Separatist units in eastern Ukraine, actively inciting violence and pro-longing the most significant conflict in Europe. (6) The investment of over $5 billion in the Eu-ropean Reassurance Initiative (ERI), now the European Deterrence Initiative (EDI), has prov-en successful in significantly enhancing the ability of United States forces, NATO allies, and regional partners to deter Russian aggression. EDI has not only assured our European allies and partners but supported essential invest-ments in NATO’s military capacity, interoper-ability, and agility. (b) S
ENSE OF CONGRESS .—It is the sense of Congress that— (1) the risks of miscalculation in a crisis are exacerbated by the Russian Federation’s shift to a military doctrine of ‘‘escalate to de-escalate’’, lowering the threshold for Russian use of nu-clear weapons and thereby increasing the risk of using nuclear weapons, potentially escalating in to a massive nuclear exchange; (2) subversive and destabilizing activities by the Russian Federation targeting NATO allies and partners causes concern and should be con-demned; (3) European Deterrence Initiative (EDI) in-vestments are long-term and, as such, Congress expects future budgets to reflect United States commitment by planning for funding in the base budget, and further EDI should build on United States presence by increasing the United States permanent force posture; and (4) credible deterrence requires steadfast co-operation and joint action with NATO allies and partners and other United States allies and partners in Europe.

SEC. 1264. EXTENDED DETERRENCE COMMIT-MENT TO THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION. 
(a) F INDINGS .—Congress finds the following: (1) The 2010 Nuclear Posture Review re-affirmed the commitment of the United States to extended deterrence and continued protection of the treaty allies of the United States under the United States nuclear umbrella. (2) The United States-Republic of Korea De-terrence Strategy Committee and the United States-Japan Extended Deterrence Dialogue pro-vide valuable communication channels for en-suring the commitment of the United States to the policy of extended nuclear deterrence and allow for bilateral discussions on how United States capabilities can be leveraged to credibly deter, and if necessary, defeat, North Korean nuclear weapons, weapons of mass destruction, and missile threats and aggression. (3) Statements by officials of the United States have consistently emphasized the United States commitment to providing extended deterrence and defense across the full spectrum of military capabilities, including nuclear capabilities. (4) On September 9, 2016, President Obama re-sponded to a North Korean nuclear test by issuing the following statement, ‘‘I restated to President Park and Prime Minister Abe the unshakable U.S. commitment to take necessary steps to defend our allies in the region, includ-ing through our deployment of a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) battery to the ROK, and the commitment to extended deter-rence, guaranteed by the full spectrum of U.S. defense capabilities.’’. (5) On October 14, 2016, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Joseph Dunford, ‘‘re-affirmed the ironclad commitment of the U.S. to defend both the ROK and Japan and provide extended deterrence guaranteed by the full spec-trum of U.S. military capabilities, including conventional, nuclear, and missile defense capa-bilities’’. (6) On October 19, 2016, Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter, stated, ‘‘the U.S. commitment to the defense of South Korea is unwavering. This includes our commitment to provide extended deterrence, guaranteed by the full spectrum of U.S. defense capabilities. Make no mistake: Any attack on America or our allies will not only be defeated, but any use of nuclear weapons will be met with an overwhelming and effective re-sponse.’’. (7) On October 19, 2016, Secretary of State John Kerry, during a joint press conference with the South Korean Foreign Minister, confirmed the United States would ‘‘defend South Korea through a robust combined defense posture and through extended deterrence, including the US nuclear umbrella, conventional strike and mis-sile defense capabilities.’’. (8) On February 3, 2017, Secretary of Defense James Mattis, during a visit to South Korea, stated, ‘‘America’s commitments to defending our allies and to upholding our extended deter-rence guarantees remain ironclad: Any attack on the United States, or our allies, will be de-feated, and any use of nuclear weapons would be met with a response that would be effective and overwhelming.’’. (b) SENSE OF CONGRESS .—It is the sense of Congress that— (1) the defense of the Republic of Korea and Japan must remain a top priority for the admin-istration; (2) the United States maintains an unwaver-ing and steadfast commitment to the policy of extended deterrence, especially with respect to South Korea and Japan; (3) bilateral extended deterrence dialogues and discussions with South Korea and Japan are of great value to the United States and its partners and must remain a central component of these relationships; (4) the United States must sustain and mod-ernize current United States nuclear capabilities to ensure the extended deterrence commitments of the United States remain credible and execut-able; and (5) the timely development, production, and deployment of modern nuclear-capable aircraft are fundamental to ensure that the United States remains able to meet extended deterrence requirements in the Asia-Pacific region far into the future.

SEC. 1685. DEFENSE OF HAWAII FROM NORTH KO-REAN BALLISTIC MISSILE ATTACK. 
(a) F INDINGS ; SENSE OF CONGRESS .— (1) F
INDINGS .—Congress finds the following: (A) The North Korean ballistic missile threat to the United States, including Hawaii, is grow-ing rapidly. (B) Since Kim Jong-un took power in 2012, North Korea has conducted 78 ballistic missile tests, of which 61 are considered to have been successful. (C) The existing ballistic missile defense pro-tection for Hawaii, including the ground-based midcourse defense system in Alaska, and the sea-based x-band radar, provide limited ballistic missile defense capabilities today. (D) Through use of existing ballistic missile defense assets, including AN/TPY–2 radars and the Aegis Ashore Site located on the Pacific Mis-sile Range Facility, the ballistic missile defense of Hawaii could benefit from a near-term im-provement by adding a layer of defense. (E) The proposed program of record for a me-dium range discriminating radar to be fully mis-sion capable after 2023 would leave the defense of Hawaii dependent only on the ground-based midcourse defense system in Alaska, and the sea-based x-band radar until that time, while the threat to the United States, including Ha-waii, from North Korean ballistic missiles con-tinues to grow. (F) The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 (Public Law 114–328) re-quired that the Missile Defense Agency plan to provide additional ballistic missile defense sen-sor coverage for the defense of Hawaii and ‘‘field such radar or equivalent sensor by not later than December 31, 2021’’. (G) When asked at a hearing of the Committee on Armed Services of the House of Representa-tives on April 26, 2017, about the threat to Ha-waii from North Korean ballistic missiles, the Commander of the United States Pacific Com-mand, Admiral Harry Harris, testified that ‘‘Kim Jong-un is clearly in a position to threat-en Hawaii today. . .I believe that our ballistic missile (defense) architecture is sufficient to pro-tect Hawaii today. But it can be overwhelmed’’ and ‘‘I think that we would be better served, my personal opinion, is that we would be better served with a defensive Hawaii radar and inter-ceptors in Hawaii. I know that is being dis-cussed’’. (2) S
ENSE OF CONGRESS .—It is the sense of Congress that Congress supports assessing the feasibility of improving the missile defense of Hawaii from the evolving ballistic missile threat, including from North Korea, through a perma-nent missile defense sensor capability and the possible introduction of interim missile defense coverage. (b) S
EQUENCED APPROACH .—The Secretary of Defense shall protect the test and training oper-ations of the Pacific Missile Range Facility, and assess the siting and functionality of a discrimi-nation radar for homeland defense throughout the Hawaiian Islands before assessing the feasi-bility of improving the missile defense of Hawaii by using existing missile defense assets that could materially improve the defense of Hawaii.

SEC. 3111. NUCLEAR SECURITY ENTERPRISE IN-FRASTRUCTURE RECAPITALIZATION AND REPAIR. 
(a) F INDINGS .—Congress finds the following: (1) On September 7, 2016, during testimony be-fore the Subcommittee on Strategic Forces of the Committee on Armed Services of the House of Representatives— (A) the Administrator for Nuclear Security, Frank Klotz, said— (i) ‘‘Our infrastructure is extensive, complex, and, in many critical areas, several decades old. More than half of NNSA’s approximately 6,000 real property assets are over 40 years old, and nearly 30 percent date back to the Manhattan Project era. Many of the enterprise’s critical utility, safety, and support systems are failing at an increasing and unpredictable rate, which poses both programmatic and safety risk.’’; and (ii) ‘‘I can think of no greater threat to the nuclear security enterprise than the state of NNSA’s infrastructure.’’; (B) the President and Chief Executive Officer of Consolidated Nuclear Security, Morgan Smith, said, ‘‘Many key facilities at both [Pantex and Y–12] were constructed in the 1940s and were intended to operate for as little as one decade. Many facilities and their supporting in-frastructure have exceeded or far exceeded their expected life, and major systems within the fa-cilities are beginning to fail.’’; and (C) the Director of Los Alamos National Lab-oratory, Dr. Charlie McMillan, said, ‘‘One of the things that keeps me up at night is the real-ization that essential capabilities are held at risk by the possibility of such failures; in many cases, our enterprise has a single point of fail-ure.’’. (2) In a letter sent on December 23, 2015, by the Secretary of Energy, Ernest Moniz, to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, Shaun Donovan, the Secretary said, ‘‘A majority of the National Nuclear Security Ad-ministration’s (NNSA) facilities and systems are well beyond end-of-life. . . Infrastructure prob-lems such as falling ceilings are increasing in frequency and severity, unacceptably risking the safety and security of both personnel and material at NNSA facilities, as well as in some instances, potential offsite risks. The entire com-plex could be placed at risk if there is a single failure where a single point would disrupt a critical link in infrastructure.’’. (3) The Nuclear Posture Review published in April 2010 stated that ‘‘In order to sustain a safe, secure, and effective U.S. nuclear stockpile as long as nuclear weapons exist, the United States must possess a modern physical infra-structure. . . Today’s nuclear complex, how-ever, has fallen into neglect. Although substan-tial science, technology, and engineering invest-ments were made over the last decade under the auspices of the Stockpile Stewardship Program, the complex still includes many oversized and costly-to maintain facilities built during the 1940s and 1950s. Some facilities needed for work-ing with plutonium and uranium date back to the Manhattan Project. Safety, security, and environmental issues associated with these aging facilities are mounting, as are the costs of addressing them.’’. (4) In 2009, the bipartisan Congressional Com-mission on the Strategic Posture of the United States established by section 1062 of the Na-tional Defense Authorization for Fiscal Year 2008 (Public Law 110–181; 122 Stat. 319) stated, with regards to key production facilities, that ‘‘existing facilities are genuinely decrepit and are maintained in a safe and secure manner only at high cost’’. (5) Previous efforts to address the deferred maintenance and repair challenges within the nuclear security enterprise, such as the Facili-ties Infrastructure and Recapitalization Pro-gram and the recent halt in the growth of back-log metrics, are laudable but insufficient for the magnitude of the problem. (6) Recent figures provided by the Adminis-trator for Nuclear Security estimate the backlog of deferred maintenance and repair needs of the nuclear security enterprise to be approximately $3,700,000,000. (b) F
ACILITIES AND INFRASTRUCTURE RECAPI -
TALIZATION AND REPAIR PROGRAM .— (1) E
STABLISHMENT .—Not later than 30 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Administrator for Nuclear Security shall estab-lish and carry out a program known as the Fa-cilities and Infrastructure Recapitalization and Repair Program to reduce the backlog of de-ferred maintenance and repair needs of the nu-clear security enterprise (as defined in section 4002(6) of the Atomic Energy Defense Act (50 U.S.C. 2501(6)). The Administrator shall ensure that, by not later than five years after the date of the enactment of this Act, the program achieves the goal of reducing such backlog of deferred maintenance and repair needs by 50 percent.

Yet the DOE laboratories and DOD contractor community have done little integrated design and development work outside of life extension for 25 years, let alone concept development that could serve as a hedge to surprise.’’ (B) ‘‘The Defense Science Board believes that the triad’s complementary features remain ro-bust tenets for the design of a future force. Re-placing our current, aging force is essential, but not sufficient in the more complex nuclear envi-ronment we now face to provide the adaptability or flexibility to confidently hold at risk what adversaries value. In particular, if the threat evolves in ways that favorably change the cost/ benefit calculus in the view of an adversary’s leadership, then we should be in a position to quickly restore a credible deterrence posture.’’ (3) In a memorandum dated May 9, 2014, then- Secretary of Energy Ernie Moniz said: (A) ‘‘If nuclear military capabilities are to provide deterrence for the nation they need to be relevant to the emerging global strategic envi-ronment. The current stockpile was designed to meet the needs of a bipolar world with roots in the Cold War era. A more complex, chaotic, and dynamic security environment is emerging. In order to uphold the Department’s mission to en-sure an effective nuclear deterrent... we must

ensure our nuclear capabilities meet the chal-lenges of known and potential geopolitical and technological trends. Therefore we must look ahead, using the expertise of our laboratories, to how the capabilities that may be employed by other nations could impact deterrence over the next several decades.’’ (B) ‘‘We must challenge our thinking about our programs of record in order to permit fore-sighted actions that may reduce, in the coming decades, the chances for surprise and that but-tress deterrence.’’ (b) D

The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Reso-lution 431, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. C
ONAWAY ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chairman, this amendment is a pretty straightforward amendment. It does two things. One, it saves and conserves valuable taxpayer dollars to be used on higher priority issues, and it holds the Department of Defense accountable for current law. Mr. Chairman, we currently have in place a variety of agreements with folks who buy biofuels at costs ranging up to $28 a gallon. The Army actually bought some at $40 a gallon. At a time when you have heard, for over an hour now, the need for conserving resources, for reprioritizing resources, having those kind of contracts, new contracts come in existence makes no sense whatsoever. This amendment would simply say that while sequestration is going on, while we are under the draconian meas-ures of sequestration, the Army, De-partment of Defense, Navy, Air Force will not enter into new contracts. Ex-isting contracts, wherever they may be, however costly they might be, would continue forward, we would honor those and the amendments made in that regard. But as long as we are under seques-tration and we are under this budg-eting process that you have heard ad nauseam over the last hour or so, these would prevent this problem from going forward. Then if sequestration goes away on its own or we somehow lift it ourselves, then this restriction would be lifted and then new contracts could be en-tered into, but those contracts would then have an accounting clause in it, or the accounting department at the Pentagon would have an accounting process in which the cost of the fuels would have to take into account all of the other agencies who have been con-tributing to this fund. Early on, there was a $510 million pot of money created by the Department of Defense, the Department of Energy, and the Department of Agriculture, using the Commodities Credit Corpora-tion to fund this $510 million. None of us know where that money went. It was supposed to do a refinery, but we don’t know that. We can’t prove that. We do know that they bought jet fuel at $28 a gallon under this program. Normally, at that same timeframe, they also bought jet fuel for $3.35 a gal-lon. So 25 bucks a gallon differential, 2 million gallons bought at the higher prices, that is $51 million of taxpayer dollars that were, I believe, misapplied and misprioritized in these tough times. This program came into existence, in no small part, because of America’s re-liance on overseas sources of oil. This all predates the last 6 years of effort that has gone on in order to create the energy independence that we see on the horizon, given shale drilling and all of the opportunity to use these cheaper fuels. So I ask my colleagues to support the amendment. This makes sense. It does not squander taxpayer resources. It does not affect existing contracts. It would only be for new contracts. The industry itself, of course, is going to be for it because they are selling a com-modity at $28 a gallon versus $3 a gal-lon, and you would expect them to be against my amendment. But my amendment is for the servicemen and -women and for the taxpayers. Mr. Chair, I encourage a ‘‘yes’’ vote, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment. The CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Chair, before I proceed, I wanted to take a quick few seconds to thank and recognize Chair-man T
HORNBERRY and Ranking Member S
MITH as a freshman member of the 115th Congress. It has been refreshing to see such bipartisan tone in leader-ship, so I just wanted to recognize them for those qualities and skills. With the Department of Defense struggling to rein in spending while keeping our military strong and our country protected, it is amendments like Mr. C
ONAWAY ’s that are unneces-sarily impeding cost competition and reductions that come with public-pri-vate partnerships. This amendment limits competition between alternative fuel sources and may even force DOD to pay more by ex-plicitly prohibiting purchases of cheap-er fuel. That is not only inefficient, it is irresponsible. The Department of Defense is the single largest energy consumer in the world. We should be incentivizing the diversification of liquid fuels as an op-tion to bring down costs and reduce regulatory burden. Not only does this amendment risk increased costs for DOD procurement, but it also stunts potential economic growth in the rapidly expanding biofuel field, a billion-dollar industry world-wide. Yet another troubling result of this amendment, if passed, is its potential to impede military operations where an alternative fuel may be the only option available. It is unethical to endanger our men and women in uniform with this ban, and, at the very least, a waiver should be included for national security mat-ters. Military leaders and experts have told Armed Services Committee mem-bers time and time again about the di-rect threat that climate change, par-ticularly sea level rise, poses to our military operations and installations both at home in places like Norfolk and abroad. My colleague, Mr. L
ANGEVIN , in-cluded language in this year’s NDAA that specifically acknowledges this threat. It directs the Defense Depart-ment to study the impact of climate change and prepare an effective strat-egy to address its effects. We have long known that carbon pol-lution and fossil fuels are heavily con-tributing to a changing climate and the extreme weather patterns that ac-company this phenomenon. It is irre-sponsible for this Congress to ignore this reality and not even consider cost- effective and more clean energy sources for our military. Finally, I would like to point out that this amendment is completely un-necessary. Current law already pro-hibits DOD from purchasing alter-native fuel in large quantities unless it is cost-competitive with traditional fuel. I urge my colleagues to oppose this misguided amendment that does far more harm than good to our De-fense Department and to our service-members. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chair, how much time do I have? The CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas has 2 minutes remaining. Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chair, the gen-tleman is incorrect in the sense that this does not, over the next year or 2 or 3, however long sequestration is going to be in place, measurably affect cli-mate change one way or the other. The small amounts of fuel that are allowed to be purchased in excess of competi-tive costs are 2 million gallons at 28 bucks a gallon. The Department of Defense buys 107 billion gallons of fuel, so any number up to some multimillion dollar num-ber, million gallon amount could be hidden under this amount. We also don’t have a good accounting process to understand exactly what those costs are when they enter into these con-tracts, and asking the Department of Agriculture to subsidize this process doesn’t make any sense either. In order to hide from the program, the issue is the Department of Defense buys the fuel, they send a bill to the Commodities Credit Corporation to ac-tually pay for it. So it is not even on the Department of Defense’s books and records to get the proper accounting to make sure. This is straightforward stuff. You can’t, on the one hand, argue that we need to provide all that needs to be provided for our men and women to fight and spend an extra $51 billion, plus $510 million that we don’t know where that went on a product that can be brought for $3.35 a gallon. I would argue there is nowhere in the world today where we need drop-in jet fuel that can be provided somewhere else. That argument is specious and it makes no sense whatsoever. That may be some future issue, but that is not today. Giving the shale drilling and the op-portunity to provide fossil fuels for our military and their direct mission of fighting, not doing the other things to try to support this issue, makes no

sense. So I ask my colleagues to vote for this commonsense amendment. It does not affect the existing contracts, and it is a better use of taxpayer dol-lars, and it is better for the members of the service to put a hiatus on new con-tracts while we are under sequestration and all of the things that have been talked about. So I encourage my colleagues to sup-port the amendment. And with that, I yield to the chairman for any com-ments he might have. The CHAIR. The time of the gen-tleman from Texas has expired. Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Chair, I will point out that those figures are incor-rect as stated by my colleague. In 2015, the DOD paid $2.03 for 77,660 gallons of fuel at a 10 percent blend. I just wanted to correct the record be-cause those are the accurate figures, and I think those figures speak vol-umes. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. C
ONAWAY ). The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the ayes ap-peared to have it. Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote. The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas will be postponed. It is now in order to consider amend-ment No. 3 printed in part B of House report 115–212.

(a) R EDUCTION .—Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, but subject to subsection (b), the President, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Energy, and the Administrator for Nu-clear Security, shall make such reductions in the amounts authorized to be appro-priated under this Act in such manner as the President considers appropriate to achieve an aggregate reduction of 1 percent of the total amount of funds authorized to be ap-propriated under this Act. Such reduction shall be in addition to any other reduction of funds required by law. (b) E
XCLUSIONS .—In carrying out sub-section (a), the President shall not reduce the amount of funds for the following ac-counts: (1) Military personnel, reserve personnel, and National Guard personnel accounts of the Department of Defense. (2) The Defense Health Program account. 
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Reso-lution 431, the gentleman from Colo-rado (Mr. P
OLIS) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I might consume. Mr. Chairman, at a time when we need to balance our budget and prevent a legacy of debt from being left to the next generation, it is really time to ask ourselves: Not only should we blast through the budget caps, but can’t we afford to at least make a small and im-portant step towards protecting our fiscal security as a nation, which is a critical part of our national security? By spending beyond our means, we make ourselves economically beholden to other nations like China and Saudi Arabia. That makes America less se-cure rather than more secure. As structured, the NDAA is fiscally irresponsible. We have had a number of discussions about that, that outside of the context of a full budget discussion, it is hard to talk about exceeding the Budget Control Act by 72.5 billion, an additional $10 billion of base spending. It is a broader discussion about the budget that needs to be had. What my amendment would do, very simply, Mr. Chairman, is give author-ity to the President of the United States and the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Energy to reduce the overall amount of money author-ized in this bill by 1 percent. It excludes personnel and health ac-counts from being included in these re-ductions. A 1 percent reduction still leaves us well above the original De-fense cap spending levels that I actu-ally support. b2045 If I had my way, I would keep those budget numbers for defense spending, but I think this 1 percent is a very rea-sonable compromise for those of us who believe that we need to at least show a symbolic gesture towards fiscal respon-sibility as we head into the budget ne-gotiations. In this bill, there are many over-funded accounts. Accounts are funded at levels above and beyond what our own military requested. A 1 percent re-duction in that context is extremely reasonable. It is $6.2 billion out of this bill. I have no doubt that there are many ways to find the excess money in the bill that we would leave up to the military to reach that spending level. We can consider numerous programs. This doesn’t have to be across the board. We can consider programs where the bill authorizes procurement levels that exceed the President’s request and the military’s request. My colleague from Massachusetts pointed this out during the bill’s markup when he intro-duced an amendment to reduce the number of littoral combat ships from three to the Navy’s own request of one. We are effectively blocking the Navy from making a fiscally reasonable deci-sion. There are dozens more—helicopters, aircraft, and missiles—than the Presi-dent even requested in his budget. So we are not going to cut every one of those items. Many of them have found their way onto the unfunded priority list which the Pentagon provides the Congress. In a perfect world, if we had all the money in the world, we could have in-cluded all those items. But at some point, we have to make some decisions about the direction of our military budget, and we can’t allow ourselves to be convinced that somehow we can sus-tain this level of spending. We can’t. Frankly, even with this 1 percent cut, the level of spending is unsustainable and plunges us further into debt; but I think, hopefully, that is the least that Democrats and Repub-licans in Congress can come together around as a simple first step. My amendment is a very small first step. We don’t have to choose between protecting the homeland and fiscal re-straint. When Congress is imposing spending that the military itself doesn’t even want, here is a vehicle to hand the military the ability to rein in some of that unnecessary spending that reduces our national security rather than improves it. I encourage my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on my amendment and take this modest step towards fiscal responsi-bility. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment. The CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. TURNER ), chair of the Sub-committee on Tactical Air and Land Forces. Mr. TURNER. Mr. Chairman, this amendment is not about fiscal secu-rity. It is arbitrary. It is arbitrary cuts without any reference whatsoever to our security risks, without any assess-ments to the needs of our military, and it is incorrectly stated that we are giv-ing things to our military that they do not want. In fact, they needed more. There is a whole category called un-funded requirements that they put be-fore the House Armed Services Com-mittee. And I want to say that again: unfunded requirements. It is not un-funded wishes, unfunded needs—un-funded requirements. And they are based on the mission that we have as-signed the military and their inability to do so as a result of that gap, and many of which we were unable to fund in this bill. What would some of those relate to? We could take a tour around the world and we know the risks that we are fac-ing: China, Russia, North Korea, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, ISIS, ter-rorism. These are not issues that you take up lightly and then say we can un-dertake an arbitrary cut. By the way, if this was really about fiscal security, it would be a 1 percent cut across all spending, but it is only

going to apply to the military. This doesn’t apply to the IRS. It doesn’t apply to the EPA. This is only saying that the military should be cut as a re-sult of some concept of fiscal savings. But the savings that we have taken have damaged our military already. The Air Force Vice Chief of Staff, Gen-eral Stephen Wilson, at HASC, testified in February of this year, ‘‘ . . . we have become one of the smallest, oldest equipped, and least ready forces across the full spectrum of operations in our service history,’’ the entire history of the Air Force. In 1991, we went to Desert Storm. Our Air Force was 500,000 people and 134 fighter squadrons. Today we find our-selves at 317 in our active force, with 55 fighter squadrons. The Navy is the same. It is the small-est since World War II. Deployments continue to increase, and training and maintenance periods have been short-ened, eliminated, or deferred. The number of Marine Corps infantry battalions have been reduced by four since 2010, going from 28 to 24. Admiral William Moran, the Vice Chief of Naval Operations, has also in-dicated that of the Navy aircraft, 60 percent are unable to operate. The CHAIR. The time of the gen-tleman has expired. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman. Mr. TURNER. At the end of this amendment, it incorrectly states that there should be no cuts to military per-sonnel, and it incorrectly states that because the rest of the cuts actually apply to our military personnel. It ap-plies to what we ask them to do and what we give them to do the job. Our military should be honored. It should not be faced with additional cuts. We should honor what is in this bill. We should satisfy their require-ments, and we should support our men and women in uniform. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chair, the gentleman asked why aren’t there cuts for other agencies. That is not the bill we have before us. We have the National De-fense Authorization bill before us. I have supported similar cuts in various agencies when we have had those ap-propriations bills on the floor. This is the biggest bill on the author-ization side, and then, of course, the companion appropriations bill. This is over 40 percent of our discretionary ex-penditures, and the authorization for 40 percent of our discretionary expendi-tures is in this bill. So a 1 percent cut is very meaningful in this bill. That doesn’t mean that 1 percent cuts in other areas aren’t meaningful, too. They are. There is no single other area that is as important, fiscally, as this area, and I think it would set a positive tone for reining in out-of-control spending. There are many accounts that are funded at levels above President Trump’s request. So if the gentleman is saying somehow that this cut would leave anybody unprepared, he is basi-cally saying that President Trump’s budget would leave the military unpre-pared or leave people poorly equipped. The truth is there are many of us who support vastly lower spending lev-els and believe that those are sufficient for national defense. That is not even what this amendment does. It simply reduces spending just over $6.2 billion. It still blasts through the budget cap. Mr. Chair, the ranking member has indicated that he supports this bill, and I deeply respect his expertise in military preparedness. I encourage my colleagues to unanimously adopt my amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. J
ODYB. H ICE). Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to this amendment. As we all know, over the past 8 years, the world certainly has become a more dangerous place, and we face a variety of threats that, quite frankly, we are not keeping pace with, and we simply cannot continue a pattern of under-funding our military. Yes, we must keep our financial house in order, but we absolutely can-not afford to allow the quality of our national defense to decline by further defense budget cuts. Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Chairman, I oppose this amend-ment. I am concerned about a growing notion that we can thank servicemem-bers for their service but then somehow not provide them everything they need to do their job, that we can continue to allow them to have airplanes that don’t fly, ships that can’t sail, not hav-ing the readiness they need to prepare for the missions we send them on. As the gentleman from Ohio said, that hurts people, and, unfortunately, that is what has happened in recent years. Mr. Chairman, defense spending this year is still 18 percent below what it was in 2010. So what has happened is we have cut the defense budget while the threats that we send our military out to keep us safe from have grown. And remember, 2010 was before Russia in-vaded Crimea, before China started building islands in the South China Sea, before ISIS even existed. This budget that is before us does not fix all our problems. It is a start, and I think it is about as much as we can do in a single year. But even if this bill passes, we are not up to 2010 levels; we have not made up the ground that we have lost. I believe that the men and women who serve deserve our best. This bill, I believe, comes close to providing our best to them this year. It should be supported, and this amendment should be rejected. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. POLIS). The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes ap-peared to have it. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chair, I demand a re-corded vote. The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Colorado will be postponed. 
AMENDMENT NO . 5 OFFERED BY MS . JAYAPAL  
The CHAIR. It is now in order to con-sider amendment No. 5 printed in part B of House Report 115–212. Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Chairman, I rise as the designee of the gentleman from Wisconsin, and I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as fol-lows: 
Page 451, after line 6, insert the following: 
SEC. 1073. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING IN-VESTING IN THE HOMELAND TO AD-VANCE NATIONAL SECURITY. 
(a) F INDINGS .—Congress makes the fol-lowing findings: (1) A strong and safe homeland rests on the health and wellbeing of America’s commu-nities. (2) Federal non-defense discretionary spending provides health care for our vet-erans, research to tackle cancer, safe high-ways, airports and waterways, economic se-curity for families in need, and robust law enforcement. (b) S
ENSE OF CONGRESS .—It is the sense of Congress that any increase to the combined amount authorized to be appropriated for National Defense Budget (Function 50) and Overseas Contingency Operations should be matched—dollar for dollar—with increases in the annual amounts authorized to be appro-priated for the Federal non-defense discre-tionary budget, which makes investments that are essential to the national security of the United States. 
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Reso-lution 431, the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. J
AYAPAL ) and a Mem-ber opposed each will control 5 min-utes. The Chair recognizes the gentle-woman from Washington. Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Chairman, the re-ality is that our economic security is part and parcel of our national secu-rity, and so it is in line with these val-ues today that we introduce Amend-ment 334 to the National Defense Au-thorization Act, which states a sense of Congress that any appropriated in-crease to the combined national de-fense budget and the overseas contin-gency operations budget are matched dollar for dollar by nondefense discre-tionary spending increases. For years now, these spending in-creases have occurred concurrently and equally, keeping important parity be-tween defense and nondefense discre-tionary spending. Because genuine na-tional security depends on the health, vibrancy, and safety of our commu-nities, we must ensure that the spend-ing parity continues and that this Democratic Party principle carries on into fiscal year 2018.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H5725 July 12, 2017 
Nondefense discretionary spending includes a host of funds that are cru-cial to the American people, from edu-cation to research, to veterans’ healthcare, to transportation and even homeland security. NDD funding is ab-solutely essential to moving our coun-try forward. Mr. Chairman, as vice ranking mem-ber of the Budget Committee, I echo the comments made earlier by our ranking member, Mr. S
MITH, about the dysfunction that we have, as we have yet to consider a fiscal year 2018 budget resolution, and we have only 23 legisla-tive days before the new fiscal year be-gins. The effort to push through $696 bil-lion in defense spending will trigger se-questration under the Budget Control Act, and our communities will pay the price in cuts to vital programs. This is senseless brinksmanship, and we must reject it. Sequestration would, further, hinder job creation and stall economic growth by cutting $2 trillion in discretionary spending for infrastructure that makes our communities thrive: roads, bridges, transit, railroad systems, broadband, ports, airports, waterways, schools, and safe, clean water systems. It will erode our investments in education, worker training, public health, and community development that strengthen the mid-dle class and working families; and these shortfalls, Mr. Chairman, will hurt the American people and our economy and make us less secure as a nation. Budgetary gimmicks don’t make our Nation safer either, and that is why in the People’s Budget, which we intro-duced in the Progressive Caucus, the overseas contingency operations budg-et is actually zeroed out, as it is essen-tially a zero accountability slush fund used to avoid the restrictions imposed by the Budget Control Act. Some have pointed out that $10 bil-lion of the $631.5 billion for the mili-tary base budget needs is actually la-beled OCO purely as a technicality to evade the Budget Control Act caps. This is in addition to the clearly marked $65 billion of OCO funds. By including OCO funding one-to-one match in our amendment, we are send-ing a message that we will not accept these efforts to undermine the best in-terests of our country and its people. Increasing opaque funding sources comes at the expense of our Nation’s infrastructure programs, education, and all the other things that I men-tioned earlier. So to the extent that Congress provides relief from the post- sequestration funding levels for our military, responsible Members of this body should be united in insisting that the same relief would apply to domes-tic discretionary spending. This amendment underscores the reality that economic security is national se-curity. For these reasons, and to support the continuation of this important prin-ciple, we urge support of this amend-ment. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. THORNBERRY. I yield myself 2 minutes. Mr. Chairman, in some ways, I think this may be one of the most important debates we have in the next 3 days be-cause the question is whether our sup-port for the men and women who serve in the military is conditional or not. Will we only repair the planes they fly, will we only fix the ships they sail if, and only if, exactly an equal amount will be added to domestic spending pro-grams. b2100 Will we only provide for military spouses for their needs? Will we only take care of wounded warriors for their increased needs if, and only if, an exact amount, the exact dollar for dollar, is added to domestic programs? That holds the military hostage to a domestic political agenda, and I think that is fundamentally wrong at every level. These men and women go out and risk their lives to keep us safe, yet they not only have to worry about North Korea up on the DMZ, they not only have to worry about ISIS in Syria, they have to worry about wheth-er we will pass some domestic program if we are going to adequately provide for them. The Constitution says it is Congress’ responsibility to provide for the mili-tary without condition. This sort of ap-proach, saying, ‘‘We will only do this for the military if, and only if, we get what we want on domestic programs’’ breaks faith with the men and women who serve. It is wrong at every level. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining? The CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Washington has 1
1⁄2minutes remaining. Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the distinguished gen-tleman from Washington (Mr. S
MITH). Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, there is nothing political about a domestic agenda, and this isn’t conditional on additional money being spent. In fact, the chairman has got it exactly flip-flop. The money that we are providing for the armed services at this point, the extra money, is conditioned on cutting it from everything else. As we saw in President Trump’s budget, $54 billion- plus up for defense and $54 billion taken away from the domestic agenda. And it is beyond insulting to say that if you support any sort of domestic spending, you don’t care about the troops. That being concerned about transportation and infrastructure, which, by the way, bridges have col-lapsed and killed people in this country because of the problems with our trans-portation and infrastructure. The Department of Homeland Secu-rity is part of nondefense discretionary spending. Does it not protect us? We have heard from the President it does. The State Department is also part of nondefense discretionary spending, where we have heard from the Sec-retary of Defense that it saves lives. So for our committee—the Armed Services Committee to say, ‘‘We are all that matters, to hell with everything else; and if you care at all about trans-portation or domestic agenda, you don’t care about the troops,’’ that is what is an incredibly disingenuous ar-gument. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute. Mr. Chairman, I think all of us care about domestic spending programs. I certainly do. And I am not for the cuts that were proposed by the administra-tion. That is what we are here to do and decide. What I am opposed to is the sense of Congress that every dollar we increase in defense has to be matched by an in-creased dollar on the domestic side. That makes it conditional. That makes it tied to a domestic political agenda on the EPA, the IRS, education, trans-portation, whatever it is. My point is that all of those things need to stand on their own merits. De-fense needs to stand on its own merits, support for our military needs to stand on its own merits, having planes that fly and ships that sail and adequate funding for our troops and their fami-lies stand on their own merits. It cannot be conditional upon wheth-er or not this Congress or this Presi-dent agrees on other spending items. They need to stand on their own two feet, too. But it is absolutely wrong to say we will only support these military folks if we get what we want on the do-mestic side. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Chairman, I have to say that this is conditional because we still don’t have a budget resolution. So in the absence of a budget resolu-tion, the reality is we are looking at a budget that could potentially raise $676 billion for defense, but at the expense of all of the other programs that we have mentioned. And the reality is that families in the armed services also care about edu-cation, about healthcare, about roads, and about everything else that is fund-ed in domestic spending. So we have to make sure that these two things are interconnected. And, yes, we have got to make sure that the State Depart-ment is funded and that we continue to push for a budget that keeps parity be-tween defense and nondefense discre-tionary. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-ance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. D
ESJARLAIS ), a valuable member of our committee.

Mr. D ESJARLAIS. Mr. Chairman, no one can deny we have a readiness issue within our military due to funding shortfalls. This comes at a time when we are facing unprecedented threats all over the globe. Our Constitution makes it clear that our top priority and duty is to provide for the common defense. In World War II, Americans willingly rationed whatever was necessary to support the war effort and our troops. It would have been unthinkable—un-imaginable—for someone to suggest that our military could not have the resources necessary to defeat our en-emies, unless we had equal spending for everything else. Simply put, we would have lost the war and our freedom. We cannot lose sight or take for granted our Nation’s safety and secu-rity. Without it, the rest of the discre-tionary budget really doesn’t matter so much. I fear America has lost its way if we live in a culture that would suggest that we can’t support our most vital obligation without equal financial rep-resentation of our other government expenditures. I urge my colleagues to give our full support to the men and women in uni-form, support the underlying bill, but oppose this amendment that adds un-necessarily to our debt and further threatens our ability to keep our Na-tion safe for the remaining threats we face. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentle-woman from Washington (Ms. J
AYAPAL ). The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes ap-peared to have it. Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Chairman, I de-mand a recorded vote. The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentle-woman from Washington will be post-poned. 
AMENDMENT NO . 6 OFFERED BY MR . NADLER  
The CHAIR. It is now in order to con-sider amendment No. 6 printed in part B of House Report 115–212. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as fol-lows: 
In division A, strike section 1022 (relating to prohibition on use of funds for transfer or release of individuals detained at United States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba to the United States). 
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Reso-lution 431, the gentleman from New York (Mr. N
ADLER ) and a Member op-posed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, my amendment will strike section 1022 of the bill that pro-hibits the transfer or release of pris-oners from Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to the United States. We are currently imprisoning 41 peo-ple at Guantanamo, 26 of whom are being detained indefinitely without charge or trial, with no proceedings, no hearings, and no opportunity to plea their case, essentially forever. Beyond existing as an affront to fun-damental American values, Guanta-namo is a dangerous counterproductive relic of the past. National security ex-perts and our own military com-manders agree that Guantanamo harms our national security by serving as a recruiting tool for terrorists and damaging our relationships with allies. Furthermore, it is increasingly dif-ficult to justify the annual cost of holding each Guantanamo detainee, which is now climbing to an incredible $10 million a year per detainee. Guan-tanamo is now the most expensive pris-on on Earth, costing U.S. taxpayers ap-proximately $445 million per year. This is especially disappointing when you consider that each prisoner in Federal maximum security penitentiaries costs only $78,000 a year. Not only does our refusal to close Guantanamo diminish our legal and ethical reputation throughout the world, it also costs American citizens astronomical sums of money for no purpose. We have made excellent progress to-wards reducing the numbers of pris-oners, and we should continue to do so. About 35 percent of released prisoners were confirmed or suspected of return-ing to the battlefield during the Bush administration. But the Obama admin-istration developed a robust framework to ensure released detainees were more closely supervised to reduce the likeli-hood of a return to the battlefield. The Bush administration struck dip-lomatic bills to repatriate large batches of prisoners to countries like Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan in bulk, and many recidivists came from those batches. By contrast, the Obama administra-tion developed an individualized review process by six agencies to determine whether to recommend transferring a detainee. Over time, it also developed more careful diplomatic and moni-toring plans with receiving countries to ease a prisoner’s reintegration into that country’s society. When the first detainees arrived at Guantanamo in January 2002, America was still reeling from the 9/11 attacks, and the war in Afghanistan had only just begun. Yet, 15 years later, it is clear that the war on terror has dragged on for too long, as we have ex-panded our involvement in costly clashes in Yemen, Somalia, and Syria. In doing so, we have embroiled our-selves in needless, endless conflict, without an exit strategy or a clear strategy for success. The recent vote for Congresswoman B
ARBARA LEE’s amendment to repeal the 2001 Authorization for Use of Mili-tary Force in the House Appropriations Committee demonstrated that Con-gress is finally realizing a blank check for perpetual war must be reevaluated and reconsidered. Similarly, as we reconsider the 2001 AUMF, I look forward to working to-gether in a bipartisan manner to close the Guantanamo prison, reevaluate our approach to these detainees, and close another dark and sad chapter that has damaged our national honor. Guantanamo’s continued operation provides a momentous challenge to the founding principles of the United States, that no person may be deprived of liberty without due process of law, and certainly may not be deprived of liberty indefinitely without due proc-ess of law, and for each day that its doors remain open, it becomes increas-ingly difficult for our Nation to claim the moral and ethical high ground. We must close the detention facility at Guantanamo now, and this amend-ment will help us achieve that goal. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I re-serve the balance of my time. Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the Nadler amendment. The CHAIR. The gentleman from Ohio is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Chairman, the Nadler amendment would allow detain-ees currently housed at GTMO to be transferred to the United States. As in previous conflicts, it is appropriate and lawful to hold detainees that we engage in our armed conflicts. Guantanamo is the safest and most appropriate location to house these de-tainees. Members can visit there. It is secure and relatively distant from the United States. Moving to the U.S. puts our home-land and citizens at risk. Our enemies have, when able, attacked and, on occa-sion, freed detainees, even committing suicide to do it. I have seen the at-tempts. I have served in Iraq at a de-tention facility. And as far as Guantanamo being a re-cruitment tool, it might just be a re-cruitment tool, and here is why. Be-cause if you are caught trying to kill Americans and committing acts of ter-rorism, you get to go to a Caribbean is-land that provides humane conditions for the detainees. Go visit there and you will see that. They have appro-priate access to healthcare, the same healthcare that our troops get. They have recreational activities, and they have cultural and religious materials. But, more important than anything else, our troops, and the detainees that they hold there, are all safer in Cuba. It is very difficult to sneak up and at-tack Guantanamo Bay. The recent terrorist attacks in Eu-rope should remind us all that there is significant risk, and that we face sig-nificant risk in this world. Yes, we wish the war on terror was over. But guess what. It is not. This would only increase the risk right here in our own backyards. Con-gress has passed, and the President has

I ask for your support in defeating this amendment. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining? The CHAIR. The gentleman from New York has 1
1⁄4minutes remaining. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 15 seconds. I will simply observe that this amendment prohibits the President from transferring prisoners. Do you really think that Donald Trump, the current President, needs the prohibition that he would transfer prisoners to maximum security prisons in the United States if it weren’t safe to do so? Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. B
ACON ), my friend and colleague. Mr. BACON. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong opposition to this amendment. I can attest unequivocally, based on firsthand knowledge, that this latest attempt to transfer detainees at Guan-tanamo Bay is strategically unwise and, I believe, morally wrong. None of the arguments in favor of transferring these prisoners are defensible mili-tarily, legally, or financially. We are in a war and these prisoners were captured on the battlefield. There is no hard evidence to support the ar-gument that Guantanamo is a decisive recruiting tool, and is extremely naive to believe that closing it would some-how magically change the hearts and minds of our enemies. We could disarm and renounce every interest we have and they would just invent another reason to attack us. The truth is that many of these pris-oners are the worst of the worst, yet they are treated better than many of our own veterans. And here is the key point: prisoners released from Guanta-namo have killed Americans in the past and, if given the chance, will glad-ly do so again, a fact openly conceded by officials in the Obama administra-tion itself. We do not want the blood of Ameri-cans killed by these terrorists in cus-tody today on our hands. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, it costs the American taxpayer $10 million a year per detainee to keep a detainee in Guantanamo. To keep that same de-tainee in a Federal maximum security penitentiary in the United States would cost $78,000. That is a ridiculous waste of our military budget. Nobody has ever escaped from a Federal max-imum security prison. b2115 Transferring these prisoners to Fed-eral maximum security prisons in the United States would pose no danger to anybody. And yes, some of these prisoners may be the worst of the worst. Many are not. They were not all caught on the battlefield. Some of them were sold for bounties by people in different tribes or groups in Afghanistan. Some of them were not captured on battlefields at all. Some of them are innocent; some are not. But to keep them in Guantanamo for $10 million each per year with no possi-bility of getting out is an affront to our values. It is an affront to our lib-erties. It is an affront to our military budget and to our pocketbooks, and it is, frankly, plain foolish. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. STEFANIK ), my friend and colleague. Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to Mr. N
ADLER ’s amend-ment, which strikes language that pro-hibits the use of funds to transfer or re-lease Guantanamo Bay detainees to the United States. As we are all aware here today, GTMO holds some of the world’s most dangerous and heinous terrorists, indi-viduals who are responsible for and are ideologically committed to killing Americans at home and abroad. They are responsible for killing our men and women in uniform. Transferring these terrorists to the United States, where constitutional protections and immigration law may apply, puts our national security at risk and hinders our intelligence-gath-ering ability. Today, we remain in a war against al-Qaida and all associated forces. It is the responsibility of Congress to do ev-erything in our power to provide the resources and authorities to win that war, and transferring Guantanamo Bay detainees to the United States under-mines these efforts. Therefore, I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. B
YRNE ), my friend and colleague. Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Chairman, I oppose the gentleman’s amendment. We have debated this issue for years now, and every year we successfully maintain the prohibition on transferring dan-gerous detainees out of GTMO. It is important to remember that most of the 41 remaining prisoners are very dangerous. The language in the underlying bill is required to keep the American people and our allies safe. One of the main goals of Guantanamo Bay is to keep these terrorists from re-turning to the battlefield. Sadly, it has become clear that some of the detain-ees released have returned to the field to fight the United States. We ask our servicemembers to put their lives on the line each and every day in order to keep the American peo-ple safe. How can we ask them to do that, while knowing that we are releas-ing cruel, brutal terrorists back to the battlefield? It would be reprehensible. I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment and protect our service-members and the American people. Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. NADLER ). The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes ap-peared to have it. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I de-mand a recorded vote. The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New York will be postponed. 
AMENDMENT NO . 7 OFFERED BY MR . NADLER  
The CHAIR. It is now in order to con-sider amendment No. 7 printed in part B of House Report 115–212. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as fol-lows: 
In division A, strike section 1023 (prohibi-tion on use of funds to construct or modify facilities in the United States to house de-tainees transferred from United States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba). 
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Reso-lution 431, the gentleman from New York (Mr. N
ADLER ) and a Member op-posed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I will not take 5 minutes. This amendment will strike section 1023 of the bill that prohibits the use of funds to construct or modify facilities in the United States for Guantanamo detainees. The provision is simply designed to further delay the transferred detainees out of Guantanamo and is unnecessary and counterproductive. The arguments for this amendment and against it are essentially the argu-ments for and against the previous amendment that we just went through. That amendment prohibited the use of funds to transfer prisoners. This amendment prohibits the use of funds— this provision, rather, prohibits the use of funds to construct facilities in the United States to receive such trans-ferees. It is essentially the same pros and cons. I just want to mention, though, that yes, some of those detainees may be the worst of the worst, but they will still be detained. But some of them are not. They are people who were caught up in bounty situations where they were sold for money because we were giving a bounty if someone claimed that so and so had been in combat against us, but we didn’t really know. We now know mistakes were made. We may choose to say some of these people can go home, and others can stay in the United States. It is simply, again, a question that we shouldn’t be

spending $10 million a person, instead of $78,000 a person, to hold them in se-cure facilities. The other thing that Ms. S
TEFANIK of New York said I must comment on, she said we are holding people in Guanta-namo because if we transfer them to the United States they will enjoy the constitutional rights of prisoners in the United States, and that we don’t want to do, for whatever reason. She didn’t say. But the fact of the matter is, Guan-tanamo was built for that purpose be-cause it was thought by the Bush ad-ministration initially that people held outside of the Continental United States, in Guantanamo, which is in Cuba, not the United States, would not enjoy constitutional rights, could not use the writ of habeas corpus and other things. However, a series of Supreme Court decisions said that was wrong. The prisoners held in Guantanamo Bay have the same constitutional rights as prisoners held in prisons in the Conti-nental United States, so there is no dif-ference on that whatsoever. You can look up the Supreme Court decisions. They are not secret. And what it comes down to is a prej-udice against holding people here be-cause of a ridiculous fear that people will escape from maximum security prisons, which no one has ever done in the United States, and we can’t hold dangerous terrorists here, and we shouldn’t release terrorists. But nobody is talking about releas-ing terrorists. And you can hold dan-gerous terrorists and dangerous mob-sters, dangerous all kinds of people, in maximum security facilities in the United States. There are really two things we should do: bring them to maximum se-curity facilities in the United States because it saves a lot of money and be-cause it removes a major recruiting tool for our enemies abroad. And, with-in constitutional rights, people should have the opportunity to have a hear-ing. What is most offensive is not that they are at Guantanamo, as opposed to some prison in the United States, what is most offensive is that we are holding some people without any hearing, with-out any due process, essentially for-ever. And yes, we have held people as pris-oners of war during the pendency of a war. But we don’t claim these people are prisoners of war. We don’t give them the rights of prisoners of war. We are just holding them. I am not sure how we are holding them, but we are holding them with no claim of any kind of due process, with no finding that they have, in fact, been terrorists in an individual case; and that is just against all American values. I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Missouri is recognized for 5 minutes. Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to this irre-sponsible amendment that allows the construction of facilities in the U.S. to house detainees, and I urge my col-leagues to vote ‘‘no.’’ We are still at war with terrorism, and the law of war affirms that detainees can properly be held off the battlefield for the duration of the hostilities. Both Republican and Democrats have repeatedly rejected bringing terrorists detained at Guantanamo Bay to the United States. It would be a negligent act to transfer highly dangerous ter-rorists, such as mastermind of 9/11, to U.S. soil to be housed near our neigh-borhoods and near our families. The gentleman said that these, they are not the worst of the worst, that some people are just, you know, caught up perhaps, and they are there. That is not true. I have been there multiple times. At this point, we only have 41 left, and they are the worst of the worst. There is no one left who you might even claim was just caught up and accidentally arrested. That is false. Like I said, I have visited multiple times to see firsthand the threats fac-ing our country, and the detention pro-cedures carried out at that facility. It does not make sense to build a new facility to spend our precious defense dollars here to house terrorists when we already have adequate, very safe fa-cilities at Guantanamo where they are being treated humanely. It is legal and transparent. It is a remote location. It is away from the battlefield and away from our loved ones. So I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no,’’ and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I re-serve the balance of my time. Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Y
OHO). Mr. YOHO. Mr. Chairman, you will hear, and you have already heard, in favor of the Nadler amendment, such as GTMO is contrary to American val-ues; detainees can be held safely at less cost in the U.S. prisons, and GTMO is a recruiting tool for terrorists. Points against the Nadler amend-ment: the number one task of the Fed-eral Government is to provide for the common defense and security of the United States of America and Amer-ican citizens. Americans are safer with detainees in Guantanamo versus the homeland. GTMO is the safest and most appro-priate location to hold detainees. It is appropriate and lawful to hold detain-ees until all al-Qaida and associate forces are defeated. The law for war detainees, including GTMO detainees, states that they can-not be commingled with Federal pris-oners, thus requiring separate facilities costing hundreds of millions of dollars. Evidence of the use of Guantanamo as a recruiting or propaganda tool is conjecture, subjective, and inconclu-sive. Terrorists will continue to attack whether GTMO exists or not. Terror-ists will invent any excuse to attract new recruits. I will not support this. Mr. NADLER. I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. KELLY ), my friend and colleague. Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Mr. Chair-man, I rise in opposition to this amend-ment. Earlier this year, I had the op-portunity to travel with Chairwoman H
ARTZLER to Guantanamo Bay to see firsthand the important work our mili-tary men and women stationed there are doing for our national security. As representatives of the people, we have been given a duty by the Amer-ican people to provide for our common defense, and that includes appro-priately detaining suspected terrorists. According to the March 2017 Director of National Intelligence report, it esti-mated 29 percent of former GTMO de-tainees are confirmed, 17 percent of those, or suspected, 12 percent, of re- engaging in terrorist or insurgent ac-tivities. The ones we hold now are the 41 worst of the worst, including KSM, and we cannot allow them back onto the battlefields. These people do not need to be housed on U.S. soil. GTMO is the most appropriate and safest place to hold these detainees. They live better than I lived both of my tours in Iraq in 2005 and 2009 and 2010. I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I re-serve the balance of my time. Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. W
ILSON ). Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I thank Congresswoman H
ARTZLER for her leadership, and I thank her for this opportunity to speak on this misguided amendment. I have visited Guantanamo Bay twice, and I know firsthand the detain-ees at Guantanamo Bay are the worst of the worst, terrorists who are con-spirators of Osama bin Laden, trained mass murderers, and extremists who have a sole intention of killing Ameri-cans. We have also seen that releasing ter-rorists from Guantanamo puts Amer-ican families at risk. In a report last year, the Director of National Intel-ligence from the prior administration was clear that at least 116 detainees, nearly one-third, released from Guan-tanamo have returned to the battle-field to kill American families. As we have seen from the prolifera-tion of terrorists around the world, from Algeria and North Africa, through the Middle East, across to South Asia and the Philippines, the deterrence of incarceration at Guantanamo Bay has never been more important. I urge all of my colleagues to reject this amend-ment.

Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Chairman, I have no additional speakers, and I re-serve the balance of my time to close. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining? The CHAIR. The gentleman from New York has 1 minute remaining. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, first of all, no one is proposing to release these people, although some probably should be released, but no one is proposing that, so take that red herring off the table. Second of all, I, too, have visited Guantanamo, and I don’t know how you tell by visiting Guantanamo that these prisoners are the worst of the worst, or not, just by looking at them. Thirdly, again, they have the same constitutional rights there as here, so you are not changing anything. And bringing them to maximum security facilities in the United States, while it may cost some money if you had to in-crease the facilities first, instead of spending $445 million, or $10 million a detainee, you would be spending $78,000 a detainee, which would free up your military budget, part of it, for other things. There is simply no rational reason for keeping these people in a military base in Guantanamo which simply serves as a recruiting tool and a meas-uring rod for our enemies abroad. So again, I urge the adoption of this amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. b2130 Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have? The CHAIR. The gentlewoman has 1 minute remaining. Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on this amendment. It is not a wise use of our tax dollars to build new facilities here like the gentleman wants to do to de-tain terrorists when we already have adequate facilities that are doing a great job right now at Guantanamo Bay. We need to keep our terrorists there, away from our families, away from our communities. Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to re-ject this amendment and to vote ‘‘no,’’ and I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. N

AMENDMENT NO . 8 OFFERED BY MR . 
BLUMENAUER  
The CHAIR. It is now in order to con-sider amendment No. 8 printed in part B of House Report 115–212. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as fol-lows: 
Page 505, line 21, strike ‘‘The’’ and insert ‘‘Subject to the limitation in subsection (c), the’’. Page 506, after line 14, insert the following new subsection: (c) LIMITATION .—The program of record in subsection (a) shall not be established, and none of the funds authorized to be appro-priated by this Act or otherwise made avail-able for fiscal year 2018 for this section may be obligated or expended, until— (1) the Secretary of Defense certifies to the congressional defense committees, the Com-mittee on Foreign Relations of the Senate, and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives that— (A) a Nuclear Posture Review has been completed after January 20, 2017; (B) a ground-launched intermediate-range missile is the preferred military system, in terms of cost, capability, and command, con-trol, and communications arrangements, for ensuring that the North Atlantic Treaty Or-ganization’s overall deterrence and defense posture remains credible, flexible, resilient, and adaptable in the face of a deployed Rus-sian ground-launched intermediate-range missile; and (C) a ground-launched intermediate-range missile is the preferred military system for maintaining strategic stability with the Russian Federation at reasonable cost, while hedging against potential technical problems or vulnerabilities; and (2) the Secretary of State certifies to the congressional defense committees, the Com-mittee on Foreign Relations of the Senate, and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives that— (A) the program of record established in subsection (a), and the expenditure of funds to research or develop such a ground- launched intermediate-range missile, is nec-essary to the Secretary of State’s efforts to verifiably return Russia to full compliance with the INF Treaty; (B) at least one NATO Member State gov-ernment, within a range appropriate to pro-vide counterforce capabilities to prevent in-termediate-range ground-launched missile attacks against any NATO Party or to pro-vide countervailing strike capabilities to en-hance the forces of the United States or al-lies of the United States, has completed the necessary legal and constitutional require-ments for an agreement to host a ground- launched intermediate-range missile; and (C) the North Atlantic Council has en-dorsed the deployment of a ground-launched intermediate-range missile. 
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Reso-lution 431, the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. B
LUMENAUER ) and a Member op-posed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oregon. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chair, my amendment deletes language in this bill that would mandate a program of record, green lighting this proposal for road-mobile, ground-launched cruise missiles with ranges that, if tested or deployed, would violate the United States’ obligations under the Inter-mediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. For more than four decades, the United States and Russia have worked through bilateral agreements to reduce their nuclear weapons stockpiles, sav-ing money, and making the world safer. Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush were at the fore-front of this effort with the START 1 and START II treaties. There is a longstanding precedent of carefully negotiating these treaties in a bipartisan fashion because these lead-ers knew that a world with less of these weapons meant a safer world for all of us. Yet over the last several years, our nuclear weapons proliferation has con-tinued on autopilot. Right now we are on track to spend $1.2 trillion on unneeded nuclear weapons. In fact, the Pentagon has concluded that already the United States’ security needs could be met with one-third fewer strategic warheads deployed than New START limits of 1,550. We can and should safely right-size the arsenal as envisioned by Ronald Reagan and the first President Bush. That is why these treaties are so im-portant. They hold us and our adver-saries accountable. We see some confusing signals from the administration, at times appearing to favor nuclear escalation, but at the same time being deeply concerned about managing costs. President Trump has demonstrated a lack of clear understanding of these treaties, but even his administration is fearful that the language undermining the treaty in this bill ‘‘unhelpfully ties them to a specific missile system.’’ Congress should be playing a lead role in getting us back on track with smarter defense spending, not working to abandon this nuclear nonprolifera-tion legacy that Ronald Reagan and Bush, Sr., fought so hard for. We can’t simply fund every weapons program on the list while fulfilling other critical obligations like pro-viding for our military personnel, en-suring we have adequate cybersecurity protections, strengthening our com-mand and control infrastructure, not to mention our non-Defense Depart-ment programs like foreign assistance and diplomacy. We have a poor track record when it comes to carefully managing and budg-eting implementation of our weapons programs. The House continues this poor record now. Why would we establish a pro-gram of record for something that our military, our diplomats, and our NATO allies haven’t asked for? Rather than rushing to adopt this program and abandoning a key inter-national treaty in the process, let’s think this through. Let’s do our home-work to make sure our allies, the De-partments of Defense and State are all on the same page, and develop a coher-ent approach to bring Russia back into compliance, rather than throw money at yet another unnecessary weapons program and undercut that regime. This takes our eye off the ball and could have unintended and, I think in some instances, devastating con-sequences. Mr. Chair, I strongly urge my col-leagues to vote in support of this amendment for smarter defense spend-ing and the protection of a landmark treaty that is part of the legacy of Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH5730 July 12, 2017 
The CHAIR. The gentleman is recog-nized for 5 minutes. Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman, Mr. B
LU-
MENAUER , for his amendment, although I urge its defeat. I start off with pointing out that both the Obama administration and the Trump administration have de-cided the fact that Russia is in viola-tion of the INF Treaty, and neither of those administrations have indicated any belief that Russia will come back into compliance. But having said that, I want to say I am troubled that the gentleman would want to provide a veto on the develop-ment of a system that hasn’t been de-veloped, much less deployed. The gen-tleman is worried about deployment of a system that we still don’t have devel-oped yet. And hopefully it won’t be de-ployed when it is completed. That is really the function of wheth-er Russia comes back into compliance. General Selva, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, testified be-fore the HASC in March: ‘‘They do not intend to return to compliance absent some pressure from the international community and the United States as a cosigner of that same agreement. There is no trajectory in what they are doing that would indicate otherwise.’’ The development of this system that we are talking about here today is that very pressure that General Selva was referencing. This kind of development got the Russians to the table on the INF Treaty anyway, but they are vio-lating the treaty. And that doesn’t just matter to Europe. It matters to Asia, which is completely ignored by the gentleman’s amendment. And Asia matters on INF. Why? Because 95 per-cent of China’s missiles are in INF range. The commander of PACOM has testi-fied that he has requirements for inter-mediate-range missile capability in Asia, ‘‘the aspects of the INF Treaty that limit our ability to counter Chi-nese and other countries’ land-based missiles, I think is problematic. ‘‘ We didn’t conjure the idea of a ground-launched cruise missile out of thin air. The U.S. Army reported that introducing intermediate-range ground-launched missiles into the land domain provides military value across the range of the joint military oper-ations and provides a land-based counter to our adversaries’ anti-access area denial capabilities. This report was required by the HASC last year as a part of our multiyear oversight on how to respond to Russia’s violations of the INF Trea-ty, which the prior administration did nothing to challenge. I appreciate the gentleman’s interest. I will gladly work with him on ways to counter Russia’s violations of the trea-ty, but I must urge defeat of this well- intentioned but poorly conceived amendment. Mr. Chair, I urge support of the bi-partisan approach taken by the House Armed Services Committee in sections 1244 and 1245, and I urge a vote ‘‘no’’ on the Blumenauer amendment. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chair, may I inquire as to the amount of time I have remaining? The CHAIR. The gentleman from Or-egon has 1 minute remaining. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chair, the question is how to get Russia into com-pliance. Walking away from our obliga-tions? I think not. The amendment allows going ahead if the Department of Defense certifies to Congress that it has completed a new nuclear posture review to make sure this program fits in the overall strat-egy; that it certifies that it prefers this program to ensure that NATO’s overall deterrence and defense posture remains credible; that the Department of De-fense certified it prefers this missile for maintaining strategic stability; that State certifies the program of record is necessary to help verifiably return Russia to compliance; that at least one NATO member state has proven it is serious about hosting the missile; and State certifies that the full Atlantic Council has endorsed de-ployment of this missile. Those are the conditions in the amendment, and I would think they are reasonable conditions that the gen-tleman should not object to. If he truly believes in the merit of his argument, there is no reason that that cannot be complied with. And if not, it should not proceed. The CHAIR. The time of the gen-tleman has expired. Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chair, again, I want to remind the gentleman that nobody has indicated that Russia has any intention—they see no signs that Russia has any intention of com-ing back into compliance. I think this is poorly thought out. We need to go forward and not be giving vetoes to other people about what weapon systems we can start devel-oping. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. B
LUMENAUER ). The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes ap-peared to have it. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chair, I de-mand a recorded vote. The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Oregon will be postponed.

SOUTH CAROLINA  
The CHAIR. It is now in order to con-sider amendment No. 9 printed in part B of House Report 115–212. Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as fol-lows: At the end of subtitle G of title XII, add the following new section: 
SEC._12l. RESTRICTION ON FUNDING FOR THE PREPARATORY COMMISSION FOR THE COMPREHENSIVE NUCLEAR- TEST-BAN TREATY ORGANIZATION. 
(a) S TATEMENT OF POLICY .—Congress de-clares that United Nations Security Council Resolution 2310 (September 23, 2016) does not obligate the United States nor does it impose an obligation on the United States to refrain from actions that would run counter to the object and purpose of the Comprehensive Nu-clear-Test-Ban Treaty.

The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Reso-lution 431, the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. W
ILSON ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from South Carolina. Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I thank the Chair for the opportunity to speak on the amendment to restrict the funding from the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization while still providing funds for the international monitoring system. The purpose is simple. Congress never ratified the Comprehensive Nu-clear-Test-Ban Treaty. It is irrespon-sible to the taxpayer and contradictory for the United States to financially support an organization that the United States has never officially joined or contributed funds for a treaty that was never enacted. The amendment clearly continues to fund the international monitoring sys-tem to improve our global and nuclear detection capability, and returns us to the longstanding responsible policies from President George W. Bush’s ad-ministration. This amendment makes it clear that protecting American families is the job of Congress, not an unaccountable international body. As we see a rise in threats around the world, our nuclear deterrence capability is crucial to pro-mote our ability to preserve peace. It is also important that the United States does not require adherence to this trea-ty in order to continue our self-im-posed moratorium on testing nuclear weapons of any size or of any kind. However, as we live in a world of in-creasing threats, we should not bind the United States to an agreement that other nuclear powers like China and Russia do not adhere to. The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test- Ban Treaty has never been enacted so there is no change in policy or outcome by supporting this amendment, just a saving of taxpayers’ dollars.

Mr. Chair, I urge passage of this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment. The CHAIR. The gentleman from Illi-nois is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. As the only physicist in the U.S. Con-gress, I feel a special responsibility to speak out on the importance of strengthening our global nuclear secu-rity architecture. At a time when it is more important than ever for the secu-rity of the United States to reinforce international norms against nuclear testing, we are here debating an amendment that would restrict the ability of a key international institu-tion to monitor nuclear weapons, and, in fact, is designed to undercut pros-pects for either eventual ratification or even continued adherence to the Com-prehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test- Ban Treaty Organization Preparatory Commission is tasked with establishing a verification regime to monitor com-pliance with the comprehensive ban on nuclear explosive testing. If enacted, this amendment would send the wrong signal to the world, de-liberately risking an opening for the resumption of unrestricted nuclear testing by many nations on Earth, which would be a national security dis-aster for the United States. b2145 During the debate on the Iran nu-clear agreement, I received more than a dozen classified briefings, many of them individual classified briefings by our weapons experts who supported the negotiating team. At that time, I spent a lot of time putting myself in the place of a terrorist or proliferating na-tion, and I came to understand the overwhelming technical advantage that the United States possesses today over both other nuclear states, and any potential proliferation state, because we conducted more than 1,000 nuclear tests from 1945 to 1992, more than all other countries on Earth combined. Many of those tests were extensively instrumented and have provided us with the ability to accurately com-puter model and evaluate the perform-ance of nuclear weapons without the risk to safety and to the environment. This is why no official of the Depart-ment of Energy, Department of De-fense, or any other of our nuclear lab-oratories have ever called for a re-sumption of nuclear testing or an unsigning or deprecation of the CTBT, because the moment that other nations begin or resume testing, we lose that crucial advantage. It seems very odd to me that my Re-publican colleagues would want other nuclear or nonnuclear states to obtain intellectual property and parity in this matter. Although under this amend-ment the direct funding for the inter-national monitoring system would nominally remain unscathed, it is dif-ficult to imagine that a significant re-duction in U.S. technical and financial support to the CTBTO would not ad-versely affect the organization’s abil-ity to maintain and operate any nu-clear monitoring system. The proposed amendment also seeks to undermine the United States’ obli-gation as a signatory not to conduct nuclear test explosions. If the United States unilaterally declares itself ex-empt, then other countries are very likely to do the same. In addition, con-trary to what the amendment implies, U.N. Security Council Resolution 2310, does not impose any new obligations on the United States. Nothing is manda-tory in the U.N. resolution. But repudi-ating support for the resolution could trigger bad faith in other nations around the world and reduce U.S. legit-imacy and leverage that ensures other countries do not test nuclear weapons. So we should not signal any inten-tion that the United States encourages a return to a more hostile nuclear envi-ronment, an environment in which the United States does not condemn nu-clear weapons testing but, rather, gives away our position as a country that seeks peace and prosperity for our fu-ture. We have an opportunity to turn po-litical rhetoric into concrete action to curb the global proliferation of nuclear weapons and secure the safety of future generations. From a national security point of view, we must acknowledge that the CTBT locks in an enormous competitive advantage for the United States, one that would be a huge mis-take to begin throwing away. Although the CTBT failed to be rati-fied by a handful of votes the first time it came up in 1999, as George Shultz, the Secretary of State under President Reagan said: ‘‘You can say that a Sen-ator might have been right to vote against the CTBT when it was first put forward’’—in 1999—‘‘and right to vote for it now. Why? Because things have changed.’’ And what he meant by that is that stockpiled stewardship works, and that the detection system, both that is maintained by the United States and by the world communities by the CTBTO works as well. Short of ratifi-cation, the U.S. support for the CTBTO Preparatory Commission remains es-sential. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the Wilson amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-tleman from Alabama (Mr. R
OGERS ). Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for offering this important amendment. This is a simple and straightforward amendment that would help us set pri-orities in spending taxpayer dollars in a small but meaningful way. The U.S. signed the Comprehensive Nuclear- Test-Ban Treaty, back in 1996, but the Senate voted against that ratification in 1999. We are talking about two decades ago. In the meantime, the U.S. has abided by a unilateral pledge to refrain from nuclear explosive tests of any size or kind, but other nations, including Russia and China, have not. They con-tinue to conduct very low-yield nuclear tests that the U.S. does not. Why? Two reasons: one, the CTBT has not entered into force, and the CTBT doesn’t even define what it bans. So while we keep a very stringent policy against testing, other nuclear powers do not. Twenty years later, it is time to ask ourselves why we continue to fund the organization for a treaty that is not going anywhere. This amendment wisely funds the Inter-national Monitoring System which pro-vides us some benefits but prohibits the approximately $2 million in pay-ments to the CTBT organization itself that is included in the FY18 budget re-quest for the State Department. Let’s set this small commonsense priority and let’s reinforce the Obama administration’s own position that the U.N. resolution from last year is not le-gally binding on the United States. Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this amendment. Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Chairman, to me, this is, again, clearly an amendment which is in coordination with the Senate initiative by Senator TOMCOTTON of Arkansas that clearly continues the funding of the Inter-national Monitoring System to im-prove our global nuclear detection ca-pability and returns us to the long-standing policies from President George W. Bush’s administration. The amendment is clear. Protecting American families is the job of Con-gress, not an unaccountable, inter-national body. As we see a rise—as I have stated in the past—in threats around the world, our nuclear deter-rence capability is crucial to promote our ability to preserve peace. Mr. Chair, I urge the approval of the amendment, and I yield back the bal-ance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. W
ILSON ). The amendment was agreed to.

for Fiscal Year 2015 (Public Law 113–291; 128 Stat. 3650), is further amended by striking ‘‘10-year period’’ and inserting ‘‘30-year pe-riod’’. 
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Reso-lution 431, the gentleman from Cali-fornia (Mr. A
GUILAR ) and a Member op-posed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. Mr. AGUILAR. Mr. Chair, for dec-ades, our Nation’s nuclear weapons and triad have provided us with strategic deterrence against nuclear war and the existential threat it represents. And as is often said, it is essential that these weapons and delivery systems be safe, secure, and reliable. However, the age of our forces is a major concern. Currently, our nuclear- capable bomber fleet contains 76 B–52s with the first models entering service over 50 years ago and continuing to fly only after numerous modernization ef-forts. Our Ohio class submarines’ lifespan, which were originally 30 years, have been extended to 42 years with the end of the 42-year lifespan approaching in 2027. The first Minuteman III ICBMs were deployed 40 years ago. With the provocative actions of North Korea and the increase in nu-clear weapon activities taking place around the world, a credible nuclear deterrent is vital to national security of the United States. But, over the past few years, there has been a good amount of debate as to how much this modernization process will cost. Over the next 30 years, not only will all three legs of our nuclear triad, our bombers, ICBMs, and missile sub-marines have to be replaced, a sustainment and modernization pro-gram for our nuclear bombs and war-heads will be taking place at the same time as well. The Congressional Budget Office cur-rently produces a projected cost of nu-clear weapons report annually. How-ever, it only covers 10 fiscal years into the future. My concern is that the CBO’s current 10-year timeframe does not encompass the later out-year costs, including the late 2020s, and early 2030s, when costs are projected by many to increase significantly. My amendment would modify section 1643 of the fiscal year 2015 NDAA, the CBO review of cost estimates of nu-clear weapons and nuclear weapon de-livery systems, to make the timeframe 30 years instead of 10 years, Mr. Chair-man. I brought this issue up last year when I served on the House Armed Services Committee, and earlier this year Rank-ing Member S
MITH and Ranking Mem-ber V
ISCLOSKY wrote a letter to the CBO expressing their interest in an as-sessment of the sustainment and mod-ernization costs associated with the triad for the next 30 years. The New York Times reports that the CBO 30- year estimate, which is due to be re-leased later this year, will put costs at more than $1.2 trillion. With a resurgent Russia, a rising China, and destabilized Middle East, there is little evidence that the de-mands of our conventional forces will decrease. That is why it is imperative that we have proper accounting for our 30-year nuclear modernization process if we are to adequately plan for future conventional and nuclear investments and provide proper oversight. Now, some of my colleagues will say that a 30-year cost estimate isn’t worth the paper that it is written on; that they would depict a time period far too much into the future to obtain a real-istic estimate. But that isn’t the case. Why do we have an FY17 Annual Long- range Plan for the Construction of Naval Vessels, which not only contains an estimated 30-year funding require-ment spanning the 30-year timeframe, but also this was produced by DOD for a cost of $395,000 to produce. We have a 30-year cost estimate for the Navy, but not for our strategic deterrence. I will close by mentioning, one of our nuclear gravity bombs is an example of why we need a permanent 30-year esti-mate. According to GAO, one cost esti-mate produced by NNSA’s Office of Cost Estimating points out that it could cost $2.6 billion more than pre-vious estimates to complete the B61–12 Life Extension Program. But the origi-nal baseline was from NNSA’s fiscal year 2017 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan. If Congress hopes to provide proper oversight of these modernization ef-forts, we must have up-to-date esti-mates that accurately reflect any up-dates and changes that impact our nu-clear bombs, warheads, and delivery systems. That is why I wish to make the time period for CBO’s estimate 30 years instead of 10 years. These are important investments to make in our national security and a re-sponsible way to better understand the cost. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition. The CHAIR. The gentleman is recog-nized for 5 minutes. Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chair, my friend from California is correct about one thing: I will say a 30-year cost estimate is not worth the paper it is written on. I oppose this amendment, just as I opposed a similar amendment by my friend from California, number 12. I submitted amendment No. 88 that we will consider shortly. My amendment was a hopeful compromise with my col-leagues from California, who are offer-ing amendment Nos. 10 and 12 on this same issue. Unfortunately, we have not been able to reach a compromise, so we will put them all before our colleagues here on the floor for consideration. The bottom line is that my col-leagues are asking DOD and CBO to create a 25- and 30-year cost estimate for how much our nuclear forces cost. That would triple the current require-ment of 10-year cost estimates. Unfor-tunately, these type of multidecade cost estimates won’t be worth the paper they are written on. As evidence for that, Assistant Sec-retary of Defense Tom Hopkins, who would be responsible for creating the DOD report, has called a 25-year report on this ‘‘burdensome.’’ He explained it to us this way during a hearing: ‘‘Right now we submit a 10-year report that does have programs and cost on it. . . . As you would expect, looking out that far, 25 years, the credibility of the numbers would be very, very suspect. ...  ‘‘Forecasting DOD costs over a 25- year period with any useful accuracy is extremely difficult given the chal-lenges of predicting developments in the international security environment and ongoing technological advance-ments.’’ The Armed Services Committee and this House have considered these types of 30-year cost estimate amendments for DOD or CBO in the NDAAs for the last 5 years. Each time, for 5 years in a row, these amendments have been defeated. That is because these types of amendments would not result in good, effective oversight and transparency. It would result in false and unreliable data entering the public debate. If any of my colleagues are interested in a reasonable, commonsense way to try and shed a little more light on these very long-term plans and costs, I en-courage them to vote for my amend-ment No. 88. My amendment allows the Secretary of Defense to provide for in-formation beyond 10 years if he thinks it is accurate and would be useful in understanding the nuclear moderniza-tion programs. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on this current amendment and ‘‘yes’’ on my amendment No. 88, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. AGUILAR. Mr. Chairman, if any-thing, my former chairman, when I was on Armed Services, is consistent. He is right. He has continued to oppose this amendment in the past. But what I ask is: Why not have a 30- year estimate? We have one for the Navy. We have one for other programs. If these reports truly aren’t worth the paper that they are written on, then why commission this report? It is al-most $400,000 in taxpayer costs. b2200 The taxpayers deserve, and we de-serve, to provide oversight over these costs. If Congress hopes to provide the oversight for modernizing these efforts, we need these up-to-date reports that accurately reflect these updates and changes to bombs, warheads, and deliv-ery systems. I hope that the chairman would agree with me there. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chair-man, I would say that the Navy pro-vides 30-year cost estimates because Congress made them, and the Navy

AMENDMENT NO . 12 OFFERED BY MR . GARAMENDI  
The CHAIR. It is now in order to con-sider amendment No. 12 printed in part B of House Report 115–212. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as fol-lows: 
At the end of subtitle E of title XVI, add the following new section: 
SEC. 1673. IMPROVEMENT TO ANNUAL REPORT ON THE PLAN FOR THE NUCLEAR WEAPONS STOCKPILE, NUCLEAR WEAPONS COMPLEX, NUCLEAR WEAPONS DELIVERY SYSTEMS, AND NUCLEAR WEAPONS COMMAND AND CONTROL SYSTEM. 
Subsection (a)(2) of section 1043 of the Na-tional Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 (Public Law 112–81; 125 Stat. 1576), as most recently amended by section 1643 of the Carl Levin and Howard P. ‘‘Buck’’ McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 (Public Law 113–291; 128 Stat. 3650), is further amended— (1) by redesignating subparagraphs (F) and (G) as subparagraphs (G) and (H), respec-tively; (2) by inserting after subparagraph (E) the following new subparagraph (F): ‘‘(F) A detailed description of the plan, as applicable, to sustain, life-extend, mod-ernize, or replace the nuclear weapons and bombs in the nuclear weapons stockpile.’’; and (3) in subparagraph (G), as redesignated by paragraph (1)— (A) by striking ‘‘subparagraphs (A) through (E)’’ and inserting ‘‘subparagraphs (A) through (F)’’; (B) by striking ‘‘10-year’’ and inserting ‘‘25- year’’; (C) by striking ‘‘military construction,’’ and inserting ‘‘construction’’; and (D) by inserting ‘‘and the Department of Energy’’ before the period at the end. 
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Reso-lution 431, the gentleman from Cali-fornia (Mr. G
ARAMENDI ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chairman, every year Congress receives a very im-portant and very helpful report regard-ing our nuclear weapons enterprise. It is sometimes referred to as the 1043 Re-port because it is mandated by section 1043 of the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2012. It requires the Department of De-fense, in cooperation with the Depart-ment of Energy, to submit a detailed 10-year plan and budget estimate for our nuclear weapons enterprise, that is, the bombs, the weapons themselves, the command and control, the national lab infrastructure, the delivery sys-tems, et cetera, et cetera. That report is then reviewed by the Government Accountability Office for completeness and accuracy. Finally, the Congres-sional Budget Office then reviews it and submits an independent report. Terrific, all good, we all agree that it is a good thing. I know that the chair-man of the subcommittee wanted that to happen, and indeed we do have it. This amendment simply deals with the reality that this is not a 10-year program. This is a program that will go on for at least the next 25, probably the next 30 years, with extraordinary costs that actually occur beyond the 10-year time horizon. Therefore, it is impor-tant that the United States, as we get into this long-term effort to recapi-talize our entire nuclear arsenal, that we encounter today and take into ac-count today the most expensive years that will occur beyond the 10-year hori-zon. This amendment that I am proposing simply requires that the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy consider a 25-year time horizon for the 1043 Report. We really do need to know, and, in fact, we have some of that in-formation today. The Department of Energy, that is in the National Nuclear Security Admin-istration, does do a 25-year report, and they apparently think it is accurate enough to present to the committees here. The Department of Defense pro-vides the equipment, the means for de-livering the bombs, that is the sub-marines, the various ballistic and intercontinental ballistic missiles, the ground-based ballistic missiles, the new bombers, and, quite possibly, new long-range strike LRSO. So let’s find out. Let’s consider that. The reason we need to consider it is that it is a pile of money, well over $1 trillion that we will be spending in the next 25 years. This is not just my words but if one were to consider the people who deal with this on a regular basis; for example, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, Mr. Kendall, on April 14, 2015, said that we have a problem with recapitalizing the strategic deterrent. We do have a huge affordability prob-lem with that basket of systems. So it is a problem that we are going to have to face up to. Well, who is we? We is us. We are going to have to figure out how to pay for all this, and we are going to have to make some tough choices. So this is simply a matter of trying to figure out how we can get detailed information. I know that our esteemed chairman for whom I have tremendous regard has a little different view, and when he picks up his amendment, I will speak to that. In the meantime, I would ask every-body to support this wise amendment so that we actually have good informa-tion upon which to make some deci-sions today that will then be paid for in the next 15 to 25 years. That is what this amendment is. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chair-man, I claim the time in opposition to this amendment. The Acting CHAIR (Mr. LAMALFA ). The gentleman is recognized for 5 min-utes. Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chair-man, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I reluctantly oppose this amendment from my friend and colleague from California. He is a very serious, thoughtful, and clearly articu-late Member, but it is for the same rea-sons that I just outlined with Mr. A
GUILAR ’s amendment. I will keep this brief because we just talked about this. But going down this path for a 25- or 30-year cost estimate for nuclear weapons is a bad idea and would result in bad data. The Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense in the Obama administration who is still in the Trump administration doesn’t think it is a good idea either. The HASC and the House have con-sidered this 30-year cost estimate for the last 5 years in a row, and each time it has been rejected. This amendment would not result in good, effective oversight and transparency. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to consider voting for my reasonable, commonsense amendment when we get to it, amendment No. 88. I urge my col-leagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on this amend-ment and ‘‘yes’’ on Rogers 88. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chairman, may I ask how much time I have re-maining. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California has 1
1⁄2minutes re-maining. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chairman, this is a commonsense amendment. I have great esteem for the chairman, but I really don’t think we ought to be mushrooms. I don’t think we ought to be kept in the dark. We really are in the process here of making decisions today to spend a vast amount of money not just in the next 10 years—and we do have estimates of what that would cost—but in the out-years. Those out-years, we know from infor-mation that has been delivered to us, that it will be a bow wave—to use the military term—of extraordinary dol-lars, well into the hundreds of billions of dollars that would be spent in the out-years beyond the 10 years. We need to know today because that will bite into the money that we have available for all of the other things that we must do for our national de-fense. Mr. Chairman, I would ask for an ‘‘aye’’ vote on this commonsense amendment, and I yield back the bal-ance of my time.

So I would urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on this and urge peo-ple to support Rogers amendment No. 88, which will allow the Secretary to go beyond 10 years to 25 or 30 if the Sec-retary believes it would yield valuable data.

AMENDMENT NO . 13 OFFERED BY MR . 
BLUMENAUER  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 13 printed in part B of House Report 115–212. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as fol-lows: 
At the end of subtitle G of title XVI, add the following new section: 
SEC. 16ll. LIMITATION ON USE OF FUNDS FOR LONG-RANGE STANDOFF WEAPON. 
(a) I NGENERAL .—Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in any fiscal year, the Secretary of Defense may not obligate or ex-pend more than $95,600,000 on development of the long-range standoff weapon or any other nuclear-capable air-launched cruise missile, and the Secretary of Energy may not obli-gate or expend more than $220,253,000 on the life extension program for the W80-4 war-head, until the Secretary of Defense, in con-sultation with the heads of other relevant Federal agencies, submits to the appropriate congressional committees a Nuclear Posture Review that includes a detailed and specific assessment of the following: (1) The anticipated capabilities of the long- range standoff weapon to hold targets at risk beyond other already existing and planned nuclear-capable delivery systems. (2) The anticipated ability of the long- range standoff weapon to elude adversary in-tegrated air and missile defenses compared to the B-21 bomber. (3) The anticipated effect of the long-range standoff weapon on strategic stability rel-ative to other nuclear-armed countries. (4) The anticipated effect of the long-range standoff weapon on the offensive nuclear weapons capabilities and programs of other nuclear-armed countries. (5) The anticipated effect of the long-range standoff weapon on the response of other nu-clear-armed countries to proposals to de-crease or halt the growth of their nuclear stockpiles. (6) The anticipated effect of the long-range standoff weapon on the threshold for the use of nuclear weapons. (b) F
ORM.—The Nuclear Posture Review re-quired by subsection (a) shall be submitted in unclassified form but may include a clas-sified annex. (c) APPROPRIATE CONGRESSIONAL COMMIT -
TEES DEFINED .—In this section, the term ‘‘appropriate congressional committees’’ means— (1) the Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate; and (2) the Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 431, the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. B
LUMENAUER ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oregon. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 3 minutes. Mr. Chairman, it is time to insert fis-cal sanity into our nuclear weapons planning. We are set to spend $400 bil-lion over the next decade and $1.2 tril-lion over the next 30 years to recapi-talize our entire nuclear arsenal. This nuclear escalation will build a force far exceeding what the Pentagon and secu-rity experts have said is necessary to deter a nuclear threat. A stronger nuclear program is not going to help us deal with the strategic challenges we face today, like the fight the against Islamic State, but it will result in having to crowd out Army, Navy, and Air Force conventional pri-orities. We need to revisit the strategy. We are here in Congress to make hard deci-sions about how to spend taxpayer dol-lars. The Pentagon should provide long-term cost reports and tell us what certain weapons will actually add to our existing capacity. My amendment deals with one par-ticular outrageous piece of this unsustainable escalation: the long- range standoff weapon, or the LRSO. Now, this weapon is projected to cost $20 billion to $30 billion. This amendment would lock the LRSO funding at fiscal year 2017 levels until the administration submits a Nu-clear Posture Review to Congress that includes a detailed assessment of why we need this weapon. It wouldn’t pre-vent it. It would just keep the funding at the current level until they can tell us why we need it. Until the administration carefully examines the utility of the LRSO, why should we rush its development? After all, the father of this device, former Secretary of Defense Bill Perry, has ar-gued there is scant justification for spending tens of billions of dollars on that weapon. General Mattis has stated numerous times that he is not sold on the LRSO. We shouldn’t risk making tens of bil-lions of dollars in commitments like this with potential failure to follow through all while forfeiting other crit-ical priorities. Before we continue this nuclear escalation on autopilot, let’s make sure. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chair-man, I claim the time in opposition to this amendment. The CHAIR. The gentleman is recog-nized for 5 minutes. Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chair-man, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I strongly oppose this amendment, but it is not just me. The Armed Services Committee considered nearly the same amendment during markup, and it was soundly defeated. It is not just the committee that op-posed this amendment. It is also our country’s senior-most military officers. They repeatedly described the urgent need for the LRSO and the declining reliability of the NACMs. They have testified before our com-mittee in March on this exact issue. Here is the Nation’s second highest ranking military officer, the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Selva: 
ALCMs were designed and built in the 1970s with a 10-year lifespan. We know today they remain relevant, but we can’t continue to maintain them. A decade from now, those weapons will not be able to penetrate Rus-sian air defenses, and therefore there is an urgency for their replacement. 
In the same year, STRATCOM Com-mander General Hyten said: 
The LRSO is the first missile system devel-oped in unison with a nuclear warhead in mind for many decades. Limiting resources or funding of either component will disrupt the entire concept-to-capability timeline. 
Here is President Obama’s Assistant Secretary of Defense, Bob Scher, testi-fying before my committee last year: 
The Obama administration’s decision to field a modern ALCM replacement is essen-tial to maintain the ALCM’s unique con-tribution to stable and effective deterrence. 
Finally, let me briefly address this nonsense argument that LRSO is de-stabilizing. Here is President Obama’s Under Secretary of State for Arms Control Rose Gottemoeller testifying before the Senate last year: 
First, the LRSO is consistent with our arms control commitments and President Obama’s Prague agenda. Second, the LRSO supports strategic stability and does not un-dermine it. Third, it is important in the eyes of our allies. There is no evidence that the LRSO or our nuclear modernization program are prompting an action-reaction cycle or catalyzing these arms races. The LRSO is valuable in maintaining strategic stability. 
Mr. Chairman, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on this amendment, and I reserve the bal-ance of my time. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Washington (Mr. Smith), who is the ranking member. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I just want to make two quick points, first to the point Mr. B
LUMENAUER made about how we are planning on recapitalizing our entire nuclear arsenal. Now, we have had a robust debate about how much that is going to cost over 10, 25, 30 years. I have some sym-pathy for the argument that Mr. R
OG-
ERSmade. It is going to be very dif-ficult to estimate how much it is going to cost over 25 or 30 years.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H5735 July 12, 2017 
But I do know that if we are talking about recapitalizing our entire nuclear arsenal, all of the submarines, all of the ICBMs, a new bomber, it is going to cost a lot. I don’t know if it is $1.2 tril-lion or $2 trillion. Whatever it is, it is going to be enormously expensive. b2215 At a time when we face a multi-plicity of threats from Russia, North Korea, and where missile defense is critical, I do not believe this is the best investment of our money to get caught up in the Cold War, in the battle against Russia and their nuclear weap-ons, and making sure we can counter every possible scenario. It is not an ef-ficient use of money. This amendment is but one piece of it to say let’s take a step back and see if this is the best place to spend the money. Maybe it would be better to spend it on cybersecurity. Maybe it would be better to spend it on missile defense. There are a whole lot of other places I think that are better than trapping ourselves in these nuclear scenarios that require us to build an unbeliev-ably expensive nuclear arsenal. Secondly, I will disagree with Mr. R
OGERS on one point: the more you build nuclear weapons, the more the other side tends to build nuclear weap-ons. I cannot agree that this is not going to potentially lead to an escalation. In fact, the reason we are so hell-bent on building the LRSO and all of these oth-ers is because we are concerned about what Russia and China are doing. That is how it works. It does have that destabilizing effect. I don’t think this is the best place for us to spend our defense dollars. Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chair-man, I was quoting Rose Gottemoeller from the Obama administration, saying that it was not going to perpetuate this cycle. Mr. Chair, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from Wyoming (Ms. C
HENEY ), my friend and an outstanding member of the Armed Services Committee. Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Chairman, it is surprising to sit here and hear argu-ments that we have been hearing really for the last almost 70 years now, the notion that the reason that our adver-saries build nuclear weapons is because we are building nuclear weapons, or the notion that we all are building nuclear weapons for the same purposes. The North Koreans are building nu-clear weapons in order to threaten us. They are building nuclear weapons, po-tentially, in order to hold us hostage. They are building nuclear weapons against which we must deter. The notion that if we advance our ca-pabilities, the notion that if we produce the LRSO we are going to be in a position where we are encouraging the other side is just simply a flawed understanding. We already have a situ-ation where our adversaries are mod-ernizing their dual capable cruise mis-siles. They don’t think these things are destabilizing. We shouldn’t argue that they are for us, as well. In addition, the LRSO plays a hugely important deterrent role. It imposes important and real costs on any poten-tial adversary. It forces them, in addi-tion to modernizing their nuclear arse-nals, to modernize their air defense ar-senals. It is hugely important that we pro-ceed. It is hugely important that we modernize. I agree it is a very expen-sive undertaking, but I would urge my colleagues to defeat this amendment and remember that the single most ex-pensive thing we can do would be to fail to defend ourselves. The single most expensive thing we can do would be to encourage an adversary to attack us because they think they can over-take us or overcome our capabilities. I think it is important that we not go down the path of unilateral disar-mament and that we do everything we can to continue to modernize at a very rapid pace, to speed up the pace at which we are modernizing. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chair-man, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chairman, I am stunned to think that this is some-how the equivalent of unilateral disar-mament. The amendment says that the fund-ing level for this new program would remain at the current fiscal year level until the administration submits a nu-clear posture review to Congress that indicates a detailed assessment of why we need the weapon. If what the gentleman says is true— and I get mixed signals from the Sec-retary—then they can easily do that. They are not cut off. It has nothing to do with unilateral disarmament. We have more than enough nuclear weap-ons to destroy these countries many times over. My friend, Mr. S MITH, talks about other priorities, from cybersecurity to what is happening with ISIS. Lavishing funds on programs that have not yet been justified and can’t meet this test is not worthy. You have other things that you want to help the Department of Defense do, which I think we share. Mr. Chairman, I strongly urge ap-proval of this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gen-tleman from Oregon (Mr. B
LU-
MENAUER ). The question was taken; and the Act-ing Chair announced that the noes ap-peared to have it. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR.

MCCLINTOCK  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 14 printed in part B of House Report 115–212. Mr. M
CCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as fol-lows: 
Strike section 2702. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 431, the gentleman from California (Mr. M
CCLINTOCK ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. Mr. M
CCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, our current defense spending is about where it was at the very peak of the Reagan defense buildup after adjusting for inflation. It is about the same as the next eight most powerful military forces on the planet, combined. Six of those eight are already our allies. The President has proposed adding $54 billion to this. That is the equiva-lent of adding more than the entire military establishment of Great Brit-ain to what we already have. Yet we are told, and I do not doubt, that much of our military force is ill equipped and unready for combat. If that is the case, it is not a fiscal prob-lem; it is a management problem. We seem to care how much money is being spent, but not how it is being spent. That is a catastrophic failure of con-gressional oversight. In recent years, the Pentagon has warned that its infrastructure is 22 per-cent bigger than necessary. It has asked Congress for another round of Base Realignment and Closure reviews. Just last month, Secretary Mattis urged resumption of BRAC. He believes it will save $2 billion a year and $20 bil-lion over 10 years. That is enough money to buy 120 FA–18 Super Hornets, 300 more AH–64 helicopters, or four Vir-ginia class submarines if only Congress would get out of the way and allow unneeded bases to close or consolidate. The Pentagon has the authority to close or consolidate bases on foreign soil, but in the NDAA Congress blocks its authority to close or consolidate unnecessary bases on our own soil. My amendment removes the NDAA prohibition on this needed process and allows BRAC to move forward as our President has requested. His Statement of Administration Policy on NDAA is crystal clear: ‘‘While the bill contains many promising reforms, it fails to au-thorize a Base Realignment and Clo-sure round, which would result in sub-stantial recurring savings and allow DOD to align infrastructure with force reduction.’’ I have heard three objections: First, we are told the upfront costs of consolidation can be high. But the re-sults are now in, and the first four

BRAC rounds are saving us $7 billion a year. Second, we are told local economies depend on these bases, but experience tells us that communities rapidly re-cover by freeing these assets for pro-ductive commercial use. Third, we are told to wait until we finished expanding our forces, but the excess capacity estimate already as-sumes force expansion, and a new round of BRAC will only wring out a small portion of the overcapacity. When we squander billions of defense dollars keeping obsolete military bases open in order to satisfy congressional constituencies, we directly rob our military forces of the resources that we are constantly reminded that they des-perately need. There is an old saying that you can’t fill a broken bucket by pouring more water in it. At some point, you have got to fix the bucket. That is our re-sponsibility. We need to take it more seriously. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate very much the efforts by Mr. M
CCLINTOCK , but simply put, now is not the time to consider a Base Realignment and Clo-sure. In the past, BRAC has been used without conducting a thorough study, has incurred significant costs and jeop-ardized valuable military communities, such as those of the Midlands of South Carolina surrounding Fort Jackson or the Aiken-Barnwell community that I represent adjacent to Fort Gordon, Georgia. If facilities are shuttered, the exist-ing secure assets will not be reasonably replicated. In testimony before the House Armed Services Committee just last month, Secretary Jim Mattis stat-ed that he also has reservations about the BRAC assessments. It is also important to be clear: BRAC is not a proven cost-saving measure. The last BRAC cost 67 per-cent more than planned to carry out, dramatically reducing any projected savings. It would be undermining to our na-tional security and to communities around the Nation to close down mili-tary installations without a com-prehensive study, especially as the military works to grow the force to ad-dress emerging threats around the globe. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. M
CCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. S
MITH), the ranking member. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I support this amendment. I disagree very strongly with the re-marks of the gentleman from South Carolina. First of all, the past BRACs have saved us an enormous amount of money. There have been five rounds. The first four saved us pretty much ex-actly as much money as they said they were going to. The fifth one was more expensive, but the fifth one was done in 2005, at a time when we were building up the size of the military. It wasn’t so much a closure as it was a realign-ment. But even then, it is now saving us money. So if you want to argue against BRAC, argue against BRAC; but please, let us not argue that it doesn’t save us money because that is just factually ri-diculous. It absolutely saves us money. Second, there have been a number of studies by the Air Force and others. The Air Force has estimated that they are 20 percent over the capacity of their installations. It would be great if we could have a comprehensive study. I agree with that. What our bill has done every year for the last several years is prohibit them from even thinking about a BRAC. So it is a brilliant argument to say, well, you can’t do a BRAC because you haven’t done a comprehensive study, and then to put in the bill you are pro-hibited from doing a comprehensive study. It is a nice little tautology, but it isn’t helping our military. As we have been discussing through-out the night, we have more needs than we have money for. We cannot afford for parochial interests to get in the way of what is in the best interest of our troops. We need a BRAC. By the way, it doesn’t even authorize a BRAC. It simply removes the prohibi-tion of a BRAC. A BRAC cannot happen unless Congress authorizes it. So all this is going to do if this amendment passes is allow the military to do pre-cisely what the gentleman from South Carolina just said they ought to do. There is no reason to oppose this amendment, and I urge support. Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-tleman from Georgia (Mr. AUSTIN  S
COTT), my friend and colleague. Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I rise today in opposition to this amendment to the fiscal year 2018 Na-tional Defense Authorization Act of-fered by my friend and colleague, Mr. M
CCLINTOCK of California, that would strike a bipartisan provision that clari-fies that the fiscal year 2018 National Defense Authorization Act does not au-thorize a round of Base Realignment and Closures, otherwise known as BRAC. After nearly 13 hours of debate in the Armed Services Committee, my col-leagues and I came together and over-whelmingly approved language in the final mark that prevented a BRAC for the next fiscal year. We passed that vote by a vote of 60–1. Many of my colleagues have argued that past BRACs eliminated excess in-frastructure in the Nation’s military or streamlined defense spending, but it is just not the case, Mr. Chair. Earlier this year, Secretary Mattis testified to the Armed Services Com-mittee on the need to reassess our mili-tary’s current infrastructure resources and needs before closing or realigning any current resources. The fiscal year 2016 National Defense Authorization Act required an updated DOD force structure plan and an infra-structure inventory. To date, DOD has not submitted the required infrastruc-ture report. Quite simply, we may not have enough capacity and infrastructure to meet our current needs and our needs going forward as we look at the threats coming from Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, and the threat of global ter-rorism and transnational criminal or-ganizations. Who knows what threat we will face tomorrow. If the Secretary of Defense, I hope, will work with us to reassess our cur-rent capacity, then the need to halt re-alignments and closures to give him time to do so is all the more impor-tant. With outdated capacity informa-tion, there is simply no reason to close or realign an installation just to repur-chase or rebuild a new one just a few years down the road. It is fiscally irre-sponsible in terms of defense spending and meeting our needs moving forward. b2230 I have nothing but respect for my colleague from California and have fought many fights to get rid of waste and cut government spending with him. This is just one that I can’t sup-port. I hope that my colleagues will join me in voting against Mr. MCCLINTOCK ’s broken bucket amendment. Mr. M
CCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, to vote against these measures, to vote to rob our military of $20 million ofsavings over the next 10 years for military bases the Pentagon itself says are unnecessary, it comes down to that. You cannot provide for the com-mon defense if you cannot pay for it, and the ability of our country to do so is being called into grave question. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Utah (Mr. B
ISHOP ). The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman has 1
1⁄2minutes remaining. Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chair, let me say in 90 seconds then, it may sound counterintuitive that BRAC doesn’t save us money, but even though it can take money off the De-fense rolls, the question is: Where does this property end up and who pays for it? The bulk of the property ends up in the hands of local government, State government, and if it was public do-main to begin with, the Department of

the Interior has got first crack at it. I have also always sarcastically said every time there is a BRAC base clo-sure, I end up with a new national park and national monument. And even though we have never done a study to verify it, I can give you a half dozen off the top of my head where that hap-pened. So the question is: Does the taxpayer save money? And if you invent a BRAC process that will guarantee that the Federal estate will not be enlarged, that you won’t simply transfer prop-erty from one Federal entity to an-other or from the Federal Government to State governments so the taxpayer saves money, then I will gladly support a BRAC process. But until we can guarantee that, all we are doing is shifting the money around, shifting the entity around. We may help the Department of Defense change their budget, but the taxpayer is still on the hook for all the property and all the efforts that go into it, and that is wrong, and that is the process. When we change the BRAC process to make it more public, to make it so the taxpayer saves, then I will support it, but that hasn’t happened yet. Therefore, I ask Members to vote ‘‘no’’ on the amendment. Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR.

At the end of subtitle E of title XVI, add the following new section: 
SEC. 1673. MODIFICATION TO ANNUAL REPORT ON PLAN FOR THE NUCLEAR WEAP-ONS STOCKPILE, NUCLEAR WEAP-ONS COMPLEX, NUCLEAR WEAPONS DELIVERY SYSTEMS, AND NUCLEAR WEAPONS COMMAND AND CONTROL SYSTEM. 
Subsection (a)(2)(F) of section 1043 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fis-cal Year 2012 (Public Law 112–81; 125 Stat. 1576), as most recently amended by section 1643 of the Carl Levin and Howard P. ‘‘Buck’’ McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 (Public Law 113–291; 128 Stat. 3650), is further amended by inserting after the period at the end the following: ‘‘The Secretary may include information and data for a period beyond such 10-year period if the Secretary determines that such infor-mation and data is accurate and useful in understanding the long-term nuclear mod-ernization plan.’’. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 431, the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. R
OGERS ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Alabama. Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chair-man, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chair, as I said a few minutes ago, I submitted this amendment as a hopeful compromise with my colleague from California who offered amend-ment Nos. 10 and 12 on this same issue. I will keep this very brief because we have discussed this thoroughly tonight. But going down a path of a 30-year cost estimate for nuclear weapons is a bad idea and will result in bad data. As we debated this for the past 5 years now, the Obama administration didn’t want to do it, the Trump administra-tion doesn’t want to do it, and the HASC and the House have voted against it every year. I urge my colleagues to consider vot-ing for my reasonable commonsense amendment, commonsense way to get this issue resolved with amendment No. 88. My amendment allows the Secretary of Defense to provide information be-yond 10 years if he thinks it would be accurate and useful in the information it yielded. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on my amendment and ‘‘no’’ on amendment Nos. 10 and 12. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition, though I am not opposed. The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-tion, the gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I just want to say very quickly, I still have the concerns that I have ex-pressed about the broader nuclear weapons issue and will talk a little bit more about that in a minute. But you know, this is a way to at least give an option to get a greater idea of the costs. So it may not be everything that we would want, but it is certainly not something that we should oppose, so I do not oppose it and would urge sup-port. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chair, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gen-tleman from Alabama (Mr. R

OHRABACHER ). Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Chair, I rise in support of a very important part of this en bloc proposal, which is filled with important parts. Dr. Afridi is a Pakistani doctor who risked his life to help our special forces identify the hiding place of Osama bin Laden, the planner and commander of the slaughter of 3,000 Americans on 9/ 11. Dr. Afridi, clearly an American hero, has languished in a Pakistani dungeon for the past 6 years and has been sen-tenced to spend another two decades in captivity. Dr. Afridi is a courageous hero. He is not forgotten. His plight is not ignored. Tonight, I am pleading that this lan-guage be retained in the final version of this en bloc amendment. This man is suffering for us. Making my amendment in order ac-knowledges Dr. Afridi’s sacrifice and demands Pakistani authorities release him immediately. If we turn our backs on such a noble friend as Dr. Afridi, shame on us. And I thank the Members who put this bill together for including this very moral statement. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the dis-tinguished gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. WILSON ). Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Chairman, thank you for the oppor-tunity to speak on amendment No. 66. On July 4, the Communist totali-tarian regime in North Korea marked the holiday testing an intercontinental ballistic missile. This is yet another es-calation by a regime that has tested ballistic missiles and has conducted five nuclear tests. This amendment expresses a clear sense of Congress: we will not tolerate the escalation by the regime in North Korea testing ballistic missiles or de-veloping a nuclear weapon threatening American families. The amendment also reaffirms the strong commitment of the United States to our allies in the region, espe-cially South Korea, Japan, and Aus-tralia. I am encouraged by the leader-ship of President Donald Trump for a commitment of peace through strength. It is clear the regime in North Korea will only respond to strength, and this sense of Congress strongly states our commitment to keeping all options on the table while addressing the threat of North Korea, whether it be military, diplomatic, or economic. Mr. Chairman, I urge support of this amendment with the en bloc package. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the dis-tinguished gentleman from Pennsyl-vania (Mr. F

We must advocate for a foreign policy that projects strength and purpose. The threat profile our Nation faces has never been more severe, including from rogue regimes and those who di-rectly and indirectly support the spread of terror. Acting in isolation, each of these threats requires U.S. at-tention. However, we must also inves-tigate and understand the scope of

evil’s reach, especially the nexus be-tween Iran and North Korea. Mr. Chair, my amendment would compel the Pentagon to report the ex-tent of cooperation on nuclear pro-grams, ballistic missile development, chemical and biological weapons devel-opment, and conventional weapons pro-grams between Pyongyang and Tehran. Only when we understand the complex dealings between these enemies of peace can we outline a plan to combat them. My amendment will provide better, more comprehensive tools for Amer-ican defense, and I urge my friends on both sides of the aisle to support it for the sake of our Nation’s security. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. S
UOZZI ). Mr. SUOZZI. Mr. Chair, I rise in sup-port of a bipartisan amendment I have offered along with my colleagues from Texas, Chairman T
HORNBERRY of the Armed Services Committee and Mr. C
ONAWAY , a fellow CPA. It is essential the Democrats and Re-publicans work together to control government costs to root out waste, fraud, and abuse, and that we specifi-cally focus these efforts on the Depart-ment of Defense. Chairman T
HORNBERRY has promoted a reform agenda of which I am very supportive. During the Armed Services Committee markup of the bill, I pro-posed changes to the chairman’s re-form package. My amendment sought to make the use of private sector audi-tors more efficient and effective by eliminating bureaucratic mandates and an unnecessarily bureaucratic com-mittee. The chairman supported my goals, and I suggested that I work with my fellow CPA, Mr. C
ONAWAY . In a bipar-tisan spirit, we agreed to this amend-ment, which will, one, help eliminate the incurred cost audit backlog; two, help reallocate resources to prioritize higher risk audits with potential sav-ings for government; three, help ensure private sector auditing capacity exists; and, most importantly, four, root out waste, fraud, and abuse in Defense con-tracting. I never thought I would come to Washington to work on Department of Defense audits, but Chairman T
HORN -
BERRY ’s willingness to engage my ex-pertise and the bipartisan manner of the amendment will hopefully result in significant reforms and aid in my ongo-ing efforts to help save taxpayers’ dol-lars by making government more effec-tive and efficient. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the dis-tinguished gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. J
OHNSON ). Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. Chairman, I rise to speak on the Na-tional Defense Authorization Act being considered this evening and on my amendment No. 22 to require an Army cyber training readiness assessment. It is vital that we adequately fund our military with the necessary train-ing and tools they need to succeed. Our men and women in uniform deserve the greatest amount of resources we can possibly provide at all times. If agreed to, my amendment requires the Army to review the combat train-ing centers, or CTCs, and the resident cyber capabilities and training to make certain the needs of prerotational cyber training are fully met. These CTCs’ rotations serve as the premier events to evaluate collective training, and the rotations provide feedback to commanders on how well they have trained their units and their leaders and what they need to do to im-prove readiness. Including cyber training is a com-monsense step to meet the threats our Nation will face. The Army has testi-fied before Congress that this area is falling short and additional resources are desperately needed for cyber train-ing. Our Armed Forces must be able to operate within highly defended envi-ronments, possibly at the leading edge of a joint force, to control the air, sea, space, and cyberspace domain. My amendment will assist us in this en-deavor, and I urge my colleagues to support it. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. CORREA ). b2245 Mr. CORREA. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment in en bloc package 3, amendment 53, that would require the Secretary of Defense, in co-ordination with the Director of Na-tional Intelligence, to provide Congress a report of any cyber attack attempts by the Russian Government and other Russian actors targeting the Depart-ment of Defense within the past 2 years. These Defense Department systems are the foundation of our Nation’s de-fense and security, and it is crucial that they are protected. Despite this understanding, our Nation is still not fully aware of the magnitude of the problems, and Congress is not appro-priately advised of these past breaches. My amendment would require a re-port from the Secretary of the Defense to Congress so that we can begin to properly address the strength of our Nation’s security. I thank Congresswoman S
HEA-POR-
TERfor supporting my amendment, and I urge all of my colleagues to do the same. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I have no further speakers on this en bloc amendment, and I reserve the bal-ance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I yield 90 seconds to the gentleman from California (Mr. C
ORREA ). Mr. CORREA. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment No. 88 of 228, H.R. 2810. This amendment would call upon the Department of Defense to update its cyber strategy, requiring the President to draft guidance for offensive cyber capabilities, and to authorize inter-national cooperation, including build-ing of our NATO partner allies’ cyber-security. World war III is raging in cyberspace now. It has become one of the most crucial homeland and global security issues. Our Presidential election came under cyber attack, possibly compro-mising the American electoral system. But the U.S. is not alone. There were press reports of massive cyber attacks of French President Emmanuel Macron’s campaign as well. My amendment will increase our of-fensive cyber capabilities to prevent our adversaries from engaging in cyber espionage like we witnessed during the past election cycle and recent global cyber attacks. Protecting our network is vital to the security of our Nation and allies, and my amendment works to that end. I thank Congresswoman ROSEN for supporting my amendment as well, and I urge all my colleagues to do the same. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of the en bloc amend-ments, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Washington. I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. L
IPINSKI ). Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Chair, I want to start off by thanking the chair and ranking member for supporting these two amendments, one in this bloc, one in the next bloc. The first amendment will authorize the Hacking for Defense, or H4D, Pro-gram. This is an innovative program developed in Silicon Valley with the help of battlefield-experienced Iraq and Afghanistan veterans, and it finds unique solutions to national security problems. First taught at Stanford, H4D uses lean business startup methods to en-gage America’s best and brightest in solving real security challenges faced by the DOD. Rapid, low-cost technological innova-tion is what makes Silicon Valley revo-lutionary, but the DOD hasn’t histori-cally had the mechanisms in place to harness this American advantage. Hacking for Defense creates ways for talented scientists and engineers to work alongside with veterans, military leaders, and business mentors to inno-vate solutions that make America safer. For example, a July 7 New York Times article details how an H4D grad-uate, Capella Space, is helping track North Korean nuclear capabilities, helping to try to make our world safer. Mr. Chairman, I include in the R
ECORD this article, along with these letters of support from universities and tech communities.

the Pentagon and intelligence experts had sounded a warning: Not only was the North making progress quickly, spy satellite cov-erage was so spotty that the United States might not see a missile being prepared for launch. That set off an urgent but quiet search for ways to improve America’s early-warning ability—and the capability to strike missiles while they are on the launchpad. The most intriguing solutions have come from Silicon Valley, where the Obama administration began investing in tiny, inexpensive civilian satellites developed to count cars in Target parking lots and monitor the growth of crops. Some in the Pentagon accustomed to rely-ing on highly classified, multibillion-dollar satellites, which take years to develop, re-sisted the move. But as North Korea’s mis-sile program progressed, American officials laid out an ambitious schedule for the first of the small satellites to go up at the end of this year, or the beginning of next. Launched in clusters, some staying in orbit just a year or two, the satellites would provide coverage necessary to execute a new military contingency plan called ‘‘Kill Chain.’’ It is the first step in a new strategy to use satellite imagery to identify North Korean launch sites, nuclear facilities and manufacturing capability and destroy them pre-emptively if a conflict seems imminent. Even a few extra minutes of warning might save the lives of tens of thousands of Ameri-cans—and millions of South Koreans and Japanese who already live within range of the North’s missiles. ‘‘Kim Jong-un is racing—literally racing— to deploy a missile capability,’’ Robert Cardillo, the director of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, which co-ordinates satellite-based mapping for the government, said in an interview days before North Korea’s latest launch. ‘‘His accelera-tion has caused us to accelerate.’’ The timeline for getting the satellites in orbit, which defense officials have never dis-cussed publicly, reflects the urgency of the problem. The missile launch by North Korea on Tuesday was initiated from a new site, a mobile launcher at the Pang Hyon Aircraft Factory. Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, said the missile ‘‘is not one we have seen before.’’ That mobility is the problem that the new satellites, with wide coverage using radar sensors that work at night and during storms, are designed to address. Less than one-third of North Korea is under spy sat-ellite coverage at a given moment. American intelligence analysts detected indications of an impending launch in the days before the missile firing, according to a spokesman for the Defense Intelligence Agency, Cmdr. William Marks. But even after the launch, the Pentagon misjudged what it was looking at. Minutes after its 37- minute flight ended, the United States Pa-cific Command described the missile as an intermediate-range model, often seen. Hours later, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson issued a very different conclusion: that the North had tested its first inter-continental ballistic missile, able to reach Alaska. The commercial radar push is one of sev-eral new ways the administration is seeking to counter the North Korean threat. Presi-dent Trump inherited a secret effort to sabo-tage the North’s missile launches. But its success has been spotty at best, especially of late. And joint American-South Korean missile tests, conducted hours after the ICBM test, appeared to be part of the new strategy that includes Kill Chain—the missiles were de-signed to reach Pyongyang, where the coun-try’s leadership lives. Kill Chain was also mentioned in a joint statement issued last week by the United States and South Korea, a notable shift for the South’s new president, Moon Jae-in. He has rejected public discussion of pre-emptive military action, arguing it plays into the North Korean paranoia that the United States and its allies are plotting to end the Kim government. Mr. Moon has spoken of reviving direct talks—a so-called sunshine policy, which he advocated as chief of staff to an earlier South Korean president. But Mr. Trump has tried to build pressure, using warships, sanctions and missile de-fenses. He was recently presented with new options, including military ones, for respond-ing to a sixth nuclear detonation by the North or a test of a missile that could reach the United States. ‘‘The threat is much more immediate,’’ H.R. McMaster, Mr. Trump’s national secu-rity adviser, told a conference last week at the Center for a New American Security in Washington. ‘‘So it’s clear that we can’t re-peat the same approach—failed approach—of the past.’’ The new satellite initiative builds on tech-nology created more for Wall Street than the Pentagon. From an office in an old Defense Department building within view of the Google campus in California, Raj Shah, the director of the Defense Innovation Unit Ex-perimental, or DIUx, is already investing in companies that exploit tiny civilian radar satellites, able to pierce darkness or storms, in hopes that the Pentagon can use them by the end of the year, or early in 2018. ‘‘It’s a very challenging target,’’ said Mr. Shah, a former F-16 pilot in Iraq whose ex-tensive experience in Silicon Valley appealed to Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter, who set up the unit during Mr. Obama’s second term and recruited Mr. Shah. ‘‘The key is using technologies that are al-ready available, and making the modifica-tions we need for a specific military pur-pose,’’ Mr. Shah said. His unit made an investment to jump-start the development efforts of Capella Space, a Silicon Valley start-up named after a bright star. It plans to loft its first radar satellite late this year. The company says its radar fleet, if successfully deployed, will be able to monitor important targets hourly. ‘‘The entire spacecraft is the size of a backpack,’’ said Payam Banazadeh, a found-er of the company. Born in Iran, he learned satellite design at the University of Texas and NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, spe-cializing in miniaturization. Once in orbit, the payload, he added, would unfurl its antenna and solar panels. ‘‘Everything is getting smaller,’’ Mr. Banazadeh said of the craft’s parts. ‘‘Even the next version of the satellite is getting smaller.’’ Seeing the early fruits of the Pentagon ex-periment, the National Geospatial-Intel-ligence Agency is opening its doors to com-panies that can supply it with satellite radar data in addition to traditional images. Its outpost, set up this year, is in San Jose, the heart of Silicon Valley. Federal officials rarely, if ever, acknowl-edge the poor reconnaissance coverage of the North from traditional military satellites. But William J. Perry, the former secretary of defense, recently said in Washington that if the North rolled out a missile to hit the United States or its allies, ‘‘there’s a good chance we’d never see it.’’ The threat grew worse last year as North Korea began using solid fuels after decades of relying on liquid propellants to power its big rockets and missiles. While liquid-fueled missiles can take hours or even days of prep-aration, solid-fueled missiles can be fired with little or no warning. Mr. Kim has made the effort a personal project, posing next to a large solid-fueled motor after a successful ground test last year. The North followed that firing with four successful flight tests, twice last year and twice this year. The advances, said Young-Keun Chang, di-rector of the Global Surveillance Research Center at the Korea Aerospace University in Seoul, moved the North significantly closer to a mobile intercontinental missile that could eventually pose ‘‘a serious potential threat to the United States.’’ The key to detecting launch preparations is the near-constant presence of satellites that can see through clouds, rain, snow, foli-age and camouflage and can detect the movement of military gear, including mis-siles. That requires space-based radars, which over the years have been highly expen-sive, with their big antennas and tendency to use large amounts of power. Like any radar, they fire radio waves at targets and gather faint echoes. Space-based radars can also detect changes in ground elevation that signal hidden tun-nels, bunkers and even radioactive cavities left by nuclear blasts, experts say, because such hollows cause the surface above them to subside ever so slightly. But building the radars has historically been expensive for the government. In 2007, the Congressional Budget Office es-timated that a constellation of 21 radar sat-ellites would cost the nation up to $94 bil-lion—or more than $4 billion each. The re-port, published shortly after the North’s first nuclear detonation, zeroed in on whether the satellites could track Korean missiles on mobile launchers. It called the goal ‘‘highly challenging,’’ and said 35 to 50 spacecraft would be needed to make such detections rapidly. The new generation of tiny, cheap sat-ellites has made that outcome more achiev-able. Capella plans to loft its first radar sat-ellite late this year and build up to 36 orbital radars, within the range the congressional report recommended. In addition to Capella, private companies rushing to make and exploit new generations of small radar satellites include Ursa Space Systems in Ithaca, N.Y.; UrtheCast in Van-couver, Canada; and Iceye in Espoo, Finland. Like many new companies seeking to make small satellites, most have strong ties to Sil-icon Valley. The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency’s initiative, known as the Commer-cial Geoint Activity, builds on programs in which the agency bought radar-satellite data from Canada, Italy and Germany as part of its evaluation of the new civilian tech-nologies. Mr. Cardillo said the new partnerships could help the United States close the gaps in tracking Mr. Kim’s rapidly expanding ar-senal of threatening missiles. ‘‘If any of these companies, new or old, can help fill those gaps,’’ he said, ‘‘then I’m in-terested.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH5742 July 12, 2017 
Hacking for Defense is a class first taught at Stanford and now at growing number of other universities around the country in which students learn to apply lean startup methods to national security challenges. In-structors gather projects or problems from branches of the military and intelligence agencies for the students to address. A core component of the course is gaining an in- depth understanding of the problem the stu-dents are trying to solve, which the students do by conducting 100 interviews with poten-tial ’’customers’’ or beneficiaries of a solu-tion. By the end of the course, although stu-dents aren’t required to come up with a new product or service, many of them do such as the ’’tiny satellites’’ project recently in the news regarding North Korea’s missiles. Hacking for Defense is valuable because it combines a student’s knowledge and entre-preneurial energy with the experience of their business and military mentors to inno-vatively solve national security challenges. In addition, it exposes rising generation of technology stars to the potential value and benefit of careers in national service. Authorization and federal support of this program will enable its expansion to many more universities throughout the country, helping solve high priority problems and train a new generation of civic-minded en-trepreneurs and technologists. I strongly support inclusion of this program in the Na-tional Defense Authorization Act. Respectfully, T

EARREPRESENTATIVE LIPINSKI : As strong supporters of establishing a national secu-rity innovation workforce, we commend your support for the Hacking for Defense Pro-gram, operated under MD5, the National Se-curity Technology Accelerator within the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics. We support your effort to authorize the program and create the option for the Secretary of Defense to expend up to $15 million to ex-pand and strengthen existing programs de-signed to boost Veterans innovation edu-cation. A public-private partnership between the National Defense University and a network of national research universities, MD5 was recognized in the Fiscal Year 2017 National Defense Authorization Act as ″an important pilot program making vital contributions in the field of technology innovation. ″ The pro- gram emphasizes the incentives, outreach, professional military education, and skills- based training necessary to build a National Security Innovation Corps. By leveraging programs like Hacking for Defense (H4D), MD5 is growing a cadre of en-trepreneurs that are adept at critical think-ing, creative problem solving, and the forma-tion of successful ventures that deliver eco-nomic, national security, and social value. H4D classes educate Veterans and other stu-dents in technology innovation and entrepre-neurship, and provide a unique pathway for Veterans to leverage their expertise while learning cutting-edge business innovation methodology, increasing post-military op-portunities and applying their knowledge to new national security problems. Additional funds will help MD5 build on its early success by expanding H4D training to universities nationwide, as well as govern-ment personnel and other organizations re-sponsible for innovation efforts. Funds will be used to expand the development of re-sources, to include Veteran recruitment ma-terials, model curriculum, training mate-rials, and best practices to support univer-sity entrepreneurial education programs.

EAR REPRESENTATIVE LIPINSKI : For over 80 years, Alion has been called upon to solve the nation’s most important and challenging problems. Our original charter in 1936, as Ar-mour Research Foundation (later the Illinois Institute of Technology Research Institute, or ‘‘IITRI’’), identified our purpose: ‘‘to ex-periment upon, test, promote, and develop the public, scientific, and commercial value of inventions, discoveries, and processes.’’ Our focus has remained constant, while we continue to evolve to apply the latest inno-vations in science, technology and engineer-ing to address the needs of this great nation. One innovation still in use today is our de-velopment of the ‘‘Armour alloy,’’ a tita-nium alloy that saved the Air Force’s gas turbine engine program, and is still used in military fighting vehicles and advanced prosthetics. Beginning during the interwar period, continuing through America’s super-power status in the wake of our successful contributions to World War II, and enduring through the rapidly evolving and complex global security environment of the present day, Alion is an important part of the Amer-ican fabric of innovation. Today, Alion stands strong on this solid foundation, supporting customers in defense, civilian government, and commercial indus-tries. Our 21 labs and 2,300-person staff pro-vide Alion the physical and intellectual re-sources to tackle any problem. Our history as an academic research center informs our approach of bringing together the brightest minds and best technologies from wherever they reside: government labs, large industry, universities, or small businesses. For exam-ple, when in 2015 the Secretary of Defense es-tablished a new initiative to expand access to global commercial technology innova-tions, Alion was the first partner to close a deal with a commercial company focused on big data analytics; as we have done many times, Alion brokered an effective trans-lation between military need and commer-cial capabilities, bringing the two together into a successful solution. As strong supporters of establishing a na-tional security innovation workforce, we commend your support for the Hacking for Defense Program, operated under MD5, the National Security Technology Accelerator within the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Lo-gistics. We support your effort to authorize the program and create the option for the Secretary of Defense to expend up to $15 mil-lion to expand and strengthen existing pro-grams designed to boost veterans’ innovation education.

EAR REPRESENTATIVE LIPINSKI : The Uni- versity of Colorado, and its College of Engi-neering and Applied Science, is an avid sup-porter of establishing a strong national secu-rity innovation workforce, and we commend your support for MD5, the National Security Technology Accelerator within the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisi-tion, Technology, and Logistics. We support your effort to authorize the program and cre-ate the option for the Secretary of Defense to expend up to $15 million to expand and strengthen existing programs designed to boost veteran’s innovation education. In our position as the flagship research university in one of the nation’s top Aero-space & Defense economies, we recognize the need to maintain a decisive advantage in technology innovation. Our research part-ners—including Ball Aerospace, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Sierra Nevada Corporation, and Raytheon—routinely em-phasize an increasing need for highly trained, technically competent, agile, and innovative engineers and scientists to ad-dress the most pressing technology chal-lenges in National Security. As the newest member of MD5, we believe programs like Hacking for Defense (H4D) are critical to developing a strong corps of fu-ture entrepreneurs that are adept at critical thinking, creative problem solving, and the formation of successful ventures that deliver economic, national security, and social value. The H4D curriculum educates vet-erans and other students in technology inno-vation and entrepreneurship, and provides a unique pathway to leverage their expertise while learning cutting-edge business innova-tion methodology and applying their knowl-edge to new national security problems. Additional funding will help MD5 build on its early success by expanding H4D training to universities and other innovation organi-zations nationwide. Funds will be used to ex-pand the development of resources, to in-clude veteran recruitment materials, model curriculum, training materials, and best practices that will further enhance our uni-versity entrepreneurial education programs.

H4D classes educate veterans and other students in technology innovation and entrepreneurship, and provide a unique path-way for veterans to leverage their expertise while learning cutting-edge business innova-tion methodology, increasing post-military opportunities and applying their knowledge to new national security problems. I have personally seen the positive impact to the Government agencies we support in both the H4D definition of problems and in the engagement of innovative sources of ideas to solve them. An example of one of the teams I helped to mentor was Capella Space at Stanford University, who is now VC fund-ed and working on national defense problems in radar that even the Multi-Billion defense contractors weren’t interested in investing IR&D funding. This is a win-win situation in the activation of non-traditional sources of innovation for DoD and the driving of solu-tions that impact national security. Additional funds will help MDS build on its early success by expanding H4D training to universities nationwide, as well as govern-ment personnel and other organizations re-sponsible for innovation efforts. Funds will be used to expand the development of re-sources, to include veteran recruitment ma-terials, model curriculum, training mate-rials, and best practices to support univer-sity entrepreneurial education programs.

Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Chair, the second amendment deals with cybersecurity standards. At the end of 2016, the DOD issued important updated cybersecurity standards for defense contractors. Companies must implement these new standards by January 1, 2018. However, I have heard from a number of small manufacturers in my district that it is very difficult getting the information and expertise necessary to institute these standards. They fear this may mean the end of their companies. America cannot afford to lose these small businesses, so my amendment en-courages the Secretary of Defense to establish a cooperative program be-tween the DOD and MIST to educate and assist small- and medium-sized manufacturing firms in achieving com-pliance with the updated cybersecurity standards. This would help improve cybersecu-rity access across the defense supply chain while also preserving competi-tion for DOD contracts. It has received broad support from the business and technology community. Mr. Chair, I thank the chair and ranking member for supporting these two amendments in this bloc and the next. I ask my colleagues to support these amendments. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from New Jer-sey (Mr. GOTTHEIMER ). Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this bipartisan amendment to reauthorize the Suicide Prevention and Resilience Program to 2019. This is a critical program that pro-vides members of the National Guard and Reserves, as well as their families, with training in suicide prevention, re-silience, and community healing re-sources. We simply cannot allow this critical suicide prevention program to expire, not for the men and women who are or have been on the front lines. Our Na-tion’s veterans deserve the best care after putting their lives on the line to protect the freedoms we hold dear. My bipartisan amendment reauthor-izes and extends this program to im-prove safety and ensure continuity and peace of mind for the men and women who serve. Just one soldier lost to suicide is too many. We should do everything in our power to help as many servicemembers as we can. National Guardsmen and Reservists face unique challenges. They are cit-izen soldiers who do not live on a base. They often leave their jobs and fami-lies on a moment’s notice to suit up to protect us. Even a great Guardsman or Reservist may not know when and how to ask for help, yet these men and women still need access to support systems and community networks to help identify potential mental health issues. That is why it is critical that we extend this program to protect the well-being of all of our soldiers. I am proud to offer this amendment in honor of those who serve in the New Jersey Guard and Reserve and across the Nation, as well as for their fami-lies. I thank my colleague, Congress-woman M
CSALLY , for her leadership on this issue and for her advocacy on be-half of all servicemembers. I also thank Chairman T
HORNBERRY  and Ranking Member S
MITH for their important work on this critical legisla-tion. I look forward to coming together as Democrats and Republicans to de-fend our Nation and protect all of those who serve. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I urge adoption of the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.

Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of Mr. Rogers’ amend-ment allocating additional base funding for one of our nation’s most critical battle management command and control platforms: the E–8C Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar Sys-tem, or JSTARS fleet. JSTARS’ critical mission is enabled by leveraging its extremely capable active radar system providing invaluable moving target in-dicator (MTI) intelligence, surveillance, and re-connaissance targeting information to multiple users both on the ground and in airborne at-tack platforms. The demand for MTI capability within each geographic combatant commander’s area of responsibility far exceeds what JSTARS can currently provide due to its limited legacy fleet size of 16 aircraft and strained crew re-sources. Thankfully, FY18 NDAA includes JSTARS Recapitalization funds, but the legacy fleet of 16 aircraft still has issues and challenges that the Air Force must successfully navigate to maintain viability until the current fleet is re-placed by the Recapitalization program begin-ning in the late 2020s. Despite these issues and challenges, we are confident that the Secretary of the Air Force can develop a successful legacy JSTARS to JSTARS Recapitalization transition plan that would not prematurely retire E–8C aircraft, reassign crews or maintenance per-sonnel, or otherwise increase the MTI ISR ca-pability gap from what existing levels of air-craft are currently experiencing. To do this, we need strong support and nec-essary resources. That’s why I’m here tonight in supporting additional resources for the JSTARS legacy fleet to update and maintain their critical battle management capabilities. As the premiere military in the world, we cannot afford to let this important military ca-pability deteriorate before our eyes, putting our warfighters and strategic campaigns at risk around the world. One of the greatest duties we have as Members of Congress is to provide for our na-tion’s defense, and I urge my colleagues to support this measure as well as other provi-sions supporting our warfighters and ensuring our men and women in uniform have the re-sources they need to meet the unique security needs of the 21st century.

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 431, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. T
HORNBERRY ) and the gentleman from Washington (Mr. S
MITH) each will control 10 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I have no requests for time, and I simply urge adoption of this package of en bloc amendments. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may con-sume just to clean up a couple of ear-lier debates we had on amendments. I just wanted to make a couple of argu-ments. On the nuclear weapons issue, I just want to be clear, we support a strong and robust nuclear deterrence. We are not advocating unilateral disarmament by any stretch of the imagination. We are simply asking: In the budget challenge environment that we have, is this the best use of our money to to-tally rebuild our entire nuclear weap-ons system? And the amendments that were of-fered weren’t even necessarily saying no. They are just saying this is some-thing we ought to study and ought to talk about. And I will, however, disagree with one argument that was made about how somehow it is a myth that over the last 70 years, all of our adversaries are building nuclear weapons in re-sponse to the nuclear weapons that we have built. I think that is a big misreading of history. We all recall that we were first to the table on this. And thank goodness we were. It enabled us to end World War II. But we are still the only nation on Earth that has actually used nuclear weapons. And when the Soviet Union developed theirs, we had them and they didn’t. And I think it is a little ridicu-lous to assume that no part of their thinking was that: Well, if the United States of America, our prime adversary, has nuclear weapons, we better have them, too. 
And then we saw the arms race accel-erate, even to the point of the famous debate in 1960, how candidate J
OHN K
ENNEDY talked about the missile gap that we had. That turned out to be a total fabrication. It wasn’t true. We didn’t have that gap. It was unfair to what the Eisenhower administration was doing. But the argument from the other side that the notion of an arms race is ridiculous is something that I think is wrong. Arms races do happen. And part of what we need to do in working with our adversaries is to try to contain them in a reasonable fashion. So I do believe that in many cases, it becomes a self- perpetuating thing. We build them, they build them; we build them, they build them. And I hope that part of our nuclear strategy isn’t just building as many nuclear weapons as is humanly possible, but is actually opening up lines of communication with potential adversaries like China, with adver-saries like Russia. Now, I will grant you that where North Korea is concerned, and as I have said repeatedly, we have to deter them, but we have the power to destroy North Korea, I think, hundreds of times over. We have the capacity in terms of our weapons systems to deter them.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH5748 July 12, 2017 
So I hope, as we look at modernizing our nuclear weapons systems, we will consider the cost and the effectiveness of doing that. And I know Mr. R
OGERS  has offered his thoughtful amendment to give the Department of Defense some opportunity to do that, but that is all we were trying to say on that. On BRAC, a couple of arguments were made at the end there that were somewhat misleading. One was that Secretary Mattis had said that he wanted to totally relook at the situa-tion, implying that Secretary Mattis didn’t think that a BRAC was a good idea. The Pentagon—President Donald Trump’s Pentagon and Secretary Mattis’ Pentagon—recommended a BRAC round that we rejected. So make no mistake about it, the Republican President and Secretary Mattis sup-port a BRAC round. And two more minor points. It was argued that, well, we voted for this bill 60 to 1 out of committee, so we were all in favor of it. Yes, not all, but we were in favor of the bill. This was a small piece of that bill. So to argue in a bill— and forgive me, I don’t know how many pages this year’s bill is. I know last year’s was 1,600—that in a 1,600-page bill, if you vote for it, you have got to support absolutely everything in it is a notion that I don’t think any Member would support. Again, I will emphasize an argument that I made with Mr. W
ILSON on the no-tion that, well, gosh, they don’t have a study, they haven’t looked at it, they haven’t thought about what they are going to do, when, in fact, it is Con-gress that has prohibited them legisla-tively— and I don’t know how many of the last few years, but several of them—from doing that. Let’s at least let them take a look at it to give us the numbers, because the same point as the nuclear weapons issue, as we have heard over and over today, we have crucial readiness short-falls. In many ways I will agree with the chairman: we are right now not doing right by the men and women who serve in the military by not providing them with the training and the equipment they need to do the missions that we are contemplating having them do. And if that is the case, if we can find savings by not building as many nu-clear weapons as we need or by closing institutions that we do not need, then I think that is something that we owe the men and women who serve in the military. And let’s not kid ourselves. This is a very parochial issue. There are a whole bunch of bases in the State of Wash-ington. I don’t want to see any of them closed, but if the military decides that that is the best thing to do, I am not going to stand in the way of it. And I hope, given the dire situation that we face that has been described by my Republican colleagues, that we would put parochial concerns to the side and do what is best for the mili-tary, to make sure that we are spend-ing the money as wisely as we possibly can and to make absolutely certain that the men and women who serve are trained, equipped, and ready to fight whatever fight it is we ask them to go into. Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of the second en bloc amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. b2300 Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may con-sume. Mr. Chairman, I want to take a mo-ment to address the topics that the gentleman from Washington addressed. First off, I completely agree with him. This bill that we are considering today, tomorrow, and the next day is about 1,000 pages. I don’t agree with it all. It has everything from missile de-fense to helping spouses pay licenses when they are forced to move from State to State, and I suspect I will not agree with it all at the end of the day. What is important, though, is the overriding obligation we have to sup-port the men and women who risk their lives to protect us. So, I think the gen-tleman is exactly right. Just because you vote for the bill does not mean you endorse everything in it. And at the same time, even if you disagree with some of the things in it, it is important to support the men and women who serve by voting for the bill, even if you have disagreements. I completely con-cur with the gentleman on that. When it comes to the nuclear issue, there are a few points I want to make that maybe were not made during the previous debates. Number one is we have drastically fewer nuclear weapons now than we had during the Cold War. I think a lot of people do not realize how signifi-cantly fewer weapons and delivery sys-tems we have now than we had all dur-ing the fifties, sixties, seventies, and into the eighties. But these are still machines. They do not live forever. Whether you are talk-ing about the weapon itself or the de-livery systems, they age; and, as they age, there are chemical reactions, parts wear out, and things change. So they have to be modernized if our deterrent is to remain credible. Now, you can get into an argument about, okay, how many weapons does it take to be credible and what delivery systems are required to penetrate de-fenses, to hold enough targets at risk, to have that credible defense, but what I think there can be little debate about is that the world is growing more dan-gerous in the nuclear field. We have seen what happened with North Korea. There is enormous concern about what happens in the Middle East and else-where. I believe that our nuclear deterrent is the foundation upon which the rest of our defense efforts are built, and that foundation must remain credible. It has to be rebuilt. My understanding is the estimates are at no point will re-building that entire nuclear deterrent require more than 7 percent of any year’s defense budget, 7 percent for the foundation and 93 percent for the House that is built on it. It is essential that we maintain that credible deterrent, and it has got to be big enough to be credible so that a country like China does not think they can build a few more weapons and get to parity with the United States. On the subject of BRAC, I do disagree with the gentleman from Washington on this point. Two years ago, I specifi-cally asked that we have included in the bill that was signed into law a re-quirement that the Pentagon provide us with an updated cost estimate on excess infrastructure. What we have all been citing is a 2004 estimate that there is about 20 percent excess infrastructure. Twenty-two per-cent is the number that is often used. What we got back was seven pages of nothing. By the way, that was not prohibited by the bill. It was required by the bill. What I am interested in is a real up-dated, data-driven study that shows whether we have excess infrastructure and of what sort. And I think that is exactly what Secretary Mattis said. Let me quote his exact sentence: I am not comfortable right now that we have a full 20-some percent excess infrastruc-ture. I need to go back through and look at this again because I don’t want to get rid of something that we can’t sustain and then say we have got to go buy some land here in 10 years. 
I think that is what we need is an up-dated study. And if it shows that we have got excess infrastructure, I am not at all opposed to having another round of BRAC. I am very opposed to having another round like 2005, which, I believe, it is either CBO or GAO, I can’t remember which, says has not yet broken even 12 years later. It still costs more money than it has, and it has not started to save yet. So I don’t want a repeat of that. I am interested if it shows that we do have excess infrastructure and a way to deal with that. Secretary Mattis, I believe, shares that view, but until we see the data, I am not supportive of an-other round. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. THORNBERRY. I yield to the gentleman. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, it is not clear that it has got a prohibition on a study, nor does it call for one. So as we get into conference, I think it might be a worthwhile thing to say that we authorize, ask—you know, and I am not sure if this is something the Defense Department can do without our authorization or not, but it is something that we should discuss as we get into conference, to have them do that study. I think that would be an excellent first step, but I am not sure that we

cover it in this bill. Maybe we do, and we can figure that out over the course of the next 48 hours. But if it doesn’t, that is something that I think we ought to try to do. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the point. I am not con-vinced that the gentleman and I really differ on this point. What the bill says, now, is: ‘‘Nothing in this act shall be construed to au-thorize an additional base alignment and closure round.’’ That is what it says. It says we don’t authorize it, of course. It does not prohibit a study to say whether we ought to. Again, I would welcome a real data-driven study that will help us reach that con-clusion. Mr. Chairman, this is just further evidence that there is a wide range of issues and discussions to have on this bill, all for that purpose of supporting the men and women who serve our Na-tion. I support en bloc package No. 2. I urge my colleagues to, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of the bipartisan amendment I intro-duced with Congressman T
OMROONEY from Florida. The amendment would require the Secretary of Defense to report to Congress within 180 days on the implementation of rec-ommendations from a recent Government Ac-countability Office (GAO) report entitled ‘‘Ac-tions Needed to Ensure Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and Traumatic Brain Injury Are Con-sidered in Misconduct Separations,’’ which was released in May 2017. GAO found that some of the service branch policies related to the consideration of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in ‘‘other than honorable’’ discharges were inconsistent with Department of Defense policy. To remedy these inconsistencies, DOD issued five recommendations. As the co-chair and co-founder of the Con-gressional Brain Injury Task Force, I have worked to address the effects brain injuries have on both the military and civilian popu-lations. TBI and PTSD have been recognized as the signature injuries of the Wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Estimates from the RAND Corporation in 2008 estimated that nearly 20 percent—or 320,000—of the 1.6 million men and women deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan sustained a brain injury while in the line of duty. Additionally, between 11–20 percent of Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Free-dom have PTSD in a given year, according to the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA). Given the impact that TBI and PTSD have on an individual’s behavior and decision-mak-ing skills, it is imperative that these conditions are accurately diagnosed in a timely manner. It is also important that these conditions re-ceive appropriate consideration when a serv-icemember is discharged for misconduct. Ac-cording to the GAO’s report, in the case of 16 percent of the separations for misconduct that the GAO examined, the servicemembers suf-fered from PTSD or TBI. Additionally, the GAO found that two of the four branches of the mili-tary have policies inconsistent with DOD’s pol-icy on the impact of TBI and PTSD on separa-tions for misconduct. It is troubling that the Army and Marine Corps may not have ad-hered to their own screening, training, and counseling policies related to PTSD and TBI. That is why it is imperative that DOD’s policies are implemented consistently across all of the military services and that there is adequate oversight of adherence. When an individual receives an ‘‘other than honorable’’ discharge, he or she may not be eligible for health benefits through the VA. A lack of health coverage is problematic for any-one, but especially so for individuals suffering from TBI or PTSD. DOD policy requires that servicemembers requesting separation in lieu of trial by court-martial be counseled on the negative consequences of this type of separa-tion. However, of the 48 separation packets the GAO examined, 11 had unclear or un-documented evidence that counseling took place. If servicemembers are agreeing to less than honorable discharges, they need to un-derstand the consequences of that decision. After the release of this report, I sent a letter to DOD Secretary James Mattis urging him to give due consideration to the recommenda-tions made by the GAO. We must ensure the department provides accurate and timely diag-nosis of PTSD and TBI in determining separa-tion for misconduct, consistent policies across all branches of the military with accountability, and adequate counseling for servicemembers about the consequences of separation for mis-conduct, including the loss of health benefits. This amendment is supported by the Brain Injury Association of America, the National As-sociation of State Head Injury Administrators, and the U.S. Brain Injury Alliance. The Acting CHAIR.

ROHRABACHER OF CALIFORNIA  At the end of subtitle B of title XII, add the following: 
SEC. 12xx. SENSE OF CONGRESS RELATING TO DR. SHAKIL AFRIDI. 
(a) F INDINGS .—Congress finds the fol-lowing: (1) The attacks of September 11, 2001, killed approximately 3,000 people, most of whom were Americans, but also included hundreds of individuals with foreign citizen-ships, nearly 350 New York Fire Department personnel, and about 50 law enforcement offi-cers. (2) Downed United Airlines flight 93 was re-portedly intended, under the control of the al-Qaeda high-jackers, to crash into the White House or the Capitol in an attempt to kill the President of the United States or Members of the United States Congress. (3) The September 11, 2001, attacks were largely planned and carried out by the al- Qaeda terrorist network led by Osama bin Laden and his deputy Ayman al Zawahiri, after which Osama bin Laden enjoyed safe haven in Pakistan from where he continued to plot deadly attacks against the United States and the world. (4) Since 2001, the United States has pro-vided more than $30 billion in security and economic aid to Pakistan. (5) The United States very generously and swiftly responded to the 2005 Kashmir Earth-quake in Pakistan with more than $200 mil-lion in emergency aid and the support of sev-eral United States military aircraft, approxi-mately 1,000 United States military per-sonnel, including medical specialists, thou-sands of tents, blankets, water containers and a variety of other emergency equipment. (6) The United States again generously and swiftly contributed approximately $150 mil-lion in emergency aid to Pakistan following the 2010 Pakistan flood, in addition to the service of nearly twenty United States mili-tary helicopters, their flight crews, and other resources to assist the Pakistan Army’s relief efforts. (7) The United States continues to work tirelessly to support Pakistan’s economic de-velopment, including millions of dollars allo-cated towards the development of Pakistan’s energy infrastructure, health services and education system. (8) The United States and Pakistan con-tinue to have many critical shared interests, both economic and security related, which could be the foundation for a positive and mutually beneficial partnership. (9) Dr. Shakil Afridi, a Pakistani physi-cian, is a hero to whom the people of the United States, Pakistan and the world owe a debt of gratitude for his help in finally locat-ing Osama bin Laden before more innocent American, Pakistani and other lives were lost to this terrorist leader. (10) Pakistan, the United States and the international community had failed for near-ly 10 years following attacks of September 11, 2001, to locate and bring Osama bin Laden, who continued to kill innocent civil-ians in the Middle East, Asia, Europe, Africa and the United States, to justice without the help of Dr. Afridi. (11) The Government of Pakistan’s impris-onment of Dr. Afridi presents a serious and growing impediment to the United States’ bilateral relations with Pakistan. (12) The Government of Pakistan has lev-eled and allowed baseless charges against Dr. Afridi in a politically motivated, spurious legal process. (13) Dr. Afridi is currently imprisoned by the Government of Pakistan, a deplorable and unconscionable situation which calls into question Pakistan’s actual commitment to countering terrorism and undermines the notion that Pakistan is a true ally in the struggle against terrorism. (b) SENSE OF CONGRESS .—It is the sense of Congress that Dr. Shakil Afridi is an inter-national hero and that the Government of Pakistan should release him immediately from prison.

to develop a ballistic and nuclear weapons development program that poses a grave threat to the United States, United States allies the Republic of Korea, Japan, and Aus-tralia, and to regional and global security. (2) North Korea continues to escalate the pace and number of its ballistic missile launches, and to date has conducted five nu-clear tests. (3) On July 4, 2017, North Korea conducted the first test of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) it claims is capable of reach-ing United States territory, which, if reliable and effective, constitutes a new threat to America’s security. (4) On June 3, 2017, Secretary of Defense James Mattis stated, during remarks at the Shangri-La Dialogue, that ‘‘the current North Korea program signals a clear intent to acquire nuclear armed ballistic missiles, including those of intercontinental range that pose direct and immediate threats to our allies, our partners and all the world’’. (5) On April 27, 2017, Admiral Harry Harris, Jr., Commander of the United States Pacific Command, testified that ‘‘North Korea con-tinues to disregard United Nations sanctions by developing, and threatening to use inter-continental ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons that will threaten the U.S. Home-land.’’. (b) S
ENSE OF CONGRESS .—It is the sense of Congress that— (1) the United States should act to counter North Korea’s continued development and testing of nuclear weapons and interconti-nental ballistic missiles; (2) the development of a functional and operational North Korean nuclear and inter-continental ballistic missile program con-stitutes a threat to the security of the United States and to our allies and partners in the region; (3) the defense of the United States and our allies against North Korean aggression re-mains a top priority, and the United States maintains an unwavering and steadfast com-mitment to the policy of extended deter-rence, especially with respect to South Korea and Japan; (4) the United States supports the deploy-ment of the Terminal High Altitude Area De-fense (THAAD) system in South Korea to counter North Korea’s missile threat and the deployment of ballistic missile defense sys-tems to allies in the Indo-Asia-Pacific region to protect from the growing threat of North Korea’s nuclear weapons and ballistic mis-sile programs; (5) the United States should encourage fur-ther multilateral security cooperation and dialogue among South Korea, Japan, and Australia to address the North Korea threat; (6) the United States calls upon the Peo-ple’s Republic of China to use its leverage to pressure North Korea to cease its provoca-tive behavior and abandon and dismantle its nuclear and ballistic missile programs, and comply with all relevant United Nations Se-curity Council resolutions; (7) the United States should fully enforce all existing sanctions on North Korea and undertake a comprehensive diplomatic effort to urge allies and other countries to fully en-force, and build upon, existing international sanctions; and (8) the United States should retain diplo-matic, economic, and military options to de-fend against and pressure North Korea to abandon its illicit weapons program.

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 431, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. THORNBERRY ) and the gentleman from Washington (Mr. S

Mr. Chairman, I urge Members to support en bloc pack-age No. 3, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I urge Members to support the en bloc package, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. HANABUSA. Mr. Chair, thank you for this opportunity to highlight my amendment, floor amendment Number 58 to H.R. 2810, the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). Among the battles fought by the United States (U.S.) during World War II were many battles throughout the Pacific, sometimes re-ferred to as the Asia-Pacific. From 1941 through 1945, U.S. service members fought on land, in the air, and at sea through numer-ous South Pacific islands to secure peace and defend our democracy and freedom. Our na-tion suffered over 150,000 casualties in the war. My amendment recognizes that while Pearl Harbor memorializes the beginning of the Pa-cific War (the USS Arizona) and the end of the Pacific War (the USS Missouri), there is no memorial honoring our service members who defended our country and gave their lives dur-ing the Pacific War. As such, my amendment expresses the sense of Congress that there should be such a memorial established at or near the Pearl Harbor site of the World War II Valor in the Pacific National Monument in Honolulu, Hawai‘i. The idea for a Pacific War Memorial origi-nated with Admiral Lloyd ‘‘Joe’’ Vasey, who turned 100 years old earlier this year. Admiral Vasey served aboard the submarine USS Gunnel in the Pacific during World War II, under John S. McCain, Jr., father of U.S. Sen-ator J
OHN MCCAIN. During a fierce battle aboard the Gunnel, Admiral Vasey thought to himself, ‘‘There has to be a better way to re-solve international disputes.’’ Years later, Ad-miral Vasey put that thought into action and founded the Center for Strategic and Inter-national Studies (CSIS), also known as the Pacific Forum, to promote peace in the Asia- Pacific. In the words of Admiral Vasey: ‘‘There is no recognition of the brave Americans who were lost in the Pacific War...  They are resting on the bottom of the Pacific Ocean some-where, or their remains are scattered across the South Pacific islands. We need to honor them, and their families need a place to mourn.’’ I wholeheartedly agree with Admiral Vasey and feel strongly that the location of such a memorial should be in Hawai‘i, preferably at Pearl Harbor near the USS Arizona and USS Missouri. It would be fitting to share the stories of the brave service members who fought and gave their lives in the Pacific War alongside sites that commemorate events and other U.S. service members of the Pacific during World War II. I thank my House colleagues for supporting Admiral Vasey’s idea and my amendment to H.R. 2810. I look forward to continuing my work with my colleagues to make Admiral

SEC. 12ll. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY ORGANIZATION. 
(a) F INDINGS .—Congress finds the fol-lowing: (1) The North Atlantic Treaty Organiza-tion (NATO) has been the cornerstone of transatlantic security cooperation and an enduring instrument for promoting stability in Europe and around the world for over 65 years. (2) NATO currently faces a range of secu-rity challenges, including Russian aggression in Eastern Europe and instability and con-flict in the Middle East and North Africa. (3) In light of these and other threats, NATO must have a credible deterrence to de-fend NATO members, if necessary, against adversaries or threats. (4) Since the 2014 NATO summit in Wales and the 2016 summit in Warsaw, NATO has made progress in implementing a Readiness Action Plan to enhance allied readiness and collective defense in response to Russian ag-gression. However, much work remains to be done. (5) NATO’s solidarity is strengthened by bolstering its conventional and nuclear de-terrence, increasing defense spending by NATO members, and continuing the enlarge-ment of NATO. (b) S
ENSE OF CONGRESS .—It is the sense of Congress that— (1) NATO members should— (A) continue to advance the NATO Open- Door Policy and build on the successes of previous enlargement initiatives; (B) continue to work with countries that are seeking to join NATO to prepare for entry; (C) commend Montenegro’s final accession to NATO; (D) seek a Dayton II agreement to resolve the constitutional issues faced by Bosnia and Herzegovina; (E) work with the Republic of Kosovo to prepare the country for entrance into the NATO Partnership for Peace program; (F) continue support for the NATO Mem-bership Action Plan for Georgia; (G) implement specific plans to ensure that sufficient investments are made to meet NATO responsibilities, including by allo-cating at least 2 percent of each member’s gross domestic product to defense spending, 20 percent of which should be dedicated to major equipment procurement, as agreed at the 2014 Wales Summit and reaffirmed at the 2016 Warsaw Summit; (H) continue to build on efforts to identify and address, through consensus, the security threats facing the alliance, such as by en-hancing counterterrorism activities; (I) continue to bolster deterrence efforts and promote the Enhanced Forward Presence in Eastern Europe; (J) as decided at the 2016 Warsaw Summit, use the new rotational deployments of four multinational combat battalions in Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia to promote stability in that region as well as to deter Russian aggression; and (K) invest in infrastructure projects nec-essary to guarantee free and efficient move-ment throughout the territories of NATO members; and (2) the United States should commit to maintaining a robust military presence in Europe as a means of promoting allied inter-operability, providing visible assurance to NATO allies, and deterring Russian aggres-sion in the region.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH5754 July 12, 2017 
SEC. 12ll. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE CHIBOK SCHOOLGIRLS AND BOKO HARAM. 
(a) F INDINGS .—Congress finds the fol-lowing: (1) . The members of Jama’atu Ahlis Sunna Lidda’awati wal-Jihad, commonly known as Boko Haram, have terrorized the people of Nigeria with increasing violence since 2009, targeting military, government, and civilian sites in Nigeria, including schools, mosques, churches, markets, villages, and agricultural centers, and killing thousands and abducting hundreds of civilians in Nigeria and the sur-rounding countries. (2) On the night of April 14, 2014, 276 female students, most of them between 15 and 18 years old, were abducted by Boko Haram from the Chibok Government Girls Sec-ondary School, a boarding school located in Borno state in the Federal Republic of Nige-ria. (3) While some Chibok girls have fled their captors and others have been released through negotiations, more than 100 Chibok girls remain in captivity. (4) In addition to kidnapping the Chibok schoolgirls, Boko Haram has killed more than 20,000 people, coerced women and girls into carrying out suicide missions, displaced more than 3,000,000 Nigerians, tens of thou-sands of whom are at risk of starving to death, and caused thousand of school clo-sures. (5) In supporting efforts to reunite the Chibok schoolgirls with their families, the United States has authorized the deployment of military personnel to assist with intel-ligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, and provided training, equipment, and hu-manitarian services to the populations af-fected by and vulnerable to Boko Haram vio-lence. (6) The Secretary of State designated sev-eral individuals linked to Boko Haram, in-cluding its leader, Abubakar Shekau, as Spe-cially Designated Global Terrorists in 2012, and designated Boko Haram as a Foreign Terrorist Organization in November 2013. (7) The Senate and the House of Represent-atives have both passed legislation and un-dertaken other initiatives to condemn Boko Haram and support the Chibok schoolgirls. (8) In addition to legislation, members of Congress have traveled to Nigeria to meet with freed Chibok schoolgirls and their fami-lies, held briefings, press conferences, and hearings, and, every week that Congress is in session, participated in Wear Something Red Wednesday, a bipartisan campaign led by Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, Republican Conference Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers, and Congresswoman Frederica Wilson, dur-ing which lawmakers wear a red outfit or ac-cessory and take group photos to share on social media to raise awareness about the kidnapped Chibok schoolgirls. (9) The 114th Congress unanimously passed S. 1632, which President Barack Obama signed into law on December 14, 2016, to di-rect the Secretary of State and the Sec-retary of Defense to jointly develop a five- year strategy to aid Nigeria and the Multi-national Joint Task Force, composed of troops from Benin, Cameroon, Chad, Niger, and Nigeria, to combat Boko Haram. (10) On June 27, 2017, President Donald Trump met with two freed Chibok school-girls at the White House. (b) S
ENSE OF CONGRESS .—Congress— (1) commends the Secretary of State, Sec-retary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence for delivering a report to Con-gress on a five-year strategy for the United States to employ diplomatic, development, defense, and other tools to assist and enable our African partners to lead the effort to de-grade and ultimately defeat Boko Haram, the Islamic State in Iraq and ash Sham – West Africa (ISIS-WA), and any potential splinter or successor groups; (2) affirms United States support for the international effort to degrade Boko Haram and ISIS-WA and to assist the Multinational Joint Task Force to address the underlying drivers of violent extremism; and (3) supports the efforts of the Department of Defense to implement a United States strategy for countering Boko Haram and ISIS-WA.

(3) According to the report of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence dated January 6, 2017, on the Russian Federation’s hack of the United States presidential elec-tion: ‘‘Russian efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election represent the most re-cent expression of Moscow’s longstanding de-sire to undermine the US-led liberal demo-cratic order.’’. (4) As recently as May 4, 2017, the press re-ported a massive cyber hack of French Presi-dent Emmanuel Macron’s campaign, likely attributable to Russian actors. (5) It is in the core interests of the United States to enhance the offensive and defen-sive cyber capabilities of NATO member states to deter and defend against Russian cyber and influence operations. (6) Enhanced offensive cyber capabilities would enable the United States to dem-onstrate strength and deter the Russian Fed-eration from threatening NATO, while reas-suring allies, without a provocative buildup of conventional military forces.

PRAYER The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-fered the following prayer: Let us pray. Eternal God, You alone reign su-preme in our Nation and world. May our lawmakers permit You to direct their steps. Give our Senators a re-newed sense of Your sacred presence, filling them with reverence for You. May this reverence engender in them a spirit of profound gratitude for Your goodness and grace. Lord, inspire them to live such exem-plary lives that Your Name will be glo-rified in the Earth. Help them to relin-quish all anxieties to You, as they re-member Your promise to supply all their needs. May they dedicate them-selves to providing opportunities and justice for all Americans. And, Lord, bring comfort to the fami-lies of our military personnel killed in the C–130 crash in Mississippi. We pray in Your merciful Name. Amen.

HEALTHCARE LEGISLATION Mr. M
CCONNELL. Madam President, I have often come to the floor to relay the stories of Kentuckians who have suffered under ObamaCare. Under ObamaCare, Kentuckians have seen their premiums skyrocket—by an average of 75 percent since 2013. Under ObamaCare, Kentuckians have seen their options for health insurance plummet. This year, families living in 90 percent of the counties in Kentucky will have little or no options of insur-ers to pick from; that is, two options or less. We all know the statistics in our own States. We also know the pain of ObamaCare is about far more than just numbers on a page. Behind each of ObamaCare’s unaffordable premium in-creases, there is a family struggling to make ends meet. Behind all the can-celed plans and restricted choices, there are countless individuals who have been left behind by this failing law. Today Vice President PENCE is trav-eling to Lexington in my State to hear directly from my constituents, includ-ing small business owners who have struggled under ObamaCare. As the Vice President knows, ObamaCare’s pain is about more than just sky-rocketing costs and plummeting choices; its taxes, mandates, and heavy-handed regulations hurt too. They have subjected small businesses across the country to serious chal-lenges. ObamaCare has been hurting the men and women we represent for many years in many different ways. I am thankful we finally have an adminis-tration that seems to care, an adminis-tration that has made a real effort to actually listen to those who have been forced to endure the negative con-sequences of this failing law. ObamaCare has been spiraling toward collapse for years. Today it teeters on the brink of total meltdown, threat-ening to hurt even more of our friends and loved ones. We really can’t allow that to happen. Doing nothing about ObamaCare is simply not an option. That is why we have been working hard to move be-yond the failures of ObamaCare with Better Care legislation. We want to stabilize and reform the collapsing in-surance markets, we want to put down-ward pressure on premiums, and we want to put upward lift on choice. We want to give States dramatic new tools that can drive a new era of improved health outcomes, especially for those most in need, and we want to put more affordable insurance in reach for Amer-icans ObamaCare continues to leave behind. If we sit on our hands, families will continue to suffer. If we let this oppor-tunity to move beyond ObamaCare pass us by, what other options will there be? One idea from the Democratic leader is simply to throw money at insurance companies—no reforms, no changes, just a multibillion-dollar bandaid. Another idea from many other Demo-crats is to quadruple down on ObamaCare with a government-run sin-gle-payer system. It is called single payer because there is just one payer— one payer: the government. Nearly every healthcare decision would be de-cided by a Federal bureaucrat. Taxes could go up astronomically. The total cost could add up to $32 trillion, ac-cording to an estimate of a leading pro-posal. Now, Americans deserve better than a massive expansion of a failed idea. Americans deserve better than a band-aid. Americans deserve better than ObamaCare. What they really deserve is better care, and we continue to work together to provide it. We are having productive discussions about the future of healthcare, just like we should be doing, and soon it will be time to move those discussions right out here to the Senate floor. Once we proceed to the bill, Mem-bers—Republicans and Democrats alike—will have the opportunity to en-gage in robust debate and a robust amendment process right here on the Senate floor. I am sure Members will

have other good ideas then, and I hope they will offer them. They will cer-tainly have the opportunity to offer them, but if the Senate is prevented from even proceeding to the bill, none of us will have an opportunity—not Re-publicans, not Democrats, not anyone. I regret that our Democratic col-leagues made clear from the outset that they weren’t interested in work-ing seriously with us to pursue the kind of comprehensive reforms needed to truly move beyond the pain of ObamaCare, but they will have a new opportunity soon. Once we get on the bill, they will have another chance to offer their solutions. I hope they will offer more than just a bandaid. I hope they will offer more than just a $32 trillion reup of a failed idea. Whatever they would like to propose, I hope they will take the chance to open debate and advance the legisla-tive process—for every Senator, for every American. Leaving the American people to suf-fer under the ObamaCare status quo, I think, is unacceptable. We have seen the pain in our home States. We have seen the heartbreak all across our country. The American people are rely-ing on us to bring them real relief, so we will keep working hard to deliver just that. 
f 
NOMINATIONS Mr. M
CCONNELL. Madam President, on another matter, yesterday I shared some data reflecting the historic level of obstruction Senate Democrats have displayed when it comes to confirming our President’s nominees. I noted that the opposition they have shown to these nominees most of the time seems to have little to do with the nominees themselves, nor whether or not Demo-crats even support them. In many cases, our Democratic colleagues actu-ally support the nominees. Take the nominee before us today for a U.S. district court judge in Idaho. He was reported out of committee on a voice vote. Every single Democrat then voted for cloture on his nomination. Yet Democrats still chose to throw up procedural hurdles to a nominee for whom they have no objection. In fact, Senate Democrats have con-tinuously forced procedural hurdles more than 30 times, compared to only 8 cloture votes Republicans required on nominees at this point in President Obama’s administration. They are obviously bound and deter-mined to impede the President from making appointments, and they are willing to go to increasingly absurd lengths to further that goal—like re-quiring 30 hours of debate time on a noncontroversial nominee after having just voted unanimously that debate on the nomination was unnecessary. If our Democratic colleagues keep up this current rate of obstruction, only allowing about one confirmation every 3
1⁄2days, it will take the Senate almost 11
1⁄2years to confirm the remaining Presidential appointments that must come before us. I will say that again. At this rate, it would take us nearly 111⁄2years to con-firm the remaining Presidential ap-pointments. That is why I say to my friends across the aisle, this near total obstruction simply cannot continue. As the Democratic leader once said himself, ‘‘Who in America doesn’t think a president, Democrat or Repub-lican, deserves his or her picks for who should run the agencies? Nobody.’’ That is a direct quote from the Demo-cratic leader. He went on. He said: ‘‘The American people deserve a functioning govern-ment, not gridlock.’’ So I would again ask my friend the Democratic leader and his party to consider the consequences of their ac-tions and chart a different path. That is the best outcome for the country and for the Senate. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized. 
f 
HEALTHCARE LEGISLATION Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, yesterday my friend the majority lead-er announced he would be extending this work period by 2 weeks so the Re-publicans can have more time to finish their healthcare bill. With all due re-spect, time is not the issue. Two more weeks will not help Republicans fix this bill. Remember, the Republican leadership told everyone they would vote on the bill before July 4. Two weeks have gone by, and they don’t seem any closer to having a bill that would actually improve healthcare in America. They seem even further away. When you have a rotten product, time is not on your side. The longer you wait, the more people know about it, the fewer people like it, the less popular it is, and the harder it is to pass it. I don’t even have to tell my good friend the leader that. He knows it. I know why our colleagues are not so unhappy about what the leader said. We know why our Republican col-leagues don’t want to go home. They don’t want to face the wrath of their constituents. If I were a Republican, I wouldn’t want to go home either. I wouldn’t want to face my constituents and try to defend this deeply unpopular and damaging bill. Now, the most significant change proposed to their legislation over the course of 2 weeks is an amendment by the junior Senator from Texas that would actually make the bill worse. By allowing insurers to sell cutrate plans that cover very few services, the Cruz amendment creates a very dangerous bait and switch. The bait is that the premiums would come down for a bit for some because insurance will not have to cover very much, and the switch is that deductibles and copays go way up to make up even more than the difference. Under the Cruz amend-ment, you could be paying a monthly premium for a healthcare insurance plan so threadbare, with a deductible so high that you will not get any ben-efit. For many, a Cruz policy could be worse than none at all. The Cruz policy leads to junk insurance, something no-body really wants, except maybe a few insurance companies. Ironically, the Cruz amendment would cause exactly the kind of death spiral my Republican friends keep talking about. A group of patient advo-cates, including the AARP, the Cancer Action Network, and the American Heart Association—these are hardly political groups; these are patient ad-vocates—said that if the Cruz amend-ment passed, ‘‘younger and healthier individuals would be allowed to pur-chase non-ACA compliant plans that have lower premiums but fewer bene-fits.’’ Without the younger, healthier people in the risk pool, the premiums for ACA-compli-ant plans would rise quickly and signifi-cantly. This same kind of risk pool seg-mentation occurred prior to the enactment of the ACA when 35 states operated high-risk pools . . . In that experience, most of those states . . . were forced to limit enrollment, reduce benefits, create waiting lists, and raise premiums and out-of-pocket costs to the point of unaffordability. Millions of pa-tients lacked access to care and treatment. 
That is not C HUCK SCHUMER , the mi-nority leader, talking. That is the AARP, the Cancer Action Network, and the American Heart Association. Again, those groups said about the Cruz plan that it would ‘‘limit enroll-ment, reduce benefits, create waiting lists, and raise premiums and out-of- pocket costs to the point of unaffordability,’’ because the Cruz plan is very similar to what we had before the ACA. Even the conservative Amer-ican Action Forum said the Cruz amendment is ‘‘the definition of a death spiral.’’ Higher costs, less care, waiting lists, death spirals—that is the Cruz amendment in a nutshell. How many are going to vote for that? That is the most significant change Republicans came up with after an extra 2 weeks on the bill. Imagine, if they have another 2 weeks, what they will come up with. My friends on the other side of the aisle should have no illusions. They can’t distract our attention from this bill by phony complaints over nomina-tions or any other issue. More time is not going to solve their problem on healthcare. It is much deeper than that. The problem is the substance of

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S3935 July 12, 2017 
the bill, which so cruelly exchanges healthcare for working Americans for a massive tax cut for the very wealthy. The idea is so backward that the American people have revolted against this legislation. Even in the deeply conservative parts of my State, where I have met with my constituents, there is a revulsion to this bill. I am not sur-prised that some polls say that only 12 percent of Americans support it. There is no fixing a bill as broken as this one. There is no tweaking a bill as fundamentally flawed as this one. An amended bill that only kicks 15 or 17 or 20 million Americans off their insur-ance, though less than the last CBO es-timate, would still be a moral travesty. An amended bill that gives a slightly smaller tax break to the wealthy while still cutting Medicaid to the bone would still be gravely worse than the status quo. The only answer for my Re-publican friends is simple: Start over. Abandon cuts to Medicaid, abandon tax breaks for the wealthy, and abandon this one-party approach. Democrats want to work with our Republican colleagues to actually im-prove our healthcare system, and, it turns out, that is what the American people want as well. The Kaiser Family Foundation found that 71 percent of Americans favor a bi-partisan effort to improve our healthcare system, as opposed to the Republican’s partisan effort. That is, again, that 71 percent favor a bipar-tisan effort—72 percent of Independents and even 46 percent of Trump sup-porters. When will my Republican colleagues start listening to the American people? Start over, drop this partisan process and this devastating bill, and work with us. We are willing to stay 2 weeks, 2 months, or 2 years to get a good healthcare bill for the American peo-ple, but we should be included in the process. 
f 
NET NEUTRALITY Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, today is the net neutrality day of ac-tion. So I wanted to add a few words to this issue. We depend on a free and open inter-net to spur innovation and job cre-ation, and our economy works best when innovators, entrepreneurs, and businesses of all sizes compete on a level playing field. Net neutrality, very simply, says that everyone—con-sumers, small businesses, startups—de-serve the same access to and quality of internet as big corporations. When I was growing up in Brooklyn, my father owned a small exterminating business. If his competitor down the street had received preferred elec-tricity service, he would have been rightly outraged, and the law would have protected him from that unfair treatment. We don’t reserve certain highways for a single trucking com-pany, and we don’t limit phone service to hand-picked stores. We shouldn’t re-serve high-speed internet for a favored few corporations, either, and that was the basis of the FCC’s decision to pre-serve net neutrality back in 2015. Now, of course, conservative and in-dustry interests see an opportunity to roll back these protections and free ac-cess to a free and open internet in order to favor powerful corporations. That seems to be what they want. President Trump’s appointee to the FCC, Chairman Ajit Pai, has already taken several actions to undercut fair internet access. In his first 2 weeks on the job, Chairman Pai stopped nine companies from providing discounted high-speed internet to low-income indi-viduals, and he jammed through nearly a dozen industry-backed actions, in-cluding some to begin curtailing net neutrality. Once again, this administration fa-vors the big, wealthy, special corporate interests over the average American. The American people should realize that is what the Trump administration is doing time and again. They talk like they are for working people, but when it comes to actions like this one on net neutrality, they favor the big special interests that, Mr. and Mrs. American Consumer, are going to make sure that in many instances you pay more. It is another example of the Trump admin-istration sticking up for big corpora-tions and special interests to the det-riment of the people and small busi-nesses—exactly the opposite of what President Trump promised in his cam-paign. The Open Internet Order is working well, and it should remain undisturbed. If President Trump and Chairman Pai proceed down the path of dismantling net neutrality, they can expect a wall of resistance from Senate Democrats. We will fight tooth and nail to protect fair and equal internet access for all Americans. President Trump, our Re-publican colleagues, and Chairman Pai can expect a wall of resistance from the American people, as well, who are already making their voices heard in record numbers. So far, over 6 mil-lion—6 million—Americans have sent comments to the FCC on this issue. The fight has just begun, and we will not let up until the FCC abandons its wrong-headed plans. I yield the floor.

Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about what I saw happen over the Fourth of July in Wyoming while visiting with people, visiting with patients, doctors, and nurses. What I am seeing is that the pain of ObamaCare continues to worsen. The healthcare crisis we are seeing across this country continues to grow. The crisis is rising, the choices are disappearing, and the American people are desperate for Congress to step in and do something to help rescue them from the rising costs and col-lapsing choices of the Obama healthcare law. It is interesting. When the Demo-crats passed ObamaCare, the Demo-cratic leader at the time, Harry Reid, said that we would all get an ‘‘earful of wonderment and happiness.’’ Those were his words about how great the law was. Well, every weekend at home in Wyoming and I am sure in the Pre-siding Officer’s State of North Caro-lina, we get an earful, too, and it is not about wonderment and happiness over ObamaCare. What I hear from patients, doctors, and nurses at home is that ObamaCare is hurting them, hurting our communities, hurting our State. I hear about the rise in premiums. I hear about the declining number of options, the collapse of ObamaCare. We have one choice in Wyoming. We used to have two. Both lost money in spite of very high premiums. What we saw is that one ended up going out of busi-ness, and the one we have in business— the only one we have—is still losing money. We are fortunate because we have at least one provider providing coverage. There are now 40 counties across Amer-ica where no one will be selling ObamaCare insurance next year—no one, not a single company will be sell-ing ObamaCare insurance. In Nevada, where prior Senator Harry Reid is from, only three counties are going to have anyone selling on the ObamaCare exchange—only three of the counties in the entire State, the State that Harry Reid represented in the Senate for many years. People liv-ing everywhere else in his home State will have I think one choice, maybe more, but in terms of these counties, no one is selling ObamaCare insurance at all. The State health insurance ex-change put out a statement in his home State that said that the people living in the rest of the State face what they described as a healthcare crisis. Democrats predicted wonderment and happiness about ObamaCare, but there is a healthcare crisis all across the country. People in that State are going to have no access to the insur-ance plans the Democrats promised them under ObamaCare. A lot of Amer-icans are not much better off or in bet-ter shape right now. There was a headline in the Inde-pendence Day edition of USA TODAY that said ‘‘1,370-plus counties have only one ACA insurer.’’ The article was about a study that was done by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. They found that people living in 1,300 counties have no choice when it comes to the ObamaCare plan; there is just one company offering the mandated coverage. Washington says you have to buy it; not many people want to sell it. Washington doesn’t seem to care. Democrats don’t seem to care about the fact that what they promised was a marketplace and what we have ended up with is a monopoly. Remember when Democrats promised there would be more competition? Essentially there is none. When there is none, we end up with less competition and generally with higher prices, which is what peo-ple across the country are seeing. Prices have essentially doubled in ObamaCare marketplaces over the last 4 years. That is why a lot of people are finding out that while they may still have access to coverage, it is so expen-sive, they can’t afford to buy it—be-cause they are down to one choice. Health insurance companies keep re-leasing information about how much higher they expect rates to go next year, which continues to be a problem. I have seen the headlines. ‘‘Another ObamaCare Rate Shock.’’ Look at what is happening in Ten-nessee. Earlier this year, Aetna and Humana both said they were dropping out of ObamaCare exchanges com-pletely. Cigna is one of the last big companies that are still willing to sell these plans. Well, they say they are going to have to raise premiums by 42 percent next year. Look at what is happening in Geor-gia, just across the border from Ten-nessee. Blue Cross Blue Shield is ask-ing for an average rate hike of 41 per-cent in Georgia. The Atlanta Journal- Constitution had an article about it just last week. They said Blue Cross might charge as much as 75 percent more for one plan next year. That is ObamaCare. Remember President Obama saying that if you like your plan, you can keep your plan? Those plans are gone. Remember President Obama saying that rates would drop by $2,500 a year for people? That is not what we saw. What we are seeing is what is con-tinuing today. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution is saying that Blue Cross Blue Shield may charge as much as 75 percent more next year. They quoted one man as saying: ‘‘That’s a breath taker.’’ An-other woman quoted in the article re-sponded to these price increases by saying simply ‘‘Yikes!’’ That is what people are facing all across the coun-try. I remember President Obama, leav-ing office, forcefully defending it and being proud. There is very little to be proud of here. People all across America are having the exact same reaction as they see how much their own insurance compa-nies are raising their rates all across the country. That is not the wonder-ment and happiness the Democrats said we would be hearing about when this was passed. The high prices are a big

reason so many people are dropping their insurance coverage. They can’t afford it. The people most likely to drop out, we find out, are, of course, the young people. Gallup came out with the results of a recent survey on Monday, just 2 days ago, with big headlines all across the country. What they found is that 2 mil-lion fewer Americans, under ObamaCare, have insurance today than they did at the end of last year, just 6 months ago. There have been 2 million fewer over the last 6 months. So, in just 6 months, 2 million people have gone off insurance. Most of them are young, and according to the survey by Gallup, they basically say they dropped it because it was just too ex-pensive. They do not feel that they are getting value for their money. These 2 million people are not talking about the wonderment and happiness of ObamaCare. They are just leaving it behind. Democrats said people would love ObamaCare. They said ObamaCare would bring down prices. It has not. They said it would increase competi-tion, but they did not get that one right either. None of this is happening. Now the Democrats are starting to say that having Washington-mandated health insurance is not enough. They say we need health insurance to be run entirely by Washington. Apparently, they did not learn the lesson that said that the Washington-mandated insur-ance—having to buy a Washington product—would be good enough. Now they are recognizing that it is not good enough. They are saying that we need Washington in charge of all of it. They call it single-payer healthcare, but let’s talk about what it is. It is government-controlled healthcare— government-mandated, government- controlled, government-run, one-size- fits-all healthcare. It is a single payer, with the American taxpayers paying the bill. We see what happened in California when its legislature passed a similar thing in the State senate. They asked: What is the cost? $400 billion. What is the budget of the entire State of Cali-fornia? $190 billion. So what they pro-posed in the State senate has passed in the State of California and costs twice what the entire budget is in the State of California. To give what the people of California have been promised by the State senate, they are going to have to raise taxes on people, and then you will get the rationing of care and the lines and the waiting time. It is what happens around the world with government-mandated, government- run insurance. We see that in Canada, and we see that in England. I was practicing medicine prior to coming here to the Senate. I was an or-thopedic surgeon in Wyoming. I knew we needed to do healthcare reform, but ObamaCare was the very wrong reform. Democrats were wrong then, and all of the talk about government-run healthcare is wrong today—wrong today for the people of this country. Look, we understand that we need a better solution than ObamaCare. That is what I hear about every weekend in Wyoming. We need to put patients in charge, not the government. With the Democrats and the speeches they are giving and the bills that have been co-sponsored in the House by a majority of the Democrats, they want to put the government solely in charge of healthcare in this country. We need to have people at home mak-ing their own decisions, making their own choices, and not have Washington, DC, imposing its one-size-fits-all ap-proach. We need to give people options, not mandates. People deserve choices. That is what the American people want. That is what Democrats prom-ised years ago, but they never deliv-ered. That is what Republicans are committed to giving the American peo-ple today—doing it now so that pa-tients can get the healthcare they need from doctors whom they choose and at lower costs so that patients can make the decisions, not Washington. That is where we are today as we continue to debate and discuss healthcare in this country at this time. Just coming back from Wyoming, I visited with many folks—many former patients, a number of doctors whom I had worked with over the years, and nurses. I was at several hospitals. I just heard, unilaterally, across the State of Wyoming that ObamaCare continues to be a burden on the people of the State. They want freedom. They want choice. They want flexibility. They want to make decisions for themselves, not have Washington dictate to them and, certainly, not have government con-trolling healthcare in this country. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Connecticut. Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I have had the good fortune of being in both the House and the Senate during the period of passage and implementation of the Affordable Care Act and now the debate over repeal, and I have heard consistently from my Republican col-leagues two things. One is that they did not think the Affordable Care Act was the right approach to fixing the problems of America’s healthcare sys-tem. There were 60-some odd times that the House or the Senate voted to repeal all or parts of the Affordable Care Act. The second thing I heard con-sistently over that period of time, dat-ing from 2009, is that the Republicans were prepared to offer a replacement to the Affordable Care Act that would be better, that would be an improvement over the Affordable Care Act—indeed, over the status of the American healthcare system when the Affordable Care Act was passed. The ground has shifted mightily since then. The Congressional Budget Office tells us that, under the Republican plan ei-ther passed in the House or in the Sen-ate, a humanitarian catastrophe will result in this country. Tens of millions of people would lose their healthcare. That is not what Republicans said their replacement would do. They said their replacement would be better than the Affordable Care Act. The CBO says that rates will go up immediately by 20 percent on almost everybody. Then, after that, if you are young and healthy, rates will probably go down, but for everybody else, the amount of money you have to pay in premiums, copays, and deductibles will go up. There is nothing in the Repub-licans’ bill about cost—nothing that addresses the underlying issues with an American healthcare system that, pro-cedure by procedure, costs twice as much as in most other countries—and nothing about quality. There is not a single provision in the bill that encour-ages higher quality. As we get ready for Republican re-peal bill 3.0 or 4.0—whatever this next version will be that will be released se-cretly to Republicans tomorrow—I think it is just worth reminding every-body what Republicans said would hap-pen. I will just use our President’s words. I understand that many of my Republican colleagues here do not as-cribe to all of the beliefs and state-ments of our President, but he is the leader of the Republican Party. All of my colleagues did support him, and they stood with him in the House of Representatives, arm in arm, when they passed the Republican House’s re-peal and replacement bill. President Trump wrote this: 
I was the first and only potential GOP can-didate to state there will be no cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. Huckabee copied me. 
So no cuts to Medicaid was the prom-ise. Yet the bill that the President has endorsed and is trying to help Leader M
CCONNELL push through the Senate involves debilitating cuts to Med-icaid—$700 billion to $800 billion worth of cuts to Medicaid—resulting in mil-lions of people being pushed off of that benefit. The cut to the State of Con-necticut would be $3 billion. We are a tiny State. Our Medicaid Program is somewhere in the neighborhood of $8 billion. We would lose $3 billion of that. The promise was that we would not cut Medicaid. This bill cuts Medicaid. President Trump wrote: 
If our healthcare plan is approved, you will see real healthcare, and premiums will start tumbling down. ObamaCare is in a death spi-ral! 
There is always one long sentence and then one very short sentence. Here are the two claims: ‘‘Premiums will start tumbling down.’’ That has been the promise, and that has been a consistent promise—that costs will go down if the Affordable Care Act is re-pealed and replaced with a Republican plan. The CBO debunks this from be-ginning to end. It says that premiums will go up. They will start tumbling upwards immediately at rates of 20 per-cent. If you are older or if you have any history of preexisting conditions, your premiums will continue to go up. The danger, of course, is in thinking

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES3938 July 12, 2017 
that the only thing that you pay in the healthcare system is premiums. I could pretty easily construct a healthcare re-form proposal in which your premium would go dramatically down. How would I do that? I would just shift all of the payments onto deductibles, onto copays, and I would give you nothing with regard to the actuarial benefit of the plan. It is easy to get premiums to go down if you do not care about what you are actually covering and the size of your deductibles and the size of your copays. Then, ‘‘ObamaCare is in a death spi-ral!’’ The CBO debunks that as well. The CBO says that, if you leave the Af-fordable Care Act in place over the course of the next 10 years, 2 or 3 mil-lion people will lose healthcare insur-ance. If you pass the Republicans’ healthcare bill, that is where the death spiral occurs. There are 23 million peo-ple who will lose insurance if you pass the Republicans’ bill, but 2 to 3 million people will lose insurance if you do not pass it. Again, President Trump writes: 
Healthcare plan is on its way. Will have much lower premiums and deductibles— 
Here, he is making a commitment on deductibles. Once again, the Congres-sional Budget Office says that pre-miums will go up and deductibles will go up, especially for individuals who are older or individuals with pre-existing conditions— 
while at the same time taking care of pre-ex-isting conditions! 
This bill does not take care of people with preexisting conditions. Why? Be-cause it allows for any State to allow insurance companies to get out from the minimum benefits requirement. If you have cancer, technically, the Sen-ate Republicans’ bill says that you can-not be charged more, but you may not be able to find a plan that covers can-cer treatments. So that is not pro-tecting people with preexisting condi-tions. The CBO says this specifically. It says that, especially for people with preexisting mental illness and pre-existing addiction, they will be priced out of the marketplace because they will not find plans that cover their ill-nesses. You cannot just protect people with preexisting conditions by saying that insurance plans have to cover them. You actually have to require in-surance plans to offer the medical ben-efit they need. Once again: 
Our healthcare plan will lower premiums and deductibles—and be great healthcare! Insurance companies are fleeing ObamaCare—it is dead. 
I have already covered the part about premiums and deductibles, but let’s re-member that insurance companies were not fleeing ObamaCare until President Trump was sworn into office. The pe-riod of open enrollment covered a pe-riod prior to his inauguration and a pe-riod after his inauguration. Before President Trump’s inauguration, open enrollment was on pace to enroll a record number of Americans in ex-change plans and Medicaid plans— record enrollment. Enrollment fell off a cliff after President Trump was sworn into office and signed an Execu-tive order that told all of his agencies to unwind the Affordable Care Act. People listened to President Trump, who said that he was going to kill the Affordable Care Act, and they stopped signing up for those plans. It got worse when he refused to pay insurance companies. Right now, the President will not commit to paying cost-sharing subsidies to insurance companies more than 30 days ahead of time. He stopped enforcing the indi-vidual mandate, and it is no surprise that insurance companies are saying they do not want to participate in these exchanges because the President is trying to kill them. He has made it very clear from day one. I have had the benefit of being on the floor a number of times with Senator BARRASSO , who often came down to the floor, following my remarks, during the period of the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. I heard him talk about the fact that there will be freedom for Americans to have or not to have insurance if this piece of legis-lation is passed. It is a wonderful idea that people will be free to not be able to afford insurance. The reality is that, yes, some individuals buy insurance today because they are compelled to by the individual mandate, but there is a reason for that. If you do not compel people to buy insurance who are healthy, then you cannot protect peo-ple who are sick. I sat where the Presiding Officer is during Senator C
RUZ’s 24-hour fili-buster. In the middle of that filibuster, he said exactly that. Senator C
RUZ, in the middle of the his filibuster, said that we all understand that you have to have the individual mandate in order to prohibit companies from charging higher premiums for people who are sick, and my Republican col-leagues know that because they kept the individual mandate in their bill. So this nonsense about no one’s being required to buy insurance is belied by the text of the legislation we are con-sidering. There is a mandate in this bill. There is a penalty in this bill. It is just a far meaner and crueler penalty than was included in the Affordable Care Act. What do I mean by that? So the Affordable Care Act doesn’t mandate that you buy insurance in the sense that if you don’t buy it, you will be locked up in jail; it says that if you don’t buy insurance, you will pay a penalty on your income tax. If you don’t buy insurance, there will be a penalty. That is exactly what the Republican Senate bill says. It says that if you don’t buy insurance, you will incur a penalty. In their bill, the penalty is that you will be locked out of buying insurance for 6 months. If you are sick, or even, frankly, if you are healthy and you need to go see a doctor for some-thing, you will have to pay for that out of your pocket for those 6 months. If you are sick, and you have a serious condition and you are legally refused healthcare because of this legislation, the consequences could be dire, but whatever the scope of the con-sequences, it is still a penalty, just like there was a penalty in the bill that the Democrats supported and passed in 2009 and 2010. So it is just not true to say that now Americans have the freedom not to have healthcare. You don’t because you are going to be penalized if you let your health insurance lapse. If you don’t make payments for a couple months, you are locked out of the in-surance market. That is just a dif-ferent kind of penalty than the one that is in our bill. The truth is that while I admit there are some people who buy insurance today because they fear that penalty, it is necessary, as Republicans realize, in order to make sure the markets don’t spiral out of control, because if you say that you can’t charge people with preexisting conditions more and you don’t require healthy people to buy insurance, then why would any healthy person buy insurance? They will just wait until they are sick because they know that once they are sick and need very expensive care, they can’t be charged any more for it. The nature of insurance is that peo-ple who have the good fortune to be healthy or to be free of accident or nat-ural disaster subsidize individuals who are not so fortunate—who are sick, who do have an accident occur to their home or who are subject to a natural disaster. That is how insurance works. Republicans realize that because they put a penalty in their bill, but for as many people who buy insurance be-cause they are forced to, most people buy insurance because they want it be-cause they recognize it is better to have insurance in the case that they or a loved one gets sick, and that is whom we are talking about here. Of the 23 million who lose insurance, according to CBO, under the Republican bill, mil-lions and millions of those are those people who want insurance but will not be able to get it because they are priced out by the Republican bill. I can see there will be some people who will make that choice, but there will be millions more who had insurance today who will not be able to get it moving forward. As Republicans finish up this latest round of secret negotiations, I just want to make sure we are on the same page about what this bill does. It man-dates that you buy insurance, just in a different way. It has a penalty just like the Affordable Care Act has a penalty. I want to make sure we remember what Republicans stated as their goals for this replacement. The goals were that the system would be better, but by every single metric, this proposal will result in worse healthcare for people. Less people will have insurance. Rates

will go up for everyone except for young, healthy people. Costs will con-tinue to spiral out of control, and no additional measures will be taken to make quality better. Every single prob-lem that Republicans address in the ex-isting healthcare system gets worse. Senator B
ARRASSO complains merci-lessly about these exchanges. CBO says the exchanges will shed even more peo-ple. The costs will go even higher. Sen-ator C
ORNYN regularly tweets out that the Affordable Care Act still left 28 million people uninsured, but this bill you are debating will double the num-ber of people who don’t have insurance. For all of my Republican colleagues who rightly come to the floor and talk about the fact that the cost is too high for individuals in our system, there is not a single provision in this bill that deals with the actual cost of the serv-ice, of the procedure, of the visit, of the surgery. I am deeply worried that this next version of the Republican repeal and replace bill will result in premiums going up by 15 percent and only 17 mil-lion Americans losing healthcare and it will be declared a victory, but that is not what Republicans promised. They promised to repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it with something that is better, not something that is less bad than the original version of the re-placement plan they introduced. I think the reason that to many peo-ple it appears this bill is falling apart is because when my colleagues went home this weekend, they heard an ear-ful from their constituents—from real folks who will be affected by this piece of legislation. Alison is 28 years old. She is from Milford, CT. She was in my office this week. She came to DC this week, she and her boyfriend, I think—I don’t want to ascribe an engagement to them that is not true; I think her boyfriend. They came down here this week. They were supposed to be on vacation this week, and they decided to spend some of their vacation coming to Wash-ington so Alison could tell her story to Members of Congress. When she was 9 years old, she was di-agnosed with a rare liver disease. At the time, she and her family were told that they would need to find a liver transplant in roughly 10 years or she wouldn’t survive. At the start of her sophomore year at Sacred Heart University in Con-necticut, she was starting to have symptoms of a condition that results from a buildup of ammonia in her brain. She was having a hard time con-centrating, abdominal pain, nose bleeds, nausea, vomiting, and joint pain. Her doctor said it was time for her to get that transplant, that she was at that critical moment when she need-ed it. Unfortunately, none of her family or 8 other candidates—friends, I think, of the family—were a match. So in des-peration, her parents wrote an email and just sent it out to people who lived in Trumbull and in the Sacred Heart University community. From that email, an anonymous young man stepped forward. He was tested and de-termined to be a match. The surgery was a success. When she walked on stage to receive her diploma from Sa-cred Heart University, she was joined by that anonymous donor, and her fel-low graduates gave her a standing ova-tion. Now, her family was lucky because she had insurance through her father. She is, because of the Affordable Care Act, allowed to do that, at the time being under 26 years old. Her insurance paid for virtually everything that was necessary, but, she says, had my dad not had the healthcare benefits he did, I know my family would not be in the place we are today because my parents would have lost everything they worked so hard for. There was no way we could have afforded to pay for all of those burdens. Today she worries that if this bill is passed, she, as a young woman with a preexisting condition, will be destined to a life of discrimination because she may not be able to find a plan that cov-ers her condition because of the with-drawal of protection with respect to the minimum benefits requirements. Even in Connecticut, she is vulnerable to that withdrawal of protection, not because Connecticut is likely to allow insurance plans to offer coverage that doesn’t include the minimum benefits but because if you work for a big com-pany, and even if you are housed in Connecticut, if that company anchors their plan in a State that does strip away the insurance protections, then you lose the protections even as a resi-dent of Connecticut. Alison is now a nurse in the neonatal intensive care unit at Yale University Children’s Hospital. She is contrib-uting in a big way to our State and to the healthcare system. Yet she is liv-ing in fear of this legislation being passed. So she took some of her vaca-tion to come to Washington to share her story with us. I am with Senator C
OLLINS . I think the Republicans should scrap this gar-bage piece of legislation. I hope they understand our offer is sincere—it is not political—that Democrats do want to sit down with Republicans and try to provide some reasonable fix to what still ails our healthcare system. I will end with this thought: It doesn’t have to be like this. Healthcare does not have to be a political football that is just tossed from one side to the other every 10 years. That is what has been happening here for my entire po-litical lifetime. I was elected to Con-gress in 2006, in part because of the tempest of popular frustration with the way in which Republicans passed the 2003 Medicare Modernization Act, which included the new prescription drug benefit that Democrats saw—and sold—as a giveaway to the drug and in-surance industries. Democrats used healthcare as a political cudgel to bludgeon Republicans after the 2003 Medicare Modernization Act. Its imple-mentation was very rocky, just as the implementation of the Affordable Care Act was. The Democrats used it against Republicans. In 2009, it was the Republicans’ turn to bludgeon Democrats. Democrats lost a lot of seats in 2010, in part because Republicans used the passage of the Af-fordable Care Act to politically harm Democrats. Now, once again, it is the Democrats’ turn to politically bludg-eon Republicans. Whether this bill passes or not, the fact that Republicans have walked out on a plank with a partisan piece of leg-islation that takes insurance from 23 million people across the country and, as every poll shows, is widely unpopu-lar will be a political liability for Re-publicans. What if we decided to stop tossing healthcare back and forth? What if we decided to jointly own one-fifth of our economy? What if we decided to sit down and give a little bit, from our side to yours, from your side to ours? What if I said that I understood you cared about flexibility in these mar-ketplaces, that I understood your de-sire for more flexibility for Governors and State legislatures under Medicaid? What if you said you understood our interest in providing long-term sta-bility in these marketplaces, that you understood our desire to try to get at some of the costs of the actual services and devices and prescription drugs that are sold? What if we sat down and fixed the things that aren’t working, kept the things that are working, and held hands together and said that we are going to jointly own the American healthcare system? It would leave plenty of things to fight over. There would still be no shortage of disagreements that we could run elections on. Whether it be immigration or taxes or minimum wage, there will still be lots of things we could disagree on, but for as long as I have been in politics, this issue has just been thrown back and forth, to hurt Democrats, to hurt Republicans. In the process, we have injected so much uncertainty into the healthcare system and into the economy at large, that we make it impossible for private sector reform to take hold. Hospitals and healthcare providers have been doing really innovative things since the Affordable Care Act went into effect because they got a sig-nal from the Federal Government that we wanted them to start building big coordinated systems of care, that we were going to reward outcomes rather than volume. So they started making all of these big changes, and then, about a year ago, they stopped because Republicans said they were going to blow up that model and pass something new. We frustrated innovation because we telegraphed that healthcare policy is just going to ping-pong back and forth between left and right. We hurt ourselves politically, we frustrate the

private sector innovation, and get no benefit to us on the economy. My offer, and I think the offer from most of my colleagues, is sincere. If my Republican friends do choose to throw away this piece of legislation because it doesn’t comport with the goals that Republicans have long said were at the heart of their effort to repeal this bill, there is an important bipartisan con-versation about keeping what is work-ing in our healthcare system and ad-mitting together that there are big things that aren’t working and fixing them together. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. C
OT-
TON). Without objection, it is so or-dered. Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, the most important three words in our Constitution are the first three words: ‘‘We the People.’’ Our Founders chose to write those words in supersized font so that we could, from some distance away, know exactly what the mission statement was. Their goal wasn’t to write a struc-ture for government that would repeat the governments of, by, and for the powerful of Europe but to pursue dif-ferently a vision in which the will of the people would be enacted; that gov-ernment would work not just for the benefit of the citizens at large but also empowered by the citizens at large. This is a vision we have been very con-cerned about as we see the influence of the concentration of money in Amer-ican politics. Indeed, we have five members of the Supreme Court who don’t understand the basic, fundamental nature of the first three words of our Constitution. They adopted a court case, Citizens United, which was the opposite of the vision of our Constitution. That vision was articulated by Thomas Jefferson, who said that the will of the people will be enacted only if each and every citizen has an equal voice. But Citizens United gives a dramatic, stadium-sized megaphone to the individuals who are the richest and most powerful in the country, at odds with that funda-mental vision that Lincoln so well summarized as government of, by, and for the people. We have certainly seen the case of government by and for the powerful in the context of the recent TrumpCare bill—the Senate version thereof—craft-ed in secret by 13 of my colleagues from across the aisle, hiding from the press, hiding from the healthcare stakeholders and experts, hiding from their own citizens. In fact, during this last break, of the 52 Members of the Republican caucus, apparently—report-edly—only a couple had townhalls be-cause they were terrified of what their citizens would say about the bill they have been crafting in secret—the secret 13. This bill is also known as the zero, zero, zero bill—zero committee meet-ings, zero amendments considered in committee, zero months of opportunity for Senators to go back and consult with their citizens back in their home States. Then what do we find as a result of this secret process of government by and for the powerful? A bill to rip healthcare from 22 million Americans in order to deliver hundreds of billions of dollars to the richest Americans. In fact, if you want to summarize it, you can say that this bill gives $33 billion— not $33,000, not $33 million but $33 bil-lion—to the richest 400 Americans while ripping healthcare away from 700,000. That is the number who could be funded by that same $33 billion. That would cover all of the Medicaid recipients in Alaska and Arkansas and West Virginia and Nevada. This has in-credibly grave consequences for the peace of mind and the quality of life for these millions of Americans. It rips $772 billion out of Medicaid. We know the Medicaid expansion in Oregon has enabled 400,000 people to ac-quire healthcare in my home State— 400,000. If they were holding hands, they would stretch from the Pacific Ocean to the State of Idaho, across the entire east-west breadth of my State. Think about how much of an impact this has on rural Americans. One out of three Oregonians in rural Oregon are on the Oregon Health Plan, Oregon’s Medicaid Program. It has a big impact on our seniors—our seniors in long- term care. Oregon is a leader in helping fami-lies, helping individuals stay in their homes as their healthcare deteriorates. But when they can no longer stay in their home because of the extensive na-ture of their care, many then are, through Medicaid, able to go and get care—long-term care—in a nursing home. That long-term care, paid for by the Oregon Health Plan, covers about 60 percent of the individuals in long- term care, but in rural Oregon, it is much higher. I was in Klamath Falls at a nursing home. I was citing the national sta-tistic, 60 percent, and the head of the nursing home said: Senator, here, it is virtually 100 percent. I looked at those residents down that long hallway who needed intensive nursing healthcare, and one woman asked why I was there. Her name was Deborah. When I explained it, she said: I am paid for by Medicaid. If Medicaid goes away, I am out on the street. That is a problem because I can’t walk. It is not just a problem for Deborah. It is a problem for all of our residents in long-term care who need extensive nursing care. It is a challenge. It is a real challenge. It is a real problem for our mothers. One out of three women in maternity care are paid for by Med-icaid. Don’t we want our children to get a good, strong start in life? Don’t we want maternity care from the mo-ment a woman knows she is expecting a child? Don’t we want that? Then why do so many of my colleagues support a bill to tear that care away from our ex-pecting mothers? It is a problem for our older Ameri-cans, our older Americans whose rates would go way up. For example, a man who is 60 years old, earning $20,000 a year, who currently pays about $80 a month for healthcare—an affordable policy. Under the Republican TrumpCare bill, that would go to $570 a month. I challenge my colleagues, find me someone earning $20,000 a year who can pay $570 a month for healthcare. Find that individual and defend your plan on the floor of the Senate as to why that isn’t equivalent to just taking healthcare away from that individual. Then, of course, we have the issue of preexisting conditions. People some-times have an injury in high school football or maybe it is in softball or gymnastics or in wrestling that they carry with them their entire lives. Maybe it is something that develops further on in life. Maybe it is asthma, diabetes, or an episode of cancer. Now they have a preexisting condition. Under our old healthcare system, prior to 2009, 2010, they couldn’t acquire in-surance unless they were fortunate enough to get it through that job, which millions of Americans do not get it through their workplace. They were out in the cold, out on the ice. Now we have this Republican TrumpCare bill. They want to throw those citizens back on the ice who have preexisting conditions, not their friends who are wealthy enough to buy healthcare on their own or heads of corporations who get big benefit pack-ages—not them, no, just the struggling working Americans. Don’t we care about struggling work-ing Americans? Aren’t we a ‘‘we the people’’ nation, not a ‘‘we the privi-leged’’ nation? I encourage my col-leagues to read up on the first three words of our Constitution and what it means. Then we have the plan my colleague from Texas has presented. It is referred to as the Cruz amendment. The Cruz amendment—the Cruz amendment for fake insurance. It works like this. It says, if an insurance company provides one policy with extensive benefits— that is, benefits essential to ordinary healthcare like maternity care and the ability to go to a hospital, the ability to get a broken bone repaired, the abil-ity to get affordable drugs, just the ba-sics of healthcare—they have one pol-icy with these essential benefits. They can offer policies that cover virtually nothing. These are known as fake in-surance. We have a President who likes to talk about fake news virtually every day. Why do we have a President who

hates fake news but loves fake insur-ance? Why do I have 52 colleagues here who apparently love fake insurance? Here is what it does. It means the young and the healthy get those poli-cies because they cost very little, and they make a bet that they aren’t going to get hurt and they are not going to get sick. That means that those who are older and those who have pre-existing conditions have to go for the policy that has those essential bene-fits, but now because only the older in-dividuals and the sicker individuals are getting that policy, it is way beyond reach. Earlier I described how a 60-year-old at $20,000 has a policy that increases seven times, from $80 a month to $570 a month. The Cruz amendment would make that much worse. It makes fake insurance for the young or the wealthy and unaffordable policies for those who are older and have preexisting condi-tions. Our President said the House bill is mean, but the Senate bill is meaner. The House bill would knock 14 million people out of healthcare within a single year. The Senate bill, that is 15 million people. The American Medical Association has long operated under the precept of, first, do no harm. Wouldn’t that be a good principle for legislation on healthcare? Is it any wonder that the USA TODAY poll says only one out of eight Americans likes this Republican TrumpCare bill. We can turn to the PBS NewsHour poll, 17 percent. That is quite a small number of Americans who understand that ripping healthcare from 22 million people in order to give hundreds of billions of dollars to the richest Americans is one of the biggest takings this country has ever seen proposed and one that so deeply and profoundly damages the quality of life for these Americans. Our Presidents—Republican and Democratic—over time have under-stood this. President Eisenhower said: 
Because the strength of our nation is in its people, their good health is a proper national concern; healthy Americans live more re-warding, more productive and happier lives. 
He continued: 
Fortunately, the nation continues its ad-vance in bettering the health of all its peo-ple. 
Today, on the floor of the Senate, we have a different philosophy, not the Ei-senhower strategy of advancing the bettering of the health of all of our people but in fact the Trump policy echoed by so many of my colleagues that is about destroying the healthcare for millions of people, taking us back in time to a place where peace of mind was missing for millions of Americans because they couldn’t either afford healthcare or because their policies didn’t cover anything. Other Presi-dents over time have weighed in with very similar sentiments to that which President Eisenhower put forward. Let’s hear it from the citizens back home. Kathryn, from Springfield, has battled cancer three times over the last 12 years. Kathryn says that during her last two bouts with cancer, in 2010 and 2011, she was ‘‘blessed enough to have qualified for the Oregon Health Plan’’ and that without it she would not be here today. Indeed, healthcare coverage has been a blessing to so many. Let’s not rip those blessings away. Let’s go to Beth in Bend and her 34- year-old son who is living with a rare genetic condition and relies on the Or-egon Health Plan to survive. In 2012, doctors found tumors along his spine and areas of concern in his brain and his lungs. They are benign now but could turn into cancer at any time. Beth’s son’s life depends on regular, ex-pensive MRIs to monitor them. He is only able to afford those MRIs because of the Oregon health plan. As Beth says, ‘‘If the ACA is repealed and replaced with TrumpCare, my son will most likely lose his current health insurance . . . the loss of access to af-fordable insurance is a potential death sentence for my son.’’ Medical professionals like Caitlin, a nurse in Portland, tell us how signifi-cant this is, and she writes: With the passage of ObamaCare, I saw peo-ple were finally able to come and be seen by our medical teams. Often their disease proc-esses were so advanced that we would have to take very extreme measures to try to halt or reverse these disease processes. But as time has passed, we’re able to catch things sooner and people can actually go to primary care rather than waiting until it’s a matter of life or death and having to be seen in the Emergency Department. 
I am struck by Liz from Enterprise, who works at a clinic and told me that the clinic has expanded in this very small, remote town in Northeast Or-egon from 20-something employees to 50-something employees. It has doubled in size, which means an incredible im-provement in healthcare. She went on to say that they have been able to take on mental health as well, which they never were able to do before. Why could they afford to do this? Because the un-compensated care dropped so dramati-cally that their finances improved, and they were able to hire more staff. Let’s ask about John in Sherwood. John wrote about his grandmother. He lost his grandmother to Alzheimer’s a few months ago, but thanks to the Or-egon Health Plan, his grandmother was able to live in a nursing home and get the care she needed 24 hours a day right up until the end. As John says, ‘‘I’m forever thankful for the work of President Obama and Congress for passing the ACA. If they wouldn’t have passed this bill, my grandmother wouldn’t have gotten the care she needed from those great men and women at the nursing home.’’ These stories go on forever. Over this last weekend, I did a series of town-halls in rural Oregon, parts of Oregon that would be painted red on a political map. I held those townhalls and then went to a series of other Main Street walks with mayors and small incor-porated cities. What I heard every-where I went—inviting the entire com-munity to come to the townhall and talk—was enormous anxiety, enormous anxiety and disappointment that the leaders they are counting on here to make our healthcare system work bet-ter care more about giving more Amer-ican tax dollars away to the richest Americans than they do about funda-mental healthcare for struggling work-ing families across our Nation. Let’s listen to those individuals. I know most of my colleagues didn’t go home and listen to their constituents. As I mentioned, it has been reported that only a couple of my Republican colleagues held a townhall, even though this bill would affect them so profoundly. Still, their voices are echo-ing through this building, through the emails, through the phone calls, through the individuals who are com-ing and visiting our offices both here and back home. Let’s listen to those voices. Let’s be a ‘‘we the people’’ na-tion that works in partnership with the American people to make this world, this Nation, provide a foundation for every family to thrive. That means we have to take an oak stick and pound it through the heart of TrumpCare and bury it 6 feet under and then work together in a bipartisan fashion. Think of all we could do. We know that when you strip away rein-surance, you destroy the market for in-surance companies to go into new areas and compete. Let’s restore that rein-surance. We know that when the President holds on to the cost-share payments and will not say whether he is releas-ing them, our companies don’t know how to price their policies, and they are dropping out of the exchanges across this Nation. County after coun-ty health insurance companies are flee-ing because the President will not tell them whether he is releasing these cost-share payments. We can fix that. We know we have a meth and opioid epidemic across this country. I have heard my colleagues on both sides say we have to take this on in a more cou-rageous, more substantial fashion. We passed authorizing legislation, but let’s put funds behind that. Let’s do that, and let’s take on the high cost of phar-maceuticals. These four things we can do together. The country would love to see Demo-crats and Republicans working to-gether to make our healthcare system work better. That is exactly what we should be doing in representing the citizens of the United States of Amer-ica in a ‘‘we the people’’ democratic re-public. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Utah. 
TAX REFORM  
Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to once again discuss the ongoing effort to reform our Nation’s Tax Code. Over the past several years, I have come to the floor often to make the case for tax reform by highlighting the many short-comings of our current tax system and

discussing the benefits we could reap by making the necessary changes. Over the last years while I have been serving as chairman or the lead Repub-lican on the Senate tax-writing com-mittee—both as ranking member and as chairman—I have made tax reform my top priority, and right now, I be-lieve there is more momentum in favor of tax reform than we have seen in dec-ades. To capitalize on that momentum, re-form advocates like myself need to continue to make the case for updating and fixing our broken tax system. To-ward that end, I intend to come to the floor often in the coming weeks and months to discuss various aspects of our tax system and make the case for reform. In my view, we need to go back to the drawing board and fundamen-tally rethink our entire tax system. This includes both the individual, as well as the business side of the tax ledger. Today, I want to talk specifically about our Nation’s business tax sys-tem, with a particular focus on the cor-porate tax. Let’s get the obvious out of the way first: The United States has the high-est statutory corporate tax rate in the industrialized world. Looking at the ef-fective corporate tax rates tells an equally gloomy story of the lack of American competitiveness. I will have more to say on that in a minute. I know some like to rail on corporate America and claim they aren’t paying their fair share, but the facts tell a dif-ferent story. Companies doing business in the United States are saddled with statuary tax rates that are higher than any other industrialized country. This isn’t just a Republican talking point; Members and commentators from both parties and across the ideological spec-trum have acknowledged that this is the problem. For example, just last year, former President Bill Clinton argued for a re-duction in corporate tax rates, noting that he had urged for the corporate tax to be raised to 35 percent when he was President because ‘‘it was precisely in the middle of OECD countries. It isn’t anymore.’’ Early in his Presidency, President Obama said: ‘‘Our current corporate tax system is outdated, unfair, and in-efficient.’’ He also said that our cor-porate tax system ‘‘hits companies that choose to stay in America with one of the highest tax rates in the world.’’ I might add, he did nothing about it, though. In addition, my counterpart on the Senate Finance Committee, Senator W
YDEN , has introduced legislation that would reduce corporate tax rates by more than 10 percent. In a Finance Committee report in 2015 on international tax reform, put out by a working group cochaired by my friends and colleagues Senators P
ORTMAN and S CHUMER , it was clearly stated that ‘‘no matter what jurisdic-tion a U.S. multinational company is competing in, it is at a competitive disadvantage.’’ There are plenty of other examples of prominent Democrats who recognized the impact of our obnoxiously high cor-porate tax rate. I want to turn back to Bill Clinton’s point, though, because it is an impor-tant one. We must always remember that businesses are, by and large, ra-tional actors, making decisions based on what will help grow their business and what will cause their businesses to stagnate or move backward. Such deci-sions inevitably include where a com-pany will do business and where it will be incorporated. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Develop-ment, or OECD, businesses contem-plating investment and other similar matters—especially incorporation in the United States—must first come to terms with the largest combined cor-porate tax rate among OECD member countries, which is currently at 39.1 percent. Some of my friends on the other side of the aisle like to counter these incon-venient facts by acknowledging the dif-ference between effective tax rates, which are rates after accounting for de-ductions and credits, and statutory tax rates. Of course, even when taking those differences into account and fo-cusing solely on effective rates, the United States only falls from the high-est to the fourth highest corporate rate among countries in the G20—and that is according to 2012 data that doesn’t yet capture recent tax reforms in the UK and elsewhere. In other words, whether we are talk-ing about effective rates or statutory rates in the United States, we are talk-ing about some of the highest cor-porate tax rates in the world, and, as the working group cochaired by Sen-ators PORTMAN and S CHUMER made clear, this translates into American companies constantly being put at a competitive disadvantage. It doesn’t take a Ph.D. in economics to recognize that this has had a major, negative im-pact on our economy and the ability of the American job creators to compete on the world stage. As a result of the astronomically high corporate tax rates in our coun-try, we have seen companies—that, keep in mind, have duties to their shareholders—engage in inversions, earnings stripping, and profit shifting, all of which erode our tax base and drive away American ingenuity and in-novation. These types of activities ship jobs, economic activity, intellectual property, and capital offshore, rather than keeping them right here in Amer-ica. The primary driver behind most of these practices—practices that have been decried in the harshest rhetoric by some of our friends here in the Sen-ate—is the desire to avoid or at the very least mitigate the impact of the U.S. corporate tax. While I am no fan of inversions or foreign takeovers or aggressive tax- planning techniques that shift profits around the globe in search of low taxes, and I don’t want to see any unneces-sary erosion of the U.S. tax base, I can hardly fault any company for simply responding to the incentives created by our business tax system and the com-petitive actions of other countries that have been lowering their corporate tax rates. Unfortunately, instead of recognizing the perverse incentives of our current tax system, coupled with companies’ duties to their shareholders, many of my Democratic friends—most notably, prominent officials in the previous ad-ministration—have derided the execu-tives and board members making these decisions, claiming that they lack, in the words of our previous U.S. Treas-ury Secretary, ‘‘economic patriotism.’’ The truth is that when it comes to our business tax system, some of our friends have buried their heads in the sand. Let’s take a quick stroll through re-cent history. In the 20 years between 1983 and 2003, there were just 29 cor-porate inversions in the United States. In the 11 years between 2003 and 2014— a period spanning both Democratic and Republican Presidencies—there were 47 tax inversions—nearly double the num-ber in half the amount of time. A quick review of changes in other industri-alized nations’ tax schemes will show that while the United States has stub-bornly maintained the same corporate tax rate for more than three decades, other countries have nimbly adapted to the growing competition in the global marketplace. I have spoken at length about inver-sions before, so I will not belabor the issue now. What I do want to say is that when I talk to board members and CEOs of some of the largest companies in the country, they tend to be un-equivocal when asked why they feel pressure to invert. Almost uniformly, their answer is our outrageously high corporate tax rate. Personally, I think this is one of the reasons why my friends and colleagues who sit on committees that regularly engage in these topics have come to recognize the level of our corporate tax rate as the major problem that it is. When I talk to constituents in Utah and Americans across the country, I hear of stagnant growth in wages and income, concerns over lack of opportu-nities and jobs, and worries about whether their employers will continue to operate here in the United States of America. Of course, the problem with our cor-porate tax system isn’t just that it incentivizes companies to move off-shore or discourages businesses from forming here in the United States in the first place; the problems actually run much deeper. Since 1947, the average growth of in-flation-adjusted GDP in the United States has been 3.2 percent. Unfortu-nately, in the 8 years of the Obama ad-ministration, the growth rate was an anemic 1.8 percent.

I know that several of my colleagues would, in response to those data points, argue that much of that is due to the great recession that took place at the initial stages of President Obama’s time in office; however, a quick review of the quarterly growth rates since 1947 will show that there are normally peri-ods of growth following recessions as the economy rebounds and the values of assets normalize again. In the case of the great recession of 2008 to 2009, that normal rebound did not occur, and a big reason why is the downward pres-sure imposed by our outdated tax scheme. Let’s remember that the reces-sion ended in June 2009—more than 8 years ago. Others still might argue that this is all academic. They might even be bra-zen enough to claim that when we talk about the corporate tax rate, we are talking about the problems of the rich and not the middle class. Again, any-one making such an argument would simply be ignoring the facts and could be considered an idiot. Make no mis-take—the crippling corporate tax rate in our country has stifled growth and investment in American businesses. This doesn’t just impact Wall Street investors or rich CEOs, it has a nega-tive effect on the middle class and on lower income workers. That effect comes in the form of fewer jobs, less in-vestment in America, and sluggish growth and productivity that fuels wage and income growth. Since 1953, real median family in-come in the United States—meaning that half of the country earned more and half of the country earned less— has grown at an average rate of 1.3 per-cent. Under the Obama administration, that same indicator—one of the best indicators of the true status of the middle class—grew at approximately half that rate, or 0.7 percent. The growth of the average hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory workers during the Obama administra-tion was half of the historic long-run average. What is more, labor force par-ticipation was set firmly on a down-ward trajectory throughout the Obama administration and has yet to recover. As you can see, there is clear evi-dence that the economy is not working well for many American workers and middle-class families. Anyone arguing that our current tax system is a ben-efit to the middle class is, in my view, sadly misinformed or being delib-erately misleading. Over the years, I have seen many of my friends on the other side come to the Senate floor demanding new stand-ards, higher wages, and increased pro-tections for middle-class workers. Yet many of the tax policies they tend to support would have the opposite effect. There is almost universal agreement among economists that the corporate tax is the most inefficient tax in exist-ence. In addition, a large percentage— some economists say as much as 75 per-cent—of the burden imposed by the corporate tax is borne by a corpora-tion’s employees. In other words, our high corporate tax rate isn’t just a bur-den on faceless corporations or rich shareholders, the burden is dispropor-tionately borne by the factory workers and scientists and even the janitors who work for corporations, large and small. A reduced corporate tax rate would allow American companies to compete with their international counterparts on a more level playing field. A re-duced corporate tax rate would mean fewer businesses would move offshore, taking their jobs and investments else-where. A reduced corporate tax rate would incentivize more new companies to set up shop in the United States and lead more established companies to in-vest their capital and hire workers here rather than in lower tax jurisdic-tions found in places like Canada, the UK, Ireland, or elsewhere. Mr. President, our shared goal should be to make the United States an invit-ing place to locate a business, invest, hire workers, and create new ideas and products, but that will not be the case so long as we cling to our punitive cor-porate tax system. Now, of course, when it comes to tax reform, our focus needs to move beyond the corporate tax rates. We need to talk about making the individual tax system simpler and fairer and offer tax relief to the middle class and small, passthrough businesses. We need to talk more about fixing our inter-national system to further improve the competitiveness of American job cre-ators and prevent further erosion of our tax base. And we need to remove burdens on savings and investment that keep middle-class Americans from generating and accumulating wealth for the future. I am going to talk more about all of these topics and others in the coming weeks and months. All of the improvements that we can make on these tax issues will become key elements of an effective tax reform package. In addition, I believe they are all areas where Republicans and Demo-crats can find agreement if we are all committed to the same goal—growing our economy to benefit the middle class. As I have said here on the floor many times, tax reform does not have to be another partisan exercise. I hope my Democratic colleagues will opt to join Republicans in this effort. As they have acknowledged the problems with our current tax system, I sincerely hope they will want to work with us to find a way to fix that tax system. As I said, I will have more to say in the near future, but these issues—our outdated business tax system and profanely high corporate tax rate—will not simply go away. I personally am committed to fixing these problems and will work with anyone who is will-ing to join the effort in good faith. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

NET NEUTRALITY  
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I come to the floor this afternoon with my colleague, the Senator from Ha-waii, who has been leading our efforts on coordinating a very loud and re-sounding voice on trying to stop the FCC from running over an open inter-net, and I thank him for his organiza-tion for today. I know we will be joined by our colleague, Senator W
YDEN from Oregon—and perhaps the other Senator from Oregon and several others—to talk about this important issue. We are here today to try to draw at-tention to one of those important eco-nomic issues before us: the need to pre-serve an open internet with strong net neutrality laws. We are facing a pivotal moment in the fight to preserve an open and fair internet. A strong and open internet is, without question, one of the great in-novations of our time and one of the great job creators of our time. Yet the Trump administration stands poised to undo the bedrock principle of net neu-trality in the face of evidence it would undermine our economy and undermine future job growth. The FCC has announced its intention to go against the demands of 5 million American consumers and reverse what is an existing rule so that big cable companies and telecom providers can erect toll lanes; that is, if you want fast internet speed, you have to pay more. This would threaten the funda-mental nature of our internet and the innovation economy. Last week, FCC Commissioner Cly-burn and I held a townhall meeting on net neutrality in Seattle. More than 300 people attended, and not one was in favor of paying higher prices to their cable company for worse or inhibited internet services. Many people shared their personal stories about how an internet with toll lanes would affect them negatively. We heard from many small businesses and startups that they were afraid of losing business because they might have to charge higher prices to their customers if these important protections were re-versed. I heard from people with health prob-lems and their concerns about health emergencies while away from home. The absence of net neutrality rules would mean that a doctor in their small hometown could not get critical information to the medical practi-tioners who are dealing with a patient in an emergency so that they could get important lifesaving treatments. Whether you are a doctor examining a patient via telemedicine or in an emer-gency room in Seattle or a student in a rural community trying to access the

internet to get information, take a test or do research, a fast connection is nec-essary. Your ability to have a fast con-nection is something you are more than just a little concerned about. Being artificially slowed down in favor of big companies that buy faster lanes would turn our economy in the wrong direction. Our economy is in the midst of a massive technological transformation. As technology advances, incredible op-portunities and new jobs are created. Every business plan of every startup relies on the ability to get content to consumers. Largely as a result of innovation and the proliferation of hundreds of startups in the United States, the internet economy today is now worth $966 billion and accounts for almost 6 percent of our U.S. GDP. This is a high-er percentage of the U.S. economy than many other industry sectors, including construction, mining, utilities, agri-culture, and education. Net neutrality—meaning you have an open internet that is not artificially slowed down unless you pay a ransom— is important for small businesses and startups and entrepreneurs who rely so much now on an integrated business model where internet access, mar-keting, and advertising their products and services to reach customers is crit-ical. We need an open internet. We need it to foster job creation, competition, and innovation for the almost 3 million Americans workers who already rely on the internet economy today. When net neutrality was imple-mented a year-plus ago, we were pro-tecting and making sure there was no uneven playing field. Basically, be-cause of the regulations, we were able to help small businesses and entre-preneurs thrive. But our internet pro-viders are internet gatekeepers, and without net neutrality, they would seize upon the opportunity to change that. One slice of the internet economy— the app economy, which is growing every single day—consists of everyone who makes money and has a job, thanks to mobile apps powered by an open internet. Today, 1.7 million Amer-icans have jobs because of this econ-omy. Nearly 92,000 of those jobs are in my State of Washington. Over the past 5 years, the app econ-omy jobs have grown at an annual rate of 30 percent. I don’t know of another sector that is growing that fast. The average growth rate for all other jobs is about 1.6 percent. By 2020, the app economy could grow to over $100 bil-lion. Why is this so important? Because we all know that these various applica-tions and apps make our lives better. They make it easier. In a busy world, they are helping us do the things that are so important to us with more ease and more certainty. The internet economy is dynamic and supercharged in creating job growth. This phenomenon of economic growth trajectory would not be pos-sible without the internet as a plat-form for economic activity. This is why it is so important that the FCC not, in the dark of night, put down a rule without public comment to try to stop and change this direction that has al-ready been protected by past FCC Com-missioners. This is why my colleagues and I are here today on a date when ev-erybody is trying to raise awareness— because the FCC could act as early as August 18 to try to change these rules. It is important that we oppose any new FCC actions trying to dismantle an open internet. We need to make sure we are talking about the harm to con-sumers, the harm to innovation, and the fact that internet speeds for Amer-ican consumers are important and con-sumers shouldn’t be burdened by a cable company holding you at ransom to pay more just to get faster speeds. Consumers are already struggling with high prices. Cable bills rose 39 per-cent from 2011 to 2015, eight times the rate of inflation. In 2015, the average consumer cable TV bill was $99 a month; just a year later, the average consumer cable bill had risen by 4 per-cent to over $103. My guess is a lot of people listening to this now are prob-ably thinking, boy, where are we today? One of the most popular arguments by the enemies of an open internet is that it suppresses investment and leaves consumers with poor broadband infrastructure. That is a false claim. Data shows that investment by pub-licly traded cable companies and big telephone companies was 5 percent higher during the 2-year period fol-lowing our protection of an open inter-net. Clearly, people are continuing to make investment. I want to make sure people under-stand that we do not want to see a change in this policy. We do not want to see American consumers run over by large cable companies that are de-manding higher rates. We want to make sure that we don’t end up with a two-tiered internet system—one for big companies who will pay and pay and pay for faster rates, and consumers who are left with a very slowed-down, challenging to use internet, which makes it hard for us to continue to in-novate. I encourage the American consumer to go out and contact the FCC. Yes, your voice can be heard. The FCC has already received 5 million comments, and they have until August 17 to hear more. Today, we are asking everybody in America to say: Please don’t slow down my internet connection. Don’t hurt our economy; don’t hurt Amer-ican business. Invest in innovation, and keep an open internet for the future. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Hawaii. Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington for her leadership on tech and technology issues and, in particular, on net neu-trality. I would like to amend one thing she said. She said that we got about 5 mil-lion comments in favor of net neu-trality on this question. It is true. Yes-terday we had 5 million and change, but I just checked, and we are at 6.728 million, and more and more people are weighing in on this important issue. As of today, it is important to point out that net neutrality is the law of the land. We are not asking for a change in the way that the internet op-erates. We are asking for the internet, as we know it, to be preserved. What does that really mean? It means you have an arrangement with your ISP. You pay your internet serv-ice provider for access to the internet, and you get the whole internet. Your provider does not get to decide what you access. You do. Whether it is NBC or ABC, Hulu or Netflix or Breitbart or Google or Yahoo or Facebook or the New York Times or RedState or HotAir or whatever you want, you get to go there, and everything comes down from the internet at whatever speed it comes down. But without net neu-trality, that arrangement could change. The free and open internet, as we un-derstand it, is a premise of the way we use the internet. It is a premise of the internet economy. It is a premise of Silicon Valley. It has now become a premise of car companies and real es-tate companies and anybody who does business online that, of course, you wouldn’t have to pay money to an ISP to make sure your website loads fast enough so that consumers can see it. But that freedom, that free and open internet, really is in danger. Here is what is happening: The FCC, the Federal Communications Commis-sion, is trying to change the internet by ending the net neutrality rules that were put in place. If they succeed, your ISP will have the power to stop you from seeing certain kinds of content. They will be the ones that get to make decisions about what you can access and how fast—not you. It is a foundational change in the way the internet operates. Now, some people—including the internet company lobbyists and their CEOs—will say: Look, the companies aren’t going to change the internet even if the law goes away. In fact, we are committing to voluntary net neu-trality. That is what they say. But I want you to think about how likely it is that a publicly traded com-pany will not at least explore the possi-bility of different business models, and here is the problem: There may be op-portunities without net neutrality for them to make more money. Right now I have basic cable in my apartment. I don’t have HBO. Back in Hawaii I have HBO and the whole deal, but in my apartment here I have more basic cable. I pay for a certain number of channels. I don’t get access to the entire TV universe. I pay for packages. There is no reason under the law, should they repeal net neutrality, that

an ISP couldn’t give the liberal pack-age, which you could pay $75 for, or the conservative package, which you could pay $75 for, or the NBC-related families package, which you could pay $120 for— or maybe it is free because it is part of a vertical, which is included in your ISP. The whole idea is that there is noth-ing preventing them—except these net neutrality laws—from deciding whom you get, where you get to visit, and how fast the downloads come. This is especially important, of course, in the entertainment space, when we are all streaming TV, news, movies, and even gaming online so the relationship be-tween the person who creates the con-tent and you is going to be intermedi-ated by an ISP. If you have a great app idea, right now you just have to have a great app idea. If you have a great website, peo-ple can log on to your website and you are in business. If you have the next great website, if you have eBay or Craigslist or Amazon, but it is post-net neutrality and the FCC goes through with this, you will not need a bunch of engineers but a bunch of lawyers and business sharks to try to negotiate with the ISP to even get in the door. Students could have less access to online resources, including online classes. Realtors would be stopped from using online tools to sell their homes. Patients might not able to use the internet to communicate with their doctors or monitor their health. Musi-cians, photographers, entrepreneurs will use the tools everybody depends on to make a living or share their art on-line. I was talking to somebody I know in the tech community, and they were saying that this is a parade of horribles. None of this is going to come true. I asked: Why do you think that is true? Why do you think this is just some apocryphal scenario I am describ-ing? If you were an ISP, why wouldn’t you slice up the internet and sell it for more? If you are the one controlling the access to it and you are a publicly traded company, you have no duty to a free and open internet. You have a duty to maximize shareholder profits. If your board of directors comes to you and says: You know what, this whole ‘‘you pay a flat fee and you get the whole internet,’’ that is not the right business model. Look at these areas where ISPs are the only provider in many communities. The idea that the consumer has a choice in lots of rural communities, you have only one broadband provider in the first place. Why wouldn’t a broadband provider slice and dice up the internet and charge you a la carte? They can get more money for this. It is not that they are bad people. It is that they are duty bound to maximize profits. Today, July 12, is the day of action. The internet is pushing back. Today we stand up to the FCC so the internet re-mains free and open. As we speak—I mean literally as we speak—thousands and thousands of people across the country by the minute are logging on to the FCC website to express them-selves. I have to say, this has become a Democratic issue. This has become a progressive issue, but it wasn’t so long ago that people in the conservative movement were worried about media consolidation and the conservative movement was saying: Hey, listen, I don’t know who is going to own my media company, but I want to get to my websites to get my content at whatever rate it comes down. Don’t tell me what information I get to have access to. Everybody uses the internet. Many people are spending dozens of hours a week on the internet via their phones, via their television, via their broadband connection at home, and the innovation economy that underlies our economic growth is really in jeopardy. I know it is an arcane process. I know most people probably haven’t even heard of the FCC. To talk about net neutrality and lay all this jargon on you, it is concerning that the free and open internet is really in danger. We have this unique opportunity because unlike what happened a few months ago with consumer privacy, where very quickly this body reversed a rule that provides for privacy so your broadband providers can’t resell your personal browsing data to a third-party adver-tiser or any other company—that hap-pened very quickly and without any public input. Here is the really good thing about the FCC process. The statute provides for public input. We are in a public comment period, and July 17 is the deadline. There is an opportunity for people to let their voices be heard. The internet should be in the hands of peo-ple, not in the hands of companies. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. G
ARDNER ). The Senator from Massa-chusetts. Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I join with the Senator from Hawaii, the Sen-ator from Washington State, and I know the Senator from Oregon is going to be joining us very soon and taking this long, hot summer day in Wash-ington and turning up the heat on the Trump administration and the big broadband companies. Today the internet is having a pro-test. More than 80,000 websites are par-ticipating in today’s national day of action on net neutrality to stand up for the fundamental right for a free and open internet. Today’s action involves some of the internet’s biggest names: Netflix, Twit-ter, Amazon, Snapchat, Mozilla, Yelp, Airbnb. It also includes many others. My own website and other Democratic Senators and House Members have joined in today’s protests. Earlier today, right outside on the Capitol lawn, I gathered with many of my Senate and House colleagues, along with businesses and advocacy, con-sumer protection, nonprofit, and polit-ical organizations to send a singular message: We will defend net neutrality. Net neutrality is the basic principle that says that all internet traffic is treated equally. It applies the prin-ciples of nondiscrimination to the on-line world, ensuring that internet serv-ice providers—AT&T, Charter, Verizon, Comcast, among others—do not block, do not slow down, do not censor or prioritize internet traffic. Yet today, the internet—this monu-mental, diverse, dynamic, democratic platform—is under attack. President Trump and his FCC Chairman, Ajit Pai, are threatening to disrupt this hallmark of American innovation and democracy by gutting net neutrality rules. They have put internet freedom on the chopping block. We are facing a historic fight. If Trump’s FCC gets its way, a hand-ful of big broadband companies will serve as gatekeepers to the internet. We cannot let this happen. That is why millions of Americans are standing up and making sure their voices are heard at the Federal Communications Com-mission. They know the internet—the world’s greatest platform for commerce and communications—is at stake. It is net neutrality that ensures that those with the best ideas, not merely the best ac-cess, can thrive in the 21st century economy; that a garage-based startup in Malden, MA, can have the same on-line reach and scope as a major tech firm in Silicon Valley. It is net neutrality that has made the Internet an innovation incubator and job generator for the entire Nation. It is net neutrality that has been the internet’s chief governing principle since its inception. Consider that today essentially every company is an internet company. In 2016, almost half of the venture capital funds invested in the United States went toward internet-specific and soft-ware companies. That is $25 billion worth of venture capital funding in our country. Half of all venture capital went into that sector, this innovation sector that continues to transform not only our own economy but the whole world’s economy. At the same time, to meet America’s insatiable demand for broadband internet, U.S. broadband and telecommunications industry com-panies invested more than $87 billion in capital expenditures in 2015. That is the highest rate of annual investment in the last 10 years by the broadband companies. We have hit a sweet spot. Investment in broadband and wireless technologies is high. Job creation is high. Venture capital investment in online startups is high. That is what we want. We want both the broadband companies and all of these smaller companies—whose names escape us because there are tens of thousands of them—to have a chance to coexist and have the innovation con-tinue, even as the large companies con-tinue to invest in broadband expansion.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES3946 July 12, 2017 
It is the free and open internet that has allowed us to enter a new phase of the digital revolution—the internet of things era—where our devices, our ap-pliances, and everyday machines now connect with one another. The digital revolution is a global eco-nomic engine, and net neutrality is its best fuel. Taking these rules off the books makes no sense. With these net neutrality protections in place, there is no problem that needs fixing. It is working right now perfectly. In May, Chairman Ajit Pai and the Republican FCC voted to begin a pro-ceeding that will effectively eliminate net neutrality protections, allowing a handful of broadband providers to con-trol the internet. Chairman Pai’s pro-posal would decimate the open internet order and the net neutrality rules that are protecting the free flow of ideas, commerce, and communications in our country. Now the big broadband barons and their Republican allies say we need a light-touch regulatory framework. Let’s be honest. When the broadband behemoths say ‘‘light touch,’’ what they really mean is ‘‘hands off’’—hands off their ability to choose online win-ners and losers. We are not fooled when AT&T en-gages in alternative facts and says they support net neutrality and today’s day of action. They don’t support title II, and they don’t support net neu-trality. We must shine light on this kind of corporate deception. What the broadband providers really want is an unregulated online eco-system where they can stifle the devel-opment of competing services that can-not afford an internet easy pass. Chairman Pai says he likes net neu-trality but simply wants to eliminate the very order that established today’s net neutrality rules. That is like say-ing you want to have your cake and eat it too. It makes no sense. President Trump and his Republican allies are waging an all-out assault on every front that they can on our core democratic values. Whether it is healthcare, immigration, climate change, or net neutrality, they want to end the vital protections that safe-guard our families and hand over power to corporations and special interests. We know better. We need to make our voices heard. A political firestorm of opposition will protect our economy, protect our free speech, protect our democracy. We must protect net neutrality as a core principle in a modern 21st century America, in a modern America where the smallest company online can aspire to reach all 320 million Americans in a nondiscriminatory way, where the smallest company can raise the capital in order to accomplish that goal, where the smallest company doesn’t have to ask for permission to be able to inno-vate in our society, where the smallest doesn’t have to first raise the money to ensure they can pay to have access to this incredible economic engine of en-trepreneurial expression that has been the internet for this last generation, where free speech, the First Amend-ment, this ability to be able to speak unfettered, uncontrolled by corporate America and whether or not you can afford to speak, is something that con-tinues to be protected in our country. That is what net neutrality is all about. The principles of nondiscrim-inatory access is what gave us Google and eBay, Amazon and Hulu, YouTube and Etsy, Zulily, Wayfair, TripAdvisor, and company after company that knew they could access every single poten-tial consumer in our country and could, as a result, raise the capital nec-essary to ensure that engine of eco-nomic entrepreneurial innovation could be deployed from their minds in changing fundamentally the economy of our country and the economy of the world. In 2017, every company is an internet company. Every company depends upon free and open access to the internet. That is what we have been transformed into in just the last 20 years. I was the Democratic coauthor of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. In 1996, not one home in America had broadband. Can I say that again? Just 20 years ago, not one home in America had broadband. But we changed the rules to create this chaotic entrepre-neurial world where all of a sudden all of these companies whose names are now common household names could be created, transforming our economy. There is no problem. They are trying to fix a problem that does not exist. We need to give the next generation of entrepreneurs the same opportunity to innovate that the last generation had—not to get permission, not to ask: Pretty please, may I reach all 320 mil-lion Americans? No, ladies and gentle-men, that is not what this revolution is about. That is not what young people all across this country—with brilliant new ideas to further transform our American economy online—want to have as an obstacle. What will happen now is you will have an idea, but if you can’t raise the money to pay for this fast-lane broadband access, that is going to throttle back your ability to be able to move in this agile way that the inter-net provides. Instead of agility, it will be hostility that you will be feeling as an entrepreneur, feeling you can’t take the risk—you are not sure you can reach your customers; you are not sure you can pay the broadband company— rather than ensuring that you can reach all these consumers for your rev-olutionary idea. This internet day of action we are having across the country is going to raise from 5 million, to 6 million, to 7 million, to 10 million, to 15 million, to 20 million, the number of Americans who are going to be saying to the Fed-eral Communications Commission and to the U.S. House and Senate that something is fundamentally wrong with this FCC and its potential change of the internet—Open Internet Order. If they do move, we are going to court. If they do move, we are going to be taking this all the way to the Su-preme Court of the United States of America because that is how important this issue is. It goes right to the funda-mental nature of what has happened to our economy in the last 20 years. And that is all it took. We moved from the black rotary dial phone to a world where everyone is carrying a computer in their pockets. It happened just like that. It could have happened before that, but it wasn’t possible because the broadband companies didn’t even exist. There were just telephone companies and cable companies that did not have a vision of the future. Their vision of the future is a lot like their vision of the past before that law passed, which is, let’s go back to total control by a small handful of companies in our com-munications cocktail, rather than thinking of the future, as tens of thou-sands, hundreds of thousands of small-er companies can be started up in dorm rooms and garages across our Nation. This is a dangerous and harmful plan the FCC has on the books today. To-day’s day of internet action will be in-creasing as each moment goes by be-tween now and the day they make that decision at the FCC. Mr. President, I yield back the re-mainder of my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Connecticut. Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I want to build on the last point my col-league—a great advocate and champion of net neutrality—made about the rule of law and about the need to go to court when there is utter disrespect and contempt for the rule of law, which is reflected in the prospective plan of the Chairman of the FCC to undo that agency’s net neutrality rules. It re-flects an astonishing lack of respect and care for that agency’s rules—in fact, the rules that apply to all agen-cies under the Administrative Proce-dure Act. Chairman Pai wants to overturn a rule that was established after a fact-finding—an elaborate process of com-ment and response—without going through that same process that is re-quired under the Administrative Proce-dure Act, a fact-based docket that re-quires him to show that something has changed—not a little bit; something significant has changed—in the market since the Open Internet Order was es-tablished in February 2015. The burden is on the FCC to make that finding. That finding is impossible, which is why they are avoiding the attempt to do it. The fact is, the Open Internet Order was established based on 10 years of evidence about how internet access service provides people with broadband. It has been upheld by the DC Circuit Court of Appeals twice over the last year. The thicket of law that the Chairman wants to simply leap over—it is not within his discretion to do.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S3947 July 12, 2017 
The most recent evidence shows that net neutrality has not inhibited net-work investment at all, in contrast to Chairman Pai’s claims. According to statements this year by the internet service providers—AT&T, in fact, is ex-panding fiber deployment and calling fiber a growth opportunity. Comcast is saying that it doubles its network ca-pacity every 18 to 24 months. Verizon is announcing a new $1 billion investment in cable. That is why we are here say-ing we will not and we cannot allow Chairman Pai to succeed in this plan to gut neutrality at the behest of big cable companies. I am proud to speak today in support of the Day of Action to Save Net Neu-trality and against the FCC proposal to undo the Open Internet Order because it is really a consummate pro-con-sumer measure. The Open Internet Order serves the best interests of con-sumers directly but also the best inter-ests of competition in promoting inno-vation, new ideas, and insights—an open platform that is necessary for in-novation and insights that benefit con-sumers, as well as the products and services that companies generally pro-vide. The Open Internet Order created three bright-line rules: No blocking, no throttling, and no pay prioritization. These rules apply to both fixed and mo-bile broadband service, which protects consumers no matter how they access the internet, whether on a desktop or a mobile service. Consumers deserve equal access, an open platform—no walls benefiting the companies that may want their gardens walled in. The walls are against consumer interest, and breaking down those walls is what the open internet rule sought to do. It also has real First Amendment sig-nificance. In one of the most recently proposed megamergers—AT&T and Time Warner—clearly content, access, and neutrality are at stake. This merg-er gives the combined company, if the merger is approved, both the incentive and the means to throttle First Amendment expression. There have been reports that the White House will use this merger, in fact, to throttle the First Amendment rights of CNN, which is owned by Time Warner. This would be a direct threat to all First Amend-ment liberties. Using antitrust policy and power to diminish or demean the rights of free expression would be a grave disservice to this country, as well as the rule of law. That is why I have written to the nominee for the Department of Justice Antitrust Division chief, the Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust, Makan Delrahim, and asked for a meeting so he can ensure us that, in fact, antitrust policy will be independently enforced, that these reports do not reflect his view or the administration policy. I want him to assure us that this merger will in no way be used to influence or impede any media outlet. But access and an open internet are principles that go beyond the enforce-ment of antitrust law; they are prin-ciples enforced by the FCC for the pub-lic good. That is why this Day of Ac-tion to Save Net Neutrality is so criti-cally important, because the grassroots movement here is what will save the day. The grassroots and consumer-driv-en impetus to make sure that the internet remains a free and open plat-form for consumers and innovators, not a walled garden for wealthy companies, is what we seek today. That is why I am proud to stand with other colleagues who have spoken and to continue this battle and to say to all of our colleagues that we will go to court, because the rule of law and the Administrative Procedure Act are not technical, abstruse, arcane, unimpor-tant rules; they are at the core of fair-ness and administrative regularity, not just regulation, the rule of law. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor to my colleague from Oregon. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Oregon. Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, before he leaves the floor, let me just commend my friend from Connecticut on a very thoughtful statement. He has worked on these issues for many years since his days as attorney general in Con-necticut. He is, in my view, the Sen-ate’s best lawyer. So it is great to have a chance to team up with him and our colleagues. I think this issue can really be summed up in a sentence, and that is this: Without net neutrality, you do not have a free and open internet be-cause the essence of the internet—and I will explain what we have today— would simply not be the same. Today—and this is what net neu-trality is all about, in a sentence— after you pay your internet access fee, you get to go where you want, when you want, and how you want, and ev-erybody is treated the same. From the most affluent person in America to those who are walking on an economic tightrope every single day, they all can use the internet to get access to those fundamental opportunities that are so essential to increasing the quality of life for our people. This, for example, is how a young person will have a chance to learn. If they are in a small, rural community in Colorado, Oregon, or elsewhere, this is how they get access to the kind of information that afflu-ent kids get, who might live in Beverly Hills or Palm Beach or in any one of a number of communities where there are affluent people. This is what puts that youngster on the same plane as the affluent person. This is how, for ex-ample, those who are searching for jobs can go to the net and quickly get ac-cess to information where they will have a chance to get ahead. The internet—and a free and open internet—is particularly important to our startups, the innovators, and the small businesses that we are all count-ing on to have a chance to grow big. When you talk, particularly, to the small tech startups, they will say: Our goal is to be Google or Facebook. Inno-vation is what makes it possible to have those kinds of dreams. If you are starting small, with real net neu-trality, as I have described it, you have the same chance to succeed as every-body else in America. Now the challenge here is that very powerful interests—the cable compa-nies, for example—want to change that. They want to change what I de-scribed as net neutrality. They would like to set up what they call priority lanes, special lanes, or toll lanes, where, if you pay more, you can get ac-cess to more. You can get access to more content, and you can get access to data and information more quickly. What this really does is that it means those other people I was talking about—that startup trying to come out of the gate and be a success in the mar-ketplace, students, and people who need information about healthcare and jobs and the like—are not treated the same way as the people with the deep pockets. All of a sudden their access to data and information is going to be dif-ferent. It might be slower. Maybe they will not get it at all. The big powerful interests aren’t going to tell everybody in America that they are against net neutrality. They will not be holding rallies saying: We have gotten together to oppose net neutrality. They will not be showing up in Denver, Minneapolis, Portland, or anywhere else and saying: We are against net neutrality. The reason they can’t is because the public overwhelm-ingly supports net neutrality, as I have described it. They are going to say things like this: They are for net neutrality, but they just don’t want all this govern-ment associated with what they have. They will be for voluntary net neu-trality. I know the Presiding Officer of the Senate has young children as well. I can tell you that we are about as likely to make voluntary net neutrality work as we are to get William Peter Wyden, my 9-year-old son, to voluntarily agree to limit himself to one dessert with his deciding whether he has met his limit. It is not going to happen. Voluntary net neutrality isn’t that different than what we have had in a lot of instances before we had real net neutrality. The big cable companies and others were always looking for dodges and loopholes, and they found ways to tack on fees and the like be-cause that has always been their end game. Boy, it is a lawyer’s full employ-ment program because they have the capacity to litigate this. So this idea that people are going to hear a lot about in the next few weeks—that they are really for net neutrality, but we will just make it voluntary—I want people to under-stand that the history of those kinds of approaches is not exactly sterling. I think it is about as likely to be suc-cessful as limiting my kid to volun-tarily holding back on dessert.

I also want to make clear what our challenge is going to be about because the Federal Communications Commis-sion—Senator B
LUMENTHAL talked about it and others—is going to be making decisions on this before too long. We know where the votes are. This is going to be a long battle, but one of the reasons I wanted to come to the floor today is to say that this is an-other one of these issues that is going to show that political change doesn’t start in Washington, DC, and then trickle down to people. It will be bot-tom-up, as more and more Americans find out what is at stake here. A few years back, I would say the Presiding Officer of the Senate—and I see my colleague from the Finance Committee here, as well—and my col-leagues will remember the PIPA and SOPA bills. These were the bills, PIPA and SOPA, that were anti-internet bills. As with so much, people can have a difference of opinion, and the spon-sors said: We have to fight piracy. We have to fight piracy, people ripping ev-erybody off online. To fight piracy, we will use these two bills to kind of change the architecture of the inter-net, particularly the domain name sys-tem, which is basically the phone book of the internet. I looked at it, and I said: We are all against piracy. We are against people selling fake Viagra, or whatever it is online, but why would we want to wreck the architecture of the internet in order to deal with it? There are other kinds of remedies. So I put in a bill with a conservative Republican in the other body to come up with an alternative approach, and I put a hold on PIPA and SOPA. Here in the Senate, at that time, 44 Senators were cosponsors of that bill. That is an army—out of the 100, 44 Senators. Everybody said: You know, R
ONis putting a hold on it, and, well, he is a nice guy and, you know, he is from Or-egon. Everybody smiled, and I said: OK, I understand that you think this is going to be a slam dunk, but I think I will tell you that you should know that there are more Americans who spend more time online in a week than they do thinking about their U.S. Senator in 2 years, and they aren’t going to be happy with a whole bunch of powerful interests messing with the internet, just as we are doing with this situation where people want to unravel real net neutrality. So a vote was scheduled on whether to oppose my hold—in effect, lift my hold—on this flawed bill, and 4 days be-fore the vote, more than 10 million Americans called, texted, tweeted, and logged in to say to their Senator: Do not vote to lift R
ONWYDEN ’s hold. About 36 hours after Americans had weighed in, the Senate leadership called me, not very happy, and said: You won. We are not going to have a vote. Your hold has prevailed. I bring this up only by way of saying that it is going to take that same kind of grassroots uprising for Americans who want to keep real net neutrality, which is what you have after you pay your internet access fee, and you get to go where you want, when you want, and how you want, and everybody is treated equally in those efforts. For all of us who want to keep that, we need to understand that we are in for a long battle. We know where the votes are at the Federal Communications Commis-sion, but that is just the beginning. That is just the beginning. So now is the time to make your voice heard. Go to battleforthenet.com so your voices can be heard. Make sure that Donald Trump’s FCC Commis-sioner knows your view that the inter-net is better and stronger with real net neutrality protections. Americans have only until July 17 to do this. I have already been speaking out in other kinds of sessions. So I think I will leave it at that. I wish to close by saying again that without real strong net neutrality, which is what we have today, we will not have a free and open internet for all Americans to enjoy. So I come to the floor to say this is going to be a long battle. Nobody thought we had a prayer to win the fight to protect the internet that was PIPA and SOPA, and I am sure a lot of people are saying that this is another one where the pow-erful interests are going to win. I say to the Senate again: Not so fast. You are going to see the power of Americans speaking out. I urge all the people of this country who are fol-lowing what goes on in the Senate today and in the days ahead to be part of this effort, because I think if they do, if we show that political change isn’t top-down but bottom-up, it is going to be a long battle, but we will win, and our country will keep a bed-rock principle of the free and open internet, which is real net neutrality. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. LEE). The Senator from Texas. 
HEALTHCARE LEGISLATION  
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, as we continue to discuss the Better Care Act, which is an alternative bill that we will propose next week and vote on, which takes the disaster known as ObamaCare which for millions of Americans has led to sky-high pre-miums and unaffordable deductibles, if they can even find an insurance com-pany that will sell them an insurance product—we will propose a better care act, as we call it, not a perfect care act but a better care act. It would be even better if our Demo-cratic colleagues would join us and work with us in this effort, but as we have come to find out, they are unwill-ing to acknowledge the failures of ObamaCare. So we are forced to do this without their assistance. It would be better if it were bipartisan, if they would work with us, but they have made it very clear that they are not in-terested in changing the broken struc-ture of ObamaCare. What I predict is that what they would offer is an insur-ance company bailout, throwing per-haps hundreds of billions of dollars at insurance companies in order to sus-tain a broken ObamaCare that will never work—no matter how much money you throw at it. So people will continue to suffer from the failures of ObamaCare unless we will have the courage to step forward and to say we are going to do the very best we can with the tough hand we have been dealt to help save the American people who are being hurt right now. Basically, there are four principles involved. One is we want to stabilize the individual insurance market, which is the one that insurance companies are fleeing now because they are bleed-ing red ink. They can’t make any money, and they are tired of losing money so they basically pull their roots up and leave town, leaving cus-tomers in the lurch. Secondly, we want to make sure we actually lower insurance premiums. Under the original discussion draft bill that we introduced about a week or so ago, the Congressional Budget Office said we will see premiums go down as much as 30 percent over time. Now, I wish I could say we were going to be able to have an immediate effect on those premiums, but the truth is this is much better than our friends across the aisle have offered us with the offer to basically sustain a broken ObamaCare system. The third thing we want to do is pro-tect people who might have their health insurance hurt or impeded by preexisting conditions. We want to maintain the current law so people are protected when they leave their work or when they change jobs. The fourth is, we want to put Med-icaid on a sustainable path. Medicaid is one of the three major entitlement pro-grams, and now we spend roughly $400 billion on Medicaid in this country. Our friends across the aisle don’t want to do anything that would keep that from growing higher and higher and higher, to the point where basically the system collapses. We believe that is not the responsible choice. What we propose is to spend $71 billion more on Medicaid over the budget window and to work to transition those States that have expanded Medicaid and offer their people a better option in the private in-surance area, but I just want to men-tion that I have shared a number of stories about, for example, a small business owner in Donna, TX, who was forced to fire their employees so they could afford to keep the doors open and provide health insurance for the re-maining people. You have to ask: What in the world could lead us to a system which would discourage people from hiring more folks and basically put them in a position where they had to fire them in order to make ends meet? But that is what the employer mandate did under ObamaCare. If you have more than 50 employees, you are subject to

the employer mandate. You get pun-ished unless you make sure your em-ployees are covered with insurance, and many times it is unaffordable so it had the perverse impact of small busi-nesses saying: We can’t afford to grow the number of people who are working in our business or we are going to need to shrink it in order to avoid that pen-alty. Stories like this remind me of just how important our efforts are to repeal and replace ObamaCare. The status quo is not working. In fact, every year ObamaCare gets worse for the millions of people in the indi-vidual market in particular. It is im-portant that ObamaCare is not just about insurance. ObamaCare is about penalties that are being imposed on businesses that hurt their ability to grow and create jobs. That is one rea-son I believe that since the great reces-sion of 2008, where ordinarily you would see a sharp bounce up in the economy, that the economy has been largely flat and has not been growing, in part, because of the penalties, man-dates, and regulations associated with ObamaCare. Not only has ObamaCare made health insurance more expensive while taking away choices, it also has compounded fundamental problems with important safety net programs like Medicaid. I wish to share a story from an emer-gency room employee in Lake Granbury, TX, who wrote to me about the alarming trend she has noticed in the hospital where she works. She says, because fewer and fewer physicians will see a Medicaid patient, she has seen an influx of these Medicaid patients who ostensibly have coverage coming to the emergency room for their primary care. As she points out, this is not a good situation for patients and hos-pitals. In my State, according to the latest survey of the Texas Medical As-sociation that I have seen, only 31 per-cent of doctors in Texas will see a new Medicaid patient. That may sound crazy, but let me explain why. Because Medicaid basically pays a physician about half of what private insurance pays when it comes to see a patient, many of them simply say: Well, I can’t afford to see a lot of Medicaid patients. I need to balance that or at least make sure I see enough private insurance pa-tients to make sure I can keep the doors open and meet my obligations. What happens when fewer and fewer doctors actually see Medicaid patients is, people end up showing up in the emergency room for their primary care because they can’t find a doctor to see them. The truth is, medical outcomes based on many studies that have been done in recent years are that Medicaid coverage in those instances can be no worse and no better than not having in-surance at all. ObamaCare was put in place ostensibly to avoid reliance on emergency rooms for access to care, but as we all know, ObamaCare hasn’t lived up to many of its promises and unfortunately making stories like this one commonplace. I mentioned this earlier, but just to see the trend line, in 2000, 60 percent of Texas physicians accepted new Med-icaid patients; today that number is 34 percent. I think I may have earlier said 31 percent. It is actually 34 percent, due to lower rates of provider reim-bursement, leaving places like Lake Granbury in the lurch and causing them to have to turn to the emergency room for their primary care as a last resort. Every 2 years, Texas doctors fight with the Texas legislature to raise pay-ments for the Medicaid system, but the reality is, there is not enough money to go around, even though it is the No. 1 or No. 2 budget item in the Texas leg-islature’s budget every year, and it is growing so fast it is crowding out ev-erything from higher education to law enforcement and other priorities. Across the country, Medicaid spend-ing has ballooned out of control. In Texas, 25 percent of the State’s budget, as I indicated, is dedicated to this pro-gram, 25 percent of its overall budget— usually No. 1 or No. 2. So we have to be honest with our-selves and the people we represent that this situation is not sustainable. We owe it to the millions of people to make sure the people who really need it—the fragile, elderly, disabled adults and children—that it is there for them, not only now but in the future. That is why we have been discussing ways we might strengthen the sustainability of Medicaid to ensure that families who actually need it can rely on it, and they don’t have the rug pulled out from under them. This requires doing some hard work of reforming the way States handle Medicaid funding. For example, Medicaid, as is cur-rently applied, States are only allowed to review their list of Medicaid recipi-ents once a year, but a lot can happen in a period of a year. Somebody can get a job, and they may be no longer eligi-ble based on the income qualifications for Medicaid. If they can only check once a year, then people remain on the rolls, even though they may no longer qualify. Regardless of whether some-body gets a job or moves or passes away or no longer needs Medicaid, they are still in the system, and there is nothing the States can do about it. We would like to change that. While it sounds like a simple matter, when the average Medicaid patient costs the State more than $9,000 each and as high as almost $12,000 per elderly individual, it adds up. One of the things we saw that ObamaCare did in the States that ex-panded Medicaid coverage is that those States decided to cover single adults who are capable of working. This bill would also allow States to experiment with a work requirement as part of the eligibility for Medicaid. We are not mandating it, saying they have to do it, but if the State chooses to do it, then they can do so. We need to give the States the flexibility they need so they can use the Medicaid funding they have more efficiently so more people can get access to quality care. I want to be clear: 4.7 million Texans rely on Medicaid. Of course, those rolls tend to churn based on people’s em-ployment and their family cir-cumstance, but it is not going any-where. We want to make sure we pre-serve Medicaid for the people who actu-ally need it the most. We are working to make it stronger, more efficient, and, yes, more sustainable. I guess some people live in a fantasy world, where they think we can continue to spend money we don’t have and there will never be any consequences associ-ated with it. The fastest items of spending in the Federal budget are en-titlement programs including Med-icaid. Right now we are at $20 trillion. We have done a pretty good job—I know we don’t get much credit for it— we have done a pretty good job of con-trolling discretionary spending, but the 70 percent of mandatory spending, in-cluding Medicaid, has been going up, on average, about 5.5 percent a year. That can’t happen in perpetuity. Right now, we know we have $20 trillion, roughly, in debt—$20 trillion. It is frankly im-moral for those of us who are adults today to spend money borrowed from the next generation and beyond be-cause somebody ultimately is going to have to pay it back, and it is going to have real-world consequences. We know that since the great reces-sion, the Federal Reserve has kept in-terest rates very low through their monetary policy, but we know as well that as the economy tends to get a lit-tle bit better and unemployment comes down, they are going to begin inching those interest rates up little by little, which means we are going to end up paying the people who own our debt, our bondholders, more and more money strictly for the purpose of giving them a return on their investment for the debt they buy. This is an opportunity for us not only to put Medicaid on a sustainable path, to do the responsible thing, to give the States ultimate flexi-bility in terms of how they handle it, it is also a matter of keeping faith with the next generation and beyond when it comes to this unsustainable debt burden. I hear people talk about slashing Medicaid despite the fact that the Con-gressional Budget Office estimates that Medicaid spending will grow by $71 bil-lion over the next 10 years. Only in Washington, DC, is that considered a cut, where spending next year exceeds what it is this year and the next and so on, and it goes up by $71 billion. Yet you will hear people come to the Sen-ate floor and say that is a cut and that we are slashing Medicaid. It is nothing of the kind. To me, the choice is clear. Do we want to continue with the failures of ObamaCare or do we want to do our very best to try to provide better choices and better options? Do we want to continue to allow the status quo, which is hurting families,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES3950 July 12, 2017 
putting a strain on doctors and our emergency rooms and hospitals like I mentioned in Lake Granbury or do we actually want to address the funda-mental flaws of our healthcare system? I wish we could do something perfect, but certainly with the constraints im-posed by the fact that our Democratic friends are not willing to lift a finger to help, and given the fact that we have to do this using the budget proc-ess—those are some pretty serious con-straints. We basically have to do this with one arm tied behind our back, but we are going to do the best we can be-cause we owe it to the people we rep-resent. I encourage our colleagues on both sides of the aisle to try to take a fresh look at this and figure out how we can be part of the solution, not just to compound the problem. There is one thing I haven’t men-tioned that I am particularly excited about in the Better Care Act; that is, for States like Texas that did not ex-pand Medicaid to cover able-bodied adults in the 100 to 138 percent of Fed-eral poverty level, in the Better Care Act, we provide them access to private health insurance coverage and access for the first time. About 600,000 Tex-ans—low-income Texans—who, for the first time under the provisions of this bill, will have access to a tax credit, and States, using the Innovation and Stability Fund and something called the section 1332 waivers, will be able to design programs which will make healthcare more affordable in the pri-vate insurance market. One reason people prefer the private insurance market to Medicaid is for the reason I mentioned earlier, that Medicaid reimburses healthcare pro-viders about 50 cents on the dollar compared to private health insurance. This actually will provide them more access to more choices than they have now, certainly. Certainly, for that co-hort of people between 100 percent of Federal poverty and 138 percent of Fed-eral poverty in those States that didn’t expand. I am excited about what we are try-ing to do here and its potential. Again, to stabilize the markets, which are in meltdown mode right now and we all know are unsustainable, our friends across the aisle will say: We will talk to you if you take all the reforms off the table, which translates to me: We will talk to you about bailing out a bunch of insurance companies but doing nothing to solve the basic under-lying pathology in the system. So we are going to do that in our bill, the Better Care Act. Secondly, we want to make sure that we do everything in our power to bring down premiums. I know the Presiding Officer cares passionately about this. This may well be the litmus test for our success. Under the discussion draft we released earlier, the CBO said that in the third year, you could see pre-miums as much as 30 percent lower, but we would like to see even more choices and premiums lower than that and more affordable. The third thing our Better Care Act will do is to protect people against pre-existing conditions. Right now, people sometimes refuse to or are afraid to leave their jobs in search of other jobs because, if they have preexisting condi-tions, then they cannot get coverage with the new insurance companies for a period of time. That is called the pre-existing condition exclusion. We would like to protect people against that eventuality so that people do not have to be worried about changing jobs or losing their jobs and losing their cov-erage. Fourth, as I have taken a few min-utes to talk about here today, we want to put Medicaid—one of the most im-portant safety net programs in the Federal Government—on a sustainable path, one that is fair to the States that expanded Medicaid under the Afford-able Care Act and to those that did not. I think any fair-minded person who is looking at what we have pro-posed here would agree with me that it is not perfect but that it, certainly, fits the name that we have ascribed to it. It is a better alternative than people have under the status quo. I urge all of our colleagues to work with us in good faith to try to improve it. Here is the best news of all, perhaps, to those who would have other ideas. We do have an opportunity to have an open amendment process, and some-times that does not happen around here. People say: Here it is. Take it or leave it. You cannot change it. All you can do is vote for it or vote against it. That is not what we are going to do. We are going to have an open amend-ment process. As long as Senators have the energy to stay on their feet and offer amendments, they can get votes on those amendments. I cannot think of a better way to reflect the will of the Senate and to come out with the very best product that we can under the circumstances. We are on a trajectory next week to begin this process and will have, prob-ably, some very late nights and early mornings come Thursday and Friday. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unan-imous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. REED. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment today to talk about the ongoing efforts by the Sen-ate Republicans to take away health insurance from millions of Americans by repealing the Affordable Care Act. I was here on the floor just a couple of weeks ago reading letters from my constituents about how they have ben-efited from the ACA and what TrumpCare would mean for them based on what we had seen of their bill so far. Since then, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have continued forging ahead in their effort to repeal the ACA, in spite of overwhelming opposition. Indeed, nearly every major healthcare organization representing patients, doctors, nurses, and hospitals, among others, is opposed to this misguided ef-fort, and that is on top of the millions of Americans who know firsthand how devastating TrumpCare would be for them and their families. Senate Republicans are working on tweaks to convince their colleagues to vote for this disastrous bill. Unfortu-nately, their so-called ‘‘fixes’’ are not improvements. That is because, in my view, TrumpCare is fatally flawed and cannot be fixed. My constituents know better and have continued to write and call—even stopping me in stores and on the streets—to express their opposition and fear, quite frankly, of all versions of the Senate TrumpCare bill. For example, my Republican col-leagues are looking to add a provision that would bring us back to the days when insurance companies could deny coverage or charge exorbitant amounts for those with preexisting conditions. The Affordable Care Act ended this practice once and for all, we hope, and I can’t imagine why my colleagues want to bring back those discrimina-tory policies. However, the amend-ments that several Senators have pro-posed would do just that. They would allow insurance companies to sell plans on the marketplace with no protec-tions for those with preexisting condi-tions, which would create a death spi-ral in the marketplace, so that the very people who need health insurance the most would be priced out entirely. Just last week, I heard from Anne in North Smithfield, RI, about this very issue. Anne said: 
I am the parent of a childhood cancer sur-vivor. The last 11 months of my life have been fighting alongside my warrior, my hero, my 9-year-old osteosarcoma survivor, Julia. She loves unicorns, horses, the beach, and going for walks. Due to no fault of her own, she hasn’t been able to walk for the past 11 months. I am writing to ask for your support to en-sure that all children fighting cancer have access to affordable, quality healthcare. If enacted into law, the current proposal for the healthcare bill will have devastating im-pacts on the hundreds of thousands affected by childhood cancer. Without quality health insurance and access to treatment, my child would not have survived. 
Anne went on to explain that the Re-publican efforts to undermine pre-existing conditions protections would be devastating for childhood cancer survivors. Even parents who get their insurance through their employer would be at risk. Anne pointed out that nearly half of families of children with cancer will experience gaps in coverage because one or both parents often need to stop working or reduce their hours to care for the child. Further, TrumpCare erodes other critical consumer protections by allow-ing annual and lifetime limits on care.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S3951 July 12, 2017 
Anne continues her message: 
Additionally, childhood cancer patients must be assured of access to essential health benefits without the threat of lifetime or an-nual caps that would effectively price pa-tients out of lifesaving treatments. Two- thirds of childhood cancer survivors will de-velop serious health conditions from the tox-icity of treatment. My child’s future is al-ready uncertain enough. We should not have to worry about annual or lifetime caps on coverage. 
I agree with Anne. What use is healthcare coverage that expires just when you need it the most? Why would anyone think it makes sense to sell a health insurance policy for thousands of dollars that doesn’t actually cover anything—or nothing—when you need it? This is a step in the wrong direc-tion, and I continue to urge my Repub-lican colleagues to reverse course. I would also like to talk about what this bill would do to those suffering from opioid addiction, a public health crisis that has taken a tremendous toll on our country and particularly on my home State of Rhode Island. I, along with many of my Democratic colleagues, have been talking about how the Senate TrumpCare bill would pull the rug out from many of those who are suffering from substance use disorders, like opioid addiction, by decimating Medicaid, which is how many people suffering from the opioid crisis access treatment. News reports suggest that Repub-licans are considering adding a fund for opioid addiction treatment as another so-called fix to the TrumpCare bill. While we absolutely need more Federal funding to expand access to drug treat-ment—in fact, I have been urging Re-publican leaders to do just that for years—what they are proposing cannot make up for the bill’s nearly $800 bil-lion in cuts to Medicaid with a $45 bil-lion opioid fund. The math simply doesn’t work. Second, short-term drug treatment programs do not provide a full spec-trum of healthcare coverage over the long term, like Medicaid or other health insurance coverage. The Med-icaid expansion under the ACA has pro-vided the security of reliable healthcare coverage and long-term sta-bility to help people with chronic con-ditions such as substance use disorders seek treatment and turn their lives around. TrumpCare takes that away. In addition, people with opioid addic-tion suffer from other mental health conditions at twice the rate of the gen-eral population and higher rates of physical health conditions as well, which would still go unaddressed in this so-called fix. We will be setting people up for failure if we provide im-mediate drug treatment services but cut access to the other mental and physical healthcare services they need. An opioid fund alone will not solve this public health crisis and, in fact, would be a drop in the bucket com-pared to how the rest of this bill would worsen the crisis. The cuts to Medicaid under the Sen-ate TrumpCare bill are beyond repair. The Senate TrumpCare bill fundamen-tally changes the structure of the Med-icaid Program, making massive cuts, representing a 35-percent cut over the next two decades. Simply put, this will end the Medicaid Program as we know it, which will hurt not only those suf-fering from the opioid crisis but also seniors, children, and people with dis-abilities. We may see Republicans try to spread out this harm over more years to hide the damage, but do not be fooled. Whether they make massive cuts to Medicaid in 2021 or 2022 or even 2026, for that matter, the cuts will be devastating. In short, no fix can undo the damage this bill will cause. This bill is a mas-sive tax break for the wealthiest Amer-icans at the expense of everyone else. No amendment or tweak to the bill will change that. Sharon from Wakefield, RI, wrote to me just a couple of days ago and summed this up very well. She said: 
I do not support the so-called American Health Care Act because it is not a health care plan, it is a tax cut for the rich. I am 67 years old, and I have a mild version of mus-cular dystrophy, and I have Medicaid. Since the GOP wants to end Medicaid, I am asking you to vote NO on the bill. 
Republicans must abandon this effort and come to the table to work with Democrats on a new path forward. Let’s have productive conversations about how we can improve access to care and bring down costs. Let’s har-ness this interest in improving access to drug treatment and work together on those efforts. But, coupled with the TrumpCare bill, those efforts will not mitigate the damage this bill will in-flict on my constituents and those across the country. I hope those on the other side of the aisle who have expressed misgivings will oppose TrumpCare in all of its forms so that we can work together on a bipartisan solution and attempt to do something positive for our constitu-ents. With that, Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. WHITEHOUSE.

CLIMATE CHANGE  
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, there was an interesting press con-ference earlier today in which I joined with Senator H
EITKAMP , Senator C AP-
ITO, and Senator B ARRASSO on a com-mon piece of legislation that will help address climate change. That does not happen often, so it was a good sign. This is not a comprehensive solution. It may not even make much of a meas-urable difference, but it will make some difference. It will help drive America’s technological edge, and it will help, as it gets implemented, re-duce our carbon emissions. It was very good to be working with those Sen-ators. The fundamental problem we face with carbon capture and utilization and the reason so little of it now hap-pens is economics. There is a flaw in the market economics related to car-bon capture utilization and sequestra-tion. Here is the flaw: There is no busi-ness proposition for stripping out the carbon dioxide, and in a market econ-omy, if no one will pay for something, you don’t get very much of it. LINDSEY GRAHAM and I flew up to Saskatchewan to see Boundary Dam, a carbon capture plant at a coal-powered electric generating facility where they are removing the carbon dioxide by running the exhaust from the plant through, essentially, a cloud of aminos. They are able to sequester closing on 80 percent of the carbon, and they use it to pump out and into nearby oil fields to pressurize the oil to facilitate ex-traction. Up in Saskatchewan at Boundary Dam, they have proved that the technology works, and where they are, with a little financing help from the Province, the economics work also. Unfortunately, not every coal-burn-ing plant is on an oil field where the carbon dioxide can be used for extrac-tion. Other than the facility in Sas-katchewan, there is not a lot going on, on this continent. The Illinois facility collapsed, the facility in the South just collapsed, and there is one in Texas that is going on. But the bill the four of us got together on—which would be to create a tax credit paid for each ton of carbon that is captured and utilized or sequestered—could really make a difference. Knowing those credits are out there is the kind of reliance indus-try needs in order to invest in the tech-nologies to make this happen. Of course, a real market for carbon reduction technologies ultimately re-quires putting a price on carbon emis-sions. We can fiddle around with pay-ments for reduced carbon, but ulti-mately a price on carbon is the sensible economic solution. I think that is pret-ty much universally agreed by econo-mists. Everyone agrees that carbon di-oxide emissions are not a good thing. Everyone also agrees that carbon diox-ide emissions are free to emitters now, so we get a lot of them. A harmful thing that is free to the emitter is called, in economic terms, an externality. It is an externality be-cause the cost of the harm is external to the price of the product. A basic tenet of market economics is that the cost of a harm should be built into the price of the product that causes the harm. It is basically an economic version of being polite. If you throw your trash over into your neighbor’s yard instead of paying for your trash collection, well, your neighbor has to clean up

In essence, that is what the fossil fuel industry has been doing with their carbon dioxide emissions for years—not paying to clean them up, dumping them all into our common atmosphere and our common oceans, making their neighbors pay because they don’t want to pay for their own waste. Like that bad neighbor, they have come up with various excuses: Oh, it would be too expensive for us to pay for our trash collection. Or, our trash is actually good for your yard; it kind of composts it a bit. You will love it. It is better for you to clean it up. Then there is my personal favorite: If you make us take care of our own waste, we will beat you up—politically, at least, which is why the fossil fuel in-dustry spends so much money on poli-tics, just to be able to make that threat credible. And around here, boy, is it credible. It explains virtually fully our failure as an institution to address this patently obvious problem that our own home State universities are telling us is real. From Utah to Rhode Island, the universities we support and root for know and teach climate science. Anyway, I have a carbon price bill that would cause a technological boom in carbon capture and carbon utiliza-tion because, at last, there would be a reason to pay for it, and the free mar-ket could get to work. American inge-nuity could get to work. With that market signal and with funding from revenues that the fee would generate, we could actually extend the life of ex-isting coal plants being shuttered by competition from natural gas, by strip-ping their carbon dioxide emissions so that they actually didn’t do the dam-age that they are doing now, they stopped throwing their trash into their neighbors’ yard, and they paid for trash collection. The technology needs to be there and the economics need to be there, and then it can be done. We really ought to pass the carbon fee bill. I would add that the carbon fee bill also creates a lot of revenue. We, I think, have agreed that revenue ought not go to fund the government—not to make Big Government—but there are other things we can do with it that would be very helpful. One would be to make coal country whole for the eco-nomic losses coal country has sus-tained. Remember Huey Long’s old slogan: ‘‘Every man a king.’’ We could make every miner a king—with a solid pen-sion, retirement at any time, full health benefits for life for the family, a cash account based on years worked, a voucher for a new vehicle, a college plan for their kids. It all becomes do-able if we pass a carbon fee and use the revenues to help coal country. Other-wise, nothing will change. Coal country will just keep suffering as natural gas keeps driving coal out of the energy market. There is no mecha-nism now to remedy that inevitability. People will suffer. There is a remedy right there—a carbon fee—that can help fund and encourage the develop-ment of the technologies so that we can strip the carbon dioxide out of the emitting powerplants and so that we can go into these coal countries where pensions and benefits have been stripped by bankruptcy, by the collapse of this industry, and make those folks whole again. Give them their dignity. Let them re-tire now. It is not their fault that the coal industry has collapsed. They worked hard. They did dangerous work. They went down in the mines. They worked big equipment. It is a dan-gerous occupation to be a coal miner, and it is entitled to respect. Retire any time, full health benefits for you and the family, a cash account to help, a new vehicle voucher, a college plan for the kids, to make sure they are well- educated—you could do a lot of those things. You could help those people pass a carbon fee and make every coal miner a king. In the meantime, I am willing to find funding to flip the social cost of car-bon—the way we did in our bill, an-nounced today—and create a positive fee, a tax credit for carbon capture and carbon utilization. I am willing to work with Republican colleagues to find a way to pay our nuclear fleet for the carbon-free nature of its nuclear power. It is crazy to be closing safely oper-ating nuclear power facilities just be-cause they get zero economic value for the carbon-free nature of their power. The carbon-free nature of their power has value. The carbon-free nature of power has significant value. That is why we are offering in our legislation a tax credit of $30 to $50 per avoided ton of carbon dioxide emissions. That im-plies that an avoided ton of carbon di-oxide emissions is worth $30 to $50. If nuclear power avoids that, I am willing to work with my Republican colleagues to figure out a way so that our nuclear fleet can enjoy the actual economic advantage of the carbon-free power they produce. We close a nuclear plant so we can open a natural gas plant which pollutes more than the nuclear plant because the economics are so fouled up that the nuclear plant gets no value for carbon- free power and the natural gas plant pays no costs for the harm of its car-bon emissions. It is economic madness. We know that carbon-free nature has value. We know that the carbon-free nature of nuclear power has value. We just will not pay for it, and plants close due to that market failure, and jobs are lost, and power is lost, and new in-vestments have to be stood up in pol-luting plants to make the difference. It is crazy. In closing, the Heitkamp-White-house-Capito-Barrasso bill, the FU-TURE bill, to provide a tax credit for carbon capture utilization and seques-tration in powerplants, in factories, and in a variety of applications, is small. It is in some respects a gesture, but everything begins with small steps and small gestures. I am proud to be a part of it, but I want to remind my col-leagues that there are also big win-win ways that we can solve the larger prob-lem. I look forward to working to-gether to accomplish just that. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I ask unan-imous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

CALLING FOR THE RELEASE OF LIU XIAOBO  
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I stand here today on behalf of a hero of free-dom and democracy in the People’s Re-public of China. Liu Xiaobo and his wife Liu Xia are the faces of liberty in China. They have sacrificed comfort and normalcy to chart a path toward political liberalization. For that, they have been detained, imprisoned, and abused. In 2008, Liu Xiaobo coauthored ‘‘Charter 08,’’ a manifesto that shined a light on the Communist Party of China and its totalitarian abuse of power. Though many brave souls signed their names and their fates to that docu-ment, Dr. Liu’s name was at the very top. For this reason, he received the Nobel Peace Prize. He also received charges of ‘‘inciting subversion of state power’’ and an 11-year prison sentence. It is impossible to neglect the stark irony: a man dedicated to nonviolence, imprisoned for promoting peace. Motivating Dr. Liu’s tremendous courage and self-sacrifice was a deter-mination to remember what the Peo-ple’s Republic of China desperately wants the world to forget: Tiananmen Square. A poet, author, and political scientist, Dr. Liu was, in 1989, a vis-iting scholar at Columbia University, but when the pro-democracy protests broke out in Beijing in June of that year, he raced back to China to support them. He staged a hunger strike in Tiananmen Square in the midst of the historic student protests and insisted that they would remain nonviolent in the faces of the tanks, which the Chi-nese military deployed to smash them. In 1996, the party subjected him to 3 years of ‘‘reeducation through labor’’ for continuing to question China’s one- party system. In 2008, on the eve of the 100-year an-niversary of China’s first Constitution and the 30-year anniversary of Beijing’s Democracy Wall movement, Dr. Liu dedicated his work on ‘‘Charter 08’’ to the martyrs at Tiananmen Square. Today, 8 years into his unjust impris-onment, Dr. Liu needs our help more than ever. Last month, it was revealed that Dr. Liu has contracted an aggres-sive, late stage form of liver cancer. Although PRC authorities ‘‘released’’ him ‘‘on medical parole,’’ both Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia linger without free-dom. Even worse, Liu Xiaobo is dying.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S3953 July 12, 2017 
His condition is critical, and we are running out of time to act on his be-half. Although Chinese authorities com-pelled the Lius to sign an affidavit al-legedly attesting to their satisfaction with the medical care they have re-ceived in China and their wish to re-main there, Liu Xia has communicated to their attorney their desire to spend Liu Xiaobo’s final days in America. PRC doctors insisted that Dr. Liu was too ill to travel, but medical experts from the United States and Germany— one of them being Dr. Joseph Herman of the MD Anderson Cancer Center of the University of Texas—visited Dr. Liu and attested to the contrary. Issuing a joint statement, they agreed that Dr. Liu ‘‘can be safely transported with appropriate medical evacuation care and support.’’ They then issued this stark warning: ‘‘However, the medical evacuation would have to take place as quickly as possible.’’ The urgency of this situation goes beyond Liu Xiaobo. Liu Xia’s liveli-hood is inextricably linked to the abil-ity of the two of them to leave China. Due to his imprisonment, Liu Xiaobo has been unable to receive his $1.5 mil-lion in prize money from the Nor-wegian Nobel Committee. The holdup of transferring the funds is merely rou-tine: a signed form from Dr. Liu and an open bank account with his name on it. But China has prevented these tech-nical steps from progressing. If Liu Xiaobo dies without receiving this ac-count, Liu Xia will be left destitute with no money. I shudder to think what a life would hold for the wife of China’s boldest political prisoner. Only one man stands between a dying man’s wish and his wife’s livelihood and freedom: Xi Jinping. Although no one action can undo the turmoil that the Lius have suffered over the past 28 years, it is not too late to do the right thing and to allow this man and his wife to spend their last days together according to their wishes. It wouldn’t be the first time that Xi has made a similar decision. Earlier this year, he agreed, after consulta-tions with the Trump administration, to release an imprisoned Houstonian, Sandy Phan-Gillis, who was incarcer-ated on false charges. Although noth-ing could bring back the 2 years of sep-aration from her family, she and her family are now reunited—something I spent considerable time urging and en-couraging and was grateful to see come to pass. Lest Xi forget, even Kim Jong Un, the dictator in North Korea, allowed Otto Warmbier, a young American col-lege student from Ohio—in the prime of his life before torture and abuse left him in a coma—to return home for his final hours. Surely, Xi can show the same degree of humanity shown by Kim Jong Un. Indeed, toward that end, the bill that I have introduced numerous times to rename the street in front of the Chi-nese Embassy in honor of Liu Xiaobo is an instrument of leverage that can help produce his freedom. In 2015, I came to this floor and asked on three separate occasions for unanimous con-sent to pass my bill to rename the street in front of the Chinese Embassy after Liu Xiaobo. Over and over again, sadly, Democratic Senators stood up and objected, stymieing the effort. Each time I advocated on behalf of Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia, my colleagues ex-pressed procedural concerns: This is counterproductive. Doing so will only antagonize China. Well, some of us are less concerned about antagonizing Chinese Com-munist dictators. My fellow Senators assured me that they have negotiated the release of many political prisoners behind the scenes. Well, that is wonderful, and I encourage them to do so now in the few days and weeks Liu Xiaobo has ahead. Even so, despite repeated Democratic objections—repeated Democratic ob-structionism—ultimately, the U.S. Senate was able to pass my bill by voice vote in the 114th Congress, and the reason at the time was evident: China’s stubbornness—wrongly impris-oning a Nobel Peace laureate—required public action to force the issue. The end goal should be clear. It is not mere-ly to rename a street, but rather to use the action to shine light on the Lius and to pressure the PRC to do the right thing. No Member can explain the success of this tactic better than my good friend Senator G
RASSLEY , the senior Senator from Iowa, who led a very similar ef-fort in 1984 to rename the street in front of the Soviet Embassy after Andrei Sakharov, the famed Soviet dis-sident. Senator G
RASSLEY led that ef-fort under Ronald Reagan, and when the street was renamed, it meant any-time a Soviet had to write to their Em-bassy, they had to write Sakharov’s name. It meant anytime you had to pick up the phone and call the Em-bassy and say ‘‘Where exactly do I find this Embassy?’’ they had to address and highlight the dissident. For the PRC, they do not want to highlight Liu Xiaobo because he is a powerful voice for freedom and against tyranny. Just as it worked against the Soviet Union, as Reagan demonstrated, public shaming, shining light, telling the truth can bring down the machin-ery of oppression. So, too, can public shaming—shining light—secure Dr. Liu’s freedom. As we stand here today, we don’t know if Xi is going to allow Dr. Liu to come to freedom, to live out his last days in peace, and to receive the Nobel Peace Prize that he was so justly awarded. If Xi does the right thing, we can all commend the action. But if not, I am announcing my intention to con-tinue to press this bill, to seek its pas-sage again in this Congress, just as the Senate passed it in the prior Congress. I intend to press forward and seek pas-sage of this bill. If Dr. Liu is not released—if he dies in China, still under their oppression— I intend to continue to fight until the day when the street is named in front of the Embassy and the Chinese Com-munists can bow their heads in shame at their injustice. If they don’t want to be publicly shamed, there is an easy path: Don’t commit shameful acts. Truth has power. Sunshine and light have power. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle—Republicans and Democrats: If there is an issue that should unite us all, it is that a Nobel Peace laureate speaking out for peace and democracy should not be wrongly imprisoned in Communist China. That should bring us together—and the full force of the United States. I commend President Trump for lead-ing on this issue, and I am hopeful that China will see its way to doing the right thing. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. TILLIS ). The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. M
CCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. 
GETTING OUR WORK DONE  
Mr. M CCAIN. Mr. President, as we know, yesterday the majority leader announced that he plans to delay the start of the August recess by 2 weeks. He stated that this delay is necessary in order to ‘‘complete action on impor-tant legislative items and process nominees that have been stalled by a lack of cooperation from our friends on the other side of the aisle.’’ Those are the majority leader’s words. I have no problem with the leader’s decision. I will happily stay here an ad-ditional 2 weeks. I will stay 3, 4, or even 5 weeks as long as we have a plan to address the serious issues that face this Nation. My friends, when the Senate com-pletes its work this week, we will have considered a whopping total this entire week of three nominations, one of them being a noncontroversial district judge nominee on which the majority leader was forced to file cloture. That cloture vote was unanimous, 97 to 0. Yet we were still forced to burn postcloture time—30 hours—before being allowed to vote earlier today on his confirmation—a vote that was again unanimous at 100 to 0. What? That is the way we are doing business in the Senate? I will repeat. The vote to stop debate was 97 to 0 after 30 hours. After we burned 30 hours, then we were allowed to vote earlier today— a vote that was again unanimous at 100 to 0. Why? We have a war on. We have men and women in harm’s way. We have nomi-nees stacked up, and so we are spend-ing an entire week with three nomi-nees. So with an incredible act of an-other chapter in ‘‘Profiles in Courage,’’ rather than say, OK, we will stay here

Friday, we will stay here Saturday, we will stay here Sunday, but by God we are going to do the people’s business— we are not doing the people’s business. I can’t go through all the machina-tions between the Democratic leader and our majority leader, and I can’t go through all the tos and fros and all of that, but I am supposed to go back and speak to a high school civics class and say: I am happy to be here. I have had a very tough week this week in the Senate, my young friends who may want to be engaged in public service someday, and we voted on a district judge 97 to 0. Thirty hours later, we were allowed to vote on his nomina-tion, and the vote was 100 to 0. That is what the Senate is supposed to do? There was no reason why we needed to take 3 days on this nominee. I say to my friend the Democratic leader and I say to the Republican leader: This type of obstruction has gone on long enough, and it has to stop. As I said, I am happy to stay here for the entire August recess to do the work the American people sent us here to do, but we must first have a plan of what we are going to do and how. What are we to say to the American people if we stay here for several weeks, have no legislative plan, and accomplish noth-ing? We have been in for 6 months now. What have we done? We have done Gorsuch, and we have done Gorsuch, and we have done Gorsuch, and we have repealed some regulations—all of it with my party in control of all three branches of government. I am not proud to go back to Arizona and talk about that record of nonaccomplish-ment. Right now, we have no consensus on how to repeal and replace the failed policies of ObamaCare. I can’t tell you the number of hours I have heard the same arguments go around and around and around and around. As far as I know, there is no consensus on how to best fund the government, no plan to do a bipartisan budget deal, and no path forward on appropriations bills. This is disgraceful. What I am asking for is simple. If we are going to stay here to work, then let’s get some work done. Why aren’t we working now? Why aren’t we work-ing tonight? There are nominees in the Department of Defense who are before this body, and we are in a war, and what are we doing? We are doing a vote on a district judge that we took 30 hours—30 hours—to discuss. If we are going to stay here, let’s get the work done. Let’s come in early, stay late, negotiate a healthcare bill, and process nominations to make sure the administration is adequately staffed so the executive branch can function. Let’s renew FDA user fees to streamline the regulatory process for lifesaving prescription drugs. Let’s fund the Veterans Choice Program to ensure our veterans are able to access care in their communities. Let’s ad-dress the debt limit before we default on our payments. Let’s debate, amend, and pass the fiscal year 2018 National Defense Authorization Act. Perhaps, most importantly, let’s get to work on the budget so we can begin moving in-dividual appropriations bills to fund the government and not have to resort to a continuing resolution or omnibus. To those who may be watching, the fact is that a continuing resolution and an omnibus means that we have two choices—yes or no. We don’t have an amendment. We don’t have a way to improve it. We are talking about tril-lions of dollars, but we are going to wait until we are right at the edge of the cliff, and then my distinguished friends and leaders on both sides will say: You have to vote aye; you have to vote aye because the government is going to be shut down. I am tired of that choice. We know it is coming. We know the cliff is here. So what did we do this week? We spent 30 hours dis-cussing a district judge—30 hours de-bating a district judge. Is that the right use of American taxpayers’ dol-lars? Have we no shame? The Senate Armed Services Com-mittee successfully reported out the fiscal year 2018 National Defense Au-thorization Act 27 to 0, supporting $650 billion for the base budget for national defense and an additional $60 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations. At these levels, the national defense budg-et would be $91 billion above the Budg-et Control Act spending cap. To put it another way, there was unanimous, bi-partisan support for an increase in de-fense spending of the Budget Control Act, capped by more than a quarter of this body—more than a quarter of this body, on both sides of the aisle. In one sense this consensus isn’t surprising because after years of budget cuts under the BCA sequestration, our mili-tary faces a serious crisis. As we ask them to do more and more in an in-creasingly dangerous world, Congress has failed to provide our men and women in uniform with the training, resources, and capabilities they need. I will repeat that. Congress has failed to provide our men and women in uni-form with the training, resources, and capabilities they need. However, simply passing an author-ization bill at higher defense spending levels will not solve the funding prob-lems for our military. We know we must pass a bipartisan budget deal to undo the Budget Control Act caps and set an agreed upon budget top line to allow the appropriations bills to move forward. Absent a bipartisan budget deal, we will be stuck with another continuing resolution, which, I might add, will be below the BCA budget caps for defense, or, worse, we will be fac-ing—guess what—a shutdown of the government. Has it been that long since we had the last shut down? I have come to this floor several times already this year demanding that we start negotiating a budget deal. We are 2 months away from the start of the fiscal year. We know that a budget deal must be done. The failure to begin negotiations means we are knowingly driving toward an outcome that will fund our military at levels below the Budget Control Act caps. I don’t understand why we haven’t started. It is not because we think the BCA levels are acceptable. It is not be-cause we believe there is a way to re-sponsibly fund the government without adjusting the BCA caps. Even our lead-er, Senator M
CCONNELL , has publicly stated that we will need to adjust the caps. This leads me to believe that there is only one reason why we are stalling negotiations on a budget deal and forcing the government and our military to start the year on a ‘‘con-tinuing resolution’’ and that is one word, and that word is ‘‘politics.’’ The same tactic that the Democratic leader is employing on nomination stalling is being applied to a budget deal. I find that to be shameful. There is plenty of blame to go around. The White House has also been surprisingly absent. Their own budget submission asked for defense spending above the budget control caps and re-peal of the defense sequester, but none of that—none of that—is possible with-out negotiating a bipartisan budget deal. Yet we have heard nothing from the White House—nothing. Any budget deal that would pass both the House and Senate and be signed by the Presi-dent will be extremely difficult to ne-gotiate. That is why we should have started long ago, and we must start now. I have been ready and willing all year to begin working. My door and, I know, the majority of my colleagues’ doors are open to any Senator, Republican or Democrat, but what we really need is for a select group of key Members to come together with leadership’s bless-ings to begin negotiating. Unless and until this body gets to work on a bipartisan budget deal, we will continue down the path we have been on for years, lurching from crisis to crisis, with no strategy for how to meet our budget responsibilities or fund our national security needs. My friends, colleagues, and fellow Americans, we must summon the polit-ical courage to do the hard work the American people expect of us to do a budget the way we are supposed to—a budget that is sufficient to meet the complex threats of today’s world. Our brave servicemembers who are facing those threats every single day deserve no less. Finally, every year for many years now, I have taken my time on the Fourth of July to have the honor of spending that national holiday in Af-ghanistan with the men and women who are serving in the military with courage, sacrifice, and skill. As part of our activities there, we have a town-hall meeting with several hundred of the men and women in uniform who are serving. My friend L

who occasionally has a good idea—once every decade—asked the group: How many of you are here not for the first time? Almost everybody in that room raised their hand. He said: How many of you have been more than twice? Two-thirds of the men in that room raised their hand. He said: How many of you have been here multiple times? A good number of them raised their hand. The point is that they are out there serving time after time after time, away from their homes, away from their families, working more than maybe 2 weeks in August. And what are we doing? What are we doing for them? There are a lot of things they need, and there are a lot of things we need to give them. Yet, somehow, we can’t see our way clear—Republicans and Demo-crats—to sit down and do the right thing for these men and women—to do the right thing so they can win. We now have a new President, a new National Security Advisor, and a new Secretary of Defense. I don’t agree with this President very often, but I do know that this President is committed to rebuilding the military and a win-ning strategy. The strategy for the last 8 years has been ‘‘don’t lose.’’ I know that General Mattis and General McMaster are people who want to win, and they have a strategy to win, and we have to be of assistance to them to provide the men and women with what they need to win. So I ask my colleagues, with passion, that we sit down and figure out the budget deal, move forward with it, and not spend a week like we just spent this week with 30 hours in order to con-firm one district judge.

BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I wish to submit to the Senate the budget scorekeeping report for July 2017. The report compares current-law levels of spending and revenues with the amounts the Senate approved in the budget resolution for fiscal year 2017, S. Con. Res. 3. This information is nec-essary for the Senate Budget Com-mittee to determine whether budget points of order lie against pending leg-islation. The Republican staff of the Senate Budget Committee and the Con-gressional Budget Office, CBO, pre-pared this report pursuant to section 308(b) of the Congressional Budget Act (CBA). My last filing can be found in the RECORD on June 7, 2017. The informa-tion contained in this report captures legislative activity from that filing through July 10, 2017. Republican Budget Committee staff prepared tables 1 through 3 of this re-port. They remain unchanged since my last filing. In addition to the tables provided by Budget Committee Republican staff, I am submitting CBO tables, which I will use to enforce budget totals approved by the Congress. CBO provided a spending and revenue report for fiscal year 2017, which helps enforce aggregate spending levels in budget resolutions under CBA section 311. CBO’s estimates show that current- law levels of spending fiscal year 2017 are below the amounts assumed in the budget resolution by $303 million in budget authority and $6.4 billion in outlays. CBO also estimates that reve-nues are $1 million above assumed lev-els for fiscal year 2017, but $21 million below assumed levels over the fiscal year 2017–2026 period. Social Security levels are consistent with the budget resolution’s fiscal year 2017 figures. CBO’s report also provides informa-tion needed to enforce the Senate pay- as-you-go, PAYGO, rule. The Senate’s PAYGO scorecard currently shows in-creased deficits of $226 million over the fiscal year 2016–2021 and $227 million over fiscal year 2016–2026 periods. For both of these periods, outlays have in-creased by $201 million, while revenues decreased by $25 million over the 6-year period and $26 million over the 11-year period. The Senate’s PAYGO rule is en-forced by section 201 of S. Con. Res. 21, the fiscal year 2008 budget resolution. Finally, included in this submission is a table tracking the Senate’s budget enforcement activity on the floor. No budget points of order have been raised since my last filing. All years in the accompanying tables are fiscal years. I ask unanimous consent that the ta-bles be printed in the R

aIncludes the budgetary effects of enacted legislation cleared by the Congress during the 114th session, prior to the adoption o f S. Con. Res. 3, the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2017. 
bSections 193–195 of Division A of P.L. 114–254 provided funding, available until expended, for innovation projects and state re sponses to opioid abuse. CBO estimates that, for fiscal year 2017: The $20 million in discretionary budget authority provided by section 193 would result in an additional $5 million in outlays f or FDA innovation projects; The $352 million in discretionary budget authority provided by section 194 would result in an additional $91 million in outlays  for NIH innovation projects; The $500 million in discretionary budget authority provided by section 195 would result in an additional $160 million in outlay s for state response to opioid abuse. Consistent with sections 1001–1004 of P.L. 114–255, for the purposes of estimating the discretionary budget authority and outla ys for these provisions under the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Act of 1974 and the Bal- anced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, those amounts are estimated to provide no budget authority or outlays. 
cFor purposes of enforcing section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act in the Senate, the resolution, as approved by the Senate,  does not include budget authority, outlays, or revenues for off-budget amounts. As a result, current level does not include these items. 
dPeriodically, the Senate Committee on the Budget revises the budgetary levels in S. Con. Res. 3, pursuant to various provisions  of the resolution. The total for the Initial Senate Resolution shown below excludes $81,872 million in budget authority and $40,032 million in outlays assumed in S. Con. Res. 3 for non regular discretionary spending, including spe nding that qualifies for adjustments to discretionary spending limits pursuant to section 251(b) of the Bal- anced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO SUZY D EYOUNG ∑Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Suzy DeYoung from Cincinnati, recipient of the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Award for Out-standing Public Service. The Jefferson Awards Foundation was founded in 1972 by Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Sen-ator Robert Taft, Jr., and Sam Beard to power others to have maximum im-pact on the things they care about most. Suzy cares about helping her commu-nity and has a passion for good food. She was born to be a chef. Her father, Pierre Adrian, was head chef at the five-star Maisonette restaurant in Cin-cinnati and her grandparents were chefs in New York. She and her sister co-ran La Petite Pierre restaurant until Suzy split off to focus on La Soupe. Now, Suzy is more than a chef. She is a business owner, transportation man-ager, teacher, and a fundraiser. In response to growing childhood poverty rates and the fact that one- third of all food produced worldwide is either lost or wasted each year, Suzy DeYoung started La Soupe to close the gap between food waste and hunger. La Soupe rescues otherwise wasted produce to create delicious and highly nutritious meals for customers, non-profits, and food-insecure families. In 2016 alone, La Soupe rescued 125,000 pounds of food from going to the landfill and donated over 95,000 servings to people living in food insecu-rity. La Soupe partners with Kroger, Jun-gle Jims, Crosset Company, Sugar Creek, and various local organic farms who provide ingredients allowing La Soupe’s team of volunteer chefs to share their culinary magic turning res-cued produce into soup or sometimes stew or gumbo or a casserole to feed to people who are hungry. Suzy also spends time helping par-ents learn how to feed their kids and teaches weekly cooking classes at area schools, sending kids home with ingre-dients and recipes to cook for their families. In addition, she operates a re-tail ‘‘Soupe Shack,’’ where sales of the meals made from rich ingredients fuel donations to Cincinnati’s food-deprived individuals. An energetic social entrepreneur, Suzy has inspired chefs to create and give. She has inspired parents to pro-vide healthier options to their families, and she has also inspired kids to pursue culinary careers. I would like to congratulate Suzy DeYoung and thank her and all of the volunteers at LaSoupe for their dedica-tion to closing the hunger gap for so many in greater Cincinnati.∑

OF COLORADO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, July 12, 2017 Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and applaud Anthony Cer-vantes for receiving the Arvada Wheat Ridge Service Ambassadors for Youth award.

The dedication demonstrated by Anthony Cervantes is exemplary of the type of achieve-ment that can be attained with hard work and perseverance. It is essential students at all levels strive to make the most of their edu-cation and develop a work ethic which will guide them for the rest of their lives.

HONORING COLONEL RALPH L. SCHWADER 
HON. SAM GRAVES 
OF MISSOURI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, July 12, 2017 Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I proudly pause to recognize Colonel Ralph L. Schwader, Commander of the Missouri Air Na-tional Guard’s 139th Airlift Wing. Colonel Schwader has dedicated years of service to not only the people of Missouri, but in defense of the United States of America. It is with great honor that I take a moment to recognize Colonel Schwader today. On paper alone, Colonel Schwader is an in-credibly impressive man. His list of various commands, deployments, decorations and awards could fill volumes. However, what you will never see on paper are the people he has touched while on those deployments or com-mands. The lives he has touched while earn-ing those decorations and awards. Colonel Schwader may never know the lives he has saved delivering supplies to soldiers in the field while deployed for Operations Desert Shield, Iraqi Freedom, and Enduring Freedom, among many other deployments and service stations. The lives other airmen he saved through training provided under his command by the Advanced Airlift Training Center. He may never fully know the gratitude for aid he helped provide to other Missourians during a flood or tornado or internationally to Haiti fol-lowing the earthquake of 2010. It is on behalf of those people who haven’t been able to give their thanks, myself and everyone in the Sixth Congressional District that I give my deepest thanks to Colonel Schwader for his dedication and service. Mr. Speaker, I proudly ask you to join me in recognizing Colonel Ralph L. Schwader for his decades of service to Missouri, the Sixth Con-gressional District and to the United States of America. f 
RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF FALL-EN MISSISSIPPI ARMY STAFF SERGEANT (SSG) SCOTTIE LEE BRIGHT 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, July 12, 2017 Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I am humbled to rise today in memory of Army Staff Sergeant (SSG) Scottie Lee Bright who was killed on July 5, 2005, during Operation Iraqi Freedom. SSG Bright was killed when an im-provised explosive device detonated near his military vehicle during patrol operations in Baghdad. SSG Bright was assigned to the 3rd Squad-ron, 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment, Fort Car-son, Colorado. SSG Bright, a Jackson, Mississippi native, was a 1986 graduate of Lanier High School. SSG Bright joined the Army in 1991. His brother Willie Bright said SSG Bright loved the Army and especially younger soldiers. Willie said his brother was his hero. SSG Bright’s funeral was held on what would have been his 37th birthday. More than 200 people filled the New Ebenezer Baptist Church that day. Reverend Dan Day called the event a ‘‘homecoming celebration’’ be-cause Heaven was SSG Bright’s new address. SSG Bright’s wife, Carolyn, told those in at-tendance that her husband was a wonderful husband and father and loved by his family very much. At the funeral, Brigadier General (BG) Rob-ert Crear presented SSG Bright’s family with military awards including the Bronze Star and Purple Heart. During the graveside service at Autumn Woods Cemetery, a Mississippi Army National Guard honor guard played ‘‘Taps’’ He was also given a 21-gun salute. SSG Bright is survived by his wife, Carolyn and their children, Breshay Nicole and Scottie Lee Bright, Jr. SSG Bright gave the ultimate sacrifice to protect the freedoms we all enjoy. His service to our nation will not be forgotten. RECOGNIZING JULY AS DRY EYE AWARENESS MONTH DURING THE DECADE OF VISION 2010 THROUGH 2020 HON. PETE SESSIONS 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, July 12, 2017 Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, in 2009, I was proud to co-sponsor with my then-House col-league the Honorable Tammy Baldwin the successfully passed H. Res. 366, which des-ignated 2010 through 2020 as ‘‘The Decade of Vision.’’ Accompanied by the Senate’s suc-cessfully passed companion legislation S. Res. 209, these resolutions recognized the challenges to the vision health of our nation’s citizens as the population ages and the inci-dence of chronic diseases—such as diabe-tes—grows, causing eye disease and visual impairment. In the spirit of those resolutions, I am pleased to recognize July as Dry Eye Aware-ness Month. Dry eye, a growing global prob-lem that affects more than 30 million people in the United States alone, occurs when the eye does not produce tears properly or they are not of the correct consistency and evaporate too quickly. It can range from discomfort to a painful chronic and progressive condition that leads to blurred vision or even vision loss. Dry eye impacts our nation’s healthcare policy, as it is one of the most frequent causes of patient visits to eye care providers. Although past research supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and its Na-tional Eye Institute (NEI) on the causes of and treatments for the condition has identified age, sex, and gender as factors, it has now discov-ered ethnic and racial differences, and that dry eye impacts younger patients. This ‘‘equal op-portunity’’ disease can have many causes, in-cluding environmental exposure; side-effects from medications; eye surgery; eye lid dis-orders; immune system diseases such as Sjo¨gren’s syndrome, lupus, or rheumatoid ar-thritis; contact lens wear; cosmetic use; aes-thetic procedures; and an increasingly com-mon cause—staring at computer or video screens for too long without blinking. Many are calling dry eye the ‘‘Disease of the Millennials’’ due to its increased incidence in that popu-lation. Dry eye has also been a major issue for our brave soldiers who were engaged in Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Free-dom. The Veterans Administration reports that upwards of 70 percent of Traumatic Brain In-jury-exposed veterans have dry eye symp-toms. During the 2017 Dry Eye Awareness Month, the Tear Film & Ocular Surface Society’s Dry Eye Workshop II (TFOS DEWS II) Report will be published in The Ocular Surface Journal, updating the definition of dry eye and address-ing its greater impact on vision health—the first such re-examination since 2007. Report highlights will be presented at a July 12 Con-gressional Briefing, accompanied by a ‘‘Test

IN APPRECIATION OF THE SERVICE OF EDWARD A. BURRIER 
HON. EDWARD R. ROYCE 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, July 12, 2017 Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, as Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, I would like to take a moment to express my appreciation for an exceptional individual who has served this House with distinction for the last 18 years, Mr. Edward A. Burrier. Edward first started in my office interning at the Africa Subcommittee, which I then chaired. At the time, he was still in college at the Uni-versity of Mary Washington in Fredericksburg, Virginia. Each day he would make the long commute from Fredericksburg, just to volun-teer. He then took a job in my personal office in 1133 Longworth where he met his future wife, a fellow junior staffer, Gretchen. While I may have been unaware about their early dating, I was pleased to have the opportunity to attend their memorable wedding in Adare, Ireland in 2006. They now have a young son, William, and it has been a pleasure watching them grow personally and professionally. Edward eventually rose to the position of Committee Deputy Staff Director of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Over the years, Edward was essential in achieving so much, including efforts to prevent the proliferation of MANPADS to terrorists, and major legislation sanctioning the regimes of North Korea and Iran, which are dangerously pursuing nuclear weapons programs. He found a niche in track-ing international rogues, some of who are now behind bars for gun-running and creating may-hem, in part because of Edward’s efforts. He also produced important reports, including the path-breaking Gangster Regime: How North Korea Counterfeits United States Currency, still relevant today. And he wrote for me hun-dreds of Foreign Intrigue blog entries, some of the most captivating foreign policy writing in Washington. Everything he worked on became better. In the last Congress, the Committee succeeded in having 24 bills become public law. That’s a big number, and an impressive record. In short, Edward has been involved in all the major foreign policy issues of the day, helping to make our country safer and more pros-perous. Over my time in Congress, I have been for-tunate to have had several long-serving staff members. Edward has been part of this group, central to much of what I have been able to accomplish. Most recently, he helped manage what I believe to be the best committee staff in Congress. Edward is cool, calm, and collected. He is a genuinely good person. Edward was one of the most talented, com-petent, and dedicated staff members in the House. His skills and excellent judgment will serve him well as he transitions to a top posi-tion at the Overseas Private Investment Cor-poration. His many friends on the Hill, both Republicans and Democrats, wish Edward continued success. f 
TRIBUTE TO RYAN AND TODD AARHUS 
HON. ROD BLUM 
OF IOWA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, July 12, 2017 Mr. BLUM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor two brothers from the First District of Iowa on their retirement after their 31 years of service in the Iowa National Guard. Ryan and Todd Aarhus are a shining exam-ple of citizenship and servitude to our great nation. During their 31 years of service, both brothers were deployed. Todd served as part of Operation Enduring Freedom, and both brothers served in Operation Iraqi Freedom. Ryan and Todd have both had distinguished careers of service —not only have they served their country and state in the Iowa National Guard, but both also serve as Iowa State Pa-trol Officers, volunteer firefighters, and EMTs. Additionally, Todd also served on Governors Culver and Branstad’s State Security details. It is my pleasure to honor both Ryan and Todd Aarhus on their retirement and to thank them for their dedication and service to our community, the State of Iowa, and our nation.

COMMANDER MARK COONEY 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, July 12, 2017 Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and applaud Wheat Ridge Police Commander Mark Cooney for his dec-ades of service to the City of Wheat Ridge, Colorado. For thirty eight years, Commander Cooney has been active within the community and the police department serving constituents of Wheat Ridge. Commander Cooney started his career in 1979 after graduating first in his class at the Police Academy. Mark’s career has consist-ently shown his commitment to law enforce-ment and building community partnerships. His work as a Field Training Officer and later Detective showed his special acumen in inves-tigations, being recognized by the First Judi-cial District Attorney’s office as Investigator of the Year by solving a difficult burglary case. Mark was promoted to Sergeant, then Lieuten-ant, and finally serving as Commander—all the while excelling at investigations and as a leader in the department’s emergency man-agement planning. Mark has shown his thirst for learning by earning a Master’s of Criminal Justice degree from the University of Colo-rado, graduating from the Northwestern Uni-versity School of Staff and Command as well as graduating from the FBI National Academy. As the Chief of Police for the City of Wheat Ridge noted, Mark’s dedication exemplifies their vision statement of ‘‘Exceptional People Providing Exceptional Service.’’ His hard work and dedication every day to making the com-munity of Wheat Ridge a great place to live and work demonstrates his exemplary work as a police officer in Wheat Ridge. I extend my deepest thanks to Commander Cooney for his service to the community. Thank you for your continuous dedication to serving the people and the City Wheat Ridge, Colorado. f 
IN RECOGNITION OF THE 35TH AN-NUAL METRO DETROIT YOUTH DAY 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, July 12, 2017 Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the organizers and participants of the 35th annual Metro Detroit Youth Day. This annual event provides southeast Michigan youth with a day of fun, games and opportuni-ties to engage with local officials and role models. Originally started in 1981 to promote strong-er relations between residents of Detroit and the business community, Metro Youth Day has expanded significantly and now provides ap-proximately 35,000 Detroit-area children with a day of education and recreation on Belle Isle in the Detroit River. As the largest youth event in the State of Michigan, Metro Youth Day hosts over 360 organizations and 260 busi-nesses from Metro Detroit to provide partici-pants with opportunities to build connections with civic leaders and nonprofit groups. These include Grow Detroit Youth Talent, an organi-zation that provides summer jobs for young people in Detroit, as well as educational events by local community groups. Youth Day also offers college scholarships to several dozen graduating high school students each year. Metro Detroit Youth Day helps build a cul-ture of civic engagement while also providing important resources and educational re-sources to area youth. The event has received widespread acclaim, including a Point of Light Award from President George H.W. Bush, as well as a Michigan Governor’s Award on Physical Fitness for its promotion of physical activity and health. These accolades under-score the positive impact that Metro Youth Day has on the Detroit community. Addition-ally, the event has provided more than 1,800 college scholarships to graduating seniors since 1991, making it an important engine of opportunity for area youth. These efforts have helped create a stronger and more cohesive Detroit, and it is my hope that Metro Youth Day continues to grow and serve the Detroit area youth while promoting improved commu-nity relations in the coming years. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the organizers and participants of the 35th annual Metro Detroit Youth Day. The event provides important resources and opportunities for participants.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, July 12, 2017 Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the following people who have worked with me to achieve the Morley Nelson Snake River Birds of Prey National Conservation Area Boundary Modification Act of 2017 which was legislation I drafted and was included in the Fiscal Year 2017 Consolidated Appropria-tions Act. They each played a role in their own way and because of their help, the West is building critical energy infrastructure that will improve reliability and efficiency and also in-crease continuing conservation efforts while saving Idaho ratepayers money. Let me start by thanking Brian O’Donnell and Danielle Murray from the Conservation Lands Foundation. Their solution oriented atti-tude helped guide the success of this effort. I would also like to thank Rick Johnson, Craig Gehrke, Will Whelan, Kai Anderson, and Amelia Jenkins from the conservation commu-nity. I want to thank Jeff Malmen and his terrific team at Idaho Power, including Mark Stokes and Mitch Colburn who were there every step of the way to ensure the project recognizes conservation and saves Idaho ratepayers. Their friends at Rocky Mountain Power, in-cluding Pat Reiten, were also great partners. I would also like to thank the hard working men and women at the Bureau of Land Man-agement. Tim Murphy and his team in Idaho include Peter Ditton and Erin Curtis. Their work was instrumental throughout the entire Gateway West project and I thank them for their public service in Idaho. Additionally, I need to thank Governor Otter and his team of John Chatburn and Scott Pugurd for their diligent work. I also want to thank Senator RISCH and his staff members John Sandy, Darren Parker, and Melanie Steele. Thanks to Chairman B
ISHOP and the House Natural Resources Committee for their thoughtful consideration of the Gateway West legislation. Erica Rhoad and Aniela Butler were a huge help to guiding this legislation through Chairman T
OMMCCLINTOCK ’Ssub- committee. I want to thank Gregory Kostka, Lisa Daly, and Hank Savage at Legislative Counsel. They drafted and redrafted countless versions of this bill under tight deadlines. I would also like to thank the Senate and House Interior and Environment Appropria-tions Subcommittee Chairmen L
ISA MUR-
KOWSKI and K ENCALVERT along with their ranking members T
OM UDALL and B ETTY M
CCOLLUM . Their staff were relentless in guid-ing this agreement to the finish line and a spe-cial thanks is owed to Dave LesStrang, Betsy Bina, and Rita Culp for their efforts in finalizing the agreement in the Fiscal Year 2017 Con-solidated Appropriations Act. Finally, I want to thank my staff, Lindsay Slater, Jamie Neill, Nikki Wallace, and Craig Quarterman who helped in many different ways to ensure this was the best possible deal for my constituents in Idaho.

DOROTHY A. BURLEY 
HON. DONALD NORCROSS

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, July 12, 2017 Mr. NORCROSS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Dorothy A. Burley, a woman of strength, character and commitment, on the occasion of her 75th birthday. Ms. Burley is a friend, mentor, educator and inspiration to many across New Jersey’s First Congres-sional District and beyond. After receiving her Associate’s Degree in Human Services at Camden County College and her Bachelor’s Degree in Elementary Edu-cation at Glassboro State College (now Rowan University), Ms. Burley taught for 16 years at various Camden City schools, shap-ing young minds. Ms. Burley’s commitment to community con-tinued beyond the classroom when, in 1993, she made history by taking the oath of office as the first African American female municipal clerk in the City of Camden. Ms. Burley would go on to hold other posi-tions of distinction in the community, in both appointed and elected offices, including Com-missioner for the Camden County Board of Elections, Chairperson of the Housing Author-ity of the City of Camden, Chairperson of the Alcohol Beverage Control Board, President of ‘‘Girls on the Move’’ Youth Foundation, and a member of the National and Camden Edu-cation Association. Ms. Burley would also serve as director of human resources at CAMcare Health Corporation until her well-de-served retirement. Separate from her professional commit-ments, Ms. Burley has selflessly dedicated her time and talents to organizations that enhance the lives of Southern New Jersey constituents. Though she’s been honored and recognized for her many meaningful efforts, Ms. Burley is especially deserving of this special recogni-tion, as she continues her mission to inspire everyone she encounters. Mr. Speaker, for that reason and so many others, I ask you to join me in wishing this de-voted mother, grandmother, public servant, and mentor, Ms. Dorothy A. Burley, a very happy 75th birthday. f

LESLIE H. GALLAGHER, JR. 
HON. DONALD NORCROSS 
OF NEW JERSEY  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, July 12, 2017 Mr. NORCROSS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor retired U.S. Air Force Technical Sgt. Leslie H. Gallagher, Jr. of the Borough of Pine Hill, Camden County, in New Jersey’s First Congressional District, for his service to our nation and our community. Mr. Gallagher graduated from Overbrook Regional High School in 1976 and enlisted in the United States Air Force that same year. He would continue to serve in the Air Force until his retirement in 1997. During his years of service in the Air Force, Mr. Gallagher would hold many roles, including assignments in law enforcement, the financial office, and as load master for large military transport air-crafts. During his career, Mr. Gallagher served as a non-commissioned officer-in-charge of mili-tary pay operations at four different military bases, and as travel operations and deputy fi-nance officer, where his work was instru-mental in support of Operation Desert Storm. While stationed in Delaware and Oklahoma, Mr. Gallagher taught high school physical edu-cation to students and served as a high school basketball and track coach. After twenty one years of service to the Air Force, Mr. Gallagher would return to Pine Hill where he served as Vice Commander and ulti-mately as Adjutant of Pine Hill Post 286 of the American Legion. His commitment to his com-munity continued in his roles as chairman of the Environmental Commission of Pine Hill, Commissioner of Parks and Recreation, and secretary of the Planning and Zoning Board. Mr. Gallagher’s ongoing commitment to edu-cation is evidenced by his leadership positions on the Pine Hill Board of Education, as Pine Hill’s representative to the Camden County School Boards Association, as a delegate to the New Jersey State Board of Education, and as a Sunday school teacher at his church. After his retirement from Local 322 as an HVAC technician, Mr. Gallagher’s public serv-ice would continue through his employment with the Borough of Pine Hill, where he has become an invaluable resource to the commu-nity. Mr. Speaker, Technical Sergeant Leslie H. Gallagher, Jr. is a great American who exem-plifies the true meaning of leader, community servant, and patriot. I ask you to join with me and the constituents of Southern New Jersey in honoring this exceptional man.

INTRODUCTION OF A BILL TO DI-RECT THE JOINT COMMITTEE ON THE LIBRARY TO ACCEPT A STATUE DEPICTING PIERRE L’ENFANT FROM THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA AND TO PROVIDE FOR THE PERMANENT DISPLAY OF THE STATUE IN THE UNITED STATES CAPITOL 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, July 12, 2017 Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today I intro-duce a bill to direct the Joint Committee on the Library to accept a statue depicting Pierre L’Enfant from the District of Columbia and to provide for the permanent display of the statue in the United States Capitol. Pierre L’Enfant was born in France in 1754. He was an engineer and an architect, and he traveled to the United States to serve with the United States in the Revolutionary War. In March 1791, L’Enfant was hired to develop the design for the District of Columbia. L’Enfant’s design for the city was so remarkable that it remains and is cherished today in the nation’s capital and throughout this country. L’Enfant’s design envisioned a federal and residential city with diagonal streets propelling from Con-gress and the President’s home, beautiful bou-levards on local streets and neighborhoods, and open spaces for monuments, memorials and historical structures, all of which largely remain intact, protected as a historical treas-ure. In 2006, the residents of the District of Co-lumbia chose L’Enfant as one of the top ten Americans that have given distinguished serv-ice to the District, and the selection committee created by the D.C. Commission on the Arts and Humanities chose L’Enfant as the second statue from the District of Columbia to be placed in the United States Capitol. The Dis-trict’s first choice for a statue was Frederick Douglass, and I am pleased that the Douglass statue now sits in Emancipation Hall. Because the United States Capitol does not currently appropriately recognize the contributions of Pierre L’Enfant, and because D.C. residents and stakeholders chose L’Enfant as a distin-guished Washingtonian, this bill would require the Joint Committee on the Library to place the Pierre L’Enfant statue in the United States Capitol. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. f

Nattalie was born on September 7, 1999, and raised in Cherry Hill, New Jersey.

THE RETIREMENT OF LAKEWOOD CITY MANAGER HOWARD CHAM-BERS 
HON. ALAN S. LOWENTHAL 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, July 12, 2017 Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Speaker, Howard L. Chambers, who has served as the city man-ager of the City of Lakewood for more than four decades, has announced that he will be retiring from his role at the administrative helm of the city. Howard has served longer as city manager of the same city longer than any other city manager in California—this in a pro-fession where the average length of service in California cities is about seven years. A true ‘‘native son,’’ Howard is a lifelong member of the Lakewood community, growing up near Mayfair Park, going to neighborhood schools, even working at the local YMCA. After earning his degree at Cal State Long Beach, Howard interned at the City of Lake-wood for two years, handling youth services. He then went to work with the City of Rosemead as an assistant city manager. How-ard returned to Lakewood in 1972 in the role of an executive assistant to the city manager. In 1976, the same year he earned a Master of Arts degree in Planning and Administration from Pepperdine University, Howard was named acting city administrator and shortly thereafter hired to permanently fill the position. The city council later officially re-titled the po-sition as city manager. Always looking to push his skill level further, he earned a Master of Public Administration

degree from the University of Southern Cali-fornia in 1981 and was a Fellow of the Pro-gram for Senior Executives in State and Local Government at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government in 1988. In 2005, he completed a rigorous evaluation process and became a Credentialed Manager under the auspices of the International City/County Man-agement Association. Howard eventually served 34 years as Lakewood City Manager, retiring in 2011. However, within a year, the city council asked him to return to the role. He returned in 2012 and remained until his retirement this year. In total, his 41 years as city manager represent nearly two-thirds of the 63-year-old city’s en-tire existence. It is safe to say that the vast majority of the city’s 80,000 residents have known no one but Howard as city manager. During his tenure as Lakewood city man-ager, Howard managed the city’s largest pub-lic works project in its first 50 years: the $16 million improvement of the Lakewood Civic Center and construction of The Centre at Syc-amore Plaza. He later oversaw the $21-million expansion and modernization of the Lakewood Sheriff’s Station, the largest single project in the city’s history. The sheriff’s station expan-sion project was completed without a new tax, tax increase, or special assessment. None of this has gone unnoticed and on his watch, Lakewood has deservedly earned many awards for the quality of its services, its commitment to responsive government, and its innovations. Over his record-setting 40 years behind the city manager’s desk, Howard has become a respected leader among area city managers, always willing to take the time to share his professional experience with his colleagues on issues affecting Southern California, its resi-dents, and its infrastructure. Howard has also worked tirelessly and ef-fectively on ad hoc committees and coalitions to address federal, state, and local issues, and has never shied away from a principled battle. As a long-term member of the International City/County Management Association (ICMA), Chairman of the Southeast Los Angeles Coun-ty Municipal Management Group, the Cali-fornia Contract Cities Association, and a mem-ber of the League of California Cities’ City Managers Division, Howard has worked with elected and appointed city officials, legislators, regulators, the business community, residents, and others to achieve solutions to the critical issues affecting local governments. In addition to his public service, Howard has made community service a priority. His in-volvement includes the Lakewood Rotary Club, the Weingart-Lakewood Family YMCA, Lakewood Special Olympics, the American Heart Association, Su Casa Ending Domestic Violence, Lakewood Regional Hospital, Kris Kringle Charity Golf Tournament, and Project Shepherd. For his sustained excellence, he has been recognized throughout his career by a variety of organizations including ICMA, Harvard Uni-versity John F. Kennedy School of Govern-ment, California Jaycees, YMCA, Lakewood City Council, Lakewood City Employees Asso-ciation, and Su Casa Ending Domestic Vio-lence. Howard is considered a legend in the city management profession and is known for his ability to build working relationships with city staffers, civic leaders, and state legislators. He also is a role model for his peers. Known for his ‘‘teachable moments,’’ he has become a mentor and teacher to an entire generation of new city managers. He has been and will con-tinue to be passionate about local govern-ment, and his involvement in community activi-ties and achievements in public service have resulted in significant benefits to Lakewood and surrounding communities. I have truly appreciated the time I have spent working with Howard. He has a great sense of humor and even when we have dis-agreed, he is respectful and thoughtful. I will miss Howard’s leadership and his guidance.

The Public Policy Institute of California was founded in San Francisco in 1994 by a trio of California visionaries seeking to provide our state with a world-class political think tank Since then, PPIC has lived up to its mission of ‘‘informing and improving public policy through independent, objective, non-partisan research.’’ By 2007, PPIC had opened a sec-ond office in Sacramento, enabling its team of experts to operate in the heart of California’s state government. PPIC boasts a staff of 75 people, including experts in economics, demography, political science, sociology, and environmental re-sources. It focuses on a wide range of con-cerns and opportunities facing our state, in-cluding higher education, water issues, and government investment strategies. Addition-ally, PPIC conducts surveys of voters and constituents to provide lawmakers with elec-tion statistics, approval ratings, and public opinion. Utilizing its unparalleled access to survey data and predictive analytics, PPIC seeks to understand the forces that drive soci-etal change in the long term, which helps in-form the political short term. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to pay tribute to the Public Policy Institute of California’s Sac-ramento Center as it celebrates the 10th anni-versary of its founding. I ask all my colleagues to join me in honoring PPIC’s dedication to providing California’s government with infor-mation and illumination. f 
COMMEMORATING THE BEGINNING OF THE DIAMOND JUBILEE FOR THE ISMAILI MUSLIM COMMU-NITY 
HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, July 12, 2017 Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the beginning of the Diamond Jubilee for the North Texas lsmaili Muslim community, and the broader Ismaili Muslim community across the world. On July 11, 1957, The Aga Khan became the 49th hereditary Imam of the Shia Imami Nizari Ismaili Muslims. In these past six dec-ades, the Aga Khan has guided the world’s 15 million Ismaili Muslims in both their spiritual and material lives, providing religious interpre-tation, ensuring their safety, and improving the quality of life for the community. While serving as the leader of the Ismaili Muslims, the Aga Khan has also played a major role in the philanthropic arena. The Aga Khan Foundation, established by the Aga Khan in 1967, works on projects such as dis-aster relief and historical restoration of cities and artifacts through the various programs in the Aga Khan Development Network. The AKDN along with its partners across the globe provides quality education and healthcare, along with promoting social and economic de-velopment to some of the world’s most impov-erished and isolated communities. The Ismaili Muslim community has contrib-uted greatly to the cultural diversification and economic development in North Texas. Their volunteers have served the North Texas com-munity by participating in local cleanups efforts after severe weather. The volunteers have also worked alongside other faith based groups and local nonprofits to provide meals to those who are less fortunate. Mr. Speaker, the Diamond Jubilee presents an opportunity to the Ismaili Muslim commu-nity to reaffirm their faith and serve the com-munities in which they live through various programs established by the Aga Khan. I con-gratulate the Aga Khan and the Ismaili Muslim community on this momentous milestone.

These are guiding principles that lead to success not only on the field, but will undoubt-edly resonate through every endeavor these valiant championship players undertake in their lifetimes. Among the individual team members to be congratulated are: Matthew Taylor, Cade McCarty, Clayton Ray, Sam Nortch, Wyatt Allen, Ryan McClellan, Cade Watson, Will Haley, Braden Thomas, Dillon Burris, Cole Reneau, Tyler Burris, Michael Badders, Devin Yates, Grayson Rodriguez, J’Kolvin Wallace, Rowan Arrant, and Jacob Miller. Their sportsmanship, humility, determina-tion, hard work, and skill are to be com-mended, admired, and emulated. The talented Blue Devils team was led to victory by an outstanding coaching and admin-istrative staff, including: Travis Jackson, Head Coach; Brett Thornell, Collin Wallace, & Na-than Williams, Assistant Coaches; Temple Rodriguez, Statistician; Kevin Herron, Athletic Director; David Russell, Principal; and Bryan Lee, Superintendent. Accolades must also be given to the play-ers’ families and the entire community of sup-porters who reside in Nacogdoches County, who embraced the fighting spirit which was evident in every team member throughout the season. Without these devoted fans’ support and encouragement, the Blue Devils’ road to the championship would have undoubtedly been much more arduous. It is with great pride that I join the constitu-ents of the First District of Texas in congratu-lating the players and athletic staff of the 2017 Class 3–A Champion Central Heights Baseball Team. Their legacy will endure as long as there is a United States of America.

CELEBRATING THE FIRST ATH-LETIC STATE CHAMPIONSHIP FOR MEYERSDALE AREA HIGH SCHOOL—A HISTORIC WIN FOR THE RED RAIDER BASEBALL TEAM 
HON. BILL SHUSTER 
OF PENNSYLVANIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, July 12, 2017 Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the achievements of the Meyersdale Area High School Varsity Baseball team of Meyersdale, Pennsylvania. The Red Raiders baseball team brought home the long awaited PIAA Class A State Championship on Thurs-day, June 15. This is a monumental moment for the school; it is the first state championship the school has won in any sport since its opening in the late 1940’s. In fact, this was the first PIAA crown earned by any team in the Somerset County school district. The Red Raiders defeated the Clarion Bobcats 2–0, fin-ishing their season with a record of 21–6. Baseball is a team sport, Mr. Speaker, and this championship is a team championship. The Red Raiders were led to victory against the Bobcats by their five seniors and captains, Riley Christner, Zach Hotchkiss, Max Caton, Cody Welker, and David Swank, and head coach Wayne Miller. This headlining win gave Wayne Miller an overall record of 183–44 dur-ing his ten years of coaching the Red Raiders. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to congratulate the players, coaches, and families of the Meyersdale Area High School Varsity Baseball team on their state championship. The pas-sion, commitment, and teamwork shown by these young men will surely follow them in their future endeavors as well as inspire the Meyersdale community for years to come.

ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOP-MENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS BILL REPORT LANGUAGE—ICE JAMS 
HON. GRACE MENG 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, July 12, 2017 Ms. MENG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my report language that was in-cluded in the Energy and Water Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill to prevent and mitigate flood damage associated with ice jams. I’d like to thank Chairman F
RELINGHUYSEN and Ranking Member L OWEY , as well as Chairman S
IMPSON , Ranking Mem-ber K
APTUR , and the entire subcommittee for their work on this bill. I offer a special thank you to the Energy and Water subcommittee staff for working with me to include this necessary language to en-courage the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to pursue projects to prevent and mitigate flood damage associated with ice jams in regions comprised of cities whose historic flooding has been caused predominantly by winter snowmelt and ice floes. Every year, flooding that results from the pil-ing up of frozen ice in rivers across the United States costs our economy millions of dollars. When free-floating ice catches on obstruc-tions, such as bridge pilings, rocks, or logs, flooding can result upstream from the block-age and, again, downstream when the ice fi-nally releases. During my time in the New York State As-sembly, I can remember hearing horrible sto-ries from my colleagues in upstate New York and wondering what more could be done to prepare for these events. In my home state of New York, the Mohawk River Basin is particularly susceptible to flood-ing associated with ice jams. I am pleased that the bill encourages the Army Corps to pursue projects and technologies to mitigate the damage caused by flooding associated with ice jams in areas, like the Mohawk River Basin, that truly need this support. I appreciate the time today to highlight this problem, and I thank my colleagues for their support on this issue. f

TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, July 12, 2017 Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in memory of Marine Corporal (Cpl.) Clifton Blake Mounce, who paid the ulti-mate sacrifice while defending our nation on July 14, 2005, during Operation Iraqi Free-dom. Cpl. Mounce was killed when his vehicle was struck by an improvised explosive device while he was conducting combat operations near Trebil, Iraq. Cpl. Christopher D. Win-chester was also killed. Cpl. Mounce was assigned to the 3rd Bat-talion, l0th Marine Regiment, 2nd Marine Divi-sion, II Marine Expeditionary Force (Forward). Cpl. Mounce, a Pontotoc native, graduated from North Pontotoc High School in 2000. His mother, Pat Mounce, says Blake loved playing football and baseball. In 2001 Blake enlisted in the United States Marine Corps following the terror attacks on 9/11. Pat says he joined be-cause he wanted to protect his three younger brothers; Shea, Winston, and Nate. ‘‘I’m real proud,’’ Pat said. ‘‘He said he had to go over there and fight or the enemy will be on our soil. I supported him 100 percent.’’ Additionally, Pat says her son was close to the end of his four years in the Marine Corps when he was deployed. An estimated 300 people came to the fu-neral which was held at West Heights Baptist Church in Pontotoc. Cpl. Mounce’s father, Johnny Mounce, read letters to the crowd that he received from his son shortly before his death. In the second letter read, Cpl. Mounce addressed each family member with a special message. Following the service, hundreds of cars were in the funeral procession. Residents lined the streets of Ecru waving American flags as some 200 cars drove by. The American flag was presented to Cpl. Mounce’s wife, Tiffany, during the graveside service at Ecru Cemetery. Cpl. Mounce’s fam-ily was given the Purple Heart medal. Cpl. Mounce is survived by his parents Johnny and Pat Mounce; wife Tiffany; brothers Shea, Winston, and Nate; and grandparents Flake and Dorothy Mounce. In 2013, the Blake Mounce Memorial Run for the Park 5K was started in Ecru in memory of this brave soldier who gave all to protect the freedoms we all enjoy. We will always re-member Cpl. Mounce’s sacrifice to protect our nation.

HON. PETE OLSON 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, July 12, 2017 Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, I’m proud to rep-resent one of the most diverse districts in America. Our diversity is an important part of what makes the greater Houston area such a unique example of the fabric of the American experience. The Ismaili Muslim community is a great contributor to Texas’ cultural richness and economic growth. I appreciate the Ismaili Mus-lim community’s engagement with the commu-nity as a whole, from public affairs to business to education. Sixty years ago today, the Aga Khan be-came the 49th hereditary Imam of the Shia Imami Ismaili Muslims. The role of the Imam is to interpret the faith to the community, as well as improve the quality and security of their daily lives. Aga Khan has accomplished this role with success and pride for many years. The Aga Khan emphasizes the view of the religion of Islam as a thinking, spiritual faith: one that teaches compassion and tolerance, promotes the role of intellect and upholds the dignity of a man, God’s noblest creation. I congratulate the Aga Khan on his Diamond Jubilee as Imam and wish both he and the U.S. Ismaili Muslim community continued suc-cess in their efforts to improve the lives of people around the world. f

The Hanover Park Police Department re-ported that for the seventh consecutive year crime in Hanover Park has declined to a new record low. Hanover Park was also named thirty-seventh on Neighborhood Scout’s list of America’s 100 Safest Cities. The Hanover Park Police Department uti-lizes a strong community outreach initiative, Police and Citizens Connected, which employs several social media channels for enhanced communication with residents. Working to-gether, law enforcement, local officials, and Hanover Park residents have positioned the town as safe place to live, work, and raise a family. Day in and day out the men and women of the Hanover Park Police Department risk their lives to protect their community. The shrinking crime rate is a direct result of their courageous leadership, which will continue to protect this wonderful community. Police Chief Michael Menough credited the hard work of his offi-cers, neighbors, and community leaders stat-ing, ‘‘We have made community policing the central focus of our service delivery, and this will remain our top priority.’’ With all hands on deck I am sure Hanover Park will continue to see record lows in crime for many years to come. Mr. Speaker and distinguished colleagues, please join me in recognizing the community of Hanover Park, Illinois and congratulating them on being named one of the safest cities in America.

TRIBUTE TO CHANCELLOR PAUL HARDIN 
HON. DAVID E. PRICE 
OF NORTH CAROLINA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, July 12, 2017 Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the life and legacy of Paul Har-din III, former Chancellor of the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, who died on July 1 after a courageous battle with ALS. My wife Lisa and I treasure the friendship of Paul and his wife Barbara and were privileged to join his family in a moving memorial service at University United Methodist Church last Saturday. Paul was a man of great intelligence and in-sight, moral seriousness and integrity, and ir-repressible enthusiasm and dedication—quali-ties abundantly evident throughout his career in higher education. As was said more than once in the memo-rial service, Paul pledged allegiance to ‘‘two shades of blue.’’ The deeper hue belonged to Duke University, where he earned his under-graduate and law degrees and edited the Duke Law Journal. Paul then served in the Army’s Counter In-telligence Corps and practiced law in Bir-mingham before returning to Durham to spend ten years on the faculty of Duke Law School. He was appointed to his first college presi-dency, at Wofford College, at age 37, and went on to serve as president of Southern Methodist and Drew Universities. In 1988 he became the seventh chancellor of UNC–CH, where he served until his retirement in 1995. As a young man, Paul made a credible run for Mayor of Durham, and throughout his life he was attentive and involved in national, state, and local politics. In recent years, Paul, along with Barbara, brought his trademark high energy to the leadership of Democrats in their retirement community, Carolina Mead-ows. They also shared, as children of ministers, deep roots in the Methodist Church. Paul, his son Russell reported at the memorial service, seriously considered entering the ministry as a young man. But his father, who was a Meth-odist bishop, assured him that he could render faithful service and powerful witness in his chosen fields of education and the law. Paul’s father was right, as the thousands whose lives Paul touched can attest. I am honored to join this chorus of tribute, and in-clude in the RECORD a piece by Paul’s friend and mine, Village Communications President Jim Heavner, from the Raleigh News and Ob-server of July 5. 
PAULHARDIN —A G OODMANWHOMADEUNC B
ETTER  When Paul Hardin slipped away last week, North Carolina lost a brilliant and fine man, a UNC chancellor whose leadership was en-dearing, its lessons enduring. ‘‘This may be audacious, but here’s an idea,’’ I heard him say so often as a way to prepare us to hear how he might see the fu-ture differently. The good fortune of my work and home town gave me much time with Paul and a friendship that grew. He and I were pulled together in work when my company owned the school’s sports network. It was the good fortune of us all to learn from him. Among the leaders I have known, none was more dogged in defense of the val-ues he sought to protect. He was clear-eyed and courageous in facing down those who threatened those values. It was likely the example of his Methodist minister father (also a bishop) that incul-cated his habit to find noble qualities among many where the rest of us could not. An extroverted and joyful soul, he loved much about politics and once ran for the town council in Durham. It is little-known that he served in the CIA, or that his excellent golf game honed on the Duke team (his alma mater) qualified him for the British Open at a time when he was in Scotland. A great storyteller, Paul loved to recall those days and so many more. He was a brilliant student who finished first in his class at Duke, where he also ob-tained his law degree. He would have to call on all of that as a university leader. It’s a job with high prestige buffeted daily by high winds of disparate owners and bosses and the thunder of their loudest voices. Paul would frequently recall the story attributed to Lin-coln about the politician who was tarred and feathered and run out of town on a rail: ‘‘Ex-cept for the honor of the public experience, I would have preferred to walk.’’ Most every university is beset with the challenge of balancing the conflicting goals of big-time sports and the university’s aca-demic mission. As president of Southern Methodist University, Paul Hardin heard of a minor malfeasance by the football coach that led him to learn of cash payments to players. Paul was not a Pollyanna. He had a good political radar but never let it overpower his gyroscope. Knowing that he was in Dallas, where many see football as the reason to have a university, he nonetheless reported it to the NCAA and told his trustees that he was going to clean it up, knowing that he would face criticism. His board members fired him. The school ultimately was given the NCAA’s only four- year ‘‘death penalty.’’ Paul later said that it ‘‘perked up’’ his ca-reer. It was that experience, his exhibition of putting his values first, he said, that got him the job heading UNC in Chapel Hill 13 years later. Unflinching in his support of the Knight Commission on College Athletics’ position that a school was more important than any coach, he never swerved in his commitment to administrative control of athletics and transparency in its dealings. He was a great fan of basketball and UNC’s iconic Dean Smith. Yet, when the head coach’s Nike con-tract came up for renewal on Paul’s watch, the chancellor insisted that it be made pub-lic. (Ironically, while he was demanding the coach’s contractual transparency, he also was being criticized in cartoons in The News & Observer for allowing Dean to make so much money while he was away playing golf. In some things, you just can’t win.) He also faced issues of protest and social unrest. He was caught in the jaws of irreconciably-conflicting forces when sup-porters of the Black Cultural Center wanted it expanded into its own, freestanding build-ing, something others opposed. The chan-cellor was initially opposed, as an advocate for more integration. He saw it as a contrib-utor to separatism. The faceoff between conservatives and growing campus protests became over-whelming. Hardin agreed to build the center, which was done in the subsequent adminis-tration. Yet, he had paid a price for it in criticism from all sides. Paul was a pioneer in fundraising, creating the university’s first major fund campaign that was first announced as one for $200 mil-lion to celebrate the UNC Bicentennial. That was then raised to $300 million and ulti-mately reported $412 million in gifts. Paul showed them the way. The school now channels that Hardin audacity, embarking now on its second multi-billion-dollar cam-paign. He loved being the ‘‘Bicentennial Chan-cellor,’’ with its many commemorations, in-cluding an anniversary speech in Kenan Sta-dium by President Bill Clinton. Paul Hardin loved life, one well-lived until the ravages of ALS took him away. He was still able to find good in all things and laughter with good friends until the end. Paul could lament the awful examples and roiling consequences of today’s political leadership, even as he might find something good in each of those who are, at least, he might say, willing to lead. The more we pon-der that world view, that life, the closer we come to our own better angels. Our community and our state lost a good man. A good, good man. f

SUGAR LAND BAKERY NAMED BEST IN TEXAS 
HON. PETE OLSON 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, July 12, 2017 Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Anonymous Cafe´of Sugar Land for being named the best bakery in Texas by Buzzfeed. Anonymous, named after its owners Patricia and Tasos Pantazopoulos couldn’t agree on a name, is a farmhouse-chic style cafe´that sells desserts, Italian coffee drinks, olive oil and oregano, on top of a full dining menu. The Greek natives opened the cafe´after moving to Sugar Land to be closer to Patricia’s family. The cafe´was named the best bakery in Texas earlier this year by the website Buzzfeed and has customers travelling from all over the country to try their made from scratch Greek desserts. On behalf of the Twenty-Second Congres-sional District of Texas, congratulations again to Anonymous Cafe´for being named the best bakery in Texas. We’re honored to have Texas’ best bakery right in the heart of TX–22. Great job.
