MORNING-HOUR DEBATE The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-ant to the order of the House of Janu-ary 8, 2018, the Chair will now recog-nize Members from lists submitted by the majority and minority leaders for morning-hour debate.

HONORING VALDOSTA STATE FOOTBALL The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. C
ARTER ) for 5 minutes. Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-er, I rise today to recognize the Val-dosta State University football team for winning their fourth Division II Na-tional Championship on December 15. The Blazers prevented a 2-point conver-sion with 40 seconds left in the game to defeat Ferris State University 49–47. With a record of 14–0 this year, Val-dosta State had the Nation’s top scor-ing offense. The offense was led by their quarterback, Rogan Wells, who was a finalist for best player in the country. He passed for 349 yards, ran for 39, and caught a touchdown pass in the national championship victory. Valdosta, though, is no stranger to victories. Located in south Georgia, it has been recognized by ESPN as Title Town, USA. Over the years, Valdosta teams have won a combined 452 titles across different levels of competition and sports. Congratulations, Valdosta State. Go Blazers. RECOGNIZING DR . GEORGE E . FRANCISCO  
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-er, I rise today to recognize Dr. George E. Francisco on four decades of teach-ing pharmacists at the college level, nearly all of which have been spent with the University of Georgia. Known across campus as an out-standing teacher for his personable ap-proach with his students, Dr. Francisco has won numerous awards using his own, unique teaching skills. He was awarded Outstanding Teacher at the University of Georgia, named to Out-standing Young Men of America, and was featured in the Georgia Phar-macist Magazine, among many other accolades. His students say that Dr. Francisco ‘‘exemplifies what it means to be a teacher in the truest sense’’ and that ‘‘he represents the kind of professional that someday they hope to become.’’ I am so proud that the State of Geor-gia has Dr. Francisco training our next generation of pharmacists. Teachers like him are some of the greatest as-sets of our society, and I hope that he continues to make such an important impact for years to come. Thank you for your work and dedica-tion, Dr. Francisco. 
RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF PARKER GREENE  
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-er, I rise today to recognize Mr. Parker Greene of Valdosta, Georgia, who passed away on December 18, 2018. Mr. Greene was a stalwart of Moody Air Force Base in Valdosta. In 2007, he was honored with the Exceptional Pub-lic Service Award for his work on the base. His colleagues said that they don’t know if anyone else could ‘‘com-pare with his dedication and contribu-tions to Moody.’’ Mr. Greene had been working with the base since the early 1970s, when he served as the first chairman of military affairs for the Lowndes-Valdosta Chamber of Commerce. Among a num-ber of other contributions, he has also worked with the Department of Trans-portation on roads leading in and out of the base and even has a building there named after him. Mr. Greene has truly been involved in every aspect with both Moody Air Force Base and the surrounding area, touching the lives of countless people who have been stationed there. His family, friends, and everyone at Moody will be in my thoughts and prayers during this most difficult time. f 
FAREWELL ADDRESS TO CONGRESS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Guam (Ms. B
ORDALLO ) for 5 minutes. Ms. BORDALLO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in appreciation of the people of Guam for their trust, support, and re-spect and for allowing me the honor of representing Guam and their interests here in the Congress of the United States for eight terms. I also rise this final time in apprecia-tion to my colleagues in this wonderful institution, the U.S. House of Rep-resentatives, for their support over the years as we have worked on many impactful issues for the betterment of our constituents and our Nation. It has been my honor to serve in Con-gress for the last 16 years, and I leave here proud of what we have accom-plished not just for Guam, but for our

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH10272 December 19, 2018 
Nation and our allies in the Asia-Pa-cific region. As the nonvoting delegate for 168,000 Americans who live on the western-most territory of the United States of America, I worked with my congres-sional colleagues to support policies, programs, and legislation that have benefited the people of Guam. I have also secured billions of dollars in Fed-eral investment in Guam and our peo-ple. With the support of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, we saw the pas-sage of landmark legislation for Guam, including passing war reparations to recognize the survivors of the occupa-tion of Guam during World War II, en-shrining the independence of Guam’s judiciary as a coequal branch of gov-ernment, enhancing regional security with the relocation of marines to Guam, holding the military account-able to its responsibilities to Guam’s civilian population, promoting Guam’s Chamorro culture, protecting our envi-ronment, and improving healthcare for veterans and all Guam residents. In just this last year, I have worked with entrepreneurs to jump-start the process for Guam to eventually become a commercial spaceport. I have also en-gaged leaders in the renewable energy industry and sponsored legislation passed unanimously by the House to develop offshore wind energy that will benefit Guam’s electricity needs for decades to come. We have strengthened relations with our neighbors in the Asia-Pacific and enhanced tourism, Guam’s largest non-military industry and employer. Finally, through engagement and co-operation with our regional allies, we have enhanced the security of the Indo- Asia-Pacific region and our national interests, countering growing threats and safeguarding against rogue coun-tries. These are just some of our suc-cesses. My colleagues would often tease me by saying: ‘‘Here comes Miss Guam. What does she want now?’’ While this was often said jokingly, and I have al-ways accepted this as good-natured humor, I hope that it speaks to the dedication that I brought to effectively representing my constituents as the first woman to serve as Guam’s elected Delegate to the United States Con-gress. Mr. Speaker, Guam residents have no other voice or voting representation in their Federal Government to champion their interests and causes. Despite the successes we have had during my ten-ure, I cannot leave without com-menting on the disparity between the Representatives from the 50 States and the Delegates who represent 4 million fellow Americans residing in the U.S. territories. It is unfortunate, Mr. Speaker, that our country continues to disenfran-chise Americans in the territories merely because of where we live. My constituents lack full voting represen-tation in the House, have no represen-tation in the Senate, and are denied the right to vote for the President of the United States; and yet we serve and sacrifice at the highest rates in our military. When I was first elected to Congress in 2002, one of my predecessors, the late Congressman Ben Blaz, commented to me that, as Guam’s Delegate, I would be a Member of Congress but not one of its true Members. I hope that we will continue to see our Nation strive for that goal, and that includes giving full representation and voting rights to our fellow Americans living in the terri-tories and the District of Columbia. Mr. Speaker, while I am saddened for my congressional tenure to come to a close, I leave proud of my work to ad-vance Guam’s interests and thankful for the support and friendship of the colleagues with whom I have served for these past 16 years. I am also eternally grateful to the nearly 200 staffers and interns who have aided me throughout the years in the congressional office. I am especially appreciative for the staff who were with me during this last year in Congress. In my D.C. office: Adam Carbullido, Rosanne Mantanona, Howard Pangelinan, Edgar Yanger, Brandon Westling, Iain Hart, and Kath-erine Lee. In my Guam district office: Jon Junior Calvo, Kaye Lea Custodio, Amanda Shelton, Robert San Agustin, Audria-Marie Lizama, and Diosdado Razon. I would not have been successful without their dedication and tireless support. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in appreciation of the people of Guam for their trust, support, and respect and for allowing me the honor of representing Guam and their interests here in the Congress of the United States for eight terms. I also rise, this final time, in appreciation to my colleagues in this wonderful institution— the U.S. House of Representatives—for their comradery, support, and collegiality over the years as we worked on many impactful issues for the betterment of our constituents and our nation. It has been my honor to serve in Congress for the last 16 years, and I leave here proud of what we have accomplished, not just for Guam, but for our nation and our allies in the Asia-Pacific region. These 16 years I have led, supported, or participated in the national debates, discus-sions, and policy developments that have im-proved global and national security, enhanced our economic and political wellbeing, con-served our precious natural resources, and im-proved quality of life for all Americans. As the non-voting delegate for 168,000 Americans who live on the western-most sov-ereign territory of the United States of Amer-ica, I worked with my Congressional col-leagues to support policies, programs and leg-islation that have benefitted the people of Guam. I have also secured billions of dollars in federal investment in Guam and our people. With the support of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, we saw the passage of landmark legislation for Guam, including pass-ing war reparations to recognize the survivors of the Occupation of Guam during World War II; enshrining the independence of Guam’s ju-diciary as a co-equal branch of Government, enhancing regional security with the relocation of Marines to Guam; holding the military ac-countable to its responsibilities to Guam’s civil-ian population, promoting Guam’s Chamorro culture, protecting our environment, and im-proving healthcare for veterans and all Guam residents. Some of our most exciting achievements are yet to be realized with the groundwork we have undertaken to further the development of new opportunities for economic development and self-sufficiency for Guam, our national in-terests, and the region. In just this last year, I have worked with en-trepreneurs to jump start the process for Guam to eventually become a commercial spaceport. I have also engaged leaders in the renew-able energy industry and sponsored legislation passed unanimously by the House to develop offshore wind energy that will benefit Guam’s self-sufficiency, sustainability, and electricity needs for decades to come. We have strengthened relations with our neighbors in the Asia-Pacific and enhanced tourism, Guam’s largest non-military industry and employer. Finally, through engagement and coopera-tion with our regional allies, we have en-hanced the security of the Indo-Asia-Pacific region and our national interests, countering growing threats and safeguarding against rogue countries. These are just some of our successes. My colleagues would often tease me by saying, ‘‘Here comes Miss Guam.’’ While this was often said jokingly, and I have always accepted this as good-natured humor, I hope that it speaks to the dedication and tenacity that I brought to effectively rep-resenting my constituents, as the first woman to serve as Guam’s elected Delegate to the U.S. Congress. Guam residents have no other voice or vot-ing representation in their Federal govern-ment, to champion their interests and causes. Despite the successes we have had during my tenure, I cannot leave without commenting on the disparity between the Representatives from the 50 states, and the Delegates who represent 4 million fellow Americans residing in the U.S. territories. It is unfortunate, Mr. Speaker, that our coun-try continues to disenfranchise Americans in the territories merely because of where we live. My constituents lack full voting representa-tion in the House, have no representation in the Senate, and are denied the right to vote for the President of the United States; and yet, we serve and sacrifice at the highest rates in our military. When I was first elected to Congress in 2002, one of my predecessors, the late Con-gressman Ben Blaz, commented to me that as Guam’s Delegate, I would be a Member of Congress, but not one of its Members. I have been proud to stand alongside my colleagues—both Democrat and Republican— all patriotic citizens doing their level best to reach what our Constitution calls a more per-fect union. I hope that we will continue to see our na-tion strive for that goal, and that includes giv-ing full representation and voting rights to our fellow Americans living in the territories and the District of Columbia.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. P
OE) for 5 minutes. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, Megan Rondini was a student at the University of Alabama. She originally was from Austin, Texas, but chose the University of Alabama as her school of choice. Megan went to school there. While she was a student, she came in contact with a former student whose nickname was ‘‘Sweet T.’’ He took her to his residence, which was literally a plantation home, and sexually as-saulted her. Megan then jumped out of the second-story window of his resi-dence and went to the hospital. That is where her nightmare continued. While Megan was at the hospital, the people in charge there didn’t know how to deal with a sexual assault victim, and the sexual assault exam was botched. She left the hospital and went to the sheriff’s department. They started interviewing her and found out that the alleged perpetrator was from an important family in the area. All of a sudden, they backed off, according to her. They didn’t prosecute Sweet T. In fact, they read Megan a Miranda warn-ing. Megan went to the University of Ala-bama and sought a counselor. The counselor found out who the alleged perpetrator was and said: ‘‘I can’t help you. This is a conflict of interest. I know this person.’’ The University of Alabama didn’t provide her another counselor. Megan then went into a depression. She left the University of Alabama and transferred to SMU in Dallas, Texas. Shortly after she transferred to SMU, Megan Rondini took her own life. You see, Mr. Speaker, she got the death penalty for being a victim of crime. Nothing ever happened to the alleged perpetrator. There are a lot of problems and issues that came up with the way Megan was treated at the hospital and how she was treated at the sheriff’s de-partment and by the university. There was no sexual assault forensic exam-iner or sexual assault forensic nurse at the hospital to take care of her. And who are these people? These are wonderful people who are trained to deal with sexual assault vic-tims. The hospital didn’t have one of those for her. It turns out there are many hospitals in the country that

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH10274 December 19, 2018 
don’t have these individuals to help sexual assault victims. They are trained to deal with victims exclu-sively. I have talked and met with Megan’s parents, Cindi and Mike, who still live in Austin, and we have talked and met with a lot of Members of Congress on what we can do about this. We have filed H.R. 7292, a bipartisan bill. Issues regarding victims of crime are bipar-tisan. The Megan Rondini and Leah Griffin Sexual Assault Victims Protection Act provides for a task force and a mul-titude of other things so we can get this problem solved and have hospitals get it together so we treat sexual as-sault victims the way they should be treated. I am not going to go into all the de-tails, but it is great, and bipartisan. It is cosponsored by Congresswoman J
AYAPAL . We have many Members on both sides working on this issue to bring it to the House floor under sus-pension of the rules or unanimous con-sent to get this legislation passed. b1215 It is my understanding, as of high noon today, that this legislation is not going to come to the floor of this Con-gress. It is my hope and desire that it comes next year when I am not here but other people take up the mantle to protect people like Megan Rondini and Leah Griffin. Mr. Speaker, there are a lot of lobby-ists in Washington, D.C. I understand there are 5,000 lobbying groups. That is 10 for every Member of Congress up here, advocating on all kinds of things. Victims of crimes do not have high- dollar lobbyists. We are their voice. We are their only voice, Mr. Speaker. We ought to start acting like it and bring legislation to the floor on a bipartisan basis and not find excuses not to do it, because we are it. People like Megan Rondini are protected by the same Con-stitution that protects defendants of crime. It is important that we help those people and their families make sure that they don’t continue to be victims of crime after the crime is committed. The system should not continue to make them victims of crime, whether it is the hospital, whether it is the sheriff’s department or the university. I do want to say, Mr. Speaker, the University of Alabama has made some changes. Texas A&M has made changes due to the 12th Woman group and a group of victims at Texas A&M that are talking to Members of Congress, too. I hope that Congress will see this leg-islation as a priority and pass it, be-cause it is the right thing to do, even if we have to wait until next year. And that is just the way it is, Mr. Speaker. 
f 
END HUNGER NOW The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN ) for 5 minutes. Mr. M
CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, as I have reminded my colleagues many times, there is not a congressional dis-trict in America that is hunger free. Hunger in America defies stereotypes. Many families that grapple with food insecurity are working but still don’t make enough money to buy sufficient food after all the bills are paid. That is why, on the Monday and Tuesday before Thanksgiving, I partici-pated in the ninth annual Monte’s March, a 43-mile walk to raise aware-ness about hunger in our community and to raise money for the Food Bank of Western Massachusetts. The leader was Monte Belmonte, a well-known radio personality and a committed activist on behalf of those who are vulnerable. I was so proud to join him again this year to walk the 43 miles. I am even more proud that he raised nearly $300,000. This translates into nearly 3 million meals for people struggling with food insecurity. Mr. Speaker, I was so impressed by the incredible generosity of our com-munity. It was inspiring. While food banks, food pantries, and charitable organizations are vital in our efforts to combat hunger, they can-not do it alone. We need a strong com-mitment by our government to do its part. Indeed, I would argue that we have fallen short of doing what is needed. Those who I had the pleasure of march-ing alongside during Monte’s March understand that, and they understand what it means to be part of a commu-nity. Today, I would like to thank them for their work. First and foremost, to Monte Belmonte and all the people at WRSI, The River—Mark Lattanzi, Joan Holliday, Kaliis Smith, Kelly Sykes, Betsy Cortis, Matt Peterson, and Steve Trumpy—thank you so very much. You are all wonderful. I would like to thank Andrew More-house, the executive director of the Food Bank of Western Massachusetts, and everyone at the food bank for all the incredible work that they do. I would like to thank Sean Barry from Four Seasons Liquor in Hadley, who was Monte’s right-hand man for 2 days. I would like to thank all the elected officials who joined part of the march, including Congressman J
OEKENNEDY ; State Representative Aaron Vega; State Senator-elect Jo Comerford; and State Representatives-elect Natalie Blais, Mindy Domb, Dan Carey, and Lindsay Sabadosa. And, of course, I would like to thank Northwestern Dis-trict Attorney David Sullivan. I would like to thank Easthampton Mayor Nicole LaChapelle, North-ampton Mayor David Narkewicz, and Chicopee Mayor Richard Kos, who have always been key partners in the fight to end hunger. I want to thank Tim Garvin of the United Way of Central Massachusetts; Ronn Johnson, CEO of the Martin Lu-ther King Jr. Family Services in Springfield; Ruben Reyes, operations manager at Lorraine’s Soup Kitchen in Chicopee; and Jasmin Colon, Kate’s Kitchen in Holyoke. Each of them has done so much to help those who are struggling with hunger. A special thank you to the sheriff’s departments in Hampden, Hampshire, and Franklin Counties, as well as the Deerfield Police, who provided escorts for us during all 43 miles. We are so grateful for all they do to keep us safe every day. Thank you to the Expandable Brass Band, the drum corps from Franklin County Technical School, and per-formers from Double Edge Theatre in Ashfield for keeping us jazzed up dur-ing the entire march. I want to thank everyone who gave us space to rest and good food along the way: The Bistro at Gateway City Arts in Holyoke, Sierra Grille, BridgeSide Grille, Berkshire Brewing Company, Ben Clark of Clarkdale Fruit Farms, Tea Guys, Stone Soup Cafe, and the Hope & Olive and Magpie in Green-field. Thank you to the schoolchildren who greeted us and raised funds to support our cause, including Nurse Meg and her team of marchers from Conway Gram-mar School, Steph Barry and Erving Elementary, and Mr. Brooks and Smith Voc-Tech for their help with the carts we used to march. I want to, of course, thank my son, Patrick, who marched with me the en-tire second day. Finally, to our VIP marchers—Chia Collins; Steve the Hippie; Rick and Georgiann Kristek; Andrea Ayvazian; Marina Goldman; Leigh Rae; Kristen Elechko and her baby, Elizabeth Dunaway; Marianne Mahoney; Michelle Spaziani; Amy Proietti; Neftali Duran; Margot Wise; and Terry Wise—we sim-ply could not have done this without you. Thank you, thank you, thank you, from the bottom of my heart. Mr. Speaker, I was glad to be part of this, but I close by expressing my deep concern about the future. With so many people in need of assistance, any cuts to SNAP would be devastating for families across this country. This next Congress needs to stand firm against any more cuts to SNAP. We ought to stand firm against any structural changes to the program and any more burdensome requirements. We must protect this program and other programs that provide people nu-trition. Food ought to be a fundamental right for everybody in this country. We live in the richest country in the history of the world. Nobody should be hungry. In the spirit of all those who took part in Monte’s March, we in this Con-gress can and will do better. We must end hunger now.

gentleman from Kansas (Mr. M AR-
SHALL ) for 5 minutes. Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the House’s work that aims to improve outcomes for children with complex medical condi-tions. As a physician, I have delivered more than 10,000 babies and seen firsthand many of these complex and com-plicated conditions, often when babies are born prematurely. Today, there are 33 million children dependent upon Medicaid in our coun-try. Two million of these cases are con-sidered medically complex. It is imper-ative that we take a compassionate look at the way in which this care is being provided to some of our most vul-nerable patients. I am proud of the legislation the House recently passed to address the way that care is provided for these children. Last week, we passed the IM-PROVE Act with overwhelming bipar-tisan support. This legislation included the Advancing Care for Exceptional Kids Act that aims to put our Nation’s sickest kids and their families first by improving their care. These children and their families al-ready face many challenges. Thus, our healthcare system has to work with them by making access to care more manageable and easier to navigate. Too often, these children are forced to see multiple doctors, sometimes re-quiring them to go across State lines for treatment. This can be costly, time consuming, and confusing. This bill re-duces the burden on families by no longer making them jump through hoops for their children’s coverage. The ACE Act also ensures that each child gets the coverage they need by helping hospitals coordinate across State lines and provides additional re-sources to families to help them navi-gate the healthcare system. This co-ordination will likely reduce emer-gency visits and inpatient hospitaliza-tions and, ultimately, lower the overall cost of care for these children, while at the same time provide for better out-comes. In Kansas, 41 percent of children with special healthcare needs are covered by Medicaid. I appreciate the opportunity to make Medicaid a more caring, com-prehensive, and efficient system for each and every child with a serious, long-term illness. 
IMPORTANCE OF INTERNET ACCESS  
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, as I have traveled across Kansas, I have heard how a strong Internet connection can impact communities, boost local economies, and create jobs. Access to the Internet allows small businesses to sell their products across the country and the world. It enables students to access additional learning tools and gives doctors the ability to treat patients in the most remote parts of the district. Far too often, I am reminded of the complications my district has to get connected. I rise today to highlight the recent steps taken to advance broadband deployment in rural Amer-ica. Last week, the Federal Communica-tions Commission unanimously voted to provide additional funding to car-riers utilizing the Universal Service Fund high-cost program. The high-cost program helps providers deploy broadband infrastructure in extremely rural and hard-to-reach places where the cost to connect is just too high. I am also excited that the United States Department of Agriculture is working to expand broadband access to our ag producers. I was grateful to join Secretary Perdue as he announced details of a new broadband pilot program last week at the Department of Agriculture. The program, called ReConnect, targets funding in the forms of grants and loans to areas currently lacking a reli-able Internet connection. Farmers and ranchers need a broadband connection to monitor their operations and increase efficiencies on their farms, which ultimately drives down the cost of doing business. Connectivity is such a vital part of everyday life, and its importance con-tinues to grow. People’s access should not be affected by where they choose to live. I want that thank Secretary Perdue, Chairman Pai, and President Trump for making broadband deployment a priority. f 
THANKING NEVADA’S FOURTH DISTRICT The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Nevada (Mr. K
IHUEN ) for 5 minutes. Mr. KIHUEN. Mr. Speaker, today, I stand before the House to thank the people of Nevada’s Fourth Congres-sional District. It has been the honor of my life to serve as a Member of Con-gress and represent my constituents in the 115th Congress. I have worked tire-lessly on their behalf every single day to make Nevada a great place to live and raise a family. As many of my colleagues know, I was not born in this country. I don’t come from a wealthy or politically connected family. My family emigrated from Mexico when I was 8 years old. My parents, a housekeeper and a former farm worker, came to America because they knew that, if they worked hard and sacrificed, in America, they could achieve the American Dream. Less than 30 years later, thanks to the wonderful opportunities that only this country has to offer, their son is standing before you as a Representa-tive of the United States of America. That is the American Dream. There are still so many people who have hopes and aspirations of achieving that American Dream. Unfortunately, under this administration, immigrants have been denigrated. Before even being given a chance, they are labeled as criminals and murderers. But America is a Nation of immi-grants and the land of opportunity. As the first Dreamer and one of the first two former undocumented immigrants to serve in Congress in our Nation’s history, I have used my personal expe-rience to fight for other Dreamers so that DACA recipients are able to re-main in America and thrive. I have fought to ensure that our asy-lum process is upheld and that young, innocent children are not separated from their families at the border. I have advocated for comprehensive im-migration reform. My Democratic colleagues and I have also fought relentlessly to protect peo-ple’s healthcare and the Affordable Care Act, especially as Republicans have tried time and time again to get rid of preexisting conditions. I was proud to announce my support for the Medicare for All Act because healthcare is a human right, and all Americans deserve quality and afford-able healthcare. I joined my union brothers and sis-ters in championing workers’ rights, fighting for a $15 minimum wage, the right to join a union, and equal pay for women. I fought against the unconstitutional travel ban, fiercely defended funding for Planned Parenthood, and stood side by side with our LGBTQ community in the fight for full equality. As a member of the Financial Serv-ices Committee, I have fought to keep people in their homes and advocated for affordable housing and the imme-diate need to address homelessness in America. I was proud to join the Nevada dele-gation in standing strong to fight against efforts to bring nuclear waste to Yucca Mountain. Yucca Mountain is not safe and should remain closed for-ever. I introduced the STEP for Veterans Act, which would provide grants to community colleges to train veterans with the job skills that employers need in their communities. Although we can never do enough to thank our veterans for their sacrifices, I am proud of the work that I did to help them get the re-sources they need and deserve. Mr. Speaker, one of the worst days of my life and in many of my constitu-ents’ lives was last year on October 1, 2017, when Las Vegas became the site of the deadliest mass shooting in mod-ern American history. In total, 58 inno-cent lives were lost. While they are gone, I wanted to make sure that their memories were not lost. That is why I told each of their 58 stories here on the House floor, so that their precious and vibrant lives would be remembered and never forgot-ten. I am optimistic that the House will finally pass meaningful legislation next year to prevent more tragedies from happening. b1230 Lastly, Mr. Speaker, I thank my team who worked tirelessly day in and

day out to deliver services to hundreds of Nevadans. I relied on them every day to do my job, and I couldn’t have done it without them. I am profoundly grateful and forever grateful to each and every one of them. Thank you to my colleagues for mak-ing my time as a Member of Congress unforgettable. I made so many friends here, friendships that will last a life-time. Thank you to all the staff in the House of Representatives, including the floor staff, the cleaning crew, the kitchen staff, all of you whom I en-joyed many great conversations with. Thank you to my family and friends for all of your unconditional support. Thank you, once again, to my con-stituents for putting your faith and trust in me. I am blessed and honored to serve you and grateful for the oppor-tunity to give back to the State and country that has given me and my fam-ily so much. (English translation of the statement made in Spanish is as follows:) 
Thank you to the people of Nevada for your support and the opportunity to serve you in the U.S. Congress. I will always fight for you. Muchas gracias a toda la gente de Nevada por su apoyo y por la oportunidad de servirles en el Congreso de los Estados Unidos. Simpre luchare por ustedes!

ODNEY DAVIS of Illinois) at 2 p.m.

PRAYER The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: Gracious and merciful God, we give You thanks for giving us another day. The Members of the 115th Congress return to the Capitol for the final days of legislative business. We ask Your blessing, O Lord, upon them, for they face potentially difficult negotiation. May they be filled with a surfeit of wis-dom and patience. May all that is done this day be for Your greater honor and glory. Amen. THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair has examined the Journal of the last day’s proceedings and announces to the House his approval thereof. Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Jour-nal stands approved. Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker’s approval of the Journal. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the Speaker’s approval of the Journal. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not present. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-ant to clause 8, rule XX, further pro-ceedings on this question will be post-poned. The point of no quorum is considered withdrawn. f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. C
OMER ) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. COMER led the Pledge of Alle-giance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Repub-lic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f 
RECOGNIZING DREW AND LIZ WHITE (Mr. COMER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Mr. and Mrs. Drew and Liz White of Union County, Kentucky, for recently being named Kentucky Farm Bureau’s 2018 Out-standing Young Farm Family. This award recognizes young farmers be-tween the ages of 18 and 35 who have shown strong leadership potential and farm management skills and have achieved consistent financial success in their farming operations. Drew and Liz come from families with rich histories in farming. Drew is the fourth generation to live and work on his family’s farm, established by his great-grandfather during the Great De-pression. Under Drew’s management, the farm has grown and experienced success with raising cattle and a mul-titude of crops. Liz also grew up on a family farm and enjoyed showing saddlebred horses during her youth. She worked at a local winery throughout her high school and college years before becom-ing an occupational therapy assistant. The couple have both been exten-sively involved in the local agricul-tural community through the Future Farmers of America organization, the 4–H, and the Kentucky Farm Bureau. Their efforts have not only benefited Union County, but are a model for other young farmers throughout the Commonwealth. On behalf of the First District of Kentucky, I congratulate Drew and Liz White on their outstanding success and wish them the best as they continue to grow their farming operation and their family. f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF CONNIE MITCHELL (Mr. MORELLE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Connie Mitchell, an iconic civil rights activist and leader in the Rochester commu-nity, who passed away on December 14. Connie dedicated her life to the pur-suit of equality and racial justice, and her commitment to breaking down bar-riers was truly awe inspiring. She was the first African American woman elected to office in Monroe County, winning a seat on the board of super-visors in 1961. She was a role model in the fight for equality. Her contribu-tions helped to open the door of oppor-tunity for so many people in our com-munity. I join all of Rochester in mourning her passing and extend my prayers and deepest sympathies to the entire Mitchell family. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF JUSTICE WILLIAM NEWSOM (Ms. PELOSI asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I wish to talk about a very special person in our community who recently left us. Mr. Speaker, I rise to pray tribute to a gen-tleman of exceptional generosity, deep principles, and extraordinary wit: Jus-tice William Newsom, or, as many called him, ‘‘Bill.’’ A dedicated public servant with a commitment to the arts and conserva-tion, he leaves a lasting legacy for America. Any one of us who knew him considered him a cherished friend. Bill was a proud fourth-generation San Franciscan, who was born to a large Irish brood. As a commissioner of the San Francisco Superior Court, judge on the Placer County Superior Court, and then California Court of Ap-peals judge, he worked relentlessly to uphold liberty and justice for all. Again, Bill’s charitable and civic contributions to our city and our State are legendary. He was endowed with great decency and humanity and took the golden rule literally. He considered an injustice and indignity to one an in-justice and indignity to all. A passionate student of natural his-tory and a lifelong enthusiast of the

outdoors, Bill worked relentlessly to preserve the beauty of God’s creation. His leadership on a vast range of con-servation and environmental organiza-tions was vital in protecting clean air, clean water, and public lands for our children and grandchildren. Bill also understood the power of the arts to bring us together and dedicated decades to fostering beauty, culture, and the arts in the bay area and around the world. Again, all who were fortunate enough to call Bill a friend knew him as a bril-liant man of letters, a tireless cham-pion of civic causes, and a trusted con-fidante of unsurpassed empathy and generosity. But it is Bill’s profound love of family that we will miss the most. Bill’s favorite role was that of patri-arch, or paterfamilias, of a big Irish brood. Family trips to Squaw Valley and Dutch Flat were his great joy, and he relished every opportunity to share books, stories, and special moments with his family, especially Irish lit-erature. Mr. Speaker, I will include in the R
ECORD an obituary written about Bill Newsom that I think everyone should read. It is about a person so special that you merely have to read the story to find it believable that somebody could accomplish such things with dig-nity and grace. Mr. Speaker, his obituary says that Justice William Newsom was pater-familias of a pioneering San Francisco family and a revered figure to his fam-ily, including his wonderful daughter, Hilary, whom we all love, and his son, Governor-elect Gavin Newsom, whom, unfortunately, he will not see sworn in, but he did see him elected Governor in November. Again, he is a fourth-generation San Franciscan, born to a large Irish Catholic brood in Depression-era San Francisco. His story is really the story of America. Again, throughout his life he served the community with great, great dig-nity. His civic and charitable commit-ments were substantial, serving on the Board of Regents of the University of Santa Clara. The list goes on in terms of education and the arts. Sometimes, Mr. Speaker, we lose someone whose passing makes it seem like an entire era has vanished, but that is not so with Bill Newsom be-cause he left such a legacy for us to continue to enjoy. Again, he is survived by Hilary; Gavin; his beautiful grandchildren, whom he enjoyed so much time with in later years; and so many friends who revered him. I want our colleagues to knew this very special person made a mark on the lives of so many of us in the great State of California and our country. If you have a moment, read his obituary. It is a story of America, of the Amer-ican Dream of a great Irish American family, a pioneer family in California. Again, when Gavin is sworn in the first week of January, we will all take such great pride in the love that his fa-ther had for him and his sister, Hilary, and know that he is looking down from Heaven on that blessed day for the State of California as the Newsom leg-acy lives on. f

CONGENITAL HEART FUTURES REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2017 Mr. WALDEN.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-ant to the rule, the gentleman from Or-egon (Mr. W
ALDEN ) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. T
ONKO ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oregon. 
GENERAL LEAVE  
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and in-sert extraneous materials into the R
ECORD on the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Oregon? There was no objection. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1222, the Congenital Heart Fu-tures Reauthorization Act. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Representative G
USBILIRAKIS of Flor-ida, who is a valued member of our En-ergy and Commerce Committee, for bringing this bill forward and for his passion on this very important issue. As one of the original authors of this legislation, he drove this reauthoriza-tion forward, and I am proud to stand in support of it once again with Mr. B
ILIRAKIS . As the parent of a child who died from a congenital heart defect, I know how much today’s vote gives hope to the parents, infants, and adults across the country who live with the effects of congenital heart disease, the most common birth defect and the leading cause of birth defect-related infant mortality. This affects 40,000 families every year. Nearly 1 in every 100 babies is born with a congenital heart defect and roughly 25 percent of those will need heart surgery or other significant interventions to survive. Up to 200 each year do not survive. That is why this bill is so important. Originally passed in 2010, the Con-genital Heart Futures Act expanded in-frastructure at the CDC and increased research at NIH to better understand and treat patients with congenital heart defects. The reauthorization before us today ensures continued investment in that research, to identify the root causes of these defects and how to address them from birth to adulthood. Mr. Speaker, this House passed a version of this legislation earlier this year by a vote of 394–7, and the amend-ed version we will vote on today passed the Senate unanimously.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H10279 December 19, 2018 
Congenital Heart Futures Reauthoriza-tion Act led by Congressman B
ILIRAKIS  and Congressman S
CHIFF . This legislation builds on the success of current efforts by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to im-prove and expand research, surveil-lance, and public outreach and edu-cation programs relating to congenital heart disease. Each year more than 40,000 babies are born in the United States with a con-genital heart defect, and 1 million chil-dren and 1.4 million adults are cur-rently living with congenital heart dis-orders. Even though congenital heart disease is the most common birth defect in America, there are still many un-knowns surrounding the condition. This legislation will help expand our understanding of congenital heart dis-ease across the lifespan, and has the potential to improve the lives of the millions of children and adults living with congenital heart disease. Mr. Speaker, I therefore urge my col-leagues to support this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. B
URGESS ), the chair of our Sub-committee on Health. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding me time this afternoon. Supporting H.R. 1222 is important. This is the Congenital Heart Futures Reauthorization Act. This important piece of legislation passed this House by a vote of 394–7 10 months ago. Our Senate colleagues passed an amended version of this bill by unanimous con-sent last week. Clearly there is a hearty consensus that this bill will make a positive impact on public health. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, congenital heart defects are the most common types of birth defects. Congenital heart disease affects roughly 1 percent of births in the United States. This legis-lation strengthens the ability of the Department of Health and Human Services to collect data related to con-genital heart disease and to increase public awareness. The Secretary will be required to carry out activities through a national cohort study and a nationally rep-resentative, population-based surveil-lance system to further understand the epidemiology of congenital heart dis-ease. This bill authorizes a total of $10 mil-lion each year for fiscal years 2020 through 2024 for the purpose of car-rying out these activities. This bill does not focus on a par-ticular subpopulation of individuals. It aims to improve data regarding inci-dence, prevalence, and outcomes among all age groups, races, ethnicities, and both sexes. The Secretary will also look at evi-dence-based practices for the treat-ment and care of individuals with con-genital heart disease. Overall, the legislation is intended to improve our Nation’s approach to car-ing for individuals with congenital heart disease. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank our House champions on this legisla-tion, Representatives GUSBILIRAKIS  and A
DAM SCHIFF . They fought along-side Chairman G
REG WALDEN to get this bill across the finish line. And, of course, I want to thank the staff on the Subcommittee on Health and the full committee for bringing this to the floor last year. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this legislation which will improve the lives of Americans suffering from this terrible disease. Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. B
ILI-
RAKIS ), who has worked so diligently and hard on this legislation. Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding me time. I appreciate all his help on this particular bill, and the committee’s help as well. It has been a priority of ours. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1222, the Congenital Heart Fu-tures Reauthorization Act as amended by the Senate, which will ensure con-tinued investment in surveillance re-search to evaluate the lifelong needs of individuals with congenital heart de-fects, or CHD. These surveillance efforts will help improve our understanding of CHD across the lifespan, from birth to adult-hood. This research will help us learn more about demographic factors such as age, race, gender, and/or ethnicity. In addition, the legislation empha-sizes a need for continued biomedical research at the National Institutes of Health on the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of CHD. NIH will further research into the causes of congenital heart defects, in-cluding genetic causes, and study long- term outcomes in individuals with CHD of all ages. NIH may study data to identify effec-tive treatments and outcomes, and identify barriers to lifelong care for in-dividuals with congenital heart de-fects. CHD is the most common birth defect and the leading cause of birth defect- related infant mortality. For the Down syndrome community, about half of the children born with Down syndrome have CHD. The road ahead may be scary and un-certain for any parent with a newborn who has CHD, but this bill gives hope to those coping with the diagnosis. Nearly 1 in 100 babies, Mr. Speaker, are born with CHD and more than 5 percent will not live to see their first birthday. We have to fix that. Despite its prevalence and signifi-cance, there are still gaps in research and standards of care for CHD patients, but for the sake of the estimated 40,000 babies who will be born in the next year with CHD; there is more work to be done. Mr. Speaker, I began on this journey almost 10 years ago with my good friend, then-Congressman Zack Space. So what we did is we first introduced the Congenital Heart Futures Act back in 2009. Last Congress, Congressman SCHIFF  and I introduced the reauthorization of the original law. During this time, I met with a lot of patients with con-genital heart defects, and I have been touched by their stories: people like Trey and Nicole Flynn, a young Flor-ida couple who lost their son Holden while waiting for a heart transplant. He was 2 years old. This bill supports the essential re-search necessary to make sure another family doesn’t have to leave the hos-pital without their child in their arms. Lucas Iguina is a young man born with a complex congenital heart defect that essentially left him with half a heart. Despite having three open heart surgeries and countless doctor visits and medical procedures, Lucas has hopes and dreams. This bill ensures that the medical research will keep pace with his generation as they grow to be adults with this complex illness. Jackson Radandt, born with half a heart, has hypoplastic left heart syn-drome, which means the left side of his heart was underdeveloped. He depended on lifesaving research to help his fail-ing heart survive until his heart trans-plant at the age of 11. He is about 16 years old now, Mr. Speaker, and he will live his life with a heightened sensi-tivity for his new heart. Nicholas B. was born with a complex heart disease and wasn’t getting blood to the lower part of his body, requiring heart surgery when he was just 2 days old. He now is in the top of his class. This bill will ensure that his future re-mains bright as he navigates this chronic illness through adulthood. Who knows? Nicholas may be a congressman one day. b1515 Abigail Adams, a very familiar name, a young Florida advocate with Down syndrome. Roughly half of the babies born with Down syndrome have a con-genital heart defect. Abigail continues to advocate for individuals with Down syndrome. Then there is my friend, Dave. Dave was born with pulmonary stenosis, a condition where a heart valve will not open properly. He had emergency open- heart surgery when he was 2 days old, another surgery at the age of 10, and many hospital visits and procedures in the meantime. Today, he is a husband and a father of two, but he lives with atrial flutter. This bill will continue the surveil-lance program so we can collect data on children and adults with congenital heart problems. And Carolyn H., born with tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary atresia, had

open-heart surgery when she was 10 years old to repair her heart, but she will need periodic surgical updates to replace the cadaver artery. This bill continues the NIH research into why these defects occur. These are just some of the patients that I have met over the years, Mr. Speaker. There are many, many, many, many more. Lastly, I want to thank some of the advocates who have worked with me on getting this legislation passed. I want to thank: Dave Peluso, David Kasnic, Amy Basken, Dr. Brad Marino, and Jessica Chenevert from the Pediatric Congenital Heart Association. Mark Roeder and Daniel Hile from the Adult Congenital Heart Association. Vince Randazzo, Sara Weir, and Nicole Pat-ton from the National Down Syndrome Society; and, most importantly, our chairman for getting this through. Mr. Speaker, I urge swift passage of this lifesaving bill. Let’s get it to the President as soon as possible. Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I echo my support for the Senate amendment to H.R. 1222, it is worthy of our support. We will continue to build on the research and education con-cerning birth defects, and, most impor-tantly, we will enable individuals and families who live with birth defects to have more hope. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his kind comments on this bipar-tisan legislation. I think it is another fine work product from the Energy and Commerce Committee in the area of healthcare, health research, and help-ing families cope with these terrible tragedies that befall us. The Committee on Energy and Com-merce, as you know, Mr. Speaker, has done a lot of good work this cycle. I am especially proud of their work on opioids and opioid addiction. Their in-vestigative report now is public—over 300 pages of work—looking at how Americans got hooked on opioids, who is responsible, and what we should do going forward. This legislation on H.R. 1222, the Congenital Heart Futures Reauthoriza-tion Act of 2017, is another very impor-tant piece of legislation. It too will save lives and bring hope to American families. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1222, the Congenital Heart Futures Reauthorization Act, as amended by the Senate, which will ensure continued in-vestment in surveillance research to evaluate the lifelong needs of individuals with con-genital heart defects, or CHD. These surveillance efforts will help improve our understanding of CHD across the lifespan, from birth to adulthood. This research will help us learn more about demographic factors such as age, race, gender, or ethnicity.

NIH will further research into the causes of congenital heart defects, including genetic causes, and study long-term outcomes in individuals with CHD of all ages. NIH may study data to iden-tify effective treatments and outcomes, and identify barriers to lifelong care for individuals with congenital heart defects. CHD is the most common birth defect and the leading cause of birth defect-related infant mortality. For the Down Syndrome Commu-nity, about half of children born with Down Syndrome have CHD. The road ahead may be scary and uncertain for any parent with a newborn who has CHD, but this bill gives hope to those coping with the diagnosis. Nearly 1 in 100 babies are born with CHD and more than five percent will not live to see their first birthday. Despite its prev-alence and significance, there are still gaps in research and standards of care for CHD pa-tients. But for the sake of the estimated 40,000 babies who will be born in the next year with CHD, there’s more work to be done. Mr. Speaker, I began on this journey almost ten years ago when then-Congressman Zack Space and I, first introduced the Congenital Heart Futures Act back in 2009. Last Con-gress, Congressman S
CHIFF and I introduced the reauthorization of the original law. During this time, I’ve met a lot of patients with Congenital Heart Defects, and I’ve been touched by their story.

I want to thank Mark Roeder, Danielle Hile, Johanna Gray, and Erika Miller from the Adult Congenital Heart Association. Additionally, I want to recognize Vince Randazzo, Sara Weir, and Nicole Patton, from the National Down Syndrome Society and all their support. I also want to thank many of the people that worked quietly behind the scenes, whose names are seldom mentioned, and who never get the recognition they deserve. People like Megan Perez, Kristin Seum, Shayne Woods, Katie Novaria, Adrianna Simonelli, Kristen Shatynski, Paul Edattel, Josh Trent, James Paluskiewicz, Peter Kielty, Karen Christian, Ryan Long, Mike Bloomquist, Ed Kim, Nolan Ahern, Ian Martorana, Macey Sevcik, and Elena Hernandez.

GENERAL LEAVE  
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and in-sert extraneous materials in the R
ECORD on the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Oregon? There was no objection. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6615, the Traumatic Brain Injury Pro-gram Reauthorization Act of 2018. I thank Representative B
ILLPASCRELL  of New Jersey for his good work on this important legislation. I am glad to sup-port his efforts to bring another bipar-tisan public health bill forward for the full House to consider. Mr. Speaker, the House unanimously passed a version of this bill just last week, and now that the Senate has made some technical changes, we are here to pass it once again and send it to President Trump’s desk so it can be-come law. H.R. 6615 will reauthorize the CDC’s traumatic brain injury initiatives, and establish a national concussion surveil-lance system. This surveillance system will be able to accurately determine how many Americans, both children and adults, get a concussion each year, and the cause of that concussion. This data would provide real benefits to public health officials and patients in local communities and States across the country as we seek to better under-stand traumatic brain injury and best practices surrounding these injuries. I know all too well from personal ex-perience—I have a brother who was in-jured in a motorcycle accident and suf-fered pretty severe TBI—as somebody who has dealt with that, continues to, and works with men and women in uni-form and those in my district, this is important legislation. It will help bring hope and better health outcomes for people who suffer from TBI and maybe even prevent a few of those inju-ries along the way. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-self such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Senate amendment to H.R. 6615, the Traumatic Brain Injury Program Reau-thorization Act of 2018, led by Con-gressman PASCRELL and Congressman R
OONEY . This legislation would reauthorize programs at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that would work to reduce the incidence of trau-matic brain injury in the United States. These programs also help improve our understanding of the prevention and treatment of traumatic brain inju-ries through surveillance efforts. This reauthorization would expand upon existing efforts to reauthorize CDC to establish a new national con-cussion surveillance system to deter-mine the prevalence and the incidence of concussions in the United States. I commend the sponsors of this bill and the work they have done. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. B
URGESS ), the chairman of our Subcommittee on Health, who has done so much work on the cause of good public policy related to healthcare. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for the recognition. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6615, the Traumatic Brain Injury Pro-gram Reauthorization Act. For those watching last week, the House passed this bill by a voice vote. Now our Senate counterparts have passed the bill with a small amend-ment. It is important to note that should this bill pass the Chamber today, as I believe it will, the legisla-tion will be sent to President Trump’s desk and signed into law. I thank our House leaders on this bill, Representative B
ILLPASCRELL and Representative T
HOMAS ROONEY , for pushing this important initiative. This legislation reauthorizes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention trau-matic brain injury initiatives. The aggregation of these programs that will be reauthorized by this legis-lation provide much hope to the indi-viduals and families who are affected by traumatic brain injury. We still have a lot to learn about the risks and the short- and long-term effects of traumatic brain injury. This legisla-tion will help increase our goal of in-creasing knowledge, awareness, and treatment of traumatic brain injury. Once again, I thank my colleagues for supporting this legislation last week, nearly identical legislation, now sent back to us from the Senate with a small amendment, and I urge passage. Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. PAS-
CRELL ), who has done tremendous work on this issue. Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6615, the Traumatic Brain In-jury Program Reauthorization Act of 2018. I join the traumatic brain injury community in expressing my gratitude to both Chairman W
ALDEN and our in-coming Chairman F
RANK PALLONE for their work to swiftly move this impor-tant legislation forward. Millions of Americans living with a traumatic brain injury can be assured that better treatments and potential cures are in the not too distant future. While the House passed legislation unanimously just last week, the Senate made some minor changes that are both welcome and nonsubstantive be-fore they passed the bill yesterday. There is one semantic change that does not have any impact on defini-tions or programs, as well as a regroup-ing of funding in the Centers for Dis-ease Control and Prevention TBI budg-et. While the bill includes the same amount of funding that was included before, it will give the CDC more flexi-bility to use and sustain their funding to implement the National Concussion Surveillance System. As the lead spon-sor of this bill, I fought hard to ensure it contain the increase in funding that we secured in the fiscal year 2018 omni-bus, as well as enough funding for CDC to finally be able to implement the Na-tion’s first surveillance program. I might add to the Speaker and to Mr. W
ALDEN , back in 1999 and 2000, when we put the task force together with Jim Greenwood from Pennsyl-vania, this was our first objective. After 20 years—we are slow learners— we finally got it done. This is going to be a big help to researchers and doctors throughout the United States of Amer-ica. The CDC has wanted to implement this for years. This funding will finally allow them to capture the full picture of brain injury so that we can better understand the breadth and depth of

the problem and use that to work to-wards solutions. Helping people who have suffered these catastrophic injuries is not a po-litical subject. There is no Democratic or Republican way to treat a traumatic brain injury. I am pleased that we have strong sponsors and support from both parties on both sides of the aisle. When I co-founded the Congressional Brain Injury Task Force in 2001, Mem-bers, including me, were unaware of the extent and impact of TBI—I will be very frank with you. Today, we fulfill decades-long work from tireless advo-cates to bolster our Federal agencies, States, and local providers. They de-serve Federal resources to provide the support and breakthrough research necessary to put an end to this condi-tion. The TBI Act reauthorization will help servicemembers on and off the battlefield, athletes on the ball field, and children and families across the country who are living with brain inju-ries. We have a long way to go, but the journey forward is clearer today with the passage of this bill. Mr. Speaker, I commend Senator H
ATCH and Senator C ASEY for quickly advancing this important legislation in the Senate. I will continue working with them and my co-chair, T
OMROO-
NEY, to ensure this legislation is soon signed by the President. Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I again encourage Members to support this legislation. As was indicated, it has taken a long 20 years to achieve this success. Hopefully, we can support this and provide, again, a great initia-tive on behalf of those who suffer from traumatic brain injury. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, this is really important work. Again, I commend Mr. P
ASCRELL  for his incredible efforts on this initia-tive. I know it has taken 20 years. I might say, maybe it just took the right chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee to get it done finally, but it is probably more than that. But I just want to say, this will bring hope. It will bring better health out-comes and will save lives with this leg-islation as well. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. b1530 The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to re-vise and extend their remarks and in-sert extraneous material in the R
ECORD  on the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Oregon? There was no objection. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 2076, the BOLD Infrastructure for Alz-heimer’s Act. I would like to thank Representative B
RETT GUTHRIE from Kentucky for his work to bring this bill to the House floor and for his terrific partnership as a member and real leader on our En-ergy and Commerce Committee. Now, the BOLD Act is another bipar-tisan bill. It will enhance our Nation’s public health infrastructure. It will im-prove lives for patients. More than 5 million Americans have Alzheimer’s. It is the most expensive disease in our country. It costs our health system hundreds of billions of dollars each and every year, and those numbers are only going up. This legislation before us now will help us address those trends by estab-lishing centers of excellence to im-prove coordination of care with local

public health departments for patients in our communities. These centers will increase data collection, analysis, and timely reporting to better inform re-searchers and policymakers across the country. For patients and their families, early intervention and coordination of care provided at these centers can make the burden of Alzheimer’s just a little bit lighter. I have heard about the importance of the bill from Marya in Medford, who, in 2012, became one of the 180,000 Orego-nians who serve as unpaid Alzheimer’s caregivers for a loved one. In her case, that loved one was her father. When her father was diagnosed, she was faced with not only a daunting sys-tem and difficult choices to make with-out information, but also an unex-pected cost of care of $342,000, on aver-age. According to Marya, if passed, the BOLD Act would ensure States such as Oregon have the resources necessary to support earlier detection and diagnosis of Alzheimer’s and help healthcare givers like her to grapple with this dev-astating disease. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of patients and their families across our Nation, I urge my colleagues to join me in pass-ing this important legislation as well. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-self such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the BOLD Infrastructure for Alz-heimer’s Act, legislation that I have introduced with my good friend and fel-low Energy and Commerce Committee member, Congressman B
RETT GUTHRIE . I thank both Chairman W
ALDEN and incoming Chair P
ALLONE for their sup-port of this particular legislation, and I greatly appreciate the partnership with Congressman G
UTHRIE and his staff for helping to get this important legislation over the finish line today. Alzheimer’s is a brutal, devastating disease. Anyone whose life has been touched by Alzheimer’s or related de-mentias knows the heart-wrenching toll that these diseases can and most often do take on an individual, on a family, and on a community. Since first coming to Congress, I have been laser-focused on how we can reduce the devastating burden that Alzheimer’s disease has on our families and our Nation. We have had great suc-cess, many successes in recent years with legislation such as the National Alzheimer’s Project Act and the Alz-heimer’s Accountability Act helping to coordinate our medical research agen-da and strengthen our case for the un-precedented investments that Congress has appropriated to effectively treat and find a cure for Alzheimer’s. With the HOPE for Alzheimer’s Act, we were able to get CMS to provide coverage for comprehensive care plan-ning services to Medicare beneficiaries and their caregivers following a diag-nosis of Alzheimer’s disease. These care planning visits are a critical tool for families struggling for answers and help to lessen the burden of this dis-ease. Now we are taking another huge step forward with the passage of the BOLD Infrastructure for Alzheimer’s Act, leg-islation that will invest in public health-oriented strategies for tackling Alzheimer’s disease and related demen-tias. We know that in 2018, Alzheimer’s and related dementias will cost our country $277 billion. By smartly invest-ing in a public health infrastructure for this disease, we can reduce this cost burden on the local, State, and Federal Government, and improve care for those who have received an Alzheimer’s diagnosis. The BOLD Act will enhance our pub-lic health infrastructure in three main ways: First, it will create Alzheimer’s dis-ease and related dementias public health centers of excellence. They will be dedicated to promoting effective Alzheimer’s disease and caregiving interventions, as well as educating the public on Alzheimer’s disease, cog-nitive decline, and brain health. These centers will implement the CDC’s healthy aging public health road map and will take key steps to support health and social services profes-sionals, as well as families and commu-nities. Second, the legislation will allow for State and local cooperative agreements with HHS that will be awarded to State health departments, subdivisions of States, or Tribal entities to develop and carry out Alzheimer’s interven-tions. These awards will help States build a foundation and also help those States that are already investing in a public health approach to Alzheimer’s to amplify their initiatives through public-private partnerships. Finally, the BOLD Act will create data analysis and reporting coopera-tive agreements with HHS that will en-sure that data on Alzheimer’s, cog-nitive decline, caregiving, and health disparities are analyzed and dissemi-nated to the public in a timely manner. We need this legislation more than ever. The burden of Alzheimer’s disease does not take a day off, and Congress cannot afford to either. In closing, I again thank Chairman W
ALDEN , Ranking Member P ALLONE , House leadership, our Senate sponsors, and everyone who had a hand in this success today. Without such dedicated bipartisan Alzheimer’s champions throughout Congress, we would not be making this strong step forward. It is mighty progress. Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my col-leagues to support this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I want to commend the gentleman from New York for his leadership on this issue as well. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. B
URGESS ), so that he can speak on the legislation. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for the recognition, and I rise to speak in support of S. 2076, the BOLD Infrastructure for Alzheimer’s Act. This bill was introduced on the Sen-ate side by Senator SUSAN COLLINS and Senator C
ATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO , and it promotes public awareness of Alz-heimer’s disease and related demen-tias. But I also need to thank the cham-pions on the House side of this legisla-tion, Representatives B
RETT GUTHRIE  and P
AUL TONKO , both valuable mem-bers of the Health Subcommittee. Alzheimer’s is a devastating disease that affects families across our Nation. Every 65 seconds, another person in the United States develops Alzheimer’s. Alzheimer’s is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States, with one in three seniors dying of Alzheimer’s or a related dementia. Over the past several years, Congress has doubled down on its commitment to researching Alzheimer’s disease and the related dementias by substantially increasing our appropriations for the initiatives housed at the National In-stitutes of Health. This legislation will require the Sec-retary of the Department of Health and Human Services to work with the Cen-ters for Disease Control and Prevention to award grants, contracts, or coopera-tive agreements to establish or support regional centers to address Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. The pur-pose of these centers of excellence is to increase awareness among public health officials, healthcare profes-sionals, and the public as it relates to Alzheimer’s disease and the related de-mentias. By empowering our healthcare work-force, and our patients with more in-formation, there will be increasing awareness of the disease, the impact it has on individuals’ lives, and the possi-bility of treatments or interventions. The effects of this disease are daunting for both the individual and for their families. This bill is a step to-ward building an infrastructure to sup-port the ever-growing population of in-dividuals with Alzheimer’s and their related dementias. I support S. 2076, and I urge my fel-low Members to do the same. Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ken-tucky (Mr. G
UTHRIE ), another leader on healthcare in the Energy and Com-merce Committee. Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my legislation, the BOLD Infrastructure for Alzheimer’s Act. It has been great to work with my good friend from New York (Mr. T
ONKO ). We came here together as classmates in the 2008 election. We worked together because we wanted to create a public health infrastructure to help those with Alzheimer’s and other

dementias receive the care they so des-perately need. Over 5 million Americans are living with Alzheimer’s and other dementias, making it the most costly disease in America. In the Second District, I have met countless Kentuckians who have been affected by this disease in some way. I, too, have shared similar experi-ences with a great-uncle, when I was a child, having early onset Alzheimer’s and seeing my family having to try to understand and deal with it. When I was a child, it wasn’t understood as well as it is even now. I watched my wife’s grandfather go through it and saw my mother-in-law being the primary caretaker and saw how it consumes the family. So what it does to the person with the disease, what it does to the family caring for the disease is of utmost im-portance in trying to move towards a cure. But, also, it is fiscally responsible what we are doing today because, by 2050, it is estimated it will cost the Federal Government over $1 trillion if we do not have some advances in car-ing for and delaying this onset. I used to say that is for my children and my grandchildren and my great- grandchildren, but, actually, in 30 years, I will be in my eighties, so it will be affecting my children. So we need to move forward, and it is fiscally responsible to do so. The BOLD Infrastructure for Alz-heimer’s Act would direct the CDC to establish a network to support the pre-vention, treatment, and care of Alz-heimer’s disease. In doing so, we hope to take care of those who have Alz-heimer’s and other dementias now and, hopefully, find a cure for these debili-tating diseases in the near future. This important bill has passed the Senate. I urge my colleagues to sup-port it today, and I look forward to seeing the President sign this bill into law. Before I close, I do want to thank all the staff for their hard work. This leg-islation wouldn’t be done without them. Sophie Trainor in my office has worked tirelessly on this and other bills at the end of this session, and I appreciate her assistance and help. Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. B
ILIRAKIS ) to speak on the legisla-tion. b1545 Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding me the time. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 2076. I thank my good friend, B
RETT GUTHRIE from the great State of Kentucky, and also Mr. T
ONKO for sponsoring the House bill. This is so very important. The Building Our Largest Dementia Infrastructure for Alzheimer’s Act, or the BOLD Infra-structure for Alzheimer’s Act, is so very important. This bill will create Alzheimer’s disease centers of excel-lence, which are badly needed. Through these centers and public health departments, we can strengthen our efforts at increasing early detec-tion and diagnosis. It will also allow for the voluntary collection of data so researchers can analyze cognitive de-cline, caregiving, and health dispari-ties in a timely manner. I know that is going to help so much in finding a cure for this disease. I am a cosponsor of the House version of the bill. In the Tampa area, we have the Byrd Alzheimer’s Center and Research Insti-tute, which is one of the largest free-standing Alzheimer’s research centers in the United States. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. GUTHRIE ). The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gen-tleman from Florida. Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, this bill will help them in their efforts of Alzheimer’s awareness and research. Please support this bill. We need it badly for our constituents. I appreciate all the help from all the volunteers and the advocates. Again, I urge strong support for this bill. Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. M
AXINE WATERS ). Representative W
ATERS is from California’s 43rd Con-gressional District and has invested a lot of time and work on the Alz-heimer’s issue, especially in her role as co-chair of the Congressional Task Force on Alzheimer’s Disease. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Congressman T
ONKO for the leadership that he has provided and the oppor-tunity to rise to urge all of my col-leagues to support S. 2076, the BOLD Infrastructure for Alzheimer’s Act. I congratulate Senator S
USAN COL-
LINS for shepherding this bill through the Senate. I join together with my colleagues, Representatives B
RETT  G
UTHRIE , P AUL TONKO , and C HRIS S
MITH, to introduce the House version of this bill in order to promote early detection and diagnosis, support care-givers, and reduce health disparities re-lated to the care and treatment of Alz-heimer’s patients. As the House Democratic co-chair of the bipartisan, bicameral Congres-sional Task Force on Alzheimer’s Dis-ease, I know how devastating this dis-ease can be for patients, families, and caregivers. Alzheimer’s affects more than 5 million Americans, and it is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States. There is no effective treatment, no means of prevention, and no method for slowing the progression of the disease. Alzheimer’s is very costly to society. In 2017, the direct cost of care for Alz-heimer’s and other dementias was ap-proximately $259 billion, with 67 per-cent of those costs paid by Medicare or Medicaid. At the current rate, the di-rect costs of care for these tragic con-ditions will reach more than $1 trillion by 2050. Most Alzheimer’s patients require constant care and attention, especially when they are in the final stages of the disease. More than 15 million Ameri-cans provide unpaid care to family and friends living with Alzheimer’s and other dementias. The Alzheimer’s As-sociation calculated that caregivers provided more than 18 billion hours of unpaid care for people with dementia in 2016, at an estimated value of more than $230 billion. Alzheimer’s has a devastating impact on caregivers. Compared with care-givers for people without dementia, twice as many caregivers for people with dementia indicate substantial emotional, financial, and physical stress. The BOLD Infrastructure for Alz-heimer’s Act establishes Alzheimer’s centers of excellence around the coun-try to expand and promote innovative and effective Alzheimer’s interven-tions. These interventions will support early detection, reduce the risk of hos-pitalizations and cognitive decline, support caregivers, and reduce health disparities. The BOLD Act will also im-prove data collection on the incidence and prevalence of Alzheimer’s and re-lated dementias. So, Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be here with my colleagues today, and I would certainly urge all of my col-leagues to support this important leg-islation. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, may I in-quire as to how much time remains on each side. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-tleman from Oregon has 121⁄2minutes remaining. The gentleman from New York has 12 minutes remaining. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. C
ARTER ), who is a pharmacist on our committee and a great leader on health issues on the Energy and Commerce Committee. Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-er, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 2076, the BOLD Infrastructure for Alzheimer’s Act, because of what it does to address this terrible disease. According to the Alzheimer’s Associa-tion, nearly 5.7 million Americans are currently living with Alzheimer’s. It is currently the sixth leading cause of death in our country. This debilitating disease continues to grow amongst our population, but we still struggle to understand and find a cure. But there is hope. This legisla-tion would award agreements to estab-lish national and regional centers of excellence focused on Alzheimer’s dis-ease, as well as support State public health departments, tribes, and others working to fight this.

This disease impacts not only those who have it but also the millions of caregivers responsible for the well- being of those who have Alzheimer’s. These are often family members or close friends who have to make sac-rifices in their own lives to care for others. This legislation will make great strides in better understanding the cognitive decline associated with the disease, the impact on caregivers, and how we can continue to fight for a cure. I am a proud cosponsor of H.R. 4256, the companion bill in the House that was introduced by my good friend and colleague, Mr. G
UTHRIE of Kentucky. I also want to thank those across the country who have continued to be tire-less advocates on this issue, including Ms. Donna Camacho who has been a leader on this issue in my district. I can’t overstate my appreciation for all of the hard work and dedication that so many people have poured into passing this legislation. Today, with this passage, we can help bring about hope in the future for those who are victims of this disease, like my legislative director’s grand-mother, Lisa Verlsteffen, a courageous woman who lived a long and happy life, but who eventually succumbed to the effects of Alzheimer’s after a long and hard fight. While today’s work isn’t the final so-lution, it brings us one step closer in the fight to eradicate this disease. I urge my colleagues to support this leg-islation and vote ‘‘yes’’ on its passage. Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-self the balance of my time to close. Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge passage of this legislation. The BOLD Act is another bit of foundation that we have done to move forward and conquer Alz-heimer’s and related dementias. Those of us who function in govern-ment understand full well that our Federal, State, and local budgets have been impacted severely by Alzheimer’s disease, but, most importantly, fami-lies have been burdened by this disease. So it is so important for us to move forward with this legislation that pro-vides, again, hope to those families and individuals living with Alzheimer’s dis-ease. Mr. Speaker, I ask for support of the legislation, and I yield back the bal-ance of my time. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I, too, join my friend and colleague from New York and our friends across the build-ing in the Senate in support of the BOLD Act, S. 2076. Mr. Speaker, I urge our colleagues to support it, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. C

GENERAL LEAVE  
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and in-sert extraneous materials in the R
ECORD on the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Oregon? There was no objection. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 2278, the State Offices of Rural Health Reauthorization Act led by Sen-ator P
ATROBERTS and by my Energy and Commerce Committee colleagues Representative M
ARKWAYNE MULLIN of Oklahoma and my fellow Oregonian, K
URTSCHRADER , here in the House. This important legislation reauthor-izes and enhances Federal grants to States for improving healthcare in rural areas through the operation of State Offices of Rural Health. Now, in my home State of Oregon, the Oregon Office of Rural Health has been the coordinating body for frontier health since the 1970s. This office part-ners with the Oregon Health & Sciences University to improve the de-livery of statewide resources to rural areas, such as the Second District. Telehealth, rotational programs for medical students in rural communities, and recruitment of healthcare pro-viders are just a few examples of the Oregon Office of Rural Health’s work to help patients in Oregon’s rural areas. I am proud of the great work that they do, and this bill will enhance their ability and those of all State Rural Health Offices to equip communities with the tools they need to strengthen the delivery of healthcare in rural and underserved areas. So, Mr. Speaker, I strongly support passage of this legislation. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes,’’ and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-self such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 2278, the State Offices of Rural Health Reauthorization Act of 2018. I thank Chair W
ALDEN and incoming Chair P
ALLONE , along with Congressman S
CHRADER and Congressman M ULLIN , for their work on this important legis-lation. This legislation would reauthorize the Federal grant program that sup-ports Offices of Rural Health in each State, including the Charles D. Cook Office of Rural Health with the New York State Department of Health for the first time. These offices assist States in strengthening rural health delivery systems and improving access to qual-ity services in rural areas. This work is particularly important because pa-tients and providers in rural commu-nities can face obstacles that can: re-sult in reduced access to care, increase health disparities, and inhibit individ-uals from experiencing optimal health. To ensure that States can continue to meet the requirements of this grant program, this reauthorization legisla-tion provides new flexibility for State offices to meet their Federal match re-quirements, as well as to request a waiver that would allow the State of-fice to continue to receive Federal funding if an office faces an extreme hardship in meeting that requirement. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support S. 2278, and I reserve the bal-ance of my time. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Okla-homa (Mr. MULLIN ), who is a cosponsor of this very important legislation. Mr. MULLIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in favor of my bill, the State Of-fices of Rural Health Reauthorization Act of 2018. There is a healthcare crisis right now going on in rural America. Rural hos-pitals are closing their doors at an alarming rate. Eighty-five rural hos-pitals have closed since 2010, and 673 are vulnerable to close at any time. More closures are coming, and Con-gress needs to start making changes to ensure that rural Americans have the healthcare they need. My bill, the State Offices of Rural Health Reauthorization Act, will help Oklahoma’s rural hospitals keep their doors open by reauthorizing the Okla-homa Office of Rural Health. This of-fice provides a valuable resource to the hospitals of Oklahoma by helping hos-pitals explore innovative and collabo-rative ideas that can lead to improve-ments and savings. Mr. Speaker, I would be remiss not to mention that awesome sweater-vest that you are wearing. So in the spirit of Christmas, I believe you just pull that off. Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. S
CHRA -
DER), who represents Oregon’s Fifth Congressional District. Mr. SCHRADER. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of the State Offices of Rural Health Reauthorization Act. Since 1979, as alluded to before, Or-egon’s Office of Rural Health has pro-vided services critical to the folks in the rural portion of my State. Thirty- six percent of Oregonians live in rural communities, and as we know, these communities often face challenges not experienced in urban or suburban set-tings. b1600 People in rural areas might have long distances to travel over mountainous terrain just to see their doctor, or they might have issues even finding a pri-mary care provider or specialist who can help them where and when they need it. That is why we need the Of-fices of Rural Health and why the House should pass this bill today. Oregonians have come to rely on the services and expertise of the Oregon Of-fice of Rural Health to help build up the healthcare in rural areas so folks in these communities know they will be able to see a doctor, nurse practi-tioner, or other healthcare profes-sional. The Office of Rural Health has worked with small hospitals and EMS providers to ensure that patients are safe, the ethics are up to code, and they can work through the often chal-lenging patchwork of programs and regulation. My State’s Office of Rural Health has also been instrumental in providing the data and policy expertise we have need-ed to ensure that all Oregonians re-ceive the care that the Affordable Care Act and Oregon’s healthcare trans-formation projects have promised. Everyone, including folks in our rural areas, should have access to qual-ity healthcare. This bill provides the Federal support and resources nec-essary to ensure that all 50 States’ Of-fices of Rural Health can be there for the patients who need them. I am proud to have led on this bill in the House with my good friend, MARKWAYNE MULLIN . I am grateful to Chairman W
ALDEN and Ranking Mem-ber P
ALLONE for getting this to the floor before the end of a very inter-esting session. I thank them for their leadership on this issue and urge sup-port for this bill. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. B
URGESS ), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Health. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I also want to rise in support of S. 2278, the State Offices of Rural Health Reau-thorization Act of 2018. This bill, which was introduced by Senators P
AT ROBERTS and H EIDI H
EITKAMP , reauthorizes grants to State Offices of Rural Health. I also need to thank our House cham-pion of this effort, Representative M
ARKWAYNE MULLIN , a valuable mem-ber of the Health Subcommittee. This legislation already passed the Senate, and today we have the oppor-tunity to pass it on the floor of the House and send it down to the Presi-dent for his signature. The majority of counties in the United States are rural. While urban and suburban counties are growing in population, certainly in my own com-munity back in the 26th District of Texas, we have a significant percentage of the population living in rural areas. Citizens of rural America reap many benefits of their communities, but they

are also faced with unique challenges, particularly when it comes to healthcare. S. 2278 will enable States to maintain and improve upon healthcare in rural areas by reauthorizing grants to State Offices of Rural Health. Grantees will be required to maintain a clearinghouse for collecting and dis-seminating information on rural healthcare issues, research related to rural healthcare, as well as innovative approaches to rural healthcare deliv-ery. The grantees will also be tasked with identifying both Federal and State programs to address rural health and to provide technical assistance to public and nonprofit private entities regarding participation in these pro-grams. State Offices of Rural Health provide much value to the 57 million Ameri-cans that live in these areas around the country. Many of us represent towns and counties that are largely depend-ent upon the strength of rural Members of Congress. For these reasons, I ask Members to join me in supporting S. 2278. Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-self the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support, again, of the legislation before us. I want to commend Congressmen S
CHRADER and M ULLIN for their great work on this important legislation. It shows great sensitivity to the healthcare needs of rural America and to the corresponding health delivery systems. For that reason alone, this is worthy of our unanimous support. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I, too, want to thank Members on both sides of the aisle, my colleagues who have worked so hard on this legislation, and, frankly, our friends in the Senate, as well, who worked with us on this. We are glad to bring this to a conclusion and another very important healthcare bill will make its way to the President’s desk. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. W
AL-

GENERAL LEAVE  
Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unani-mous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to re-vise and extend their remarks and in-clude extraneous material on H.R. 7279. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Ohio? There was no objection. Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-self such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am here today to ex-press strong support for my bill, H.R. 7279, the Water Infrastructure Improve-ment Act, and ask my colleagues to join the bipartisan coalition that worked on this legislation to pass it. I introduced this bill to help codify into law a useful tool our communities should have at their disposal called in-tegrated planning. Integrated planning provides flexibility for communities when they are confronted with the re-alities of managing wastewater and stormwater systems. Cities and other municipalities are charged with deliv-ering those water utility services to their residents. Those same municipalities face the challenges of regulatory mandates from the Environmental Protection Agency for wastewater and stormwater systems. They also face the rising costs of these mandates, which can become severe financial burdens in repairing or replacing aging water infrastructure. These financial burdens ultimately fall on the ratepayers: the residents of those municipalities, many of whom cannot afford dramatic and immediate increases in their monthly bill. With-out flexibility and the ability to prioritize projects so public health and environmental benefits can be maxi-mized, local governments may be forced into costly consent decrees. Integrated planning helps commu-nities sequence their water projects to meet regulatory or safety obligations more affordably. Cities can use inte-grated planning to focus on projects that will actually deliver safe and af-fordable water utility services rather than simply focusing on regulations and red tape. The Water Infrastructure Improve-ment Act also creates an important po-sition inside the EPA, the Office of Mu-nicipal Ombudsman, to assist munici-palities in implementing Agency policy and ensuring local governments are ad-hering to their responsibilities under the Clean Water Act while utilizing in-tegrated planning. This bill enjoys bipartisan support in Congress and support from the Na-tional Association of Clean Water Agencies, the U.S. Conference of May-ors, the National League of Cities, the American Public Works Association, the National Association of Counties, and the National Association of Re-gional Councils. The Water Infrastructure Improve-ment Act offers a way forward for our communities to take a comprehensive approach to repairing or replacing out-dated water systems, to delivering clean and sustainable water services, and to keeping it affordable for the ratepayers and taxpayers. We all tend to get wrapped up in the headlines of the day. The nonstop calls for outrage dominate cable news, and partisan differences grab everyone’s at-tention. Because of that, the American people very rarely hear or see the real bipartisan work on issues important to their everyday lives like easy access to safe, affordable, and efficient water utilities. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my col-league from California (Mrs. N

TANO ) for her work on this issue. This is an example of the many issues in Congress that affect the lives of all Americans and that find bipartisan support, yet fly under the radar. I strongly urge my colleagues to join me, Mrs. N
APOLITANO , Mr. L ATTA , Ms. F
UDGE , Mr. C HABOT , and Mrs. B USTOS in passing the Water Infrastructure Im-provement Act so America’s munici-palities and their residents can main-tain access to safe water. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may con-sume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 7279, the very bipartisan, as my colleague was saying, Water Infrastruc-ture Improvement Act. Let me first start by thanking the primary sponsor of the bill, the gen-tleman from Ohio (Mr. G
IBBS), for his great cooperation on this. Let me say that it was a pleasure doing it, and I associate myself with his remarks. It is very bipartisan and something that we all agree on that needs to happen for the people of this Nation to finally reach a bipartisan agreement on this

very important issue after more than 4 years. This legislation codified the concept from the Obama administration known as integrated planning that can assist communities in meeting their require-ments under the Clean Water Act, while maintaining their obligation to achieve improvements in local water quality. EPA’s integrated planning frame-work provides communities with a vol-untary opportunity to prioritize local clean water investments with the greatest benefit to human health and the environment. This is incredibly im-portant to communities in my congres-sional district, as well as many others, as they meet the challenges of the Los Angeles County MS4 stormwater per-mit, and also across the Nation. To be clear, the integrated planning is not about diminishing communities’ existing obligations under the Clean Water Act; rather, it provides an op-portunity for communities to work with Federal and State regulators to optimize their clean water infrastruc-ture investments. The sad reality is that, until the Fed-eral Government increases its invest-ment under the Clean Water Act, com-munities will still struggle with afford-ability challenges. We can and must do better. First, we need to reauthorize the Clean Water State Revolving Fund, known as SRF, and I am hopeful that this is one of the first things we will accomplish next year on, again, a very bipartisan basis. We passed similar re-authorization of the drinking water program by voice vote in September. Now is the time for a similar effort to protect local water quality. Second, we need to address the cost of water and sewer services to these households with the least ability to pay. No hardworking American family should be forced to go without water and wastewater services simply be-cause their local rates are too high. Clean water is a basic human right. Yes, utilities should be able to re-cover the costs necessary to upgrade their local systems, but when those costs disproportionately affect indi-vidual households, we can and must do much more to help struggling families afford these basic services. That will be another issue I hope this next Congress will address in the com-ing year: protecting our Nation’s clean water and making it affordable for all American families. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gen-tleman from Ohio (Mr. L
ATTA ). Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, the gentleman from Ohio, for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 7279, the Water Infra-structure Improvement Act. Throughout my tenure in Congress, I have worked on legislation to give our Nation’s communities more flexibility to comply with costly regulations in regards to their wastewater infrastruc-ture improvements. In each Congress since 2008, I have introduced legislation that addresses these issues and pro-vides relief to our local communities. I have heard from many villages, towns, and cities across my district over the years that struggle to meet wastewater and stormwater improve-ment demands. This legislation is a key step to build on the work I have previously done to provide relief to our constituents by allowing them to more effectively and efficiently meet their specific water needs. b1615 There are billions of dollars worth of water, wastewater, and stormwater in-frastructure needs in the State of Ohio. It is critical to provide communities with the ability to meet their obliga-tions in a more cost-effective manner. This legislation will codify the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency In-tegrated Planning Framework and pro-vide additional tools and flexibility for communities to comply with mandated wastewater infrastructure improve-ment projects. This is important because it allows municipalities and clean water utili-ties to decide how best to spend their limited resources. Integrated planning allows communities to allocate funds in a targeted manner, allowing them to focus on the most effective water qual-ity improvements. Mr. Speaker, again, I want to thank my colleague Representative GIBBS, as well as Representatives C
HABOT , N
APOLITANO , FUDGE , and B USTOS for working together to get this bipartisan piece of legislation passed. I will con-tinue to work with my colleagues in both chambers to ensure that this bi-partisan bill reaches the President’s desk in order to help improve our Na-tion’s water infrastructure and protect the ratepayers. I urge all my colleagues to support this measure, and, again, I thank my colleague for introducing the legisla-tion. Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gen-tleman from Ohio (Mr. C
HABOT ). Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in very strong support of H.R. 7279, the Water Infrastructure Improve-ment Act. I want to thank Congressman G
IBBS as well as Congressman L
ATTA , who just spoke previously, Congresswoman F
UDGE , and a number of others with whom we have been working, literally for years now, to move forward inte-grated planning and provide more flexi-bility for local communities to meet clean water standards. The legislation that we are working on and that we have been involved in here, I think, is critical for commu-nities like mine—Cincinnati, Hamilton County—and communities all over the country. I want to say a special thanks to Hamilton County Commissioner Todd Portune, who is a Democrat, and Coun-ty Commissioner Chris Monzel, who is a Republican, in my district. We have been working in a bipartisan manner on this for quite some time now. Com-missioner Portune brought this to my attention a number of years ago as Hamilton County dealt with the EPA consent decree that they had entered into many years ago that has literally crippled the sewer system and has caused dramatic price increases for the ratepayers, hundreds of thousands of whom are my constituents. Commissioner Portune helped to craft the early versions of this legisla-tion, and he and Commissioner Monzel have continued to fight to push this legislation across the finish line. Oftentimes, when I see Todd Portune back in my area, he will bring this up to me and encourage me. We have been in this together for a long time now, and Commissioner Monzel as well. I, again, especially want to thank Con-gressman GIBBS for pushing this for many years now. I am so glad that we are actually finally getting there. The legislation that we are consid-ering today will authorize the EPA to work with local communities on inte-grated clean water plans that incor-porate flexibility and innovative ap-proaches. It will also allow integrated plans to be used to modify administra-tive orders or consent decrees, and it will allow compliance schedules that are longer than the current permit pe-riods, if the jurisdiction meets its State water quality standards. That is the important thing. We want more flexibility to give local commu-nities the ability to deal with their problems in a way that makes sense in that community. The problems that New York City has are very different from what a rural Mississippi district or my district, Cincinnati, would have. They are all a bit different. What we are saying is that you still have to meet those high standards that the EPA sets for clean water. We want our people to drink clean water, but we should give those different commu-nities more flexibility so that they can do what makes sense in their par-ticular community and then save the ratepayers their hard-earned tax dol-lars. That is what this is all about, main-taining the high standards that we have, but doing it in a way that allows for more flexibility; the local commu-nities can act according to what is in their best interest. Together, these commonsense pro-posals represent a critical first step in addressing this issue as we continue to work on further financial capability guidance so that communities can meet clean water standards in a fis-cally responsible manner. I, again, want to thank the chairman and the ranking member for their lead-ership on this and for moving this bill

forward. I thank all of the Members who have played a part in this process. It has been a long time coming. A lot of people have worked very hard on this, and I just want to thank all of those who have done this in a bipar-tisan manner. I would love to see this House work this way even more. We will see. Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank, first of all, our respective staffs for working together on this. They did a great job, and they did an awful lot of work on it. Mr. C
HABOT is right; it has been a long time coming. I have been on the Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment more than 20 years, and this is something that came up over 10 years ago that EPA was forcing Cali-fornia restrictions. And California has the strictest rules on air and water. So this is really an efficient way of being able to help California and other States deal with it. This bill before us is a very good first step toward ensuring the protection of our Nation’s rivers, lakes, and streams and deserves our very strong support. We have worked with cities, mayors, water agencies, sanitation districts, environmental groups, as well as our colleagues on the other side on this legislation. We are aware of no opposi-tion—none—to this bill. We thank all stakeholders for their input and support throughout this process. However, it is my hope that early in the next Congress we can return to the House floor with similar bipartisan leg-islation to address the funding needs and affordability concerns we discussed earlier. Only then can we say we have delivered on our responsibility to pro-vide clean, safe, and affordable water to all American families, including Na-tive Americans. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-self such time as I may consume. I want to, again, thank my colleague from California, Mrs. N
APOLITANO , for all her help on the other side of the aisle to make this a very bipartisan bill. It is a very commonsense bill. The key to this that I think needs to be mentioned and emphasized is it gives our local communities flexibility and also encourages all levels of gov-ernment to work together—the Federal EPA, the State EPA, and the local mu-nicipalities—to solve the problems they have at the ground level. Also in this bill, there is a provision that requires that the new position, the EPA ombudsman, in at least 2 years re-port back to Congress, the T&I Com-mittee, about what happened with the integrated planning, the specific projects, and review that and see if it needs to be tweaked or not. We will see how it works. It is very important, working to-gether. You see communities that have been under court orders, court decrees, and they can’t get to where they need to get to, and this bill gives them that flexibility and that common sense. Everybody wants to do the right thing, and this will help them do that and to be working with the EPA in a partnership. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 7279, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. GIBBS) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 7279. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. MASSIE. Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not present. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-ceedings on this question will be post-poned. The point of no quorum is considered withdrawn.

GENERAL LEAVE  
Mr. HURD. Mr. Speaker, I ask unani-mous consent that all Members may have 5 days in which to revise and ex-tend their remarks and include extra-neous material on the bill under con-sideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. HURD. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-self such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the SECURE Technology Act. This is a bill that I introduced with the ma-jority leader, K
EVIN MCCARTHY , and Representatives R
ATCLIFFE , L IEU, V
ELA, and L ANGEVIN . This bill includes two bipartisan pro-posals to strengthen Homeland Secu-rity. First, it requires a vulnerability disclosure policy and establishes a bug bounty program at the Department of Homeland Security. Second, it estab-lishes requirements for supply chain security in products purchased by the Federal Government. Title I of the bill incorporates H.R. 6735, which is the Public-Private Cyber-security Cooperation Act, which was introduced by Leader M
CCARTHY and passed by a voice vote by this House in September. It is cosponsored by myself and Representatives R
ATCLIFFE , LAN-
GEVIN , and K HANNA . Senator P
ORTMAN introduced the Senate companion to this bill, S. 3707, with Senator H
ASSAN . This title seeks to protect the infor-mation systems of the Department of Homeland Security by establishing a program to report security vulnerabili-ties discovered on these systems. This program allows DHS to learn about se-curity risks from private-sector ex-perts and requires DHS to fix these at- risk systems. DHS operates many of the systems and services other agencies use to pro-tect their networks, so DHS should set the example for securing its own infor-mation systems. Title I also includes S. 1281, the Hack the Department of Homeland Security Act of 2018, which was introduced by Senator H
ASSAN with Senators P
ORTMAN , M CCASKILL , H ARRIS , and G
ARDNER . Representative L
IEUintroduced the House companion to this bill, H.R. 2774, with Representative T
AYLOR . It is co-sponsored by Representatives M
EEHAN , K
HANNA , JAYAPAL , KILMER , KELLY , and E
VANS . The bill authorizes DHS to cre-ate a bug bounty pilot program to com-pensate people who report security vul-nerabilities to DHS. Bug bounties are widely seen as an effective and inexpensive way to iden-tify vulnerabilities in IT systems. Title II of this bill incorporates S. 3085, the Federal Acquisition Supply Chain Security Act of 2018, which was introduced by Senator MCCASKILL and cosponsored by Senators L
ANKFORD and J
OHNSON . This bill passed the Senate by unani-mous consent last night. This title helps ensure the integrity of informa-tion technology and communications equipment purchased by the Federal Government by addressing supply chain risks that are government-wide. The bill sets up an interagency coun-cil to identify products that pose unac-ceptable risk to these systems and to set policy on information sharing and risk mitigation in Federal IT systems. The bill recognizes the need to move away from an ad hoc approach to deal-ing with unacceptable products offered to the Federal Government by compa-nies such as Kaspersky, ZTE, and Huawei. It also authorizes exclusion and removal orders for products found to pose an unacceptable risk to these Federal IT systems. This legislation provides for due process, including judicial review, and certainty about how lawsuits will be handled in the future. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the nu-merous Members in the House and Sen-ate who worked tirelessly on these two pieces of legislation, especially Leader M
CCARTHY , members of the House Committee on Oversight and Govern-ment Reform and Committee on Home-land Security, and members of the Sen-ate Homeland Security and Govern-mental Affairs Committee. Mr. Speaker, I want to urge my col-leagues to support the SECURE Tech-nology Act, and I reserve the balance of my time. b1630 Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend, Representative H
URD, for his leadership in introducing this commonsense legis-lation. The bill before us today in-cludes a number of different measures. The bill includes a measure origi-nally introduced by Senator M
CCAS-
KILL to deal with information tech-nology threats to the Federal acquisi-tion supply chain. The bill would ad-dress the serious cybersecurity risks that recently came to light after the discovery of Kaspersky products had been installed on many government computers. The bill would establish the Federal Acquisition Security Council to facili-tate information sharing among Fed-eral agencies regarding supply chain risks when purchasing information technology products and create proce-dures for evaluating such risks. The bill would give agencies the au-thority to mitigate supply chain IT risks and authorizes the Council to rec-ommend excluding suppliers, if war-ranted. The bill also would establish a judi-cial review process and reporting re-quirements to ensure fairness and ac-countability if companies are excluded in the future. In addition, the bill includes several provisions to improve cybersecurity at the Department of Homeland Security, one which was originally authored by Senator HASSAN of New Hampshire. It would create a pilot program through which the Department would be au-thorized to provide a financial reward to those who legitimately come for-ward to report vulnerabilities on DHS websites and software to prevent ex-ploitation by cyber terrorists, State actors, and criminal organizations. So-called white hat hackers are an enormous pool of talent that the Fed-eral Government has largely failed to leverage. The bill would also require DHS to put in place policies to ensure that civic-minded hackers can identify and report bugs found on the Depart-ment’s information systems without breaking the law. I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting the SECURE Technology Act, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HURD. Mr. Speaker, I make my friend, the gentlewoman from the Dis-trict of Columbia, whom I always take every opportunity to work with, aware that I have no further speakers, and I am prepared to close. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend especially for his work on this bill and for his friendship and for our continuing work together. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speak-ers, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. HURD. Mr. Speaker, this is an-other example of how we can actually get things done up here in Washington, D.C., if we work together. This is a piece of legislation that is going to help secure our networks, make sure we are protecting the American people, and I urge the adoption of this bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. H
URD) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 7327. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. MASSIE. Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not present. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-ceedings on this question will be post-poned. The point of no quorum is considered withdrawn.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H10301 December 19, 2018 
BERNICE JOHNSON , who is on the floor this evening, as well as 28 other com-mittee members from both parties. America is now in a race with China and Europe to develop the next techno-logical breakthroughs based on the power of quantum science. It is a race we must win for our economic and na-tional security. The National Quantum Initiative Act creates a 10-year Federal program to accelerate quantum research and de-velopment in the United States. The bill leverages the expertise and re-sources of U.S. industry, academia, and government to move quantum informa-tion science to the next level. Quantum information science uses quantum physics for the storage, transmission, manipulation, computing, and meas-urement of information. This legislation establishes a Na-tional Quantum Coordination Office within the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. This office will oversee interagency coordi-nation and strategic planning, serve as a central point of contact for stake-holders, conduct outreach, and pro-mote commercialization of Federal re-search by the private sector. The bill also supports basic research, education, and standards development at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the National Science Foundation, and the Department of En-ergy. Up to $255 million a year of these agencies’ funding will be directed to new quantum research centers and lab-oratory research. Their activities will address fundamental research gaps, create a stronger workforce, and gen-erate transformative innovations to give U.S. companies and workers a competitive advantage. The bill ensures that U.S. high-tech companies, which are investing heavily in quantum research, and a surge of quantum technology startups will con-tribute their knowledge and resources to a national effort. H.R. 6227 was developed with input from industry, academia, national lab-oratories, Federal agencies, and the ad-ministration. The result is a strong consensus bill, which I urge my col-leagues to support. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6227, the National Quantum Initiative Act, and I thank Chairman S
MITH and our colleagues in the Senate, Senators T
HUNE , NELSON , MURKOWSKI , and C ANT-
WELL , for their leadership on this bill. This is a good, bipartisan bill, and I am happy that we will be voting today to enact this bill into law before the Congress expires. H.R. 6227 is the prod-uct of extensive formal and informal engagement with key stakeholders in industry, academia, and the Federal Government. The Science, Space, and Technology Committee held a hearing late in 2017 in which we heard from Federal agen-cy, university, and industry represent-atives about ongoing research and fu-ture opportunities in quantum sensing, quantum communication, and quantum computing. We also heard about invest-ments in quantum research across our agencies and the need for a strategic and coordinated approach going for-ward. In addition to the hearing, com-mittee staff held numerous bipartisan meetings and roundtables to inform the development of this committee. Quantum sensors are already begin-ning to enter the marketplace, with po-tential applications across all sectors— from environmental sensing, to bio-medical imaging, to the military bat-tlefield. The race is on to lead the world on long-range quantum commu-nications, which, in theory, at least, would be unhackable. Quantum communications is the area of quantum technology development where the U.S. is most at risk in ceding its leadership. Our R&D investments pale in comparison to the scale of in-vestments being made in China and elsewhere. Many believe quantum computing technology has the potential to accel-erate progress on some of our most pressing challenges, including how to address climate change and understand complex diseases like cancer. It is truly an exciting time for this field and for the broad spectrum of innovators that are planning to take advantage of these breakthrough capa-bilities. It is also a time of increasing international competition, and the stakes are high. Global leadership in quantum com-puting brings with it a military and in-telligence edge, as well as a competi-tive advantage in what many expect to be a massive industry for decades to come. We must invest more in re-search. We must also ensure that we are educating and training the next generation of top quantum scientists and engineers. Our Nation’s progress in advancing research in quantum science and cap-italizing on these investments to de-velop real-world technologies will de-pend on partnerships among our Fed-eral agencies, universities, and the pri-vate sector. The National Quantum Ini-tiative Act will set us on the right path. H.R. 6227 directs the President to es-tablish a 10-year National Quantum Initiative Program, with the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the National Science Foundation, and the Department of Energy playing leading roles. Through the establish-ment of a national coordination office, an outside advisory committee, and an interagency working group, the pro-gram will take a whole-of-government approach to accelerating progress in quantum research and technology de-velopment and building a strong quan-tum science and engineering work-force. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may con-sume. Mr. Speaker, first, I thank Senator THUNE and Senator N ELSON , the chair-man and ranking member of the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transpor-tation Committee, who introduced a companion bill to H.R. 6227 in the Sen-ate. I also acknowledge Senator L
ISA M
URKOWSKI and Senator M ARIA CANT-
WELL , the chair and ranking member of the Senate Energy and Natural Re-sources Committee, for their work on this bill as well. Finally, the President’s White House Office of Science and Technology Pol-icy, as well as the leadership at NSF, NIST, and the Department of Energy have been steadfast in their support. This legislation will help the U.S. to become the world’s leader in quantum development. Let’s support this bill and send it to the President’s desk. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. b1645 Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I have no requests for time. I urge passage, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, with the Speaker’s allowance and per-mission, we have another speaker on his way to the House floor who we ex-pect to be here in another 30 seconds, so if I could talk slowly and go on for another 30 seconds, I think the gen-tleman from Texas (Mr. W
EBER ) will be here and would like to have the last word. Mr. Speaker, I have no other requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6227, the National Quantum Initiative Act, I wish to commend Chairman S
MITH on his six years at the helm of the Science Committee, and on his 32 years of dedicated service to the people of Texas’ 21st Congressional District. It has been an honor to work with him. Because of his steadfast leadership, this bill is on its way to becoming law. I thank Chairman S
MITH. This bill coordinates a federal program to accelerate quantum research and develop-ment for the economic and national security of the United States. Quantum technology is a field positioned to fundamentally change the way we move and process data. Theoretically, quantum computing could allow for the solutions to exponentially large problems—things that cannot be accomplished by even the fastest supercomputers today. It could allow us to visualize the structures of complex chemicals and materials, to model highly detailed flows of potential mass evacu-ations with precise accuracy, and to quantify subatomic interactions on the cutting edge of nuclear research. Quantum computing may also have pro-found implications for cybersecurity tech-nology. Should China and Russia beat us to achieving quantum encryption, our current se-curity encryption measures would be rendered obsolete. It is imperative that the U.S. main-tain its leadership in this field.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH10302 December 19, 2018 
In order to achieve this kind of revolutionary improvement in technology, we need foundational knowledge in the advanced com-puting and materials science required to con-struct quantum systems. The Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science is the leading federal sponsor of basic research in the physical sciences and funds robust quantum technology research. At Law-rence Berkeley National Lab, the National En-ergy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC) allows scientists to run simulations of quantum architectures. At Argonne National Lab’s Center for Nanoscale Materials, re-searchers study atomic-scale materials in order to engineer the characteristics of quan-tum information systems. And at Fermi Na-tional Accelerator Laboratory, scientists are applying their experience in high energy phys-ics to the study of quantum materials. Earlier this year, I invited several of my colleagues to join me on a visit to Argonne and Fermi labs, and we had the privilege of speaking with the scientists conducting this groundbreaking re-search. Support for basic research in computer science and for computational partnerships between industry, academia, and the national labs is necessary to develop the technology needed for future commercial quantum sys-tems. For these reasons, I encourage my col-leagues to join me in supporting H.R. 6227. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. S
MITH) that the House suspend the rules and concur in the Senate amendment to the bill, H.R. 6227. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not present. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-ceedings on this question will be post-poned. The point of no quorum is considered withdrawn.

REAUTHORIZE THE NEW JERSEY COASTAL HERITAGE TRAIL ROUTE Mr. M
CCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 6602) to reauthorize the New Jersey Coastal Heritage Trail Route, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 6602 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-resentatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. NEW JERSEY COASTAL HERITAGE TRAIL ROUTE. 
(a) R EAUTHORIZATION .—Section 6 of Public Law 100–515 (16 U.S.C. 1244 note) is amended— (1) by striking subsection (a); (2) by redesignating subsections (b) and (c) as subsections (a) and (b), respectively; (3) in subsection (a) (as so redesignated by paragraph (2)), by striking ‘‘under subsection (a)’’ each place that it appears and inserting ‘‘to carry out this Act’’; and (4) in subsection (b) (as so redesignated by paragraph (2)), by striking ‘‘2011’’ and insert-ing ‘‘2025’’.

GENERAL LEAVE  
Mr. M CCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Mem-bers may have 5 legislative days to re-vise and extend their remarks and in-clude extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. M
CCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may con-sume. The New Jersey Coastal Heritage Trail Route was authorized by Con-gress in 1988, and it runs along the en-tire eastern coast of New Jersey. The National Park Service, the State of New Jersey, the Pinelands Commis-sion, and other local organizations have partnered to promote recreation and appreciation of New Jersey’s coast-al areas along that route. The route links wildlife refuges, historic sites, and natural areas to tell the story of New Jersey’s role in shaping U.S. his-tory and in providing important habi-tat for birds and other wildlife. The coalition’s efforts to enhance public enjoyment and access bring more visi-tors to these special places from New Jersey and beyond. H.R. 6602 will reauthorize the Sec-retary of the Interior’s authority to co- manage the New Jersey Coastal Herit-age Trail Route through 2025 and to provide technical assistance. This au-thority expired in 2011. Congressman F
RANK LOBIONDO should be commended for his support for his constituents and for the Coastal Herit-age Trail, and I am pleased to move this legislation before his retirement from the House. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6602 would reau-thorize the New Jersey Coastal Herit-age Trail Route through 2025. H.R. 6602 would also instruct the Sec-retary of the Interior to draft a stra-tegic plan to enhance the trail route for the future, providing opportunities to sustain this very worthwhile pro-gram. I congratulate Representative LOBI-
ONDO for his hard work on this legisla-tion. I urge my colleagues to support the legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. M
CCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, Con-gressman L
OBIONDO is going to be re-tiring from this House after many, many years of distinguished service at the close of this session, and it has been my distinct honor and pleasure to serve with him. Mr. Speaker, it is my distinct honor and pleasure to yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. L
OBIONDO ). Mr. L
OBIONDO. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from California for the kind words and for his service to our country, and I say ditto about an honor to serve with him and everyone else in this body. I rise today to urge passage of H.R. 6602, to reauthorize the New Jersey Coastal Heritage Trail. This was some-thing that I worked on with the late Senator Frank Lautenberg a number of years ago. Since its inception in 1988, the Coast-al Heritage Trail has been a major suc-cess throughout my district, as well as the entire State. Now, although there are 12 Members of Congress from the State of New Jer-sey, the Second Congressional District, which I have had the honor of rep-resenting, is about 40 percent of the State geographically, so this trail spans nearly 300 miles, covering much of New Jersey’s coastline. It was de-signed to provide an educational and enjoyable understanding of the nat-ural, maritime, and cultural sites of our coast, which, I must admit, are many. The Coastal Heritage Trail is divided into five regions linked by the common heritage of life on the Jersey shore, as well as the Raritan and Delaware Bays. Finally, this trail has been a great example of the work that can be done through collaboration with public and private partnerships, and I think the success of the trail is really because of these collaborations and the different, various groups that have come to-gether to understand how working to-gether can really make a difference. Through partnership with the Na-tional Park Service, Congress, and local organizations, the Coastal Herit-age Trail has received support and has been beautifully maintained until au-thorization recently lapsed. With this lapse of authorization, the public sec-tor groups and the private sector

groups were not able to maintain the trail, which they had most of the re-source to take care of this. So it has been a big problem with the lapse. Mr. Speaker, it is time to redesignate this trail so it can be enjoyed by count-less residents and visitors to New Jer-sey for many years to come. I urge pas-sage of H.R. 6602. I thank my col-leagues for considering this, and I very much appreciate the opportunity to move this bill. Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote for this legislation. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. M
CCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I join Mr. G
RIJALVA in asking for the support of this Chamber of this meas-ure. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. M

STIGLER ACT AMENDMENTS OF 2018 Mr. M
CCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and concur in the Senate amendments to the bill (H.R. 2606) to amend the Act of August 4, 1947 (commonly known as the Stigler Act), with respect to restrictions appli-cable to Indians of the Five Civilized Tribes of Oklahoma, and for other pur-poses. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the Senate amendments is as follows: Senate amendments: Ω1æOn page 3, line 12, strike ø, as of said date,¿ and insert: , as of the date of enactment of the Stigler Act Amendments of 2018, Ω2æAt the end of the bill, add the following: 
SEC. 5. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION PROVIDING FOR NO RETROACTIVITY. 
Nothing in this Act, or the amendments made by this Act, shall be construed to revise or ex-tend the restricted status of any lands under the Act of August 4, 1947 (61 Stat. 731, chapter 458) that lost restricted status under such Act before the date of enactment of this Act. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-ant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. M
CCLINTOCK ) and the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. G
RI-

GENERAL LEAVE  
Mr. M CCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Mem-bers may have 5 legislative days to re-vise and extend their remarks and in-clude extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. M
CCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may con-sume. I rise today in support of the Senate amendments to H.R. 2606. This bill would amend the 1947 Stigler Act to re-move the Indian blood quantum re-quirement for certain land to be main-tained in restricted fee status for any member of the Five Civilized Tribes of Oklahoma. Under H.R. 2606, restricted fee land currently owned by members of the Five Tribes would remain in restricted status regardless of the blood quantum of the owners. H.R. 2606 passed the House on Sep-tember 12, 2018, by voice vote. A clari-fying amendment was adopted before being passed by the Senate on Decem-ber 13, 2018. I thank the sponsor of the legisla-tion, the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. C
OLE), for his work on this bill. I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2606 seeks to amend the 1947 Stigler Act by remov-ing the arbitrary blood quantum levels it established for Indian land owner-ship. This will ensure that lands cur-rently owned by the citizens of the Five Tribes of Oklahoma will remain in restricted fee status, regardless of their blood quantum levels or that of their heirs. The House has already passed this measure once, and I am happy to agree to the changes that the Senate made to Mr. C
OLE’s bill. Upholding the sanctity of a Tribe’s land base should be of utmost impor-tance to Congress and the Federal Gov-ernment as a whole. A tribal land base is not just about tax-exempt status or economic development, both of which are vitally important to tribal commu-nities. It is also about construction of housing, schools, clinics, and eldercare facilities, things that are extremely vital to the health and the well-being of tribal members. It is also about recognizing a tribe’s historical, cultural, and spiritual con-nection to the land, land that they called their own until it was forcibly or wrongly taken from them. We need to ensure that tribal sov-ereignty and self-governance are more than just talking points. There are real-world decisions that we make that have very real consequences, so it is shameful that a dark chapter in his-tory is now repeating itself. I am refer-ring to the dire situation that is facing the Mashpee Tribe of Massachusetts. The Mashpee have inhabited present- day Massachusetts and eastern Rhode Island for more than 12,000 years. Their ancestors are the ones who welcomed the Pilgrims who landed at Plymouth Rock, as well as the people who aided these Pilgrims through the hard times of 1621 that we now refer to as our First Thanksgiving. Like many tribes, the Mashpee were intentionally and systematically ren-dered landless through various actions by the States and the Federal Govern-ment. b1700 They have fought long and hard since that time to reestablish that which was taken from them: their homeland. They fought first for Federal recogni-tion, which they finally received in 2009 after a 30-year struggle. They then fought to establish a homeland for their people, which they finally did in 2015, when Interior approved their ap-plication to take 320 acres into trust for the Tribe. Things were looking optimistic for the Mashpee people. They constructed a government center, which includes a school, courtrooms, and multipurpose rooms, and they established a medical clinic facility. They were planning to embark on economic development op-portunities that would help sustain the Tribal people and ensure their pros-perity for future generations. Then the rug was cruelly pulled out from be-neath them. In 2017, the Department of Justice, under the Trump administration, inexplicably refused to continue to de-fend the status of the Tribe’s reserva-tion in court. Then on September 7, 2018, the De-partment of the Interior issued its first Carciary decision, in which it refused to reaffirm its own authority to con-firm the status of the Tribe’s reserva-tion. Interior rejected clear evidence that the Mashpee were indeed under Federal jurisdiction, evidence that was accepted as sufficient in prior agency decisions. This decision is devastating and un-precedented. It would mark the first time since the dark days of the termi-nation era that the United States acts to de-establish an Indian reservation and make a Tribe landless.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH10304 December 19, 2018 
On our side of the aisle, we have been sounding the alarm for some time that this would come to pass if we did not address the Carciary issue, and yet the majority has refused to address that issue for almost a decade. Many other Tribes also face frivolous lawsuits on land that they have had in trust for years, sometimes decades. These attacks on sovereignty eat up valuable Tribal resources and funds, funds that could be instead used on housing, healthcare, economic develop-ment, and a myriad of other Tribal needs and concerns. As a result of this, the Trump admin-istration’s decision, the Mashpee and the Tribal government is on the brink of total dissolve. The legal limbo that has been imposed by the decision is forcing the Tribe to have to borrow thousands of dollars every day to keep its government running. This has re-sulted in devastating cuts to essential services and massive layoffs. The majority of Tribal members are employed with the Tribe. Due to this, the Tribal unemployment rate has sky-rocketed to 49 percent. They have had to essentially dissolve their police force except for one patrol officer; they have laid off all Tribal court staff; they are in the process of shutting down their elder services and addiction treatment programs; and they are hav-ing to shut down their language im-mersion school serving preschool and school-age children. This is completely unacceptable and, sadly, avoidable. If this were occurring with a State or a local government, my colleagues across the aisle would have already remedied the situation, and we could do just that. We could address this issue head-on by simply reaffirming the trust status of Mashpee land. We could overturn the misguided agency decision and give stability and sov-ereignty back to the Mashpee people. This is exactly what many of us on both sides of the aisle have strongly advocated for months; however, the si-lence from Republican leadership of the House is deafening. Legislation to affirm the Mashpee homeland has ex-isted for months, even before the Inte-rior decision, yet the majority has re-fused to move it. Inaction is complacency, and the in-action of this body sets a dangerous precedent moving forward for other Tribes that are having their sov-ereignty challenged. Many of us have worked diligently over the years to right the wrongs of the past and rightfully return land back to Tribes. Mr. Speaker, I implore our Republican majority to work with us now to ensure Mashpee culture and its way of life survives. Congress must affirm its Federal trust responsibility and ensure Tribal sovereignty remains intact. We must not idly stand by as Tribal people are on the losing end of another heinous wrongdoing—not on this watch. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. M CCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate the gentleman from Arizona on an inspiring and elo-quent speech on a subject that has nothing to do with the bill at hand. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. C
OLE), the author of this measure. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman for yielding, and I certainly want to thank him and Chairman B
ISHOP for their assistance through this whole process. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2606, the Stigler Act Amendments of 2018, and on the Senate amendments to that legislation. I also speak on behalf of the citizens of the Cherokee Nation, the Chickasaw Nation, the Choctaw Nation of Okla-homa, the Muscogee (Creek) Nation, and the Seminole Nation of Oklahoma, commonly known as the Five Civilized Tribes. This bill only addresses and af-fects those Tribes and lands of their citizens within the State of Oklahoma. The passage of this legislation is crit-ical to maintaining the inherited land of our Native citizens’ ancestors. This legislation seeks to amend the original Stigler Act of 1947 and remove the one-half degree requirement of Na-tive American blood. The original Stigler Act provides that, upon probate, if the heirs or devi-sees of an original allottee from the Five Tribes have passed out of one-half degree of Native blood, the allotment loses its restricted fee status. This bill ends that practice. It pro-vides the opportunity for the heirs and devisees to take title to the land and allow the parcel to maintain its re-stricted status. This legislation will also create par-ity in Federal law in the treatment of Native American-allotted land by re-moving minimum blood degree require-ments. Currently, these minimum re-quirements apply only to the citizens of the Five Tribes. The House has already passed this legislation this Congress by voice vote, and it was passed in the Senate with an amendment by unanimous consent. The Senate amendment provides clari-fying technical language, which I fully support. Mr. Speaker, I encourage my col-leagues to once again support and pass H.R. 2606 to remove this outdated and discriminatory law and to preserve what Native-held land is left in Okla-homa’s Indian Country. Mr. Speaker, I want to again thank the chairman for his help in this mat-ter. It partially rights an historic wrong. Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. M
CGOVERN ). Mr. M
CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. G
RIJALVA ), my good friend, for yielding time and for his leadership on this and so many other important issues. Mr. Speaker, I have no concerns with the underlying bill before us today, and I thank the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. COLE), whom I have the great honor to serve with on the House Rules Committee, for his efforts on this bill. However, I am very concerned—and I can’t stress that enough, very con-cerned and disappointed—that this ma-jority has refused to allow an impor-tant bipartisan bill affecting a Tribe in my home State of Massachusetts from coming to the floor today. Mr. Speaker, I want to express my appreciation for all the hard work my fellow Massachusetts delegation mem-bers J
OEKENNEDY and B ILLKEATING  have done to advance that bill. The Federal Government formally recognized the Mashpee Wampanoag in 2010. In 2015, the previous administra-tion agreed to hold several hundred acres of land in trust. Yet, despite these actions, the status of the Native American Tribe that greeted the Pil-grims landing on Plymouth Rock near-ly 400 years ago is in question. In September, the Department of the Interior unjustly reversed its prior de-cision to hold the Mashpee land in trust. The review of the Department’s prior decision came due to a quirk in a 1934 Federal law, but that minor quirk could have major implications for this Tribal community. Schools could be shuttered, healthcare access could be restricted, and its economic sov-ereignty could be limited. H.R. 5244, the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe Reservation Reaffirmation Act, was introduced by my good friend B
ILL K
EATING . This bill would reaffirm the Mashpee land as being held in trust in Massachusetts, effectively overturning this unjust decision by the Department of the Interior. Mr. Speaker, Congress has acted time and again to correct unjust actions taken by our government with respect to Native American Tribes across the country. We must do so again to pro-tect the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe, and I urge my colleagues to bring this legislation that will do just that to the House floor for a vote as soon as pos-sible. Now, if that doesn’t happen in the re-maining hours of this Congress, I will look forward to working with the dis-tinguished incoming chair of the Nat-ural Resources Committee to make this bill a reality. This is the right thing to do, and, quite frankly, it is just inexcusable that this House hasn’t moved this issue forward. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding the time. Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. M
CCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I have no doubt the issues raised by the gentleman will be addressed in the fu-ture. In the meantime, this bill ad-dresses an important matter to the Five Civilized Tribes of Oklahoma, and I would ask for its adoption. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

GENERAL LEAVE  
Mr. M CCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Mem-bers may have 5 legislative days to re-vise and extend their remarks and in-clude extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. M
CCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may con-sume. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6652, authored by my colleague from Washington (Mr. N
EWHOUSE ), authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to transfer the ownership of certain water infrastructure re-sources from the Bureau of Reclama-tion to the Kennewick Irrigation Dis-trict, which already operates and main-tains the facilities. Now, to be clear, this is not a give-away of taxpayer-owned property. The district has a long-term contract with Reclamation to repay the capital costs of construction, with the payment to be completed by the time of the trans-fer. This legislation is about supporting local water infrastructure. The trans-fer will allow the district to more effi-ciently manage water supplies, while giving the local community the ability to seek private financing, through eq-uity, to improve vital water infrastruc-ture. This is also a win for the American taxpayer. Title transfers like this re-duce regulatory paperwork and staff time for both parties, reduce the Fed-eral backlog for repairs and upgrades to improve the environment and public safety, and reduce Federal liability. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may con-sume. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6652, as stated, au-thorizes the conveyance of certain water facilities owned by the Bureau of Reclamation to the Kennewick Irriga-tion District in Washington. Before transferring the water facili-ties and associated lands, the legisla-tion wisely requires an assessment be completed under the National Environ-mental Policy Act. The bill also requires the Department of the Interior affirm that the transfer won’t have a negative effect on the en-vironment or harm Tribal trust re-sources before the transfer can take place. Mr. Speaker, these are important safeguards. I applaud Congressman N
EWHOUSE for agreeing to them. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. N
EWHOUSE ), the author of this measure and a leader on the Natural Resources Committee. b1715 Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the good gentleman from Cali-fornia for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of my legislation, H.R. 6652, to transfer Bureau of Reclamation works to the Kennewick Irrigation District. As many of my colleagues know far too well, communities across the West-ern United States too often are faced with the detrimental impacts of droughts and water shortages. Water providers across central Washington and across the West face numerous challenges to supply water, including growing demand, aging infrastructure, and changing precipitation patterns. By transferring the Bureau of Rec-lamation works to a local entity, like the Kennewick Irrigation District, water suppliers can better manage crit-ical water resources and empower water managers to be as responsive, ef-ficient, and innovative as possible in serving their community. In addition to transferring the works, the legislation before us will provide for reduced Federal liabilities and, with the Kennewick Irrigation District prepaying for the works, there is an ad-ditional cost-savings benefit to the Federal Government. I thank the chairman of the Natural Resources Committee in the House, Chairman B
ISHOP , for moving this leg-islation forward, which truly is a win- win for local water providers, the Fed-eral Government, and taxpayers. Mr. Speaker, I also thank Mr. Bill Ball, the staff director of the Subcommittee on Water, Power, and Oceans, for his tre-mendous work at the committee; and a personal shout-out to one of my office staff members, Travis Martinez, for his work. Mr. Speaker, I encourage my col-leagues to support this legislation on final passage, and I look forward to the Senate moving swiftly to get this legis-lation to the President’s desk. Mr. M
CCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. M
CCLINTOCK ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6652, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. M

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-ant to the rule, the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. G
RAVES ) and the gen-tleman from Arizona (Mr. G
RIJALVA ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Louisiana. 
GENERAL LEAVE  
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their re-marks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Louisiana? There was no objection. Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, back in April of last year, in April of 2017, we introduced legislation known as the Modern Fish Act, the Modernizing Recreational Fisheries Management Act. A few months later, in July, on July 10, the Senate introduced a companion meas-ure. Mr. Speaker, the House bill has 24 bi-partisan cosponsors and, on July 11, the House passed this bill, the House version, H.R. 2023, as part of H.R. 200, the overall Magnuson-Stevens Fish-eries Conservation Act Reauthoriza-tion. Mr. Speaker, Magnuson-Stevens was first authorized in 1976, very important legislation that largely at the time was designed to manage commercial fishing out in Federal waters across the United States. Over time, we have seen extraor-dinary changes in fishing, both in com-mercial fishing, in technology and de-mand on species, changes in technology and science and our ability to better manage these species; and, impor-tantly, Mr. Speaker, changes in the de-mand from recreational fishers. People like you and I, myself and our kids, we enjoy going out and fishing. Magnuson-Stevens was designed largely to manage the commercial side, and it largely lacked the important balance or consideration of the mil-lions and millions of fishers, of anglers, that go out and enjoy it just as fami-lies, and this bill helps to fix that. The Modern Fish Act will recognize in Federal law for the first time that recreational fishing and commercial fishing are fundamentally different ac-tivities and, therefore, should be man-aged differently to fit the characteris-tics of each sector. Mr. Speaker, while recreational fish-ing is an experience-based activity, commercial fishing is designed for prof-it. It is a for-profit activity, it is a business activity. We have seen significant evolution in the way that the States manage State waters, recreational and commercial fishing in State waters. And let’s keep in mind, there is nothing that distin-guishes State waters and Federal waters. When you get outside the sea-ward boundaries of States, generally 3 miles in most States, it is indistin-guishable. The species go back and forth, but the management styles have fundamentally changed. In my home State of Louisiana, our recreational fishers have determined that they are going to impose a fee on themselves to improve the collection of data to improve the science to better inform our fishery management deci-sions. The Federal Government has the opportunity to do the same thing and, in some cases, to better involve States to ensure the complementary nature of fisheries management in the Gulf of Mexico, the Atlantic, the Pacific, Alas-ka, and in other areas. This bill will allow the Regional Fishery Management Councils to man-age recreational fisheries more suc-cessfully based on public access, with-out hard quotas, or TACs. Ultimately, these changes will help to avoid sudden closures and drastically changing fish-ing regulations that have been plagu-ing many Federally managed fisheries. The State of Louisiana is one of the most productive ecosystems in the North American Continent. We have nearly 90 percent of the freshwater in-puts in the Gulf of Mexico coming through our State. We have one of the top commercial fishing industries in the Nation—in fact, the largest in the continental United States—and we produce more shrimp, blue crabs, oys-ters, crayfish, and other species than anywhere else in this Nation. It is important to also keep in mind that we are one of the top recreational fishing destinations. We are a place where many people like to come to fish: redfish, speckled trout, red snap-per, Amberjack, cobia, and many, many other species. We have got to have that balance. This bill moves in the right direction to ensure that we do have a balance. Lastly, Mr. Speaker, let me just say this. The regulations, the laws, that manage our roads, we have a very dif-ferent structure on how 18 wheelers, how trucks are managed, versus cars; we have different rules on how civilians versus military engage; we also have a different tax code for businesses and in-dividuals. This bill simply does the same thing: it recognizes that there is a difference between commercial fish-ing and recreational fishing. Especially in our home, in the Gulf of Mexico, it recognizes that there is ex-traordinary participation on the rec-reational side of fishers, of just the general public, going out there and en-joying that experiential activity to go out there and go catch fish in the Gulf of Mexico. We must ensure that we have better science, that we have bet-ter decisions in the Gulf of Mexico, and that we have better balance on how these fisheries are managed. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, S. 1520, known as the Modern Fish Act, expands opportuni-ties for recreational fishermen by en-couraging the use of multiple fisheries management tools. Importantly, S. 1520 keeps the core conservation provi-sions of the Magnuson-Stevens Act in-tact by making it clear that fisheries managers can use multiple tools, but annual catch limits cannot be exceed-ed.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H10309 December 19, 2018 
This bill encourages managers to think about how to manage fisheries in a way that benefits both conservation and fishing access. I applaud Senator W
ICKER and Sen-ator N
ELSON for the hard work they have undertaken to get this bill across the finish line. This bill is a major im-provement from the version that was introduced in the House earlier this year, and I commend my colleagues in the Senate for getting it to a place where all of us can support it. This year, we have seen progress on recreational fisheries issues, driven by advancements in technologies and data collection systems. While the rec-reational fishing industry is vital to the economy of the United States, the last thing we want is another tragedy of the commons or policies that under-cut that progress. The changes made to S. 1520 meet the demands of the recreational fishing in-dustry while also ensuring access to sustainable fisheries. I am thankful for the good faith ef-fort shown on both sides of the aisle and for a bipartisan bill that does not compromise the sustainability of our Nation’s fisheries. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I reiterate that this is bipartisan legislation. I thank my friend from Arizona for the cooperation in ensuring that we get text that ev-eryone agrees is a step in the right di-rection in improving that balance in the management of commercial and recreational fisheries, in ensuring that we have the best science informing our decisions and that our resource man-agers have access to that information and are allowed to use it. I thank the 24 bipartisan cosponsors from States like Georgia, South Carolina, Florida, Texas, and many other coastal States in the United States that worked with us on this to ensure that we move in the right direction. And I thank the dean of the House and the king in the North, Congressman D
ONYOUNG , for all of the work that he has done for dec-ades in progressing Federal fisheries management policy. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Bill Ball, Dustin Davidson, and the many staff who helped to work on this legis-lation, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. G
RAVES ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 1520. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not present. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-ceedings on this question will be post-poned. The point of no quorum is considered withdrawn. f

GENERAL LEAVE  
Mr. BANKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Mem-bers may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their re-marks and include extraneous material on S. 3530. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Indiana? There was no objection. Mr. BANKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may con-sume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 3530, the Museum and Library Services Act of 2018. b1730 The Institute of Museum and Library Services was first established through the Museum and Library Services Act of 1996 to coordinate our Federal mu-seum and library programs. The majority of the funding that the IMLS receives supports the Library Grants to States Program. This spe-cific program provides population- based formula grants to improve li-brary services according to each State’s 5-year plan. It also provides funding for library and museum serv-ices and professional development for library and museum professionals and aspiring professionals through com-petitive grants. The Museum and Library Services Act of 2018 reauthorizes the IMLS and the programs under the law through fiscal year 2025 and authorizes level funding for 6 years equal to the amounts in current law. The legislation also provides key re-forms to the IMLS and its programs. S. 3530 updates provisions of the law to re-flect the evolving role of libraries and museums in our society. It recognizes libraries as community hubs equipped to serve community needs, and the leg-islation highlights the unique edu-cational role that museums play. The bill increases the set-asides for services for Native Americans and codifies a museum professional devel-opment program in a way that mirrors the Laura Bush 21st Century Librarian Program. Lastly, the legislation puts an em-phasis on the needs of rural commu-nities and funds activities that will serve geographically diverse areas. This is commonsense reauthorization legislation that affirms the important role that libraries and museums play in our communities. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, again, S. 3530 renews the Museum and Library Services Act to enhance the ability of libraries and museums to address community needs, including workforce development, lit-eracy, and accessibility for individuals with disabilities. The bill is supported by the Amer-ican Library Association and the American Alliance of Museums. This legislation strengthens the use of data- driven tools to maximize the effective-ness of services; provides technical sup-port and assistance to help the librar-ies and museums with data collection responsibilities; authorizes the 21st Century Museum Professionals Pro-gram to recruit museum professionals from diverse and underrepresented backgrounds; enhances collaborative efforts with Federal agencies to fully meet the needs of Americans; and in-creases services for Native Americans.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H10313 December 19, 2018 
It is vital to ensure that our libraries and museums have the necessary re-sources to modernize their services and continue to solidify their role as tech-nological hubs of our communities and as access points in our communities throughout this country. Libraries and museums ensure access to information for millions of adults and children across this country, and I am thrilled that we have the oppor-tunity to promote their growth, expand their services, and safeguard these crit-ical institutions for generations to come. I am proud to have introduced this legislation with Congressman H
URD from Texas who introduced the com-panion legislation in the House and fully support the passage of S. 3530, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BANKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from North Caro-lina (Ms. F
OXX). Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I thank ev-eryone who has worked hard on this legislation. S. 3530, the Museum and Library Services Act of 2018, is an excellent op-portunity to honor the place of librar-ies in our diverse communities. As a girl growing up in the moun-tains of North Carolina, libraries were vital to my own education, and that was the case for everyone in my com-munity. Almost 19 years into the 21st century, libraries continue to provide lifelines to lifelong learners all across this great country. They are as vital as ever. We in the House are happy to do our part in ensuring these local institu-tions continue to play the important role they do in educating Americans of every age and communities of every size. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Indiana for his role in this. Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BANKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, this bill is common-sense reauthorization legislation. I urge my colleagues to support S. 3530 and affirm the important role that li-braries and museums play in our com-munities. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore.

ANKS ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 3530. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Pursu-ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-ceedings on this question will be post-poned. The point of no quorum is considered withdrawn. f

FAREWELL TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES (Mr. CROWLEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, this evening I say goodbye to the House of Representatives after 20 years of serv-ice. Thank you to the people of Queens and the Bronx. It has been the honor of a lifetime to be the voice of many peo-ple from New York City. Mr. Speaker, as a son and grandson of immigrants from Ireland, more spe-cifically, as a son of a New York City cop, as a husband and a father, I can only hope I have made my family proud. My family is everything to me. They taught me to pursue fairness and justice, to use my power—and my size and my voice—for good, and to give back. I hope I have done that. I hope my colleagues will keep working to-gether to do the same. We all have different backgrounds, but we are all united by our shared dreams for this great land. I believe in the best of America, its people, and its public servants. Again, thank you to my family for the love and support you have always shown to me: to my mom, who was not able to be here tonight; to my brother, Sean; my sisters, Eileen and Maura; my brother’s wife, Maureen, and their boys; my sister’s children and their families; my children, Cullen, Kenzie, and Liam. I won’t tell you their ages, because they can’t be on the floor. And, of course, my wife, Kasey, is with us as well. Thank you, Kasey. To my staff, the greatest staff a per-son could ever have, all of you have made this such a great journey. From the darkest days of my life of 9/11 to the passage of the Affordable Care Act, a very special moment for me, it has been great to be a part of this amazing ride. I thank you all very much, and God bless you all. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to say goodbye to the House of Representatives. To say goodbye after 20 years of service to the people of New York and to the country. To say goodbye to what’s been the honor of a lifetime. I have been grateful every day for this op-portunity—to come to work in this chamber, to walk beneath the Capitol dome, to stand in the footsteps of the giants who came before us. And I will forever be thankful for having had the chance to represent my hometown com-munity.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H10321 December 19, 2018 
All four of my grandparents, and my mother, were immigrants from Ireland. They left behind everything they knew, in search of a better life for not just themselves, but for their future generations. I doubt they ever pictured that someday their grandson would serve in the United States Congress, but I hope I have done them proud. My dad was the oldest of seven, who first became a New York City cop, then went to college and law school on the GI bill. My mom didn’t go to college, but she worked as a legal secretary, raised four chil-dren, and gave us every opportunity she could. My family instilled in me the values that I hold dear to this day—the importance of hard work, building strong communities, and ensur-ing opportunity for all. They taught me to stand up for the little guy, to pursue fairness and justice, to use my power—and my size, and my voice—for good. And I’ve tried to incorporate those lessons throughout my work. My family also taught me the importance of service—of giving back. Of being part of something that’s bigger than yourself. That’s what I’ve been thinking about as I say farewell to my time in Congress. Our time here isn’t about any one of us—it’s about what’s best for the country. I think sometimes we lose sight of that in the day-to-day—the legislative deadlines, the political positioning. Our jobs here tend to be partisan—there’s no escaping that. But we can’t—we shouldn’t—let that blind us to what we’re sent here to do. Yes, I’ll remember the day we passed the Affordable Care Act to bring health care to mil-lions more Americans. I’ll remember marching for fair, humane im-migration reform with L
UISGUTIE´RREZ . I’ll re- member ‘‘sitting in’’ for sensible gun violence prevention. But I’ll also always remember walking across the Edmund Pettus Bridge with J
OHN L
EWIS, and watching my 13-year-old son hug J
OHN after the Chief of the Montgomery Police Department apologized for his treatment there so many years ago. I’ll remember welcoming Pope Francis, alongside N
ANCY PELOSI , John Boehner and the whole congressional leadership, many of whom I’m proud to call friends. I’ll remember fighting for sustainable peace in Ireland, for progress in Burma, for a strong-er relationship with India all of which require cooperation on both sides of the aisle. I’ll remember returning to the Capitol after the September 11 attacks, after the worst day of my life when my cousin John was declared among the lost firefighters, and the way I was welcomed, and embraced, and loved by mem-bers of every political persuasion. I think about those experiences when I’m wondering how we can get back to the days of working together, and seeing each other as people, not political opponents. But I believe we can find our way again. Because I do believe that government can do great things. I believe that we can create good-paying jobs, and a vibrant and strong economy that works for all. I believe that we can lead the world in inno-vation, and lead the world, period. But those aren’t Republican or Democratic goals. In my neighborhood, they’re shared by the shopkeeper, the taxi driver, the firefighter. And here, they’re shared by every one of us who walks into this chamber. We all have our own backgrounds and our own family folklore, but we’re united by our shared dreams for this country. So I always believe in the best in this coun-try, its people, and its public servants. Part of what helps me to keep that optimism is the love and support I’ve always gotten from my family, many of whom are here today. My mom, my brother and sisters, and their families. My children, Cullen, Kenzie, and Liam. And of course my wife Kasey, whose sup-port has allowed me to participate in this great arena. It’s been quite a ride. And while I’m sad to be leaving, I follow that old Irish tradition of keeping your chin up, keep smiling. I think you all know that I’m a little bit of a Bruce Springsteen fan. One of my favorite songs, Rosalita, has a line I can’t help but think about: ‘‘Someday we’ll look back on this and it will all seem funny.’’ I will seem funny. But it will also seem meaningful, it will seem compelling, it will seem historic. And it will always stand out to me as the greatest professional experience of my life. So thank you to my constituents, my friends, my family, my staff, and all of you who made this such a great journey. f 
BUDGET PROCESS, FISCAL YEAR 2019 (Mr. WOMACK asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. WOMACK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to encourage all of us to stay committed to reforming the Federal budget and appropriations process. Here we are, operating under a con-tinuing resolution and scrambling to adopt another, our third of fiscal year 2019 alone. Despite good work being done to fund 5 of the 12 annual appro-priations bills, after 2
1⁄2months and two continuing resolutions, our work remains unfinished. Mr. Speaker, the power of the purse is the most important constitutional responsibility granted to Congress, yet we have regularly and repeatedly ceded our duty to fulfill this essential role. It is unacceptable, and it is clear that the Federal budget and appropriations process is broken. The American people deserve better. As you know, the Joint Select Com-mittee on Budget and Appropriations Process Reform laid the groundwork for bipartisan, bicameral reform this past year. Our proposal began taking steps in the right direction to improve the process. While our efforts were un-successful, where we stand today high-lights just how desperately our work was needed. It, Mr. Speaker, is now more necessary than ever. I will continue to champion budget process reform and the ideas put forth by the joint select committee next year. Today, I sent a Dear Colleague letter outlining our year of work, which I include in the R
ECORD . I encourage all Members to review it and join me in this essential effort. We owe the American people this process. Let’s fix this. DEARCOLLEAGUE : In the Second Session of the 115th Congress, I was honored to Co- Chair the Joint Select Committee on Budget and Appropriations Process Reform. As members of the U.S. House of Representa-tives, Article I entrusts in each of us the power of the purse. This is an awesome re-sponsibility that I, and I know each of you, take very seriously. We owe it to the Amer-ican people to have a process that works, and that was the goal of the Joint Select Com-mittee—to produce recommendations to re-form the federal budget and appropriations process. As you know, our Joint Select Committee produced a bipartisan, bicameral consensus package of reforms in advance of our statu-tory deadline of November 30, 2018. During our markup, amendments were subjected to a supermajority threshold to ensure those that passed reflected a true consensus of the panel. Some amendments passed unani-mously. During the final debate on the bill, many members indicated that they had no objection to the package’s underlying re-forms. However, the bill and report devel-oped over many months of hard work failed to secure the necessary supermajority of votes to pass under our Joint Select Com-mittee’s rules. Despite the unfortunate outcome of the Joint Select Committee’s work, there is no refuting that the federal budget process is broken. It is vital that Congress continues these efforts to reform the budget and appro-priations process this year, next year, and in the years beyond. I have assembled in this Budget Committee print all the relevant ma-terials to this year’s work. I urge all Mem-bers to review this information. In this Com-mittee print, you will find: The report of the Joint Select Committee on Budget and Appropriations Process Re-form; The Co-chair’s mark, as amended, and voted on, by the Joint Select Committee; The votes of the Joint Select Committee; Hearing transcripts of the Joint Select Committee’s five public hearings; Congres-sional Budget Office briefing materials pre-pared for the Joint Select Committee; Congressional Research Service briefing materials prepared for the Joint Select Com-mittee; H.R. 7191—a bill introduced in the House by myself and Representative Yarmuth, a Joint Select Committee Member and Ranking Member of the House Budget Committee; and The press release to accompany the intro-duction of H.R. 7191. It is my sincere hope that this important work will continue in the 116th Congress on a bipartisan and bicameral basis. I believe Members of Congress, Executive Branch offi-cials, outside budget experts and academics, as well as engaged citizens, will find this ma-terial useful for future reform efforts. I would like to thank the Members of the Joint Select Committee on Budget and Ap-propriations Process Reform, our hard-working staffs, particularly Dan Keniry, David Reich, and Mary Popadiuk, as well as the House Rules Committee staff, Bob Weinhagen and Tom Cassidy in the Office of Legislative Counsel, budget experts at the Congressional Research Service and the Con-gressional Budget Office—particularly Mark Hadley and Teri Gullo—and House Parlia-mentarian Tom Wickham and his office, for the year of dedication. If you have any questions or would like ad-ditional information, please contact Dan Keniry, Staff Director of the House Budget

IN MEMORY OF SERVICEMEMBERS WHO PERISHED DURING THE U.S. MARINE CORPS TRAINING EXER-CISE ON DECEMBER 5, 2018 (Mr. HASTINGS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, it is with profound sadness that I rise today with my colleagues who have helped organize this, particularly my col-league Congressman R
UTHERFORD , to pay tribute to the servicemembers who tragically perished on December 5 dur-ing a training exercise off the coast of Japan: Lieutenant Colonel Kevin Herrmann of New Bern, North Carolina; Major James M. Brophy of Staatsburg, New York; Captain Jahmar Resilard of Miramar, Florida, who was raised in my district and whose mother I have spoken with; Staff Sergeant Maximo Flores of Sur-prise, Arizona; Corporal Daniel Baker of Tremont, Illinois; and, Corporal William Ross of Henderson-ville, Tennessee. These decorated marines served our Nation with distinction. Listing their achievements does little to pay ade-quate tribute to their bravery, courage, and dedication to our country. On behalf of my colleagues, I express our heartfelt condolences to the fami-lies of these honorable servicemem-bers, their friends, and their colleagues in the United States Marine Corps. Our Nation grieves with you, and we pray that you find comfort during these ex-tremely difficult times. Mr. Speaker, I request that the House of Representatives observe a mo-ment of silence in memory of these American heroes.

POWER OF THE PURSE (Mr. CULBERSON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Speaker, the Founders entrusted the power of the purse to the Congress because it is the most effective and powerful check and balance in our Constitution. It is vi-tally important that this Congress work to pass these appropriations bills in their full detail. We cannot continue to operate under a continuing resolu-tion, which just allows the executive branch to run unchecked. These bills have been carefully nego-tiated. These bills allow the public to see how our hard-earned tax dollars are being spent. These bills enable the Con-gress to have some real authority over the executive branch. In the 18 years it has been my privi-lege to represent the people of west Houston, and to chair a subcommittee on appropriations, I was able to work together with my colleagues in putting together the largest hurricane recovery package in the history of the country, working together to make sure that our laws are enforced and that the De-partment of Justice is following the law, enforcing the law, and securing the border. These things can be done through the power of the purse, through the respon-sibility we have as Members of Con-gress, as appropriators. It is essential we pass these appropriations bills and do so in a bipartisan way. I have always worked closely with my colleagues throughout the State of Texas and throughout the country, re-gardless of party, because we are doing it for the good of the country. As Mr. CROWLEY said in his remarks and you can detect by the response in the House, we all work together arm-in- arm as patriots. Let’s pass these appro-priations bills in detail when we come back here in the next year when the CR runs out in February.

HONORING PROFESSOR YUMIKO OGAWA (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor New Jersey City Uni-versity Professor Yumiko Ogawa. Professor Ogawa is a registered play therapist. Along with current and former NJCU students, she is providing play therapy for immigrant children who are in the process of applying for asylum. Their play therapy program is currently being implemented at the Newark office of a nonprofit called Kids in Need of Defense. Since 2014, the United States has wel-comed more than 240,000 unaccom-panied minors who are seeking protec-tion. Many of them have suffered from violence and child abuse. Some of them are escaping persistent trauma, includ-ing human trafficking and gang vio-lence. Professor Ogawa’s play therapy has already helped some of these children cope with their trauma. I am proud of Professor Ogawa’s thoughtful leader-ship and the amazing research sup-ported at New Jersey City University. It only takes an idea to change the world. I am proud to represent NJCU in Congress, and I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring this wonderful ini-tiative. f 
b2015 FAREWELL TO WILSON TEAM FELLOWS (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to ad-dress the House for 1 minute and to re-vise and extend his remarks.) Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for the dedi-cated staff work of Major Jonathan Grabill, who served as a military fel-low, and Drew Nickels, who served as a foreign policy fellow, in the office of the Second District. Major Grabill has had a distinguished career in the Army for more than 16 years. He provided key insight in devel-oping the National Defense Authoriza-tion Act. He has been deployed to Ger-many, Iraq, and Kuwait. His back-ground has been vital to reverse the de-cline of readiness in our military. A leader on foreign policy issues, Mr. Nickels has worked tirelessly to de-velop legislation for the Foreign Af-fairs Committee. He previously served as intelligence briefer for two Secre-taries of Energy. Before that, he was an intelligence analyst with the For-eign Nuclear Programs Division at DOE. Mr. Speaker, their service will al-ways be appreciated, with congratula-tions for being members of the Wilson team. In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th in the global war on terrorism. Our sympathy to the family of Diane Wells; her husband, Joey; and children Eli, Maya, and Emma.

Since then, he has composed numer-ous operas, including a grand opera based on William Kennedy’s 2014 novel, ‘‘Roscoe,’’ that received a concert per-formance with the Albany Symphony featuring Deborah Voigt in 2016. He also cowrote one of the first-ever operas for Twitter, #IsOperaDead, a five-act opera performed in the span of 1 minute and 40 seconds. He also serves on the faculty at Skidmore College and was a resident artist at the prestigious Yaddo. Professor Evan Mack, on behalf of all of your many fans and supporters in upstate New York, congratulations on being named a 2018 Professional of the Year by Musical America.

CONGRATULATING THE RAINES AND MANDARIN HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL TEAMS (Mr. RUTHERFORD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Raines High School football team for winning the Florida 4A State championship and, also, the Mandarin High School football team for winning the Florida 8A State championship. Raines High School now has won two straight State titles, while Mandarin just captured their first State football championship ever. This marks the first time in history that two public schools from Duval County, Florida, have won the State championship in the same season. Football is a big part of Florida cul-ture. Many kids grow up with dreams of winning the championship under those Friday night lights, and these student athletes have demonstrated the commitment and work ethic to be successful both on the field and in the classroom. I congratulate them for bringing home some hardware to northeast Florida where it belongs, and I look forward to more championships to come. Congratulations once again to Man-darin and Raines football on a victory these players will remember for the rest of their lives. 
f 
CONGRATULATING ALIQUIPPA HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL TEAM (Mr. ROTHFUS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, it was a fitting end to an outstanding season for the Aliquippa High School football team. They were victorious in 14 of their 15 games. The Quips, led by their new head coach and former quarterback, Mike Warfield, fought their way to a re-sounding victory as they became Class 3A State football champions. The 35–0 win against Middletown High School resulted in the Quips’ third PIAA State championship. The Aliquippa football team has been a perennial contender for State foot-ball titles. This season, a powerhouse offense outscored teams by more than 700 points, and a formidable defense shut out 7 of their 15 opponents. The Quips team also won the WPIAL championship, and Coach Warfield be-came only the third coach in WPIAL history to win a State championship in his first year. Congratulations to Aliquippa High School, Coach Warfield, the coaching staff, and the team for their out-standing achievement. They have made western Pennsylvania proud. f 
FOREVER GI BILL HOUSING PAYMENT FULFILLMENT ACT (Mr. BARR asked and was given per-mission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my legislation, the For-ever GI Bill Housing Payment Fulfill-ment Act, which will hold the Depart-ment of Veterans Affairs accountable for properly and retroactively paying student veterans the educational hous-ing benefits they have earned. This legislation, introduced in re-sponse to the VA’s failure to comply with the reimbursement rates set by the Forever GI Bill, requires the VA to correct all delayed payments and un-derpayments no later than January 1, 2020. The Forever GI Bill provides housing benefits to thousands of Kentucky’s ac-tive military reservists and veterans as they pursue higher education. Our Nation’s veterans deserve better than to face financial distress, or even eviction, as a result of inaccurate or late payments. This legislation will remedy this undue hardship placed on veteran students and provide oversight and accountability to ensure these pay-ments are made in a timely manner in the future. Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-leagues to support this legislation to provide relief and certainty to our Na-tion’s veterans, and I look forward to its swift passage.

HONORING THE LIFE OF STAFF SERGEANT MAXIMO FLORES (Mrs. LESKO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I ask for the members of the Arizona delegation to join me. Mr. Speaker, I and the rest of the Ar-izona delegation want to take a minute to honor the life of Staff Sergeant Maximo Flores. On December 6, Staff Sergeant Maximo Flores was killed during a midair collision involving a marine re-fueling aircraft and a fighter jet off the coast of Japan. Staff Sergeant Flores always wanted to be a marine, and he did not waste a moment. After his 2009 graduation from Valley Vista High School in Sur-prise, Arizona, in my district, he en-listed in the Marines and pursued the aviation field. His military service made his family proud, even as he lived in distant loca-tions such as Japan, where he most re-cently served with Marine Aerial Re-fueler Transport Squadron 152 at Ma-rine Corps Air Station Iwakuni. As Americans, we are uncondition-ally bound together by the value of freedom. Staff Sergeant Maximo Flores enlisted in the Marines and gave his life to keep our country safe. His serv-ice symbolizes the values America stands for. It represents the freedom he fought for, and for that I am eternally grateful. We can never repay the debt our Na-tion owes Staff Sergeant Flores or his family, but we will always remember him and how he led his life in the serv-ice of others. His family and loved ones are in our prayers as they grieve during this try-ing time, and Arizona is forever grate-ful for Staff Sergeant Flores’ service and dedication to our country. f 
RECOGNIZING THE STORY OF THE FORCE FAMILY (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her re-marks.) Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the story of dear friends of mine, Robert and Donna Force, who are deeply committed to carrying on the tradition of family farming. Robert served honorably as a member of the 106th Rescue Wing, a unit of the Army National Guard. In 1986, Robert and Donna Force purchased 96 acres of land in Gilbertsville, New York. It is where they would spend the next 26 years building their farm and growing their family. All told, by 2010, the family had ex-panded to 111 acres of land in the beau-tiful Catskill region of upstate New York. The family viewed the farm as their retreat, a place of many happy memories. They cleared the land to build a barn, renovated their farm-house, and planted new trees across the landscape. Sadly, in 2014, the Forces were forced off their land due to an accounting error in their local county. The county failed to cooperate with them, instead putting their lovely farm up for sale and auction. Mr. Force, as a veteran, also cared for his wife, Donna, who was suffering grave, life-threatening medical prob-lems through this and up until today. The Force family believes this is part of a larger plan to push families off their property, auctioning land to the highest bidder. Since that day, the Forces have con-tinued to fight to save their farm, their

HONORING FIREFIGHTERS, POLICE OFFICERS, AND FIRST RESPOND-ERS (Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the brave firefighters, police officers, and first responders who selflessly ran into harm’s way answering the three-alarm call to the devastating fire in my dis-trict at First Baptist Church Bossier City, Louisiana, on December 10, 2018. At 5:36 a.m., the Bossier City Fire De-partment responded to a fire alarm at the church. The call for a second alarm went out at 5:50 a.m., and the Shreve-port Fire Department was called to as-sist at 6:15 a.m. During their efforts, there were a total of 30 firefighting units and 65 fire and support personnel from Bossier City and Shreveport working to con-tain the fire and preserve the church. First Bossier has such an extraor-dinary history in our region, and its iconic steeple has been a landmark over Bossier for generations. My wife, Kelly, and I were actually married in First Bossier’s Faith Chapel 20 years ago. We are so grateful there was no loss of life or major injury to anyone; and for the many extraordinary firefighters and first responders from Bossier and Shreveport who battled the blazes that day, we commend them for their heroic efforts, and we thank them for their service and sacrifice. We know the First Bossier family will pull together and recover from this tragedy even stronger than before. The Bible teaches that trials produce perse-verance, character, and hope, and we believe that to our core. The mission of First Bossier will continue in earnest, and its best days are truly ahead.

PUERTO RICO INTEGRITY IN MEDICARE ADVANTAGE ACT (Miss GONZA´LEZ-COLO´N of Puerto Rico asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Miss GONZA´LEZ-COLO´N of Puerto Rico. Mr. Speaker, healthcare infra-structure in Puerto Rico remains dan-gerously unstable. Unlike the main-land, most Medicare beneficiaries with part A and part B coverage receive their care through local Medicare Ad-vantage plans. In 2011, Puerto Rico’s per patient, per month was $595, and now it is $511. The national average was $787, and now it is $826. That is a negative impact of $315 for Puerto Rico. That means that, next year, the average Medicare Advantage rate for Puerto Rico is even 25 percent below the other territories and 43 per-cent below the national rates. This is the reason why physicians and medical providers are leaving the island. That is the reason we filed H.R. 6809, which will rectify this disparity with Medicare Advantage rates. That is the reason I ask my colleagues to sup-port this bill. f 
NEW FARM BILL HELPS AMERICA’S FOOD PANTRIES (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to ad-dress the House for 1 minute and to re-vise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, during the holiday sea-son, many people step up to help their neighbors in need. Americans are gen-erous and charitable with their time and energy through both monetary do-nations and volunteer opportunities. Food pantries play an important role all year long in communities across America. In 2017, an estimated 15 mil-lion households in the United States were food insecure, which means they lack consistent access to a sufficient quantity of affordable, nutritious food. While this number has decreased from previous years, there is much work yet to be done. That is why, as chairman of the Nutrition Sub-committee on the Agriculture Com-mittee, I advocated for an increase in TEFAP dollars in the 2018 farm bill. TEFAP stands for The Emergency Food Assistance Program. Along with donations, TEFAP funding is the cor-nerstone of our food banks. I am pleased that we were able to in-crease funding for this important life-line for so many. Food banks are meet-ing the needs for low-income Ameri-cans, the working poor, and those who have fallen on hard times. We must al-ways work towards the ultimate goal of ending hunger in America.

b2030 HONORING THE LIFE OF FREDI SIMPSON (Mr. NEWHOUSE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life, service, and spirit of my friend, Fredi Simpson. Fredi was well known and admired in central Washington. She was filled with passion and dedicated her time to improving her community and lending a helping hand to whomever was in need. She was a dear friend of mine, and I will miss her very much. Dedicated to the conservative cause, Fredi’s engagement in politics was in-spiring to everyone around her. She served as a mentor to young people and encouraged them to get involved at the local, State, and national levels. As national committeewoman, she represented Washington State with in-fectious enthusiasm and deep integrity. She traveled across our great State and the entire country leaving a positive impression on everyone she met. So, today, I reflect on my own joyful memories with Fredi, and I find peace in knowing she is at rest and reunited with God. My prayers go out for her husband Bruce, her son Kane, and all her loved ones, and I urge my colleagues to join me in celebrating her wonderful life. Fredi, we will miss you. f

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H10325 December 19, 2018 
FAREWELL TO CONGRESS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-uary 3, 2017, the gentleman from Flor-ida (Mr. C
URBELO ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the major-ity leader. Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speak-er, politics is the art of what is pos-sible, what is achievable—not the measure of our differences. We come to this Chamber—we should—to seek common ground, to solve problems, to address challenges. That is what I have done over the course of the last 4 years: work with my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to improve quality of life in our country, in our communities, and to show the American public that this in-stitution is capable of responding to its concerns and its aspirations. In Congress, progress is measured in small units, the way our Founding Fa-thers intended. On climate and the environment, we broke the ice, bringing Republicans and Democrats together in the Climate Solutions Caucus, the first meaningful bipartisan dialogue and collaboration effort on this subject in a generation. We also filed landmark legislation that would make massive investments in American infrastructure while reduc-ing carbon emissions and creating clean energy jobs. Climate change and transportation infrastructure—twin challenges threat-ening the future of my home, Miami- Dade County. The Market Choice Act would make it more likely that our children and grandchildren can live out their years in our paradise, an area marked and blessed with countless nat-ural treasures. On immigration, we forced the House to process and debate comprehensive reform for the first time in nearly a decade. While for many, using this sub-ject and the many victims of a broken immigration system for political gain is the preference, ours was a solution that would secure the border, reform our asylum laws to prevent abuse, keep families together, and secure a future for 2 million American Dreamers—the young immigrants who went to school with our own children and today are contributing to our economy and to our communities. While the forces of obstruction and cowardice prevailed, this institution grew from the debate, and dividends will be reaped in the future, I have no doubt. This issue is also a special one for Miami-Dade and south Florida. It is personal for us. We are a community of immigrants. We believe immigration should be legal and orderly, and we know immigrants made America great and will continue making it greater still. Guns—another issue that deeply di-vides our country. We proposed solu-tions modeled after what was achieved in Florida in the wake of the tragic massacre at Parkland’s Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. It is possible to protect gun rights for law- abiding citizens while keeping deadly weapons out of the hands of those who seek to harm others or themselves. We are reforming our criminal justice sys-tem in order to truly give people a sec-ond chance. We secured funding for Everglades restoration, for water quality improve-ments in the Florida Keys, for impor-tant infrastructure projects in south Florida. We honored our troops by guaranteeing them the resources they need and granting them the raises they have earned. We also invested in Amer-ican children, making it easier for im-migrant students to learn English and protecting the accountability frame-work that put all students at the cen-ter of the public education system. And we delivered historic tax relief for Florida workers and families while making American businesses more competitive. In our hemisphere, I have advocated for the oppressed people of Cuba, Ven-ezuela, and Nicaragua, and encouraged the administration to forge strong re-lationships with leaders committed to human rights, the rule of law, and eco-nomic growth and prosperity in coun-tries like Brazil, Colombia, Argentina, Chile, Ecuador, Costa Rica, Panama, and others. In the Middle East, I have worked to support and bolster the critical U.S.- Israel alliance while holding the ter-rorist mullah regime in Iran account-able for its countless transgressions. And further east, I have advocated for closer relations with important allies like Japan and Taiwan in the face of China’s growing hostility. Most importantly, every day I have put my south Florida community and the country above any partisan or per-sonal interest. My goal has always been to serve with sincerity and de-cency, to call it honest no matter who might get upset. And even if political consequences would follow, to focus on ideas instead of petty politics, to speak in truth instead of talking points, to be both direct and decorous. While I have learned much from this institution, it never changed me. I have served to the fullest every day, and I now begin a new chapter in my life overflowing with gratitude for this wonderful opportunity to serve, for the many colleagues I have come to know, for my team, for my family, my God, and for the community that trusted this child of political refugees with the privilege of representing it here in the Congress of the United States of Amer-ica. Mr. Speaker, I yield to my colleague, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. R
OD-
NEYDAVIS). Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Flor-ida for yielding. I know he is probably worried about what I might say in this final speech here on the floor tonight, but I have got to tell you about a friend that I met just shortly after going to a meeting across the street where I had the honor of becoming a mentor to a candidate who wanted to run for Congress. His name was CARLOS CURBELO , and I knew we were going to get along well when I called him the first time on the phone and he said: ‘‘Why are you my mentor?’’ I said: ‘‘Because you have Key West in the district you are win-ning in. I would like to come visit you.’’ He took my first joke well, and we hit it off and became very close friends. And imagine my glee when, on election night, in 2014, my mentee became a newly elected Member of Congress. And to see him walk into this institution, to see him immediately become, not just a friend to me and to many others, but a legislator and one of the best leg-islators I have ever had the oppor-tunity to serve with. It is bittersweet for me to stand here tonight and wish him the best in his next endeavors. I know he will have plenty of opportunities to spend a great deal of time with his wife Ceci and their two lovely young daughters in one of the most beautiful places in the world, in Miami-Dade. But I have got a feeling this isn’t going to be the last for my friend, Mr. C
URBELO . And this speech may be the last one he delivers as a Member of this institution, but whether it is he comes back here or whatever his next step is, he knows that it is not only me who is going to be standing there right behind him, but so many of his colleagues and friends that he has met along the way and has meant so much to. I thank him for being a great friend. I thank him for being a member of the wolf pack, and I will always know him as my good friend, C
HUCK CURBELO . Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speak-er, I thank the gentleman from Illinois, who indeed is a wonderful friend. Sometimes his jokes aren’t as good, but his advice has been very good here since I started running for the House for the first time in 2013. The people of southern Illinois are blessed to be represented by Mr. D
AVIS. He is a wonderful family man. He is a great friend, and even though I am moving on, I am very happy to know that people like R
ODNEY DAVIS will re-main a part of this institution working for his community and for our wonder-ful country. Now, Mr. Speaker, I yield to my col-league from Pennsylvania (Mr. C
OS-
TELLO ), another wonderful friend. We have shared many great experiences to-gether. We have worked hard on the issues that are important to our com-munities, to our districts. Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I thank C
ARLOS for his service to this country, to his constituents. He has been an exemplar of what it means to be a gentleman, somebody who comes in to work here every day in the Halls of Congress, serving the people, doing his best, giving it 110 percent. What I would like to do, if I could, is just thank those residents in my con-gressional district residing in Chester

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH10326 December 19, 2018 
County, Pennsylvania; Montgomery County, Pennsylvania; Berks County, Pennsylvania; and Lebanon County, Pennsylvania, for the opportunity to serve you here in Congress for 2 terms. This was always, admittedly, a dream of mine, and it is something that I took great pride in doing. It has been a very humbling experience. In some respects, it has been a very re-warding experience. In other respects, it has been challenging and frustrating at times. But when you are someone who puts your name on a sign and gets elected to this institution, you carry with yourself a certain humbleness and a certain sense of purpose that every single one of the 434 Members that I have served with—probably more since there has been resignations and reelec-tions—but everyone who I have served with in this institution takes their job very, very seriously, and I just hope the American people realize that even as we have differences here, we have a lot more that binds us together as Americans, and everyone is here trying to do their very best. b2045 I would also like to, real briefly, just thank my parents, Sherry and Tony, for their support through the years; my wife, Christine; my children, Ryan and Caroline; and the many great members of my staff who have just done an abso-lutely wonderful job. I think one thing that every single Member of Congress can universally agree to is that the staff is underappreciated, undercom-pensated; but without them, this insti-tution would not run, and we would not be able to be as effective as we are day in and day out. I would particularly like to recognize Lauryn Schothorst and Dante Cutrona, my chiefs of staff through the years; Kori Walter, my district director; Jason Carver, my constituent services director; and if I start naming all the other staff persons, I would probably forget one. But I just want each and every one of them to know how person-ally grateful I am for their service to Pennsylvania’s Sixth Congressional District, this country, and myself. And for all those whom I have served with, from the bottom of my heart, thank you for being a friend and being an advocate for this country and for your constituents all across this coun-try. This is a very special institution. It has been a real privilege to serve in it. God bless each and every one of you, and God bless America. Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speak-er, I want to thank my colleague, Mr. C
OSTELLO , for his kind words, and I also want to commend him for his great service to our country. The peo-ple of Philadelphia’s suburbs have been blessed to have been represented over the last 4 years by a thoughtful, hon-est, decent man, someone whom I worked with very closely on issues like the environment, like immigration, the difficult issues, the controversial issues, the issues where legislators are required to take risks if they are going to have a positive impact. My final message is just extreme gratitude to this wonderful institution, to my community for this privilege, this opportunity. To my parents, Teresita and CARLOS CURBELO , when they arrived in this country with noth-ing except the desire to be free and to work and contribute, I don’t think they could have ever imagined that their son would be able to serve in this fine institution. Only in this wonderful country can we tell stories like that. Only in this wonderful country do these miracles happen. I also want to thank my wife and my two daughters—Cecilia, my wife, and Sylvie and Carolina, my daughters—be-cause public service is difficult, espe-cially on young families, and my wife and my daughters have sacrificed a lot. Of course, we have done it with the support of our family, my in-laws, my parents, my friends, and everyone. Again, to all my colleagues, I wish you the best. I will be rooting for you. Please continue trying to help strengthen this country, continue try-ing to do the right thing every day and serve with a servant’s heart. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
f 
HOUSE FREEDOM CAUCUS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-uary 3, 2017, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. M
EADOWS ) for 30 minutes. Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to encourage my colleagues to stay in the fight to make sure that we help this President deliver on a prom-ise that he made years ago. I am sad that tonight we are here, and we are on a backdrop of a potential government shutdown; but, really, what it is is more a function of the fact that we have not done our job like we should have done already. The President, many, many months ago, said that he would not sign an-other funding bill unless we gave him wall funding. So what did this House do? It passed a bill to fund the Depart-ment of Defense and passed a short- term CR. And they said: Do you know what? We are going to have that fight, but we are going to have that fight after the midterms. Well, Mr. Speaker, it is after the midterms, and we are here with a num-ber of my colleagues tonight to say that we are ready to fight on behalf of all the freedom-loving Americans to make sure that we have secure borders and that never again do we have to worry about terrorists and drug traf-fickers coming across our southern borders. So I have a number of my colleagues tonight, Mr. Speaker, who want to speak on this to encourage the Amer-ican people to stand with us in this fight. I yield to the gentleman from Ari-zona (Mr. BIGGS). Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I am grate-ful that my colleagues are here stand-ing up for the crisis, to solve the crisis on the border. Securing the United States and the American people, this border, is a fun-damental, constitutional responsibility of the Federal Government. We have Members of the House and Senate who are still unwilling to ensure we have control over our borders, unwilling to ensure we know who enters the United States, and unwilling to enforce our immigration laws. Some of the opposition has forgotten their previous support for border walls back then, before they didn’t fun-damentally disagree with border secu-rity or the border wall. But now they simply don’t want President Trump or elected Republicans to get a win. What they want is open borders. In 2006, some of the Democrats still in the Senate today, including Minor-ity Leader C
HUCK SCHUMER , voted in favor of the Secure Fence Act to build a southern border wall. For now, Republicans still control Congress. Rumor is that our leaders are negotiating a deal to avert a shut-down and fund the government through February 8. Once again, we are kicking the fight for border security down the road. When are we going to stand up and fight, if not now? Our coalition of Members here have drafted an amendment that would allow us to deliver on our promise to make the necessary policy changes to end catch and release, increase the number of immigration judges, and provide $5 billion in border wall fund-ing. In all of the debate about borders and illegal immigration, many of the head-lines focus on those who have come here illegally, but I urge you to re-member people on the American side of the border. Remember the ranchers and residents living along the border who are impacted by smuggling and traf-ficking that goes on because of our lack of will in this body. Remember our Border Patrol agents who risk their lives every day trying to keep us secure. I urge my colleagues in the House and our leadership to think about what is best for America. Is it the status quo, or is it standing up to fight for the security and sovereignty of our Na-tion? Clearly, we must stand up and fight now. I urge my fellow Members to sup-port funding for the border wall before January 3 comes; and if we have to, I am willing to stay here to make sure that happens. Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to another gentleman from Arizona (Mr. G
OSAR ). Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from North Carolina for yielding.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H10327 December 19, 2018 
Mr. Speaker, a study came out ear-lier this year that said the opioid epi-demic today is deadlier than the Viet-nam war in 1968. That study found that opioids had cost our country more than 1.7 million years of life. Those are mo-ments of joy, family, and community that are lost irrevocably. And as we move into the Christmas season, it is worth thinking about the millions of American families dealing with addic-tion and overdose tragedies. We have done a great deal in Con-gress to try to fight the epidemic, from beefing up grants, to tougher law en-forcement, to fixing the pain medica-tion guidelines, to cracking down on bad actors in the pharmaceutical in-dustry. But we have not addressed the immigration issue, which is central to the crisis. The book, ‘‘Dreamland,’’ written by veteran L.A. Times Reporter Sam Quinones, provides one of the most de-finitive accounts of how we got to this grim place we are today. It details how Mexican nationals south of Arizona pi-oneered a new model of drug distribu-tion, decentralized and customer cen-tric, that successfully flooded our towns and cities with black tar heroin just as the availability of prescription opioids was ebbing. Our porous border was the lynchpin of that model in two ways: One, it allowed traffickers to be caught by police, to be deported, and to reenter the country, ensuring an un-broken stream of illegal labor for traf-ficking organizations; Two, it allowed drug dealers to dis-play their ill-gotten gains at home in Mexico, gaining status in their towns by poisoning our people. That is above and beyond the simple fact that an insecure border allows massive amounts of drugs to be smug-gled into our country. Make no mistake, we are under chemical attack. Fentanyl is so potent that even a small amount, the equiva-lent of a few grains of salt, can be le-thal. Earlier this year, police seized enough fentanyl to kill 26 million Americans. Securing the border is a matter of life and death. We have got to build the wall. This amendment that we are talking about here would provide the $5 billion that the President has asked for and ensures that he has the legal au-thority he needs to get it done. Let’s back the President and the American people here in the House today and put the wall money in the funding bill. It is not going to happen under N
ANCY PELOSI , that much is cer-tain. Now is the time. This is the bill, and this is the body, and we are at the right place. The American people can’t afford any more delay. Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. P
ERRY ). Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, we are here to talk about the promise that we made to the American people. As the proud son of immigrants, my great-grandmother escaped the child bride situation in Colombia and came here with the shirt on her back and her little girl and just enough skills to make it through in America, and she did it legally. We are a compassionate country who supports legal immigration, but we are here to talk about illegal immigration and the one chance we have left to solve that. Border security is a bipartisan issue, and it is not just about a wall or a fence. It is about stopping things like illegal immigration and human traf-ficking, because seeing little girls sold into sex slavery into this country is not a compassionate thing for the American taxpayer to be a part of. It is about declining economic condi-tions for America’s working poor, knowing that the average high school dropout in America makes about $25,000 a year and, over the last 20 years, that has increased the amount of people, through illegal immigration, who don’t have a high school diploma by about 25 percent. Who is standing up for the working poor that were born in this country? And then there is the abuse of the American taxpayer. Pennsylvanians, where I represent a portion of the pop-ulation, paid an additional $1.3 billion in taxes this year for things like edu-cation, incarceration, healthcare, and a whole raft of social services. Senior citizens struggling to pay their property taxes in Pennsylvania risk losing their homes paying for those kind of things, and it is com-pletely avoidable. There is the rise of the opioid crisis, where fentanyl, across the border, the southern border, has increased 750 per-cent since the beginning of the year. I talked to my DAs today. In the two major counties I represent, that is one death a day due to opioid and fentanyl overdose. Then there is the potential for ter-rorism through our southern border, where our Border Patrol says that they seize 10 terrorists a day. Mr. Speaker, regardless of all those reasons that I have just outlined, there is still just one more that is the most important, and that is that we made a promise to the American people to se-cure the border. This is our last chance. NANCY PELOSI will not do this, and the American people are counting on us to do what we said we would do. And that is why I am advocating for the funding package for the border in the CR, or I have to say ‘‘no.’’ Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. J
OR-
DAN). Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, everyone knows the old line: Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me. But we are going to have to change that line. We are going to need a new one. The new line should be: Fool the American people four times, shame on Congress. Remember what we did in March? The March big omnibus spending bill? We said: Oh, no. We are not going to put the border wall funding on this bill because we are going to do it in Sep-tember. Then we get to September and say: Do you know what? Wait a minute. We are not going to put it on this bill be-cause we are going to do it on Decem-ber 7. And then December 7 has come: Wait a minute. We are not going to keep our promise. We are not going to put the border wall funding money on that bill. We are going to do it December 21. And what did we learn today? Now they are talking about kicking it to February 8. You have got to be kidding me. Really? I mean, February 8, when NANCY  P
ELOSI is Speaker, I am supposed to be-lieve—we are supposed to believe that we are then going to build the border security wall and keep our promise from the 2016 campaign? No way. Four different times we promised something and then kicked the can down the road. I will tell you this: You know when else we should have done it? March, September, December 7. And now do you know when we really should have done it? Last week. Last week when the President of the United States stood in the Oval Office and told Congresswoman P
ELOSI : NANCY , this is fine. This is fine. We don’t need to go behind closed doors. Transparency is a good thing. Let’s do what we said. Let’s build the border security wall that we should have passed last week. Instead of tak-ing a 6-day weekend, we should have passed it last week. So I am sick of the games. The House Freedom Caucus is sick of the games. More importantly—most importantly— the American people are sick of the games. b2100 So just like Congressman P
ERRY said, let’s do what we said. We make this job way, way too difficult. It is pretty sim-ple. What did you tell the voters you were going to do? What did they elect you to do? Go do that. Mr. Speaker, tomorrow, the Freedom Caucus is going to do that. We have an amendment. We have an amendment that says $5 billion for the wall, reform our asylum laws, fix the problem—a commonsense, basic amendment that everyone in this country knows needs to be done. And now is the time to do it. We didn’t do it the four times before, but now is the time to do it. So let’s get it done this week. Let’s do what we said. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the chair-man’s leadership of our group. I appre-ciate his Special Order tonight. We know what we have to do. Let’s just do it. Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I couldn’t agree with the gentleman more. It is time that we deliver on be-half of the American people and fulfill the promises that the President made many months ago.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH10328 December 19, 2018 
Mr. Speaker, I recognize the gen-tleman from New Mexico (Mr. P
EARCE ), someone who has been key in that, who knows this problem better than most, because he represents a district in New Mexico. Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the time. Mr. Speaker, I do represent the Sec-ond District of New Mexico. That is the part of New Mexico that lies on the border with Mexico. Make no mistake about it: This issue is one that is important to the entire Nation. We are talking about a single subject, and that is securing the bor-der. That is all the discussion is about. The rest of the spending in the bill, maybe it is right, maybe it is wrong, but that is not part of the discussion. The discussion is: Are we going to se-cure the border or not? The gentleman from Ohio had it ex-actly right, that the President sat there and said we are going to take this in front of the American people. He said: I will take responsibility for it, and we are going to have that dis-cussion. But then the Speaker of this House has said we are not going to have the discussion. We came here as Members of Con-gress to make important decisions, sometimes very weighty decisions, sometimes very hard decisions. Frank-ly, this decision is not that hard: Se-cure the border. That is it. That is all we are asking for from this institution and from our friends in the Senate, but somehow we are find-ing that that is too hard an ask. The American people don’t think it is too hard an ask. It is not that it is a racial question. The Second District of New Mexico is 52 percent Hispanic, 60 percent overall minority. They agree. No matter how they feel on immigration, no matter how they feel on amnesty, they agree that the border must be secure. They agree that we must know who is com-ing here and why they are coming here. As we watched the people gathered in Tijuana, there are concerns about ex-actly who makes up this group. A se-cure border allows us to answer those questions. An open border does not allow us to answer those questions. So I am here tonight to stand with my friends in the Freedom Caucus to say to the Speaker, to say to the lead-ers, that we simply need to take up this question. We have the amendment. It is very straightforward, very simple. Mr. Speaker, I support the amend-ment. I support the question: Will we secure the border? The answer should be yes. Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I recognize the gen-tleman from Georgia (Mr. J
ODY B. H
ICE). Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from North Carolina for recognizing me tonight. Mr. Speaker, we all know that immi-gration continues to be one of the most pressing issues that we are facing in our country today. The question of ille-gal immigration is not going away. In fact, it is growing. It is getting worse. It is getting more complex with each passing day, and Congress has repeat-edly failed to take any action whatso-ever. We have the opportunity now in this spending bill to finally deliver results for the American people—again, some-thing that we have not done over and over and over again. The Department of Homeland Secu-rity has reported that, roughly, on av-erage, 2,000 illegal aliens are crossing our southern border every day. Now we learn from Border Patrol that, in re-cent months, there has been an in-crease of 90 percent attempted illegal individuals crossing our borders com-pared to this time last year. The border crisis is for real, and it is time for us to act. The President has requested $5 bil-lion. That is really not a whole lot of money compared to the $1.3 trillion that we spend in discretionary spend-ing every year. Look, the wall is not the whole an-swer, but it is the first step, because walls work. Wherever there have been walls put in place, there have been great results that have been produced: for example, a 92 percent drop in illegal traffic in San Diego since a wall was there; 95 percent decrease in El Paso; 90 percent decrease in Tucson. Walls work. Now, look, there are other things we need to do, some practical steps, from closing the asylum loopholes, stopping chain migration, making E-Verify mandatory. There are other things, but I hear, right now, the voices of millions of Americans from my district and across the country, as we have all heard the chant: Build the wall. Build the wall. Build the wall. We are standing here tonight as a voice for millions of Americans who feel like they have lost their voice in Washington, and we are saying it is time right now. Build the wall. Let’s do it. Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. Mr. Speaker, I recognize the gen-tleman from South Carolina (Mr. NOR-
MAN). Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this Special Order. You know, I walked in this Chamber tonight, and I thought: This brings a new meaning to ‘‘major in the minor.’’ We have something that is as impor-tant as the sovereignty of this country in securing our borders, and here we are, at the last hour, saying we are going to get out of here before Friday on something this important. You know, I was in line, getting some work done, and the President came on. He challenged Speaker P
ELOSI , and he challenged the Senator. He said: Bring the fight on. We are going to stay here. We are going to fund the wall. We are going to get the $5 billion. Now we hear talk that maybe we won’t. We are going to pass a con-tinuing resolution for 2 months. I am sick of it. Nobody can fund your business month by month by month. Here we are, abdicating our constitu-tional obligations to make this coun-try sovereign. As has been pointed out by Mr. MEADOWS and Mr. J ORDAN , the drugs, all the things that come into this coun-try—I am for immigration, but it is legal immigration. We need to sit up here as long as it takes. If it is the next 6 months, sit up here until we get it. If we think we are going to get it when the gavel passes on January 3, it is not going to happen. I support what we are doing. Now is the time for us to have a backbone, finally, and support this country and make sovereign bor-ders a law. Fund it. You know, $5 billion? How did the previous administration get $153 billion to give to a rogue country? We can’t come up with $5 billion? It is sad, to say the least. I support what we are doing. Hope-fully, we can get this thing done. Sit-ting up here, it is time to fight. Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time I have re-maining. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-tleman has 13 minutes remaining. Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I recog-nize the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. G
RIFFITH ), my good friend. Mr. GRIFFITH. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for recognizing me to-night. I appreciate it. Recognizing that the time is drawing short, and we have lots of other people who want to speak on this issue, I will attempt to keep myself in check on the time. Mr. Speaker, everybody knows we have to secure our border. When we talk about building the wall, we are not talking just about bricks and mor-tar. We are talking about securing our borders with all devices available to us, whether that be drones or smart fences like they have in Israel where they pro-tect 17 miles of border with a fence that, if something hits it, they send people out to see what is going on. We have to use all the tools in the toolbox. And the $5 billion is just the start on what we need to do to protect all of our borders, but it is an impor-tant start. We have heard about the drug crisis, and all of our districts are affected by it. A lot of times, people say in the mountains of southwest Virginia: Mor-gan, why are you so concerned about this illegal immigration? Let me tell you why. The Mexican drug cartels are bringing methamphet-amine into my district. They use it as a distribution area. They are the main supplier of that drug. Now that we have gotten opioids a little bit under con-trol, and we are starting to get that where it should be, the Mexican cartels are our biggest problem in the moun-tains of southwest Virginia.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H10329 December 19, 2018 
It is important that we secure our borders, build the wall, protect the American people, protect our borders, and protect our laws. Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. Mr. Speaker, I recognize the gen-tleman from North Carolina (Mr. B
UDD), my good friend. Mr. BUDD. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for recognizing me tonight. Mr. Speaker, we know our immigra-tion system is broken and desperately in need of reform. No sovereign coun-try in the world is scrutinized the way America is just for simply wanting to secure our borders. For decades, the United States has taken in millions of immigrants. In fact, that number is about a million per year, and that is something we are going to continue to do. Immigrants, historically, have been a major asset to the growth and pros-perity of our country. However, the issue before America is not legal immi-gration but illegal immigration. It is interesting to me that, through-out the years, Democrats have sup-ported securing our borders. In 2006, the Secure Fence Act was signed into law by President Bush authorizing 700 miles of border fence and $50 billion in total maintenance. That is a far stretch from the small $5 billion, in comparison, that President Trump is asking for today. We should remember that the Secure Fence Act passed through Congress with bold and broad Democrat support. So in 2013, we should also remember that Senator S
CHUMER himself spon-sored a bill that invested $46 billion in border security improvements that added 700 miles of border fencing. That is $41 billion more than what President Trump is currently asking for. So what changed, Mr. Speaker, be-tween now and then? Simply, politics. Politics is the only thing that has changed. But, to me, securing our country’s borders and making sure peo-ple feel safe should be above politics. Our ICE agents and Border Patrol need the necessary resources to do their jobs effectively and with con-fidence. It is hard to plug a leak when you are working with the wrong tools. The solution is simply to shut off the water at the source. In closing, I would pose these ques-tions to my friends across the aisle: If now is not the time to secure our bor-der, then when is? If not today, then when? And where do we go from here? If we can’t come together to solve a problem that both Republicans and Democrats know exists, I worry that our tribal political environment will hold the security of American citizens hostage for years to come. Mr. Speaker, I urge my Democrat colleagues to turn back the clock and remember a time when putting the country first was more important than putting the party first. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his friendship and for his time. Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. Mr. Speaker, I recognize the gen-tleman from Alabama (Mr. PALMER ). Mr. PALMER. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to call upon this body to fulfill its duty to protect the American people. Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to claim that strength-ening border security is about sepa-rating families or preventing them from immigrating to the U.S. In re-ality, it is about protecting the Amer-ican people by stopping the flow of dan-gerous individuals across the southern border. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Nielsen has confirmed that ISIS has produced written materials that encourage ISIS followers to cross our Southwest border, given the loop-holes that they are also aware of, and that, on average, her department now blocks 10 known or suspected terrorists a day from traveling to or attempting to enter the United States. The four individuals shown here, one of whom had been previously identified and flagged for insurgency/terrorism, were stopped in Panama while trying to make their way to the U.S. Thanks to a fortunate tip and coordination be-tween U.S. and Panamanian law en-forcement, these individuals were stopped. This should be alarming to every American, especially concerning the dangerous individuals we may have missed and will continue to miss due to our lack of robust border security. I am proud of the job our Border Pa-trol and law enforcement officers are doing to protect their country, and I urge my colleagues to do our duty to protect the American people from dan-gerous individuals by taking border se-curity seriously and fully funding the President’s proposal for border secu-rity. Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. Mr. Speaker, I recognize the gen-tleman from Texas (Mr. C
LOUD ). Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for recognizing me tonight. Mr. Speaker, tonight I speak to the humanitarian and criminal crisis at our southern border. This crisis has been permitted to exist because of Congress’ failure to act. For over 30 years, the American people have been promised results, but they have received empty promises. We know from history that our southern border wall works. This is not a new concept. Where we have imple-mented a wall, we have seen great suc-cess in curbing illicit activity. Our Nation is a generous nation, one of the most diverse in the world, and our generosity is being taken advan-tage of by illegal cartels across our southern border. These cartels have created a humanitarian and criminal crisis that abuses the rule of law and costs innocent lives. Cartels recruit and send migrants across our border, making thousands of dollars a person, in a strategy to tax our human resources and distract from our enforcement against drug traf-ficking. As the Representative of the 27th District of Texas, the southern part of my district is just 2 hours from the border. b2115 I know the good men and women who serve on our southern border, and they always prioritize life. Cartels know this and take advantage of it. Failure to complete a southern bor-der wall and loopholes in our asylum laws have created a magnet for illegal immigration. According to DHS, around 80 percent of asylum cases that go to a hearing are rejected by the judge as illegitimate. DHS spokesman Tyler Houlton point-ed out earlier this year that smugglers and traffickers understand our broken immigration laws better than most. The catch-and-release process, whereby migrants come into the coun-try and are issued a date to appear in court, often years away, are released into the interior, and it is driving this humanitarian crisis. ICE reports that the number of migrants, including many women and children seeking entry, has increased dramatically in recent years. They often find them-selves at risk for assault and abuse, such as rape, beatings, kidnapping, and robbery. Tonight, Mr. Speaker, we are here advocating for an end to the humani-tarian and criminal crisis on our south-ern border caused by Congress’ failure to act. This means ending the status quo, funding border security, and clos-ing the loopholes in our broken asylum system. Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time I have re-maining. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-tleman from North Carolina has 3 min-utes remaining. Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. B
ABIN). Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, ‘‘securing our border’’ is a term that we have heard so often it has lost its punch in-side the beltway. But that doesn’t mean the American people have forgot-ten about it. We made a promise to our folks to se-cure our borders, and we have to keep that promise. Without question, fund-ing to build a wall is necessary, and now is our chance to do it. Many sec-tions of our border cannot be secured without a wall, and Congress must act to ensure that it is built. But bad poli-cies like catch and release must be ad-dressed by Congress as well. Take the recent quotes and actions from many of the migrants who have been in these caravans, abusing our catch-and-release policy to seek asylee status in order to work in our country. These migrants were demanding en-trance and jobs, waving foreign flags

while burning ours, cursing our govern-ment and our President, and vowing that our laws mean nothing to them. Are these people who share our alle-giances? Should we not demand a law-ful immigration system so that we can determine who we let in? Is not a se-cure border a prerequisite for that? We must increase penalties for ille-gally crossing our border. Earlier this year, I cosponsored the Zero Tolerance for Illegal Entry Act, which would make doing so a felony. This would en-courage legitimate asylum seekers to do so at authorized points of entry. This should be a component of reform. Just this week, in a story we have seen over and over, agents arrested il-legal border crossers with over 100 pounds of meth. Without our border agents, these dangerous drugs would be in our schools and in our communities. We made a promise to our constitu-ents to build this wall. We must prioritize the interests of the American people. I am willing to fight for this, and I hope that my colleagues are as well. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his leadership. Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, as I close out this particular Special Order, I think it is appropriate for us to re-mind the American people that there is a bad case of Potomac fever up here in Washington, D.C. They forget what they promised the American people, yet what they must do is not forget this time. Mr. Speaker, we are going to back up the President. If he vetoes this bill, we will be there. But, more importantly, the American people will be there. They will be there to support him. Let’s build the wall and make sure that we do our job in Congress. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

SOMEONE PLEASE WAKE ME UP The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-uary 3, 2017, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. G
AR-
RETT ) for 30 minutes. Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, some-one please wake me up. I think I am having a nightmare. What if I told you that, in the Middle East now, there is a place where Chris-tians, Muslims, Arabs, Kurds, Assyr-ians, Yazidis—women and men—all sit together at the same table, as the re-sult of the beginnings of a democratic process where tolerance and pluralism is a core value, and where we have seen safety, security, and prosperity emerge from the ashes one of the most horrific conflicts of the modern age. What if I told you that. What if I told you that a foreign state actor spent $10 million a month, to our reckoning, to influence thought in Washington, D.C., alone, to tell lies about this fledgling, tolerant democ-racy in the Middle East. What if I told you that the very Ira-nian regime that took the lives of American women and men on the bat-tlefield in Iraq was celebrating right now along with Vladimir Putin and Bashar al-Assad and Turkey’s neo- Ottoman fascist Erdogan. I can tell you all those things be-cause they are true. 
Someone please wake me up. I think I am having a nightmare. I just spent my Thanksgiving and 2 weeks of my life—a lot of money and a lot of time—away from my family to meet with brave people spanning mul-tiple ethnicities who, like the First Continental Congress, have the rec-ognition of exactly no foreign govern-ments as a legitimate emerging gov-ernment; who are different from you and me only by virtue of the happen-stance of fate that they would be born somewhere as opposed to another place; who have quite literally shed the lifeblood of their children on battle-fields that most Americans have never heard of, from Deir ez-Zor, Manbij, Jarablus; people who fought, bled, and died in homes that their families had inhabited in the Kabul River valley, the Jazeera province; and who were the tip of President Trump’s spear in root-ing out the combat components of a radical, warped, hateful ideology em-bodied by Daesh or ISIS. And today, without warning, we said good luck. The Syrian Democratic Council is not a Kurdish experiment in north and eastern Syria. It is an experiment that was largely started by Kurds, yes, but it is an experiment that includes men and women from across the ethnic and religious diversity of the region. What we read about in any publica-tion that comes out of Turkey, which has about the worst press freedom on the planet, is how the PKK has been engaged in terrorist activity in Tur-key, and anyone affiliated with the PKK by virtue of the accident of their birth as a Kurd is somehow a terrorist. Folks, this is not true. I met with everyone, from chief ex-ecutives down to city councils. When you go to Deir ez-Zor, where the bulk of the population is Arab, the city council is Arab. And when you go to Manbij, the leadership is Arab. And when you go to Jazeera, the leadership is Kurdish and Christian, and it is male and female. This Chamber that we stand in, in this venerated body, exists not only be-cause of the blood and sweat and tears of innumerable Americans not only in the Revolution but throughout our his-tory, but also because foreigners were willing to stand up in support of an idea that was freedom and self-deter-mination: Lafayette, Pulaski, Kosciuszko, von Steuben—German, Polish, French. Yet again, we betray those who have shed their blood to advance American policy. Look, don’t make the commitment to begin with. It is one thing to learn that the United States has equivocated on its policy and people died. It is an-other thing to learn that the United States is equivocating on its policy and people with whom you have broken bread are about to die. I told them when I was there: I am here on my own time. I do not formu-late American policy. I happen to be a Member of Congress, but, by God, I will stand up and be heard so that you might have the right that was be-queathed to you, not by a political ad-ministration anywhere, but by God, to live free of fear, to sleep soundly in your ancestral home, to worship or not worship as you choose. Ain Issa is the name of the town where, by happenstance, the Syrian Democratic Council has put some func-tions of its government. Ain Issa trans-lates to English as the ‘‘Eyes of Christ.’’ You can’t make this up. In my entire life, I have been proud of the 1 in 26 luck that I had to slip from the womb the son of Lois and T
OM G
ARRETT in the Commonwealth of Vir-ginia, born in Georgia, in the greatest country on the face of the planet. But how many times must we muck up the endgame: the bloodletting in Cambodia and Laos, the purges in Iraq after 1991, the betrayal of the Kurds in 1985, the ignoring of vindictive revenge killings in 2004, the encouragement and then withdrawal in 2017. Ironically, Mr. Speaker, the Russians are far more loyal friends than the Americans are. It is beyond me. Somebody wake me up. I am having a nightmare. To say that ISIS is defeated and that was our sole mission is, at the very least, to exhibit a complete lack of un-derstanding of what is going on, on the ground. I stood on the front lines near Jarablus by a building that was shot up that day by the Free Syrian Army, who we funded, at a military post manned by people of various ethnicities. And the Free Syrian Army did this while the Turkish military watched. Iranians seek to build a land bridge to the Mediterranean. Hezbollah is a wholly owned subsidiary of Iran—it functions in Israel—and is the only ter-rorist organization I know of that has taken human life on every single in-habited continent—Oceania, Australia, Asia, Europe, Africa, South America, North America. And we are just open-ing up the door. Eighty-seven people were killed in Deir ez-Zor province within 24 hours on either side of the time I visited. This wasn’t a long time ago. This was Thanksgiving. This fight is long from over. Frankly, if I am an ISIS recruiter, the idea that, ‘‘Look, the Americans are leaving,’’ will only strengthen their position. So let me make this metaphor, Mr. Speaker. We have a patient. That pa-tient is Syria. It is stricken with four cancers. There is the regime in Russia; there is Turkey; there is Iran; and there is ISIS. We have just eradicated the bulk of one cancer, dropped the scalpel, left the surgery room, and de-clared that the patient is healed.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H10331 December 19, 2018 
Candidly, the people in north and eastern Syria would be far better off if we had never come to help, because the brave women and men who have stood up to lead a democratic movement have identified themselves for extermi-nation. I sat down in Manbij with the mili-tary council, with an individual, it is my understanding, who was attacked with an IED the next day, and we have declared victory. This was 2 weeks, 3 weeks ago. So let me be clear, and let me counter some propaganda. When the only people celebrating this decision are Turkey, Iran, and Russia, it might be a bad decision. When you hear that the Syrian Democratic Council and the forces in north and eastern Syria are Kurds, that defies the reality on the ground, the reality that I saw, and the people with whom I spoke. The definition of insanity, Mr. Speaker, is doing the same thing again and again and expecting a different re-sult. Let me tell you what I know, so that a month from now, I can say, ‘‘See, I told you so,’’ and maybe I will have that because 4-plus-or-minus mil-lion people in north and eastern Syria won’t even have so much as their homes. b2130 Turkey is going into Manbij. They have been telling us that for a month. They said: We have got to get the Kurds out of Manbij. Guess what? The Kurds aren’t controlling Manbij. The Syrian Democratic Forces, which in-cludes some Kurds, are in Manbij, but they are out. This is like post-World War II Japan or Germany saying: You need to get the African-American soldiers out of Berlin. It is racist on its face, ridicu-lous, and denies the reality on the ground, and apparently, nobody in the decision-making scheme has bothered to figure out what the actual truth is. So the Turks are going into Manbij. Now, what will that look like? Well, we know what happened in Afrin and al- Bab. They fly the Turkish flag over the courthouses. They have changed the street signs to honor Ottoman sultans. I can show you a video, Mr. Speaker, of a paramilitary police force raising their right hands in a Hitleresque sa-lute shouting: ‘‘Long live Erdogan,’’ in Turkish. This is on Syrian soil. The children are educated in a dif-ferent language. And the hospital in Afrin, which used to have a sign out-side in Kurdish and Arabic, now has a sign outside in Turkish. In Jarabulus, the commanders with whom we spoke said when Turkey came in and said they rooted out ISIS, we looked through the field glasses the next day and lo and behold, the same people that were there the day before in ISIS uni-forms were there in uniforms sanc-tioned by Turkey. Oh, by the way, I just learned that we are going to sell $3.5 billion worth of Patriot missile batteries to Turkey to go along with the F–35 fighters that I guess they can use to bomb the sov-ereign nation of Iraq like they did last week in U.S. F–16s, perhaps this time more effectively. This is insanity. And I am not anti-this administra-tion. I am not anti-this President. I am anti-foolish policy that will cost human lives that will be perpetuated and exacerbated by foolish foreign pol-icy which preceded it. I am not suggesting we attack any-body. I am suggesting we don’t turn and walk away. People who depended upon us and took us at our word are going to die, and we are worried about what we get for Christmas. I mean, I don’t have words. So, Mr. Speaker, I don’t know what more I can do. But I will not stop. With great power comes great re-sponsibility. Contrary to what some people might say, we live in a great Na-tion. Our policy sucks. And to walk away from commitments that we made because it is politically convenient is beyond shameful. This matters. Iran is giddy. Erdogan is giddy. The Russians have punked us, to use the jargon of the day. And the band played on. I don’t know. Somebody wake me up. I am having a nightmare. I mean, I rep-resent the citizens of the Fifth District of Virginia, and I love them. I love my district. But I value human life, and I believe that if we make commitments, we should keep them. And if human life is lost because we can’t keep our word, we need to take a long, hard look at ex-actly who we are. Mr. Speaker, with that, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. G
OHMERT ). Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I just want to applaud my friend’s efforts on behalf of people who have counted on us. The 2 weeks he spent over there have been invaluable to the people who were counting on us. Some of that time was spent with a dear friend named Dave Eubanks. Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. G
ROTHMAN ). Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, I will just take a minute of your time to fol-low up on what Congressman G
ARRETT  just said. It seems to me, in my life-time—I am not an expert on foreign af-fairs—there are good things the United States has done, and bad things. But the worst things are, when people who are counting on us, people who we set up and relied on us, we decide to leave them to whatever will happen. I think, in particular, a much bigger thing is when we stopped funding peo-ple in Vietnam. Obviously, during the Obama administration leaving Iraq, we left all sorts of people who were our friends, and created a huge vacuum. I am just very afraid today, and I would encourage President Trump to recon-sider the decision to withdraw what troops we do have in the Syrian area because we have a lot of allies who felt they could count on the United States, whom I am afraid now will be left to whatever other forces in the region— who are not friendly to Western val-ues—left to whatever they want to do with them. And I hope that is being taken into account right now. Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maine (Mr. POLIQUIN ). Mr. POLIQUIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. G
ARRETT for the opportunity to ad-dress the House. Mr. Speaker, it is the responsibility of the United States House of Rep-resentatives, this body, and also the United States Senate, to protect our families. There is nothing more impor-tant as dictated by the United States Constitution, than to protect our fami-lies. Mr. Speaker, we have one heck of a problem on our southwest border with Mexico: in California, New Mexico, and Arizona. We have a very dangerous and very unhealthy situation just on the other side of the fence, in particular now, with Mexico. I am asking the President tonight, if he is watching, to please, publicly ask the House Repub-licans, while we are still in the major-ity, please ask us to pass a real strong border security and immigration bill. We did this several months ago. Goodlatte-McCaul One, as they called it, got 193 votes. It has everything that the President wanted, his four pillars and a heck of a lot more. Why in the world do we want to negotiate for pea-nuts when we can have the whole ball of wax? Goodlatte-McCaul One, has $25 bil-lion, Mr. Trump, $25 billion for border security, including the wall where nec-essary; $25 billion—not $5 billion—$25 billion over 5 years. It ends the visa lottery. It reins in chain migration, and it reforms the asylum process. It is more than the President wants. This will happen, Mr. Speaker, only if the President of the United States pub-licly asks House Republicans to pass this bill or something really close to it. The votes are there. Over the past 2 weeks, I have talked to every single member of the Republican Conference, 235 Members of the House. I have spo-ken to every single one, except for about five or six. We have the votes to do this. It is not too late, but it is get-ting late. After the Democrats take control of this body, they have told us what they will bring or try to bring to the Presi-dent’s desk. It will not be what the President wants. It will not be what America wants. It will be some form of open border, sanctuary cities, and amnesty. There is no better deal. There is no longer an opportunity to hold out for a better deal. We have the votes to pass Good-latte-McCaul One or something real close to it. But I ask the President, he must pub-licly ask the House to do it. That will give enough of our Members the sup-port they need to vote for it, and it will cause leadership to act. Again, why would we want to nego-tiate for peanuts when we can get the

whole ball of wax? I appreciate and I thank Mr. G
ARRETT very much for yielding to me. Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. G
OH-
MERT ). Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, how much time is remaining? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-tleman from Virginia has 8
1⁄2minutes remaining. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend, T
OMGARRETT , for arranging this Special Order. He is on his way out, and he cares so deeply about this country and this country’s allies that he would put his life at risk and go and spend time with another American hero. In fact, Dave Eubanks is a hero, and he is someone who has dedicated his life as a Christian, as an American, trying to make the lives of others in the world better, and I thank my friend, Congressman G
ARRETT , for spending that time with him. We shouldn’t turn our back on our friends. Sometimes it seems that Mr. Erdogan is not our friend, but we cer-tainly have had a tremendous amount of friendship and lives lost in the Kurd-ish community, standing up for us, with us, in defense of freedom. That is important. And I also want to address the issue of the wall on our southern border. It appears clear, since we lost over 70,000 American lives last year—that is more than all of the pre-cious American lives we lost in the whole time of the Vietnam war—and we lost those in 1 year from drugs. Most of those drugs coming across our southern border in the form of opi-ates and other hallucinogens, including fentanyl, are coming from Mexico. So if you want to see another 70,000 Amer-icans die again next year, you don’t want a wall. Let’s not build a wall. If you would like to have illegal aliens continue to pour into this coun-try in the hopes that they will be able to vote illegally, you don’t want a wall, even though you supported one in the past. You don’t want one now because you may get those votes if you can stop a wall from being built. If you want Mexico to remain as a country with so much incredible poten-tial whose people are suffering and keep the people of Central America suf-fering at the hands of the drug cartels, you don’t want a wall. Because if we build a wall where we need it, we build a fence where we need it, we totally se-cure the border, what happens? The money, by the tens of billions, pouring into the drug cartels south of the bor-der dries up. That means the corruption in Mexico and south of there dries up. That means Mexico, with its incredible na-tional resources—the natural resources of that Nation are incredible. Its loca-tion, actually, for commerce is even better than the United States. b2145 It sits between two continents. It sits between two oceans. Its potential is unlimited. But what limits it is the corruption from the drug cartels that America is continuing to fund. So do you want that to continue? Yeah, you don’t want a wall. Our elected leaders in the House and the Senate—the Republican elected leaders in the House and Senate—were not in favor of a wall or total border security in the last election in 2016. It was unfortunate. The President knew and heard the voice of the American people, and he echoed it. But that is why back in Sep-tember of this year at our conference— and I know it wasn’t popular and peo-ple didn’t like me saying it—but I had to make clear, it was clear to me, if we don’t get money for a wall, then the people, the voters that put President Trump in the White House will not come out in the same numbers, and we will not likely remain in the majority. I said it 2 weeks in a row, and the re-sponse was to cancel that last week of votes before the election. We didn’t fund the wall. We said: Oh, let’s wait until December. My comment then was: This will be my 14th December in Congress, and I have lived through 13 where we were told we will fight in December. We have yet to fight in December. Now is the time. I know people want to go home. I want to go home. But this is our chance to protect America for our future. Let’s help the President keep our promise. Let’s help him keep our promise. I know the Speaker and the majority leader were not big on this 2 years ago, but most of America heard commer-cials from our majority leaders saying: Help K
EVIN MCCARTHY and President Trump build the wall. Well, now we need Americans to help remind our Republican leaders to help our President build the wall like we said. If that doesn’t happen, I don’t think the Senate can count on being back in the majority. They won’t be. It is that serious. I have heard that the feeling in the Senate among Republicans now is, let’s not do reconciliation so we only have to pass the money for a wall with 51 votes. We don’t want to do that. If you don’t do that, get money passed for the wall, then you are not coming back in the majority. Maybe you would enjoy the minority. Get used to it. That is where you are head-ing in 2 years. It doesn’t have to be that way. We can still have the White House in 2020. We can still have a majority in the Senate in 2020. We can get the majority back in the House in 2020. But if we drop the ball on this biggest campaign promise, then we are not going to have the majority in either the House or the White House. And that, to quote my friend from Houston, my fellow former judge, that is just the way it is. Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, very quickly back to Syria, if anyone tells you that this is Turks versus Kurds, they should tell Sheikh Bandar, the leader of thousands of Arabs who fight alongside the Kurds and the SDF. If anyone tells you it is Turks versus Kurds, they should tell that to Com-mander Johannes, the leader of thou-sands of Christians who fight alongside Arabs and Kurds. This is not a Kurdish experiment; it is a human experiment. It is an experi-ment in democracy. We made a com-mitment. We should keep our word. Mr. Speaker, if anyone is watching, I hope they will contact their political leaders and ask them to stop the sale of Patriot missiles and F–35s to the ag-gressive Turks. I hope they will know the Iranian military is on the ground in Syria right now everywhere in the form of the IRGC, except the place that we are about to abandon. Mr. Speaker, I thank the men and women across the world who stand up for the basic idea that all people are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights, and among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happi-ness. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. f

SENATE AGENDA Mr. M
CCONNELL. First, for the in-formation of all of our colleagues, later this morning I will introduce a con-tinuing resolution that will ensure con-tinuous funding to the Federal Govern-ment. The measure will provide the re-sources necessary to continue normal operations through February 8. Let’s review why this step was nec-essary. Even in the face of a great need to se-cure the border and following good- faith efforts by the President’s team, our Democratic colleagues rejected an extremely reasonable offer yesterday. It would have cleared the remaining appropriation bills, which had received bipartisan support in committee, and provided an additional $1 billion to tackle a variety of urgent border secu-rity priorities. I am sorry that my Democratic col-leagues couldn’t put their partisanship aside and show the same good faith and flexibility that the President has shown in order to provide the resources our Nation needs to secure the integ-rity of our borders as well as the safety of American families, but this seems to be the reality of our political moment. It seems like political spite, for the President may be winning out over sen-sible policy—even sensible policies that are more modest than border security allocations that many Democrats themselves have supported in the very recent past. Faced with this intransigence—with Democrats’ failure to take our borders seriously—Republicans will continue to fulfill our duty to govern. That is why we will soon take up a simple measure that will continue government funding into February, so that we can continue this vital debate after the new Con-gress has convened, because—make no mistake—there will be important un-finished business in front of us, and we owe it to the American people to fi-nally tackle it. Just last week, U.S. Customs and Border Commissioner Kevin McAleenan told our colleagues on the Judiciary Committee that the United States faces a border security and hu-manitarian crisis—a border security and humanitarian crisis. These are some of the facts. In the past year alone, we saw a 30-percent in-crease in apprehensions by CBP, in-cluding nearly 6,700 apprehensions of individuals with criminal histories and a 50-percent increase in apprehensions of known gang members. We have seen a 75-percent spike in methamphet-amine seizures since fiscal 2015. So it is quite obvious that shoring up our bor-ders is an urgent need for our national security—no question about it. Secure borders are what the Amer-ican people expect and they deserve. That is why it continues to be a major focus of President Trump and his ad-ministration. Already the President’s approach to border security is yielding undeniable results. In each of four CBP sectors where physical borders have been improved or expanded—El Paso, Yuma, Tucson, and San Diego—illegal traffic has dropped by at least 90 per-cent. While you wouldn’t know it from lis-tening to the far-left special interests, this administration’s focus on border security actually follows similar com-monsense efforts that used to be a bi-partisan consensus. It used to be a bipartisan consensus. In 2006, for example, the Secure Fence Act, which is designed to strengthen physical security measures at the bor-der, received the support of no fewer than 26 of our Democratic colleagues, including the current Democratic lead-er, along with Senators FEINSTEIN , C
ARPER , N ELSON , STABENOW , W YDEN , and Obama. In 2010, President Obama signed a bill to increase the CBP’s physical presence down at the border. It passed the Sen-ate by unanimous consent, by the way. So let’s not pretend there is some bright-line principle that separates the billions of dollars that our Democratic colleagues were willing and eager to spend on border security in the recent

past and the resources now requested by the President and his team. There is no big difference in principle. There has just been a shift in the political winds on the far left. This is knee-jerk, partisan opposition to the administra-tion’s reasonable and flexible requests. This is making political obstruction a higher goal than the integrity of our Nation’s borders. Frankly, it is just po-litical spite, and the American people know it when they see it. So the Senate will continue our work on the remaining bills—the products of much bipartisan hard work and col-laboration, and, in the meantime, we will turn to a clean continuing resolu-tion later today so we can make sure we don’t end this year the way we began it—with another government shutdown because of the Democrats’ al-lergy to sensible immigration policies. That is what they did at the beginning of the year. We need the government to remain open for the American people. We need to wrap up our work for this year, and I hope that my Democratic friends re-turn next year ready to join the Presi-dent, this Senate majority, and the American people in our desire to secure our border.

TRIBUTE TO PAUL RYAN Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, on a completely different matter, from time to time, each of us has indulged in jokes and finger-pointing that sustain the friendly rivalry between the House and the Senate—the Founders’ meta-phorical teacup and saucer. Make no mistake. I am thankful every day that so many former Representatives see the light and come over to join us in the Upper Chamber, but for the past 3 years, there is no one outside of the Senate with whom I have partnered more closely than the Speaker of the House, P
AULRYAN. As history will remember, the speak-ership was far from the destination that the contented Ways and Means chairman had in mind when our friend John Boehner announced his retire-ment in 2015, but to the great fortune of the entire Republican Party, P
AUL had demonstrated over his years in the House the very qualities his conference needed most. Everyone knew he had uncompro-mising integrity, seemingly inexhaust-ible energy, the trust and admiration of his fellow Members, and he had an aspirational message about what we stood for as Republicans. He has re-minded our party, as clearly and force-fully as any leader of his generation, about all that our party can and should aspire to be—‘‘not pale pastels,’’ in Ronald Reagan’s timeless words, ‘‘but bold colors.’’ His colleagues knew he had all of these qualities, and we knew it here in the Senate. While I was far from the most crucial member of the pressure campaign—a draft effort that even roped in the Car-dinal Archbishop of New York—I will admit that I picked up the phone too. I called PAUL and told him exactly what he didn’t want to hear—that he was the right man at the right mo-ment. Conveniently, I was about to get on a plane to Iraq at the time. So P
AUL didn’t have much of an opportunity to push back. Over the past 3 years, I have had more opportunities than most to see the right man in action. We have met weekly to coordinate the efforts of our majorities and present a united front on behalf of the American people. At times the cohesion between our teams made it feel like we shared one large staff. So I have seen firsthand how much of what we have been able to ac-complish this Congress has been due in huge part to P
AUL’s serious approach and to his principles and his prag-matism alike. He helped lead the way on last year’s comprehensive reform of our Tax Code, turning his decades-long personal mis-sion into a brighter future for millions of American workers and job creators. He navigated tense funding negotia-tions with a deep understanding of his Members’ concerns and stood firm in support of America’s military, helping to deliver the largest year-on-year in-crease in defense funding in 15 years. He stayed true to his heart, putting Catholic social teaching into practice and fighting for policies of all shapes and sizes to lift up the most vulnerable among us, from the working poor to the victims of human trafficking. His tenure as Speaker has proved a perfect capstone to a remarkable ca-reer in Congress. Every step of the way, P
AUL has shattered myths and stereotypes about what conservative leaders are like. Through his long list of accomplish-ments and his personal witness alike, he has demonstrated that faith in American free enterprise and indi-vidual liberty are not quaint, outdated ideas but essential and timeless prin-ciples. He has helped prove that right-of- center values are not only the basis for protest movements, as some cynics had liked to suggest, they are also the foundation for governing majorities. He has shown that our party’s ideals and principles do not clash whatsoever with the moral priority we should place on those at the margins of soci-ety but rather that those ideas are often the best means to honor that commitment. Talk about a product of the Jack Kemp coaching tree. It is safe to say the Speaker’s cherished mentor would be mighty proud. P
AUL’Stime at the center stage of our Nation’s politics has inspired countless Americans, in-cluding a new generation of leaders, but speaking personally, more than any one of the accomplishments that I have been proud to work with P
AULto help to secure, I think I will most re-member how he has done that job; how energetically and happily the Speaker has poured himself into each task at hand. No matter if some said it couldn’t be done, no matter that he hadn’t sought the job in the first place, the happy warrior has been undeterred. For all this says about PAUL RYAN the Speaker, it says even more about P
AULRYANthe man. He has a big heart and a razor-sharp mind. It doesn’t take long to notice either one, and he knows how to lead with both. He is a man of profound faith and abiding patriotism, and even after 20 years of Washington, he remains a staunch optimist. P
AULis quick to in-sist that America’s brightest days are yet to come and even quicker to back up the sentiment with action. Working with Speaker R
YANhas been among the great joys of my career in the Senate. The Nation is so much bet-ter for his leadership, and I am better for his friendship. I am so grateful to P
AUL for everything. I wish him, Janna, and their lovely family great happiness in whatever adventures lie ahead.

TRIBUTE TO JOHN CORNYN Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, now I am down to my very last end-of-year tribute to a Member of this body. I offer this one with the very greatest re-luctance. This one isn’t occasioned by any re-tirement. Fortunately, for all of us, Senator J
OHNCORNYN isn’t going any-where. He will be right here with us when the 116th Congress convenes in January, but he will no longer be serv-ing as Republican whip. His tenure in this key leadership role is almost com-plete. So I could not let the week pass without sharing for the official Record—and with all of our col-leagues—a small slice of the tremen-dous gratitude and respect and admira-tion I feel for the senior Senator from Texas. J
OHN and I were already well ac-quainted when he took over the whip role 6 years ago in relief of J
ONKYL, but still, I wasn’t sure exactly what our relationship would look like. You never quite know in advance. Every-body is different, but just a few weeks into our partnership as leader and whip, J
OHNpresented me with a birth-day gift that told me at least three things about him. He framed and autographed a picture of ourselves—just an ordinary, not par-ticularly glamorous shot of the two of us, plus J
OHNBARRASSO , probably talk-ing with the press there in the Ohio Clock corridor. A somewhat unusual gift, I thought. Lesson No. 1: This guy has a sense of humor and good cheer. In this photo, I am kind of standing front and center. Six-foot-one J
OHNis standing right be-hind me, a little out of focus and half-way in the shadow. So there is lesson No. 2: Humility. Then there was his handwritten mes-sage: ‘‘Happy birthday, Mitch—I’ve got your back.’’ That was lesson No. 3. It spoke for itself and how fortunate I

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S7825 December 19, 2018 
have been to be reminded every single day since that J
OHNCORNYN meant ex-actly what he said. J
OHN has proven to be a stunningly effective whip for the Republican con-ference these past years. He has also been more than a solid friend and a wiser, more loyal counselor than I had any right to expect. The whip is a powerful position. The conference trusts you to help lead them. Your peers trust you with your candor and their concerns. As each piece of legislation progresses, dif-ferent groups of your colleagues are trusting you to help secure accomplish-ments that are huge priorities for them and their own constituents. So it is easy to imagine ways this critical role could go off the rails. You could wear out your welcome with some of your colleagues. You could be-come too focused on notching today’s win at the expense of tomorrow’s rela-tionships and good feelings. You could let personal disagreements threaten the unity of your leadership team and your conference, but as those who know him well can attest, these aren’t worries that keep John up at night. That is because he is the quintessential team player, not focused on personal gain, dedicated to the causes that mat-ter to Texas and his Members, and will-ing to roll up his sleeves and do the hefty lifting himself to advance those goals. You know, they say everything is bigger in Texas, and sure enough, ‘‘Big John’’ has been known to ride across the screen in campaign spots from time to time, but somewhere along the way, J
OHN’Sego didn’t get the message. J
OHNdoesn’t twist arms or get angry. He doesn’t playact at being the bad cop. Instead, he listens. He learns. He pours his time and energy into learning all about his colleagues, their con-cerns, their State’s priorities. People outside the Senate might think someone in J
OHN’Sposition would need to act like a bully. The term ‘‘whip’’ certainly sends that mes-sage, but J
OHN knows that scare tac-tics don’t do many favors in the long run. The winning strategy on Team Cornyn has been less like the Mafia and more like savvy and heartfelt cus-tomer service, and they sure have a lot to show for it. The more I have been re-flecting on why J
OHNhas had so much success, I have kept coming back to the fact that this man was a judge—a Texas Supreme Court justice, to be exact. In a courtroom, the judge has the power, but their job isn’t to whee-dle or persuade. It is to listen fairly to all parties, all theories, and all ideas. Give everyone a hearing, take it all in, and then chart the best course possible. How lucky we have all been to have somebody like that whipping votes for the last 6 years. It is a privilege to see J
OHNat work. It has been an honor to work in the trenches with him day after day these past 6 years. To be more accurate, it has been a pleasure to stand shoulder to shoulder with him here in the well. We have had our fair share of quality time. At the end of any Congress, you would expect the majority leader and whip might have a small handful of close shaves and dramatic moments to reflect on, but JOHN has helped steer the ship with the slimmest possible majorities. Week after week, 51 to 49, then 50 to 49, in many cases. We have seen this play out in the confirmation of a historic number of well-qualified nominees to the Federal judiciary and in the passage of major legislation of delicate moving parts, from comprehensive tax reform to a landmark opioids package. The truth is, even a comprehensive catalog of all the big floor votes would only capture a fraction of J
OHN’Sexcel-lent work. More key nominees and im-portant pieces of legislation have trav-eled quietly through the Senate be-cause J
OHNhas been there, diligent and patient and respectful, working through challenges and addressing con-cerns, literally, around the clock. As if this wasn’t enough to fill J
OHN’S plate, let’s remember, while serving as whip, he has also been a vital member of the Intelligence Committee, Judici-ary Committee, and the Finance Com-mittee, and he has been an outstanding senior Senator for Texas all at the same time. In fact, in each of the past two Con-gresses, no Senator has been the lead sponsor of more bills that have become law than J
OHNCORNYN . He led on Fix NICS. He led the fight against human trafficking—all in a couple of years’ work. Of course, he doesn’t do it alone. J
OHN has assembled a whip staff that are as much a testament to his eye for talent as they are a tremendous asset for the entire conference. At the helm of the operation as chief of staff in his whip office, Monica Popp. In so many ways, J
OHN and Monica seem to be cut from the same cloth. Like her boss, Monica has a sixth sense when it comes to reading a room and getting people what they need. She rel-ishes the chance to tackle tough prob-lems. As far as she is concerned, a trou-blesome situation is really just an op-portunity. Just like J
OHN, Monica is an attentive listener. This has made her an encyclopedic authority on what makes each Member of the conference tick. When Monica makes a rec-ommendation, you know it is based on the best possible information, and on so many occasions, I have relied di-rectly on her sharp counsel out here on the floor. I am not sure I have ever worked with someone who had such a warm heart and ice in her veins at the very same time. She operates with calm and confidence precisely because she has built so many genuine and solid friend-ships that she knows just where things stand. Outside observers get Congress wrong when they say, ‘‘It’s all about the math.’’ It is really all about the rela-tionships. Ironically enough, this former math teacher turned all-star Hill staffer is just about the ultimate living proof of that. We may not be losing Senator COR-
NYNthis month, but I am sorry to say we are saying goodbye to Monica. I will miss her, and I know the entire con-ference will miss her. It is all about relationships with J
OHN too. Even as he was constantly tasked with walking a tightrope through a pressure cooker, he has also managed to be one of the kindest, most down-to-earth human beings around. In no place is this more evident than the way he treats the unelected members of this Senate family. He gets to know everyone. He wants to earn your trust. He wants to know how you are doing. After all, before he was the Senate’s majority whip or a justice on the Texas Supreme Court or the State’s attorney general, he was a husband and father. I know his wife, Sandy, and their family are hoping the end of J
OHN’Sservice as whip will bring at least a nominal re-laxing of his schedule. I doubt that, by the way. Ordinarily, I might guess that J
OHN might be able to spend more time on his hobbies, but somehow—as his pro-lific Twitter and Instagram pages regu-larly notify the whole world—he has kept right at them all along. For all the different hats J
OHNwears in the Senate, he has managed to hang on to his chef’s cap too—marching through the ‘‘Rasika’’ cookbook and whipping up feasts for the family. The dove hunts certainly haven’t gone any-where either. So, really, whatever his title happens to say, what I am looking forward to from J
OHNis more of the same—more invaluable guidance, more exemplary legislating. I know the press corps is certainly hoping for more of his in-formative one-liners. Like I said, I am so happy we aren’t saying goodbye to J
OHNtoday. What I am saying—with complete personal sincerity, and also for the entire con-ference—is thank you. Thank you for your friendship, partnership, and thank you for making all of us look better than any of us deserve. Thank you for helping the Senate deliver for the country. Thank you for always having all of our backs. Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the conclu-sion of the remarks by the ranking member, that I be recognized.

GOVERNMENT FUNDING Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, we have a short time left before appropria-tions expire on Friday. Yesterday, we made some progress. Thankfully, President Trump appears to have backed down from his position for billions in direct appropriations for a border wall. For the past several weeks, the President’s insistence on $5 billion for a wall has been the biggest obstacle to keeping the government open past Friday. The President’s spokesperson has claimed that the administration can build the full wall from reprogrammed funds given to other areas of the gov-ernment. Let me be very clear. With-out our assent, the administration can-not reprogram funds proposed by Con-gress for the full wall. To do so would violate Congress’s article I powers. They cannot do it on their own, and the House and Senate will not approve a wall from reprogrammed funds or anything else. It will not happen. We Democrats have opposed massive appropriations for a border wall for five reasons. It is not effective compared to other border security measures. Expert after expert has said that. There is no plan to build it. The President asked for $5 billion, but there are no plans of where the wall would be, how much it would cost, what each part would be made of. There is no plan to deal with eminent domain. There are lots of peo-ple on the Texas border and on other borders who don’t want to give up their land. They have said they will fight it in court. It will take years. We have not heard a peep out of the administra-tion on how to deal with that. Above all, the President promised that Mex-ico would pay for it, not the American taxpayer. Was it a campaign issue? Yes. Yet, throughout, the President said Mexico would pay for it. He never campaigned on having Americans pay for a massive border wall, ineffective as it would be. The Democrats have been perfectly clear. We want smart, effective border security, but that is not a wall. The President and, just this morning, the Republican leader have suggested re-peatedly that Democrats are against all border security. Of course, we are not. Every expert has looked at that and said it is a total lie. Frankly, the reason our colleagues, the President, Leader MCCONNELL , and others do it is that they have no defense of the wall. Instead of defending the wall, they say the Democrats are not for border secu-rity. Nothing could be further from the truth, as shown by what we have sup-ported in the past and today. This morning, the President also tweeted that Mexico could somehow pay for the wall through a new trade deal. This is a huge turnaround for a President who once insisted: Mark my words. Mexico will pay for the wall 100 percent. Of course, there have been multiple fact checks to show a new NAFTA could not possibly fund the wall directly or indirectly. There is nothing in the new agreement that stipulates Mexico must devote any re-sources to the United States, and any savings from a trade deal, if there are any savings, don’t go to the Treasury; they go to American businesses and American taxpayers. Ultimately, the President would have to tax the Amer-ican people to fund his wall. Mexico ain’t footing the bill. All that said, it is good news that the President has retreated from his de-mand that Congress fund the wall. Now, we Democrats in the Senate and in the House have made two reasonable

offers that, I believe, would glide through the House and Senate: No. 1, pass the six bipartisan appropriations bills and a 1-year CR for DHS or, No. 2, pass a 1-year CR for all seven remain-ing appropriations bills. Leader M
CCONNELL proposed a short- term CR just a few minutes ago. We would have preferred one of our two op-tions, but I am glad the leader thinks the government should not shut down over the President’s demand for a wall, and the Democrats will support this CR. The President and the House should follow that lead because shut-ting down the government over Christ-mas is a terrible idea—one of the worst to come down the pike in a very long time. 
f 
FIRST STEP ACT Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, on the CJR, criminal justice reform, I am really deeply heartfelt in thanking ev-eryone who was involved in the crimi-nal justice reform legislation. I thank Senator D
URBIN , for whom this issue was a year’s-long passion. When Senator D
URBIN gets his teeth into an issue, he does not let go until he achieves it, and he is great at get-ting it done. It was a real victory for him. Senator B
OOKER felt this issue so pas-sionately from his residents in Newark and in seeing what had happened to friends of his and people he had known. He was a brilliant legislative tactician in knowing just how far to push and in getting the most he could from a Con-gress that was not from our side of the aisle. Senator W
HITEHOUSE carried the mantle of making sure that while peo-ple are in prison, they are given ade-quate preparation so when they come out, they don’t become recidivists again—free from drugs, with job train-ing—and so they can become useful and productive members of society. Senator H
ARRIS also added her pas-sion and experience as attorney general to the great arguments for this bill. I don’t want to leave out colleagues on the other side of the aisle. Senator G
RASSLEY played a real role as a statesman. Senator L
EEdid tremen-dous work on this bill. Again, like with Senator B
OOKER but from an opposite point of view, he knew when to hold and knew when to fold. I thank all of them because this bill will make an extraordinary difference in countless lives by making our sen-tencing laws fairer and smarter, by giv-ing judges more discretion so low-level, nonviolent drug offenses will not al-ways be subject to arbitrary manda-tory minimums; by giving prisoners with good behavior and who work hard to rehabilitate themselves better op-portunities to prepare for their inte-gration back into society as productive citizens who can contribute to their communities; and by ending the most abusive practices of our criminal jus-tice system, like juvenile solitary con-finement and the shackling of pregnant prisoners. The bill got 87 votes. Those 87 votes are an entreaty to the new Congress to do more. It is called FIRST STEP for a lot of reasons, one being that many of us feel we have to go further and do more. Next year, hopefully, we can, and the resounding support from both sides of the aisle that this bill got should help us. It should importune us not to let this be the last proposal but the first in this area. The law will bring more justice to our justice system. I was proud to vote for it and so grateful for the work of my colleagues who pulled a diverse coalition together to get it across the line. f 
CHINA Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, on China, negotiations are ongoing be-tween the Trump administration and Chinese officials about a potential de-tente in our trading relationship. Of import to the Chinese is the recent ar-rest of Huawei’s CFO on charges of vio-lating U.S. sanctions law, which is only one area of concern when it comes to Huawei’s technology. Let me be very clear. The United States should not make any—any— concessions until and unless China makes credible and enforceable com-mitments to end all forms of theft and extortion of American intellectual property. As Ambassador Lighthizer recently pointed out—and I cannot commend him enough for the good job he is doing—during the Obama administra-tion alone, China made no fewer than 10 independent commitments to get rid of forced technology transfers and cyber theft policies. As we know, China cyber espionage continues unabated. Just last week, it was confirmed that China was behind the data breach of Marriott hotels, and we know that they continue to require any company that sells things—and there are so many companies that sell things in China—to transfer their tech-nology. If we continue on this path that we have for the last 10 or 15 years, we will no longer be the leading economy in the world. All the great ideas Ameri-cans have because of our free and open and entrepreneurial system will be sto-len, purloined, and China will domi-nate. We are there for fair competition. China doesn’t compete fairly. I have to say, neither the Bush nor the Obama administration stood up strongly to China. This administration shows signs of doing it. My message to President Trump: Don’t back off. Follow Mr. Lighthizer, not those in your administration, as reported, the Senate, Mr. Mnuchin, Mr. Ross, and others, who want to settle for next to nothing. That would be a disgrace. President Trump has tried the concil-iatory approach. He let ZTE off the hook in hopes of gaining concessions from China on North Korea and got none. North Korea continues to expand its nuclear capabilities. Mr. President, do not make the same mistake again by interfering in the case of Huawei’s CFO. Mr. President, do not capitulate on U.S. trade policy without meaningful, ironclad commit-ments from China to end its predatory trade practices, its theft of our intel-lectual property, and until China al-lows U.S. companies to compete freely in its markets without technology transfer or other coercions. To do oth-erwise would put the future of this great Nation at great risk. f 
TRIBUTE TO BILL NELSON Mr. SCHUMER. Finally, Mr. Presi-dent, I have come here to speak about a dear friend and a wonderful col-league, the senior Senator from Flor-ida, B
ILLNELSON . A Floridian born and bred, B
ILLNEL-
SONdidn’t grow up with a silver spoon in his mouth. Everything he has achieved in life, he achieved because he worked for it. Hard work is one of his credos. In high school, B
ILLraised cattle in his spare time. That is not every teen-ager’s idea of a good time, and that is something we never did in Brooklyn, but it led to a lifetime association with Florida’s 4–H Program, which con-tinues to support Florida’s agricultural community today. Just as important, B
ILL’s extra-curricular animal husbandry allowed him to save up the $10,000 he needed to attend college at the University of Florida. Even then, public service was never far from this generous man’s thoughts. He gave his first political speech as a candidate for junior high school president—a race he won. In col-lege, he interned for Florida’s Senator George Smathers, whose son Bruce happened to be his roommate. That internship turned out to be the lesser contribution of B
ILL’s friendship with Bruce because a few years after law school, Bruce would introduce Bill to Grace Cavert, who became Grace Nelson, the love of B
ILL’s life. For those of us who know B
ILL, we know he loves Grace more than any-thing in the world. They are truly a dream team. Just to watch them to-gether, caring about each other so, brings joy to anyone’s heart—certainly mine. Many of my colleagues, of course, know Grace as well and have worked closely with her, not the least reason being that she is the authority in that household today. With Grace by his side, Senator N
EL-
SONembarked on what would be a dis-tinguished career in public service in Florida as Congressman, tax commis-sioner, and eventually Senator. Of course, along the way, Senator N
ELSON  would also earn the title of ‘‘payload specialist’’ abroad the Space Shuttle Columbia. As most folks know, then- Congressman Nelson, who was chair of

the House Science, Space, and Tech-nology Committee, participated in a weeklong space flight on the Columbia. What most folks don’t know, however, is that the launch for the mission was aborted not once, not twice, but three times. Eventually, though, the liftoff was achieved, and B
ILLbecame only the second sitting Member of Congress to leave Earth’s atmosphere, where, in his words, he saw ‘‘the blue brilliance of the earth from the edge of the heav-ens.’’ There is a name given to the shift in perspective experienced by astronauts called the overview effect. Seeing the Earth from the window of a space shut-tle—that pale-blue marble in the vast emptiness of space—makes you realize how fragile and also how beautiful our planet truly is. Senator N
ELSON experi-enced something of an overview effect, and although he already cared about the environment, he became a lifelong champion of environmental causes. B
ILLNELSON protected and preserved the Everglades, Florida’s beaches, and offshore waters by standing against off-shore drilling. There is none in Florida, and I have to a say that the reason is sitting right to my left—B
ILLNELSON . Time and again, when rapacious com-panies and others wanted to drill and risk the beauty of Florida’s coastline and its economic vitality, there was B
ILL NELSON , like Horatio at the bridge, preventing it from happening. After the BP oilspill, B
ILL NELSON  made sure Florida’s gulf communities got the restitution they deserved from BP’s settlement. Senator N
ELSON has always been a loud voice speaking about the need for action on climate change, as his be-loved State of Florida gets hit by ever more powerful storms and the low- lying areas, like Miami, get flooded regularly. Of course, seeing the Earth from space didn’t just focus B
ILL’s eyes downward. This man is capable of doing many things at once. He kept them firmly fixed on the horizons as well. It will be a long time before the Senate sees a champion for NASA and space exploration like B
ILLNELSON . It may never see one as committed again. The Senate, the State of Florida, and the country will miss B
ILLNELSON , as will Iris and I. He was even-tempered even in tempestuous times. He was al-ways civil in the midst of such incivil-ity. When so many of us are prone to looking backward, trying to figure out what we did wrong or what we could have done differently, B
ILLwas always looking forward and upward. I have had the pleasure not only of being B
ILL’s colleague but being his friend. What a fine human being. One of my greatest regrets here is that some fine human beings are not going to be with us next time, and this Chamber and this country will show they are missed. There is nothing B
ILLis now looking forward to more than spending time with his beloved Grace and visiting his children, Bill Junior and Nan Ellen. Every one of us salutes the great sen-ior Senator from Florida, everything he has accomplished in his distin-guished career in the Senate, and just the great man that he is. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Oklahoma. f

TRIBUTE TO JOHN CORNYN  
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I have a message to deliver this morning, but after sitting here and listening through and enjoying the comments that were made, I wanted to at least make one comment about the Senator from Texas. In my real life, for a number of years, I was a builder and developer in South Texas. I know South Texas very well. I know the border well. That is why I have been down there so much and am so interested in, of course, the border wall, which we are going to have. But we have a wonderful friend and a per-son who has been a good friend. You would think he is dead, but he is not. He is very much alive, and he is back doing his full-time job. I want to say that the time I spent with him down there in Texas long be-fore he was even in the position he is in today—he has been a great hero down there not just to the people in Texas but people all over the country. BORDER SECURITY  
Mr. President, as far as the com-ments that were made by the minority leader from New York, it is easy to stand here and talk about this. Yes, I know the Democrats—they have all gotten together, and they don’t want to have a wall, but they are going to have a wall. Walls work. Look at the record of having walls. San Diego built their wall in 1992, and illegal traffic dropped 92 percent after that. Ninety-two percent. El Paso built their wall—I remember when that was built—in 1993, and illegal traffic dropped 72 percent. Tucson built their wall in 2000, and illegal traffic dropped 90 percent. Yuma, in Arizona, built theirs in 2005, and illegal traffic dropped. It has happened everywhere. Just look at Israel and the successes they have had and how many Israelis would be dead today if it weren’t for the wall they have. We are one of the few countries with-out a wall. We are going to have a wall, and it is going to be funded. So if any-one is listening to what is going on down here, just be assured that we are going to have our wall. 
REMEMBERING GEORGE H .W. BUSH  
Mr. President, I want to make one comment on something that happened 3 or 4 weeks ago, when we lost an American hero. Everyone talked about George H.W. Bush, and they talked about their experiences. The reason I wanted to wait a while before making any comments on that is because I have known George H.W. Bush for many, many years, before I was actu-ally in politics. My wife Kay and I are praying for the entire Bush family as the Nation mourns and honors one of America’s loyal sons. George H.W. Bush was one of the only men I have ever known who could truly love someone into changing his mind. He loved God. He loved his family. He loved his country and served it tire-lessly with passion. Listen to all of the things he has done. He was a naval aviator, an Am-bassador, Director of the CIA, Presi-dent of the United States, and Vice President of the United States. He has done it all. George H.W. Bush put service to his Nation and love for his family above all else. Kay and I have known the Bush family for a long time, dating back to their time in the Texas oil fields. He would go back and forth to what he re-ferred to as his second home, which is Tulsa, OK. We were friends before we were in politics, and I am grateful for that friendship. I will always remember that friendship. This portrays him very well. Back when I was mayor of Tulsa and George Bush was Vice President, he came to Tulsa, OK, to do a fundraising event. It

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES7830 December 19, 2018 
was a fundraising event. My wife, in spite of her reputation to the contrary, is a pretty shy person. At these events, she always insists, if we are going to be at the head table, that she be seated next to me at that table. She is not in-secure or any of that stuff, but none-theless this is something she got in her head a long time ago, and she has al-ways wanted that. So on this occasion—this is when George Bush came to Tulsa, OK, to par-ticipate in a fundraiser—she snuck up there and looked at the table and the name tags and looked at me and said: You can’t do that. You are not seated next to me. I have to be seated next to you. I said: Who are you seated next to? She said: George Bush. Well, apparently, one of the security guys or someone went back and told George Bush about that. So he came up behind her—I will always remember— and he put his arm around her and said: I don’t bite. He said further: I will take care of you; don’t worry about a thing. Now, during her conversation up there—she conceded, of course, to sit next to George Bush—he said: You don’t happen to know someone named Marian Bovard, do you? And she said: Well, of course, she is a good friend. He said: I haven’t seen her in a long time. Kay said: Well, she is sitting right over there. You can see her from here. So he sent one of his Secret Service people over there to bring Marian Bovard, an old friend, to visit. It turned out that my wife and George H.W. Bush found out that they both had many mutual friends. Every time he would bring someone up, it happened that that person was there. So he would come over and remind her. She became George Bush’s social direc-tor, I think, for the remainder of the fundraiser. I think she even ate his broccoli for him. Now, before I got to Congress, I was a builder and developer in South Texas for many years. Of course, Bush was from Texas. We knew each other at that time. He came to see me a few times when I was working down there, and, somehow, it always happened to be on days when I was fishing, because I fish every day down there. That is one of the many hobbies I have, and I enjoy doing that. One day he said to me, after he was President: You know, I envy you. This is kind of strange to have the President of the United States say: I envy you. The reason he said that is because he always enjoyed fishing, and he knows I have a whole bunch of kids and grandkids who all like to fish, and he doesn’t. So he envies me. There is a fishing guide, who my old chief of staff, Richard Soudriette—who, incidentally, is one who is very similar to George Bush in that I have never heard him be mad at anyone or dislike anyone or talk in a profane way about anyone, and that is the same as we have heard so many people say about George Bush. So Richard Soudriette, who also likes to go fishing with me, knew this fishing guide. Not many peo-ple are aware of this. Bush had this fishing guide here in Washington, who would sneak in early in the morning, and they would go fishing. His name was Angus. He went to the White House early one morning to go fishing with the President. He was there so early that the Secret Service escorted him up to the residence where he had coffee with the Bushes, who were still in their pajamas. This is a good story. You should read the whole thing. It was in the Wash-ington Post, and it is on my website. But President Bush was restless and sometimes impatient, which are not usually characteristics that make a really good fisherman. But because he was steady and dedicated to the task at hand, he did OK, and he even got a few fish, they told me, on that day. When he was running for President, he came to Tulsa for a fundraising function at the Mayo Hotel. He knew everyone in Tulsa. We did the normal routine we always do. We greeted sup-porters, gave remarks, and then opened it up for questions. I will never forget this. Ellen McGuire, who is a person who is kind of a party regular in the Republican Party, stood up and said: Are you part of the international com-munist conspiracy? George Bush didn’t even blink. He looked over at the organizer and said: Where do you find these nuts? Next question. When he was Vice President, he and Barbara came to Tulsa another time, and I went with a group who was in charge of picking them up at the air-port. I was mayor at that time. So we had a guy on my staff named Charlie Burris, also a security guy. So we thought he would be the perfect person to pick up Barbara and George Bush and take them into town. So we get there, and Charlie goes and picks up the luggage and hands it to the person behind him, thinking it was me, and said: Take this to the hotel. He turned around and saw that in-stead of it being me, it was Barbara Bush. She looked a little stunned, but she took the bags and took them and off she went. The cars that came to pick him up were the cars we always used when we had somebody coming to Tulsa. Why invest in limousines down there? They were funeral home lim-ousines. Vice President Bush took one look at them, looked in the back, which I think still had a wreath that said ‘‘Rest in Peace’’ on it, and said: You must have a cheap mayor. Well, that mayor was me. I told him I pre-ferred the word ‘‘frugal.’’ George Bush knew Oklahoma better than any President in history. Before that date, he was even telling reporters that he wanted this to be his turf, his State. He frequently called Tulsa, OK, his second home. Bush regularly held up Oklahoma as an example of ‘‘points of light,’’ a State that knew how to use public-private partnerships to do all of the right things and thrive and be suc-cessful. These are just a few stories about a man who strived to make every man, every woman, every child whom he met feel valuable in his eyes. George Bush saw life as a series of missions, and he completed those mis-sions with fervor and grace. He never wasted a minute, and for that, I am grateful. As the Nation continues to mourn one of her most loyal sons, let us find solace in the fact that he is holding hands, reunited with Barbara again. President Bush, you are a true Amer-ican hero. Mission complete. God bless you. One more thing, today, December 19, Kay and I are celebrating our 59th wed-ding anniversary. I just want to say: Kay, I still love you. I yield the floor.

DRONE ATTACKS  
Mr. PAUL. Do drone attacks work? Well, you might say: Of course they work; they kill their intended target. But do drone attacks really work? Do drone killings make us safer? Do drone killings bring victory nearer? Do drone killings kill more terrorists than they create? I think these are valid ques-tions and questions that should be de-bated and discussed. There are those who have been in-volved in the drone killings who actu-ally believe that they aren’t helping our country. This is a letter from four American servicemen in the Air Force to President Obama from a year or two ago. It reads: 
We are former Air Force servicemembers who have been involved in the drone pro-gram. We joined the Air Force to protect American lives and to protect our Constitu-tion. We came to the realization, though, that innocent civilians we were killing only fueled the feelings of hatred that ignited ter-rorism in groups like ISIS, while also serving as a fundamental recruitment tool. This administration— 
then, referring to the Obama admin-istration— 
and its predecessors have built a drone pro-gram that is one of the most devastating driving forces for terrorism and destabiliza-tion around the world. 
The question is this: Do drone killings actually kill more terrorists than they create? As the brothers, sisters, and cousins from the village gather around the mangled bodies, do they say, ‘‘Oh, well, I guess we are now going to put down our arms and make peace,’’ or are they excited, are they engendered, are they somehow motivated to become suicide bombers themselves? Do the drone killings simply steal their resolve? Do the drone killings cause surviving members to strap on suicide vests? Is there a limit? Is there an end to how many we will kill with drones?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S7831 December 19, 2018 
The power to kill anyone, anywhere, anytime is an ominous power. I think most of the people involved in the pro-gram, including President Obama, had motives to kill our enemies, to kill those who they thought might come someday and kill us, but the program has become so extensive, and it has ex-tended across so many different coun-tries that there is concern, No. 1, about the civilians—the women and children who are being killed in these strikes as collateral damage—but there is also some concern about whether or not that kind of ominous power—the power to kill anyone, anywhere, anytime in the entire world—is so ominous that there should be checks and balances. In our country, no one is killed with-out not only checks and balances but without the due process of the law. People say: Well, you can’t have due process in far-flung battlefields around the world. Shouldn’t we at least con-sider, though, whether or not there should be checks and balances and whether or not one person can make the decision to kill? I think this is something that should be debated, dis-cussed, and we should have oversight from Congress. You will recall that in Obama’s ad-ministration, the drone attacks really hit a new peak. You will recall that he made his decisions on whom to approve the killing of on ‘‘Terrorism Tues-days.’’ There were reports that flash cards were used in the discussion of who was to be killed. There were also reports that John Brennan had complete authority to kill on his own in certain places. John Brennan also responded and said, when asked about the drone program, that there are no geographical limitations to where we can kill. That is a little bit worrisome, par-ticularly since Congress has never au-thorized war in the seven different countries where President Obama uti-lized drones and where drones continue to be used. People say: Well, this isn’t really war, or this has something to do with 9/11. This has nothing to do with 9/11. None of these people had anything to do with 9/11. People say: There are associated forces. That is not in the 9/11 authorization. Congress voted after 9/11 and said: You can go after those who organized, aided, abetted; those who helped to plan; those who helped the attackers of 9/11. It didn’t say you could go after any far-flung religious radical or ideo-logue throughout the world and kill them, but that is what we do. It is an ominous power to kill anyone, any-where, anytime. I had this debate with the Obama ad-ministration, and I asked them di-rectly: Can you kill an American with a drone? Interestingly, they hesitated to an-swer that question. They finally did say: We are not going to kill an Amer-ican not involved in combat in the United States with a drone. It took 13 hours to get that answer from them. There are questions about what hap-pens to an American accused and put on the kill list. Can we kill an Amer-ican overseas? Often the killings aren’t people marching around with muskets. They aren’t people marching around shoot-ing each other in a war, where it is like you have a war zone and you are drop-ping a bomb on the other side of a war. These are often people sitting in a hut somewhere, eating dinner. These are often people whom we kill where we find them. We often don’t know the names of those who are killed, and we often have no idea in the end who is killed in these attacks. Sometimes we do it just simply be-cause it looks like a bunch of bad peo-ple all lined up. So we have what we call ‘‘signature strikes,’’ where we just kill people whose cars are lined up whom we presume to be bad people. I think their motives are well in-tended, but sometimes we end up kill-ing the wrong people. We killed about 12 people in Yemen in 2013 for which we paid $1 million, saying: Whoops, we got the wrong people. It is an ominous power that should have more oversight and more checks and balances. One of the statements that particu-larly bothered me was when the former head of the NSA, Michael Hayden, said: Well, we kill people based on metadata. That is an alarming statement to me. Metadata is whom you call and how long you talk to them. We remember they said that it was no big deal. Your metadata is not that private. You should just give it up. And for a while they were vacuuming up everyone’s metadata—whom you call and how long you talk. It turns out that they are so com-petent in metadata that they are actu-ally making kills based on metadata. That is what Hayden said. So we have before us a nominee for the National Counterterrorism Center who has some involvement with devel-oping these kill lists. So we asked him that question. I said: Do we kill people based on metadata? The nonanswer was very interesting. He said: Well, I can’t tell you because I am not in government. Well, my guess is he has been in gov-ernment, and he has been in the mili-tary. So he probably knows the answer, but he is saying that he will not tell the answer because he is not in govern-ment. So we said to ask the people who are in government: Do we kill people based on metadata? Do you know what every one of them said? None of my business. I was elected to the U.S. Senate to represent an entire State, and the peo-ple in the administration had the au-dacity to say: If you want to know that, why don’t you join the Intel-ligence Committee? See, a democratic republic is where all elected officials have oversight, not only a select few—often, a select few who actually are always in agreement with more power for the Intelligence Committee and become a rubberstamp simply for more power. Those of us who are skeptical of power, those of us who think we need to have more oversight are typically not on those committees. But the question is whether we should allow a select few to be the overseers. Often, these overseers aren’t a check and a balance. These overseers are peo-ple who simply say: We want to be con-sulted. When the President comes to you or the CIA comes to you and says ‘‘We are going to kill this person; oh, you have been consulted—often consulted after the fact, but you have been consulted,’’ that, to me, is not a check and a bal-ance. That is being a rubberstamp for the policy. The question has come up time and again, and the media looks and says: Oh, my goodness, this is a conspiracy theory, the deep state. There actually is a deep state, and the deep state has been around for decades and decades. In fact, the Church commission in the 1970s was set up to investigate the deep state. Who was the deep state in those days? It was Hoover. Hoover was using the enormous power of the intelligence agencies to investigate people he didn’t like—civil rights leaders and protesters of the Vietnam war—so he illegally used this power of intelligence gath-ering to spy on Americans. Americans were rightly upset. The Church commission tried to rein in the intelligence communities. But the in-teresting thing is, in those days, the power to do intelligence was some guy sneaking into your house and placing a little magnet on your phone. It is not done that way now. They can scoop up every phone call in America like that. They can scoop up every international phone call, every phone call to a coun-try. We can listen to what anybody is saying anywhere around the globe any time we want, and then we can kill anyone anytime, anywhere in the world. These are ominous powers and deserve more oversight. So when people refer to the deep state, that is what we are talking about—more oversight. What happens now is there are eight people in Congress who are consulted about intelligence, consulted about targeted killings—eight people. But they are not given a check and a bal-ance. They are consulted. They are told often after the fact. So, really, there are no checks and balances. This is an enormous, ominous power, and it is not checked. Those eight people are the leader of the Senate, the minority leader of the Senate, and the chairman and ranking member of the Intel-ligence Committee. It is the same on the House side. So eight people know anything. You say: Well, this certainly can’t be true. Certainly, they must brief all of you. Do you remember when they were collecting all of your phone data and

storing it in Utah? Everybody’s phone data, every phone call you were mak-ing, was being stored in Utah. One of the authors of the PATRIOT Act who had been involved in and had actually been supportive of this said that he was unaware of it and said that he didn’t believe the legislation that wrote the PATRIOT Act actually au-thorized that. There is not enough check and bal-ance. There is not enough oversight. We have seen it recently with the kill-ing of the Washington Post journalist and dissident, Khashoggi. The CIA con-cluded, according to media reports, with high probability that the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia—with a high de-gree of probability—was responsible for the killing. Was everybody told that? No, the public was not told that. Most of Congress, most of the Senate—I was not told that because the briefings are only for a select few. What happens is you get imperfect and not very good oversight; the checks and balances are not working because the only people being told about what the intelligence commu-nity is doing are the people who are rubberstamps for what they are doing. The skeptics, those who believe there is too much power, are not being told. My point in bringing that up with this nominee today is not the indi-vidual being nominated but that the deep state has circled its wagons, and they are preventing me from finding out: Do we kill people around the world based on metadata? It is a very simple question, it is a very specific question, and they are refusing to answer it. So I have been holding this nominee and will vote against the nominee be-cause I believe that the deep state needs more oversight. I believe that we shouldn’t kill anyone, anywhere, any-time around the world without some checks and balances. I also believe that our drone pro-gram, our targeted killing, actually makes the country less safe and makes us more at risk for terrorism. I think we should reevaluate this. We have had a top 20 kill list for 20 years. We just keep replenishing it with more and more and more. It is a never-ending top 20 list. I think we should reevaluate it. I think we should talk about, is there a way we can declare victory? I am proud of the President today to hear that he is declaring victory in Syria. Most of the voices around here like to stay everywhere for all time, and they believe that it doesn’t work unless you go somewhere and stay for-ever. The President has the courage to say that we won in Syria, and we are coming home—the first President in my lifetime really to do that. That is why President Trump is different, and that is why I think President Trump is one we should all look to for some changes and for some reform of the deep state. I yield back my time.

ORDER OF PROCEDURE  
Mr. M CCONNELL. Mr. President, just for the information of our colleagues, I expect the Maguire nomination to go by voice vote. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-jority whip. 
LEADERSHIP CHANGE  
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, today I rise to speak for the last time on the Senate floor as majority whip. With the swearing in of our colleagues in January, will come the changing of the guard in our elected leadership in which I have been proud to serve since 2006. As we all know, the whip is also known as the assistant majority lead-er, and I have been proud to assist our majority leader in all we have worked on together to accomplish in the Sen-ate. I often tell people that ‘‘whip’’ sounds a lot more coercive than it real-ly is because in the Senate, you can’t really make somebody do something they don’t want to do. I understand the term comes from the old country. It referred to the per-son in fox hunting who was responsible for keeping the dogs from straying dur-ing the chase—something I have never done and, no doubt, will never do. One of the fathers of modern conserv-atism, Edmund Burke, in the middle of a contentious debate in the British House of Commons, used the term as far back as 1769. When he used it, he was talking about enforcing discipline, not as a way to punish disobedience but as a way to stay focused on your goal. I think that meaning still holds because the overarching goal of anyone who serves in this position is to keep the team together. The first Republican whip was James Wadsworth, elected in 1915. He served in the Spanish-American War. He op-posed Prohibition, and he was chair-man of what was then known as the Committee on Military Affairs. In more recent times, the whips have been great Senators and friends, such as Don Nickles, Trent Lott, J
ONKYL, and of course, the current majority

leader, M ITCH MCCONNELL . All of these men have provided good examples and sound counsel to me at one time or an-other. What we have tried to do together is to build consensus, to make progress, little by little, for the American peo-ple, to seek to inform and gently per-suade. Mainly, you listen, and then, one by one, you address your col-leagues’ concerns. Then it is the job of the whip to count the votes, as the Senate leader passes or defeats legisla-tion, and provide advice and consent on nominees. It is the job of the whip operation to keep its finger on the pulse of the con-ference, to help the leader find a way to get from point A, a bill introduced, to point B, getting it to the floor, and then to point C, when the bill passes and becomes law. That road can be aw-fully bumpy at times. Sometimes, it is just like riding a roller coaster. As with any job, there are parts of the job you love more and those parts you love less. There has been a lot of handshaking after big victories, such as the Criminal Justice Reform bill we passed with a huge bipartisan majority last night, and then there is the head-shaking after disappointments. It is true that occasionally in this job you come up short, but you learn from your mistakes, you course cor-rect, and that failure can help you suc-ceed later on down the road. That is what happened to us in tax reform. We learned from our disappointing out-come on healthcare and applied it to our next major objective. With tax re-form, we laid the groundwork by going through the Finance Committee—reg-ular order. We helped inform. We cor-rected misinformation, and we re-sponded to feedback. We incorporated input from all Senators who wanted to be constructive and get to yes, and the final bill changed a lot along the way. Another victory I can think of is the passage of the Comprehensive Addic-tion and Recovery Act in 2016, which I think helped lay the groundwork for what we were able to achieve this Con-gress with the passage of landmark opioid legislation. Of course, there were a historic num-ber of judges we were able to confirm during the first 2 years of the Trump administration, culminating in not one, but two outstanding additions to the U.S. Supreme Court: Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. But the biggest challenge we faced this last year was the nomination of now-Justice Kavanaugh—hands down. Never in my experience has there been a bill or a nomination for which every single vote mattered more, and never have I seen the dynamics change so rapidly. The trajectory of the nomina-tion fluctuated day by day, hour by hour, and sometimes it seemed minute by minute. As new press reports or ru-mors circulated, the whip operation worked overtime to make sure our col-leagues had the most up-to-date infor-mation and knew what was and what was not accurate. To refute one rumor or accusation, my whip staff even had to find copies of 30-year-old high school yearbooks and go to the Library of Congress to research drinking games. I know it sounds silly, but sometimes truth is stranger than fiction. The re-search our whip staff put together made the difference for some of our colleagues in the homestretch. Eventually, as we now know, after a lot of hard work and long hours by an awful lot of people, Judge Kavanaugh was confirmed. But near-death experi-ences can make life all that much more sweet. So the difficulties we faced to-gether on the Kavanaugh nomination made his eventual confirmation all the more satisfying. Other highlights—the things I will remember the most and am most proud of—include the landmark bill we passed to combat human trafficking. The Justice for Victims of Human Trafficking Act—after 4 weeks on the Senate floor, thanks to Leader M
CCON-
NELL and his perseverance, that bill ul-timately passed 99 to 0, and we should be very proud of that. Following the horrific shooting at Sutherland Springs, TX, I introduced legislation to strengthen the gaps in the background check system for pur-chasing firearms. Those gaps had al-lowed a crazed shooter to cruelly take innocent lives one Sunday morning at a small Baptist Church outside of San Antonio. After we came together in a bipar-tisan way to pass this bill, I returned to Sutherland Springs. Being with those families, the community, and Pastor Frank Pomeroy—he and his wife lost their daughter—and letting them know we not only shared in their grieving but we had acted together to save lives by preventing future trage-dies was one of the most gratifying mo-ments I have experienced in the Sen-ate. We couldn’t wipe away their tears, but we could show the families that their loss had not been in vain. We have done a lot of other things that—while they didn’t make the front-page news—will greatly impact the lives of Texans and all Americans. We helped America become the energy powerhouse we knew it could be—cre-ating jobs along the way—by facili-tating liquefied natural gas exports, and we ended the export ban on crude oil all together. These will have geo-political consequences that will benefit the entire planet. We passed big bills, like the farm bill, and smaller but impactful bills, like occupational licensing reform, and legislation that improved trade be-tween Mexico and Canada. Then came Hurricane Harvey, the most extreme rain event in our Na-tion’s history. It hit the Texas gulf coast, and then after recovery was un-dertaken, we had the monumental task of putting together significant disaster relief for Texas as part of a larger dis-aster relief package that benefited many parts of the Nation. Our job still isn’t over, but by link-ing arms together, the Texas delega-tion, which we call ‘‘Team Texas,’’ worked with Governor Abbott and other State and local leaders to get them what was needed from the Fed-eral Government so that people could begin to put their lives back together. As whip, one of the best parts of my job was getting to know my colleagues better. I learned to listen to them more carefully. I learned that each of them has personal goals, political needs, re-gional interests, and philosophical principles that influence their decision making. We share a lot in common, but each of us is unique in mostly fascinating but sometimes infuriating ways. Even when you can’t convince someone your position is the right one, you always can learn from that interaction, and that is valuable information that can be used on the next tough vote. I also learned a lot about the Senate as an institution. What makes this in-stitution so interesting are the men and women who work here. We have doctors, business men and women, and farmers. Heaven knows, we have more than enough lawyers. We have spouses, parents, grandparents, great-grand-parents. We come from different polit-ical parties and different parts of the country, but we share a common goal: to do right for the people we are privi-leged to represent and to make our country a little bit better than when we came. We have very public arguments, but we also get a lot accomplished in quiet-er moments—over lunch, in the Senate well, in the cloakroom, or sometimes in the Senate gym. During those mo-ments, what shines through is my over-whelming impression of the intel-ligence, the seriousness of purpose, and the goodwill of the people who work here. That instills in me confidence that despite the swirling controversies that seem to engulf us, the Senate, as an institution, is strong. It is durable and will continue long after we are gone. The late great Bob Bullock, who served for many years as our State’s Lieutenant Governor, participating in Texas politics for most or about half of the 20th century, used to say that there are two types of politicians: those who want to be someone and those who want to do something. I will say that in my experience, most people I inter-act with here are of the latter persua-sion. They want to do something good for the American people. I want to express my best wishes to my friend, Senator T
HUNE , the senior Senator from South Dakota, who is taking over the whip job in January. I have every confidence in his ability to do the job, but I also confessed to him it is not all sunshine and lollipops. There will be long days and tough votes. We have all heard the expression that being the whip is like trying to keep the bullfrogs in the wheelbarrow; as soon as you get one in, another one jumps out.

ITCH M
CCONNELL . Under M
ITCH’s leadership in the last 2 years alone, we have bolstered our Na-tion’s economy, fixed our Tax Code, and achieved real regulatory reform. We have transformed our Judiciary, improved veterans’ healthcare, and ad-dressed critical public health needs like the opioid crisis. And that doesn’t even begin to scratch the surface. We have certainly had our fair share of nail-biters—I seem to remember a certain debt ceiling vote, for example— and those accomplishments I men-tioned were not easy, given the slim margins. But with Senator M
CCON-
NELL ’s leadership and more than a few prayers along the way, we did it to-gether. I am proud of our record, and I am grateful for his trust and con-fidence. Of course, we couldn’t have been suc-cessful without a strong and reliable team of deputy whips led by Senator M
IKECRAPO . I leaned on my deputy whip team regularly, and time and again, they delivered. So to Senators B
LUNT , CAPITO , CRAPO , FISCHER , GARD-
NER, L ANKFORD , P ORTMAN , S COTT, T
ILLIS , and Y OUNG , thank you. I also want to thank my whip staff, both current and former. This includes John Chapuis, Sam Beaver, Noah McCullough, Jody Hernandez, Emily Kirlin, Jonny Slemrod, and my first chief of staff, Russ Thomasson. What has been so amazing to me is how seamlessly my whip staff also worked with my Texas official staff as well. We all worked, literally, as one team. I thank all of my Texas staff for their contributions to our successes. We all rely on our staffs around here a great deal, and that is doubly true of my entire staff over the last 6 years. I have come to think of the whip oper-ation as really an intelligence oper-ation. These outstanding men and women have been my eyes and ears. They are all incredibly smart. They are devoted and hard-working. I say to all of them: Thank you for everything you have done to serve the conference and the Senate as a whole. As whip, you are provided with a se-curity detail comprised of Capitol Po-lice officers. These men and women are extraordinary professionals who have become like family. Their work often takes them away from their own fami-lies and friends as they travel around the country and sometimes miss holi-days and special occasions. They, like all of the Capitol Police, keep the peo-ple who work here and visit here safe. We all appreciate what they do for us each and every day. Finally, I want to say a few words about my chief of staff, Monica Popp, who is the chief of staff of my whip of-fice. Monica is often the first person and the last person on my staff I talk to each day. If Beth Jafari, who is my chief of staff in my Texas office, is the glue that keeps our operation together and operating at maximum efficiency, Monica is the spark plug of the oper-ation. As impressive as her knowledge of the Senate is and of how the U.S. Gov-ernment functions, that is not what sets her apart. She often, in her own gentle but determined way, has pressed me to make just one more call, to meet just one more time with a colleague, or to try just a little harder to nail down the winning votes. She is exactly the type of person you need to have in your corner, but it is her sunny disposi-tion—her optimism—that is infectious. In addition to her extraordinary com-petence, that makes her indispensable. Monica is known for cultivating and maintaining strong relationships not only in the Senate but in the House and in the executive branch. It is not just limited to my party; some of her closest colleagues work in the leader-ship offices of our Democratic col-leagues. The big bipartisan achieve-ments I mentioned earlier could not have happened without Monica and her ability to lead a team and work across the aisle. Part of the reason she is so effective is she wants to know every-thing. She even wants to know what Members have for breakfast because she knows how circumstances and small events can sometimes provide in-sight in unexpected ways. Here is how our staff describes her: ‘‘She is a problem solver.’’ ‘‘When you think you’re stuck, she’ll find creative ways to get a solution.’’ The most instructive, I think, is this: ‘‘You want to be around her just to learn.’’ I couldn’t agree more. To Monica, I say thank you. We couldn’t have done it without you. Even though I will no longer be serv-ing as the majority whip, I am not going anywhere. Believe me—serving 28 million Texans here in the Senate is a big enough job for anyone. To borrow a phrase from a great American leader, our late President George Herbert Walker Bush—he said: I am a Texan and an American. What more can a man ask for? Indeed, it is an honor and a privilege to represent the great people of Texas, and I believe my time as whip has only taught me to be a better representative of my fellow Texans. As an elected leader, I have learned that sometimes you have to do things nobody else wants to do because they are con-troversial or they are risky, but I stand ready to continue to take risks and ac-cept controversy in the pursuit of wor-thy causes. I close simply by saying it has been a privilege to serve as the whip for Texas, for the Republican conference, and for the Senate. Often, when I am introduced to audi-ences here and at home, the intro-ducers will refer to me as the No. 2 per-son in the Senate. Occasionally, they will call me the second most powerful person in the Senate—obviously an ex-aggeration. Yet I have never been quite able to bring myself to correct them in public if only to save them the embar-rassment. Let me just say I will now return to my previous life as the sec-ond most powerful person in my house-hold and to my continued service to Texas and the world’s greatest delib-erative body. I yield the floor. (Applause, Senators rising.) The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question occurs on the confirmation of the Maguire nomination.

We think we are easing towards going home. We think we are easing towards finishing the year, and everybody is ex-cited about that. We have talked about a lot of things we haven’t done. Let’s talk about what we have done, because I think this has been the most success-ful time I have had in Washington for 20 years.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S7835 December 19, 2018 
America. I want everybody to remem-ber four things to take home that you have done to see to it that our men and women who fight for us and keep us safe get treated the way they should every day. No. 1 is the VA MISSION Act. After a number of years, when we started moving towards a way to get better appointments, better timing, and better results for our veterans, we finally came together with the VA MISSION Act. We saw to it that if a veteran needed health needs met, he got them when he needed them, not when it was convenient for him to get them. If the VA couldn’t provide them, the private sector could. He could go to the private sector. We have done every-thing we can to expand accessibility to quality healthcare. Our vets are the most important assets we have. The second is the accountability bill. For a lot of years, we saw on the front pages of the newspapers that the VA had done stupid things and that a lot of VA employees had done stupid things. The way they got corrected—the way they got punished—was to be trans-ferred to another VA office. We finally passed a bill whereby if you don’t do your job, if you hurt the people you are there to protect—meaning our vets— then you get fired. You have a 10-day appeal, and then you are through. You don’t get paid forever. You don’t get moved. You don’t get switched around. We make sure you have pure account-ability. Because of that, the VA is more responsive today than it has ever been. With that, we had to put in whistle-blower protection to allow our vets who find out something is going wrong but who are afraid to say something to have the protection that everybody has with whistleblower laws we have passed. The third biggest problem we had and the No. 1 headache we have is seeing to it that veterans’ benefits are timely and that they get a good appeal. The timeliness in approving veterans’ ap-plications for that had gone to as much as a year and a half to 2 years before they had gotten decisions. Now we have better accountability with the improved results we are seeing in giv-ing our veterans their benefits and their approvals in a more timely way. I hope, before I leave the Senate, when-ever that will be, we will get it down to almost zero. They don’t get the luxury of waiting when they are on the battle-field. They have to pull and fight when they are confronted. So we need to make sure they get that benefit today. Lastly and most importantly, as we have said, our veterans are our most important people. We now have the Agency focused in the right direction. We have a good Secretary in Secretary Wilkie. We have a good focus in what we are doing, and we have passed the types of acts that are necessary to get a bureaucracy to become a responsible organization. We have seen to it that the benefits we are supposed to protect are not only protected but are deliv-ered as well. Thank you for the time I have been given to address the Senate. I hope all of us go home and remember that our most important people are our vet-erans. Also remember what each of you has done in passing these improve-ments—seeing to it that the GI bill is now permanent for everybody in that there are no more caps on their time; seeing to it that veterans in the Re-serves and veterans on Active Duty are treated the same; and seeing to it that we have accountability and benefits for our veterans so no one is left behind and so the United States of America will continue to be the greatest coun-try on the face of this Earth. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Connecticut. 
f 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST— H.R. 299 Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague and friend Senator I
SAKSON , as well as the ranking mem-ber, Senator T
ESTER , for their leader-ship on the Veterans’ Affairs Com-mittee in this past session. I have been proud and honored to work with them, and I look forward to doing so in the next Congress on issues so important and challenging. We have a responsi-bility to meet the needs of our vet-erans. In that spirit, I ask unanimous con-sent that the Veterans’ Affairs Com-mittee be discharged from further con-sideration of H.R. 299, the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act of 2017, and that the Senate proceed to its im-mediate consideration; that the bill be considered read a third time and passed; and that the motion to recon-sider be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Georgia. Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, reserv-ing the right to object, my apologies to those on the floor who wish to speak. We have spoken a couple of times about this on the floor. I want to do it one more time. I appreciate the motion by the gen-tleman who had been my ranking mem-ber on the committee for 2 years before this current session of the Senate. The blue water Navy has been an issue that has been controversial. It has almost been passed a few times, and it has been defeated a number of times. Our veterans, today, who served in Vietnam and who have ended up con-tracting cancer—non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and things like that—do not have the luxury of presumption of cause on their service in Vietnam un-less they served on the land. If they served on the land in the battlefield, they get the benefit, but if they served at sea, where most of this napalm and all of the other agents were delivered— on those ships—they don’t have that benefit. The VA bifurcated a benefit of healthcare to our veterans—many of whom contracted cancer and many of whom have died—and said: If you are on the land, you get it. If you are on the sea, we will not let you have it. It is the wrong thing to do. No vet-eran who served on the land is more important or less important than the one who served at sea. We have a chance to do this, and we ought to do it. I am going to vote in favor of adopt-ing the motion by the gentleman from Connecticut. Let me just say one other thing. There is a letter floating around about the cost of this and about the cost esti-mates we had. We got a new cost esti-mate yesterday after our having spent years in the committee trying to get a better cost estimate. We got one yes-terday that was higher than the day before. I don’t know what its credi-bility is. I am not going to cast asper-sions on the credibility of the CBS. Ob-viously, nothing should surpass a promise we have made for healthcare coverage to our veterans that they are not getting. That is what we owe to them, and I hope everybody will vote to support the blue water Navy benefit with regard to the motion by the Sen-ator from Connecticut. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Utah. Mr. LEE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I have great respect for my distinguished friends and col-leagues, including my colleagues from Connecticut and from Georgia. I will also add that there is no doubt that all of us owe a great debt of gratitude to the brave men and women who fought and served in the Vietnam war. There is no question that they endured un-speakable hardships there and, of course, for many decades following their service. For some, one of these hardships in-volved exposure to Agent Orange. This very potent chemical was widely used by the U.S. military during the Viet-nam war as part of its herbicidal war-fare program, and it has proven to have been something that has caused major health problems for the service men and women who were exposed to it. So Congress passed the Agent Orange Act of 1991 to provide health benefits for those servicemembers who were af-fected by it. The act presumes the service connec-tion for diseases caused by herbicides for Active military, naval, or air serv-icemembers when, and only when, there is scientific and medical evidence to support it. In 2002, the VA removed the blue water Navy veterans from the pre-sumption of exposure, as they had looked at the data repeatedly under multiple administrations and had not found evidence to grant the presump-tion. The bill now under consideration would restore this presumption to the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES7836 December 19, 2018 
blue water Navy veterans, but pru-dence demands that we wait until we have more complete information and evidence to make this presumption. In fact, previous studies have lumped all the branches of the services together into their analyses or they focused solely on the Army. In other words, they failed to differentiate between those who were Active on the ground and those who were serving on ships miles offshore. Now we have a chance to get that precise data. The VA is currently un-dertaking a study, slotted to be re-leased in the early months of 2019, that examines the myriad of health factors in Vietnam veterans and specifically includes a subsample of blue water Navy veterans. It is only right and only reasonable that Congress should examine this study before making any presumption of a service connection for all blue water Navy veterans from this war. The brave men and women who have sacrificed so much for our country should undoubtedly get the medical care they need in connection with their service. As Members of this body, it is also our duty to ensure it is done in a pru-dent and proper way, with all the rel-evant information available to us. Our veterans deserve no less, and it is for this reason that I have concerns with it. I have received calls from Secretary Wilkie and from four previous VA Sec-retaries, all of whom have said consist-ently that the VA has been strapped with difficulties in recent years. We have to make sure the VA has the tools it needs to offer the services it needs to offer to our veterans. Doing something that would offset that, as these VA Secretaries have concluded, would be unwise. On that basis, I object. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-jection is heard. The Senator from Connecticut. Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I greatly respect my colleague from Utah, and I thank our friend from Georgia for his positive remarks on this topic, but more than words are necessary; we need action. We need dol-lars and cents to brave Americans who undertook to serve this country, who risked their lives, and who have suf-fered for years and years from the se-vere health effects of their contact with Agent Orange and other toxins on the battlefield. They deserve the same benefits as their comrades who served on land. They served in the territorial waters. Year after year they have been denied simple justice—action that ful-fills our obligation to them. I greatly respect the words, the rhetoric, the pledges, but asking them to wait denies them justice. There is an adage we quote fre-quently: Justice delayed is justice de-nied. That maxim has particular force here because these veterans, very sim-ply, are passing away. They will be de-nied the benefits they are owed by this Nation. They will be deprived of the just compensation for injuries they re-ceived, like their fellow veterans who served boots on the ground on land, if they are not compensated for the inju-ries they received when they served in those territorial waters off Vietnam. This measure has been brought to the floor before. Last week, I joined my colleagues Senators T
ESTER , G ILLI-
BRAND , DAINES , and B ROWN to demand that simple justice for blue water Navy veterans. Today I am joined by Senator B
ALDWIN of Wisconsin, my very distin-guished colleague and friend, to whom I will yield shortly. Our calls to unanimously pass H.R. 299 were blocked, and that is why we are back here again. In these closing hours of this session, we have the op-portunity and obligation to do right by those veterans and to follow our words by our actions. Today the Senate has another chance, even in these last hours, to right a wrong. Currently, the VA gives the benefit of the doubt to some veterans who have been exposed to toxic substances but not to others. Despite the fact that de-foliants were indiscriminately used, only some of those veterans who were affected by them—those veterans suf-fering from cancer and skin disease and other aftereffects—are eligible for healthcare and benefits to address the health effects of their exposure. Others, like Gerry Wright of Con-necticut, are forced to shoulder the burden of proving they are suffering from this toxic exposure. I ask my colleagues to reconsider their opposition. I ask them to think about the veterans of their own States who suffer from these kinds of diseases. I ask them to consider men and women like Eugene Clarke of Redding, CT. Be-cause of his experience in Vietnam, he has spent most of his years fighting on behalf of veterans who served there and veterans who served in Korea in the 1960s. He has been a champion. His ad-vocacy, backed by strong support from the Veterans of Foreign Wars, shine a light on these problems. Today only veterans who were served on the Korean DMZ, from April 1968 through August 1971, are eligible for presumption, despite the fact that from 1966 through 1969, about 55,000 service-members were sent to Korea each year. Mr. Clarke was instrumental in pro-viding evidence that defoliants were sprayed during testing prior to 1968. His efforts have inspired me and my colleagues to introduce the Fairness for Korean DMZ Veterans Act. He is a veteran of that experience. He has fought for the Korean veterans, but he has also added his weight in support of the Vietnam veterans who served after he did. Two years ago, I pledged to Mr. Clarke that I would fight as long and as hard as possible to make sure vet-erans who served in the Korean DMZ receive compensation and healthcare if they suffer from agent orange-linked illnesses. I am here today because of him, because of Korean War veterans, and because of Korean veterans who served in the DMZ. I ask my colleagues to reconsider their opposition. In the limited number of days left in the 115th Congress, we have this important opportunity. We have this tremendous opportunity for anybody who cares about not only the veterans of Vietnam but also their de-scendants by extending healthcare, vo-cational training and rehabilitation, as well as providing a monetary allowance to children suffering from the aftereffects through their parents. I ask my colleagues to do the right thing. I yield to my colleague from Wis-consin. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Wisconsin. Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, I rise today to ask the Senate to come to-gether and do the right thing for our veterans by passing the blue water Navy legislation. I thank my colleague from Connecticut for his leadership, and I join him in appreciating the re-marks of the Senator from Georgia in support of advancing this legislation in the final days of this session. As a result of the VA changing its policy, Vietnam blue water Navy vet-erans have to meet higher burdens of proof to receive healthcare and dis-ability benefits that they earned due to their exposure to Agent Orange. I have heard from many veterans and their families from across Wisconsin asking that the Senate pass this bill because they don’t have any more time to wait. A veteran’s family from Reedsburg, WI, wrote to me. They wrote: 
Senator Baldwin, my brother-in-law did three tours off the coast of Vietnam on an ammunition ship. He has contracted brain cancer, lung cancer, diabetes and hearing loss. We have submitted a request for com-pensation for these ailments. All requests have been denied and we are still appealing. This House bill passed unanimously and now languishes in the Senate. My brother-in-law is in hospice with limited time remaining. Please pass this legislation. 
I heard from a veteran from Stetsonville, WI. He said: 
I served in the U.S. Navy and spent 1966 aboard the USS Intrepid as a gun fire controlman. I have been diagnosed with stage 4 non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and large hairy cell leukemia. The lymphoma is cur-rently in remission, but the leukemia is un-treatable. On August 10, 2018, I had open-heart quin-tuple-bypass surgery as well. My children and grandchildren are suffering from my ex-posure to the dioxins found in Agent Orange which polluted the waters of the Tonkin Gulf. Please get the VA to do its job of car-ing for, treating, and recognizing the service- connected disability of the many Navy vets now suffering. The money for this care was originally pro-vided for, prior to 1991, when the VA arbi-trarily disallowed the gulf sailors. It is time to correct this breach of promise to care for our veterans, and I am asking for your help in getting the Blue Water Navy bill passed in the Senate, as it was unanimously passed in the House.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S7837 December 19, 2018 
I am disappointed that Senator B
LUMENTHAL ’s request to pass this bill was just objected to by my colleague from Utah. Some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have argued that we can’t afford the cost of this legislation, but I heard no such objec-tions when those same colleagues voted for a very partisan tax bill that gave huge tax breaks to the largest corpora-tions and added $1.9 trillion to our Na-tion’s debt. Now, when it comes to doing right by our Vietnam veterans who served this country and are now dying from their illnesses, we don’t have the money to spend to help get them better or to help give their fami-lies a little more time with them. That is simply wrong. How much is it costing blue water Navy veterans who are trying to beat cancer? How much is it costing their caregivers who quit their jobs in order to take care of them? We have a moral obligation to fix this, and we have the opportunity to get this done right now. These veterans fought for us and are dying from their service-connected ill-nesses. It is past time to do the right thing and pass this bill. We need to do it now, and we should not leave town until it is done. Thank you. I yield back to Senator B
LUMENTHAL . The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Connecticut. Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, in closing, I am grateful to my col-league from Wisconsin and my col-leagues across the aisle. This measure was bipartisan. It was passed unani-mously in the House of Representa-tives. It should be unanimous here. The money is not a problem. The money is there. The predictions about out-landish possible financial exposure are simply products of fantasy. I know my Republican colleagues almost unani-mously on the other side of the aisle understand that simple fact. But even if the costs were higher than they are projected to be, we have an obligation to do the right thing. We have a moral duty to make sure we fulfill our prom-ise. I know the Presiding Officer has been a strong advocate for our veterans. I know my fellow members on the Vet-erans’ Affairs Committee join me in this belief. The costs of this program are the costs of war. They are the costs of keeping our troops on the DMZ in Korea. They are the costs of having sent them to Vietnam. They are the costs of sending our troops to Iraq and Afghanistan, and this measure would provide a study of the possible effects in terms of their health from those kinds of poisonous and toxic exposures. The modern battlefield is filled with toxins and poisons, and the injuries that result from them are the costs of war. We need to recognize that fact and refuse, absolutely reject the possibility that we will continue to delay even longer the justice these men and women deserve. I can pledge to my colleagues that if we fail to do it this session, we will be back again next session. The costs to our conscience, if not to our budget, will rise in the meantime. I am pleased to call on my very dis-tinguished colleague and military vet-eran from Illinois, Senator DUCKWORTH . The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Illinois. Ms. DUCKWORTH. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Connecticut. Right now, tens of thousands of American heroes are suffering and even dying while some folks in government are looking the other way, refusing to heed their calls for help. Our blue water veterans answered the call when their Nation needed them in the thick of the Vietnam war. They left their loved ones, boarded ships, fought the Viet Cong, and risked their lives hour after hour, day after day, in service to the country they love. We made a promise to them: Fight for us overseas, and we will fight for you when you get back home. When you step back on U.S. soil, we will ban-dage the wounds you earned in combat, making sure you never feel you sac-rificed in vain. I am ashamed to say that promise has been broken. For decades now, our government has refused to give them the healthcare and disability benefits needed to treat diseases linked to Agent Orange exposure despite the fact that they serviced the very aircraft that sprayed and spread the chemical. Despite that they breathed in the air and brushed their teeth with water that was likely laced with the poison, they have not been given the healthcare they need. Those same healthcare benefits have been extended to other troops who fought in the same war during the same years, but because these blue water veterans fought the enemy on the water rather than on Vietnam soil itself, our government won’t lift a fin-ger to stop their suffering. Tell me that is fair. Tell me that makes a shred of sense. Tell me that our Nation should abandon the heroes who risked their lives for the rest of us, that we should leave them to die from cancer or heart disease or the litany of other diseases we know this chemical causes. Look, I have also gone to war, and just as those Americans lost their health, I was wounded for this country. But from the moment I woke up in Walter Reed, I knew that the VA would give me the care I needed to recover. These nearly 90 thousand veterans de-serve the same. It is long past time we pass legislation ensuring that these he-roes are not left in pain. Unfortunately, legislation that would recognize their sacrifice suffered a set-back last week, but with the time re-maining in this Congress, we still have the chance to make those veterans whole, to do the right thing, the obvi-ous thing, the American thing. To every one of my fellow Senators, please, if we actually want to honor their service, we can’t just give them an ovation on Veterans Day; we need to take action to help them lead full, healthy lives every other day of the year too. Right now, that means join-ing me in working to pass the Blue Water Navy Veterans Act before even one more hero dies a preventable death on our watch. It is the right thing to do. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Connecticut. Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I wish to close by thanking my col-leagues, Senator D
UCKWORTH and Sen-ator B
ALDWIN , and say that I would like to end this session on a positive note. I am going to be proud to yield to one of my very good friends and one of our most distinguished colleagues, Sen-ator S

I hope that in the next session, this great body will see it in its heart, as well as mind and conscience, to do the right thing—not sometime in the next 2 years but in the first days and weeks so that these veterans have simple jus-tice. I will champion it. I know col-leagues on the other side of the aisle will join us, and we can get it done. We must. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

He has chaired three Senate class A commit-tees during his tenure in the Senate, including the Finance Committee, of which he is currently the chairman. He has chaired with distinction the Judici-ary Committee and the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pen-sions. Some of his major accomplish-ments—these are just a few—include

His ac-complishments also include confirma-tion right here in the Senate of con-servative judges to the Federal bench— hundreds and hundreds—including playing an instrumental role in the confirmation of Supreme Court Jus-tices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Brett Kavanaugh, as well as, as I said, scores, if not hun-dreds, of district and circuit court judges. One of Senator H
ATCH ’s particularly noteworthy achievements, among oth-ers, on the Judiciary Committee is the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, a bill he authored and cosponsored with the late Senator Ted Kennedy. It was landmark legislation allowing Americans to live, to work, and to wor-ship in accordance with their beliefs. Senator H
ATCH ’s reputation as a statesman and his record of fiscal re-sponsibility even earned him the nick-name ‘‘Mr. Balanced Budget’’ from President Reagan. Senator H
ATCH is also widely known for his musical career and film appear-ances. He plays the violin, the piano, and the organ. Think of the talent this man has. Senator H
ATCH and his wife, Elaine, have been married for more than 50 years. They have 6 children, 23 grand-children, and many great-grand-children. Think of a lifetime achieve-ment, and he has, I believe, many years left. He will be truly missed here in the Senate, and I wish him all the best in the next chapter of his life. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Iowa. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
FIRST STEP ACT Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today is a good day for representative government, it is a good day for the taxpayers, and it is a good day for safe streets and strong families. It is also a good day to emphasize that many times Congress acts in a bipartisan way, and probably not enough so we get credit for it. But last night, one of these bipartisan pieces of legislation passed by a vote of 87 to 12. That hap-pened when the Senate adopted the FIRST STEP Act. Today, the House is expected to send it to the President, who is waiting with a pen in hand to enact once-in-a-gen-eration criminal justice reform. I am confident that the President is ready to do that because I attended the news conference about 5 weeks ago when he endorsed this legislation. The FIRST STEP Act will help keep our streets safe, and it offers a fresh start to those who put in the work when they were in prison to get right with the law while paying their debt to society. It also addresses unfairness in prison sentencing and revises policies that have led to overcrowded prisons and, of course, ballooning taxpayer ex-penses. Several decades ago, Congress passed well-intentioned laws imposing harsh mandatory sentences to stop the flow of drugs into our communities, and it happened that I voted for those laws, but they have also had some unin-tended consequences. Our prison popu-lation has exploded, and the taxpayers’ burden to house inmates has followed suit. Today, taxpayers pay more than $7 billion a year on our Federal prison population; however, despite that high cost, nearly half the inmates released today are rearrested. As a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee for the last 38 years, I con-sider myself—then and now—a law-and- order Republican. I am also a taxpayer watchdog, and I believe in the redemp-tive power of rehabilitation. So in 2015, I began to take a closer look at our prison and sentencing laws. We needed to make the system work better for the taxpayers, help law enforcement fight crime, and put a stopper in the revolv-ing prison door. I was led to that effort by the efforts of Senator LEEand Sen-ator D
URBIN , who had been working on similar legislation for probably 3 to 4 years before my entry into this debate. Several States across the country have developed these education, treat-ment, and training programs. The re-sult has been a significant decline in recidivism. This means fewer crimes, fewer victims, and fewer tax dollars spent housing inmates. The FIRST STEP Act is carefully crafted to provide opportunities at re-demption for low-risk inmates, while ensuring that dangerous and career criminals stay behind bars. It does this through a multilayer system that fil-ters out dangerous criminals and those likely to commit new crimes. The bill rewards those who take per-sonal responsibility for their mistakes and want to put in the time and will put in the time and effort to turn their lives around. It improves fairness in sentencing while preserving important law en-forcement tools. It reduces some mandatory minimum sentences, but it also expands their ap-plication to include violent felons. It grants judges additional discretion to sentence low-level, nonviolent of-fenders to less lengthy sentences as long as they fully cooperate with law enforcement. Finally, it eliminates the disparity in sentences for crack and powder cocaine offenses, which dis-proportionately impacts communities of color. Passing these reforms has been a team effort years in the making. It couldn’t have been done without the stalwart commitment by a somewhat unlikely cadre of colleagues and advo-cates. We have had to compromise to make this possible, to seek to under-stand the other’s points of view. In so doing, I think we made the bill better, and we accomplished something of his-toric significance that will reduce crime, make our system more just, and improve lives for generations to come. Senators DURBIN and L EE, as I pre-viously stated, were instrumental in this effort. Their interest in criminal justice reform dates back beyond my getting involved in it in 2014. The exact date, I don’t know, but probably after Senators L
EEand D URBIN joined hands, probably soon after Senator L
EEcame to the Senate. Their efforts inspired the Senate to take a fresh look at our sentencing and prison laws. Senator G
RAHAM , the incoming chair-man of the Judiciary Committee, Sen-ator C
ORNYN , and Senator W HITEHOUSE  have also been with us since the very beginning of this effort. Senators B
OOKER and S COTT both share a passion for criminal justice re-form and have been vocal advocates, shining a light on the shortcomings and societal impact of our current sys-tem. Credit is also due to our House col-leagues—Chairman G
OODLATTE , Rank-ing Member N
ADLER , and Congressmen C
OLLINS and J EFFRIES , who introduced the FIRST STEP Act in the House. And thanks to Speaker R
YANfor his support and pledge to bring this to the House floor so quickly. At every step along the way, we have stuck together. We pitched this bill to our colleagues and made changes based on their suggestions. We also relied on input and expertise from a variety of groups from across the political spec-trum. In the end, this campaign earned the support of several top law enforce-ment and tough-on-crime champions, such as President Trump. I think it is important to acknowl-edge the President’s leadership on this issue. When he got involved, he closed the deal, and we got this done. He was helped in that effort by Jared Kushner. Early in President Trump’s adminis-tration, I happened to be in the Oval Office of the new President. Jared Kushner was there, and we discussed taking up criminal justice reform. I just asked him if he was interested in it. I wanted to give him a phone call, so we had that phone call. He took the issue and ran with it and helped find a way forward to accomplish something previous administrations had tried and failed to do. Brooke Rollins and Ja’Ron Smith at the White House were also in-strumental in this effort, working with Jared Kushner. I would also like to thank the major-ity leader for staying true to his word and bringing this bill to the floor when we demonstrated the support for our effort that he demanded. In the end, I appreciated his vote for this bill. Thanks also is due to the Senate floor staff on both sides of the aisle

who helped us successfully navigate the bill to final passage. I want to thank my Senate staff, who helped make this possible. Bipartisan compromise is not for the faint of heart, and they have stayed true to the commitment that Senator D
URBIN and I made to each other to move forward step-by-step in complete agreement about the path we should take and the path we had to take. I would like to thank my Judiciary Committee staff director, Kolan Davis. Kolan’s steady hand and sound judg-ment improves everything he is in-volved in. I value his counsel today, just as I have for the last 33 years. By my side today is Aaron Cum-mings, my chief Constitution counsel and crime counsel. He led the effort to negotiate this bipartisan deal in my of-fice and worked hard to see it through and to organize a vast coalition of sup-port. Of course, he also worked closely with other committee staff members in that direction. I would also like to thank Brian Simonsen for his diligent work on this important bill. Our Department of Justice detailees to the Judiciary Committee, Tom Sul-livan and Erin Creegan, provided very good technical advice. My sincere thanks also goes to my talented communications team—Tay-lor Foy, Judiciary Committee commu-nications director, and George Hart-mann, Judiciary Committee press sec-retary, as well as Michael Zona—for their dedication to this effort and their successful campaign to educate and persuade so many to support this bill. I am also thankful for my personal office staff, led by my chief of staff, Jill Kozeny. Jill has been my trusted adviser for over 30 years. She is leaving my staff, and I will be sad to see her go. She has been an exceptional leader, solving problems that I didn’t even know I had, and she has done it all with matchless grace and what I like to call Iowa nice. I am also grateful to Jennifer Heins, who keeps me on track and provides sound strategic advice. Their contributions and those of every staffer who was part of this ef-fort have been invaluable. I would like to thank Senator D
UR-
BIN’s staff, particularly his chief coun-sel, Joe Zogby, and his counsel, Rachel Rossi. Working with my staff, the White House, and others, they must have helped us close the deal more than a dozen times. That is an exam-ple—maybe it is 10 times; maybe it is 20 times. But closing deals many times is what it takes to get to the biparti-sanship that it took to get 87 votes on this bill. Of course, in the end, their dedication—and that includes cre-ativity and every effort they could put forth—got the job done. I want to give particular thanks to the law enforcement groups whose sup-port and input were key to the bill’s success, including the Fraternal Order of Police, the International Associa-tion of Chiefs of Police, the National Organization of Black Law Enforce-ment Executives, the National District Attorneys Association, the Association of Prosecuting Attorneys, and Law En-forcement Leaders. I am getting to the end. I would also like to thank the groups that made this effort possible. A diverse group and broad coalition of other groups, from the ACLU to the American Con-servative Union, supported this bill. I can’t list all the groups that offered their key support, but they include FreedomWorks, Justice Action Net-work, Americans for Tax Reform, Her-itage Action, the Due Process Insti-tute, Faith & Freedom Coalition, R Street, Right on Crime, Texas Public Policy Foundation, Prison Fellowship, and members of the Interfaith Crimi-nal Justice Coalition.

Mr. GRASSLEY. This was a com-bined effort, one on a scale not often seen in Washington these days. I am grateful for everyone’s work to bring about these historic reforms. Together, we have taken steps to reduce crime and recidivism, to strengthen faith and fairness in the criminal justice system, and to signal to those willing to make amends that redemption is within their reach. Together, we have taken an im-portant step to live up to the commit-ment we make every time we pledge al-legiance to the flag of the United States: to provide liberty and justice for all. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. H
YDE-SMITH). The assistant Demo-cratic leader. Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, let me first say how grateful I am to Sen-ator G
RASSLEY for his friendship, No. 1., and his leadership, No. 2. It has been one of the highlights of my Senate ex-perience to work with him on this bill. We trust one another. It reached a point where he said: I am not going to make a big decision unless you tell me it is all right, and I hope you will feel the same way when it comes to deci-sions affecting me. And I did, and it

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES7840 December 19, 2018 
paid off because we came to trust one another. We worked together to reach a point last night where we passed a bill which I think will be judged in a positive way in the history of our coun-try. I might add that Senator M
IKELEEof Utah was an early ally in this effort, but our team wasn’t putting together a winning record until C
HUCK GRASSLEY  joined the squad—not only joined it but led it. Then we brought in C
ORY B
OOKER , who was a valuable spokes-person and ally when it came to bring-ing groups together on the left and in the center to achieve this bill. Last night, the four of us celebrated a vic-tory. But the victory was not ours; it was a victory for the American people and for those who want to make sure we have a just system when it comes to criminal law and prison terms that fol-low from those convicted. For those three Senators who joined me, I can’t thank you enough. I really hope we can get the band back together sometime for another issue. Maybe it is the second step. Whatever it is, I would like to continue to work with this group and expand it to those who would like to be part of our effort. I think we showed something last night that most American people wouldn’t believe: that a bipartisan group of Senators from across the po-litical spectrum could tackle one of the toughest political issues of our day; as-semble an array of support—left, right, and center—from Members of the Sen-ate, as well as organizations devoted to law enforcement and civil rights; and at the end of it, have something we all felt was a fair product to send over to the House, which I hope will act on this very quickly. I will say a few words about how we reached that point in a moment, but I want to take time now, as Senator G
RASSLEY has, to honor the staff of my office, who have done such an excep-tional job to bring us to this moment. Joe Zogby. Joe has been my chief counsel for several years now. For 6 years, he has worked tirelessly to get this legislation through the Senate— and I mean tirelessly. He fielded calls to negotiate the provisions of this bill at the same time he was coaching his sons in baseball and trying to take care of his family responsibility. Joe was available every hour of the day and night. A special word of thanks to his wife, Lamece Baligh, and their sons, James, Elias, and Luke. I want to apologize to them for taking their dad away so many times for lengthy conversations, but we would never have reached suc-cess last night without that input from their father and husband. This win would not have happened without the dogged determination of Joe Zogby. He is a rabid Phillies fan, so he is always looking forward to the next season and the next victory. Last night, finally, we won the World Series and passed this bill on the floor of the Senate. No matter what assignment I give to Joe Zogby, whether it is the most tech-nical, difficult, and challenging immi-gration issues or coming up with a new system of criminal justice or improve-ments to our system criminal justice, he always rises to the occasion. I am truly blessed to have him as my chief counsel. I may get the headlines, but, believe me, Joe Zogby deserves the credit. By his side was Rachel Rossi. Rachel is a detailee to our office. She comes from the public defender’s office. She told me this morning that they had warned her ahead of time this was probably going to be a pretty lack-luster and boring experience, and noth-ing serious was going to be considered or passed during the time she was a detailee. Well, quite the opposite was true. She was here to be an integral part of the construction of this legisla-tion and its passage. She is leaving as detailee at the end of the year, and I am going to miss her. While she will be missed, she is leaving our office on the highest possible note. Rachel, I wish you the best. You were an important part of the legislation that passed last night. Stephanie Trifone is our office coun-sel. She is involved in every issue that goes through the Senate Judiciary Committee. She played a supporting role to ensure that the bill was prop-erly written and fielded countless calls and emails to keep our Senate staff and other staff well informed. She has been a steady hand, and we needed her every step of the way. The rest of my team has its own as-signments. Some of them worked tan-gentially on this bill, but I really couldn’t function without Dan Swan-son. He takes another agenda in the Senate Judiciary Committee, pri-marily on the civil side, and there is none better. There are times when peo-ple who were so-called experts would visit my office and say: Where does this Swanson learn all of these issues in such detail? Well, he is a pretty bright guy, and I am lucky to have him. His day in the hot seat will soon come when we face another issue. Debu Gandhi is an associate counsel. He is relatively new compared to the others, but I like his style and his de-termination. I have never asked any-thing of him that he hasn’t produced the very best quality project in a time-ly way. Manpreet Kaur Teji is the legislative correspondent who has to field all of the mail when I get up and give speech-es that either make people happy or angry. I thank her for her commitment to our office. I want to say a word about my floor staff. Reema Dodin has been with me since she was an intern in my office in Chicago. She went on to graduate law school and came to join my staff and eventually became my floor director. I didn’t realize how much she was study-ing Senate procedure, but she has real-ly become a valuable asset, not just to my office but to the Senate when we consider the options under the Senate rules. Having been parliamentarian in the Illinois State Senate for 10 or 12 years, I can tell you that those who work in the parliamentarian’s office, as well as those in support staff who are inter-ested in Senate procedure, are abso-lutely essential to the successful con-sideration of important bills. Reema is in a unique position of helping to ma-neuver and whip the bill on both the Democratic and Republican sides of the aisle. She certainly did her job last night with 87 votes in favor of our leg-islation. MJ Kenny is by her side. He is the deputy floor director. He was always in the cloakroom and always on the floor to ensure the FIRST STEP Act had a fair shot of consideration and passage. MJ and Reema are an incredible floor team. I am lucky to have them, and I thank them both. Corey Tellez is my legislative direc-tor. She ensured that all of the staff worked together to finalize the bill. She kept our office and other offices well informed every step of the way. Emily Hampsten, my communica-tions director, has been sending out messages from my office on a bipar-tisan basis from the beginning. She is always there with a smile and does pro-fessional work, and I thank her so much for her work. Claire Reuschel is my director of scheduling. She controls my life more than anyone other than my wife. She sends me places when she thinks it is right, and she usually has good judg-ment in those decisions. She has navi-gated thousands of meetings and phone calls on this legislation and so many other things. To say that she is an im-portant part of this process is a gross understatement. Finally, Pat Souders is my chief of staff. He has been with me from the be-ginning. He started off in the House and now has assembled, I think, the best team on Capitol Hill. I thank him for not only finding these talented peo-ple but making sure that they get along with one another and that in their cooperation we can serve the peo-ple of Illinois first and the Nation in the most effective way. I couldn’t do it without Pat Souders. Let me say that this moment in his-tory arrived because we had an idea that was due; it is an idea whose time was due. It was due for a number of reasons. Thirty years ago, in the war on drugs, we were so frightened by crack cocaine that as a House Member, I ended up casting what I considered one of the worst votes in my career. I voted for the 100-to-1 crack to powder dis-parity in sentencing. It meant what it said: You would get 100 times the pen-alty for the same amount of crack co-caine as you would have in powder co-caine—the same narcotic, different form, dramatically different results.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S7841 December 19, 2018 
We tried this in an effort to scare America straight, to let them know we were serious. We would get tough and use all of the political muscle we could find to stop the spread of crack co-caine. It was cheap. It was easily pro-duced. It was deadly, especially to the fetus being carried by the addicted mother, and it scared us. I voted for that bill and have regretted it ever since. I know what happened; it didn’t work. You couldn’t scare people straight. We ended up with more people addicted. The price of drugs on the street went down, and we started fill-ing our prisons, primarily with Afri-can-American and Latinos inmates who were convicted under these crimes. We knew in our heart of hearts that like so many other laws, it was unfair. The majority—majority—of users of narcotics and dealers of narcotics are White. Seventy-five percent of those who are convicted and sent to prison for crimes related to drug dealing and use are African American and Latino. This disparity on its face tells us that our system was fundamentally un-fair and ineffective. I believe that is the reason we decided last night to stop trying to muscle our way through the drug war and start using our brains: What is it that will work, that will make certain those who are truly guilty pay a price and those who can be rehabilitated get that chance? It is as basic as that. There is a second thing that has hap-pened in America in recent years, and it is heartbreaking when you see the results. We are facing the worst drug epidemic in our history. For the first time in decades—maybe in modern memory—we are being told that life ex-pectancy in the United States is going down. It is because of the opioid drug epidemic. Thousands of people are dying because of overdoses of opioids, heroin, and fentanyl. The opioid epidemic has opened our eyes to something else. Narcotics and their problems are not confined to the inner city. They are not confined to people of color, and they are not con-fined to the poor. This opioid epidemic has touched every corner of America in every State. There is no suburb too wealthy, no town so small that it can avoid this opioid epidemic. What it has done, sadly, is educate all of us in what happens with addiction and what we need to do to fight it. We now look at drug addiction not as a moral curse but, rather, as a disease that needs to be treated. That doesn’t mean we should give up on prosecuting kingpins and doing everything we can to stop the flow of narcotics, but we have come to realize that just sticking someone in jail, if they lived long enough to reach that point in their lives, is no guarantee they are going to come out of jail without that addic-tion. We have to be thoughtful. We also have to have rehabilitation that is available for people across the board, whether they are rich or poor. That is something our opioid legisla-tion of several weeks ago moves toward solving. The other thing we have come to un-derstand is, the cost of the current sys-tem is unsustainable. We cannot con-tinue to fill our prisons at great ex-pense and not put money into things that count in terms of protecting our communities. Arresting someone after the crime is, of course, part of a just society, but it doesn’t stop that origi-nal crime from happening. We have to think about the crime prevention that makes our homes and neighborhoods and towns and cities safe all across America, and that was part of the cal-culation last night in this embarkation on a new approach. Finally, I want to say that virtually every major issue that passes on the floor of the U.S. Senate—virtually every single one of them—has someone backing it, pushing for it with a per-sonal passion on the issue. I feel—not personally but having visited so many prisons and worked with so many peo-ple who have served time in those pris-ons—that we need to have a more just system, a more effective system. I want to give credit where it is due. Jared Kushner, President Trump’s son- in-law, spoke to me about his feelings on prison reform the first time we ever met. I know it is personal to him, and I know it means a lot to him and his family. Because he cared and because he mobilized the conservative side of the political equation, we had an amaz-ing vote last night with 87 Members of the Senate supporting the bill. All of the Democrats and then, on top of that, 39 of the Republicans were also sup-portive of the bill. I might add, Senator L
INDSEY GRAHAM was absent. Now that he is back from Afghanistan, he told us he would have made it 88 if he were here. I will close by saying thank you again to Senator G
RASSLEY . Thanks to Aaron Cummings. I thanked him per-sonally last night. He worked so close-ly with Joe Zogby and with Rachel Rossi during the course of this; they really became a team. I think it was one of the reasons we closed this deal and sent it to the House. It is, however, the first step. We have to start think-ing about the second step, and we need the help of all of our colleagues. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Iowa. Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I thank Senator D
URBIN for his kind re-marks—more importantly, for 3 years of working together on this legislation, and it is great that it paid off. 
f 
VICTIMS’ RIGHTS AND CHILD PROTECTION Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I come to the floor to speak about the work of the Senate on victims’ rights and child protection measures and also to highlight the work of Evelyn Fortier, staff member, who has carried such a big burden in these areas of vic-tims’ rights and child protection. During my tenure as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I have made it a top priority to champion bi-partisan initiatives to enhance vic-tims’ rights and to protect our Nation’s at-risk children. In the 115th Congress, as an example, I introduced and led the Senate in approving multiple bills to prevent crime, identify missing chil-dren, enhance services to crime vic-tims, and reform our juvenile justice system. I am proud of what we have achieved on the Judiciary Committee during this period of time, as we sent a half dozen of the measures I just described to the President’s desk after both Chambers passed them, surprisingly, on a unanimous basis. For example, last October, we passed, and the Presi-dent signed, the Elder Abuse Preven-tion and Prosecution Act. This meas-ure, which I sponsored with Senator BLUMENTHAL , increases penalties for the fraudsters who target our senior citizens. It requires Federal agencies to collect more data on financial exploi-tation of the elderly, which is, of course, a terribly underreported crime. It also calls for specialized training of Federal investigators and prosecutors who handle these cases. The second measure, which I intro-duced and the President signed last January, is Kevin and Avonte’s Law. This new law is named in honor of two boys with autism who tragically died after wandering away from their care-giver. It calls for the Justice Depart-ment to award grants to equip school personnel, caregivers, and first re-sponders with training to help identify missing persons with autism or Alz-heimer’s disease. It also permits grant funds to be used for technologies that advance the search for missing children with developmental disabilities. This legislation is important because research suggests that at least one- third of the children with autism re-peatedly wander away from safety. Since 2015, we have seen a doubling in the number of wandering-related deaths, according to SafeMinds, a non-profit organization that advocates for these children. I thank Senators S
CHUMER , TILLIS , and K
LOBUCHAR for joining as cospon-sors of Kevin and Avonte’s Law. Third, I introduced, and both Cham-bers this week cleared, legislation to extend the important victim services programs that the Trafficking Victim Protection Act established. I led our Judiciary Committee in clearing this measure and a com-plementary bill introduced by Senator C
ORNYN . Our bills, which were cospon-sored by Senators Feinstein and Klo-buchar, soon will go to the President’s desk for signatures. Both measures will help us to combat modern human slavery which, unfortu-nately, is alive and well today in this country. It exists in the form of sex

and labor trafficking. Through decep-tion, threats, or violence, the perpetra-tors of these crimes will do whatever it takes to turn a profit and are doing it at the victim’s expense. Fourth, I this year championed legis-lation to renew and extend the Missing Children’s Assistance Act. This meas-ure, which the President signed this fall, makes funds available over the next 5 years for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children to con-tinue to do its important work. The National Center partners with law en-forcement and communities across the United States in the effort to identify and rescue missing and abused chil-dren. The fifth measure I introduced in this Chamber with Senator W
HITE-
HOUSE would renew and update the Ju-venile Justice and Delinquency Preven-tion Act. That law has not been up-dated since 2002. I introduced a measure on this sub-ject for the first time in the 114th Con-gress. This year we concluded our nego-tiations with the House on a final version of this legislation, known as the Juvenile Justice Reform Act. The measure we adopted last week, which is on its way to the President’s desk for signature, reflects the over-sight work that I carried out several years ago. This oversight, which was the subject of a 2015 Judiciary Com-mittee hearing, revealed a flawed grant program but also one worth saving be-cause of its potential benefits for our Nation’s at-risk youth. The reforms that we have adopted also help to ensure the fairer treat-ment of minors in detention through greater screening and treatment of mental illness and substance abuse. This new law also promotes an end to the shackling of girls who give birth in detention. It encourages greater sepa-ration of juveniles and adult offenders in detention, and ensures that detained youth can continue their education. It will give these young people who come into contact with the juvenile justice system a better chance of turning their lives around. I should add that we included ac-countability provisions in virtually every grant funding measure reported by the Judiciary Committee during my 4 years as chairman. The inclusion of this language, which I authored several years ago in statutes authorizing Fed-eral grant programs, will help to en-sure that taxpayers’ dollars are used wisely and, quite frankly, according to law. I want, again, to thank my col-leagues from the Judiciary Committee who joined me as cosponsors of these and other new laws in this area. I also want to thank the nonprofit groups, such as the National Autism Association, the Elder Justice Coali-tion, and the Coalition for Juvenile Justice, as well as individual advo-cates, who include Bob Blancato, Stu-art Spielman, Lisa Wiederlight, Marion Mattingly, and others who contributed in a meaningful way to these laws, their developments, and passage. Once again, I want to thank Evelyn Fortier of my staff for her hard work in these areas. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from California. f 
JUSTICE FOR VICTIMS OF LYNCHING ACT OF 2018 Ms. HARRIS. Madam President, over 2 months ago, the Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously voted to ad-vance the Justice for Victims of Lynching Act of 2018, which I intro-duced proudly with Senators B
OOKER  and S
COTT. This is a historic piece of legislation that would criminalize lynching, attempts to lynch, and con-spiracy to lynch, for the first time in America’s history. Lynching is a part of the dark and despicable aspect of our country’s his-tory that followed slavery and out-rageously continued unabated in our country. According to the Equal Jus-tice Initiative, lynching was used as an instrument of terror and intimidation 4,084 times during the late 19th and 20th centuries. These lynchings were needless and horrendous acts of vio-lence motivated by racism. We must acknowledge that fact, lest it be re-peated. Lynching is a crime committed against innocent people. These crimes should have been prosecuted. There were victims who should have received justice, but they did not. With this bill we are finally able to change that and correct a burden on our history as a country. We finally have a chance to speak the truth about our past and make clear that these hateful acts should never happen again without serious, severe, and swift con-sequence and accountability. From 1882 to 1986, the U.S. Congress failed to pass anti-lynching legislation when it had an opportunity 200 times. We now have an opportunity to pass this bill and to offer some long overdue justice and recognition to the victims of lynching and their families—rec-ognition that these are crimes for which there should be severe con-sequence and accountability. I now yield to my friend, the Senator from the great State of New Jersey, C
ORYBOOKER . The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from New Jersey. Mr. BOOKER. Thank you, Madam President. I want to thank Senator H
ARRIS for her incredible partnership and leader-ship on this bill, and I want to thank Senator T
IMSCOTT of South Carolina for his leadership and for the con-sistent examples of character and in-tegrity they both have shown as my partners on this legislation in this body. As my colleague has said, it has been a very long time coming. For over a century, Members of Congress have at-tempted to pass some version of a bill that would recognize lynching for what it is—a biased, motivated act of terror. Today, Senator HARRIS and I have re-quested that after a century—after 100 years and over 200 bills introduced in this body—we finally make lynching a Federal crime in the United States of America. Thanks to the work of incredible peo-ple around this country—truth tellers such as Brian Stevenson and the Equal Justice Initiative—today, we have a more comprehensive understanding of just how widespread and purposefully lynching was used as a tool of racial terror and oppression in our history. We know that the Equal Justice Ini-tiative was able to document thou-sands of cases—over 4,000 documented cases of racially motivated lynchings between 1877 and 1950. During that time, lynchings were used to terrorize communities. They weren’t only vi-cious acts of murder against individ-uals, but in many cases bodies were hung trying to drive fear into commu-nities to make them submit to second- class citizenship and inconsistent jus-tice. The use of lynching as a larger part of terrorism is disturbing. It is a dark chapter of our past and part of our his-tory. Its legacy doesn’t just live in our history books. Despite activists and or-ganizations that have dedicated them-selves to studying and addressing the racial terror in our history, we have failed to correct for many of those past sins. We know that the passage of this bill will not undo the damage, the terror, and the violence that have been done and the lives that were brutally taken in our past. We do know that the pas-sage of this bill, even though it cannot reverse the irrevocable harm caused by lynching used as terrorist oppression, is a recognition of that dark past. We know that when wrongs are ignored they fester underneath the skin of the body politic, and we know that justice delayed is justice denied. Today, this is a moment of potential justice in this body, a reckoning to the victims of lynching that for too long have been denied. I want to go back to a point in his-tory in this body. The very first bill in-troduced by Congress to address the terror of lynching was by a man on the other side of the Capitol, Congressman George Henry White, in 1900. The year after it was introduced, in 1901, was the last year he would serve in Congress. That is because Congressman White was the very last Black Congressman of the group who had been elected to Congress during Reconstruction. Congressman White’s departure in 1901 would be the last time an African- American Black southerner would serve in Congress for over 70 years. Congressman White must have had an understanding of what was to come with the long dearth of time and the lack of diversity. He knew the terror of

Jim Crow laws and voter disenfran-chisement that would stop the election of African-Americans. In his last speech in this body on January 29, 1901, 1 year after he intro-duced the bill to criminalize lynching, he delivered a farewell address he called ‘‘The Negro’s Temporary Fare-well to the American Congress.’’ In that address to Congress over one century ago, he made the same request that Senator H
ARRIS and I are making right now—for the United States to of-ficially criminalize lynching. Congressman White said: 
Mr. Chairman, permit me to digress for a few moments for the purpose of calling the attention of the House to a bill which I re-gard as important, introduced by me in the early part of the first session of this Con-gress. [It was intended] to give the United States control and entire jurisdiction over all cases of lynching and death by mob violence. During the last session of this Congress I took occasion to address myself in detail to this particular measure, but with all my ef-forts, the bill still sweetly sleeps in the room of the committee to which it was referred. The necessity of legislation along this line is daily being demonstrated. The arena of the lyncher no longer is confined to Southern climes, but is stretching its hydra head over all parts of the Union. 
Referring to the terror of lynching, Congressman White knew that ‘‘the evil peculiar to America, yes, to the United States, must be met, somehow, some day . . . ’’ Well, now in this moment in Amer-ica, we have a chance to make some day today. We have the opportunity to recognize the wrongs of our history, to honor the memories of those brutally killed, and to leave a legacy that fu-ture generations can look back on, knowing that after 200 attempts over the course of 100 years of trying, on this day in American history this body will do the right thing. So I would recognize my colleague from California for the historic calling up of this piece of legislation. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from California. Ms. HARRIS. Madam President, I thank my friend Senator B
OOKER . It is truly an honor to be on the floor of the Senate with my colleague and friend proposing this legislation. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on the Ju-diciary be discharged from further con-sideration of S. 3178 and the Senate proceed to its immediate consider-ation. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title. The bill clerk read as follows: 
A bill (S. 3178) to amend title 18, United States Code, to specify lynching as a depri-vation of civil rights, and for other purposes. 
There being no objection, the com-mittee was discharged and the Senate proceeded to consider the measure. Ms. HARRIS. I further ask unani-mous consent that the substitute amendment be agreed to and that the bill, as amended, be considered read a third time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendment (No. 4168) in the na-ture of a substitute was agreed to. (The amendment is printed in today’s RECORD under ‘‘Text of Amendments.’’) The bill, as amended, was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read the third time. Ms. HARRIS. I know of no further de-bate on the bill. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? Hearing none, and the bill having been read the third time, the question is, Shall the bill pass? The bill (S. 3178), as amended, was passed, as follows: 
S. 3178 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-resentatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Justice for Victims of Lynching Act of 2018’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: (1) The crime of lynching succeeded slav-ery as the ultimate expression of racism in the United States following Reconstruction. (2) Lynching was a widely acknowledged practice in the United States until the mid-dle of the 20th century. (3) Lynching was a crime that occurred throughout the United States, with docu-mented incidents in all but 4 States. (4) At least 4,742 people, predominantly Af-rican Americans, were reported lynched in the United States between 1882 and 1968. (5) Ninety-nine percent of all perpetrators of lynching escaped from punishment by State or local officials. (6) Lynching prompted African Americans to form the National Association for the Ad-vancement of Colored People (referred to in this section as the ‘‘NAACP’’) and prompted members of B’nai B’rith to found the Anti- Defamation League. (7) Mr. Walter White, as a member of the NAACP and later as the executive secretary of the NAACP from 1931 to 1955, meticulously investigated lynchings in the United States and worked tirelessly to end segregation and racialized terror. (8) Nearly 200 anti-lynching bills were in-troduced in Congress during the first half of the 20th century. (9) Between 1890 and 1952, 7 Presidents peti-tioned Congress to end lynching. (10) Between 1920 and 1940, the House of Representatives passed 3 strong anti-lynch-ing measures. (11) Protection against lynching was the minimum and most basic of Federal respon-sibilities, and the Senate considered but failed to enact anti-lynching legislation de-spite repeated requests by civil rights groups, Presidents, and the House of Rep-resentatives to do so. (12) The publication of ‘‘Without Sanc-tuary: Lynching Photography in America’’ helped bring greater awareness and proper recognition of the victims of lynching. (13) Only by coming to terms with history can the United States effectively champion human rights abroad. (14) An apology offered in the spirit of true repentance moves the United States toward reconciliation and may become central to a new understanding, on which improved ra-cial relations can be forged. (15) Having concluded that a reckoning with our own history is the only way the country can effectively champion human rights abroad, 90 Members of the United States Senate agreed to Senate Resolution 39, 109th Congress, on June 13, 2005, to apolo-gize to the victims of lynching and the de-scendants of those victims for the failure of the Senate to enact anti-lynching legisla-tion. (16) The National Memorial for Peace and Justice, which opened to the public in Mont-gomery, Alabama, on April 26, 2018, is the Nation’s first memorial dedicated to the leg-acy of enslaved Black people, people terror-ized by lynching, African Americans humili-ated by racial segregation and Jim Crow, and people of color burdened with contemporary presumptions of guilt and police violence. (17) Notwithstanding the Senate’s apology and the heightened awareness and education about the Nation’s legacy with lynching, it is wholly necessary and appropriate for the Congress to enact legislation, after 100 years of unsuccessful legislative efforts, finally to make lynching a Federal crime. (18) Further, it is the sense of Congress that criminal action by a group increases the likelihood that the criminal object of that group will be successfully attained and de-creases the probability that the individuals involved will depart from their path of crim-inality. Therefore, it is appropriate to speci-fy criminal penalties for the crime of lynch-ing, or any attempt or conspiracy to commit lynching. (19) The United States Senate agreed to unanimously Senate Resolution 118, 115th Congress, on April 5, 2017, ‘‘[c]ondemning hate crime and any other form of racism, re-ligious or ethnic bias, discrimination, incite-ment to violence, or animus targeting a mi-nority in the United States’’ and taking no-tice specifically of Federal Bureau of Inves-tigation statistics demonstrating that ‘‘among single-bias hate crime incidents in the United States, 59.2 percent of victims were targeted due to racial, ethnic, or ances-tral bias, and among those victims, 52.2 per-cent were victims of crimes motivated by the offenders’ anti-Black or anti-African American bias’’. (20) On September 14, 2017, President Don-ald J. Trump signed into law Senate Joint Resolution 49 (Public Law 115–58; 131 Stat. 1149), wherein Congress ‘‘condemn[ed] the racist violence and domestic terrorist attack that took place between August 11 and Au-gust 12, 2017, in Charlottesville, Virginia’’ and ‘‘urg[ed] the President and his adminis-tration to speak out against hate groups that espouse racism, extremism, xenophobia, anti-Semitism, and White supremacy; and use all resources available to the President and the President’s Cabinet to address the growing prevalence of those hate groups in the United States’’. (21) Senate Joint Resolution 49 (Public Law 115–58; 131 Stat. 1149) specifically took notice of ‘‘hundreds of torch-bearing White nationalists, White supremacists, Klansmen, and neo-Nazis [who] chanted racist, anti-Se-mitic, and anti-immigrant slogans and vio-lently engaged with counter-demonstrators on and around the grounds of the University of Virginia in Charlottesville’’ and that these groups ‘‘reportedly are organizing similar events in other cities in the United States and communities everywhere are con-cerned about the growing and open display of hate and violence being perpetrated by those groups’’.

Ms. HARRIS. I ask unanimous con-sent that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Ms. HARRIS. Madam President, I want to thank our colleagues for this incredibly important act of bipartisan-ship in the U.S. Congress. Thank you, Madam President. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from New Jersey. Mr. BOOKER. Madam President, my friend, the Senator from Oregon, just came over. This is a very meaningful moment for this body. There was a speech by a man that I revere. His picture hangs in my office. His name is Martin Luther King. For many people who endured the pain and agony of our past, with lynchings that went on up to the 1970s in this country, and for those people who yearned for justice they would never experience, for those people who know the pain, agony, and hurt in their family’s his-tory and the trauma that is still felt by many people today, who remember lynching in this country that was so pervasive—Dr. King once spoke to those people who were hurting and seeking justice, and he asked at the end of his speech: 
How long? Not long, because ‘‘the truth crushed to the earth will rise again.’’ 
He asked: 
How long? Not long, because ‘‘no lie can live forever.’’ 
He asked: 
How long? Not long, because the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice. 
This has been a long arc, a painful history and shameful history in this body—that at the height of lynchings across this country affecting thousands of people, this body did not act to make it a Federal crime. At least now, the U.S. Senate has acted—100 Sen-ators, no objections. I just want to give gratitude to this body for what we have just done. Thank you. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Oregon. Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I praise my colleagues from the Atlantic coast of New Jersey and Pacific coast of California for today putting our en-tire Senate on record and on a pathway to recognizing the deep darkness of this national scar on our justice sys-tem and on our psyche. Work well done today in the U.S. Senate. Thank you. f 
IMMIGRATION POLICY Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I rise to address a current-day scar, a wound in America—a wound in terms of how we are treating children arriv-ing on our borders and seeking asylum. George Washington said America is a nation open ‘‘to receive not only the opulent and respectable stranger, but the oppressed and persecuted of all na-tions and religions.’’ This sense of the vision of America was repeated 100 years later through Emma Lazarus’s poem that is carved into the foundation of the Statue of Liberty. Phrases of that poem include: ‘‘Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free. . . . Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me,’’ but that spirit is lost right now in the USA. We are a nation almost universally of immigrants, and yet we are treating those children fleeing persecution as if they are criminals when they arrive at our borders. I went down this last weekend with Senator M
AZIE HIRONO of Hawaii and Senator T
INASMITH of Minnesota, with Representative J
UDYCHUof California and Representative B
ETOO’ROURKE of Texas. Four of us visited two family in-ternment camps—one in Dilley and one in Karnes—and all five of us went to the Tornillo child prison in the desert in Texas outside El Paso. This war against children—this Trump war against children—was most dramatically demonstrated back in May and June when the U.S. Govern-ment implemented a ‘‘zero tolerance’’ policy that, in fact, said, if you assert your international rights and come to the border of the United States, we will treat you as a criminal. We will lock you up. We will rip your children out of your arms, and who knows if you will ever see them again. I went down June 3 of this year to shine a light on this and find out what was really going on. I saw children in cages. I tried to enter a facility—a former Walmart—that I was told had hundreds of kids locked up in it. I was denied entry because of the administra-tion’s desires to keep the effects of

their child separation policy secret. There was an outcry from people across America saying the United States does not do this. We do not inflict trauma on children as a direct and deliberate strategy of sending a message to the world that we do not want you, if you are fleeing persecution, to come to our shores. We do not deliberately inflict trauma on children. In addition to the public outcry, there was court action. The adminis-tration agreed and said: OK. We will stop doing child separation. We will quit ripping children out of their par-ents’ arms, but the President said, if we can’t rip children out of their par-ents’ arms, instead, we will lock them up. We will lock them up with their parents—still treating them as crimi-nals as they await asylum here. In fact, the bill to that effect passed the House of Representatives, and 35 Senators in this Chamber signed on to this bill to expand this system of family intern-ment camps at the request of the ad-ministration. I came to this floor. I pointed out the long and shameful history of family in-ternment camps in America, and I pro-posed a different vision. I put forward a bill entitled the No Family Internment Camps in America Act. I noted it would be a fierce fight if those who want to proceed with internment camps at-tempted to do so. This body dropped that effort—stopped that effort. That is good, but the administration is still de-termined to pursue this, and they have been moving funds to people to expand family internment camps in places like Karnes and Dilley. So we went there to look at these family internment camps—one with fathers and sons; one with mothers and daughters. You know, the right thing to do as families await asylum hearings is for them to get that hearing on a timely basis of 6 to 12 months and have them under a Family Case Management Pro-gram of not locking them up in prison. Locking up children in prisons does deep, traumatic damage to these chil-dren, so we must continue to fight this internment camps strategy. The four Members of Congress who were there at Dilley met with a woman. She and her daughter have been locked up in Dilley going on 6 months. Yesterday was the daughter’s 15th birthday. The Quinceanera is a big celebration—if you come from a Latin American tradition—of a young girl be-coming a young woman. We asked the camp: Are you going to recognize this girl’s birthday, this very significant 15th birthday, this quinceanera? No, we can’t do anything special to recognize one child. We said: Well, why not have a policy of recognizing each child on his or her birthday, so you are doing the same for everyone? They said: No, too much trouble. We will have a monthly gathering and list the names of those who had birthdays that month. That will suffice. It is a symbol of the dehumanization with which we are treating people locked up—families we are locking up who have fled persecution and are awaiting an asylum hearing. That young woman is suffering sig-nificantly. We met with her mother. Her mother told us she is not sleeping well, she is not eating well, and she was really depressed over the fact that this very significant day would go un-recognized. We should never be locking up children for long periods of time. There is an agreement—a settle-ment—that said children will not be locked up for more than 20 days. It is called the Flores settlement. It was a settlement that came out of the fact that we recognized that locking up children hurts them, traumatizes them, that it should never happen, and it shouldn’t happen for more than 20 days. Well, it is happening more than 20 days and not just with the mother and her daughter who are locked up there. They fled persecution by a drug gang— a gang that was extorting the family to make payments from their beauty sup-ply business or beauty parlor. When she couldn’t pay, the gang came to her house and assaulted her daughter. She told us they fled the next day. We need to improve the programs with which we are trying to help sta-bilize those countries and help decrease the power of those drug gangs, but, cer-tainly, when those fleeing persecution come here to our shores, let’s treat them with respect and dignity. This is a birthday card that several dozen Members signed yesterday that we are sending to this young woman locked up. The card says: ‘‘Feliz Quinceanera.’’ It is signed inside by dozens of Senators. It says: From your friends in the Senate of the United States. We want her to know—we want every child who is locked up in these child prisons under the Trump war on children to know that we are working to end this war. We went on to Tornillo—the child prison that was initially established to be an emergency shelter for 1 month for 450 children. It has now been ex-tended 3 times, and it has been ex-panded to hold not 450 children but 3,800 children. At this moment, they cranked up the number of people there to 2,700, and they are purposely keeping this as a ‘‘temporary shelter’’ so they can by-pass all the laws related to incarcer-ating children; they can bypass the re-quirements for education; they can by-pass the Flores 20-day standard. I asked: How many children are here over 20 days of these 2,700, a couple of dozen? The director said: No, more than 2,000 of the 2,700 children here are over the 20 days. Then we were told that 1,300 of those children already have a sponsor. They already have the sponsors who have filled out all the paperwork and have done their fingerprints and every-thing. They could be released imme-diately, if the administration would complete the paperwork. He told us that 1,300 children could be in homes and schools and parks in 5 to 7 days from now if the administra-tion would complete the paperwork. We proceeded to hold a press conference, and we said this is unacceptable that the paperwork is not being completed and these children are being locked up here. We held this on Saturday. We said this Tornillo prison camp should be shut down. This is not the spirit of the USA and certainly is not being used as a temporary shelter for 1 month. I have good news to report because yesterday the administration said they are changing the rules. They expect to release several thousand children with-in the next few days—that is the right thing to do—and we may shut down Tornillo. So let’s keep the attention of Amer-ica on this. Let’s keep the spotlight on it. Let’s not let this war on children continue with our money, on our terri-tory, under our government, delib-erately inflicting trauma on children. It must end. The Family Case Management Pro-gram, which was an alternative to locking people up, had a report from the Department of Homeland Security inspector general who said 99 percent of people show up for their check-ins and there was 100 percent attendance at court hearings. There was a closeout report for the program because the ad-ministration shut it down, and the closeout report called the program a success. It said 99.3 percent attendance for court proceedings overall, 99 per-cent compliance with monitoring re-quirements, including check-ins, and it costs $38 a day compared to many hun-dreds of dollars for internment camps or prison camps. Let’s restart a program that made sense—a program that worked. We have seen this series of attacks on chil-dren—child separation, family intern-ment camps, child prison camps. Let’s put America back on track and treat children coming to this country fleeing persecution with respect and dignity as they await their asylum hearings. Thank you. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. C
OT-

GOVERNMENT FUNDING  
Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, we come to the end of what I think has been a very productive conference. I am not happy, as most of us aren’t, with an ending that doesn’t allow us to get all of the principal work of the Congress done, which is to decide how we are going to fund the government, how we are going to spend money. We did—this year for the first time in a long time—get 75 percent of that job done before the beginning of the fiscal year. There is nowhere else in America where that would be a bragging point, but we hadn’t done that in 20 years, and so it is a pretty significant accom-plishment. What we need to figure out is what we did and how we can replicate that in

the future. We have to get to this work. We have to have the kind of floor debates we had this year. We don’t need to let it drag into the end of the year as too many of the bills did this time. The worst possible thing to do, in my view, in terms of funding the govern-ment, is to shut down the government. The next worst possible thing to do is a long-term CR, where you just say: We couldn’t decide how to spend the money this year, so we are going to spend it like we spent it last year. The next option is the one we are fol-lowing, which appears to be a short- term CR to, unfortunately, come back and begin next year’s work with the obligation to finish this year’s work. That is clearly a mistake, and it is a mistake that ends a Congress that oth-erwise was pretty successful. All kinds of regulatory reform oc-curred. Some of it the Congress was in-volved in. For the first time in the his-tory of the Congressional Review Act, the Congress—15 times—sent to the President a regulation that the Con-gress was not going to approve, and, 15 times, the President agreed with that decision. That happened exactly one other time in the 25-year history of the Congressional Review Act. There was one time before this Congress when it had happened 15 times. The regulatory situation of the coun-try is much better. The first major re-write in the tax bill in 31 years has clearly had and is having an impact on our economy. The numbers in my State of Missouri are as good as they have been in a long time. I think our unem-ployment number is at its lowest in 18 years. The national unemployment number is at its lowest in almost 15 years. Missouri’s number, at 3.2 per-cent, is even lower than that. There are things like the long-term extension for the FAA, or the Federal Aviation Ad-ministration, and the farm bill. There are a lot of things that we should be talking about. I want to talk, for just a few min-utes, about the things that have hap-pened for Missouri this year here in the Senate. We have made significant progress in addressing some of the most important issues facing both the State and the Nation. Just this month, we had a land trans-fer for the National Geospatial-Intel-ligence Agency. It started out as an ocean mapping agency in St. Louis, MO, decades ago, and then it became a full partner in our overhead architec-ture that tries to figure out what is going on in the world at any given mo-ment on any given day—things like mapping out what we know about the outside of the place where Osama bin Laden was hiding and where he was eventually found, guessing from watch-ing traffic going in and out of there, what might be on the other side of the door when you go in. That is just one of the things that happens at the Na-tional Geospatial-Intelligence Agency every day. That one and others happened at Next NGA West, the St. Louis facility. There was big competition on what we should do about that. The decision was made to put that $1.3 billion new facil-ity in the city of St. Louis, right next to one of the great Federal disasters of all time. The Pruitt-Igoe housing complex— not well thought out—had to be im-ploded within a short time of people’s moving in there. Within a decade or so, it was known to be a disaster. Not too long after that, it just imploded. That is sort of, again, the implosion of so much of that part of a city that, at one time, was the fourth biggest city in the country in terms of population. It is not there any longer. There are things like the GEOINT workforce—the na-tional geospatial location being there— that will make a difference. Certainly, there is aviation, and we make lots of military aircraft in our State. The bill that we funded that we worried so much about in recent years really brought it back to where we have the multiyear funding of things like the Super Hornet, the Hornet, and the Growler. It just so totally disrupts the efforts of our enemies to figure out what that formation of planes is all about. It is an important part of flying, whether they come off of the deck of a ship or off of a runway or anything else. Boeing won the opportunity to make the Air Force’s T-X trainer, and it is beginning the process right now. The nonmanned tanker is important. Just a few years ago, keeping those lines open in a way that we were con-cerned about wouldn’t have happened. I had the chance this weekend to be a part of the launching of the future Freedom Class ship USS St. Louis. The Navy asked for 32 of those ships, and this Congress gave them 35. Now, if you are listening out there and you are a taxpayer and are thinking about this, well, why would the Congress give them 35 when they asked for 32? We look not just to the immediate need of that line but at the long-term and un-funded need. It hasn’t been that long since the Navy would have asked for 32 ships but might have gotten 18 or 16. We are in a place in which, once again, we are looking at our defense obliga-tions. We also had the biggest pay in-crease for men and women in uniform in over a decade. All of those things matter. Senator M
CCASKILL and I worked on one piece of legislation to allow the historic Delta Queen, which will be based at Kimmswick, MO, which is just south of St. Louis on the Mississippi River, to get back in operation again. It is a 1920s riverboat on which, not too many years ago, President Carter took his summer vacation with the other passengers. The Gateway Arch was reopened. Of-ficially, 60 years after the arch was built, it was time to restore it. It was also time to connect the arch in better and different ways to the city of St. Louis—to the historic courthouse where the Dred Scott decision was started. That is where the local Fed-eral court case was that wound up in a Supreme Court disaster. In the hearts and minds of the people, they are look-ing back at how wrong-headed that particular court was, but that old courthouse is still there. It is now con-nected to the arch, as it was not before, and to downtown. I talked yesterday to the designated person who runs the Park Service. I said that we wanted the second century of the Park Service to be a public-pri-vate partnership. There is no greater example of that than the reopening and the restoring of the arch and in the connecting of it to downtown. There has been 300-and-some million dollars spent. Almost all of that money was ei-ther privately or locally raised with a tax on the city of St. Louis. I think about $20 million of that 300-plus mil-lion-dollar project was Federal high-way money. The message there is that if you are going to expect a different source of money, you also have to expect a dif-ferent kind of partnership. I think one of the things the Park Service learned with that big project was if the second century of the system were going to be different, it can’t be just like the first century. You get your money from somewhere else, and then do whatever you want to do. What happens is you get your money from somewhere else and you have to create a sense that you really have partners in that. In St. Louis, during World War II and after, a lot of the work on atomic weapons was done. In September, Con-gresswoman WAGNER and I were able to join a signing ceremony on a record of decision of what to do with some of that military waste—that radioactive waste that had been left from the years before and after the end of World War II. It had been discarded by the Federal Government in ways that were not well thought out, in the West Lake Landfill. Families there have been tireless ad-vocates in demanding that things be done for the health and safety of their children and their community. They waited for 27 years for some real criti-cism out there by Scott Pruitt, who was the EPA Director. When we first talked to him about this, he said that you can’t be on the priority list for al-most 30 years if it is really a priority list. With his and Administrator Wheeler’s leadership, somehow we came to a conclusion there that has generally been met positively by peo-ple who have worked so hard to get that Federal decision—there is a pub-lic-private partnership—and the pri-vate companies they worked with to do something with this material—to now do the right thing with the material, which means moving it out of our State. In southeast Missouri, there was a port authority, an inland port author-ity. An almost $20 million bridge grant was announced the other day that will allow that inland port, with two new

rail lines, to become much more multi-mobile than it had been before. What is going to happen to rural food demand? It is critically important. No country in the world is better suited than we are to meet the doubling of world food demand between now and 2050. In the doubling of the biggest area of commerce in the world, our inland ports in that discussion become par-ticularly important. Both the Congress and, in this case, the Missouri General Assembly are paying attention to the inland port structure like they have not before. The biggest single piece of contiguous agricultural ground in the world is the Mississippi River Valley. Unlike the others in the world that may be almost as big, it has its own built-in transpor-tation network. The Missouri, the Ohio, the Arkansas, and the Illinois are rivers that flow into the Mississippi River and create that network that now links through the Panama Canal easily. You can go to Asia. You don’t go through the Panama Canal. You easily get to the east coast of our coun-try or you get to Europe and Africa. It is a great opportunity for us, and that kind of investment makes that oppor-tunity more likely to pay the kind of dividends we would hope it would pay. In September of this year, Congress passed and the President signed the Energy and Water appropriations bill, which included $25 million for the Delta Regional Authority, which is an authority designed to benefit a part of our country in which the early focus on labor intensive occupations, particu-larly farming, has given way to looking at that part of our economy without thinking about what has happened to rural communities and the rural work-force as that has moved on. Broadband is part of that, and I think we are going to see that continue to be a big part of what goes on in the future. We have the small ports and the Mis-sissippi River and tributaries project. We have the Ste. Genevieve National Historic Park, and the President signed that bill in March. Ste. Genevieve has French architecture that goes back to the late 1700s and to the very early 1800s. It is unique in the kind of archi-tecture that is preserved there. Some of the oldest buildings, certainly, in the middle of the country and, in some cases, west of the Mississippi are there, and we are moving forward. I hope, even this week, to do a couple of addi-tional things that will make that his-toric park work and be open to people from all over the world. The French Ambassador wants to go there in the near future and see what we are doing, as an example, to maintain those build-ings that are reflective of a different part of our heritage than we have in most of the country. Research institutions, like the Uni-versity of Missouri, the USDA ag re-search facility in Columbia, and other places across our State, have benefited from additional research money. In East Locust Creek, in August of 2018, it was announced that the final investment would be made for an East Locust Creek Reservoir in North Cen-tral Missouri. Water is a bigger and bigger challenge as we look toward the future, and thinking now about how we are going to have the kinds of water opportunities we need for drinking water or agriculture water and other water is very important. In Sedalia, MO, a project to help— Congresswoman H
ARTZLER and I worked on a project to help make the industrial park work better. Nucor just announced this year a significant and brandnew steel facility in that part of our State. In Kansas City, the Buck O’Neil Bridge, across the Missouri River, is something that has needed to be done for a long time. The community had come up with 90 percent of the money needed, a bridge grant that Secretary Chao called me about, that the commu-nity had applied for, gets that last $25 million of that 200-and-some million- dollar project. There has been a long fight at White-man Air Force Base in Warrensburg to maintain the A–10s and then do what we could to get the replacement wing there. That is important, as were the things that happened in Saint Joseph with the lift capacity, the ability with those C–130s, where 19 different coun-tries come to that facility and train to figure out how to get the kind of sup-port we need for military all over the world, including our NATO allies. Senator B
OOZMAN and I, from the days we were in the House together, formed an I–49 caucus. Another an-nouncement just in the last month will allow the last few miles of I–49 to be completed in our State. I was there about 8 years ago when Highway 71 in Missouri became I–49, and in most of our State now it is I–49, and it will be I–49 in all of our State. So what has happened there and what has happened with opioid grant funding and with our mental health leadership in our State have resulted in signifi-cant legislative achievements this year. The HIRE Vets Act is legislation that provides not only for hiring vets, but it also establishes recognition. Ev-erybody says they hire vets. This is fol-lowing up on legislation that was passed here in the Senate and in the House and signed into law in May of 2017. The Labor Department came up with that new standard of acknowl-edging who hires vets and who is better at hiring vets than anybody else. The first five Missouri employers were rec-ognized this year with dozens of em-ployers all over the country, in a tiered situation. It is sort of like the LEED standard for energy efficiency; we now have a standard for hiring vets. As with the FAA reauthorization bill I mentioned earlier, our efforts to move toward more rural broadband have moved significantly this year, but, still, that is one of the things we need to be looking at next year. I would argue that this is certainly one of the most effective right-of-cen-ter Congresses in a long time. I think it has been an effective Congress. We looked at the issues facing the country, and we have done the best we can, in a long- and short-range way, to deal with those issues. It is something we ought to be talking to people we work for about, trying to use that as a standard. We were good this year; let’s figure out how to be even better next year. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from West Virginia. f 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST— S. RES. 734 Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consider-ation of S. Res. 734, submitted earlier today; that the resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the mo-tions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no inter-vening action or debate. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Wyoming. Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, re-serving the right to object, whether you support ObamaCare or oppose it— and I clearly oppose it—it remains the law. The decision in the Texas case is being appealed, and I expect it will eventually end up before the Supreme Court. Regardless of what happens in this legal process, our commitment has al-ways been to protect people with pre-existing conditions. As a doctor and husband of a breast cancer survivor who has had three operations and who has been through chemotherapy twice, I know the importance of making sure that patients can get access to quality healthcare at an affordable cost. Since ObamaCare passed, this has not hap-pened for many families I speak to in Wyoming. They keep telling me that ObamaCare has made their insurance unaffordable, whether it is premiums, copays—all of it. It has made it more difficult to get the care they need. Simply put, they know ObamaCare has failed because they personally have experienced the law’s sky-high pre-miums and few choices. It has taken Washington Democrats a little longer to figure this out. Now they are clamoring for a federally man-dated, single-payer system. They want a healthcare system dominated and controlled by Washington. As a doctor, my focus is on making healthcare better for patients, period. It shouldn’t take a judge to force us to get it done. We need to reform healthcare to give American families better care at a lower cost, which ObamaCare failed to deliver. The question is whether Washington Democrats are interested in solving problems or playing politics. I am ready to work. Therefore, Mr. President, I object. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-tion is heard.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES7848 December 19, 2018 
The Senator from West Virginia. Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I re-spectfully disagree with my friend from Wyoming. First of all, the reason I asked for a live unanimous consent request on my resolution was to pro-tect the 800,000 West Virginians with preexisting conditions, along with mil-lions and millions of Americans. We have tried. We have come to an agreement on how to fix the high cost of third-party and individual payer. It has been lying on the majority leader’s desk for a year with no movement or action. People say that we all have sym-pathy and empathy for people with pre-existing conditions. If you want to pro-tect that, then remove your lawsuit or at least allow us to move forward on a unanimous consent request so that we can fight and have a fighting chance, as this will be appealed to the higher courts. It is absolutely wrong that people who have insurance for the first time, now have the threat of having it taken away from them. As a former Governor, let me tell you how this system works. If you think people are not deserving of insurance or should not be able to have affordable access to insurance, then you are pay-ing anyway, because the people who don’t have that or didn’t have it before go to the emergency room at the high-est cost. They go right to the emer-gency room. They don’t pay. That cost is then distributed on to the Governor, and the Governor of each State has to come up with supplemental payments to keep hospitals and rural clinics open. That is the way the system works. If you work for a company and couldn’t afford the copayment, if you work for a company that didn’t offer insurance—a small company that didn’t have insurance at all—what you would do if you got hurt at home or got sick, you would hobble into work and make a workers’ comp claim. That is the only access to insurance. If you want to go back to those dra-conian days, that is where we are head-ed if this lawsuit succeeds. What we have asked for is simply the ability to fix what we have in front of us. I haven’t supported the single-payer system; we are not talking about a sin-gle-payer system. We are not talking about anything but fixing the existing Affordable Care Act. The President of the United States, Donald Trump, could do this very eas-ily, taking this up. I will be happy to call it Trump RepairCare. I think it would be a fitting name because he can fix it. He can bring us together so that we can basically look at a bipartisan solution to bring down the high cost of premiums. We can also look at a bipar-tisan solution to fix the runaway costs, teaching people how to take care of themselves, keep themselves healthier and be preventive in the care they re-ceive. This resolution allows the Senate and legal counsel to intervene and de-fend West Virginians and Americans with preexisting conditions from this inhumane lawsuit. If you believe in that, there should be no consideration for objections. We should be able to sit down and let the legal staff that we have here in the Senate intervene on our behalf and the people we represent. That is all we have asked for. Millions of Americans with pre-existing conditions have been trusting us to defend their rights. Now they are hearing the political rhetoric. They hear it every day when anybody goes on the campaign trail. The last thing I heard from my colleagues on the Re-publican side—and these are my friends—they said: Oh, yes, J
OE, we want to make sure that people with preexisting conditions have access; they cannot be denied. But guess what the proposal is that they were going to come forward with. It would say simply this: We will make sure insurance companies offer you af-fordable insurance, but, basically, they will not have to protect you or insure you for an existing condition you have had. So we will basically insure your entire body, except for the cancer or the heart condition that you might have had prior to that. That made no sense whatsoever. So they are really not sincere about coming up with allowing people with preexisting conditions to have access to affordable care. That is all we are doing today. Right here and right now we have the opportunity, and we have heard the ob-jection, and I am so sorry for that. We could have done the right thing and di-rectly been involved in defending the lives of Americans. I believe that the Texas judge was wrong in his ruling because we never removed—even those who voted for the tax cuts, and I think a lot of people be-grudgingly did that, looking back on that—but, with that, it said they re-moved the mandate. The mandate did not remove the language of the code of the law. It removed the money from it, but it didn’t take the language away. So I think anybody with any type of background in the legal process under-stands that will not hold up in court. All we have asked for is the right to de-fend the people we represent. So I am very sorry for the decision to object. I really thought that we could get a unanimous consent agreement and move forward, and then, really, you could go out and talk to your con-stituents and say: I truly am fighting to make sure that any of you all who have preexisting conditions—800,000 West Virginians who have a preexisting condition—will have affordable access and cannot be denied and cannot be overcharged. That is all. Give them a chance. I don’t know where you come from, but where I come from, before we had any access to healthcare, before there was a law that forbade insurance com-panies to charge outrageous prices or cut people off to say that, basically, you have hit your cap and you are no longer able to be insured—you are too sick for us to invest any more into you—they would say: I don’t want to be a burden to my family. What a person is telling you, if they have a preexisting condition is this: I don’t want to be a burden to my family because I don’t want to put them in a position that would be absolutely ruin-ous for them, put them in bankruptcy; one of my illnesses could put my fam-ily in bankruptcy because I cannot buy nor will the insurance company sell me insurance, nor can I afford what they want for it. That is what we did away with, and that is where we are going back. We want to intervene so we do not go back to those dark ages. With that, I hope my friends on the Republican side will reconsider this, and, as a body, let this move forward to protect the people of America. With that, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Pennsylvania. Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise to join in the remarks of the Senator from West Virginia, who worked very hard to make sure we had a resolution that would allow us to direct the Sen-ate legal counsel to intervene in the lawsuit. Of course, the lawsuit is beyond the district court. We await what might happen in an appellate court. But the best way for anyone in this body to ex-press their disagreement with the re-moval of the protections for those who might have a preexisting condition, if you believe that those protections should remain the law of the land as they are now, then you should, as a Member of the House or the Senate— even if you wanted to be in favor and voted in favor of repealing the Afford-able Care Act, you could still argue that in the interest of preserving those protections, without question, in the interest of providing certainty to not just tens of millions of Americans but many millions more than that who have these protections in law right now—did not have those protections before the Affordable Care Act—if that is what you believe, you could very easily say: Let’s preserve them and make a different argument in this court case, file a brief, and try to inter-vene, as you could in this case. But for some reason around here, some people think they can have it both ways. They do television ads and campaigns or give speeches back home saying: Oh, don’t worry, I want to pro-tect and I want to preserve the protec-tions for preexisting conditions, but at the same time do nothing about it. There is no third way here. You are either in favor of those protections, maintaining in law the protections for those who have a preexisting condition, or you are not. You are either for that or you are not. If you are for it, I think you are dutybound to take action to preserve it. Right now, these protections are at risk. They will be in greater jeopardy if

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S7849 December 19, 2018 
an appellate court were to agree with the district court. So I think folks here have to make a decision: You are ei-ther for maintaining these protections, which carries with it a responsibility to take action to make sure that those protections are in law—are kept in law, remain a part of our law—or you have to go to the other side, which is you throw up your hands and say: Either I am not for those protections or I am not going to do anything about it. So you have to take action or not. I think that is true of people in both par-ties and both Chambers, but when you consider what is at stake in a State like Pennsylvania, we have a huge por-tion of our population—more than 3 million people—who live in rural com-munities. With 67 counties in Pennsyl-vania, 48 of them are rural. A couple years after the Affordable Care Act passed we saw in Pennsyl-vania—this is only maybe 2 years ago now, and I am sure the numbers haven’t changed that much—we had about 280,000 people who got their healthcare through the Affordable Care Act but lived in those 48 rural counties. Of the roughly 280,000 who got cov-erage, 180,000 were in rural commu-nities. Lots of folks in rural areas are worried about the protections they got because they were benefited by Med-icaid expansion, and the balance of those got their healthcare through the exchanges. If you are in a rural community and you got healthcare most recently through the exchanges or even if you had healthcare prior to 2010 or prior to the last several years, you have protec-tions that you didn’t have before. Of course, in rural communities in Penn-sylvania, you have even higher inci-dents in many cases of those who have an opioid problem. These healthcare decisions, these healthcare votes that we cast, these healthcare court cases have even greater significance in rural communities—whether it is preexisting condition protections, whether it is having the coverage of Medicaid that allows you to get treatment and serv-ices for an opioid problem, or whether you are just dependent on healthcare because of your own health or that of a family member, especially children. I would just make a couple more points because I know we are limited in time. Here is some data on the impact of the Affordable Care Act and what could happen in some communities in a State like Pennsylvania that have a high significant rural population. We are told in one study that since 2010, 83 percent of rural hospitals have closed, and 90 percent of these rural hospitals that closed have been in States that have not—or have not as of that time period—expanded Medicaid when the hospital closed. So we are talking about a court case that would, in essence, invalidate the Affordable Care Act. We are talking about not just healthcare loss or coverage loss in a rural community, we are talking about job loss and devastation. In our State, we have something on the order of 25 rural counties where the No. 1 or No. 2 employer is a hospital. If that hospital is badly undermined, if they can’t make the margins work be-cause of cuts to Medicaid or the elimi-nation of Medicaid expansion, as some around here want to do—not just cut it but eliminate it—you are going to have economic devastation in those commu-nities in addition to healthcare devas-tation. The staff of the Joint Economic Com-mittee has estimated that if the Af-fordable Care Act were struck down, which is the effect of this Federal court case of just last week, 17 million people would lose coverage next year—17 mil-lion people in just 1 year. What we should be doing around here, in addition to urging a court—or any court—not to strike it down, is to have bipartisan hearings for a long time on lots of ideas. We need at least weeks of that, if not longer. If there is one area or one place of consensus around here, it is that healthcare costs for too many Americans are too high. We have to get costs down, and people in both parties have a lot of work to do on that. The second thing we hear back home and across the country is prescription drug costs especially are too high for too many families. Neither party has done enough on that issue. We have to get those down as well. If we focus on the priorities of most Americans, which is not repealing this law; it is not throwing out or ending Medicaid expansion, which helps with the opioid crisis and helps a lot of our rural communities especially—what we would do is focus on the priorities of the American people: get the cost of healthcare down, get the cost of pre-scription drug costs down, and deal with any other issues that have been brought to the table for those who care about improving our healthcare sys-tem. If the American people see only a battle about one side wanting repeal and the other side working every day to try to stop that, we are not going to advance very far on their agenda. Their agenda is not that fight. Their agenda is to protect the gains we have, make sure people don’t lose coverage, and make sure a much larger portion of the population—virtually everyone you know—doesn’t lose protections that were put into law a couple of years ago. If we do that and focus on those pri-orities, I think the American people will believe we are beginning to do our job in both parties on healthcare. The worst thing we can do is go back to the days when someone with a preexisting condition was denied coverage or was charged a higher rate because of that preexisting condition. We don’t want to go back to those dark days. We should insist that we never reverse course on this issue. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Arizona. UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST— S. 2644 Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to immediate consideration of Calendar No. 393, S. 2644. I further ask that the committee-reported substitute amendment be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be considered read a third time and passed, and that the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Mr. M
CCONNELL. I object. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-tion is heard. The Senator from Arizona. Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I rise for the third time in the past 2 months to defend the integrity of our political process by defending the ongoing inves-tigation led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller. The continuity of this investigation is critical to upholding public trust in our institutions of government due both to the substance of the investiga-tion, the extent to which a foreign gov-ernment was able to interfere in our political process, and the principle that no person—no person, no matter how high the rank—is above the law. The investigation has produced re-sults already, including the indictment of more than 12 Russian nationals for interference in the 2016 elections. It has also led to much knowledge about what was going on during the period of 2016 and beyond with regard to individ-uals in the United States. We need to protect the independence of the special counsel and allow this crucial inves-tigation, and any like it in the future, to run their course. This particular bill, S. 2644, Special Counsel Independence and Integrity Act, was approved by a bipartisan vote of 2 to 1 in the Judiciary Committee— 14 to 7. We don’t have many votes like that, the Senator from New Jersey will attest, in the Judiciary Committee. It has awaited a floor vote ever since. That is 9 months—9 months without a vote on this bipartisan bill that came out of the Judiciary Committee. I just asked a moment ago for unani-mous consent to pass this legislation. It was objected to for the third time. I know some of my Republican col-leagues have some sincere objections to this bill. Some of them believe a President must be able to fire anyone within the executive branch, at any time, since the President is the head of it. I understand the constitutional ar-guments. I know some of my colleagues hold them sincerely. I would respond that, if this bill becomes law, the President still has a key role in over-seeing the process. There is account-ability to him. The Constitution re-quires that there must be. Under this act, the Attorney General would still oversee the investigation and still be able to remove the special counsel for good cause. So the special counsel would not be fully insulated

from Presidential control. The Attor-ney General who oversees the special counsel still answers to the President. This legislation simply adds one layer of protection to the special counsel and makes his removal renewable, to make sure it is for sufficient cause, and it maintains a significant degree of Presi-dential control while protecting the special counsel investigations from being terminated by a President who might feel that he or she is under in-creasing heat. This bipartisan request today is timely and necessary. Just last month, after the midterm elections—for those of my colleagues who said throughout the year nobody is being fired, don’t worry, nothing to see here—the day after the midterm elections, the Presi-dent forced his Attorney General to re-sign after numerous public comments from the President that the AG should not have recused himself from the in-vestigation even though he was a key player in the 2016 campaign. It is clear we need to put these pro-tections in place and send this signal to the President. Nobody is above the law. The truth must be told, whatever it is. I thank my colleagues on the Judici-ary Committee, particularly Senator C
OONS and Senator B OOKER , for pushing this legislation and for insisting that it be considered on the Senate floor and for being here today again. With that, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Delaware. Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I am proud to once again join the Senators from Arizona and New Jersey on the floor to ask for a vote on the Special Counsel Independence and Integrity Act. We have come three times now to ask for a vote—just a vote—on this bipar-tisan legislation to protect the special counsel and support the rule of law, a bill which passed the Senate Judiciary Committee by a vote of 14 to 7, includ-ing with the support of Chairman G
RASSLEY , to be considered on the floor. Each time we have come here, there has been an objection from a Repub-lican colleague. Each time, we have heard a reason or an excuse—some-thing like: This legislation just isn’t needed. The President is not immi-nently going to fire the special counsel. To those who believe this bill is still unnecessary, I could give a thorough survey of the landscape of recent days, but let me simply summarize. There have been a whole series of fil-ings and actions and developments in the Mueller investigation that have made clear that the President or his National Security Advisor or his per-sonal attorney lied to the FBI or lied to the American people, misrepre-sented the scope and depth of the President’s business contacts in Russia during the campaign or misrepresented to the FBI ongoing contacts with Rus-sians. This is an effective and ongoing Federal investigation that must be al-lowed to reach its conclusion. Meanwhile, the President continues to spread misinformation and under-mine the investigation into Russian at-tacks on our election. He recently sug-gested, with no evidence, that the spe-cial counsel and his team are bullying witnesses into lying about collusion, tweeting, the ‘‘Angry Mueller Gang of Dems is viciously telling witnesses to lie about facts & they will get relief.’’ I know many of us have begun to shrug our shoulders at the President’s tweets, ignoring the ways in which his messages publicly undermine the rule of law or discredit and attack Federal prosecutors. I know some Members of this body have proved willing to dis-miss each new piece of information the special counsel uncovers as if it is no big deal. Folks, this is not politics as usual. This is not something we should be sweeping under the rug. This is about the integrity of our democracy, our na-tional security, and the President of the United States. It is critical that this body dem-onstrate our ability to come together in a mature and responsible bipartisan way to do something about it—not to sit by and watch a potential constitu-tional crisis barreling toward us and refuse to step up and act. Our job as Members of the Senate, sworn to uphold the Constitution, is to take reasonable, responsible, preven-tive action to avoid this sort of crisis that we can see coming. I am so grate-ful to my colleagues, both Republicans and Democrats—Senators GRAHAM , T
ILLIS , BOOKER , GRASSLEY , FEINSTEIN , and F
LAKE —who have worked to craft this bill, to get it a hearing, to get it a vote, and to get it to the floor. Yet I am so frustrated with those who con-tinue to block the last step, a vote on the floor. Just last night, we saw the broadest possible coalition of Senators—from Senator B
OOKER and Senator L EEto Senator D
URBIN , Senator G RAHAM , and Senator G
RASSLEY —come to this floor and lead a successful final vote on criminal justice reform. If we can do that, overcoming decades of divisive politics on race and criminal justice, why can’t we do this? This cannot wait. The moment to act is now. The Amer-ican people deserve an explanation as to why we can’t act on this most im-portant point. Mr. President, before I yield the floor to my colleague of New Jersey, I want to conclude with a few words about my colleague and my friend J
EFFFLAKE . When we look back at the history of this time, with the hindsight of his-tory, it is my hope and it is my belief that Senator F
LAKE will be recognized as someone who put country over party at a moment when it mattered. He fol-lows a long line of Republicans whose mettle has been tested by the turmoil of their times—names I was raised on, such as Wendell Willkie, the Repub-lican’s nominee for President, who agreed to support President Roo-sevelt’s controversial plan to send aid to Britain at a turning point in World War II, even though it was the height of a Presidential campaign. Without his support, the plan would have failed. FDR called him a godsend to our coun-try. Margaret Chase Smith, of Maine, stood up to Joe McCarthy in 1950, a decade later. When she issued her ‘‘Declaration of Conscience,’’ she was just a freshman. Last, Barry Goldwater, also from Ar-izona, along with Republican leaders went to the White House in August of 1974 to make it clear to the President that he had lost their support and needed to resign. I am a proud Democrat, but I know that no party has a monopoly on cour-age or conscience. Our system only works when Members of both parties take risks for the good of us all. I have been deeply blessed to serve alongside and to work with Senator FLAKE . It is my hope that his example will inspire others in the Congress ahead to come together and to meet the demands of our time—protecting the rule of law, protecting the investigation of the spe-cial counsel. Taking up and passing this law is exactly one of those de-mands on which he has stood up and for which I am grateful for his leadership. With that, I yield to my colleague from New Jersey. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from New Jersey. Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I want to give a lot of gratitude to my col-league, Senator C
OONS of Delaware. He is not only with us today on this call for a vote on a bill that was voted out of this Judiciary Committee in a bipar-tisan manner, but he is also a cospon-sor of this legislation and somebody I have been proud to work with. I want to thank my colleague J
EFF F
LAKE for putting himself so far out there in pushing for this legislation. It is a consistent pattern with J
EFF F
LAKE . If you know him, you might know that he and I might disagree on a lot of policy, but he is one of the people I have looked up to in the U.S. Senate as someone who understands the role of Congress, the article I branch of gov-ernment—that the powers of Congress articulated by the Constitution should be seen as sacrosanct, and that the ero-sion of these powers or the surren-dering of these powers to the executive undermines the very ideals of our Con-stitution that our government should be one of checks and balances on power. I have seen him step forward and lead in the manner he is showing today. I have seen him step forward when it came to war powers and talking about the authorization of the use of military force and speak forcefully in a bipar-tisan manner with another of my col-leagues, T
IMKAINE, in saying: Hey, we have to have a system of checks and balances or the very foundations of this Republic begin to be undermined.

If you know his character, you know he is on the Senate floor because of his deep belief in this Nation, not just today but for the tomorrows to come, and that we must maintain healthy checks and balances on Executive power and within our system of govern-ment. I am grateful for him to come in his final hours as a U.S. Senator still push-ing this idea that there should be checks and balances, pushing this idea that there is a bipartisan space to try to preserve the ideals of this Republic, pushing this idea that no one—not a U.S. Senator, not a Congressperson, not even a President—is above the laws of this land because in the United States of America, we believe in the rule of law. More than this, we talk about the Framers, but every generation of peo-ple who are in these seats in many ways are stewards of this Republic. What I respect about my colleague from Arizona is that he takes that seri-ously. Something from past Members in history who have understood that is that you need to not only make deci-sions for today but you need to plan for tomorrow. It is an axiom that I know all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle believe: It is better to be pre-pared for a crisis and not have one than have a crisis and not be prepared. I am one to believe that we are com-ing perilously close to the precipice of our Nation having a constitutional cri-sis. There is an investigation going on that is not a political attack. It is not a witch hunt—whatever may be seen. We already have seen this investiga-tion through a consensus of our intel-ligence community that is inves-tigating an attack on our Nation. It is something that people from both par-ties have spoken about—the impor-tance of having an independent inves-tigation. It is something that an ap-pointee of the President, Jeff Sessions, has said we need to make sure the in-vestigation is independent and beyond reproach. That investigation has already yield-ed many indictments. It has yielded guilty pleas, and that investigation should be able to continue. There are some people who say: Hey, there is no threat to that investigation, but I am a big believer that if someone shows you who they are or tells you who they are, believe them. We have a President right now who is attacking this investigation—the very legitimacy of this investigation—and he is acting like someone who believes this investigation shouldn’t be going on at all. I believe that it may not hap-pen, and we may not end up with a con-stitutional crisis, but if one comes, we should be prepared. How are we to be prepared? Not by some partisan radical idea, but by a very sobered measured step that is em-bodied in the legislation that we are calling for right now—to have a modest check and balance on a President’s power to end an investigation and dis-miss the special counsel. That is what this is all about. It is a modest step of judicial review that could prevent not just a crisis that might happen next month or next year but 20 years from now, 30 years from now, 50 years from now. It is in line with what this body has done in the past of providing a check and balance on Executive power. We have called yet again, for the third time, for a vote, and a third time we have not been granted a vote on the Senate floor or granted unanimous consent. I am grateful to be standing with my colleagues for the third time. My hope is that in the fashion we have seen on this floor of recent, that we can work together to ensure we have a check and balance on Presidential power, to en-sure the ideal of this Nation of equal justice for all, and to ensure that we can have a country where no one is above the law. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Arizona. Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, to con-clude, I thank my colleagues for their kind words. I thank them for taking their jobs seriously and that they would continue to do this. I say to our President: This is not a witch hunt. Russia attempted to inter-fere in our elections, and they will con-tinue to make that attempt. We are seeking truth here, and that is what the special counsel is doing, and he needs to be protected. We need to be better prepared for future elec-tions. That is what this is about. As the Senator from New Jersey just said, this is based on the principle that no one—no one, however high and mighty, whatever position they hold— is above the law. With that, I yield back. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO CLAIRE M CCASKILL Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I re-turn to the floor to conclude saying good-bye to Members of our caucus who will not be returning to this Chamber next year. Last, but certainly not least, to me and to so many of us, is my dear, dear friend, the Senator from Missouri—as she says it—C
LAIRE  M
CCASKILL . It should come as no surprise to any-one that the Senator from Missouri found her way into politics. She got her start early. Growing up in a family that was actively involved in govern-ment and politics, C
LAIRE was not given the option to avoid subjects of national debate. When C
LAIRE was 7 years old, she was sent door to door on Halloween, saying: Trick or treat; vote for JFK. Soon, politics wasn’t just a passion passed down but a passion of her own. In high school, C
LAIRE launched a stealth campaign to become home-coming queen. In the tradition of her school, the football team picked the winner. So CLAIRE befriended all the linemen—doing small favors, arranging dates—knowing there would be more of them than any other position. Guess what. She won, not because she skated by on popularity—although she was al-ways popular—but because she put in the work. She was tenacious and tac-tical, qualities she would take from high school politics into the politics of the wider and older world. That is how, as a Democrat in a State already becoming more conserv-ative during her youth, C
LAIRE would go on to represent Missouri at nearly every level of government. As a pros-ecutor, in the State house, as State auditor, and, eventually, for 12 amaz-ingly wonderful and productive years as Senator. I was chair of the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee in 2005. C
LAIRE  was just coming off a difficult loss in the Governor’s race, after which she ‘‘drank a lot of red wine and ate too many cookies,’’ by her own typical frank admission. I had heard so much about her that I flew to London to meet with C
LAIRE and her dear husband Joe about a possible Senate race. Al-most immediately, I was struck by the force of her personality. She is a whirlwind. As C
LAIRE ’s mother, Betty Anne, said of her, ‘‘In-tegrity, independence, and guts—that’s what C
LAIRE MCCASKILL is made of.’’ Everyone who meets C
LAIRE can see that from the get-go. By the end of din-ner, I was so eager for C
LAIRE to run that I did something I almost never do. I paid for dinner. I have never been more glad that I did because C
LAIRE be-came an exceptional Senator and one of my closest friends, not just here in the Senate but in life. A moderate at heart, C
LAIRE had a knack for finding compromise between our two parties— a theme among many of our departing Members. She worked across the aisle with Senator C
OLLINS to protect seniors from financial scams. She worked to fight for victims of opioid addiction, working with Republicans on taking on the big pharmaceutical companies that were funneling money to organizations to promote their own dangerous prod-ucts. In the tradition of her political idol, Harry Truman, she took a seat on the Armed Services Committee and fought fiercely for our veterans and our mili-tary. Her hearings on the waste, fraud, and abuse of military contractors ushered in long-overdue reforms to military contracting, increasing transparency and accountability. Almost every issue that C
LAIRE got her teeth into, she never let go and al-ways succeeded. She was amazing as a Senator. Of course, C
LAIRE wasn’t just prag-matic. One of the reasons we love her is that she is both pragmatic and prin-cipled and combines those two in a unique way. I will never forget the vote on the Dreamers. C
LAIRE was seated in a seat

back there. She was a more junior Member. She knew that voting to bring the Dreamers home—a pathway to citi-zenship and living here in America— could mean the end of her election. She said that to me. But she said: I cannot vote against them. And we walked down the aisle together, tears stream-ing down her cheeks, and, of course, she voted yes. The Senate has its fair share of dealmakers. It has its fair share of principled fighters as well. But rarely, rarely, rarely is a Senator so adept at both. That is our C
LAIRE MCCASKILL . We will miss far more, of course, than C
LAIRE the Senator. So many of us will miss C
LAIRE the person. When she has something to say to you, she does not hold back. Believe me—I know. I have been called just about every name in the book by C
LAIRE  M
CCASKILL , and each time, it rang true, but I didn’t mind it because I know it was done with both affection and a desire to make me better and do a better job. And I can say this: What-ever job I am doing here as leader is in significant part because of C
LAIRE  M
CCASKILL ’s loving but pointed criti-cisms. I will miss them so much. She is amazing. I am not the only one she criticized, and I am not the only one she criticized using the words that came right to her mouth. They say they used to keep a swear jar on her desk in the Missouri Legislature. I would be surprised if they didn’t keep a few lined up along the whole desk. But as much as C
LAIRE can some-times criticize you in a pointed way, she can also make you laugh. She said her father insisted on two things: that she learn the rules of football and how to tell a good joke. That, she did. And more than that, she can tell a good joke at her own expense. That is just one of many reasons she was so well liked in this Chamber by Democrats and Republicans. It is rare you can find someone who speaks her mind so directly and yet be so loved. That is one of the many uniquenesses of this wonderful lady, C
LAIRE MCCASKILL . And I am not the only one who felt that way. After a farewell address in this Chamber, the line of Senators to say a few words about C
LAIRE was long, and it wasn’t just on our side of the aisle. I could go on about Senator M
CCAS-
KILL for quite a while, but I am sure she is already telling me that I am get-ting longwinded. So let me close with this: When C
LAIRE was 9 years old, her father took her to the annual Jackson Day dinner in Springfield, MO, to hear the big political speeches on offer that year. After all, this was a famous venue that had hosted the giants of American politics—William Jennings Bryan, Harry Truman, JFK. Well, guess who delivered the closing address at the Jackson Day dinner this year. C
LAIRE MCCASKILL , whose impact on her State and her country, as well as on the Senate and on so many of us, belongs in the same category as those distinguished names and will live on just as long. CLAIRE , we are going to miss you so. I will, the Senate will, Missouri will, and America will. I wish you and Joe and your wonderful family all the hap-piness in your next endeavors. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Arizona.

LETTER OF RESIGNATION Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I am in-formed that it is necessary for me to insert into the R
ECORD of the pro-ceedings the resignation letter that I sent to Governor Doug Ducey of Ari-zona on December 12, 2018; therefore, I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the R
ECORD at this point. There being no objection, the mate-rial was ordered to be printed in the R
ECORD , as follows: 
U.S. S ENATE , December 12, 2018. Hon. D
OUGDUCEY , Governor of the State of Arizona, Phoenix, Arizona. D
EAR GOVERNOR DUCEY : Thank you again for appointing me to the U.S. Senate to fill the vacancy created by John McCain’s death. It has been an honor and a privilege to again serve the people of Arizona. When I accepted your appointment, I agreed to complete the work of the 115th Congress and then reevaluate continuing to serve. I have concluded that it would be best if I resign so that your new appointee can begin the new term with all other Senators in January 2019 and can serve a full two (po-tentially four) years. Therefore, I will resign from the U.S. Sen-ate effective 11:59 pm EST December 31, 2018. Respectfully, J
ONKYL, United States Senator. f 
REMEMBERING JOHN M CCAIN Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the other thing I would like to do this afternoon is to very briefly report to my col-leagues and to constituents back home on some things which my predecessor, Senator McCain, was working on at the time of his untimely death and which his staff and I have continued to work on and, in several cases, have brought to successful conclusion. I want people to know about these items and what we have been able to accomplish. I first want to thank the members of his staff who wanted to stay in the service of the government and the State of Arizona and were willing to take a position in my office, as a result of which, we were able to really have a seamless transition from some of the things Senator McCain was working on and my ability to continue to do so. One of the first things of which I was aware but not really aware of the depth that he had taken it is a new relation-ship in the State of Arizona among the three pillars representing the defense establishment in our country and spe-cifically in the State of Arizona. These are, first of all, our military installa-tions—Arizona is blessed to have a lot of military installations; secondly, the defense industries—again, Arizona is the home to many important defense industries serving all of our branches of the military; and finally, the com-munities that support both of those elements of our establishment. As a result, I had the opportunity to meet throughout the State with the groups that Senator McCain had helped to nurture and to create—in particular, a group in Tucson and Southern Ari-zona, including Yuma, called the Southern Arizona Defense Alliance; in Flagstaff and Northern Arizona, the Northern Arizona Military Affairs Council; and in Central Arizona, Mari-copa County and the Phoenix environs, the Mesa Industry and Defense Council. Meeting with the representatives of all three components of our military society and hearing about the suc-cesses they had in working with each other and in providing a real synergy that benefited them all just reminded me again of how important Senator McCain’s leadership was to the State of Arizona and to our national security. I wanted to mention that today and to let everyone know that I will be passing on to my successor the advice that these councils continue to need to be supported and nurtured by the Sen-ators from the State of Arizona, as well as the Members of the House of Rep-resentatives. A second thing that John McCain was involved in as part of his activities as chairman of the Senate Armed Serv-ices Committee was the creation—a couple years ago—in the Defense au-thorization bill of a national commis-sion to advise the Secretary of Defense on the strategy for the United States and to report back to Congress—and specifically the Armed Services Com-mittee—on their conclusions. This bill created the National De-fense Strategy Commission, comprised of 12 members, 3 of whom were ap-pointed by the chairman and the rank-ing member—each—of the Senate Armed Services Committee and the House Armed Services Committee. I was privileged to have been ap-pointed by Senator McCain to serve on that Commission, and I did for approxi-mately a year. My service there ended as we finished our report. Before it was signed, while it was still being edited, he passed away, and I was appointed to serve in his stead. So I have had the unique opportunity to both help write the report and then be a member of the Armed Services Committee, on which he sat, to receive the report and to question the cochairmen of that Com-mission, Ambassador Eric Edelman and ADM Gary Roughead, Retired. I think the importance of this Com-mission report reflects what Senator McCain hoped to achieve, and that is a bipartisan consensus, a unanimous re-port which provides advice to the Sec-retary of Defense and will provide ad-vice to both the House and the Senate. As I said, there has already been a hearing before the Senate Armed Serv-ices Committee, and I know the House

committee is going to invite members of the Commission to brief it as well. It is my hope that the recommenda-tions of this bipartisan Commission will be followed by the Congress and by the President and the Secretary of De-fense because I think they represent some very strong conclusions about what is necessary to enhance our na-tional security. A third thing Senator McCain wanted to do as chairman of the Armed Serv-ices Committee was to hold a series of hearings or briefings before the com-mittee that focused on the advances in technology that were having and can have an important impact on our na-tional security—in many cases, on the kinds of things that we acquire in sup-port of our military superiority, things like hypersonics and artificial intel-ligence, super-advanced computing, cyber technology, and the like. After speaking with the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee now, Senator I
NHOFE , it is my under-standing that he, in fact, has a plan to carry out this legacy of Senator McCain and hold a series of briefings early next year on all of these techno-logical issues so that our Members will be better able to evaluate the kinds of things that will help our military have superiority in the future. I am happy to have had some small part to play in advancing that. There were a couple of other more specific things that Senator McCain didn’t work on but which bear his name that I wanted to mention. One, I cosponsored and helped secure passage of S. 2827, which was a bill to reauthorize the Morris K. Udall and Stewart L. Udall Foundation at the University of Arizona. This was some-thing that Senator McCain helped to create and to foster throughout his ca-reer. But I am also pleased to announce that this legislation names the founda-tion’s environmental conflict resolu-tion center after the late Senator John McCain. I am pleased to make that an-nouncement here. There is one other item that we are continuing to try to accomplish in Sen-ator McCain’s name. We are not across the finish line yet, but we hope to get there. That is something called the 21st Century Conservation Service Corps Act, S. 1403. This bill carries the name of Senator McCain, and it was one of his favorite projects. It expands vol-unteerism in our national parks and public lands. I can tell you that while John McCain came to Arizona having lived in many other places of the world and in the United States, primarily as a re-sult of his service in the Navy, he ac-quired a love for the State of Arizona which is unequalled among all of us who have been there for a very long time. He loved the beauty of the State, the ruggedness of it, the incredible va-riety in the flora and fauna. When I would visit John and Cindy’s home in the Sedona area, I could always count on being taken on a hike around the perimeter of the property to show me all of the interesting things he had dis-covered over the last several months, including where the hawks live and where the owls live and where they found the rattlesnakes and all of the other things that pleased him to be a part of that environment. So we are hopeful that we can get this Service Corps Act passed, if not in the latter part of this session, at least perhaps early next year. I want my colleagues to know that although Senator McCain passed away in the early part of his Senate term, he was working on a lot of things that his staff and I wanted to continue to move forward, and I am just pleased we have been able to move these items forward and wanted my colleagues to appre-ciate that, as well as his friends and constituents in the State of Arizona. I thank my colleagues here who helped to make some of these things possible and urge that they continue to focus on the one item of unfinished business that can perhaps be accom-plished next year. I conclude by thanking the Governor of the State of Arizona for appointing me to serve for part of the remainder of Senator McCain’s term. It has been a great honor and privilege for me to again serve the people of the State of Arizona, particularly to succeed my friend and colleague John McCain. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Virginia. Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am going to be here on another matter in a moment, but I wanted to add my thanks to the great work that Senator K
YLhas done. I remember coming here as a fresh-man Senator in early 2009, and J
ONKYL was one of the people who was kind enough to take me in. We didn’t always agree. I still remember a very famous battle over slots at National Airport. But J
ONKYLhas always been someone I have enormous respect for. I think Senators on both sides of the aisle have respect for him, and we very much ap-preciate his willingness to come back into service, fulfilling part of the ten-ure of his dear friend, Senator McCain. I know enough about J
ONKYLto know that, shall I say, his livelihood prior to coming back into the Senate was quite good, and his willingness to give that up to serve Arizona and the country is a real tribute to the indi-vidual and the patriot he is. We will all miss him, and I wish him all the best going forward. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from North Carolina. Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I want to add my thanks to my colleague from Arizona. I came to speak on something else, and I will say this: If there is one individual I have tried to emulate since the day I came to the U.S. Senate, it has been J
ONKYL. He represented Ari-zona well, but, more importantly, he represented the Kyl name well. J
ON, I am grateful that you would come back for this short period. Godspeed as you leave. f 
NOMINATION OF WILLIAM R. EVANINA Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I rise today—and it was my intent to ask unanimous consent with my colleague, the vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee—for the Senate to confirm Bill Evanina as Director of the Na-tional Counterintelligence and Secu-rity Center. Bill has served our Nation for over 23 years, including service as a super-visory special agent and assistant sec-tion chief with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Prior to joining the NCSC, Bill served as the chief of coun-terespionage at the CIA. Bill has served honorably as the Di-rector of the NSC since June of 2014, before the position required Senate confirmation, necessitating a vote by the U.S. Senate. Here is a guy who has served for 3
1⁄2years, and we changed the statute and said that this is a posi-tion that the Senate needs to confirm in the future, and, all of a sudden, the same guy who has been there is now being held up. Intelligence threats facing our Na-tion are numerous. They are growing, and they are significant. Bill is experi-enced, professional, and understands the threats through real world experi-ence. We need a Director who can ably lead our Nation’s counterintelligence security activities during a period of unprecedented threats. We need some-one who can actively and effectively engage and educate the private sector on the threats—something Bill has done time and again. Director Evanina was unanimously approved by the Senate Select Com-mittee on Intelligence in May, and it is time this body moved forward. We can-not continue to let politics or non-germane issues get in the way of con-firming good people. I ask this body to confirm Bill Evanina as Director of the National Counterintelligence Security Center without further delay. I yield to my vice chairman of the Intel Committee. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Virginia. Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I want to join with the chairman of the com-mittee and basically echo what he has said. Bill Evanina is a true professional. I have had a chance to work with him for a number of years in my role on the Intelligence Committee and, more re-cently, as vice chair. Let me cite one example. Outside of his lane—not a duty as re-quired—Bill has been a consistent voice in raising concerns about the chal-lenges and threats that are posed by China. As a matter of fact, the chair-man and I were recently in Austin, and Bill came down and gave one of the most powerful briefs I have heard,

which he has done a number of times for the committee and increasingly for the business community, talking in an honest, straightforward way about the security threats, the intellectual prop-erty theft, the host of concerns that confront our country by China. Bill Evanina is one of those rare pub-lic servants, and I don’t think—as the chairman has pointed out, since he re-ceived unanimous confirmation from the Intelligence Committee—that there is any question about his service, any question about his temperament, any question about his ability to do the job—no partisan challenges to him, as the chairman has mentioned. He has served in his current position for 3
1⁄2 years. We do him and other intelligence professionals a disservice when they are arbitrarily held up for confirma-tion, not because of a substantive issue that this individual may have per-formed or not performed but because of a totally extraneous issue. My intent today, along with the chairman, was to ask unanimous con-sent that the Senate proceed to the Ex-ecutive Calendar nomination, getting Bill Evanina permanently confirmed to this job. He is an individual who, if we are not careful and don’t act on soon, may decide to take his extraordinary professional skills and find much high-er remuneration in the private sector rather than serving our country. I am not going to ask for that UC today in deference to one of our col-leagues who has lodged an objection to the nomination. It is my hope that be-fore the end of this session, the chair-man and I will come to the floor one more time and make this request. I implore the Member who has a chal-lenge against Mr. Evanina, again, not based on his performance, not based on his politics, not based on any profes-sionalism he brings to this job—my hope is that the Member will reflect and decide to remove this extraneous objection and allow this great profes-sional to be confirmed to a position he has already served in for the last 3
1⁄2 years. I yield back. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Rhode Island.

TRIBUTE TO DEPARTING SENATORS Mr. REED. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to salute my colleagues who are departing the Senate at the conclusion of the 115th Congress: B
OB C
ORKER of Tennessee, J EFF FLAKE of Arizona, O
RRIN HATCH of Utah, H EIDI H
EITKAMP of North Dakota, D EAN H
ELLER of Nevada, J OEDONNELLY of In-diana, C
LAIRE MCCASKILL of Missouri, B
ILLNELSON of Florida, and J ONKYLof Arizona. All of these Members have dedicated themselves to serving their constituents, their States, and our country. The institution of the Senate and the Nation as a whole are stronger because of their service and commit-ment. I have been privileged to serve with each and every one of them and want to spend a few moments thanking each of them for the wisdom and experience they brought to their work and for their friendship. BOBCORKER and I worked on many foreign policy matters together, given my role as ranking member on the Armed Services Committee and his as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. I have appreciated B
OB’s willingness to reach across the aisle in an attempt to remove barriers to gain-ing bipartisan cooperation on bills and other policy matters. I also appreciate how much B
OBwas willing to speak his mind and stand up to administrations of his party and of my party over the last several years, particularly with re-spect to his very astute analysis of the situation with Russia and other major issues confronting the United States today. He has long focused on international development and human rights, causes I have been glad to support alongside him, including a joint resolution, Sup-porting a Diplomatic Solution in Yemen and Condemning the Murder of Jamal Khashoggi; for promoting eco-nomic growth in developing countries through U.S. business investment in the recently enacted BUILD Act; and consistently fighting to end modern slavery. We also served together on the Bank-ing, Housing, and Urban Affairs Com-mittee. Here, too, he spent his time reaching across the aisle, trying to find constructive solutions, and informing our work on issues ranging from finan-cial system reforms to housing finance. We will miss his bipartisan spirit, and I wish B
OBonly the best as he leaves the Senate. I have also had the privilege and pleasure to join with J
EFF FLAKE in many moments; last week, we were at an event together honoring the late Senator John McCain. He reminisced about the times he worked with John on key policies that aimed to put our country over party politics. He worked hard to resolve tough issues like immigration reform and protecting the special counsel inves-tigation, and his preferred route to ad-dressing these challenges was not to in-crease the heated rhetoric but to turn down the volume of the debate, so all sides could be heard and so the Senate could try to move forward in a rational and bipartisan way. Just as with B
OBCORKER , JEFF’s ap-proach will be missed in this body. I hope others on both sides of the aisle will recognize what they have done and take up their mantle. O
RRIN HATCH has long served the peo-ple of Utah with distinction as chair-man of three committees: Finance, Ju-diciary and what was once called the Labor Committee but is now the HELP Committee. He worked across the aisle to pass landmark laws, often with his friend Senator Ted Kennedy. He was in-strumental in passing critical laws, like expanding access to healthcare for children through the CHIP program and providing help to those suffering with HIV/AIDS through the Ryan White CARE Act. I was pleased to have the opportunity to work with him in 2005, 2010, and 2015 to reauthorize the Stem Cell Thera-peutic and Research Act, to build upon and improve the National Marrow Donor Program and the National Cord Blood Inventory to better treat dis-eases and expand access to lifesaving therapies. Most recently, he helped enact the Music Modernization Act, which I know meant a lot to him, given his own musical interests and talents. He ends his service here as the Sen-ate’s President pro tempore. I wish him health and happiness in his retirement. I think his retirement will be just as active as his days in the U.S. Senate, given his personality and also given his determination to serve wherever he is. HEIDI HEITKAMP , as she put it ‘‘beat the odds’’ to get here. A breast cancer survivor, the lesson she learned from that experience is to use the time she has been given for ‘‘good and noble pur-poses.’’ She ‘‘chose for good or for bad to come to the United States Senate’’ and has served a noble purpose with noble action. We are so grateful that she did. H
EIDI has been a tireless champion of North Dakota throughout her time in the Senate. She worked hard to advance opportunities for Native Americans and veterans, to boost funding for flood protection, and to secure the northern border, to name just a few. She and I worked together on the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee. Most recently, I was par-ticularly appreciative of her insight on proxy access and her support for my legislation on this matter, S. 3614, the Corporate Governance Fairness Act. H
EIDIhas also been a relentless advo-cate for a functioning Export-Import Bank, an issue critical to many North Dakotans. Her voice and insight will be missed on this issue and so many oth-ers that come before the banking com-mittee. In addition, over the last 2 years, H
EIDIhas taken on the issue of mater-nal mortality rates in our country. More women in the United States die from pregnancy-related complications than in most developed nations, and the number is increasing. This has im-pacted so many families in North Da-kota and across the country, and H
EIDI has worked across the aisle to put forth solutions. In the coming days, we expect President Trump to sign into law her legislation, which I was privi-leged to cosponsor, to help address this issue. I salute her and wish her the best. D

unemployment levels in the country. We worked to ensure extensions of emergency unemployment assistance in order to provide relief to Americans who lost their jobs through no fault of their own. Our work together was of great im-portance, and I wish him the best in all of his future endeavors. I want to turn my attention to three Members I had the privilege to work with and serve with on the Armed Services Committee. J
OEDONNELLY has been the ranking member of the Strategic Forces Sub-committee. He chose this position be-cause of the Navy’s installation in In-diana called the Naval Surface Warfare Center—Crane. This installation serves as the primary engineering center for the Navy’s Strategic Systems Pro-gram, which manages our fleet of bal-listic missile weapons systems. I had the chance to join Joe on a visit, and I was most impressed with their capa-bilities but more impressed with his tireless efforts to ensure that this fa-cility—and indeed all of Indiana—had the very best. In addition to ensuring our men and women in uniform have the resources and tools they need—like those manu-factured in Crane—J
OEhas always been concerned about caring for veterans and is a well-known advocate for sui-cide prevention programs. Indeed, it was his legislation, more than any oth-ers, that helped establish a program to assist veterans and to assist Active- Duty personnel who are coping with su-icidal tendencies. That was something J
OEdid with great passion and great commitment and great success. J
OEassumed the seat that Senator Richard Lugar previously held and car-ried on the legacy of Senator Lugar’s Cooperative Threat Reduction Program into the future, which today continues to secure stocks of nuclear, chemical, and biological agents around the world. His work on reducing stockpiles of these dangerous weapons is a critical component of making the world safer for generations to come. J
OEDONNELLY has done great work here, and I wish him well. He is a gen-tleman and someone I admire and re-spect immensely. I have also been extremely proud to serve alongside C
LAIRE MCCASKILL on the Armed Services Committee. Claire has been a leader of the Senate effort to prevent and respond to sexual as-sault in our military. She was a prin-cipal cosponsor of the Victims Protec-tion Act, a bipartisan package of re-forms that represent a substantial leap forward in preventing and responding to sexual assaults in the military. It is a testament to C
LAIRE ’s determination and hard work that these laws are in place, but, also, she was the first to recognize that our work is not done. She was continually involved in ensur-ing that whatever legislative initia-tives we passed were actually imple-mented. That work is ongoing, and C
LAIRE ’s efforts have given us a strong foundation to continue those efforts. In addition to the Victims Protection Act, CLAIRE led the effort to reform management of Arlington National Cemetery to address significant prob-lems with the burials of servicemem-bers and helped to establish a single agency responsible for POW-MIA recov-ery and accounting efforts. C
LAIRE has also worked tirelessly to end wasteful wartime contracting prac-tices, following in the footsteps of an-other Missouri Senator and one of her political heroes, President Harry S. Truman. C
LAIRE has been a steadfast advocate for oversight throughout her career, and her work to root out waste and strengthen accountability has made a difference in how effectively the government works for the Amer-ican people. Again, I wish her well in the future and know it will be a future that is also committed to service to others. B
ILLNELSON has been a close and valued colleague for many years in the Armed Services Committee. He is the only Senator to have flown in space and, as a result, has been our acknowl-edged expert, to both Republicans and Democrats, on matters pertaining to space. His knowledge of military and civilian space issues was particularly important during our debate on replac-ing the Russian RD–180 rocket engine, which is used in a number of national security launches, with a U.S. variant. That debate, along with his leadership on NASA reauthorization legislation, has introduced competition for space launch to a wide array of new compa-nies. As a nation, we are much better off for his efforts. Because of Senator N
ELSON ’s leadership, we now have a vi-brant and entrepreneurial launch and satellite industry that reaches well outside the traditional national secu-rity realm and is lowering the cost of access to space. Recently, he took on the cyber mis-sion as the ranking member on the Cy-bersecurity Subcommittee. His steady hand was integral in guiding this new subcommittee during a time in which we face countless cyber threats. We will miss his knowledge and leadership as we debate pressing issues of our na-tional security in the next Congress and Congresses to come. He has also done able work as the lead Democrat on the Commerce Com-mittee, fighting for consumers. And, as a strong advocate for stricter gun con-trol legislation, we worked together on the 3D Printed Gun Safety Act of 2018 and on the Extreme Risk Protection Order and Violence Prevention Act. I also want to thank him for his lead-ership in enacting the Military Lend-ing Act in 2006, which caps the annual interest rate for an extension of con-sumer credit to a servicemember or his or her dependents at 36 percent. Be-cause of his efforts, servicemembers and their families have strong con-sumer protections that defend them against unscrupulous lenders who unpatriotically prey upon them while they are selflessly and courageously defending our Nation. He has done a re-markable job because this legislation truly does protect our protectors— those men and women who serve over-seas—so they are not taken advantage of here, back at home. I enjoyed our time serving together and wish him the best as he goes for-ward. He is a great American. Finally, I would like to recognize Senator JONKYL. I thank J ONfor his willingness to serve again following the passing of Senator John McCain. I had the privilege of serving with him in his prior stint in this body. He served for many years in Republican leadership, including as minority whip. He was also a longstanding member of the Finance Committee. I was not on this committee, but given my advocacy for extending unemployment insur-ance—for which there was a critical need at the time—I did have a chance to serve with him on the Conference Committee for the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012. It was a pleasure to serve with him. He is a man of principle, a man of great decency and dignity, someone who has honored the Senate with his service, honored Arizona with his service, and makes us all very proud to know him. It was indeed a pleasure to serve, all too briefly, with him as a member of the Armed Services Committee. I would like to thank him for his service and wish him well as he leaves this body once more. To all my col-leagues, I give them my greatest re-spect and admiration for their service to their States, to the Senate, and to the United States of America. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Mississippi. Mr. WICKER. My friend from Ne-braska, Senator S

The lessons these three Nebraska students can teach us are enduringly relevant not only for other high schoolers but in this body today. I would like to read briefly from each of their essays. Ingrid Williamsen wrote:

Thus, the Constitution is in-deed a structural embodiment of those famous Truths which we held then and hold now to be self-evident.’’ I am grateful to have received so many great essays from students across Nebraska. I thank all of them for their work. It is clear to me that not only their classmates but Wash-ington and this body can learn some Schoolhouse Rock Civics from Ne-braska high school kids.

THERELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE DECLARA -
TION OF INDEPENDENCE AND THE CONSTITU -
TION 
INGRID WILLIAMSON —LOGAN VIEW SENIOR HIGH  The Declaration of Independence and The Constitution are very separate but closely related documents. They are quite similar in many ways and work together to form the backbone of the United States. The Declaration of Independence was writ-ten to justify the Colonies independence from Great Britain. It goes further and sets forth the principals and ideas for a fair new government. The Constitution outlines how the new government would function and en-force the rights in the Declaration. The Declaration of Independence was de-signed and drafted to justify the Colonies breaking away from Great Brittan. The Dec-laration made clear promises as to the lib-erties that should be given to all men, that all men are created equal, and that everyone has the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. The Declaration set limits on the government to ensure these rights are inevitable and never taken away by the gov-ernment. The Constitution was put in place so that the rights and liberties laid out in the Dec-laration of Independence could be enforced. It is the document that sets forth how the new government will function. It puts limits on the government so that it cannot infringe upon the rights of the people. It gives the new government the power to guarantee the liberty of all the people. Both functions are directly tied to the Declaration. The Declaration of Independence will re-main the same as it is now, it cannot be changed. This makes it a purely historical document. The Constitution is a living docu-ment and has been and can be amended. This was by design and allows both documents to better protect the natural rights of all. The relationship between the two docu-ments, the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, is one that cannot be bro-ken. Without either of them, the history and future of the United States would have a much different blueprint. They are two of the most important and endearing docu-ments in the history of the United States. Chief Justice Warren Burger once said, ‘‘The Declaration of Independence was the prom-ise, The Constitution was the fulfillment’’. The Declaration of Independence would be an unfulfilled promise had the Constitution not been put in place. KATE PIPHER —NEBRASKA CHRISTIAN  The Declaration of Independence and The Constitution of the United States of America share a substantial relationship because they both outline basic truths for The American People that have caused our country to thrive. To begin, the Founding Fathers argue that all rights come from a Creator, not a fallible government. Then they conclude that the purpose of the American govern-ment is to secure these God-given rights. The Declaration of Independence recog-nizes there are Laws of Nature that God es-tablished. These laws are principles for what is just, right, and true. They state that all people have equal standing and dignity be-fore God. Because certain truths are self-evi-dent, citizens carry responsibility to self- govern. They are accountable to more than a man-made government, they are accountable to a Sovereign God. The authors of both documents recognized they were discovering, not defining the in-alienable rights of humanity. The right to Life, Liberty, and Happiness outlined first in the Declaration of Independence and then again in the 5th amendment to the Constitu-tion are God-given. The Founding Fathers adopted a humble posture to both their Cre-ator and a greater humanity. They under-stood they did not possess the power to rede-fine the rights of man. Their role was to de-fend, discover, and reveal those rights for the citizens. The Constitution’s goal is to pro-tect the inalienable rights of every indi-vidual Image-Bearer that the Declaration of Independence lays out. This is the unique, profound outlook that both documents por-tray. It was no accident that the men who penned the Constitution utilized many of the terms from the Declaration of Independence. The Constitution is an attempt to mirror natural law with a civil, written law. In an ideal world, the natural law of God and the law of man would align exactly. The Found-ing Fathers stressed that the bent of the human heart is towards tyranny. The Dec-laration of Independence was an announce-ment that the citizens of America would not live under tyranny any longer and desired an alternative form of government. The Con-stitution resulted as a document that pro-tected the young country from inevitable tyranny. The authors of the Constitution perceived that in order to preserve the truths laid out in the Declaration and to secure the bless-ings of liberty for their children and fol-lowing generations, a written law was nec-essary. The Declaration of Independence pro-vided a mandate for government to preserve, secure, and provide the rights our generous God bestowed upon us. The Constitution ful-filled that mandate. The ‘‘We the People’’ from the preamble are, in essence, the same citizens who recognized their rights from their Creator in the Declaration of Independ-ence. Acting upon the desire to preserve these rights, they crafted two humble docu-ments that cataclysmicly shaped the course of America’s history. PATRICK COLLINS FROM MR . JOHN ROSHONE ’S 
APUSH CLASS AT MOUNT MICHAEL BENE -
DICTINE IN ELKHORN , NEBRASKA  One of the most fitting metaphors attrib-uted to Abraham Lincoln is that of the Con-stitution as the silver frame that protects the golden apple of the Declaration of Inde-pendence. While it certainly is apt to say that the Constitution’s framework is meant to embody the political philosophy presented in the Declaration of Independence, even more important than this overarching idea is a more specific one. Most Americans are fa-miliar with the words ‘‘we hold these truths to be self-evident,’’ but arguably more perti-nent to the relationship between the Con-stitution and the Declaration is an idea only discovered through a more than cursory ex-amination of the Declaration’s less cele-brated portion: the 27 grievances listed against the king of England. These griev-ances illustrate the ease with which the British government simply disregarded the English ‘‘constitution,’’ wherein the rights of the people and powers of the government were often vague, unwritten traditional un-derstandings subject to individual interpre-tation. The first Americans knew from expe-rience that any document or governmental structure attempting to restrict the govern-ment and preserve the people’s rights would be woefully inadequate if not written frankly and followed strictly. In that sense, the Dec-laration is not simply about the need for independence but even more about the ancillarity of a written Constitution in pre-serving the desired freedom. Understanding the importance of adhering to a strict structure, it is eminently clear that any interpretation or judicial decision that seeks to change the original meaning of this structure is misguided. Attempting to push the Constitution in a desired direction without actually changing its words, while typically well-intentioned, betrays the ideals expressed in the Declaration and fought for in the Revolution and undermines the pur-pose of creating a written Constitution in the first place, and yet so many still seek to do so. Our cultural misunderstanding of this portion of the reasoning behind American independence is so pervasive that a large portion of American society truly believes that the Supreme Court has the authority to create new laws and amendments from the bench. If so many Americans continue to treat our founding documents with such flippancy, we will not even realize as our leaders begin to do the same and our Con-stitution effectively morphs into the vaguely understood one that the British had so long ago. We have forgotten so thoroughly the grievances that necessitated independence that we would not bat an eye if our own gov-ernment were to violate the same principles

of freedom today. Our Founding Fathers would cringe to see our Constitution treated more and more like the one from which they sought so furiously to gain independence at the genesis of our nation. Thus, the Con-stitution is indeed a structural embodiment of those famous truths which we held then and hold now to be self-evident. However, the oft-forgotten grievances in the Declaration render the need for a government and a peo-ple that hold to the original meaning of that Constitution equally self-evident to any who dare to dig deeper.

GUATEMALA Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, yester-day the Government of Guatemala took a decisive step toward regaining sovereignty. Guatemala revoked the visas of and deported 11 U.N. personnel working for the International Commis-sion Against Impunity in Guatemala, better known by its Spanish acronym CICIG. Chartered in 2006 to help the Guate-malan state fight corruption, CICIG morphed into a modern-day United Na-tions proconsul, selectively admin-istering justice and abusing power in ways never intended. Voices on the political left, both here and overseas, will no doubt decry the decision by the duly constituted Gov-ernment of Guatemala. I take the floor of the Senate this afternoon to state plainly my emphatic approval of this action by our Guatemalan friends. Prior to yesterday’s action, Guate-malan President Jimmy Morales had previously announced that CICIG’s mandate would not be renewed after September 3 of next year. The Presi-dent’s decision marks a logical and welcome step toward ending CICIG’s presence in Guatemala. Ultimately, an independent country has the right to decide if, and under what terms, a su-pranational institution can administer justice within its borders. CICIG was never meant to be permanent, and no country could accept an unending in-fringement on its sovereignty. Cer-tainly, we in the United States would never consent to having an inter-national body—accountable to no one— run our judicial system. Our Guate-malan friends have determined it is time for CICIG to leave, and they have a right as a sovereign nation to make that decision. The initial reasons behind CICIG’s presence in Guatemala cannot be dis-puted. Like many Latin American countries, Guatemala had suffered from pervasive corruption, and its gov-ernment was in ruins from a decades- long civil war. Criminal enterprises colluded with politicians, military offi-cers, and other government officials to bribe, cheat, and steal. Mafias, with deep tentacles into the state, acted with such impunity that Guatemala felt compelled to ask for outside help. In 2006, Guatemala and the United Na-tions signed an agreement meant to ‘‘support, strengthen, and assist’’ Gua-temalan institutions responsible for in-vestigating crimes committed by so- called ‘‘illegal security groups’’ and ‘‘clandestine security organizations.’’ Although CICIG enjoys complete func-tional independence, the agreement stated that CICIG must discharge its mandate in ‘‘accordance with Guate-malan law and the provisions of the Constitution.’’ Regrettably, this provi-sion has not been followed. Despite noble goals, it has become apparent that CICIG is not being held accountable to either Guatemalan law or the United Nations. As the largest financial contributor to the United Na-tions, the United States has an interest in investigating the credible allega-tions that CICIG was grossly overstep-ping its mandate. After all, the Amer-ican taxpayers were largely financing this enterprise. The questionable practices of CICIG and its unelected leader have been re-ported in our national papers. The Wall Street Journal’s Mary Anastasia O’Grady has been a close observer of Colombian jurist Ivan Velasquez, who serves as CICIG’s Commissioner. Ms. O’Grady states: 
Under his leadership, there is strong evi-dence that CICIG routinely flouts the rule of law and tramples civil liberties in violation of the Guatemalan constitution. His methods can’t be supported by a republic that pledges allegiance to transparency and human rights. 
Powerful institutions have a tend-ency to amass more powers to them-selves and stretch their authority far beyond their legal mandates. Even its most strident supporters have ac-knowledged that CICIG now essentially answers to no one and needs to be re-formed. Nowhere is this contention better supported than the CICIG- backed persecution of the Bitkov fam-ily on behalf of the Russian Govern-ment. For all its flaws, which are nu-merous, CICIG’s decision to conspire with Russia is the most outrageous. Igor and Irina Bitkov built a success-ful paper mill company, the Northwest Timber Company, in Russia’s Kaliningrad enclave. This rare example of successful private enterprise in Rus-sia was once valued at nearly half a bil-lion dollars, but success comes with a price in Putin’s Russia. In 2005, a senior officer of the state- owned Sberbank demanded that the Bitkovs sell him a controlling stake in their company. Imagine. It is an offer the Bitkovs refused. Two years later, the Bitkovs’ 16-year-old daughter, Anastasia, was kidnapped, drugged, raped, and held until the Bitkov family paid a ransom. In April 2008, three Russian state banks—the VTB, Sberbank, and Gazprombank—forced the Bitkovs’ company into bankruptcy by calling in the immediate repayment of nearly $160 million in loans. Traumatized and threatened with detention and death, the Bitkovs decided to flee Russia. More death threats followed as Moscow opened a criminal case in 2009. The Bitkovs eventually immigrated to Guatemala in 2009 after paying a le-gitimate law firm for Guatemalan passports with new identities for their protection. The Bitkovs settled into a new life that was blessedly free from Russian harassment and intimidation. Igor and Irina began teaching at a local school. Anastasia began to heal from her ordeal. A son, Vladimir, was born in 2012. The reprieve was short-lived. VTB, one of the Russian banks, collaborated in 2015 with CICIG and the Guatemalan Attorney General to arrest the Bitkovs for passport violations. Detained in ap-palling conditions, Anastasia was de-nied medication and had a nervous breakdown. Three-year-old Vladimir was sent to an orphanage for 42 days without having contact with his par-ents or appointed guardians. Eventu-ally freed by a court order and with an upper respiratory infection, conjunc-tivitis in both eyes, and clear physical and psychological abuse, Vladimir re-turned to his family. This is modern- day CICIG in Guatemala. Under the direction of CICIG, the Bitkovs were sent to trial in February of 2017. The Guatemalan Court of Ap-peals, however, enjoined the Bitkovs’ prosecution and stated that the family was not criminally liable for passport violations. Despite this injunction, a lower court, at the behest of CICIG, went ahead with the case and eventu-ally sentenced Igor Bitkov to 19 years and Irina and Anastasia to 14 years in prison. Let me repeat—19 years and 14 years for passport violations. They were passports that they believed to be legitimate based on legal advice they had been given. These were infractions that are usually settled with a fine at worst, but this was all in collaboration with CICIG and the Russian accusers. Following more convoluted legal wrangling, Igor Bitkov was released on house arrest in May, but, inexplicably, Irina and Anastasia remained in jail— more injunctions, more appeals, more tortuous legal proceedings. Irina and Anastasia were finally released on bail in mid-June. This is CICIG in Guate-mala. Pushed by CICIG, the Constitu-tional Court, which is the highest court in Guatemala, ordered a retrial for the Bitkovs. It began last week and supposedly continues. American taxpayers who are footing the bill for CICIG have a right to ask Commissioner Velasquez and his CICIG team: Is this the way to fight corrup-tion in Guatemala? In short, CICIG, under the direction of Commissioner Velasquez, has gone from fighting cor-ruption to doing Vladimir Putin’s dirty work even. He has gone even so far as to persecute victims, like the Bitkovs, of corruption. The Bitkov affair demonstrates how badly CICIG has gone astray and why President Morales is right to want it out of his country. CICIG was estab-lished to help investigate and pros-ecute Mafias who were entrenched in the state and able to act with impu-nity. Yet it gets involved in a passport

violation case against a family that is clearly fleeing Russian persecution. CICIG is supposed to be above re-proach. Yet it collaborates with a state-owned Russian bank that, inci-dentally, is currently under U.S. sanc-tions. The CICIG is doing the bidding of Putin’s henchmen in its acting as the long arm of Russia’s dictatorship. The intervention of a Kremlin-controlled bank shows that influencing CICIG is a part of the Kremlin’s broader campaign to exert pressure across Latin America, and we ought to be concerned about that. Earlier this month, in the Wall Street Journal, Ms. O’Grady wrote that the creeping intervention from Moscow is designed to damage U.S. interests by destabilizing liberal democracy. ADM Craig Faller, the commander of the U.S. Southern Command, told the Senate Armed Services Committee that Russia is flooding Latin America’s internet, social media, and television outlets with original and reproduced propaganda to sow doubt about U.S. in-tentions. Russia has also provided cru-cial financial support to the infamous Maduro regime in Venezuela, and it competes with the United States to provide military support for regional partners. Another strategic competitor, China, is also seeking to influence important U.S. partners in Latin America. China has provided more than $140 billion in Belt and Road Initiative loan commit-ments. Beijing is now Latin America’s second largest trading partner. Although CICIG once played a sig-nificant role in exposing and pros-ecuting serious corruption, it has now fallen victim to Lord Acton’s famous observation—that power tends to cor-rupt and absolute power corrupts abso-lutely. President Morales has made a deci-sion, as the duly elected head of a sov-ereign country, that he will no longer tolerate an increasingly neocolonial force. The United States should stand behind this decision. The CICIG was never supposed to stay indefinitely. This move by the Guatemalan Gov-ernment does not absolve its own re-sponsibility to fight corruption. In-deed, we should demand a redoubling of these efforts. As a critical country in the Western Hemisphere, a return to pre-CICIG conditions would be unac-ceptable. This is the chance for Guate-malans to work toward the justice that CICIG abandoned with its complicity in Moscow’s vendetta. This should begin with an end to the Bitkov family’s long nightmare. Their ordeal has gone way beyond a miscarriage of justice, and with CICIG’s being gone, Guatemala must do the right thing without fur-ther delay or excuse. In conclusion, the duly constituted Government of Guatemala has made the right decision and should be con-gratulated for yesterday’s action. The country’s leadership took a necessary step in asserting its sovereignty and in ending a dysfunctional relationship with CICIG, a well-intended agency that has exceeded its mandate and out-lived whatever usefulness it may ini-tially have had.

RECOGNIZING OUR MEN AND WOMEN IN LAW ENFORCEMENT Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, I come to the floor to honor our men and women in law enforcement. As Mem-bers of Congress and their staffs head home this holiday season, we must re-member the sacrifice of those who make our communities safe, those who make our safety possible. This year, across the United States, 143 law enforcement officers have paid the ultimate price. In Colorado, we honor three fallen of-ficers. We honor Deputy Sheriff Heath McDonald Gumm, whose final act was to bravely pursue an armed suspect. We will never forget the courage and brav-ery of his action. We honor Deputy Sheriff Micah Lee Flick, who was killed in the line of duty in February of this year after serving in the El Paso County Sheriff’s Office for 11 years. We also honor the memory of Sergeant Matthew Moreno, who was killed in the line of duty in Las Animas County just last week. He was responding to re-ports of domestic violence when his cruiser and that of another officer’s crashed into a civilian’s vehicle that was headed in the opposite direction. Unfortunately, the occupants of the other vehicle, including a 1-year-old child, also lost their lives. The pain of losing loved ones this close to the holidays is unimaginable. Sergeant Moreno ends his watch after having served honorably for 5 years. He is survived by his loving fam-ily, including his three beautiful chil-dren, Summer, Morgan, and Jared. He has been described as being a superhero to his kids. It seems very fitting given the bravery that he showed throughout his career. He is also remembered for his sense of humor and his love for hunting and fishing—something all Coloradans can relate to. Our prayers are certainly with Sergeant Moreno’s family and with the families of those in the other vehicle. I also offer my sin-cere condolences to the entire Las Animas County Sheriff’s Department. The officers have not just lost a fellow officer but a brother. All of the officers whom we lost this year were neighbors, beloved family members, and extraordinary Colo-radans who gave their lives to protect their communities. Although the need is great, so few of us are blessed with the level of bravery and courage shown each and every day by the men and women in law enforcement. As we all enjoy the warmth of this holiday season, law enforcement offi-cers around the country will stand guard in cold and uncertain streets. This includes the selfless men and women who serve right here in the U.S. Capitol, who work through the holi-days to ensure that every American who visits the Nation’s Capitol can do so safely. It is important that we keep them in our thoughts as we gather with family and friends this holiday season to celebrate. I would also like to take a moment to thank the families of these brave men and women whose sacrifices must not be forgotten. They endure time apart from their loved ones so that families, like millions across this coun-try, will know peace and security dur-ing their holiday celebrations. When thinking about the brave men and women who defend that thin blue line, I am always reminded of the words of LTC Dave Grossman, who said, ‘‘American law enforcement is the loyal and brave sheepdog—always standing watch for the wolf that lurks in the dark.’’ It is my hope that the thoughts and prayers we all offer to those who wear the blue uniform will bring them comfort as they carry out this solemn duty. I am thankful for their service and thankful to their fam-ilies for their continued sacrifice. I am also reminded of the words of Joe Rice, a former State legislator in Colorado, with whom I served. He served multiple tours in Iraq and Af-ghanistan and wrote how he prays for his fellow soldiers and their safety each and every day by saying and praying: 
For all of those around the world in harm’s way, we pray with you. Please God, just not today. 
Each and every day, we echo that same prayer. Thank you to the men and women in blue. I also thank my colleague from New Jersey, Senator M
ENENDEZ , for allow-ing me to speak out of turn. I greatly appreciate it. I thank the Presiding Officer for tak-ing the Chair. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. G
ARDNER ). The Senator from New Jer-sey.

HITEHOUSE for his passion, his persistence, and his refusal to let the Senate be silent in the face of one of the greatest threats to ever confront our Nation and the world.

carbon pollution responsible for warm-ing our planet is another year in which the Federal Government of the United States fails to protect future genera-tions from the immense environ-mental, economic, and human costs in-flicted by climate change. I yearn for the day that this body summons the courage to stand up to the special interests and boldly con-front this challenge, for the longer we wait, the more expensive and the less effective we will be. And if you don’t believe me, just look at our National Flood Insurance Program, which is al-ready in dire need of comprehensive, forward-thinking reform. I have spent the better part of the past 2 years bringing Democrats and Republicans together in support of such a plan. Yet the majority has stub-bornly refused to debate our legisla-tion, forcing us to pass short-term re-authorizations that preserve a broken status quo. Like the totality of the cli-mate threat, when it comes to flood in-surance, every time we kick the can down the road, the can only gets heav-ier. For our coastal and inlet commu-nities, climate change isn’t some far- out problem; it is here. We are already feeling the effects and bearing the costs in the form of rising sea levels and increasingly powerful storms. Even if the President of the United States suddenly reversed course and put America on a path to slow our chang-ing climate, we would still need to ad-dress how we manage a heightened risk for flooding. From fishing, to tourism, to trade and so much more, the fact is, America’s coastal communities are vital to our long-term economic com-petitiveness, and to give up on them in the face of rising sea levels would be to give up on our country. According to the Union of Concerned Scientists, sea level rise will put an es-timated 325,000 homes and businesses, worth more than $135 billion, at risk of chronic flooding in the next 30 years. With increased risks for flooding comes a whole host of challenges. Falling property values will further strain local budgets, leading to downgraded government credit ratings. As commu-nities lose out on approximately $1.5 billion in property taxes per year, hard-working taxpayers will feel the pain. It will cut away at middle-class families’ most valuable asset, the foun-dation of their financial nest egg, which is their home. According to a paper published by the University of Pennsylvania Librar-ies, ‘‘As sea level rise manifests along the coasts—reducing property value— impacts on revenue will present new challenges in servicing debt . . . and present a greater probability of default by local government.’’ We cannot simply keep spending money to preserve the status quo. We need a system for managing flood risk that pushes our country toward resil-iency and treats our people and the communities they live in fairly. But, unfortunately, we have remained at an impasse for over a year now, unable to fix a program that we all know is badly broken. We in New Jersey witnessed firsthand the pervasive problems plaguing the National Flood Insurance Program—or what we call NFIP—after Superstorm Sandy hit in 2012. It was bad enough that so many New Jerseyans had to grapple with the heartbreaking loss of their homes in the wrath of Sandy, so it made my blood boil to see the suf-fering compounded by a badly broken flood insurance program. We found our-selves lost in a system that put the policyholder last and that looked for every reason to deny legitimate claims and made up some when they didn’t exist. We had homeowners who found the foundations of their homes had washed away into the ocean, only to have their claim denied because their insurance company claimed it wasn’t floodwaters but moving soil that caused the damage. The insurance ad-juster didn’t stop to consider that maybe it was the 5-foot storm surge that moved the soil in the first place. This is a photograph of Doug Quinn, who served honorably in the U.S. Ma-rines. He is a constituent whom I have gotten to know very well and who got snagged by this very loophole. As you can see from this picture, the storm surge from Sandy inundated his home, and it ripped apart his foundation, leaving a large hole in his living room. But despite paying his flood insurance premiums for years and despite serving our Nation honorably as a U.S. marine, Doug’s claim was denied. Supposedly it was Earth movement, but the Earth never moved until the 5-foot storm surge came along. We saw mitigation programs that were so cumbersome and delayed that many homeowners simply gave up. We had new flood maps come online that were 80 percent inaccurate in some counties. We had FEMA using taxpayer dollars to drag homeowners through expensive litigation until they gave up on their flood claims. The struggles of everyday New Jerseyans revealed to me the dramatic shortcomings in our Flood Insurance Program and left me determined to fix them, so I began working on flood in-surance reform that took the lessons we learned after Sandy and turned them into action. In the summer of 2017, I introduced the Sustainable, Affordable, Fair, and Efficient—or SAFE—NFIP Act, which is a comprehensive flood insurance re-form bill cosponsored by four Demo-crats and three Republicans here in the Senate. I know this town already has too many acronyms, but this one clear-ly spells out the first major goals we have in this bill. We want the NFIP— the National Flood Insurance Pro-gram—to be sustainable, we want it to be affordable, we want it to be fair, we and want it to be efficient. Let’s start with sustainability. We have to put the NFIP on the path to solvency. Since Katrina in 2005, the NFIP has been in the red, borrowing from the Treasury Department to pay claims. Some say that we should just jack up the premiums on homeowners and keep charging more to get at this imbal-ance; that if we ask homeowners to pay more and more and more, eventually the NFIP will have enough money to pay all of the claims without bor-rowing. But higher premiums alone are not the answer. Of course we want ev-erybody to pay their fair share, but the undeniable reality is that the more we raise the premiums, the more home-owners leave the National Flood Insur-ance Program altogether, and that guarantees the program’s failure. Instead of looking simply to raise prices, I want to focus on reducing costs. I believe the best way out of this hole is to make proactive investments in resiliency and mitigation to reduce the damage in the first place. In other words, we must build coastal commu-nities that are resilient and strong, so the damage inflicted by the storms of the future is less expensive to recover. That is why the SAFE NFIP Act in-cludes $1 billion-per-year in mitigation funding and more than triples the max-imum increased cost of compliance—or the ICC—grant from $30,000 to $100,000. We also require that this funding be spent more wisely, allowing home-owners to use ICC grants before their house is destroyed. I have never under-stood why we require homeowners to sit in harm’s way and wait for the next storm to come before we help them re-duce their flood risk. It makes no sense. Our bill would fix that. By giv-ing Americans the tools to reduce their risks, we can save the NFIP and the taxpayer billions of dollars. Our legislation also goes after waste-ful private insurance company fees, which consume about 30 cents of every premium dollar, despite taking on none of the risk. That is good business if you can get it. Don’t get me wrong—that is good business if you can get it, and I have no problem with private compa-nies making a profit, but every dollar they make comes from the pockets of policyholders. The NFIP also currently pays about $400 million in interest every year. That is 10 percent of its annual pre-miums—money that could be going to-ward flood prevention and mitigation. That is why our bill freezes interest payments on the NFIP debt and redi-rects that funding toward mitigation. Rather than paying interest to our-selves and forcing the NFIP to borrow even more, let’s use that money to re-duce future damages, save taxpayer dollars, and build safe communities. We cannot have a solvent and sus-tainable flood insurance program if it isn’t affordable to the people who de-pend on it. The NFIP’s debt and major hurricanes have put upward pressure on premiums, making it more and more expensive to get coverage. So it is no surprise that a lot of people have been forced to drop their flood insur-ance.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES7860 December 19, 2018 
Indeed, in the face of rising pre-miums, the NFIP has lost more than 650,000 policies—or over 10 percent of its total business—just since 2009. Has the risk of flooding decreased since 2009? Absolutely not. Are there fewer homes in floodplains now? No, of course not. By way of example, when you consider the floods that struck Louisiana and Texas and New Jersey in recent years, the answer is an un-equivocal no. What is happening is that the premiums have just gotten too ex-pensive for middle-class families to af-ford. At the end of the day, this also hurts the solvency of the NFIP be-cause, just like every other insurance model, a small pool means a more risky, more expensive pool. Our bill creates a first-of-its-kind, means-tested affordability program that helps middle-class and working families afford flood insurance. Pricing families out of coverage and leaving them without a way to protect their homes does nothing to address the un-derlying risk. On the contrary, it will be taxpayers who ultimately assume the risk when they are asked to fund uninsured disaster assistance. It is our responsibility to taxpayers to make the NFIP as fair and as effi-cient as possible. I have no doubt that hundreds, if not thousands, of New Jerseyans dropped their flood insur-ance after Sandy because of how they were treated. They faithfully paid their premiums for years, often decades, without filing a single claim. Then, when Sandy struck and they tried to collect what they were entitled to, they had to suffer another disaster. This time it was a manmade one—the storm after the storm. After losing ev-erything they had worked for their en-tire lives, they had to fight against an insurance company and a daunting Federal bureaucracy. Some appealed, some sued, and some just gave up. I pledged to them I would never let this happen again. Our legislation makes good on that promise by putting the customer—in this case, the policy-holder—first. We close notorious loopholes that allow insurers to deny claims, such as the infamous earth-movement exclu-sion when we know floodwaters caused the damage. We fix the appeals process, enforcing FEMA’s own deadline to respond to homeowners and giving people who just went through a disaster more time to file their appeal. We require engineer studies to be conducted by—imagine this—actual, li-censed engineers in the State where they are operating. We require insurance companies to provide policyholders with all of the documents used to process their claims so that homeowners aren’t left in the dark. We end the practice of private insur-ance companies spending hundreds of millions of policyholder premium dol-lars on private attorneys whose main goal is to bill as many hours as pos-sible to ultimately deny the policy-holder any resource. Taken together, these reforms will not only give policyholders a fair shake, they will also save the NFIP re-sources that can be better directed to mitigation, to mapping, and to other cost-saving investments. We have to recognize that the NFIP and its 5 million policyholders can’t solve all of our Nation’s flooding prob-lems on their own. We need to invest tens of billions of dollars elevating and buying out flood-prone properties that get hit year after year, those particu-larly repetitively lost properties. We need to incentivize homeowners who ultimately will get out of those flood- prone properties so that they are not subject to the consequences of con-stantly getting flooded and we collec-tively are not subject to the incredible costs that are a result of that. There simply aren’t enough resources in the NFIP to even put a dent in this problem. So instead of spending hun-dreds of billions of dollars on disaster grants each time a storm strikes, why not spend a fraction of that on the front end that will yield real dividends in the future? When a disaster strikes, our immediate priority should always be to save lives and get survivors back to a sense of normalcy as quickly as possible. While recovery funding is absolutely vital, it shouldn’t be at the expense of rebuilding stronger, more resilient communities more capable of weath-ering the next storm. We have a problem in Congress of short-termism: living in the present and not looking ahead. We are afraid of making tough political decisions in the present, even when the future is on the line. We see it with flood insurance, and we see it with climate change. The American people desperately need Congress to overcome this short-sighted short-termism. We must start thinking beyond the storm that just hit or even the one that is on the hori-zon. We must begin thinking about the risk over the next several decades be-cause flood risk is a climate risk we cannot afford to ignore. We must think about what kind of future, what kind of environment, what kind of economy we want to leave to our children and our grandchildren. It should not matter who controls the House, who controls the Senate, or who sits in the White House. The Americans of tomorrow are depending on us, the leaders of today, to be bold, unafraid, and willing to think big. That is why I hope Republicans and Demo-crats alike will continue to work with me on the issue of flood insurance and flood prevention when we return in 2019. I thank, as I said at the beginning of my comments, my distinguished col-league from Rhode Island who has real-ly been the conscience of the Senate on this issue of climate change that af-fects not only those of us now here but future generations of Americans. I have taken one slice of that in talking about the National Flood Insurance Program and how we can mitigate our way and look to a set of circumstances in which we can save enormous con-sequences for New Jersey families and families across our country and save the taxpayers’ money. But the ulti-mate savings in this is beyond a new flood insurance program. It is making sure that we don’t continue to see the climate change that has taken place, which creates the storms that my State endured—Superstorm Sandy— and other major superstorms across the Nation that put us at risk as a peo-ple, that put our economies at risk, that really threaten the very essence of our existence as we know it. I appreciate the distinguished Sen-ator from Rhode Island leading us in this regard. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Rhode Island. Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am very grateful to the distinguished senior Senator from New Jersey for joining me again this week to bring at-tention to the challenges that climate change and rising seas pose for our coastal communities. Our States—New Jersey and Rhode Island—shared the unforgettable experience of Superstorm Sandy, which roared ashore on higher tides and warmer oceans. We know, in New Jersey and Rhode Island, how vulnerable we are. As sea levels rise and storms inten-sify, the National Flood Insurance Pro-gram should be one of our govern-ment’s best tools to educate and pre-pare our communities for the changes that carbon pollution is driving to our coasts. But the program falls well short of this basic goal. Instead of tackling its shortfalls head-on, ahead of the next big storm, for instance, we are getting set to punt again on the Flood Insurance Program. My Ocean State, much smaller than New Jersey, has 400 miles of coastline threatened by sea level rise and storm surge flooding, so telling homeowners and coastal businesses that we will get to it eventually is not good enough. Our coastal risk is growing, not shrink-ing. A 2017 Zillow chart shows that over 4,800 homes in Rhode Island—4,800 fam-ilies’ homes—valued at nearly $3 bil-lion would be under water by 2100, using an optimistic assessment of only 6 feet of sea level rise. Rhode Island’s Coastal Resources Management Coun-cil is now planning for our State to see up to 9 to 12 feet of sea level rise by then. New Jersey, of course, has even more at risk with its bigger shoreline, with over $93 billion worth of property predicted to fall to rising seas. This problem does not wait until the year 2100. It hits earlier. It hits as soon as 30-year mortgages and insurance get hard to come by because banks and in-surers foresee these risks, and that in-hibits buyers, so prices fall—perhaps prices even crash, as Freddie Mac is predicting.

Last year, GAO reported that coastal areas face particularly high financial risks and that annual coastal property losses from sea level rise and increased storms will run into the billions of dol-lars every year in the short run and over $50 billion every year by late cen-tury. GAO pointed to an EPA estimate of $5 trillion in economic costs to coastal property from climate change through 2100. Our coastal States can’t laugh that off because it makes the oil industry uncomfortable to talk about climate change. Investors, creditors, appraisers—ev-erybody who works coastal markets—is taking notice. Last December, the credit rating agency, Moody’s, adopted indicators ‘‘to assess the exposure and overall susceptibility of U.S. states to the physical effects of climate change.’’ This is Moody’s. Moody’s looks particularly at coasts and at the share of a State’s economic activity generated by its coastal communities. It counts the homes built on flood plains, and it counts the risk of ex-treme weather damage as a share of the local economy. The managing director at Moody’s told the Chicago Tribune that Moody’s would be taking these risks into con-sideration when evaluating the credit ratings of coastal municipalities and States. Property appraisers are also starting to incorporate these risks into their work. The Appraisal Institute’s Valu-ation magazine quoted Rhode Island appraiser Brad Hevenor’s warning that homes that receive a 30-year mortgage today ‘‘might be completely different types of property [by the end of their mortgage] than they are today.’’ He points out, as Senator M
ENENDEZ  pointed out, that FEMA flood maps are defective, backward-looking, and often insufficient at accurately predicting risk for communities and homeowners. My frustrations with FEMA’s flood risk maps are no secret. They are noto-riously inaccurate, incomplete, and outdated. The Agency’s modeling is often based on inaccurate data and on methodology from the 1970s. It has proven particularly incapable of accu-rately capturing the different wave and dune dynamics that determine real flood risk along coasts during major storms. The Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council, a small State agency, has had to develop its own models to provide better risk informa-tion to coastal residents and commu-nities than FEMA provides. The con-trast between the State’s work and FEMA’s maps highlights just how cost-ly and potentially life-threatening reli-ance on FEMA’s maps can be. This map is FEMA’s map relative to mean sea level for a 100-year storm hit-ting Charlestown, RI. Here is the code as to how much flooding to expect. The worst flooding for the homes that sur-round Ninigret Pond, along Rhode Is-land’s southern coast, looks to be around 14 feet around this area here. This map shows the CRMC’s pre-diction for the same area for the same storm. It projects that homes in this same area may see closer to 20 feet of floodwaters, which means FEMA’s map is underestimating flood risk by 6 feet. It is not just errors in Rhode Island. Rice University and Texas A&M found that FEMA flood risk maps captured only about 25 percent of the actual damage from storms that hit Houston between 1999 and 2009—25 percent. Ac-cording to the Houston Chronicle, more than half of homes damaged by Hurri-cane Harvey were not listed in any flood risk areas, meaning they were not required to have flood insurance or meet any flood risk mitigation build-ing codes. Congress continues to fund these maps on the cheap, leaving Americans to bear the risk of antiquated models that don’t reflect the changes that cli-mate change is bringing to our coasts. Families are forced to endure the re-peated damage and destruction of their homes, and taxpayers are made to pay the cost of over and over and over re-building the same building in the same place that is already washed away. After Hurricane Harvey in 2017, the Flood Insurance Program hit its $30 billion borrowing limit. We maxed out. So in October of 2017, Congress had to forgive $16 billion worth of debt to free up money to pay off claims for Harvey, Irma, and Maria. The program is cur-rently at least $20 billion in debt, and claims from the 2018 hurricane season are still being processed. The Congres-sional Research Service, as of Sep-tember 2018, found that the program had only $9.9 billion of remaining bor-rowing authority. It is time to get serious about re-forming this broken system and reform it for a changing climate and for changing coasts—the things we know are coming at us. The current system often leaves homeowners no option but to rebuild the same building in the same place on the flooded property. CRS estimates that only about 2 per-cent of current NFIP-related properties are considered repetitive loss or severe repetitive loss properties—only 2 per-cent, but that 2 percent accounts for 16 percent of claims, $9 billion. Over the life of the NFIP, those repetitive loss or severe repetitive loss properties have totaled around 30 percent of all claims, about $17 billion. Insurance should allow homeowners to walk away from flood-torn struc-tures and go find new, safer homes. Currently, only States or municipali-ties can use FEMA to arrange buyouts of flood-prone properties. FEMA then provides up to 75 percent of funding for the local government to buy the prop-erty at fair market value, and then it becomes open space. But the buyout process is cumbersome, it is bureau-cratic, it is not in the hands of the homeowners, and it doesn’t get much use. How many mayors and city coun-cils want to buy out and turn to public use valuable property that is a part of their tax base and encourage folks, po-tentially, to leave? The flood program should work with communities to plan for cost-effective resiliency to flooding, whether it is ele-vating properties, moving homes, or re-treating from rising seas. Homeowners should have these options. It is willful blindness to ignore this problem as seas continue to rise and storms be-come more unpredictable and fero-cious, and it is even worse when you compound it with false and erroneous mapping so that the warnings to these families are wrong. Property owners and communities deserve proper warning about the flood risks they face, and they deserve alter-natives to simply rebuilding the same building in the same place so that it can be flooded again and again and again, which the program now forces them to do. With so much at risk for American families, it is time to wake up and put in place a smart and reliable system once and for all. I yield the floor, with my gratitude to the distinguished senior Senator from New Jersey in joining me here today. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Washington. f 
NOMINATION OF CHAI FELDBLUM Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to raise concerns about the unprecedented and partisan obstruction of a highly qualified nomi-nee to a critical agency. In this country, it is illegal to dis-criminate against someone in the workplace because of the traits that make them who they are—their race, religion, sex, disability, and more—and it is the Equal Employment Oppor-tunity Commission’s responsibility to enforce those laws and give every per-son the opportunity to make a living for themselves without fear of dis-crimination or harassment. Right now, a single Republican Sen-ator is threatening to derail the con-firmation of Ms. Feldblum for another term on the EEOC. Ms. Feldblum has served two terms on the EEOC, where she has earned the respect of her pro-fessional colleagues on both sides of the aisle. She has strong support from Republicans and Democrats in the Sen-ate, and she has been confirmed by this Senate twice. When it comes to independent boards and commissions, including the EEOC, the Senate has a longstanding practice of pairing nominees—one from the ma-jority party and one from the minority party. This is so important because it allows the minority party the oppor-tunity to have a voice. In this case, it allows my Democratic colleagues and me to ensure that employers are held accountable for workers’ rights and safety on the job. This practice is also important to bipartisanship in the Sen-ate. Part of that longstanding practice is that the majority cannot railroad

the nomination of a well-respected and well-qualified individual chosen by the minority. If Ms. Feldblum’s nomination is blocked by this Congress, it will be an unprecedented power grab by the ma-jority that would permanently shift the balance of power in the Senate. I hope all of my colleagues take seri-ously what it would mean if yet an-other power of the minority in the Sen-ate was taken away. Most importantly, if one Republican Senator insists on blocking Ms. Feldblum’s nomination, the work of the Equal Employment Op-portunity Commission—an agency workers rely on to protect their rights and safety on the job—is going to come to a grinding halt. Over the past 2 years, we have seen a shift in this country toward acknowl-edging and taking action against sex-ual assault and harassment, especially in the workplace. For far too long, this epidemic of powerful men taking ad-vantage of their subordinates, employ-ees, or those without a voice was swept under the rug. Women and men were told to brush it off or have a sense of humor or just endure the harassment or abuse they were facing in the work-place. Many did because they knew they would be punished, retaliated against, or even fired. After the Presidential election and the Women’s March, when so many women and men around the country made their voices heard and fought back against misogyny, sexism, rac-ism, and tilted the playing field that has favored those at the top for too long, we started to see women and men bravely come forward at a level we have never seen before to say ‘‘no more’’ and to speak out against their experiences of sexual assault and har-assment in the workplace. Because of that courage, a lot of pow-erful men in Hollywood, in the media, and in Congress have finally been held accountable for their actions, espe-cially when it came to using their power to take advantage of younger or less powerful women and men. For women and men in industries outside the spotlight—in hospitality, in technology, in farm fields, and in so many offices and workplaces around the country—there has not been the same kind of reckoning. For many of those workers, the EEOC is one of the very few places they can turn to. The EEOC is a resource for workers who need to file complaints of harassment or discrimination. It holds employers and businesses accountable for wide-spread discrimination and harassment. Again, because of the objection of a single Republican Senator, it is pos-sible now that the EEOC will be unable to conduct some of its most critical work. Here is what that means for workers in our country. The EEOC would no longer be able to bring some large cases when discrimination is part of employers’ general operating stand-ards. That often includes hiring prac-tices, equal pay, or sexual harassment. It means workers will not be able to file complaints to stop what happened to them from happening to anyone else. The EEOC would not be able to rule in cases where the Commission has not previously taken a position and a new policy must be created, and regional EEOC offices would not be able to hire expert witnesses in some cases, mean-ing that many cases would be stalled or even punted. This is not hypothetical. Without a quorum—without a quorum—the EEOC would not have been able to participate in the 2016 case against a tire company that refused to hire women for field po-sitions. After the EEOC intervened, that company settled with 46 women and implemented safeguards to prevent further discrimination. The EEOC also would not have been able to participate in a case against the outdoor store that discriminated against African Ameri-cans and Hispanic workers in hiring practices and retaliated against work-ers who stood up against unlawful practices. Workers around the country rely on the EEOC every day to intervene when they are being harassed, discriminated against, or unfairly treated at work. Whether they are being told they must work on their day of religious observ-ance or being told they cannot do a certain job because of their sex, the EEOC is there for them. In this moment when sexual assault and harassment in the workplace are at the forefront of our national con-versation, this is the wrong message to send to the American workers and their employees. We need to prove to the millions of women and men that we are taking the epidemic of harassment in the workplace seriously. I have spoken to many of my col-leagues on both sides of the aisle to make the case for confirming Ms. Feldblum before the end of this Con-gress. There is strong support on both sides of the aisle to get this done, with the exception of one lone Republican Senator. I urge my colleagues across the aisle to push aside this unprecedented ob-structionism, and I call on the Senate to move forward with confirming the full slate of nominees to the EEOC be-fore this Congress ends so the Commis-sion can continue to fulfill its duty to workers by enforcing protections and ensuring people are able to go to work and make a living without the fear of discrimination, harassment, or abuse. I hope that as we are confirming the EEOC nominees, the Senate will also confirm Mark Pearce to another term on the National Labor Relations Board. Like the EEOC, the Senate has a long history of confirming majority and mi-nority members to the Board in pairs. However, this year, Senate Republicans jammed through the majority members without reconfirming Mr. Pearce, al-lowing a minority seat to sit empty. Mr. Pearce is extremely qualified and has a long track record of serving his country for 8 years now as a member of the Board. He has a distinguished back-ground representing unions and work-ers. Right now, when the Republican Board members are rushing decisions through that chip away workers’ rights, even violating ethics pledges to do so, it is clear that the Board could benefit from his knowledge and exper-tise and voice for workers. As I have told my colleagues across the aisle, I will not allow the Senate to jam through any HELP Committee nominees until Mr. Pearce and Ms. Feldblum are reconfirmed to their po-sitions on the Board and the EEOC.

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST— EXECUTIVE CALENDAR Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the HELP Committee be discharged from further consideration of PN 1318 and the Sen-ate proceed to the en bloc consider-ation of the following nominations: PN 1318, Executive Calendar Nos. 379 and 381; and that the Senate vote on the nominations en bloc with no inter-vening action or debate. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Utah. Mr. LEE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I first want to note that it has been suggested that there is only one objection to Chai Feldblum’s nomination to the EEOC. That is not true. I am among those objectors; I am not the lone objector. My objection to this nominee relates to my belief and religious freedom. You see, religious freedom is very impor-tant to me. I am the descendant of peo-ple who were ordered exterminated by the Governor of Missouri on October 27, 1837. Religious intolerance cannot be tolerated in this country, and I see a growing wave of religious intolerance. I see a growing wave of sentiment of peo-ple suggesting that on the basis of peo-ple’s religious beliefs, they can be sub-ject to adverse government decision-making. Ms. Feldblum has written that she sees a conflict between religious belief and LGBT liberty as ‘‘a zero-sum game’’ where ‘‘a gain for one side nec-essarily entails a corresponding loss for the other side.’’ I see no reason why that should be the case, and I think that is fundamentally incompatible with our Nation’s long tradition of plu-ralism and religious freedom. Make no mistake—there is no mys-tery about which side Ms. Feldblum thinks should win. In a separate speech, she said: ‘‘There can be a con-flict between religious liberty and sex-ual liberty, but in almost all cases, the sexual liberty should win. . . . I’m hav-ing a hard time coming up with any case in which religious liberty should win.’’ I find these remarks stunning, espe-cially because an entire amendment to the U.S. Constitution—the very first one, by the way—is devoted to reli-gious liberty. These are not the words

of an open-minded jurist. These are not the words of an open-minded lawyer. These are the words of an activist in-tent on stamping out all opposition to her cause. In fact, she has even said as much. She said: ‘‘[G]ranting liberty to gay people . . . cannot be adequately advanced if ‘pockets of resistance’ are permitted to flourish.’’ Who is she to decide whether someone should be per-mitted to persist in their own religious belief simply because those beliefs hap-pen to conflict with a particular polit-ical world view? As an EEO Commissioner, Ms. Feldblum would be in a prime position to stamp out those pockets of resist-ance. She herself has noted: 
The EEOC has jurisdiction only over em-ployment. But other Federal agencies that enforce sex discrimination provisions often look to our interpretation for guidance in in-terpreting the laws they enforce. 
The Federal Government should never be used as a tool to stamp out re-ligious liberty—that principle which is so central to our Nation’s founding and to human happiness itself. It is so im-portant that we have to stand behind it. Ms. Feldblum, however, wants to deny exactly that. On that basis, I ob-ject to her confirmation. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-tion is heard. 
f 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST— EXECUTIVE CALENDAR Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I offer up a counteroffer. I am fine with the other two EEOC Commissioners. If that is what we are worried about—the ability of the EEOC to do its business—fine. I ask unanimous consent that the Sen-ate proceed to the en bloc consider-ation of the following nominations: Ex-ecutive Calendar Nos. 379 and 381; and that the Senate vote on the nomina-tions en bloc with no intervening ac-tion or debate Mr. President. Is there objection? Mrs. MURRAY. I object. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-tion is heard. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from New Hampshire Ms. HASSAN. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in urging approval of Chai Feldblum. The EEOC is a vital bipartisan agency that en-forces workers’ civil rights and helps protect them from harassment and dis-crimination while on the job. The EEOC has long operated with bipar-tisan support and requires a quorum of its five members to decide the cases be-fore the Agency—cases which include racial discrimination, gender discrimi-nation, age discrimination, and the abuse of people who experience disabil-ities. As my colleague from Wash-ington noted, it decides cases of sexual harassment as well. In short, the EEOC operates to pro-tect hard-working people who want a fair shot in the workplace. Blocking this nominee prevents the EEOC from carrying out the work it is tasked to do. It is bringing an unnecessary level of partisanship to a previously bipar-tisan process. Ms. Feldblum is a highly qualified nominee. She has already been con-firmed to the EEOC twice by the U.S. Senate, receiving support from Demo-crats and Republicans alike. She is also the first and only openly LGBTQ per-son to serve on the Commission. After being nominated by President Trump for another term last year, it is time that we finally move forward with Ms. Feldblum’s nomination. We need to stop these games, and we need to allow the EEOC to fully carry out its duties. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Arkansas. f 
WOMEN’S ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT ACT OF 2018 Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consider-ation of Calendar No. 683, S. 3247. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title. The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: 
A bill (S. 3247) to improve programs and ac-tivities relating to women’s entrepreneur-ship and economic empowerment that are carried out by the United States Agency for International Development, and for other purposes. 
There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill, which had been reported from the Committee on Foreign Relations, with an amend-ment to strike all after the enacting clause and insert in lieu thereof the following: 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Women’s Entre-preneurship and Economic Empowerment Act of 2018’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: (1) Because women make up the majority of the world’s poor and gender inequalities prevail in incomes, wages, access to finance, ownership of assets, and control over the allocation of re-sources, women’s entrepreneurship and eco-nomic empowerment is important to achieve in-clusive economic growth at all levels of society. (2) Research shows that when women exert greater influence over household finances, eco-nomic outcomes for families improve, and child-hood survival rates, food security, and edu-cational attainment increase. Women also tend to place a greater emphasis on household sav-ings which improves family financial resiliency. (3) A 2016 report by the McKinsey Global In-stitute estimated that achieving global gender parity in economic activity could add as much as $28,000,000,000,000 to annual global gross do-mestic product by 2025. (4) Lack of access to financial services that address gender-specific constraints impedes women’s economic inclusion. Roughly 1,000,000,000 women around the world are cur-rently left out of the formal financial system, which causes many women to rely on informal means of saving and borrowing that are riskier and less reliable. (5) Among other consequences, this lack of ac-cess hampers the success of women entre-preneurs, including women who are seeking to run or grow small and medium-sized enterprises. The International Finance Corporation has esti-mated that 70 percent of women-owned small and medium-sized enterprises in the formal sec-tor are unserved or underserved in terms of ac-cess to financial services, resulting in a financ-ing gap of $300,000,000,000 for women-owned small businesses. (6) Women’s economic empowerment is inex-tricably linked to a myriad of other women’s human rights that are essential to their ability to thrive as economic actors across the lifecycle, including— (A) living lives free of violence and exploi-tation; (B) achieving the highest possible standard of health and well-being; (C) enjoying full legal and human rights, such as access to registration, identification, and citi-zenship documents; (D) benefitting from formal and informal edu-cation; (E) equal protection of and access to land and property rights; (F) access to fundamental labor rights; (G) policies to address disproportionate care burdens; and (H) business and management skills and lead-ership opportunities. (7) Discriminatory legal and regulatory sys-tems and banking practices are obstacles to women’s access to capital and assets, including land, machinery, production facilities, tech-nology, and human resources. These barriers are often connected to a woman’s marital sta-tus, which can determine whether she is able to inherit land or own property in her name. These constraints contribute to women frequently run-ning smaller businesses, with fewer employees and lower asset values. (8) Savings groups primarily comprised of women are recognized as a vital entry point, es-pecially for poor and very poor women, to for-mal financial services. There is a high demand for such groups to protect and grow the savings of women with formal financial institutions. (9) Evidence shows that, once a saving group is linked to a bank, the average savings per member increases between 40 to 100 percent and the average profit per member doubles. Investing in financial literacy, business leadership train-ing, and mentorship are key elements to these outcomes. (10) United States support for microenterprise and microfinance development programs, which seek to reduce poverty in low-income countries by giving small loans to small-scale entre-preneurs without collateral, have been a useful mechanism to help families weather economic shocks, but many microcredit borrowers largely remain in poverty. (11) The vast majority of microcredit bor-rowers are women who would like to move up the economic ladder, but are held back by bind-ing constraints that create a missing middle – large numbers of microenterprises, a handful of large firms or conglomerates, and very few small and medium-sized enterprises in between, which are critical to driving economic growth in devel-oping countries. (12) According to the World Bank, small and medium-sized enterprises create 4 out of 5 new positions in emerging markets, but approxi-mately 50 percent of formal small and medium- sized enterprises lack access to formal credit. The financing gap is even larger when micro and informal enterprises are taken into account. Overall, approximately 70 percent of all micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises in emerging markets lack access to credit.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES7866 December 19, 2018 
Senator M ARKEY and his staff, for their incredibly hard work on this bill and their efforts to get this bill over the finish line. I believe we have set a strong example of how major foreign policy can be accomplished in a very thorough and bipartisan fashion, and I look forward to our next effort to-gether. I also want to thank Senators C
ARDIN  and R
UBIO and their staffs, as well, for early and consistent support on this ef-fort. Thanks go to the Senate Foreign Re-lations Committee chairman, Senator C
ORKER , the ranking member, B OB M
ENENDEZ , and their staffs for helping to shepherd this effort through the Foreign Relations Committee, where ARIA passed unanimously on Sep-tember 26, 2018. I want to thank and extend my grati-tude to the majority leader, K
EVIN M
CCARTHY , and his staff for their hard work to pass this bill through the House of Representatives with only minimal changes, by voice vote, last week. Leader M
CCONNELL and his staff took an early interest in this effort, and it could not have been done without their support. I am grateful to Leader S
TENY  H
OYER , the chairman and ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, E
DROYCE and E LIOT E
NGEL , and Representative I LLEANA  R
OS-LEHTINEN for their support. Nearly 2 years in the making, the Gardner-Markey ARIA Initiative will establish a generational, multifaceted, and principled U.S. policy in the Indo- Pacific region, a region that is vital for U.S. national security and economic interests. ARIA is important because the Indo-Pacific is home to half of the world’s population, half of the world’s GDP, the world’s largest standing ar-mies, and six U.S. defense treaty allies. The security and economic future of the United States depends on having the right policies to ensure a free and open Indo-Pacific. Therefore, the Gard-ner-Markey ARIA establishes and pro-vides new resources for a long-term strategy to enhance security coopera-tion with our allies and establishes the Asia-Pacific security initiative. It promotes American businesses through trade opportunities, projects American values of democracy, human rights, and the rule of law throughout the Indo-Pacific. It is a bill designed to drive U.S. leadership as other powers turn to economic colonialism. Starting in June 2017, Senator M
AR-
KEYand I have held over five hearings at the East Asia and Pacific Sub-committee to inform this legislation. The hearings examined a range of na-tional security, economic, and rule of law challenges in the Indo-Pacific and culminated in a final hearing with State Department and Department of Defense officials to allow the adminis-tration to express its views on ARIA. We introduced ARIA on April 24 of this year with a bipartisan group that included Senators RUBIO, CARDIN , and Y
OUNG . On June 21, we received a letter signed by Secretary Pompeo and Sec-retary Mattis formally endorsing ARIA. The letter states: 
[We] value the ARIA legislation’s reaffir-mation of the United States’ security com-mitments to our Indo-Pacific allies and part-ners. Furthermore, ARIA’s focus on pro-moting stronger regional economic engage-ment—and its support for democracy, the rule of law, and the development of civil so-ciety—is especially welcome as part of a dip-lomatically-led whole-of-government ap-proach to the Indo-Pacific region. 
The Gardner-Markey ARIA passed the Foreign Relations Committee unanimously on September 26. It passed unanimously on the floor of the Senate on December 4, and the House passed ARIA by voice vote, as I men-tioned, December 12. This bill is a rare piece of bipartisan legislation that enjoys broad support in the Congress and the White House but is also strongly supported by the business community and policy ex-perts. On June 4, the Wall Street Journal editorial board endorsed ARIA, stating: 
Congress is trying to help with the bipar-tisan Asia Reassurance Initiative Act. . . . The Senate bill affirms core American alli-ances with Australia, Japan, and South Korea, while calling for deeper military and economic ties with India and Taiwan. It no-tably encourages regular weapons sales to Taipei. 
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has also endorsed ARIA, stating: 
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce supports the ‘‘Asia Reassurance Initiative Act of 2018’’ and thanks Senator Gardner [and Markey] for [their] efforts to strengthen U.S. stra-tegic and economic relationships across the Indo-Pacific region. Particularly with regard to the legisla-tion’s economic goals, we appreciate the bill’s focus on closer trade ties, stronger pro-tections for intellectual property, and a re-newed focus on trade facilitation. 
The Heritage Foundation wrote on December 6: 
Don’t look now, but a sweeping bill with bipartisan support in Congress and the back-ing of the Trump administration is one step closer to becoming reality. The Asia Reas-surance Initiative Act, introduced by Sen. Cory Gardner . . . along with key cosponsors Ed Markey . . . and Marco Rubio . . . passed the Senate on Wednesday. This was a wel-come display of leadership. 
In these partisan times, the bill has garnered support from both current and former administration officials and experts across the political spectrum. As the Singapore-based Straits Times wrote on December 13: 
Under the Obama administration, there was a big rhetorical commitment to the Asia Pacific or Indo-Pacific region, but the US ‘‘just flat out did not readjust our resources in a way that actually backed that up,’’ said Dr. Lindsey Ford, Director of Political-Secu-rity Affairs for the Asia Society Policy Insti-tute. The ARIA marks an important start to rectifying that, she said. ‘‘The ARIA . . . if passed, would be prob-ably one of the most consequential pieces of funding legislation that has to do with Asia, that US Congress would have passed in years,’’ Dr. Ford told Straits Times. When you have the Heritage Founda-tion and former Obama administration officials on the same page, you know we have done something right. So again, I want to congratulate this body—truly the world’s most delibera-tive Chamber, as this bill has proved— for this bipartisan victory, and I hope the President will sign this important bill into law shortly. Again, I want to thank my colleague, Senator M
ARKEY , for his tremendous leadership on this. I yield the floor to Senator M
ARKEY . Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Colorado, and I rise to echo the sentiments of the Senator from Colorado. I first want to thank the Senator for all of his great work on this bill, for all of the hearings that took place in the subcommittee, all of the various inter-est groups who had to be worked with in order to make sure that this bill came to pass. So I just want to thank the Senator from Colorado and thank his staff for the great work. This bill is a historic bill. It is a very important bill. It could not have hap-pened without the Senator, and I thank him for all of his incredible leadership on this issue. I want to thank my own staff for all of their great work on this issue as well. We had an incredible bipartisan part-nership that was created between the Senator from Colorado and the Senator from Massachusetts, but our staffs worked very closely together. This bill, the Gardner-Markey Asia Reassurance Initiative Act, is a very important bill, and I want to speak about this bill, but in doing so, I am actually speaking about something that is broader, something more impor-tant, something of more lasting con-sequence to international peace and stability, and something more critical to the economic well-being, security, and fundamental rights of Americans and millions of others around the globe. America has always had an impor-tant relationship with the Indo-Pacific region, but the global landscape is changing, and today, more than ever, the Indo-Pacific is the most consequen-tial region, not only for the United States but also for the rest of the world, and that is what this bill is all about. It is how we in the U.S. Con-gress can reaffirm that we, No. 1, are and will remain committed to the Indo- Pacific; No. 2, recognize its shifting dy-namics and the significance these changes represent; and No. 3, stand ready to marshal the leadership and re-sources necessary to address the chal-lenges we face and capitalize on the op-portunities before us. With that in mind, I again want to extend my gratitude to my partner in this endeavor, Senator G
ARDNER . He has been the best possible partner in this effort, and I want to thank him for everything he has done.

OYCE and C ASTRO and Y OHOfor their work as well. That list of Members is not only indicative of the level of bi-partisanship there is in Congress but also on U.S.-Asia policy. This bill would not have been possible without them, and it would not have been pos-sible without, again, the wonderful staffs we are blessed to have working on these issues, who spent many long hours advocating for key American in-terests and values in this legislation. This bill represents a generational policy framework to enhance U.S. lead-ership in the Indo-Pacific and is a dem-onstration of American commitment to a free and open region, as well as the rules-based international order. Zach Hosford and Mark Appleton on my staff dedicated the last year to working and partnering with the Sen-ator. So I am pleased that the Gardner- Markey Asia Reassurance Initiative will pass the Senate today, and I look forward to its being sent on to the President’s desk. I again thank Senator G

RECOGNIZING THE EAST MIS-SISSIPPI LIONS, NJCAA CHAMPS Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I rise for a long overdue floor speech to recog-nize a school in my home State of Mis-sissippi that continues to win national football championships, five, in fact, over the past 10 years. I can assure my friends from Ala-bama that I am not trying to steal the thunder from the Crimson Tide. I am here to recognize the undefeated East Mississippi Community College Lions, who have become their own football dynasty and are the reigning National Junior College Athletic Association champs. NJCAA is commonly known as JUCO. What makes the East Mississippi Community College football program special is the grit and determination that fuels its success. Some of these players are truly playing for their lives. They are the comeback kids, ris-ing above adversity to get back into the game. The stories of these players are so inspirational that they won over the hearts of Americans in the Netflix documentary series, ‘‘Last Chance U.’’ In the first two seasons of that pro-gram, viewers had a prime spot in the bleachers to watch East Mississippi’s 2015 and 2016 football seasons. I will not reveal any spoilers, but the Lions have undeniable star power. One of the compelling themes throughout the show is the belief in second chances. Past misbehavior or poor grades do not define these players or their futures. They have legions of fans cheering for their success and for the next touchdown. They have intro-duced to the Nation, if not the world, the small Mississippi town of Scooba, population 700. According to the show’s trailer, ‘‘One of football’s best recruit-ing grounds is a place you’ve never heard of,’’ but now the secret is out. I would like to congratulate the East Mississippi Lions as this year’s JUCO champions and recognize the leader-ship of the head coach, Buddy Ste-phens, who only this afternoon was named National Coach of the Year for junior college football. I also want to congratulate East Mis-sissippi’s six All-Americans this year, which was the most for any school ex-cept Iowa Western, which tied with them. These All-Americans include first team All-American wide receiver Dontario Drummond and second team running back Deon McIntosh, offensive lineman LaQuinston Sharp, and defen-sive lineman Everitt Cunningham. Honorable mentions went to quarter-back Messiah deWeaver and return spe-cialist DJ Clayton. There have been 32 All-Americans during Coach Stephens’ 11-season tenure with the Lions. Many East Mississippi players go on to 4-year universities and even pro football teams. LaGarrette Blount, running back for the Detroit Lions and a three-time Super Bowl champion, was a former East Mississippi Lion, and so was defensive back C.J. Reavis, who plays for the Jacksonville Jag-uars. Other alumni currently playing in the NFL are defensive lineman Jarran Reed for the Seattle Seahawks, Za’Darius Smith for the Baltimore Ravens, Denico Autry for the Indianap-olis Colts, and D.J. Jones for the San Francisco 49ers. Although there is no question about East Mississippi’s skills on the field, the team also earned the title of being the Football Academic Team of the Year among junior colleges, showing that the work goes far past the end zone. Our State and Nation are proud of East Mississippi Community College’s success. I am confident their football dynasty will continue, and I look for-ward to cheering them on to other championships in future years. I thank the Presiding Officer. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. D
AINES ). The Senator from Delaware.

U.N. FRAMEWORK CONVENTION ON CLIMATE CHANGE Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise today with two of our colleagues, Sen-ator E
DMARKEY and Senator J EFF MERKLEY , to reflect on the 24th session of the United Nations Framework Con-vention on Climate Change that con-cluded just this last weekend in the country of Poland. This important conference, which is better known as COP24, refers to Con-ference of Parties 24. I think they have been meeting for 24 years. They met there for 2 weeks as leaders from near-ly 200 nations, working to reach an agreement on how our world will actu-ally implement the Paris climate agreement. The stakes could not be higher. I am not one, as my colleagues know, given to hyperbole, but the future of our planet and the future of our children and grandchildren may well hang in the balance. Was it a positive step forward that the international community could come together and agree to meaningful action to combat climate change on a global scale by finally getting to im-plement the Paris Agreement? Yes, it was. Having said that, this agreement is not perfect, they know it, and we know it. No one is pretending that it is. It falls well short of the steps that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the IPCC, determined just 1 month ago are needed to avoid the most catastrophic effects of climate change over the next decade. The entire world needs to do even more to address this problem. That in-cludes setting much more aggressive emissions reduction targets going for-ward to address the challenges of cli-mate change in the years ahead. While we certainly can and should be doing more, though, this agreement is cause for hope that bolder future agreements are achievable, but reaching bolder fu-ture agreements is going to require real leadership from leaders and from nations across the world. After all, leadership is the biggest key to success for almost any organization or endeav-or, and that includes saving this plan-et. Unfortunately, our President, along with many in his administration, con-tinue to reject climate science and deny the reality and the magnitude of the challenges we are facing. Well, here is the reality. According to NOAA, the United States experienced 16 extreme weather- related disasters in 2017 that exceeded $1 billion apiece. In the past year alone, Americans paid $306 billion in damages due to storm surges, flooding, wildfires, crop freezes, and droughts—a new record. Thirteen of our Nation’s leading sci-entific Federal agencies recently re-ported to us in a National Climate As-sessment that if we do nothing to ad-dress our climate emissions, today’s extreme weather-related events will pale in comparison to what lies ahead. Here is a sampling of what we can look forward to if we do nothing—if we don’t do enough. In the future, we can continue to expect rainfall or precipi-tation as measured by the foot, not by

the inch. We can continue to expect more wildfires in places out West, burning areas larger than my home State of Delaware. We can continue to expect extreme flooding to devastate communities like Ellicott City, MD, not too far from here, which has been hit by not one but two 1,000-year floods in the past 2 years alone. Think about that. Somebody asked me the other day: What is a 1,000-year flood? It is some-thing that is supposed to happen only once in 1,000 years. They have seen two of them in Ellicott City in the past 2 years. One of the most memorable lyrics from my youth and maybe for some of the others in this Chamber comes from a guy named Stephen Stills. I would describe him as a California-based cli-matologist. He is not. He is a singer- songwriter from Buffalo Springfield fame and Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young. He once wrote a lyric that goes like this: 
Something’s happening here. Just what it is ain’t exactly clear. 
Think about that. 
Something’s happening here. Just what it is ain’t exactly clear. 
Well, make no mistake, something is happening here, and what is happening here is exactly clear. What is also clear is, there is still time to do something about it while actually fostering eco-nomic growth in the United States and beyond our borders. Let me say that again. Here is the good news: What is also clear is that there is still time to do something about it while actually fostering economic growth in the United States and beyond our borders. Climate scientists aren’t part of some grand hoax. It isn’t some alarmist pre-diction. It doesn’t come from some left-leaning organization. It doesn’t come from talk radio. The truth is that it comes directly from our Nation’s leading scientists and leading sci-entists around the world. We also remind our colleagues that the National Climate Assessment is not developed at the direction or whim of any one person or any one adminis-tration; it was Congress that passed a law mandating that the National Cli-mate Assessment be presented every 4 years. We did it. Congress did it. That law was called the Global Change Re-search Act of 1990. It passed this Sen-ate in 1990 unanimously, and it was signed into law by the late President George Herbert Walker Bush, a Repub-lican. Our Nation’s leading scientists warned us yet again less than a month ago that if we failed to start seriously reducing carbon emissions now, by the end of this century, we may well be witnessing the following tale of horribles. Here is a chart. First, it deals with sea levels rising 6 feet. That is a lot. Since 1993, it has risen 3 inches. Com-pared to what we have experienced in the last 25 years, that is a heck of a lot. We would expect that if sea level rise does go to 6 feet, it would result in some $3.6 trillion in cumulative dam-ages to the U.S. coastal properties and infrastructure. Most of our east coast would be underwater, including maybe parts of the lowest lying State in America, which is Delaware. Our next chart talks about annual economic losses of up to $500 billion by 2090—not cumulative but every year. We have another chart here that speaks to gross domestic product. You may recall that when we fell into the great recession around 10 years ago— the worst recession since the Great De-pression—we saw GDP losses of just over 4 percent. It was horrible. Banks stopped lending money. The unemploy-ment rate was 10 percent or more. Peo-ple couldn’t get loans for anything. That is where we were. If these estimates from some of the best, smartest scientists in the world are correct, it is not going to be losses at 4 percent; we will be looking at 10 percent by 2100. No Member of this Senate is going to be around then, but these pages sitting down here will be. Our grandsons and granddaughters may well be around too. As the world works to develop mean-ingful solutions to mitigate these ef-fects of climate change, the Trump ad-ministration chooses to exacerbate the problem by doubling down on dirty and outdated energy policies. This adminis-tration is also attempting to discredit the recent science reports by pushing talking points from well-known cli-mate deniers. Americans are not falling for these tricks anymore. Americans are wit-nessing firsthand the effects of climate change in their communities every day. They want action, and they want us to be part of that action. So does the business community. While this admin-istration sits on its hands, American businesses are actually stepping up in a big way to combat the effects of cli-mate change. Many businesses stand ready to do even more. They are look-ing to us here in our Nation’s Capital to provide some leadership. To our international friends around the world who are wondering where our Nation is on climate change, I want to say to those folks that, speaking on be-half of the majority of not just Dela-wareans but Americans, we are with you. We support the Paris climate agreement. We want to reduce carbon emissions because we are convinced that doing so will enable us to save our planet and create jobs. This is not a Democratic or Repub-lican issue. This is not a blue State or red State issue. It affects us all. If you think climate change hasn’t reached your State yet, the science is clear that eventually it will. Luckily for us, young people are leading the call for action. Climate change and environmental issues are often mistakenly forgotten when we discuss domestic issues. In today’s news cycle, especially under this ad-ministration, they doesn’t always make headlines. It has oftentimes been said that climate change is not an issue that drives Americans to the polls. I think that is changing. Young people led the way to chang-ing our country before. I remember when I was your age, I say to our pages. In the 1950s, we led the decades- long civil rights movement for equal rights for every American under the law. Young activists made clear their opposition to the Vietnam war. Back in the 1970s, when I was actually serving during the Vietnam war as a naval flight officer, young people pushed hard for strong environmental standards. The Cuyahoga River in Cleveland, OH— north of Ohio State where I went to school—was on fire. At the same time, we had shores of our country littered with garbage. Our country is back at another one of those make-or-break moments in our history. We need the energy of Ameri-cans of all ages, young and old, to make sure we don’t blow it. We need to listen to them all, especially to our younger Americans. After all, when you think about it, they should be en-ergized by this. It is their planet, and it is their future. When it comes to global challenges, such as terrorism and cyber attacks, the United States doesn’t sit back and wait for someone else to lead the way; we step up and we lead. We have many dogs in this fight—some big ones and some not-so-big ones. We have a lot at stake. Fortunately, acting sooner rather than later on climate change brings with it a number of positives. We can put our country on course to reduce emissions while growing our economy. I keep coming back to this theme, and it is an important theme. We can put our country on a course to reduce emissions and grow our economy. The two are not mutually exclusive—I don’t care what some people say and would have us believe. In fact, it is quite the opposite. They are not mutu-ally exclusive. What we can and should be doing is using our energy and resources to fos-ter new economic opportunities for communities that may be dependent today on the old world order. In 2017, nearly 3.2 million Americans were working in wind, solar, energy ef-ficiency, and other clean energy jobs. A year or two ago, one of them was one of our sons. Our oldest son worked for 6 years or so helping develop ways for large buildings all over the Northeast to conserve energy. That was one of the jobs. There are 3.2 million jobs. More jobs will follow, and it is incumbent on us to ensure that some of those new jobs go to people whose jobs are going away as we seek to reduce carbon emissions in this country and on our planet. How would we feel if we lost our jobs and at the same time, 3 million people gained jobs? How about me? I was born in West Virginia. Dad was a coal miner for a while earlier in his life. How

about those people? We need to make sure that when we make progress re-ducing carbon emissions, we don’t for-get folks who lose their jobs because of the reduction of those carbon emis-sions. We have to reach back and help them too. We don’t have the luxury of waiting around. We need to crank it up, and we need to get going. That is why, as the senior Democrat and ranking member of the Committee on Environment and Public Works, which I serve on with Senators M
ARKEY , MERKLEY , and oth-ers, I am anxious to join them to help lead the fight for policies that take this country into a brighter climate fu-ture. If we are honest with our children and grandchildren, we don’t have any other choice. It was my hope that on the world stage this week, America’s representa-tive at COP24 would make clear that our country is ready to lead by exam-ple. Unfortunately, they apparently did not. That is no reason to despair. We have the facts, and I think we have the energy and the commitment on our side. Today, I want to leave our colleagues with this message: Climate action should not be an issue that divides us; it should be an issue that unites us. It should unite not just this country but the entire global community. Our world could definitely use more unifi-cation these days, and so could our country. Years from now, when our sons’ chil-dren are dealing with the inevitable consequences of our failure to address climate change—if we do fail—there will be a day when they might come to me or, frankly, any of us and say: Well, you were a Senator, weren’t you, Grandpa? What did you do when you had the chance to do something about this impending disaster when there was still time? What did you do about it? We should all want to be able to say the same thing: I worked tirelessly re-minding, warning my colleagues, push-ing my colleagues. We moved Heaven and Earth to make sure that future generations could inherit a safe, healthy planet, one where their dreams and aspirations could be realized and not destroyed. My colleagues and I—especially Sen-ator M
ARKEY and Senator M ERKLEY — are on the floor to make it clear that the overwhelming majority of Ameri-cans stand with every other nation in the world on this issue. We need to act. We need to act now. Time is not on our side. Let’s seize the day. Carpe diem. I am happy to yield the floor. It is like preaching to the choir. No-body has done more in this body and the Congress in the last 15 years than this man here—Senator E
DMARKEY  from Massachusetts—to try to make sure that we realize this is a problem, that we do something about it, and that we do something about it soon and in a way that creates economic oppor-tunity. I thank you. It is a pleasure to stand in front of you and serve beside you. Mr. MARKEY. I thank Bishop CAR-
PER—I mean Senator C ARPER as I con-tinue preaching to the choir. There is no one who does it better than you do, and we have to continue to do this in-sistently, persistently, and constantly to make sure this message is heard. We thank you for all of your great leader-ship, Senator C
ARPER . Senator M
ERKLEY will be joining us out here on the floor. We have so many other Members who are completely committed to this issue. It is abso-lutely essential that we make progress in 2019 and 2020 on this issue. We are speaking on the floor today about the just-concluded international climate negotiations in Poland—also called COP24. That means conference of parties. That means every nation on Earth. Twenty-four. The 24 times that every nation on Earth met to preserve the Earth, to make sure that this great gift God gave us is, in fact, passed on better than we found it and not poten-tially at great risk because we did not act. Unfortunately, given the focus of the Trump administration at the climate conference, you could say that we are here on the Senate floor not for a col-loquy but for ‘‘coal-oquy’’—a discus-sion about the role of coal in our soci-ety. In a shameful moment for our coun-try in the history of international cli-mate negotiations, the United States formed a gaslighting group with Ku-wait, Russia, and Saudi Arabia to downplay the findings on climate change while at the talks in Poland. Despite the fact that in the IPCC’s special report—the U.N.’s special re-port—on 1.5 degrees Celsius, the world’s scientists tell us that coal without carbon capture must be com-pletely eliminated as a source of power by the year 2050, the United States, un-fortunately, held an official event cele-brating dirty fossil fuels, with no solu-tion to the problem. That is the Trump administration. President Trump, I think, got his de-gree in climate science from Trump University, and the diplomas were handed out by the Koch brothers. This is the problem. It is not the coal min-ers. We have to make sure that we take care of the coal miners. We have to make sure that they get the healthcare they need, the pensions they need. There is a revolution going on. It is a renewables revolution, and it is an all- electric vehicle revolution. This ad-ministration has been trying as hard as it can to stop it, to slow it down, even as the planet gets dangerously warm. Fortunately, for the planet, the international community set the rules of the road for implementing the Paris climate agreement despite the misin-formation being peddled by the Trump administration. The global community was in agreement in its belief in the science of climate. Now we have a new rule book based on the international consensus for making progress toward the goals outlined in the Paris climate agreement. What happened in Poland was an im-portant milestone for the planet. When Donald Trump announced that the United States would withdraw from the Paris Agreement, he defied the wishes of the majority of Americans and of many of our biggest business leaders because they know that being a part of the Paris Agreement makes America more competitive. It will create new jobs, open up new markets, catalyze economic growth, and reduce business risks. The Trump administration’s de-cision to pull the United States from the Paris accord continues to be a grave, unforced error that will have massive implications for our economy, for our security, for our public health, and for our future. The new Conference of the Parties’ rule book—the new meeting of every country in the world—makes the Paris Agreement stronger than ever, but the United States wants the rules to sim-ply allow us to sit out the game. By the ‘‘United States,’’ I mean the Trump ad-ministration, representing the Federal Government. Yet it doesn’t represent the people. It doesn’t represent the States. It doesn’t represent the cities. It doesn’t represent all of the busi-nesses in our country that are moving on renewables, that are moving on this dramatic change. Recently released scientific studies make clear that as one of the world’s greatest polluters, the United States cannot sit on the sidelines. You cannot preach temperance from a bar stool. You cannot tell the rest of the world to do something while you yourself are al-lowing all of these emissions to go up into the atmosphere. Of the 17 hottest years on record, 16 have occurred since the year 2000. At the rate we are warm-ing, the world is on course to breach 1.5-degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels by the year 2030. The National Climate Assessment warns that the Northeast will warm faster than any other region in the United States, breaching 2-degrees of warming above preindustrial levels of 2035. In other words, the Gulf of Maine—Massachusetts Bay—is the sec-ond fastest warming body of water on the planet after the Arctic. That is dangerous. What it means is that we could have a total loss of coral reefs, the doubling in loss of plant and ani-mal species, a loss of up to one-tenth of U.S. GDP—more than double the losses of the great recession by 2100. Senator C
ARPER already laid all of this out in graphic detail for the Mem-bers to see and for the American people to see. When asked about the conclu-sions from his own administration’s scientists on climate change, President Trump said: I don’t believe my own sci-entists on climate action. The world no longer sees the Amer-ican President as Commander in Chief; it sees a climate denier in chief sitting in the Oval Office. Thankfully, America’s climate sci-entists are fighting for us. The world’s scientists are fighting for us, and we

must fight for them. We must fight ef-forts to censor their research. We must fight the efforts to ax their budgets. We must fight for them because the work they do is essential to our plan-et’s future. One only has to look at the litany of sins perpetrated by the Trump admin-istration on climate science and cli-mate action to see how big of a fight we have. The list of this administra-tion’s efforts to weaken climate action, public health, and environmental rules is so long that Senator W
HITEHOUSE  and I had to publish a report to capture all of the ways Donald Trump has al-ready come to lead ‘‘The Most Anti-Cli-mate Administration in History.’’ This is the report. It just goes on. It is page after page of actions that the administration has taken to undermine the progress we should be making on climate. We just issued this report this week. There are more than 114 climate actions that President Trump and his Big Oil all-star team, at the Cabinet level in this administration, have put in place. That has been, literally, one attack per week over the past 2 years. During his tenure, President Trump nominated Andrew Wheeler, a member of the coal industry’s hall of fame, to run the Agency that is tasked with pro-tecting our environment. He has moved to freeze fuel economy standards at 2020 levels rather than pushing for the economically and technologically achievable goal of 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. While in the White House, the President, day by day, tries his best to make sure that no progress is made. Here is what I know. We went all the way from 1975 until 2007 with no new law being passed on fuel economy standards. In the House and in partnering with Members over here in the Senate, I was able to pass the in-crease in 2007 for fuel economy stand-ards. That was the first increase in 32 years. President Trump has proposed a clean powerplant replacement that would kill 1,400 more Americans every year and emit 12 times more carbon di-oxide. This list goes on and on. The only thing longer than the list of anti- climate and environmental actions taken by the Trump administration might be the number of investigations of the Trump administration. Unfortunately, in the absence of leadership from Trump’s Federal agen-cies, people wonder what is happening. Is there a reason for hope? The answer is yes. Our towns, our cities, our States haven’t missed a step. There are 22 States, 550 cities, and 900 companies with operations in the United States that have climate commitments in place. These pledgers could get us with-in striking distance of our original commitment in the Paris climate agreement. After the Waxman-Markey bill passed on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives and when President Obama went to Copenhagen, the prom-ise he made was the 17-percent reduc-tion by 2020, which was in the Waxman- Markey bill. That is the pledge, that 17 percent in the Waxman-Markey bill. We are still capable of coming very close to that, but we know that even the U.S. commitment in Paris of up to 28 percent in the years after that would be insufficient to limit the warming to 1.5 degrees by midcentury, so we need to be thinking beyond that. We need to get to net zero emissions by 2050. To get there, we will need to take unprecedented action. We need to supercharge our investments in a clean energy economy, and we need to do that at the Federal level. Globally, we need to cut greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030. We need to invest in en-ergy efficiency solutions to reduce the total energy demand by one-third. We need to transform our transportation system because as much as 65 percent of energy used in transportation will need to come from low-emission sources. At the same time, in the power sector, we need at least 75 per-cent of our electricity to come from clean sources by 2050. Getting there will not be easy, but we have the technologies that are nec-essary for this to be possible. We have the momentum in the markets to get renewable energy to every corner of this country. We are ushering our power sector into a clean energy future that is good for our environment and good for our economy, as Senator C
AR-
PERsaid. In the early 2020s, it could be cheaper to build new renewables from scratch than to continue operating old, dirty, coal-fired power plants. That is not a conspiracy; that is called com-petition. Adam Smith is smiling in his grave, looking at this competition unfold. The cost of solar has fallen 50 to 60 percent over the last 5 to 6 years. In fact, wind and solar are generally cheaper than coal and nuclear energy right now. That is not just happening here. Half of all electricity installed around the world last year was renewable. Let me say it again. Last year, half of all new electricity on the planet was renew-able. Renewable energy deployment around the world has increased by 8 percent a year for 7 years in a row, and there is no likelihood that it is going to change. Globally, more than 330 billion dol-lars was invested in clean energy just last year. This is a global clean energy race. It is a global job creation race, and we cannot let nations like China and India and others win that race. We have to push ourselves harder. Right now, we have more than 50,000 megawatts installed in the United States. By the end of 2022, we could have over 250,000 megawatts of wind and solar installed if we would just continue at the pace on which we are right now and don’t allow Donald Trump and his cronies to roll back those advances. We now have five times as many workers in the solar industry as we do in coal mining in the United States. In 2016, we added as many jobs in the solar industry as exist in the coal min-ing industry. By 2020, we will have 500,000 Americans working in wind and solar. Who are these workers? They are electricians. They are roofers. They are carpenters. They are blue-collar work-ers all across this country. We have un-leashed a blue-collar job revolution in this country. There are hundreds of thousands of people working in it with there being a direct assault from the White House going against those work-ers every single day. Blue-collar work-ers are workers who, right now, are five times larger in number than are the coal miners in our country. It will be machinists to build advanced fuel- efficient vehicles. It will be American electricians retrofitting energy-effi-cient buildings. It will be American roofers installing solar panels. Clean energy is the greatest force for blue- collar, high-wage job creation in a gen-eration. While we have a responsibility to protect the livelihoods of the millions of Americans who work in energy effi-ciency, clean energy, clean vehicles, and clean fuels, we need to make sure that those working in fossil fuel indus-tries are supported throughout this clean energy transition. I thank Senator MERKLEY . I thank Senator C
ARPER . I thank all of the Members who have worked on these issues that move us toward a 100-per-cent renewable future. We need a green new deal for our country. Now we just have to exert the political will to make it a reality. I thank everyone for all of their work on this issue. In 2019, we are going to raise every one of these climate issues in the context of a massive job creation effort. We are going to save all of cre-ation by engaging in massive blue-col-lar job creation in our country. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-jority leader.

Findings ‘‘The Congress finds the following: ‘‘(1) Individuals, businesses, and other or-ganizations have varying degrees of legal protection when providing information to the agencies for strictly statistical purposes. ‘‘(2) Pledges of confidentiality by agencies provide assurances to the public that infor-mation about individuals or organizations or provided by individuals or organizations for exclusively statistical purposes will be held in confidence and will not be used against such individuals or organizations in any agency action. ‘‘(3) Protecting the confidentiality inter-ests of individuals or organizations who pro-vide information under a pledge of confiden-tiality for Federal statistical programs serves both the interests of the public and the needs of society. ‘‘(4) Declining trust of the public in the protection of information provided under a pledge of confidentiality to the agencies ad-versely affects both the accuracy and com-pleteness of statistical analyses. ‘‘(5) Ensuring that information provided under a pledge of confidentiality for statis-tical purposes receives protection is essen-tial in continuing public cooperation in sta-tistical programs. ‘‘§ 3572. Confidential information protection ‘‘(a) PURPOSES .—The purposes of this sec-tion are the following: ‘‘(1) To ensure that information supplied by individuals or organizations to an agency for statistical purposes under a pledge of confidentiality is used exclusively for statis-tical purposes. ‘‘(2) To ensure that individuals or organiza-tions who supply information under a pledge of confidentiality to agencies for statistical purposes will neither have that information disclosed in identifiable form to anyone not authorized by this subchapter nor have that information used for any purpose other than a statistical purpose. ‘‘(3) To safeguard the confidentiality of in-dividually identifiable information acquired under a pledge of confidentiality for statis-tical purposes by controlling access to, and uses made of, such information. ‘‘(b) U
SE OF STATISTICAL DATA OR INFORMA -
TION.—Data or information acquired by an agency under a pledge of confidentiality and for exclusively statistical purposes shall be used by officers, employees, or agents of the agency exclusively for statistical purposes and protected in accordance with such pledge. ‘‘(c) D
ISCLOSURE OF STATISTICAL DATA OR  I
NFORMATION .— ‘‘(1) Data or information acquired by an agency under a pledge of confidentiality for exclusively statistical purposes shall not be disclosed by an agency in identifiable form, for any use other than an exclusively statis-tical purpose, except with the informed con-sent of the respondent. ‘‘(2) A disclosure pursuant to paragraph (1) is authorized only when the head of the agency approves such disclosure and the dis-closure is not prohibited by any other law. ‘‘(3) This section does not restrict or di-minish any confidentiality protections in law that otherwise apply to data or informa-tion acquired by an agency under a pledge of confidentiality for exclusively statistical purposes. ‘‘(d) R
ULE FOR USE OF DATA OR INFORMA -
TION FOR NONSTATISTICAL PURPOSES .—A sta- tistical agency or unit shall clearly distin-guish any data or information it collects for nonstatistical purposes (as authorized by law) and provide notice to the public, before the data or information is collected, that the data or information could be used for non-statistical purposes. ‘‘(e) D
ESIGNATION OF AGENTS .—A statistical agency or unit may designate agents, by con-tract or by entering into a special agreement containing the provisions required under sec-tion 3561(2) for treatment as an agent under that section, who may perform exclusively statistical activities, subject to the limita-tions and penalties described in this sub-chapter. ‘‘(f) F
INES AND PENALTIES .—Whoever, being an officer, employee, or agent of an agency acquiring information for exclusively statis-tical purposes, having taken and subscribed the oath of office, or having sworn to observe the limitations imposed by this section, comes into possession of such information by reason of his or her being an officer, em-ployee, or agent and, knowing that the dis-closure of the specific information is prohib-ited under the provisions of this subchapter, willfully discloses the information in any manner to a person or agency not entitled to receive it, shall be guilty of a class E felony and imprisoned for not more than 5 years, or fined not more than $250,000, or both. ‘‘PART C—STATISTICAL EFFICIENCY ‘‘§ 3575. Findings ‘‘The Congress finds the following: ‘‘(1) Federal statistics are an important source of information for public and private decision-makers such as policymakers, con-sumers, businesses, investors, and workers. ‘‘(2) Federal statistical agencies should continuously seek to improve their effi-ciency. Statutory constraints limit the abil-ity of these agencies to share data and thus to achieve higher efficiency for Federal sta-tistical programs. ‘‘(3) The quality of Federal statistics de-pends on the willingness of businesses to re-spond to statistical surveys. Reducing re-porting burdens will increase response rates, and therefore lead to more accurate charac-terizations of the economy. ‘‘(4) Enhanced sharing of business data among the Bureau of the Census, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics for exclusively statistical purposes will improve their ability to track more accurately the large and rapidly chang-ing nature of United States business. In par-ticular, the statistical agencies will be able to better ensure that businesses are consist-ently classified in appropriate industries, re-solve data anomalies, produce statistical samples that are consistently adjusted for the entry and exit of new businesses in a timely manner, and correct faulty reporting errors quickly and efficiently. ‘‘(5) Congress enacted the International In-vestment and Trade in Services Survey Act (Public Law 94–472), which allowed the Bu-reau of the Census, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics to share data on foreign-owned companies. The Act not only expanded detailed industry coverage from 135 industries to over 800 in-dustries with no increase in the data col-lected from respondents but also dem-onstrated how data sharing can result in the creation of valuable data products. ‘‘(6) With part B of this subchapter, the sharing of business data among the Bureau of the Census, the Bureau of Economic Anal-ysis, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics con-tinues to ensure the highest level of con-fidentiality for respondents to statistical surveys. ‘‘§ 3576. Designated statistical agencies ‘‘(a) PURPOSES .—The purposes of this sec-tion are the following: ‘‘(1) To authorize the sharing of business data among the Bureau of the Census, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and the Bu-reau of Labor Statistics for exclusively sta-tistical purposes. ‘‘(2) To reduce the paperwork burdens im-posed on businesses that provide requested information to the Federal Government. ‘‘(3) To improve the comparability and ac-curacy of Federal economic statistics by al-lowing the Bureau of the Census, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics to update sample frames, develop consistent classifications of estab-lishments and companies into industries, im-prove coverage, and reconcile significant dif-ferences in data produced by the three agen-cies. ‘‘(4) To increase understanding of the United States economy, especially for key industry and regional statistics, to develop more accurate measures of the impact of technology on productivity growth, and to enhance the reliability of the Nation’s most important economic indicators, such as the National Income and Product Accounts. ‘‘(b) R

TRIBUTE TO HAZEN MARSHALL Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, ear-lier today, I finished my yearend trib-utes to several of my fellow Senators, but, unfortunately, there is still one more goodbye to a very special member of my own team. It is no exaggeration at all to say that for the past 4 years, Hazen Marshall has stood squarely in the center of every consequential deci-sion and piece of legislation that Con-gress has taken up. Just wrap your mind around the job: the policy direc-tor in the Senate Majority Leader’s of-fice. Every day that Hazen has driven here to the Capitol and parked his big pick-up truck among all the hybrids and hatchbacks, he has come ready to work—as a visionary strategist, a lead negotiator, a graceful manager, a con-stant resource to key players on both sides of the aisle—basically, something like an air traffic controller for the U.S. Senate. Now, with a job like that, it is no wonder that when my chief of staff and I set out to lure Hazen back to the Cap-itol to join our team in 2014, it didn’t start out as an easy sell. For one thing, he had already served 18 years of hard time here. Hazen started out as an intern for his home State Senator, Don Nickles. Now, the way I hear it all these years later, he may or may not have missed the of-ficial deadline for submitting his in-ternship application, but this agri-culture and economics whiz from Okla-homa State was exactly what the office needed, with a farm bill coming up. So they brought him on. By the time he departed the Senate with Don for greener pastures, he had shot up through the ranks and become staff director on the Senate Budget Committee. Everybody knew Hazen, and they knew that he knew every-thing. Everyone loved working with him. He had become a part of this in-stitution in his own right. We knew he would need some good luck to persuade him to write a sequel to all of that, but our fortunes turned around when Hazen volunteered to come down to Kentucky in the last days of my 2014 campaign. With the atmosphere of public serv-ice and the camaraderie and old friend-ships already in place with so many of his would-be colleagues, well, I think

the old bug hit Hazen again right then and right there. I am sure it didn’t hurt when we actually won the majority that year, too. So this policy mastermind and peer-less budget expert came on board. Keep in mind that this is the guy who has only worked for two bosses in his whole life—Don Nickles and his own father. I got to be lucky No. 3. Just a couple of things have hap-pened since then: the early wins, like the 2015 highway bill, paving the way for reconciliation with a quick turn-around on the 2017 budget, getting tax reform off the white board and on to the President’s desk, walking the nar-row bipartisan balance beam of this past winter’s funding agreement, and scoring a win for defense funding. During each of these battles and many others, Hazen was right there at the center of the action. But I can’t think of a single time when he himself sought to be the center of attention. As far as Hazen was concerned, his accom-plishments were not Hazen Marshall’s. They were the accomplishments of the leader’s office, the conference, and the Senate. His victories were all team vic-tories. You couldn’t succeed at a job like Hazen has without having thoroughly mastered the machinery of Congress, but you wouldn’t be as happy doing it or make nearly so many friends along the way, unless you were in it for the right reasons. This is a town where many folks will try to parlay any proximity to power into black-tie invitations and jump at any chance to self-promote—not Hazen. It probably doesn’t hurt that he would probably rather be in the seats at Nat’s Park, anyway, at his kids’ perform-ances, or on the river than at most high-society functions. But even more than that, selfishness is simply not in the man’s character. He is just rock solid, completely con-fident, and utterly reliable. When I or any other Member or any staffer brought a question or problem to Hazen, we knew we would get a straight answer and we would get it fast, and it was guaranteed to be right. In every meeting, on every hard day, there was Hazen at the end of the table reassuring me and everyone else with a smile and his trademark encouraging words: ‘‘It’s all good. It’s all good.’’ He is one of the seniormost staffers in the Senate, still totally humble, still trying to buck everyone up and squeeze some smiles out of the work. And, frankly, with Hazen at the negoti-ating table, it almost always was ‘‘all good.’’ Of course, we will miss more than just Hazen’s professional excellence. His humble, hard-working spirit isn’t the only way he remains less of a belt-way operator and more of that farm boy from Hennessey, OK. He may be one of the most savvy and well-con-nected guys in this city, but you had better believe that while colleagues would compare notes about the dif-ferent trips they had taken over recess, Hazen would grin ear-to-ear while de-scribing the latest Indy car race he had taken in. To be fair, this is also a man of high culture. His affinity for music and the-ater includes the artistic pursuits of his children, Madeline and Max, and practically everything else under the sun as well. So I don’t suspect Hazen will have a hard time filling his days when the Senate reconvenes without him in Jan-uary. Maybe he will dive even deeper into his CrossFit habit and convert to ‘‘two-a-days.’’ Certainly, his devotion to the Wash-ington Nationals will ensure that he still faces many frustrating, stressful situations come springtime, but unlike many legislative challenges, he will be able to shoulder that burden with a cold beer in his hand. I can’t wait to see you in the stands, buddy, but I will miss you here. Thanks so much for your service to me, to your colleagues, and, most of all, to your country. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. T
ILLIS ). The Senator from Oregon.

CLIMATE CHANGE Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to come to the floor with my colleagues from Massachusetts and Delaware to address the grave threat to America and to our planet from car-bon pollution and climate chaos. Over the last 2 weeks, representa-tives from nearly 200 countries have gathered together in Poland to con-tinue the fight against climate chaos. They know that in each and every country we are seeing the impacts across this planet. There are more pow-erful hurricanes, like we have seen here in the United States, more destructive wildfires, like those we see in the Northwest of the United States, record breaking heat waves, air quality dete-rioration, loss of glaciers, loss of global ice, Arctic ice, insect-borne diseases that spread, and coral reefs dying. We are in trouble. The scientists tell us we are now driving the sixth great extinction on planet Earth. It is being driven by human conduct, and a big factor in that is our burning of fossil fuels. We are, in fact, facing the greatest threat humankind has known on the planet. When you begin to damage your own home, you really are in a situation that needs to be immediately ad-dressed. It was back in 1959 that Edward Tell-er, a famed scientist, gave a speech to the 100th anniversary of the petroleum industry. He said: This energy that you have unleashed has done amazing things on the planet. It has given so much ability for humankind to mag-nify their efforts. There was a lot of positive in that, but then the scientist, Edward Teller, went on to say: But there are a couple of challenges here, one of which is that there are only so many fossil fuels in the ground and so, at some point, we will run out. Of course, we know that there are a lot more fossil fuels in the ground now than we knew about in 1959. He said that there is a second prob-lem. When you burn this stuff, it cre-ates an invisible, odorless gas. So it doesn’t really sound like a challenge, but it traps heat. He said that because it traps heat, it will melt the poles, it will raise the oceans, and that will be a problem for humankind because hu-mankind lives along the waterways. He didn’t go into more details than that, but it was one of the first direct commentaries—in 1959—about how the age of fossil fuels was going to produce significant problems for human kind. Now, that speech he gave in 1959. That was 59 years ago, and what have we seen in the ensuing period? We have seen a roughly 100-point increase in carbon pollution on the planet. Or to take my lifetime, for example, in 1956, when I was born, we had about 312 parts per million of carbon. I will just put this chart up. What we see here on the red is the rising line of carbon, going back to roughly when I was born. About in here, 1956 until now, we see that it is accelerating, but es-sentially there is a 100 parts-per-mil-lion increase. We started at about 312 when I was born. We are at about al-most 412 now at the very peak. That is a 30-percent increase in my single life-time, just a little flash of time in terms of the life of this planet—a 32- percent increase in carbon in the at-mosphere, and it is having a significant impact. The most obvious way to look at this impact is the global temperature year after year. So here we see the 10 hot-test years on record. We see that only one of those years, 1998, was before the turn of the century. The rest of them have all been since the turn of the cen-tury. In fact, 17 of the 18 hottest years on record have occurred since the year 2000. Not only that, but look at the dra-matic, dramatic change for 2014, and 2015, and 2016, and 2017—these last four years—and how much hotter the planet is than it was just a few years before. That should trouble all of us. We have seen all of this when global leaders came together in 2015 in Paris— the largest gathering of world leaders in human history. They said we have to put limits on what we are doing. We all have to apply a strategy of each reduc-ing our carbon dioxide production. I would like to say that they have been successful, but they have not. Total global carbon production is still going up and, because of that, we are still in deep trouble. If we didn’t have the information just from these bars of the hottest years on record, we could turn to a more com-plicated analysis, or several of them, that have come out just recently. Just back in October, we had the Intergov-ernmental Panel on Climate Change, bringing the work of scientists across

the planet together, and it painted a very stark picture of where we are right now and how this will only get a lot worse in the years ahead. Or we can turn to the Trump admin-istration’s report that came out the day after Thanksgiving. On Thanks-giving, we give thanks for a lot of things. The day after, the administra-tion informed us that we here on the planet have a big problem. What did they say in that report? Again, this is the Trump administration speaking: ‘‘Earth’s climate is now changing fast-er than at any point in the history of modern civilization, primarily as a re-sult of human activities.’’ Or we could turn to a third report that just came out called the ‘‘Global Carbon Project,’’ and it says that after plateauing for several years, in 2018, global carbon emissions rose 2.7 per-cent. So we are back on an upward tra-jectory. We hit a recordbreaking 37 bil-lion metric tons. How did the United States do? Well, similarly, our carbon emissions here in the United States went up about 2.5 percent. Over the last 2 years, the Trump ad-ministration has tried to do everything it can to make the situation worse. There were rules in place to cut meth-ane leaks because methane is much more of a potent global warming gas than is carbon dioxide. So you never want to let it out of the pipe. But they worked to weaken those rules. They worked to weaken vehicle emission standards so we get more pollution for each mile, rather than less pollution. I did find one thing of interest; that is, when Judith Garber, the Deputy As-sistant Secretary of State for Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs, went over to Poland to give a report for the United States. She bragged about our carbon capture utilization and storage technology, and how one powerplant in Texas is cap-turing more than 90 percent of the emissions from its blue gas stream. So she was holding this up as a vision of what the United States is doing to con-tribute to the technology in the world and to help things be better. What she didn’t say is, the previous week, on December 6, the Trump ad-ministration issued a draft rule ex-empting new powerplants from carbon capture. That would have been a much more complete story about the record of this administration. Of the 20 nations represented at the recent G20 summit in Argentina, only the United States refused to sign a nonbinding statement saying countries were committed to fighting climate chaos. All we had to do is say, yes, we are aware it is a problem, and we are committed to fighting it, but the United States turned that down. Over in Poland, we joined with Russia and Saudi Arabia and Kuwait—three oil- rich nations—to weaken a statement recognizing the international report about the challenges we face. We need global leadership. Without our help, countries still came together in Poland to write a rule book to try to go forward without the involvement and leadership of the United States. They worked very hard on that rule book, and it addressed things like transparency and accountability; it ad-dressed issues related to carbon cred-its; it addressed issues that were de-signed to develop a strategy for tech-nical experts and exactly how you count carbon in your country. It wasn’t a perfect rule book, but we now have one, and we can make improvements on it in the future. Think about how much faster we would go forward in tackling this prob-lem if we had American leadership. We need this leadership. The world needs this leadership to tackle climate chaos. It is not something you can do just as good a job 10 years or 20 years from now as you can now because you can’t get this carbon out of the atmosphere easily once it is in there. It stays for hundreds of years. It keeps adding to the trapping of heat for hundreds of years. We need to act now. We are facing the big challenge of feedback loops. What do I mean? Up in the Arctic, when you have less ice, you have blue ocean, the sunshine goes into the water, and it heats it up more than if it were reflecting off ice. So it gets warmer and warmer and warmer. How about this? Just a couple weeks ago, a picture was published of a lake in Alaska that was boiling—not with heat, but with methane; methane bub-bling up out of the permafrost under-neath the lake at such a rapid pace, it was a heavy boiling motion on the top of the water. That is a feedback loop that should scare us all because of the enormous heat-trapping properties of methane. All across the planet, as it gets warmer, permafrost and heat start off-gassing this methane. So there we are. We have to move fast. We need American leadership to be fully engaged in the vision of Mis-sion 100, going to 100 percent clean and renewable energy in the fastest pos-sible time. We have to quit subsidizing fossil fuels and start subsidizing renew-able energy or at least put them on a level playing field with each other. We need a green new deal to completely re-build our energy economy in the United States of America and create all kinds of jobs—all kinds of working American jobs: sheet metal jobs, elec-trician jobs, pipefitting jobs, jobs of every kind—as we rework the energy economy to build that vision of 100 per-cent renewable energy. Think how many jobs you would create if you just proceeded to renovate your house. Now think of the tens of millions of jobs if you renovate the entire energy econ-omy of the United States of America. We need American leadership to work in partnership with other nations so every nation holds each other account-able to this vision of transitioning to renewable energy. We need American leadership to say to Germany: Yes, you have done some things very well on solar, but why are you building a Nord Stream 2 pipeline to bring massive amounts of natural gas from Russia for the next-genera-tion dependence on fossil fuel? We need to say to Japan: You are putting your entire energy economy onto liquid natural gas. How can you meet your Paris obligations? How can you be a partner with the rest of the world if you are not willing to pursue renewable energy? We need leadership in America that says to Australia: You are doubling down on coal while your outback is burning in the middle of your winter, and your Great Barrier Reef is half dead over the last couple of years from water that is too warm and too acidic due to climate chaos. We need American leadership to tell China: Yes, you are investing in renew-able energy at home. Great. Speed it up, but why are you financing 200 coal- powered plants around the world? That is not acceptable. Shut that down. We have to have American leader-ship. This is not a question between economic development and the envi-ronment. Quite the contrary. In this case, renovating our energy economy creates a strong environment. It allows us to go to the cheapest form of energy on the planet, solar and wind. Why is it the cheapest? Because there is no fuel. The fuel for solar is the Sun. We don’t have to pay for that. The fuel for wind are the breezes that blow. We don’t have to pay for that. In fact, just a few months ago Xcel Energy did a re-quest for proposals for new electric generating capacity, and it came out at 2 cents per kilowatt hour for solar and 3 cents for wind. That is less than burn-ing coal in an existing fossil fuel plant. If you believe nothing about the dam-age to our planet because it is just too terrifying, and you don’t want to hear that bad news, then at least turn to the economic opportunity of taking Amer-ica forward to the cheapest, cleanest energy we can possibly have. Wells Griffith, the administration’s top adviser cop, said: ‘‘We strongly be-lieve that no country should have to sacrifice economic prosperity or energy security in pursuit of environmental sustainability.’’ That is the big lie. That is the big Koch brothers lie to the planet; that somehow we must sacrifice our economy in order to pursue cleaner energy, when in fact the opposite is true. American leadership has helped take the world forward in all kinds of tech-nology. Some of those famous moments was our leadership in splitting the atom and creating atomic energy, put-ting a man on the Moon, creating the internet, taking on significant dis-eases, and leading the world in wiping them out—diseases like polio. We need that kind of leadership today, leader-ship to work in partnership with the world to save our planet. I yield to my colleague from Florida. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Florida.

rapt attention at the excellence of their presentations and the depth of their understanding of this problem. I couldn’t help but notice on the charts of the Senator from Oregon, often the source was NOAA or NASA, two Agencies where we have had to worry, in the last 2 years, about the at-tempted muzzling of science, of sci-entists, and the seeming putdown of science—not by the Agencies them-selves because they are such great ex-perts. As matter of fact, when I have held several hearings at ground zero, which is South Florida, where we are seeing the effects of climate change in the rising of the seas and now are see-ing a mean high tide and the water sloshing over the curbs of South Flor-ida cities—having these hearings there, it is often NASA scientists and NOAA scientists who testify. So I want the Senator from Oregon, the Senator from Delaware who pre-ceded him, several others, and the Sen-ator from Massachusetts to know how much I appreciate their taking up the banner and keeping on this matter. I also want to say that if we do not change our processes of putting a lot of carbon into the air—and, as the Sen-ator said, it is often methane, it is often carbon dioxide—the Earth will continue to heat up. If it gets heated up to something over 4 degrees Fahr-enheit more than the average annual global temperature, that is the point of no return. At that point, you can’t stop the heating up. If we know the disaster now that we see in the sea level rising, the greater cost to government with the additional infrastructure, the moving of water wells further inland to keep away from the encroaching sea water and salt-water intrusion—if we know that, why in the world would we not contemplate the ultimate destruction of the planet if it gets too hot? I would love to get the Senator’s comments. Mr. MERKLEY. I appreciate so much the comments of my colleague from Florida. I had the chance to go down to Flor-ida at the end of October at a rally to address the challenge of red tide, algae that was growing in the ocean that pro-duces a toxin. The toxin is so powerful that it was causing a lot of respiratory problems for people who live along the gulf coast, and it was killing a lot of animals. People were talking about manatees, dolphins, turtles, and fish washing up on the beach. Not only did they have the toxins from the red algae, but they had the stench from the dying sea life. The sense of people who gathered to talk about this was that dramatic ac-tion is needed; that this was com-pletely compromising the quality of life, the health of the oceans, and the ability to harvest food out of the ocean. People were saying they were actually taking inland vacations; that is, leaving the coast until the air would get better. They said that, unfortu-nately, the circumstances had been in that bad condition for 10 months of the last 12 months—meaning they might not actually want to go back, at least not keep a home there. I thought of the parallel from your State in Florida to my State in Oregon because we have an area in Southern Oregon that has been deeply afflicted by fire smoke the last two summers. The smoke has tainted furniture being sold. It has shut down outdoor events. It has stopped people from hiking the Cascade Trail. It is affecting the econ-omy. House prices are changing. People are thinking twice about booking for— there is a different set of economic im-pacts. These are only the indirect im-pacts. There is the direct impact on the Panhandle of Florida. I just saw the pictures of complete devastation when the hurricane came across earlier this year. Of course, we saw the pictures of complete devastation for some of the communities that the forest fires on the West Coast burned to a crisp. So our two States and our citizens know there is a problem. Not everyone wants to face the underlying cause of methane and carbon pollution driving it, but everybody knows there is a problem. We are fortunate to have your sci-entists—your NOAA scientists, your NASA scientists—and all the satellite information they are feeding us so we can study it and stand on the floor of the Senate and say: We do know the cause, and it is our responsibility as leaders of this Nation, leaders in the Senate, to proceed to make sure we act aggressively in partnership with the world. I just want to say I thank you so much for your service in this Chamber and your knowledge about the sci-entific facts and willingness to never look away from them and to confront what those facts mean for the policies we need to adopt. Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I will conclude my remarks by just bringing you back to the vision that I had in the window of a spacecraft orbiting the Earth every 90 minutes. An hour of that was in the daylight of the sun and about a half-hour of that in the shadow of the Earth, which is the nighttime, looking at how beautiful the Earth was, and yet it looked so fragile. You could look at the rim of the Earth, that bright blue band, but right under-neath it you could see that very thin atmosphere that supports all of our life. With the naked eye, from that al-titude in the spacecraft orbiting the planet, you could actually see how we are messing it up. You could see this in flight 34 years ago. As a matter of fact, our first launch attempt, 34 years today, took us five tries to get off the ground, but once we did, we could see with the naked eye how we are messing it up. Coming across Madagascar, the island nation off the southeast coast of the continent of Africa, you could see they had cut down all the trees. You could immediately see the effects because when the rains came, there was no vegetation to hold the topsoil, and the topsoil was all running down. From that altitude, looking down, you could see that silt going out into the bright blue waters of the Indian Ocean. With the naked eye, you can see that. It is such a beautiful planet. We best take care of it. Indeed, that was the effect upon me of having gone into space. I decided I wanted to be a better steward when I came back to Earth. Here we are, 34 years later, still fighting—fighting and fighting—to try to get people to under-stand what we are doing to ourselves. I thank this Senator, and I thank all the Senators who have spoken here, and I want your voices to keep strong and keep consistent and keep at it because sooner or later—hopefully, not after a catastrophe—the world’s population is going to come around and understand that we have to be better stewards of our home. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Florida.

U.S. TROOP WITHDRAWAL FROM SYRIA Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, earlier today, this morning, the administra-tion announced the intent to remove all American troops—not a large pres-ence, but all Americans troops—from Syria. I want to be clear, as I have been all day about this, that I believe it is a catastrophic mistake that will have grave consequences for the United States, for our interests, and our allies in the months and years to come. I want to take a moment to come here and explain why. The rationale behind the decision we were given today by the administration is that there is no longer a need for U.S. presence in Syria because ISIS has been defeated. Just a week ago, the President’s own envoy to the global co-alition on ISIS said this, and I want to quote from the statement that he gave last week to the press. He said: 
[T]he end of ISIS will be a much more long-term initiative. Nobody is declaring a mission accomplished. We know that once the physical space is defeated we can’t just pick up and leave. 
This was a quote from the Presi-dent’s own envoy to the global coali-tion on ISIS—not 6 months ago, 6 days ago. We don’t have time here or I could take up all the time of the Senate to outline statement after statement from military and diplomatic officials in the administration basically echoing the same point. The point that we are making is this. ISIS still controls territory, particu-larly, in the Euphrates River valley of Syria. From the territory they still control, they generate money, they control the population, and they produce propaganda videos. Even if that is taken away, ISIS is on its way to turning into an insurgency—mean-ing, no longer an organization that

controls vast spaces of land or has a capital city—an insurgency like we saw in Iraq, an insurgency like what al- Qaida operated like and continues to operate like. Insurgencies in many ways are even harder to defeat because they don’t wave a flag and tell you where they are, because they meld into the population by day and then wreak havoc and suffering by night. I am not here to deny there hasn’t been true progress made against ISIS. There absolutely has. If you look at what ISIS had, what ISIS controlled when this administration began and where they are today, this has been a substantial achievement, but we have to finish the job. The job is not fin-ished. Why has ISIS’s presence in Syria been degraded? It is because the United States, with a very limited military presence—we are not talking Afghani-stan here with tens of thousands of troops. We are not talking Iraq here with a massive surge. We are talking about a very capable but light foot-print of American primarily trainers and people there to assist, although they most certainly can fight and have done so in the past. Working alongside a ground force made up of the Syrian Democratic Forces—primarily Arabs—and the Kurdish forces from the YPG, who are highly capable fighters from the Kurds, they have been on the ground fighting with our assistance and our direction and sometimes our direct involvement against ISIS in the Euphrates River valley. They are the reason why in that part of Syria ISIS’s control has rapidly degraded. They are the reason, but they are the ones fighting. That has been a difficult thing to achieve be-cause the No. 1 objective of the Kurds is to protect Kurdish cities and towns in northern Syria. There is a longstanding dispute be-tween the Kurds and Turkey. There is a Kurdish organization in Turkey, and then there is one affiliated with them housed in northern Syria and in cities that are Kurdish cities. Their No. 1 pri-ority is maintaining their cities. That is what they care about the most. Get-ting them to actually take time out from that interest and confront ISIS was not easy. It has been an enormous achievement to partner and colocate with them in fighting and in degrading ISIS in that area. As I said, it has not been easy be-cause ISIS is not their top priority. Their No. 1 priority is maintaining control of the Kurdish towns and cities in northern Syria and, more impor-tantly, preventing Turkey and the Turkish military from taking it from them. They have been threatening to pull out of this ISIS effort for a long time, most recently when Erdogan went around saying: I am on the verge. I am going to invade. I am coming in. Any day now I am going after the Kurds in Syria. We already knew that if that hap-pened, many of these YPG forces—the Kurds—would abandon the fight on ISIS and immediately be pulled into defending the Kurdish cities. Now that are we are pulling out, now that we are retreating, now that we are abandoning this effort, I can guarantee you that the Kurdish forces are going to leave. They are going back to the Kurdish areas to prepare to confront the Turk-ish military activity that they have announced and that could be coming at any moment. You know what that means? That means that there will no longer be anyone on the ground in the Euphrates River valley attacking ISIS. Let me tell you what comes next. Now the pressure is off from ISIS. Now they can really regroup. This is going to give them an enormous propaganda victory. As they take more and more territory, they are going to brag about it. That is going to help them recruit new fighters and resurrect themselves. It is going to give them more territory. It is going to give them access to more money. All of that is going to allow them to expand their insurgency plan. They are going to have more people, more money, and more territory to do it from because, again, the Kurds are going to leave. Now that we are leav-ing, they are leaving, and no one will be fighting ISIS on the ground in the Euphrates River valley. In fact, ISIS might even be able to restart its specialized military training in that area. We are allowing ISIS to come back. Before long, we are all going to be talking about ISIS again— producing videos, kidnapping people, beheading people, taking territory, ter-rorizing people, and doing it as an in-surgency, which is even harder to fight, as I said earlier. Why is that happening? Who are the winners of all this? Let me tell you, I think the one winner here has been Erdogan. He has absolutely played us on this. It is truly stunning. He has spent months pressuring the United States to abandon the Kurds—dip-lomatically and in phone calls to the President and to others. He has spent months doing that. He has been put-ting pressure on the one side while also threatening military action on the other, in essence, saying: I am coming into Syria—the Turks—and I am going after the YPG—the Kurds—and I know U.S. troops are embedded alongside them, and you should be careful be-cause we are coming in. He has been doing this for months. The goal of it the whole time was to separate the United States from the Kurds, to get us to break up this ar-rangement that we had with them to fight ISIS, and it worked. He has achieved it. It is truly unbelievable that he has been able to get us to back down. I want everyone to think about this additional complication. Turkey is a member of NATO. Article 5 of NATO says that if a NATO member is at-tacked, you all have to come to their defense and it is attack on all of us. While there is some wiggle room about what the appropriate response should be, the bottom line is that the Turks have in the past threatened to invoke article 5. Think about this for a moment. Think about for a moment if after being attacked, the Kurds—both in Turkey and in Syria—decide to attack back, as they will to defend them-selves. Turkey is going to say: We are under attack from Kurdish forces and the YPG. We invoke article 5. I want you to think for a moment about what position that puts the United States in. We have a choice. We can stand behind our article 5 commit-ment to NATO, but if we do so, we are going to have to help the Turks de-feat—meaning kill—the very people who we were just colocated with today and yesterday and for months. The very people we have been working with to defeat ISIS for over 2
1⁄2years are now people that, if we allow article 5 to be invoked by Turkey, we are going to have to join in trying to defeat them— meaning kill. The other alternative is to not re-spect article 5 and not come to their defense, and then you have placed the entire NATO alliance in doubt because it will have been invoked for the sec-ond time in its history, and the United States didn’t respond to it. We lose ei-ther way. We either help them kill the Kurds, our partners, as recently as today, or we ignore article 5. That sounds pretty dramatic, and there is some wiggle room as to what the ap-propriate response would be. Let there be no doubt, Erdogan is the kind of geopolitical hardball player to trigger this sort of response, and he has threatened to do it in the past—truly, unbelievable. Who is the other big winner? Russia. In fact, their embassy in the United States already put out a tweet cele-brating the decision. Why? First of all, because America is now out. At some point, people are going to have to sit down and decide what is the future of a post-ISIS Syria. You know who will be at that table? The Turks will be at that table because they are going to have a military presence in northern Syria. The Iranians are going to be at the table because they are the closest al-lies Assad has. Assad will be at the table, and Putin will be at the table. Guess who will not be at the table? The United States of America. Vladimir Putin, of course, is celebrating this de-cision because America basically walked away and gave up its seat at the table. We have no presence there any longer, and we have turned over this country and its future and its meaning in the region to Vladimir Putin and Iran and Assad. Also, another reason why Putin is a big winner is because you can just imagine those meetings now when Putin goes to the Middle East and meets with the Egyptians and the Saudis and the Jordanians, and, frank-ly, even the Israelis. You know what he

will say to them? He will say to them: I don’t know why you are counting on America. I don’t know why you are re-lying on America. They are unreliable. Vladimir Putin will say: Look at me. I stood by Assad. Even after the whole world came after him, I stood by him. I didn’t retreat. Look at America. They abandoned these Kurds to be slaugh-tered by the Turks and maybe by the regime, and you are going to put the future and the security of your country in the hands of an unreliable and er-ratic partner like the United States? It is a huge victory for Putin in that regard. By the way, put yourself in the posi-tion of the Kurds facing an onslaught from the Turkish military. You have now given them two choices. They can partner up with Rus-sia as their protector against Turkey or they can partner up with the regime in Iran. That is the choice we have left them with. The other big winners in all this are Iran and Hezbollah. For a long time, Assad has allowed Iran to use Syria as a transit point to arm Hezbollah in Lebanon so Lebanon can threaten and attack Israel. They will now be able to step up those ef-forts. There is no U.S. presence in Syria. There is no U.S. seat at the table, and you can fully expect that Iran is going to step up their engagement in Syria with Hezbollah. Let me tell you why that is a prob-lem. I will get to that in a moment. It has to do with Israel, but here is the bottom line. You can fully expect now that Iran is going to step up its own presence through the IRGC and through Hezbollah and through the mi-litias they have empowered in the re-gion right on the border with Israel. Iran now has the ability to put weap-onry and killers right across the Golan Heights, right on the border with Israel. The other big winner in all of this, of course, is Hezbollah. As I said, they now have expanded their area and their supply route. So I would be remiss if I didn’t men-tion that with all this talk of ISIS, there is still an al-Qaida presence in Syria. They were called Nusra Front. Now it is Hurras al-Deen. They can change their name all they want, it is al-Qaida. They have operatives in Syria, and al-Qaida spends a lot of time planning external operations. We thank our men and women in Home-land Security, in the military, in our security systems and intelligence sys-tems for protecting us, but al-Qaida spends all day long plotting and think-ing about how to strike the United States around the world and here in the homeland, and the lack of a U.S. presence in Syria means that the Syr-ian branch of al-Qaida, Hurrus al-Deen, now has the ability to operate in a space that is even more desirable than what they have today. The last winner in all this is sur-prising because you may ask: What does it have to do with Syria? It is China. You can just imagine the meet-ings now that China is going to be hav-ing throughout Asia. You have all these countries in Asia which see this sort of growing conflict between the United States and China, and they are trying to figure out how do we stay out of this fight, but if we are forced to pick, which side do we pick? They pre-fer us. We are more reliable. We are more capable. We believe in democracy and human rights and respecting them and that sort of thing, but China in those meetings is going to say: Amer-ica is a power in decline. America is unreliable. America is erratic. The same argument that Putin is going to use in the Middle East and in Europe is the argument China is going to use against us all over the world and par-ticularly in the Asia-Pacific region. Those are the implications of these kinds of decisions. They will increas-ingly go to places like Japan and South Korea and others and say: You know, do you really want to put all your eggs in the American basket because they are an unreliable ally. Look at what they did to the Kurds in Syria. Now, of course, there are losers, and obviously Israel, in this part, is one of them. The statement from the Prime Minister of Israel is pretty telling. He said: It is an American decision. We are not going to interfere with it, but we are going to do whatever it takes to protect our interests in this area. Translation? They are going to step up their attacks. They are already con-ducting strikes inside Syria. Every time they see a dangerous rocket sys-tem moving toward Hezbollah, anytime something that looks like it could threaten Israel from Syria pops up, they go in there, and they blow it up. They are going to have to step up those efforts now because as those ef-forts increase, they are going to have to get more aggressive, and eventually they are going to kill Iranians. They are going to kill a lot of people in Hezbollah, but they are going to kill Iranians, and the Iranians are going to respond. Hezbollah is going to respond, and they are probably eventually going to respond by launching a vast volume of rockets coming over from Lebanon, and Israel is going to have to respond to that. Suddenly, we have the next Israel- Hezbollah war, except this one is going to be much deadlier than the one 10 years ago because now Hezbollah has more rockets, better rockets that have longer range and precision in their guidance. So even if Israel has this in-credible defense system, it can be over-whelmed by volume. It is such a small country. What do you think is going to happen when population centers in Israel cannot be protected from these attacks? Israel is going to respond, as they always have had to do in their self-defense, with disproportionate force, and we are going to have an all- out war potentially between Israel versus Iran and Hezbollah, and who knows where that leads. I assure you, the United States is going to be called upon to help in that regard, at a minimum, by supplying Israel and maybe more. Who else could that pull in? This is not a game. There are serious repercussions if you think forward about what could happen next and how quickly this could destabilize the region and how quickly the pullout of a small American presence could lead to a much larger one down the road. Ultimately, Israel is an enormous loser here because by the United States retreating, we have given the green light for Iran to expand its presence right on their border. This is the clos-est—other than Lebanon and Hezbollah—this is now the closest Iran has ever been to Israeli territory, just across the Golan Heights. So think about it for a moment. You are Israel. You have problems in Judea and Samaria with the Palestinian Au-thority, you have issues in Gaza, you have Hezbollah in Lebanon, and now you have Iran with a growing presence just north of you in Syria. You are en-circled. This is the predicament this helps creates. By far, the biggest loser in this en-deavor is the United States of America. We have surrendered our influence in the outcome of this conflict in Syria. At some point, nations are going to sit down and figure out what Syria looks like moving forward, and we will have zero role to play in it. It will be decided by the Turks and the Russians and pri-marily the Iranians and Assad, and we will have no role to play in it. We have also undermined other na-tions’ trust in the reliability of the American alliance, and the implica-tions of that are extraordinary. If you think about the world today and na-tions like Japan and South Korea and Saudi Arabia and Egypt, these are countries that either can immediately or may in the future decide they need nuclear weapons to protect themselves: South Korea from North Korea, Japan from China, Saudi Arabia from Iran, Egypt from Iran. The reason many of these countries have been willing not to develop nuclear weapons is because the United States has, in the case of South Korea and Japan, directly as-sured their security, and that has kept the peace. What happens when more and more nations develop weapons of mass de-struction the way India and Pakistan have—about each other. Well, you have more weapons of mass destruction, and then it creates the possibility of mis-calculation or, even worse, that a gov-ernment—for example, in Saudi Arabia or in Egypt—is overthrown and some radical regime takes hold and they have nuclear weapons or they pro-liferate and sell it to people and that is used. This is far-fetched for some people. This is reality. This is how foreign pol-icy should be made, not just thinking about what is in front of you today but what could happen and the chain of

events that could be triggered by a de-cision. This is not a game. This is seri-ous stuff. On top of all that, losing the trust of our allies and nations around the world, losing our influence in a solu-tion in Syria—ISIS is going to re-emerge. It is not going to be the same ISIS it was before, controlling vast amounts of territory, but I will tell you what, al-Qaida never controlled vast amounts of territory. Operating from caves and hideouts throughout the Middle East, they carried out 9/11 and other threats against the United States and the homeland that were thwarted. ISIS is going to reemerge now. They are once again going to be able to re-cruit people. They are going to have an insurgency that is going to be able to strike and perhaps externally plot. They are going to be able, from that presence they have in Syria, to influ-ence their affiliates everywhere from the Philippines to Central Africa, to other countries in the region. That is why I am here to tell you this is a catastrophic decision. Forget, for a moment, about no one being notified; it was just announced at the last minute. I haven’t heard a single mem-ber of the administration—not one, not the Secretary of Defense, not the Sec-retary of State—who is going to own this decision? Who is willing to step forward and tell the American people or Congress, here is why we are making this decision, and here is the strategy it is in furtherance of? Someone ex-plain that. It is important. The Amer-ican people deserve to know. I haven’t heard that today. We haven’t heard it before. We thought we had the outlines of some strategy here. All that has been taken away. Why are we doing this? What is the rationale and what comes next? What is the plan to keep ISIS from reemerging? What is the plan to keep Iran from growing its presence in Southern Syria and threatening Israel? What is the plan to deal with the al- Qaida element that already exists there? What is our role? What role are we going to play in a post-ISIS and post-al-Qaida Syria—and particularly as it relates to whether it can be used as a base of operations against our in-terests and our men and women in uni-form stationed in the region. None of that has been outlined. Is anyone in the administration going to own this and explain it? Be-cause so far we haven’t heard it, and this is an important public policy deci-sion. I hope I am wrong about all this. I hope this all works out, but it is not going to, and I am telling you, these are the kinds of decisions that define Presidencies. These are the kinds of mistakes that end up haunting a na-tion for years and years and years thereafter. It is the hard lesson of Iraq. It is the hard lesson of decisions made at other times in our history. I hope this can be reversed. I hope this can be reexamined because I honestly believe—put politics aside—I honestly believe this is a cata-strophic decision for America’s na-tional security interests. If this stands, we in this Congress and we as a nation are going to be dealing with the con-sequences of it for years to come. We will remember this day as the day that started it all. We will remember this day as a major blunder, in which by ignoring the advice of every diplo-matic and military official who has spoken about this publicly for the last 2 years, we made a decision, for reasons that have not yet been explained, that triggered—that triggered—a series of events that no one foresaw at the time but proved to be much more dangerous and much costlier than anything we are doing there now. So I honestly and sincerely hope someone in the administration is lis-tening and that there is a chance to re-verse or amend this decision before it is too late. I yield the floor.

LIVER TRANSPLANT POLICY Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I am here to speak tonight because some-thing is not right. I want to express my real concern with the recent decision of the national liver allocation policy made by the Organ Procurement Transplant Network made on Decem-ber 4. This sounds like something that is far away and perhaps of no real con-sequence, but the decision that was made has huge consequences on every American and should be receiving more attention than it has to date because the number of organs that are avail-able for transplant and where those or-gans will be available is being deter-mined by this small group of people. The decision they made throws aside expert advice from transplant surgeons and hospitals on best practices. It also carries the risk of decreasing organ do-nation rates, as donors learn their or-gans will not be used in their own com-munities but will be shipped someplace in the country. Places in the country today have donor programs designed to encourage donors to donate their or-gans, and part of that is the under-standing that those organs are going to be available for your family, your friends and neighbors, and people with-in your community. This decision limits the availability and access to donated organs in areas that currently have low wait times and damages the ability of our major trans-plant hospitals to perform these serv-ices for patients. In December of 2017, following two rounds of public com-ment period and extensive deliberation by the OPTN board, that board ap-proved a compromise allocation policy that served the transplant commu-nity’s best interests. This served as a policy reform that was worked out over years to better benefit the entire coun-try based upon compromise by trans-plant experts, patients, and stake-holders. However, the next year in 2018, a law-suit was filed based upon the HRSA al-location policies, and in the face of that single voice of criticism, they dis-regarded years of work and com-promise that was reached the year be-fore. It is unfortunate that the basis for this policy change was litigation, not a determination of how best to im-prove the Nation’s organ transplant, procurement, and allocation process. HRSA has rushed to respond to this lawsuit by abdicating their duty to im-plement good policy, instead allowing a single case to divert liver allocation policy across the entire United States. In October, I had a meeting with Dr. George Sigounas, the Administrator of HRSA. He described to me the impor-tance of the comment period on these policies and how seriously his Agency would take them, especially consid-ering that they were the very institu-tions and doctors who would go on to perform these transplants. Shortly thereafter, I was dis-appointed to learn these comments were not comments made by the pub-lic, by these institutions, the doctors who perform transplants—that these comments were not even considered by the individuals tasked with crafting and advising the latest policy. In fact, Sue Dunn, the president of OPTN, has informed a number of commenters in the transplant community that their concerns over new policy were not even read by the board that approved the new policy. The reason these comments were not considered was due to the fact that OPTN’s comment system was so overloaded in the days leading up to the decision that it caused a complete shutdown of that process. So many transplant hospitals, sur-geons, and medical professionals had deep enough concerns that they took the time out of their day to express them. These are the people tasked with saving lives through transplants each and every day. Yet their opinions, in essence, were deemed invalid. So many comments were submitted that the en-tire system shut down, and OPTN’s re-sponse was simply to ignore them. Further, OPTN did not choose to re-consider their damaging policies in the face of widespread opposition from the medical community. OPTN continues to push forward against all common sense in their pursuit to radically alter the way organs are distributed across the United States. Decisions on na-tional organ allocation should be grounded in expert opinions rather than in a response to a single lawsuit. HRSA and OPTN are making a grave mistake in pushing this damaging pol-icy that carries a significant cost— human lives. In the meeting I had with Dr. Sigounas, as I indicated, he told me these comments should not just be comments but present actual sugges-tions of what the policy should be. I

know of institutions and organizations that did that, and to learn they were disregarded causes me to have great concerns. The Senator from Missouri, Mr. B
LUNT , and I have probed Secretary Azar, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, on this subject, and we are eagerly awaiting his justifica-tion for what appears to be a major sig-nificant error. It appears that HRSA and OPTN making policy in such a reckless fashion has become the nor-mal state of affairs. Additional over-sight may be necessary to ensure that fairness in organ allocation policy is protected and some common sense pre-vails in future policy. I know there is a group of Senators who are working on legislation to do just that. I am very disappointed in the actions of HRSA, OPTN, and UNOS. This proc-ess has been flawed from start to fin-ish, guided not by what is best for the country but how to sidestep a single lawsuit. Organ procurement and allocation policy is too important. It is about life and death and is too important to be simply decided by lawsuits and countersuits, which I fear now will be-come the way of addressing this issue. I will continue to work to protect our hospitals, our doctors, and particularly our patients—Americans—from this policy that disregarded all input from those in the transplant community. This discussion cannot be seen as any-thing coming to a close. It is far from over. I remain committed to finding answers, changing the tide, and putting patients and providers first in these life-or-death scenarios. I thank you. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Ohio.

TRIBUTE TO MARCIA FUDGE Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, 10 years ago this summer, we lost a longtime friend of mine and colleague, a remark-able public servant, Congresswoman Stephanie Tubbs Jones. When M
ARCIA FUDGE , then the mayor of Warrensville Heights, a Cleveland suburb, won the special election to Stephanie’s seat to represent the 11th Congressional District, including Cleveland and the home where Connie and I live, she had big shoes to fill, but M
ARCIA rose to the occasion. For the past decade, she has been a fighter for my hometown of Cleveland and the east side suburbs into Akron and all the Ohioans she serves. On the Education and Workforce Committee, she has become a senior leader who knows how to get things done. She stands up for Ohio’s teach-ers, students, and families. M
ARCIA also joined the Agriculture Committee, perhaps not initially seen as a natural fit for someone with an urban district like hers, but she under-stands that farm bills are not just about crops. They are food bills, eco-nomic development bills, conservation bills, research bills, and nutrition bills. She and I—and I am the first Senator in half a century to be on the Ag Com-mittee for some of the same reasons Congressman FUDGE is on this com-mittee. We have worked together to write two farm bills. This year, we both served on the bill’s conference committee, and we fought House Republican efforts to erect more bureaucracy to gut nutri-tion programs in Ohio that families rely on. These are programs for people making $8, $10, $12 an hour who don’t have quite enough income to feed their families. We won that fight. Tomorrow the President is scheduled to sign the bipartisan farm bill we passed with overwhelming bipartisan support in both Houses. Congress-woman F
UDGE and I worked to right a century-old wrong and get Central State University the 1890 land grant status they deserve. That designation isn’t just a rhetorical honor; it means more opportunities for funding and re-search in partnerships with industry— the sort of results that Marcia delivers for her district. She is a leader among her colleagues. As head of the Congressional Black Caucus, she led the fight on so many issues, including working to ensure that all Americans have a voice in their government. A few years ago, we held a field hear-ing on barriers too many Ohioans face exercising their most fundamental right—the right to vote. M
ARCIA was a star in that hearing. It came in the wake of a despicable Ohio law and, frankly, years of attempts at voter suppression by Ohio Republicans—a despicable Ohio law that cut the num-ber of early voting days in half. We know exactly whom these laws are aimed at. M
ARCIA testified about how these suppression tactics hurt communities of color. Unfortunately, it has gotten worse—limiting absentee balloting, restricting provisional bal-loting—and the Supreme Court, a Court that puts its thumb on the scale of justice in support of corporations over workers, a Court that puts its thumb on the scale of justice to sup-port Wall Street over consumers, and a Court that rubberstamps all these re-strictions on voting. I look forward to continuing our fight alongside M
ARCIA against these tactics straight out of the Jim Crow era. I know M
ARCIA will continue to be a leader. There is no doubt, even before her election to Congress, that M
ARCIA  was a force to be reckoned with: a former mayor, a former congressional chief of staff, and former national president—as important as anything she has done, I think in her mind—of Delta Sigma Theta. She still helps lead efforts to bring Deltas from around the country to the Hill each year for Delta Days. Hundreds of driven, ambitious, smart, committed, empathetic talented Black women come to our Nation’s Capitol to meet with Members of Con-gress and make their voices heard. They have an incredible role model in MARCIA FUDGE . I am grateful, Congresswoman F
UDGE , to have you as my Congress-woman. I am proud to call you a col-league and a friend.

ECONOMY Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I noticed today news reports from Bloomberg that the year 2017 is shaping up to be or likely was the most profitable year in Wall Street history. So what is Congress’s reaction to that? What hap-pens in the majority leader’s office? More special interest legislation, more breaks for Wall Street, more tax cuts. So this Congress—this Congress has de-cided that Wall Street never quite has enough; that the richest people in this country are never rich enough; that the most powerful people in this coun-try are not powerful enough. So what happens down the hall in the majority leader’s office? What happens way down the hall in the Speaker’s of-fice, although voters this year decided this year to eject him and his staff and his cohorts and his fellow travelers—if I can use a phrase like that—from that office and elect a whole different group of people. What they have done is meet behind closed doors to help the oil companies, the drug companies, the gun lobby, and help especially Wall Street. In fact, not only are there all kinds of Wall Street lobbyists day in and day out—tobacco lobbyists, gun lobbyists, and others, but the White House itself looks like a retreat for Wall Street executives. We know that. That is why, I guess, Wall Street had such a great year in 2017.

TRIBUTE TO PAT ROGALA Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I want to honor the career of Patricia Rogala, who has been with my office our entire 12 years in the Senate and my 14 years in the House before that. Pat is the model of a dedicated public servant. After more than 25 years serving the people of Ohio, Pat is retiring at the end of the year. Her first day on the job in Cleveland, Congress was in the middle of a fight— sounds familiar—over healthcare. Some local activists sent an Elvis im-personator to the office singing a healthcare song to the tune of ‘‘It’s Now or Never.’’ Pat said at the time, ‘‘What am I getting myself into?’’ Fortunately, she stayed. As our Ohio scheduler, she has sent me all over my State. She has helped me put more road miles on our made-in-Toledo Jeep Cherokee than any travel agent ever could. She has made sure I am able to serve Ohioans through meetings and roundtables and plant visits. She juggles a Senate schedule that changes—as we see tonight—always at the last minute. She ensures that this

office serves every corner of Ohio. She works directly in concert and coordina-tion with Diana Baron in our Wash-ington office. It is a tough job, but Pat makes it look easy. One of our colleagues in our office wrote this week that Pat has been a true friend and wonderful coworker. What a loss we will feel come Monday when she is not sitting in her office hard at work. It is a loss to all of us. We will miss you, Pat. You have had an incredible impact on your col-leagues. You made such a difference serving Ohio for the people of Ohio, but after a quarter of a century, you have earned a long and happy retirement. Your family needs you, and your fam-ily loves you so. Thank you, Pat. (Mr. RUBIO assumed the Chair.)

TRIBUTE TO MARGARET MOLNAR Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise to honor the career of Margaret Molnar, a dedicated public servant who has made a difference in the lives of thousands of Ohioans and who is retiring soon after 12 years with my office. She joined my Ohio staff the very first year I came to the Senate after a long career at Legal Aid. Her entire life has been dedicated to helping those people in need. In the past 12 years, Margaret has worked on more than 10,000 cases. Those are 10,000 Ohioans whose lives she has touched. Many of these were seniors trying to navigate bureaucracy and get the Social Secu-rity and Medicare benefits they have earned. Margaret went above and be-yond the call of duty for them. She worked on one case for 5 years. It was a complicated one, helping an Ohi-oan who was taken as a baby from Lithuania, brought to a displaced per-sons camp in Germany after World War II, and then finally brought to Amer-ica. They were having trouble finding the documents he needed to prove his eligi-bility for Social Security and Medi-care, two Federal programs for which he had paid in. The case at times seemed hopeless, but Margaret never gave up. This year she was finally able to track down the documents this Ohi-oan needed to secure the benefits he earned. That was par for the course. She worked on another case for a constituent who had been trying to get someone to intervene regarding her mother’s Medicare coverage. The wom-an’s daughter wrote that Margaret’s ‘‘caring, expertise, and knowledge of the medical system and Federal pro-grams cut through all the gobbledy-gook I was facing, and pointed us in the direction of help when not one other agency or politician would.’’ Our office has received so many let-ters of praise and thanks like that for Margaret. One Ohioan wrote to Margaret: 
You and Senator Brown have accomplished what I was beginning to believe was impos-sible—the Social Security backpay was in-deed transferred to my account yesterday. I cannot thank your office enough. I cannot even begin to explain what a Christmas gift this is. I truly was beginning to wonder and worry about how I was going to make ends meet for the next several months. Again, it is par for the course for Margaret Molnar. Another woman wrote after her brother passed away, who Margaret helped in the last years of his life: 
I will never forget how much you have helped enrich Robert’s life while he was with us. Forever, we will be grateful. You imme-diately responded to my email and got the ball rolling and never gave up on Robert. You are like family. 
Another woman wrote: 
I did not know how to fight this type of issue, it seemed bigger than life to me. You truly have done a wonderful job. I appreciate you stepping in for me . . . your office truly cares about people. 
In a last note, another couple wrote: ‘‘I hope Senator Brown knows how for-tunate he is to have you on his staff.’’ I know that, and Ohio knows that.

TRIBUTE TO BETH THAMES Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise to honor the career of an indispensable member of my staff, Elizabeth Thames. Beth has been with my office for over 20 years—all 12 years in the Senate and about a decade in the House before that. Now, after serving the people of Ohio for these 20-plus years, Beth retires at the end of the year. She joined our of-fice after working as an editor at the Elyria Chronicle-Telegram. Far from being the enemy of the people, Beth knew what journalism was, knew how important it is, and knew to tell sto-ries to help people, to afflict the com-fortable, and to comfort the afflicted. Beth brought that same spirit to our office. She helped our office to connect with the community in Northeast Ohio and around the State. She writes down the name of every single Ohioan we meet together so we can better serve them. Her work has had an amazing impact on the people of Ohio. At meetings, at roundtables, and at community events, she listens and she learns about problems. She under-stands what Lincoln was talking about when he said: Go out and get your pub-lic opinion. She listens to people who don’t often get listened to, and she is a voice for people whose voices are often not heard. In 2012 and 2013, she began hearing more and more about infant mor-tality—a huge problem in our State, particularly for African-American ba-bies. Frankly, State government didn’t seem to give a damn. Constituents would bring up this issue over and over, but no one was doing anything about it. She started calling around. She met with anyone who would talk to her about what the State and Fed-eral Government could do. She called Arthur James, a doctor on the faculty at Ohio State and at the Nationwide Children’s Hospital. He was sounding that alarm. He met with Beth and told her how bad things were. A crisis at the time, Ohio—a generally wealthy State, which could do so much better were it not for corrupt State government—had the third highest in-fant mortality rate in the country, and ranked last for African-American ba-bies. Beth started this conversation before many people were paying attention. She pushed every level of government to take this seriously. She talked with public health departments, with home visiting programs, with hospitals, with nurses, with doctors. She started con-versations with legislators and legisla-tive staff about what we could do on the Federal level, the State level, and the local level. It is because of her that we passed and President Obama signed the bipar-tisan Sudden Unexpected Death Data Enhancement and Awareness Act. It is because of Beth that we wrote to the Consumer Product Safety Commission and got them to add warnings to crib bumpers to promote safe sleep. It is because of Beth’s hard work that then-Secretary of HHS Sylvia Mathews Burwell visited my hometown of Mans-field, OH, to see the great work that the Doctors Redding—husband and wife, two doctors in Mansfield, OH, my hometown—were doing and to see the great work they and community health workers were doing to help moms have healthy pregnancies and deliver healthy babies. The change was dra-matic in the number of healthy babies who were born as a result of the work of all of them. We have more to do, but all of Beth’s efforts have given our State important tools to pay attention to monitor this problem and to figure out how to solve it. For Beth, of course, it wasn’t just in-fant mortality. Any time she heard about an issue in a meeting or round-table, any time she heard about how our office could look and search for and find problems and find ways to be help-ful, she was. She called agencies and of-fices. She talked with legislative staff. She always tried to find a solution. She heard from veterans about the challenges using GI education benefits. This year she spearheaded our first stu-dent veterans conference. We spread around the State to help student vet-erans, soldiers, sailors, air men and women, and marines who come back after serving to integrate into class-rooms in a difficult situation, where they are around college students who are usually younger than they and didn’t have their life experience. She connects those student veterans with resources that allow them to the get the most out of the benefits. For all of her efforts, Beth never sought recognition. She is generally quiet as a person. I can imagine her right now telling me to stop. She doesn’t need all this fuss. This fall, the Elyria NAACP gave her an award—something she probably

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST— H.R. 1677 Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, I come here today to talk about an issue that has been talked about quite a bit here on the floor today, and that is the situ-ation in Syria. I know there has been a lot of debate today about what is hap-pening there and what happened today in Syria. But I bring to the floor today some-thing that I think should get the unan-imous consent of everyone. The House passed this resolution some time ago. It was by voice vote—no recorded ‘‘no’’ votes. It was essentially a unanimous consent bill. When I am through with this, I am hoping everyone here will agree with me that this is the right thing to do and something that will actually ad-dress the situation that is taking place in Syria. This bill declares that it is U.S. pol-icy to use all diplomatic and economic means to compel the government of Bashar al-Assad to stop the slaughter of the Syrian people and work toward a democratic government. The use of sanctions are a critical tool of U.S. for-eign policy, and that is what we are talking about here today—the imple-mentation of additional sanctions. They often allow the United States to have a strong impact on a country and serve the U.S. national security inter-ests without having to implement mili-tary measures and put U.S. troops in harm’s way. I believe—and most of us believe— that H.R. 1677 helps meet those inter-ests. How does it work? Here is how it works. First of all, it imposes fresh sanctions on entities conducting busi-ness with the Assad regime and its military and intelligence agencies. A number of regime-controlled indus-tries—including in the airline, tele-communications, and energy sectors— will also be targeted. It aims to encourage negotiations by allowing the President to waive sanc-tions if the parties are engaged in meaningful negotiations and the vio-lence against civilians has ceased. The bill also authorizes the Sec-retary of State to support entities that are collecting and preserving evidence for the eventual prosecution of those who committed war crimes and crimes against humanity in Syria from March 2011 to the present and requires the President to report to Congress on the identity of those who are responsible for or complicit with gross violations of human rights of the Syrian people. There is no doubt that we are going to get to that point. It is not going to happen tomorrow, and it is not going to happen the next day, but no one on Earth can do the kinds of things that Assad has done to his own people. We all know that there have been poisonous substances used and weapons of mass destruction used by Assad against his people. Eventually, those who are responsible are going to have to face the music for that, and they are going to have to be prosecuted for that. This bill helps to preserve the evi-dence and the identity of those who are involved in that. As I noted, the House passed this some time ago, and vir-tually without resistance. On Novem-ber 30, the administration issued a White House statement supporting H.R. 1677. The administration said: 
The bill would add to a robust set of tools at the Administration’s disposal to help bring to an end the heartbreaking ongoing tragedy in Syria and to hold Syrian officials accountable for the slaughter of civilians and other atrocities. This bill will help pro-vide additional leverage to achieve the United States government’s objective to de- escalate the military conflict and support the United Nations-led peace process and a transition to a government in Syria that honors the will of the Syrian people, respects the rule of law and human rights, and peace-fully co-exists with its neighbors in the re-gion. 
The bill effectively targets the Assad regime and its supporters with addi-tional financial sanctions and some crippling economic tools. We have all seen some very recent examples of how well our sanctions have worked be-cause of the United States’ position in the banking industry and, indeed, in the world economic structure. In order for us to get the Iranians out of Syria and help bring a permanent defeat of ISIS, we must pursue a politi-cally negotiated solution that will have a major change in the current Syrian regime structure. The Syrian people are a noble people. Their culture has been an organization that has ex-isted since Biblical times. These are a noble people, a good people as a popu-lation, and they do not deserve this. From a humanitarian perspective, this legislation expresses the long overdue outrage for the 500,000 Syrians killed by the Syrian dictator, Iranian forces, and their allies. Dictators are evil. Whether they are religious or secular, royals or oligarchs, they are evil. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-sent that the Senate proceed to the im-mediate consideration of Calendar No. 620, H.R. 1677; that the committee-re-ported amendment be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be considered read a third time and passed, and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Kentucky. Mr. PAUL. Reserving the right to ob-ject, today President Trump announced that we have won the war against ISIS in Syria. Our troops are coming home. Thank you, Mr. President. The Syrian civil war is largely over, but Syria is a mess and desperately needs reconstruction. These sanctions will delay—and possibly prevent—the reconstruction of Syria and the begin-ning of a healing time. Now is the time for diplomacy. There are many actors—including Russia, Iran, Turkey, the United States, and others—but this is the time for diplomacy, not for new sanctions. So I object. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-tion is heard. The Senator from Idaho. Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, to respond briefly, with all due respect to my friend and colleague, the Senator from Kentucky, I respectfully urge that this is exactly what is needed to encourage the diplomacy that he wants, that I want, that all of us want. As far as discouraging that, this reso-lution actually gives the President the authority to grant waivers when and if they finally get to the diplomatic track. So with all due respect, I disagree with that. I understand he has the right to object to this. It is unfortu-nate. We had the 435 members of the House hotline this here. There are 99 Members here who signed off on this legislation. It is very unfortunate. The Syrian people do not deserve the treatment they are getting from Assad, and this resolution is aimed directly at stopping it. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant bill clerk pro-ceeded to call the roll. Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST— H.R. 4887 Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, the Federal Government awards more than $600 billion in grant awards—$600 bil-lion. We actually do more in grant awards than we do in contracting. Our current system is riddled with out-dated reporting mechanisms that bur-den grant recipients and inhibit over-sight from Agencies in Congress. The bill, H.R. 4887, which is called the GREAT Act—Grant Reporting Effi-ciency and Agreements Transparency Act—tries to put some sense into this process. This is a process that has worked with all of the grant requesting Agencies. Whether they be universities, whether they be entities for research, they have all gone through this for the past couple of years, actually. They have given a tremendous amount of input because they struggle in actually requesting the grants and in getting through all of the chaos of those grants. The OMB and other entities are not getting the data information to the American people, so there is no trans-parency in that process. For the past couple of years, we have worked very hard to establish a good process of get-ting transparency and also of helping the grant-requesting entities get a more efficient process. The GREAT Act would require, with-in 1 year, OMB and the leading grant Agency to establish a governmentwide data standard for information related to Federal awards. Within 2 years, guidance must be issued for grant-mak-ing Agencies on how to apply those standards and implement them into the existing reporting practices. With-in 3 years, Agencies must ensure that all grants and cooperative agreements use the new data standard for future information requests. This is excep-tionally important to get through the process so that we are not squandering $600 billion in grants. Let me tell you what this process has gone through. In February, H.R. 4887 passed unani-mously out of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. Then it went to the House Calendar, and it passed unanimously on September 26. Every Democrat and every Republican in the House voted for this. Subse-quently, Senator E
NZIand I passed our amended Senate companion to H.R. 4887. It passed unanimously out of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee in September. The bill being considered today is re-flective of bipartisan support from both the House and the Senate. This bill, H.R. 4887, cleared the Republican hot-line weeks ago. Every single Repub-lican has already cleared this. They want the transparency in the grant process and want a better grant process for all of the grant requesters. It is not yet clear on the Democratic side. My simple request doesn’t just come from me. This request comes from the Grant Professionals Association, the National Grants Management Associa-tion, the Association of Government Accountants, the American Library Association, the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition. Leading universities around the coun-try have just asked to improve this grant-making process. Every single Democrat in the House has affirmed this, and every Republican in the House and every Republican in the Senate has already cleared it. We are just asking for this bill to move for-ward and to be passed. I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 4887 and the Senate proceed to its imme-diate consideration. I further ask that the Johnson substitute amendment at the desk be considered and agreed to; that the bill, as amended, be considered read a third time and passed; and that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Ohio. Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, in re-serving the right to object, these are not Mick Mulvaney’s decisions to make—or whatever job Mick Mulvaney happens to be in this week. These are not Alex Azar’s decisions to make. Congress needs to do its job. On behalf of the minority leader, I object. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-tion is heard. The Senator from Oklahoma. Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I am a little confused when every grant- making and requesting organizations— all of the universities around the coun-try—are requesting this. Every single Democrat in the House has already af-firmed this. There does not seem to be a great fear of Mick Mulvaney at the OMB since, by the time this will be im-plemented, it will be 2022. So it is a lit-tle bit confusing to me why getting more transparency in grants and help-ing grant requesting organizations would be controversial. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Minnesota. f 
HEALTHCARE Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise to speak about some of our col-leagues who are leaving the Senate. Be-fore I do that, I want to address what happened late on the Friday night—I think 9 days before Christmas—when a Texas judge basically threw out the Af-fordable Care Act. This latest decision comes more than 6 years after the Supreme Court, in an opinion written by Justice Roberts, al-ready upheld the law’s constitu-tionality. That opinion also found that parts of the law can be severed from the rest of the legislation. It comes after the administration has stated em-phatically that it would not defend the law. So, basically, instead of going in there and helping out to save healthcare for millions of Americans and protect them from being thrown off their insurance if they have pre-existing conditions—instead of going into that burning building—the admin-istration has said to basically stand down and throw lighter fluid on the fire. That is exactly what has hap-pened. If this ruling takes effect, the consequences will be devastating. To start, protections for people with preexisting conditions would be gone. About half of all Americans have pre-existing conditions. This isn’t just about rare diseases. This is also about asthma and diabetes. The ability to keep your kids on your insurance plans until they are 26 years old will be gone. The work we have done to close the Medicare doughnut hole coverage gap, which makes it easier for our seniors to afford pharmaceuticals and to lower prescription drug prices, will be gone. The provisions that help people to buy insurance on the healthcare exchanges will be gone. Minnesotans will see a loss of $364 million in premium tax credits, and, roughly, 272,000 people in my State will lose coverage. We can’t allow this to happen. The judge must issue a stay immediately until the appeals are completed so that these protections can stay in place and this decision can be overturned. It is time to stop trying to start from scratch. The American people spoke in this last election across the country. Do they want improvements to the Af-fordable Care Act, like making phar-maceuticals less expensive and doing something about premiums? Yes, they do, but they don’t want to start from scratch. We have already seen what kind of healthcare proposals we get when we start from scratch—the ones that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have put forward. The legislation that we saw earlier this Congress would have hurt people by kicking millions off of Medicaid, by letting insurance companies charge people more when they get sick, and by jacking up healthcare costs. Every major group that you trust when it comes to your health—the largest groups of doctors, nurses, seniors, hospitals, people with cancer, Alzheimer’s, heart disease, and diabetes—has said it was the worst re-peal bill yet. We cannot spend the next 2 years going backward and fighting

old fights. We need to focus on building on the work we have done and strengthening and improving the Af-fordable Care Act. I have always said that the Afford-able Care Act was the beginning and not an end, and we all have heard from those on the frontlines; doctors, pa-tients, seniors, and those working to combat the opioid epidemic say that repeal is not the way forward. We should now be governing from oppor-tunity and not from chaos. It means passing reinsurance pro-grams, like the bipartisan legislation, which I am proud to cosponsor, that Senator A
LEXANDER and Senator M UR-
RAY put forth, and using ideas that have worked in Minnesota and taking them out on a national basis. It means doing something about sky-rocketing pharmaceutical prices and passing my bill that has over 30 co-sponsors to allow Medicare to nego-tiate for less expensive drugs under their Medicare part D—literally lifting the ban that says that the 41 million seniors of this country shouldn’t be al-lowed to get a better deal. It means passing my bill with Sen-ator G
RASSLEY , which we just improved upon today, to limit anti-competitive pay-for-delay deals, which delay more affordable generic drugs from getting out on the market. It means allowing less expensive, safe drugs to come in from other countries so that we can have true competition. We could even put it to a trigger so that if there were not competition, then you could allow the safe drugs to be purchased from other countries, and I think that it would create a major in-centive for drug prices to go down. What we need to do is work together on the many bipartisan proposals that have been put forward to actually im-prove the Affordable Care Act, not throw it out and not throw people who have preexisting conditions off their insurance.

TRIBUTE TO DEPARTING SENATORS Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I have already given speeches in this Chamber about my four friends, depart-ing Democratic colleagues, Senators H
EITKAMP , M CCASKILL , N ELSON , and D
ONNELLY . Now I rise to recognize my Republican colleagues who are leaving the Senate. Let me start with O
RRIN HATCH , who is truly one of a kind. Out of 100 Senators, none of us can say that our great-grandfather founded the town of Vernal, UT, home of the Dinosaur Roundup Rodeo. None of us can say that we served as a Mormon bishop or that we started off working as a janitor to pay for school and then went on to become the most senior Re-publican in the U.S. Senate. None of us can say that we moonlight as a singer, songwriter, and famed lyri-cist, whose catalogue includes the classics: ‘‘Heal Our Land,’’ ‘‘Eight Days of Hanukkah,’’ and his ode to Manhat-tan, ‘‘Skatin’ with My Baby.’’ ORRIN H
ATCH ’s songs have been featured in the movies ‘‘Oceans 12’’ and ‘‘Stuart Little 2.’’ While Senator H
ATCH takes pride in all of his accomplishments, I know that he is proudest of his family: his wife, Elaine; their six children; 23 grandchildren; and 24 great-grand-children. Senator H
ATCH and I have worked to-gether for a long period of time. He was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 1976, and I also got my start in elected life that year as the secretary-treasurer of my 10th grade high school class. Wash-ingtonian Magazine once named us the two Senators least likely to get into a scandal, which I assume includes with each other. We are both members of the Senate prayer group. One time I will never for-get was when he was speaking at the National Prayer Breakfast and his phone started ringing and he had to improvise in front of the entire Na-tional Prayer Breakfast. He said that God was calling him with prayer advice as he answered the cell phone. Most of all, we have teamed up on many issues that matter to the Amer-ican people. We are cochairs of the Rare Disease Caucus. We have helped to make our schools safer just this spring by adding $1 mil-lion to improve school security. We led a bipartisan bill that was passed unani-mously in this Chamber, and it was signed into law. We worked together to restore the in-tegrity to our patent system. He also has been a supporter of com-prehensive immigration reform, some-thing we need more of in this Chamber. I will always be grateful for the op-portunity I have had to work with Sen-ator H
ATCH , someone who has dedi-cated his life to serving his State and country for more than 40 years. I also want to honor the service of my colleague from Arizona, Senator J
EFF FLAKE , whom I have truly en-joyed working with during our time to-gether in the Senate. J
EFFhas never invited me to travel with him to a deserted island, as he did with Senator H
EINRICH , but we did once stay with J
EFFand his wife, Cheryl, at John and Cindy McCain’s ranch, and let’s just say it had a few more amen-ities than he had on the island with Senator H
EINRICH . During that memorable visit to Sedona, I saw firsthand how dedicated J
EFFis to his family. I remember how early he got up one morning to travel to his son Tanner’s track meet. That afternoon he actually sent me a photo of Tanner taken after he had won the event. I also have seen how much he loves his home State. At heart, he is a fifth- generation Arizonan, one of 11 kids who grew up on a cattle ranch in the town of Snowflake. That land had first been owned by his great-great-grand-father, who had come to Arizona in 1878, and then it was passed down gen-eration to generation. I learned a lot about the Flake fam-ily history through JEFF’s book, which I once read in its entirety on Christmas Day. What I most remember from that book was that growing up, J
EFF’s fam-ily had a card on the refrigerator, and this is what it said: ‘‘Assume the best. Look for the good.’’ It is that unshakeable sense of opti-mism and faith in the decency of other people that Senator F
LAKE has brought to the U.S. Senate. He has been willing to work across the aisle to do what he thinks is right, even when it has some-times meant breaking with his own party. J
EFFknows what is at stake, for in-stance, with immigration reform. He wrote in his book: ‘‘From a very young age in ranch country, you get to know immigrants intimately and honestly’’ and you know ‘‘how indispensable they are to making things work in Amer-ica.’’ It is clear that those lessons have stayed with him. I have seen it as J
EFF has worked to build bipartisan con-sensus on immigration issues, reaching across the aisle to find a solution to try to protect our Dreamers. I have seen it when we joined to-gether to introduce a resolution, the two of us, recognizing the contribu-tions of Muslim Americans. That reso-lution passed the Senate because J
EFF F
LAKE was willing to cosponsor it with me. I have seen these values as Senator F
LAKE has worked with a bipartisan group of us to normalize relations with Cuba. This commitment dates back decades to his earlier experience in building democracy in Namibia. So when President Obama took up the cause of Cuba, J
EFFdid not hesitate to lend his support, and together Senator F
LAKE and I led the bill to lift the em-bargo on Cuba, along with Senators E
NZI, LEAHY , and many others. J
EFF’s voice has been particularly needed lately in the face of grave threats to our democracy and the rule of law. He has been a strong advocate for this bipartisan legislation that the Senate Judiciary Committee passed to simply protect the work of the special counsel, and he has taken a stand to try to ensure that the bill gets a vote on the Senate floor. As a daughter of a journalist, I also deeply appreciate Senator F
LAKE ’s leadership on behalf of a free press, which is essential to our democracy. At a time when journalists are under attack, when reporters are risking and losing their lives and the President is calling them ‘‘the enemy of the peo-ple,’’ it has never been more important for us to speak out for the First Amendment. So when J
EFFFLAKE took to the Senate floor in support of free-dom of the press earlier this year, I was proud to speak after him. While J
EFFwill be so missed in the Senate, I have no doubt that he will

ORKER  over the years. I will tell you that Sen-ator C
ORKER never misses Senator M
CCASKILL ’s annual chili party. He has been very good to us, and we have worked together for years. Before becoming a Senator, B
OB C
ORKER had two previous experiences as an elected official. He was the mayor of Chattanooga and the presi-dent of a high school class. He claims that he did not even have to campaign for that job. Here is what he said: ‘‘I just woke up one day and was presi-dent.’’ That is not how it usually works in politics. It turns out that B
OB’s roots were ac-tually, of course, in business. He saved up $8,000 to start his own construction company at age 25 and then expanded it to 17 other States, and he has brought this commonsense business background to tackle difficult prob-lems head-on, while always calling it as he sees it. We have seen that in his chairman-ship of the Foreign Relations Com-mittee, where B
OBhas spoken up to de-fend the values that define America, including strongly stating that he felt this Chamber and the administration had to do more in response to the mur-der of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. We have seen it as Senator C
ORKER  has worked to strengthen our alliances. I can tell you, when I was having trou-ble getting the nominees to be Ambas-sadors to Sweden and Norway through the Congress last Congress, which is very important in my State with its Scandinavian roots, I knew that I could count on his support. We have seen it in his efforts to com-bat human trafficking, an issue I also care deeply about. B
OBhas so much to be proud of at the end of his chapter of public service and begins another back home in Ten-nessee. Finally, I want to recognize my friend and colleague, Senator D
EAN H
ELLER of Nevada. D
EAN has dedicated so much of his life to public service on behalf of his State—in Nevada’s legislature, as sec-retary of state, in Congress, and in the U.S. Senate. His family moved to Nevada when he was only 9 months old. As the son of an auto mechanic and a school cook, he has often said that he is likely one of the only Senators who can change your oil and fix your transmission. Nevada is obviously a State with no shortage of tourism, and D
EAN has worked with me as cochairs of the tourism caucus to promote tourism across our entire country. He under-stands that when we increase tourism, we not only create jobs and strengthen our economy, we also strengthen our alliances and export our values. It is that same philosophy that is be-hind his efforts, along with Senator FLAKE who is here in this Chamber, to normalize relations with Cuba. D
EAN and I traveled to Cuba, along with Sen-ator F
LAKE , with President Obama, and I deeply appreciated his commitment, as well as Senator F
LAKE ’s and others, to improving the relationship between our countries and opening up new op-portunities for American businesses. I have valued our time together on the Commerce Committee, where we led bills that passed and were signed into law regarding more women getting into science, technology, engineering, and math at NASA. We are proud that both bills were signed into law. I have enjoyed serving with D
EAN H
ELLER in the U.S. Senate, and I thank him for his service. Thank you. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Maryland.

HEALTHCARE Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I take this time to talk about the recent court decision concerning the Afford-able Care Act. I see that Senator F
LAKE is on the floor. I was listening to my colleague, Senator K
LOBUCHAR , talk about the four colleagues on the Republican side who will be leaving. I have already had a chance in the Foreign Relations Com-mittee to talk about Senator F
LAKE , but I want him to know, and I want the American people to know, that there is no finer Senator than Senator F
LAKE . He has shown great integrity on for-eign policy issues, on decency issues, and on his principles. I will never forget our visit to the southern part of Africa, where Senator F
LAKE was a missionary when he was a little bit younger, and his passion for the people and their needs has never stopped. That is just one example. I can name many more examples of how Senator F
LAKE has inspired all of us. The courage that he has shown has been an inspiration. I wish him the best as he moves on to the next chapter in his life. I rise today to discuss America’s ac-cess to healthcare and the patient pro-tections that are currently being threatened by President Trump and his administration; specifically, his deci-sion to not uphold the Patient Protec-tion and Affordable Care Act, the law of the land. Last week, Judge Reed O’Connor of the U.S. District Court for the North-ern District of Texas ruled that the Af-fordable Care Act is unconstitutional and that the law is not severable from and cannot stand without the indi-vidual mandate penalty, which Repub-licans eliminated in their December 2017 tax bill. While this ruling is being appealed, President Trump has the op-portunity to stand up for the American people. Over and over again, we have heard President Trump promise to lower pre-scription drug prices for seniors, end the opioid epidemic, and improve the availability and affordability of health insurance. Yet, for any of his proposed policies to succeed, President Trump needs the Affordable Care Act, even though he will not admit it. Without the Affordable Care Act, which closed the doughnut hole for sen-iors, many older Americans would like-ly spend around $2,000 more in out-of- pocket costs for prescription drugs each year. Rather than helping our seniors lower costs, with the loss of the protection under the Affordable Care Act—the benefits—they will end up paying more. Furthermore, the Affordable Care Act created the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation, which is the basic infrastructure for the Trump ad-ministration to test the recently re-leased drug-pricing proposals. Without the ACA, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation would not exist, and President Trump would need con-gressional approval to implement such a sweeping national test on drug prices. We all should be committed to reduc-ing the cost of prescription drugs in this country. The President ran on that when he was Candidate Trump. We know that as Americans we pay so much more than people from other industrialized nations for the same drugs, many of which are manufac-tured right here in America. The ACA—the Affordable Care Act—helped us move in the right direction. We need to build on that. Let us work together to preserve the progress we have made under the Affordable Care Act and to pass additional legislation allowing us to use the collective bargaining power of our consumers so that we can pay lower prices than our friends from Can-ada because we have a bigger market. We should be paying lower—not twice as much. President Trump says that he wants to end the opioid epidemic. By getting rid of the Affordable Care Act, he will cause millions of Americans to lose their current health insurance. This is because any rollback in Medicaid cov-erage, the biggest payer for behavioral healthcare, would result in roughly 1.2 million people with addiction and men-tal health issues losing access to af-fordable treatment. If you don’t have insurance protec-tion for behavioral health or addiction, you are going to be much less likely to be able to get access to that needed treatment in order to deal with your addiction. We know we need a comprehensive approach to deal with the opioid crisis. Yes, we want to stop the dangerous drug fentanyl from coming into this country. Yes, we want to stop the dis-tribution of illegal drugs. But we also

have to deal with the reality of people who have addictions, and they need to be able to get help. Part of that is hav-ing access to care and having coverage. The elimination of the Affordable Care Act will move us in the wrong direc-tion. We need to continue to build on legis-lation we have worked on together—bi-partisan—that provides additional re-sources to our State and local govern-ments to deal with the opioid crisis. Part of that is the expansion of cov-erage under the Affordable Care Act. Scrapping the healthcare law will not only leave Medicaid expansion enroll-ees high and dry; it will also hurt very vulnerable populations that were un-able to buy affordable, comprehensive coverage before the Affordable Care Act, including more than 130 million women, children, and other people with preexisting conditions. Let’s remember that prior to the Af-fordable Care Act, many Americans— millions of Americans—were denied full coverage because of preexisting condition restrictions. The Maryland Health Benefit Exchange estimates that in Maryland, there are approxi-mately 2.5 million non-elderly Mary-landers with preexisting conditions, 320,000 of whom are children. They are at risk with this court decision in Texas. Undoing current law would also eliminate strong patient protection. Insurers would once again be able to impose annual and lifetime limits, dis-criminate against women, and charge higher out-of-pocket costs. Young adults would no longer be able to stay on their parents’ insurance until they turn 26. We are talking about tens of millions of Americans who are at risk by this court decision. It is absurd to move back and tell these people they are going to lose the protection they now have under our healthcare system. It is simple. President Trump must take this opportunity to stand up for the American people and defend the law. That is what the President of the United States should be doing. That is why I joined Senator M
ANCHIN and many of my Democratic colleagues in a letter urging President Trump to di-rect the Department of Justice to de-fend the law of the land. Yes, we should defend the law. It is our responsibility to make sure we protect the people of this Nation. Let’s build on the progress we have made together. We know we need to improve our healthcare system. We know the cost of prescription drugs is too high. We can do something about that. We know the individual market-place needs improvement. We want to make sure there is affordable, quality insurance for everyone in this country. Yes, we need to build on the progress we have made to make improvement, but what I urge all of us to do—let’s maintain the protections we have today. Let’s not go back to the time when being a woman was a preexisting condition and you couldn’t get full cov-erage. Let’s not go back to the days when, if you had a heart ailment and you tried to buy an insurance policy, you were not going to get coverage for what you need. You were going to get those exclusions. That is where we were before we passed the Affordable Care Act. Let’s build on the Affordable Care Act. Let’s work together as Democrats and Republicans. Let’s defend the progress we have made. I hope the President will join us, but let’s take that responsibility and build on that and work together, Democrats and Re-publicans, to build a stronger system for all.

PUBLIC LANDS BILL Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I appre-ciate that and thank the Senator. Look, we are at the end of the year. Oftentimes in this body, things happen at the end of the year that we are not too proud of, but we have an oppor-tunity to do something we could be very, very proud of, and that is, pass the public lands bill. This public lands bill would perma-nently reauthorize the Land and Water Conservation Fund. This is the most ef-fective conservation tool we have in this country right now. Whether it is establishing a park in one of your cit-ies or towns or setting land aside so we can get better access to our public lands, this is a critically important fund that I hope we can get done as part of this lands package that is mov-ing forward and hopefully will move forward before this Congress ends. LWCF—the Land and Water Con-servation Fund—has invested over half a billion dollars in Montana alone. There is another component of this bill that I am particularly fond of. It is a bill that will protect Yellowstone Park and the headwaters of the Yellow-stone River. It is called the Yellow-stone Gateway Protection Act. It is a simple bill. It is a bipartisan bill. It is a bill that will help support the hun-dreds of small businesses in Paradise Valley. And it is called Paradise Valley for a good reason—because it is para-dise, and we need to keep it a paradise by preventing large-scale mining in that region. I am just asking Congress to act. I am asking my fellow Members, my fel-low Senators to add some common-sense to the negotiations that are mov-ing on here and pass this lands bill be-cause it is critically important for our kids and our grandkids. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Georgia.

FUNDING THE GOVERNMENT Mr. PERDUE. Mr. President, here we are again at the end of a quarter and the end of a calendar year—not the end of our fiscal year. But here we are again with late-night sessions and peo-ple running around in a very unpro-fessional manner, in my opinion, talk-ing about how to get our government funded. Let me put this in perspective. This is the end of December. October, No-vember, and December are the first fis-cal quarter of fiscal year 2019. We are already one-fourth through this fiscal year, and we are still talking about the completion of authorizations and ap-propriations to fund the government for this year—not next year, this year. In 2018, the Senate and, indeed Con-gress did something we haven’t done in a long time. For the first time in 22 years, we did get 75 percent of the Fed-eral Government discretionary spend-ing funded. By the way, that is only about 25 percent of what we spend as a federal government, but that is a con-versation for another day. On July 31 this year and earlier than that—we started the appropriations process earlier this year and had an op-portunity in the Appropriations Com-mittee. The subcommittees and the committee did a fabulous job this year. Democrats and Republicans got to-gether behind closed doors, no cameras, and really argued the points and came to compromises on most of the issues, so that by July 31, we had funded 12.25 percent of this year’s Federal budget for discretionary spending. We decided as a body, with the lead-ership’s approval, to stay here in Au-gust of this year. Because of that, we went from 12.5 percent to 75 percent of the discretionary budget being appro-priated and approved. Indeed, the ap-propriators did their job this year and would have gotten 100 percent had we not had the disagreement over border security. Let’s be clear. As we sit here at the end of this quarter, the Senate should have already totally funded the Fed-eral Government’s discretionary budg-et by September 30 of this year. That was 3 months ago. Instead, what we are about to do is have a vote in the next day or two on a continuing resolution for the remaining portion of this year’s Federal budget, the 25 percent. This will be the 186th continuing resolution this Congress and other Congresses have used to continue to fund the gov-ernment in a temporary manner. I have a major problem with that. First of all, it is an admission that Congress can’t do its job. The No. 1 re-sponsibility of Congress is to make sure the government is funded. It is one of the reasons Thirteen Colonies got together in the first place to form this country. This continuing resolution, as bad as it is, should not be used, but even in its current potential existence, it is so bad for a couple of other reasons. No. 1, it does not address the border security issue on which the President and the Democrats had prior agree-ments. Even just a few weeks ago, we

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES7892 December 19, 2018 
had agreements on some numbers for border security that are not being hon-ored right now. It is like you negotiate to a point, and then one side says: Well, we are going to back up on that. Well, we will agree to this. And then they back up again. The American people are not fooled. This is not an immigration issue any longer. It is clearly a national security issue. The President is right: Over 85 percent of the illegal drugs come into this country illegally across that bor-der. Almost 100 percent of the fentanyl that comes into this country comes across that southern border of the United States illegally. There is a second reason this is such an insidious thing to do right now with this continuing resolution. It is incred-ibly disappointing that this continuing resolution does nothing to address dis-aster relief funding for the people of Florida, Georgia, the Carolinas, Ala-bama, and California who have been devastated by historic wildfires and hurricanes. The reason this is so critical right now is that this hits agriculture in these States in a way that is so insid-ious. The reason is that it hit at ex-actly the harvest time, when crops are being harvested or are potentially going to be harvested. It devastated en-tire regions of that portion of the United States. In December and January, what farmers are typically doing is they have taken the money from the crops, paid back the planting loan from this year to the banks, and now in January will start negotiations for loans for next year for the planting season. What this continuing resolution does is kicks the can down the road until a theoretic date—somebody picked February 8 as an arbitrary date. This devastates farmers and smalltown bankers who are trying to fund next year’s crop be-cause they have no way of paying this year’s. I am absolutely convinced that Presi-dent Trump wants to help these farm-ers and the people in California who have been devastated by these fires. He has said so repeatedly. In October, on a trip to Georgia and Florida, he saw the devastation from the hurricane and the tornadoes that came with it and all the damage that came from that event, and this is what the President said: 
The farmers really got hurt, especially in Georgia. . . . But we’re going to get it taken care of. There is no question that the President of the United States wants to make good on that promise. The problem is, he is dealing with another party that is not being genuine in their effort to find a solution to this fund-ing issue right now. 
Democrats in the House want to clearly push this out into the new year for an obvious reason, and that is what we are pushed to tonight, tomorrow, and the next night. I fully believe the Senate should be back here the day after Christmas, frankly, to debate this, to get to a resolution, to some compromise, to get the benefits that we have identified are necessary to pro-tect this strategic industry of ours called agriculture. I remember that during my career, we would work half a day on Christmas Eve. I remember that. It hasn’t been that long ago. We might take Christ-mas Day off, and then the next day, most people in America are back to work if they are not taking vacation. But here in the Senate, right now, we won’t be back until sometime in Janu-ary, and we have given ourselves until February 8 to resolve this issue. That is unacceptable. I believe it is unac-ceptable to the President. It is cer-tainly unacceptable to a person who comes from the real world as an out-sider to this process. Here is another derivative negative to kicking this can down the road: It not only affects the funding we are talking about this year; it also talks about the planning and budgeting for fiscal year 2020, which starts October 1, 2019. From January 8 until July 31, there are 19 weeks or 57 workdays— only 57, the way the Senate operates today. What that means is that the Senate and the House have to appro-priate 12 appropriations bills—I believe before July 31—in order to fund the government before September 30 next year. Here is why: The August break is a work break, and people in the Senate and the House go home and work in their States during the month in Au-gust. If that happens this year, then when we come back in September, we will have 12 working days in September. There is no way we are going to have any appropriations bills and the con-ferences necessary to get that done in September. It is very clear that this continuing resolution is improper, it should not be done, and it puts the people who have been devastated at risk. And I think that right now, we need to be very seri-ous about one thing, and that is, going forward, we need to find a way to cre-ate a politically neutral platform to fund this government on time every year without all this drama. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Connecticut. f 
SYRIA Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak briefly about the President’s announcement today that he is going to be with-drawing 2,000 American troops from Syria. Let me be clear. I thought this was a bad idea from the start, primarily be-cause our troop presence in Syria is not authorized by Congress. We have had that debate in many forums here, but I believe this Congress has never authorized the U.S. military to engage in hostilities against ISIS. I think it is an extrapolation of the 2001 AUMF. It simply belies common sense. So we should never endorse military activity overseas, no matter what we think about the merits, if it is not authorized by this body. But we have also seen over and over again that our relatively meager mili-tary presence in the Middle East has never been enough to change the polit-ical realities on the ground. The train-ing mission was a disaster. The weap-ons we gave to the rebels ended up in the hands of the people we were fight-ing. Ultimately, we never had enough firepower there to be able to meaning-fully change the balance of power. But I will concede that the way the President went about making this deci-sion makes our country an even bigger laughing stock than it already is in the region, and, frankly, that is pretty hard, because everybody is asking questions right now about why we pre-tended we were going to protect our Kurdish partners in the region if, on the eve of the Turkish offensive against the Kurds, we decide to pull out. It makes absolutely no sense to pre-tend for literally months and months that we are going to be the bulwark to protect the Kurds against the Turks and then right on the precipice of the Turkish offensive, we leave. Why would anybody believe us in the future if we give them our word? Again, I am speaking as someone who didn’t support the intervention in the first place, but once you have made that commitment, why not follow through? Second, why pull the rug out from under our diplomats in the region? It is very clear that neither Jim Jeffrey nor Brett McGurk knew anything about this. In fact, they were just making plans and suggestions weeks ago to in-crease our military involvement in the region, and now they are having to ex-plain why 2,000 troops are leaving. If you are going to make a decision like this, make sure the people who are working for you know about it. Third, why announce this pullout without answering any questions about it or without announcing an alter-native strategy? Total darkness from the President and his national security team. An announcement—a statement made on Twitter and no rollout of a plan for how the United States is going to continue to try to keep the peace. So I agree with many of the criti-cisms that my Republican friends who have come down to the floor have com-plained about. This was done in a ham- handed manner that makes us weaker in the world. But forgive me if I have a few questions about why my Repub-lican friends chose to speak up only now with questions about the Presi-dent’s Syria policy. Where was this outrage when the President of the United States froze millions of dollars in humanitarian funding that could have saved lives on the ground in Syria? If they care so deeply about the future of Syria, why

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S7893 December 19, 2018 
weren’t the Republicans lighting up so-cial media and down on this floor com-plaining about the fact that the Presi-dent refused to forward badly needed humanitarian dollars to the region. Where was the outrage when the President effectively pulled the United States out of the peace process? Re-member, the United States, under the Obama administration—whatever you think about Obama’s strategy—was in the peace process, was a partner to try to figure out a way forward for Syria. Donald Trump, as has been his strategy internationally, pulled us out of that diplomatic conversation, left the diplo-matic playing field to the Iranians, to the Russians, and to the Turks. Where was the outrage when the United States walked away from the negoti-ating table? How about the shutdown of the ref-ugee program? Once again, if your focus is on the cataclysm of humani-tarian disaster on the ground in Syria, why weren’t there all sorts of Members of the Republican Party coming down to the floor and complaining when the President decided to not allow any more Syrian refugees—those fleeing terror and torture—to come to the United States? What about outrage over the fact that the President proposed cutting the State Department by 40 percent— the State Department that is going to be in the driver’s seat when we eventu-ally get to the point of putting Syria back together politically? Why is there outrage only today? Well, here is the answer, I think, and it worries me. I think there is outrage today because many Members of the Republican Party still cling to this outdated, empirically disproved, fan-tastic notion that the American mili-tary can solve complicated, convoluted political problems in the Middle East. We have amazing men and women in the Armed Forces, but there are limits to what they can do. And history—es-pecially the history of the last 15 years—tells us that big U.S. military presence in the Middle East often cre-ates as many problems as it solves. The Republicans who are com-plaining about this make it sound as if we had a couple divisions in Syria. We didn’t. We had 2,000 troops. We had 2,000 troops compared to the hundreds of thousands of troops fighting on be-half of the Syrian regime, the Iranian militias, the Kurdish forces, the rebel forces, the remnants of ISIS’s forces. Two thousand troops isn’t enough to bluff. It isn’t enough to gain a negoti-ating foothold. It is, frankly, just enough to keep faking it in Syria— doing just enough militarily to say that we are doing something to be able to sleep at night while never actually doing anything sufficient to change the balance of power. That has been the story of both President Obama’s and President Trump’s policy in Syria. We do just enough to convince the rebels that they should keep going but never enough to actually tackle Bashar al- Assad. All we have done is keep the civil war running and running and run-ning. I have really terrible news for you all. Assad is going to win this war. He was always going to win this war be-cause the folks who were on his side had much bigger equities—Russia and Iran—than the folks who were on the side of the rebels. Now, that really stinks, that Bashar al-Assad is going to win, but you have to make policy based on the real world, not on some world that you imagine. These neoconservatives are still— even after 4,000 Americans were killed in Iraq and 30,000 were wounded, they are still clinging to this notion that a couple thousand U.S. troops are going to be able to solve the problems in Syria. Listen. I get it. Restraint in the face of evil is really hard stuff. But hu-bris in the face of evil is worse. So what should we be doing? I won’t spend too much time on this, but we should get out of the civil war. We should admit that we have just pro-longed it instead of trying to end it. We should keep working with our partners and keep using airpower to keep ISIS on the run. We should rescue Syrians with a generous refugee program, both helping our partners in the Middle East rescue Syrians and bringing them to the United States when they pass our vetting program. We should stop angering our allies all over the world, but particularly in that region, and get back into the diplo-matic game. Finally, we should stop believing that our only leverage in negotiations in Syria or anywhere else in the world is military force. Put up a promise of massive investment in Syria after a peace deal is signed—likely, frankly, costing a fraction of what we spent in Iraq—and you will discover that you quickly get a seat at that table again. But it is time that we give up on this notion that these brave, capable Amer-ican soldiers can fix these complicated, tribal, political, economic, and reli-gious problems in the Middle East. They are brave, and they are capable, but there are things they can do, and there are things they can’t do. Every time we put our troops in situations where they are doomed to fail, when we are not prepared to give them the re-sources to succeed, as was always the case in Syria—spare me this notion that 2,000 American troops were going to be able to fix Syria—every time we put them in situations where they can’t win, we undermine American in-fluence, and we undermine the power of our military. I don’t agree with how the President did this. Once you have made that com-mitment, boy, it doesn’t make a lot of sense to pull the rug out from under our partners right as the tough stuff starts to come. I don’t agree that he didn’t do it in consultation with any-body in this place or anybody on his national security team. I think that his announcement today is ham-handed and embarrassing, but his instincts aren’t entirely wrong on the question of what American troops can and can’t do in the Middle East. I can’t believe I am saying this. I think the President may have learned more than many of my friends in the Senate have. I yield back. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from South Carolina is recognized. Mr. GRAHAM. I ask unanimous con-sent to be recognized along with my colleague from New Hampshire, Sen-ator S

SYRIA Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I am in distress to be on the floor of the Senate today with my colleague, Sen-ator G
RAHAM , to express our deep and profound disappointment in President Trump’s decision to withdraw U.S. troops from northeast Syria. We had the opportunity to visit Syria this summer, and we saw what a dif-ference our troops had made there in the fight against ISIS in stabilizing Syria along the northern Turkish bor-der. We saw the response from the Syr-ians we talked to, both the Kurds and Arabs, as we drove along the road. We saw children and people in the area flashing a victory sign at our troops, and you can see from this map the land that is controlled by the Syrian Demo-cratic Forces, our partners in Syria, so this is the United States and Syrian Democratic Forces. We have a significant piece of Syria that is now peaceful and stabilized and ISIS has been thrown out of that part of Syria, but the President’s decision— which was announced by a tweet—is dangerous, premature, and wholly in-consistent with the facts on the ground in Syria and our own military’s advice. I was listening to Senator R
UBIO ear-lier today talking about what is the plan? What is the plan if we withdraw? Well, I will tell you what the plan is. There is no plan. There is no follow-on to what we are going to do if we with-draw from Syria. What we know is, the work of our combined joint task force, Operation Inherent Resolve, and its partner forces, the Syrian Democratic Forces, is truly remarkable. Again, we can see it. We can see it in this brown section of the country where we have control and there is peace and sta-bility. Senator G
RAHAM and I, when we vis-ited this summer, we went to Manbij, which was controlled by ISIS for 3 years. We walked through the market in Manbij without any body armor, with no guards. We talked to people in that community about what life was like under ISIS. I talked to one woman who told me she did not go out of her house the en-tire time ISIS controlled Manbij, for 3 years. She went out of her house once to visit the doctor.

We saw women strolling through the market. We saw children playing. We saw people who were happy to be back in their own communities. They said to us: Please stay. We are worried about what will happen if the Americans leave Manbij. We also flew over Kobane, right here on the Turkish border. I remember all of the TV coverage of the fight for Kobane and what it looked like. We could see it was being rebuilt, not with money from the United States but with money from the region. We could see all the building going on. We flew over a center where they were holding some of the most dangerous foreign fighters who had been captured in the fight against ISIS, being held right here in Kobane. Then we went down to Ayn Issa, where we saw, directly, the difference certain forces had made in helping to guard our outposts where our troops were stationed. We saw de-tention facilities where they were hold-ing, again, fighters from Syria who had fought for ISIS. We then went over to Al-Hasakah where we saw a prison that was being built to hold the most dangerous of the foreign fighters. Those foreign fighters who—we don’t know what will happen if we withdraw our troops. There will be nobody there to support the Syrian Democratic Forces that are holding hundreds of those fighters. What hap-pens? Do they get released? Do they come back to the United States and to Europe where they can engineer terrorist attacks? Do they go back into the villages and restart an-other terrorist group? There is no—we don’t know what is going to happen there because there is no follow-on plan. Again, we heard from people every-where we went how important it was to have American troops stationed in Syria—about 2,000 American troops who have made such a huge difference there. They serve a vital shield against ISIS cells that are still operating in Northeast Syria. While the President claims that the threat of ISIS within Syria has dissipated, the conditions on the ground paint a very different pic-ture. So working with our partners we have achieved gains against ISIS be-cause we have partnered with the Syr-ian Democratic Forces that are partly Kurd and partly Arab. If those Syrian Democratic Forces lose the support of the United States, we run the risk of a resurgence of ISIS and the possible ca-pitulation or all-out destruction of Kurdish resistance in the region. What does that mean? That means those ISIS elements are emboldened. They may go underground, but they may reemerge. If we don’t remember history, we are destined to repeat it. That is what happened in Iraq. We left al-Qaida, moved to Syria, and they re-emerged as an even bigger threat. If we leave, it is not at all clear what is going to happen. These are hard-fought gains that are critical to ensuring that we win the fight against terrorism in the Middle East. If we leave, we are going to cede influence in that region to Russia, to Iran, to Assad. In fact, just moments after this decision was announced this morning, we heard the chair of Russia’s State Duma, the chair of the Defense Committee, Vladimir Shamanov said: ‘‘U.S. plans in Syria had failed,’’ and he added that we, the United States, had decided to make this knight’s move in order to avoid a ‘‘shameful end.’’ Make no mistake. They are cele-brating in Moscow tonight after the President’s announcement, just like they are celebrating in Tehran tonight because of the President’s announce-ment because we are going to leave the field in Syria to those countries that are aggressors against the United States. I urge President Trump to listen to his military and diplomatic advisers before he goes any further on this shortsighted decision. It is important to understand that U.S. leadership is essential to com-pletely defeating ISIS and to bringing an end to the violence in Syria. It is also important to reassure our allies that America keeps its word; that when partnering with us, we are there to support you. If we leave now, what does that say to anybody else in the fu-ture who may want to partner with the United States on any conflict? It says: You can’t count on the United States because we may just pull out on you tomorrow if the President suddenly thinks it is in his interests—not in the interests of the United States but in his interest to withdraw. This is a reckless decision, and it is undoubtedly going to have con-sequences for years to come for our military and for our ability to partner with others internationally. The only ones who are going to benefit from this decision are our enemies. So I am pleased to partner with Sen-ator G
RAHAM on a resolution that would express the sense of the Senate that we should not be withdrawing our troops from Syria, that there is too much at stake here for us to take this reckless action and send the wrong message to our partners in the rest of the world. I am pleased to join my colleague, Senator G
RAHAM , and we will do every-thing we can to urge the President to reverse this reckless decision. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from South Carolina. Mr. GRAHAM. I thank my colleague from New Hampshire. Let me ask the question, when we went to Syria and Iraq together, did anyone in the military suggest to you that withdrawing in the foreseeable fu-ture was a good idea? Mrs. SHAHEEN. Absolutely not. In fact, they talked about how pleased they were with the gains we had made, with the partnership, with the SDF, with what they were seeing in terms of stabilizing those communities, people coming back to their homes, rebuild-ing, and how important it was for us to stay there. Mr. GRAHAM. Did they also not say that the Syrian Democratic Forces were some of the best allies we had since 9/11? Mrs. SHAHEEN. Without a doubt, and we saw that firsthand, as you re-member. When we saw them guarding our outposts, when we saw them in the communities, when we saw them in the detention facilities, trying to abide by international standards with respect to the foreign fighters they were guard-ing, it was very impressive. Mr. GRAHAM. Did anyone suggest to you that the war against ISIS in Syria was over and had been won? Mrs. SHAHEEN. Not at all. In fact, if you look at this map, you can see this orange color. That is one of the pock-ets that remains of ISIS. Right here. We have not yet eradicated ISIS, and that does not account for some of the cells that exist throughout this area. Mr. GRAHAM. Do you remember being told that thousands of ISIS fight-ers had gone back into the fabric of Syria and that they will reemerge under the right conditions? Mrs. SHAHEEN. Absolutely, and it is what we saw in Iraq. Mr. GRAHAM. Well, I just want to state that this has been a long strug-gle. Most Americans, all things being equal, would like to get all of our troops home. The Middle East is a very com-plicated place. I share the President’s desire to withdraw our forces when it makes sense. As to the public at large, I want to stress that having been in the military for quite a while, I am very aware of the sacrifices required to go overseas and serve in Iraq, Syria, and Afghanistan. I have come to conclude that a presence over there is still nec-essary to keep us safe here. There is a division in this body about whether we should have a wall as part of border security. I think we need a wall as part of border security to se-cure our southern border. Every Demo-crat is for border security; we just maybe have a different way of doing it. What I tried to tell the President, with apparently very little effect, is that you are right to want to secure our border because drugs are coming across, criminals are coming across, and illegal immigration is a problem in the country, and securing the border is part of the solution, but I told him I don’t know of any way to defend the Nation from radical Islam by building a wall. There is no wall we can build be-tween us and the forces of radical Islam that reside in Africa and the Mideast—places like Syria and Iraq. I tried to convey to him that our de-ployed forces, in partnership with oth-ers, is a virtual wall. It is the best hope we have of stopping another 9/11, pro-tecting ourselves and our allies; that a forward deployed presence gives us eyes and ears on the ground, working with others to protect the homeland

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S7895 December 19, 2018 
and to destroy over time the scourge called radical Islam. The partnership between us and the Syrian forces, which has been mostly Kurds, has been very successful. I want to compliment the Senator from New Hampshire for taking the floor and expressing a resolve to main-tain a fairly small military footprint in Syria and having connected to that our own national security interests. Maybe the good news—if there is any from today—is that Democrats and Re-publicans, after 16 or 17 years of look-ing at this war, are beginning to come together—that troops are necessary sometimes in some places where mili-tary action alone will not win the war but is certainly necessary, and that partners are a good thing. I have come to conclude that when it comes to the war on terrorism, I would rather fight it in the enemy’s backyard than ours. I would rather have partners than do it alone. I think the decision today by the President—and I think it was his alone—is disastrous to our own national security and those 2,200 whom Senator S
HAHEEN talked about and the great job they have done; that by with-drawing them, we have basically taken a part of the wall down and have now an open-border policy when it comes to ISIS in Syria; that the consequence of this decision makes it far more likely that there will be a corridor from Tehran into Lebanon and to Hezbollah. Our presence there made it more dif-ficult to the Iranians. Who would be celebrating this deci-sion? Everybody whom we hate likes what is going on. The Russians are up to no good all over the world. Their statement says everything you need to know about this decision. The only rea-son they are not dancing in Tehran and ISIS camps is they just don’t believe in dancing. They are as happy as they will ever be—and they are not into being happy. To the President, you won the elec-tion. You beat me and many others. You have the right to make this deci-sion, but the Congress has the duty to hold you accountable. I wish we had done more of this in a bipartisan fash-ion when President Obama withdrew from Iraq. If I am nothing, I am con-sistent. I want this President to be suc-cessful. I will help him at every turn. Generally speaking, I am very pleased with his domestic policy and most of the time his foreign policy. I am shocked by this. I think this is a decision that is against sound military advice. I intend to do our part as a Congress to make sure that history records how this decision was made. There is a clear record that President Obama’s decision to withdraw from Iraq and not leave a residual force proved to be wrong and was against military advice at that time. I have yet to find one person in the administra-tion of the national security team who thinks this decision was a good deci-sion. This was made against sound military advice. I don’t think ‘‘General Trump’’ is going to be any better than ‘‘General Obama.’’ I don’t think ‘‘General Gra-ham’’ is the answer to this problem. I think those who are in the fight, who have been doing it for 17 years—the na-tional security team the President has—are the experts. Mr. President, if you don’t like them or trust them, fire them. What you have done, in my view, is set us back. The chatter out there is pretty dis-turbing. I talked with General Mattis today. It is pretty clear that the ripple effect of this is going to be as bad as we think it will be. To our Kurdish partners, I am sorry. I don’t support this decision, and I am hoping it will change. President Trump, leadership is about adjusting and being able to change your mind when circumstances war-rant it. I am not saying we need to be in Syria forever. I am saying now is not the time to leave, and Senator SHAHEEN made a very compelling case about conditions on the ground. The winners are Russia, Iran, ISIS, and Assad. The losers are the Kurdish people, who came to our aid when al-most nobody would. The Arabs who are part of the Syrian Democratic Forces are big-time losers. I can only imagine what it is like tonight in Manbij. I saw in the eyes of the people that we were partnered with, hope and trust: America is here. America is good. Maybe our suffering is over. When I look at the flag and the sol-diers who wear it on their sleeve, we are not a perfect country, but we are a damn good country. What makes us a good people is that we do the hard things. We are not the policemen of the world. I understand that, but we are the glue that holds this world together. We have betrayed our Kurdish allies if this decision stands. If it is reversed, I will be the first one to applaud the President because that is true leader-ship. To those who say that we have de-feated ISIS in Syria, that is an inac-curate statement. They have been hurt. They have been degraded. I give the President all the credit in the world for changing our policies re-garding the fight against ISIS, but I will not buy into the narrative that they have been defeated in Syria and Iraq. I just got back from Afghanistan and haven’t slept in 2 days. I really appre-ciate the chance to visit our troops and talk to our generals, but, sure as hell, ISIS is not defeated in Afghanistan. So to say they are defeated is an over-statement, and it is fake news. It is not true. They have been severely dam-aged, but they will come back unless we are there to stop it. I don’t intend to outsource our na-tional security to any foreign power. This idea that Turkey is going to be the good guy, that Turkey is going to come into Syria and protect us against the rise of ISIS, is just crazy. What Turkey is going to do is unleash holy hell on the Kurds. In the eyes of Tur-key, they are more of a threat than ISIS. This decision is a disaster on mul-tiple fronts, and I hope it can be changed. There is a resolution urging the President to make a withdrawal de-cision based on conditions on the ground after a vigorous interagency process. Mr. President, I, too, want our troops to come home, but I don’t want to tell the American people that we are secure when I don’t believe we are. And what is odd is that the troops who are actu-ally doing the fighting believe in this more than anybody. They were proud to be partners with the Kurds. Most of them had been to Iraq and Afghanistan numerous times and were heartbroken when we left Iraq and all of the gains lost. Many of them went back to the fight to take it yet again. So to the body who loves the troops, that is good. The American people re-spect our troops. If you truly love them, let them win. They are not ask-ing to come home. They do this volun-tarily. They understand why they are there. They understand the benefits of being there. I know it must be tough as Com-mander in Chief to write a letter to the family of the fallen. I know it is a hard decision for any President to make to put people in harm’s way, but I just want the President to understand that the troops who do this embrace their mission and believe they are defending their Nation and protecting their fami-lies. They accept the risk. If we do fol-low through with this withdrawal, I am afraid Americans all over the world and here at home are going to be more at risk, not less. I can’t imagine winning this war without allies. If this decision stands, I can’t imagine being able to sign up many people in the future to serve with us to defeat enemies that threaten us after today. What hurts so much is to have been on the ground—to see it get bad, to see it get better—and to look into the eyes of the people who are willing to fight with us and see the hope they have that we are finally here. It hurts so much to know that every-body that we talked to in Manbij— many of them—are going to get killed. They did the honorable thing to come to our aid, to help destroy a common enemy of mankind, ISIS. We have been dishonorable. This is a stain on the honor of the United States. I hope and pray the President will re-consider this. I know that every Na-tional Security Advisor understands that the time is not right to withdraw, that the situation described by Senator S
HAHEEN as to what will happen is more likely than not. If he does not decide to reconsider, then it will be incumbent upon the Congress to speak and hold him ac-countable. If you are concerned about today’s decision as a Member of the Senate, please join this resolution. It is

very evenly worded. We all want the troops to come home, but we want to make sure they come home with honor and that the conditions warrant them leaving. Right now, we are withdrawing in a dishonorable fashion. We are putting our own Nation more at risk. Just as sure as I am on the floor of the Senate, ISIS will reemerge, and all those who helped us are going to be in jeopardy. It will be harder to get allies in the fu-ture. As for these 700 prisoners who were captured on the battlefield, we will hear from them again. Mrs. SHAHEEN. Will my colleague yield for a question? Mr. GRAHAM. Yes. Mrs. SHAHEEN. You talk about those 700 prisoners. A number of them are foreign fighters. A number of them are ISIS fighters from Syria and Iraq. What do you think will happen to those detainees who are being held by the Syrian Democratic Forces if we with-draw and there is no support for what they are doing? Mr. GRAHAM. One of two things will happen. No. 1, the Syrian Democratic Forces had a very ethical view of treat-ing prisoners. I was astonished at the compliance with law and their desire to take their enemies and treat them bet-ter than they were treated. The jail was, quite frankly, very impressive. Here is what is going to happen. They are going to shoot them or they are going to get out. If Assad takes over before Turkey gets there, they will kill everybody in the jail. So what does it matter if a bunch of ISIS fighters get killed? It is about us. Once they are captured, it matters how we treat them. I want them tried. I want them held off the battlefield. We are not exe-cutioners. But the most likely scenario is that ISIS reemerges and they break out. I promise the President this—and I told President Obama the same thing— if you will stick with it and listen to the generals, no matter whether it hurts me or not, we will be with you. We will give you the political support a Republican can give a Democrat to see this thing through. I promise the Presi-dent one thing: I will help you where I can, but I am going to hold you ac-countable. I am going to do everything in my power—if you don’t change this decision—to make sure you own it, so the next President will learn from your mistakes. I yield. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

FUNDING THE GOVERNMENT Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today we will pass a third continuing resolution, CR, to keep the government operating through February 8. I support this CR because a government shutdown is never good for our country—in fact, it is a terrible idea—but this whole proc-ess has been a missed opportunity. For six of the seven appropriations bills covered under today’s CR, we have a clear path forward. These bills—Agri-culture, Commerce-Justice-Science, In-terior, Financial Services, Transpor-tation-Housing and Urban Develop-ment, and the State-Foreign Oper-ations bill—could be done by close of business today if there was the will. They are largely finished, are the prod-uct of bipartisan compromise, and pro-vide the funds necessary to address critical needs of the American people and to protect U.S. national security. Unfortunately, the President held them hostage for $5 billion to try to wall off our southern border, a wall he promised American taxpayers that Mexico would pay for. What will be lost because of the President’s intransigence? These six bills provide much-needed funding to help combat our Nation’s opioid epidemic and critical invest-ments in infrastructure to help rebuild our Nation’s crumbling roads, bridges, and highways. They provide resources to protect the environment and help ensure that the water we drink and the air we breathe is safe and clean for this generation and the next. They provide important assistance for our Nation’s farmers and rural com-munities who have been particularly hurt this year by the President’s trade policies, and they support key allies and national security programs that are what enable the United States to be a global leader, a role that is being increasingly challenged by China and Russia. Unfortunately, this much-needed as-sistance is put on hold because the President held out for $5 billion for his wall, at the exorbitant cost of $31 mil-lion per mile, straight from the Amer-ican taxpayer’s pocket. We also should be passing a disaster package to help families and commu-nities devastated by Hurricanes Maria, Florence, and Michael, the Hawaii vol-canoes, California wildfires, and Alas-ka earthquakes. We should remember that no one in this Chamber is immune from disaster. Seven years ago, Trop-ical Storm Irene devastated my home State of Vermont. Marcelle and I ob-served the wreckage from that storm in Vermont—large parts of commu-nities washed away, homes and farms demolished, local landmarks and bridges destroyed. Republicans and Democrats in the Senate, from across the country, stood by Vermont’s side then to help us rebuild because that is who we are as Americans. This year, the images of flattened homes, buckled pavement, and raging flames have been matched in horror only by the devastated lives they have left in their wake. Florida, North Caro-lina, South Carolina, Alabama, Geor-gia, California, Hawaii, and Alaska, they all need our help, and it is inde-fensible that, because of the Presi-dent’s obsession with one issue, his wall, we are punting this disaster fund-ing until the new year. These commu-nities need to know their government stands behind them in times of crisis. Why didn’t we get this done? Why can’t we pass the six bills that are fin-ished and a disaster package to help those communities in need before we adjourn? There is one clear answer to that question: President Donald J. Trump. He has held all of our good work, by Democrats and Republicans, hostage over $5 billion for his mis-guided wall along the southern border. It is a travesty. My opposition to his border wall, a wall he over and over pledged to the American people that Mexico would pay for, has been clear from the start. The United States is a country founded by immigrants, and walling ourselves off from our neighbors to the south is not only impossible and an expensive waste of American taxpayer dollars, it is immoral, ineffective, and an affront to everything this country stands for. Everyone agrees that we need to keep our border safe and secure, but there are better and smarter ways to accom-plish that than building a 30-foot high concrete barrier between us and Mex-ico. Let’s not be fooled by recent White House rhetoric that President Trump was backing down from his demands on the wall. The price demanded by the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S7899 December 19, 2018 
White House for letting the rest of these bills advance without $5 billion for the wall was a $1 billion slush fund to fuel the President’s extreme, anti- immigrant agenda. Why should we give a blank check to a President who has shown, time and time again, that he is more interested in vilifying immi-grants than he is in solving our immi-gration problems? His immigration policies have already caused immeas-urable human suffering along our southern border and tarnished our rep-utation around the world. Providing his administration with an additional $1 billion slush fund to enact this agen-da is a nonstarter. The fact is the President’s wall does not have the votes to get through the House or Senate, and he is in no posi-tion to practice horse-trading of one untenable, unpopular, wasteful policy for another, nor will Congress stand by and watch the President take funds from our men and women in the mili-tary or their families in order to pay for the wall. This fight will continue into the next Congress, but I do not an-ticipate those basic facts will change. It is long past time for President Trump to recognize that we live in a democracy. We have three coequal branches of government. Governing ef-fectively is not about making threats and false promises. Campaign slogans are no substitute for practical, afford-able solutions. I want to thank Chairman S
HELBY for his steadfast partnership this year as we tried to get the appropriations proc-ess back on track. I know that he shares my disappointment that we were not able to complete our work, but I am proud of what we have accom-plished this year. By working together across party lines, we moved all 12 bills out of the committee on strong bipar-tisan votes. We advanced 9 of the 12 bills through the Senate, also with strong bipartisan votes, and we were able to enact 5 of the 12 appropriations bills on time for the first time in dec-ades. I also thank Chairman S
HELBY ’Sstaff and my staff for their hard work, ex-pertise, and their commitment to ac-complishing our goals this year. I ask unanimous consent to print a list of the bipartisan committee staff in the R
ECORD . I look forward to work-ing with him and his staff, and our col-leagues in the House, in the next Con-gress to finish our work. There being no objection, the mate-rial was ordered to be printed in the R

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES7900 December 19, 2018 
trying for many weeks, through the chairman of that committee and her staff, to get language or to at least get an outline of this. We were not able to get that until today at 10 a.m. Even after we got that, we asked for at least an outline of this bill or for a summary of the bill text from the committee staff, from the chairman’s staff. They didn’t respond to us. They wouldn’t give it to us, just as they haven’t for weeks. We got this—the closest thing to a summary—from a lobbyist. We had to wait to get it from a lobbyist. This is of great impact to my State. This bill creates 1.3 million acres of wilderness, about half of which is in my State. This bill permanently reau-thorizes the Land and Water Conserva-tion Fund, which is an entity that has been used to acquire more Federal land. Now, in coming from a State where two-thirds of the land is owned by the Federal Government—where we can’t do anything without leave from the Federal Government—this hurts. In coming from a State where we have had about 2 million acres of Federal land declared as monuments through Presidential proclamations, this hurts. I have made what I consider to be a very reasonable offer, and I ask that it be accepted. It involves two words. I want the inclusion of two words in this bill—two words. Add the words ‘‘or Utah’’ to some language in the Antiq-uities Act. I have an amendment that I will counteroffer. I will accept this bill and agree to its passage if these two words are added to the Antiquities Act, the words ‘‘or Utah.’’ I ask that my col-leagues accept this. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator so modify the request? The Senator from Alaska. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I think it is important to recognize that while the text, in fairness to my friend from Utah, was just laid down this morning, these are bills, these are measures, these are matters that have not only been before our committee but have been before the subcommittee on which the Senator is the chairman, and he has had an opportunity to have heard many of those public lands bills. This was a very highly negotiated process by the four corners—not only by Senator C
ANTWELL and me on this side but by our colleagues on the House side—to see what could be put together by way of a package, in terms of the contours of that package. Colleagues will remember that around this body, unfortunately, when it comes to public lands matters, many of these are very, very parochial in na-ture. Whether it is a conveyance that allows for a water utility to be able to proceed or whether it is a conveyance that will allow for a school to have a facility there, it is pretty parochial. These don’t come to the floor for de-bate and passage. Typically and traditionally, what happens is—and it might not be a per-fect process—we bundle them up at the end of the year. What we have done is to have provided—and not only to members of the committee—the bills that we have had an opportunity to have heard. We have outlined what that universe is. In fairness to my col-league and his comment, it was not until the very end that we knew ex-actly what was going to fall in based on the negotiations with our House col-leagues and with our colleagues on the other side of the aisle. Yet what I would offer up to Mem-bers is that this has been an extraor-dinarily collaborative process in terms of those priorities that we see rep-resented within this bill. Just on our side of the aisle alone, there are some 43 Members who either have bills that they have authored or are the cospon-sors of with regard to matters that are important to their States and matters that are, perhaps, more globally impor-tant, like the LWCF, and I understand the Senator’s position on the LWCF. We also recognize that there are a great number of Members on the Re-publican side and on the Democratic side who are very supportive of some form of reauthorization of the LWCF. We have a sportsman package in here that many, many of us have been work-ing on. In fact, this is the fourth Con-gress now in which we have tried to ad-vance these priorities for many of the sports men and women in the country. So we have attempted to work through some of the issues that my colleague from Utah has raised. We have offered to withdraw very sig-nificant legislation that our Presiding Officer himself has offered. That is not something that I really willingly want-ed to do, but in an effort to try to get a broader lands package that would recognize the needs of so many, we made some significant offers. Now, my colleague has asked for two simple words. I happen to believe, as one who comes from a State where we have said no more to the Antiquities Act without some limitations, I under-stand the concerns, and I understand the effort that he has made repeatedly. I also understand that the politics on this side of the aisle and in the other body are such that it was not an ac-ceptable offer or an acceptable amend-ment. So we are where we are now, and I come before you to make the offer to allow us an opportunity to vote on this lands package, to move it over to the House, and to finish this off. I under-stand that we do not have that con-sent. What we have come to this evening is a recognition that there is a desire amongst Members in this body to see this package through. The leader has committed and the minority leader has committed that when we return in January, this will be—if not the first order of business—a matter that will be before this body within the first couple of weeks. We will turn to it, and it will be a package that we will not have begun all over, but it will be something that Members can look to tonight. This will be an opportunity to study every single page that you want because we will have an opportunity to vote on that with a thumbs up or a thumbs down in early January when we return. Again, this is something that I wish we had been able to resolve. In fairness, I wish that we would have been able to have provided for there to have been a greater opportunity for Members to have reviewed this before these final hours. In fairness, this is just Wednes-day night. We will now continue until after the new year. We probably could have had another couple of days to have worked on it, but that didn’t work in our favor, and I regret that. I thank those who have worked dog-gedly on both sides to try to come to an agreement so that we could resolve this finally and fully. So many of these issues are so important to people back in their counties and their municipali-ties and their boroughs and their States. We are going to put it on hold for yet another month, but we will be back at the first of the year, and we will con-tinue to address these issues that are so important when it comes to our pub-lic lands, our waters, our conservation priorities, as well as the priorities of our sports men and women. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator modify her request? Ms. MURKOWSKI. I believe there is an objection to the request. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection to the original request from the Senator from Alaska? Mr. LEE. Yes, I object. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Utah’s objection is heard. The Senator from Utah. Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I find it un-fortunate that the addition of two words is somehow unacceptable to the Members of this body—two words. They are two words, by the way, that would put Utah in the same category as Alaska and Wyoming. What do those States have in common? They both have repeatedly been victims of the Antiquities Act. You see, in every single State from Colorado to the west of Colorado, the Federal Government owns at least 15 percent of the land. In many of those States, it is much more than 15 percent of the land. In my State, it is two- thirds of the land—about 67 percent. What that means is that we have to get permission from the Federal Govern-ment to do just about everything. What that also means is that our schools are underfunded—everything from fire, search, rescue, education, local governance. All of these budgets are underfunded as a result of the fact that most of the land is owned by the Federal Government. We can’t tax that land. We receive pennies on the dollar for a program called payment in lieu of taxes. It is pennies on the dollar be-cause most of our land is not ours. Most of our land cannot be developed privately. Most of our land cannot be taxed by the States and localities,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S7901 December 19, 2018 
which makes it harder for us to edu-cate our children, for us to secure our streets, for us to put out fires—fires, by the way, that become far more severe because of extensive Federal land-ownership, which is plainly excessive, which is plainly unfair, which kills people and results in devastating losses not only to property but also to the health of the environment. Bad Federal land management policy is at the root of this. Do you know what is interesting? People like to talk a lot about these wildfires. A lot of them occur in the West. Why? Well, there is a lot of Federal public land in the West. Yes, there are parts of the country where they have forests where these things don’t happen, and when they do, they are put out much faster in things called private forests. Pri-vately owned forests and forests owned by many States are much less prone to wildfires, and when they do occur, they put them out more quickly. Why? Be-cause they are not hobbled under a mountain of regulations that makes it almost impossible for us to prevent them and then from putting them out quickly. This is devastating to our States. It is a burden on our States and on our State in particular. Many of you, if you live east of the Rocky Mountains, come from lands where Federal public lands are almost unheard of, where they are rare, where you have private land left and right. A lot of those same States used to be mostly Federal. A State like Illinois used to be overwhelmingly Federal. Many, if not most, of the States have added, since the Louisiana Purchase, language in their enabling legislation, anticipating that, in time, Federal pub-lic land within a State’s boundaries would be sold and that in the case of my State and that of many other States, a percentage of the proceeds from the sale of that land would be put into a trust fund for the benefit of the States’ public education systems. Those promises were honored in the Dakotas and in States like Indiana and Illinois. They were honored as we ex-panded westward. For some reason, when we got to the Rocky Mountains, they stopped honoring them. There are a lot of reasons for this. Some of it has to do with what we were occupied with doing as a country at the time. Some of it has to do with the fact that our land is what was regarded as rugged and perhaps undesirable for a time. But the understanding was still there, just as it was the understanding in the Da-kotas and in States like Indiana and Il-linois. The effects are still there. We are still impoverished. Our ability to ex-pand economically is impaired, and the health of our environment is signifi-cantly degraded as a result of this ex-cessive, unnecessary Federal land-ownership. Now, make no mistake—I am not talking here about national parks. Peo-ple like to caricature those who com-plain about excessive Federal land-ownership and suggest—as if we are going to put oil drilling rigs under-neath Delicate Arch and other national treasures. That is not what we are talking about at all. I am talking about garden variety, Federal public land—land that is excessively re-stricted and that is environmentally degraded as a result of poor Federal land management policies. Why? Well, because these decisions are made by Federal landing managers who live and work and make decisions many hun-dreds and in many cases many thou-sands of miles from those most affected by those decisions. How, then, does this relate to the An-tiquities Act? Well, a State like mine that has a lot of Federal public land, like Alaska and Wyoming do, is par-ticularly, uniquely vulnerable to pred-atory practices under the Antiquities Act, allowing the President of the United States, under a law passed over a century ago, to utilize his discretion to set aside land as a national monu-ment. It is already Federal; this is put-ting it into a new classification—a classification subject to even more re-strictions, eligible for even less devel-opment, less human activity, less ac-cess for recreational or agricultural or religious or cultural purposes. When you put it in that category, it makes it even more difficult for those people surrounding it, those people living in and around the Federal public lands in question. So Utah, like Wyoming and Alaska, has had a whole lot of Presidents de-clare a whole lot of Federal public land, national monument land. Now, fortunately for the States of Alaska and Wyoming, they have had congressional delegations that in the past have said, no more, have de-manded relief, and have said that they have had enough. In the case of a State like mine that has had a couple of mil-lion acres, roughly, of Federal public land declared monument by a Presi-dential proclamation, this is impor-tant. If it is good enough for Alaska, if it is good enough for Wyoming, why not extend the same courtesy to the State of Utah? Why, when a bill is 680 pages long— which I received at 10 a.m. today, on what may well be the last or penul-timate day of this legislative session of this Congress—why are we receiving this just now, especially in the Senate during a term of Congress when it was originally believed that we might be adjourning by December 6 or 7 or 13 or 14? Here it is on December 19—my daugh-ter’s 18th birthday, by the way; happy birthday, Eliza—December 19, and we are just getting this bill for the first time today. What does that mean? If we had adjourned when we were originally thinking we might adjourn, would this never have happened? It has been suggested to us by some Members and some staff that had we adjourned earlier, this would have just been re-leased perhaps on the last day of the session. I can’t get into anyone else’s head. I can’t peer into anyone else’s subjective intentions. But this makes me kind of nervous, the fact that, yes, I sit on the committee from whence this bill origi-nated, and, yes, I chair the Public Lands Subcommittee, yet there are a whole lot of these that the chairman or the ranking member know darn well that I oppose, that I voted against in committee, and there are other provi-sions that they know I have had long-standing concerns with. I wonder if maybe, just maybe, that is part of the reason they wouldn’t tell me what was in it. I understand it is difficult negoti-ating a big piece of legislation. I sym-pathize greatly with that. I am not suggesting that short of receiving the entire 680-page document exactly as it has been submitted, I would irrev-ocably have bound myself to voting against it. I am not suggesting that at all. It would have been nice to have a roadmap, to have some clue as to what might have been in there. And I know from conversations I have since had with Members today that they have known for weeks, if not months, that they were putting permanent LWCF re-authorization in this bill. I don’t believe it was a coincidence that I wasn’t informed of this. I don’t believe it was a coincidence that even after this bill was released at 10 a.m. today, the staff of the committee re-fused even to give me an outline—an outline—of what was in the bill, even after they had filed it. We had to get this from a lobbyist. This is wrong. It is wrong that the State of Utah is treated the way it is. It is wrong that you wouldn’t give us that language. It is wrong that you won’t treat us the same way Alaska and Wyoming are treated. This is wrong. We can do better. I im-plore my colleagues to make this sim-ple change. Two words. Two words. Add the words ‘‘for Utah’’ to this bill, and I will wholeheartedly support it. If not, I will continue to oppose it. Thank you. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Colorado. Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, as my colleague from Utah knows, we offered the chance to vote on those two words tonight. The two words that he is ask-ing for tonight we offered a chance to vote on. Mr. LEE. Will the Senator yield? Mr. GARDNER. Let me talk about this because I am pretty doggone upset because the people of Colorado to-night—who are worried about whether they can protect themselves from fire— lost the Wildfire Technology Act in this bill. That was in this bill—a bill that our committee heard, that our committee voted on, that it voted on with bipartisan support, probably unanimously. That was in this bill to protect our communities from wildfire and to protect our firefighters from in-jury—in this bill. The other thing in this bill is Minturn, CO, which has a water system

over a wilderness area and which for years has been trying to fix it. They can’t because it is in a wilderness area. So we have to have an act of Congress to allow the city to fix their water sys-tem. Rejected tonight because we weren’t allowed to vote on it tonight. Mr. LEE. Do the people of Colorado care that you were— Mr. GARDNER. And you bet the per-manent Land and Water Conservation Fund is in here tonight because, guess what, it has the majority support of this body. If we had a vote on it to-night, it would have passed. Repub-licans and Democrats would have voted yes. It would have passed. Not only that, we have boundary ad-justments in here because people died, and they wanted to give it to the na-tional monument. That is not con-troversial. Somebody wanted to do the right thing, and doggone it, we can’t even vote on it here. I give compliments to the chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee who struck a deal. Yes, it was yesterday. We got the bill as fast as we could. And so many of these dog-gone pieces of legislation we have al-ready heard. We had committee hear-ings on them, and we voted them out unanimously. Bipartisan support. We offered deal after deal after deal to try to get a deal arranged and made so that we could have a vote tonight. Go tell the people of Minturn, CO, that they don’t have a water system that they can fix because Congress has decided we are not going to allow that to come to a vote. Sportsmen back home—tell them we are not going to have a sportsmen’s package because we decided not to bring a bipartisan bill to the floor for a vote. When we come back to this body next year, we have an agreement—I believe that is correct; and I will defer to the chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee—that this will be one of the first actions this Chamber addresses. When that happens, there will be a chance to file cloture, there will be a chance for open debate, and we will have that vote. We will have it next year. There will be different lead-ership in the Senate, so different nego-tiations will have to take place, but I have no doubt that we will get this done. It is frustrating to me that some of these bills have languished for year after year after year after year that re-ceived unanimous support out of com-mittee. I remember coming to this floor a year ago offering a unanimous consent agreement. It was objected to because somebody didn’t get what they wanted, somebody else didn’t get what they wanted, and somebody else didn’t get what they wanted, so everything was objected to. It created a whole domino effect, so they said just wait for the lands package. So here we are waiting for the lands package. We had a chance to do it. And we tried and tried and tried to make offer after offer to get something agreed to. I have great respect for my colleague from Utah. We are a public lands State too. Yes, our agencies need to make better decisions about how they con-serve that public land. The people of Colorado have great support for the Land and Water Conservation Fund. Great support. They would like to see it made permanent. I would like to see it made permanent. My guess is, next year, it will be made permanent. Why can’t we have a vote tonight? Why can’t we have people who don’t like it vote no and people who do like it vote yes? There is plenty of oppor-tunity to do that tonight. The people of Colorado expect this place to get its work done. The bills we have had have been through, nego-tiated in the House and Senate, many out of the committee with bipartisan support, if not unanimous. I guess the folks in Minturn will just have to wait one more Congress to get their water system fixed because this body couldn’t agree to allow a vote. We wonder why people are sick of this place. It is be-cause of that. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Utah. Mr. LEE. Mr. President, all I am ask-ing is for the language that I have asked for—two words, the words ‘‘for Utah’’—to be added to this legislation. I am asking to be treated on equal footing as the language proposed by the Senator from Colorado, the Sen-ator from Alaska, the Senator from Washington, the Senator from Mon-tana, and others—equal footing. We have equal representation in the Senate. It is the one type of constitu-tional amendment that is preemptively unconstitutional. You can’t modify the equal representation of the Senate. That is what makes this place unique. Each State is represented equally, and I will defend my State, the State of Utah, to my dying breath. As long as I am here breathing and holding an elec-tion certificate, I will defend it. My distinguished friend and col-league, for whom I have great affection and respect, has just pointed out that the people of Colorado might be dis-appointed about this water measure that was in there or this or that other provision for Colorado. Do they have reason to be concerned? You bet. Do those people in Colorado have objec-tion to the idea that Utah might be treated equally with Alaska or Wyo-ming? I think not. I think most people in America would look at a State that has had a couple of million acres of monument declared and that just wants to be treated the same way as Alaska and Wyoming and say that is not unreasonable. This is a sovereign State, one that has been mistreated by Federal land managers. We don’t want to continue doing that. This is a generous offer. It is a reasonable offer. As to the suggestion that because it was offered that this receive a separate vote—and it is really not equivalent at all. What he is saying is, split this out; everything else sinks or swims to-gether. All of theirs pass, and ours stands alone. If we are going to consoli-date this many bills at once—and he is right: Some of these passed out unani-mously, and a bunch of them didn’t. I voted against a number of them. Some of them are new. Some are old but have been modified. One provision involving my own State involved 450,000 or 500,000 acres of wilderness and has, since it moved through the committee, been modified to include an additional 200,000 acres of wilderness. That is from my State, and I sit on the committee, and I chair the subcommittee that is supposed to review these things, and this is the first I have seen of them. So, yes, I say to my distinguished friend and colleague, for whom I also have great respect and admiration and affection, yes, there are a lot of paro-chial matters that are addressed in these public lands bills, and appro-priately so. What I am asking is for my State to be treated like your State. That is all I am asking. It is not unrea-sonable. It is not unfair. So if you are going to have 640 pages’ worth of legislation, including some legislation that has some significant ramifications for my State, I ask you to put those two words into the bill. That is not unreasonable. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Washington. Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I come first and foremost tonight to thank the staff who worked so hard on this package—and I mean not just over the last few weeks but for literally years—to try to get to an agreement on something we could vote on. It is not a surprise to the Senate that it is December and people are voting on a lands package. My colleague from Colorado outlined it very well. When you have these bills that deal with water, that deal with public lands, that deal with giving Federal land back to communities so they can improve their communities, and yet designating some special places so they can be preserved for the public, yes, not all of your col-leagues care about the details of that, and you are never going to get the leader, who is in control of the Senate, to give you floor time on that bill. So every December, we are here with a lands package to be considered, and it is a package that has a lot of input from a lot of people, negotiated, in this case, with the House and the Senate, with Democrats and Republicans—a four-corner negotiation. The missed opportunity tonight, as my colleague from Colorado said, is that we don’t get to vote on it. My col-league from Utah is not being correct in that he was offered a chance to have that vote. He was offered a chance to have this bill brought up and to have his ideas voted on. He knew he was going to lose, and he knows he is going to lose in January, but he wants to in-sist tonight on prevailing. I am not

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S7903 December 19, 2018 
sure why, because, as my colleague from Colorado said, why continue to hold up these small communities from getting the resources they need? Trust me, communities like Yakima, WA, want answers to the challenges of changing conditions that impact water and the fact that fish and farmers and Tribes and environmentalists all have to get together to solve those prob-lems. So they worked for years on com-ing up with a solution collectively at the local community and then put that before the U.S. Senate for a hearing and for consideration, and that pro-posal passed the U.S. Senate, I think, in an 85-to-12 vote 2 years ago, as did permanent reauthorization of the Land and Water Conservation Fund, 2 years ago, which passed the U.S. Senate. So if my colleague from Utah is imagining that somehow the Land and Water Conservation Fund being made permanent is not going to pass the U.S. Senate, he is just dreaming of some-thing that is really going to take place and become reality in the very near fu-ture. But what you have done tonight is made it a lot harder for us to make sure that we are moving ahead. This legislation that he refused to allow us to vote on tonight also in-cludes important—I would say one thing. The one thing that maybe you could say hasn’t had constant, con-stant attention over 2 years but cer-tainly has grown in importance is new technology to help our firefighters fight fires, locate where the fire is hap-pening, and GPS systems to help make people more safe. That was in this package and probably, yes, has gotten enhanced a great deal over the last 6 months as we have seen the tragic, dev-astating impacts of fires throughout the West. So, yes, that was in here and it was part of consideration, and, yes, there was legislative action. Ninety percent of this package either saw leg-islation passed by the House of Rep-resentatives or passed by the Senate— legislation that basically passed out of either a Senate committee or a House committee. So it is not like these ideas came out of nowhere. They are, as my colleague from Colorado said best, parochial issues that we find very hard to get the rest of our colleagues to ever want to pay attention to the details. So this has been the tried and true fashion by which the Senate has passed land packages, as long as I have been here, for 18 years. That is what you do in December. You pass a lands package. I wish it were different. My colleague from Colorado made a good suggestion about 7 or 8 months ago: Why don’t we do some right now? Thanks to his initiative, we actually bundled together 15 or 20. But he was right. Guess what. Everybody said: Where is mine? Where is my package? Where is this? I am not going to let you do this, and we were in the same boat. So the best answer to all of that is that in December we will do a lands package. The notion that people didn’t know this was coming is a little bit face-tious. Everybody has known that this is the time, and these are the packages and these are the proposals. To my colleague from Utah, I get it. He is not necessarily in agreement with some of his own delegation who pushed things for Utah that are in this package. I get it. He has a different philosophy about what should happen. I guarantee you that Utah is going to have a lot more debates about what it wants to see for its future, and I think that is ultimately healthy. I can just answer for my State, which has three National Parks and generates millions of dollars from them. I can just answer for my State, which thinks that the outdoor economy is the No. 1 reason we attract and keep high-skilled and unbe-lievable manufacturing jobs in the Pa-cific Northwest. Why? Because busi-nesses want to locate there because their workers want to have access to that. My State knows that the outdoor economy—because it has companies like REI—is over $800 billion of annual economy. So, yes, when you invest in public lands, you get more access for hunters and fishers and people who want to go and enjoy and recreate, and for our veterans. So guess what. It is a great economic development tool. The notion that a State that has pub-lic lands doesn’t have economic oppor-tunity is not telling the whole story. We all get it. We all represent counties that have nothing but an outdoor econ-omy or public land, and then they want to know how to build a school or a fire station or keep the lights on for basic services. We get that complexity too. But our colleagues did consider these ideas, and our colleagues did consider the notion that there are diverse opin-ions. It is just that, at the end of the day, you have to have a vote. You have to be able to come here to the Senate on this subject—that is, lands pack-ages—and have a process. Listen, if my colleagues who care so much about this want to create a new norm in the Senate that the first week of December will be the deadline for all lands packages, and then by the end of that session we will have lands pack-ages always considered in the Senate, I am all for it. I am all for that right now, because I see devastation hap-pening on water writ large. I see unbe-lievable problems happening through-out the West just on water. Now, you can say we are going to do nothing and we are just going to let the courts and the lawsuits and every-thing play out. But guess what. That is where we were on fire, until what hap-pened? Until the Senators from Mon-tana and the Senators from Idaho and the Senators from Oregon and the Sen-ators from Washington all got together on a fire bill and we said: This is what we think would be great for the West to do to move forward. That is what we were trying to do tonight on water, on other fire measures, and on public lands, and helping veterans and Native Americans in Alaska who never got a fair deal on access to their own land. So I get that these solutions may take a few pages to print out and for people to read, but they are important public policies that need to have this body’s attention, and you are doing nothing but shortchanging the public debate if you will not even allow the bill to come to the floor for that de-bate. We are always, always going to get sidelined as individual bills, not being important enough to take up the time of the Senate. It is only collectively, in a bundle like we saw tonight, that they can be considered. But I guarantee you—I guarantee you—that they are not going to grow into a package that becomes less important with time. They are just not. They are just not. They are going to continue to be am-plified as important public policies, where a local government—a county or a city—and the Forest Service and BLM and a school district and a com-munity are going to have to work to-gether. They are going to have to work together. They are going to have to work together on water, on fire, on public access, on conveyance, on how we are going to preserve open space, on how we are going to recreate. It is going to be demanded. I know my colleague from Utah doesn’t agree with all these philoso-phies, but I guarantee you that there are lots of people in Utah who would have loved to have a vote tonight to see how those issues would have played out. I just want to thank staff. They have worked night and day, literally—lit-erally for months, if not years—on these policies. They have worked so hard to try to find the common good and a place to move forward, and I so appreciate that our leaders are now committing to us to help move this for-ward in January. We are definitely going to take them up on it. Even though it will be a new Congress and a new House of Representatives, we are going to take it up, and I am sure that our colleagues, Congressman G
RIJALVA  and Congressman B
ISHOP , will be there to work with us. There will never be an easy day to vote on public lands—never. It is just never going to happen. So we had bet-ter own up to the responsibility and get the commitment to these cities and communities that need us to help them hold Federal Agencies accountable, to make the investments our constituents want to see, and to solve these prob-lems so our communities can continue to grow and thrive. I believe these people are bubbling up some of the best ideas on how to move forward. That is what they did in var-ious parts of the West. Whether that was in Montana with what to do at Yel-lowstone, or whether that was in Alas-ka with what to do with the Native issue, or Yakima on what to do with water, they are bubbling up the ideas. At least what we can do is give them

the courtesy of having a vote so that they can be considered. I thank the President. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Alaska. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I know my colleague from Montana wishes to speak, But before the Sen-ator from Washington departs, I also want to acknowledge the good work of both of our staffs—and not just our staffs, but working with our colleagues on the House side and with so many Members. When you are going through the vol-ume that we are talking about—some 114 different bills on the House side and the Senate side—it is extraordinarily tedious and difficult work, and I think we owe them all a great deal of thanks. But I also want to rise and thank Sen-ator C
ANTWELL , because in this next Congress she will be moving to another position as ranking member and I will not be working side-by-side with her as we have. I think it is important to note that on the difficult things that came before us, we didn’t always start off in agree-ment, but we slogged through it and our teams stuck with it and slogged through it, and we got to where we are tonight. While it is not a good ending from my view, in that we weren’t able to provide these counties, these com-munities, these people that have worked so hard the satisfaction they are seeking, the commitment to con-tinue this until we are done is real, it is in place, it is intact, and it was agreed to tonight, and we are going to be moving forward in the first few weeks of January. I want to thank Senator C
ANTWELL  for the working relationship we have had over these past couple of years moving through important matters for your State, for my State, and really for the good of the country when it comes to energy. So I just appreciate your courtesies and our opportunity to work together and that of our staffs. Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I just want to thank the Senator from Alaska for her great work and working in such a collaborative way. I am cer-tainly not leaving the Energy Com-mittee and certainly not going to back away from any of these big issues, but certainly, as she said, I will not be working as closely as the ranking member with her as chair. But I am certainly and definitely going to con-tinue to work in a collaborative way. So I thank her for her kind com-ments and look forward to what we can do in the new year. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Montana. Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I want to share some comments on what we saw happen here tonight as it relates to the public lands package. We saw a glimpse here tonight of, on the one hand, how this institution can really come together—years of bipartisan work, years of collaboration on the ground back in our respective States— and come together to put together a lands package and ask for a simple up- or-down vote tonight in the Senate. I am very confident that had we had the opportunity to have voted here to-night, you would have seen this lands package pass the Senate by at least a 2-to-1 margin. It would have gone to the House, and it would have passed. It would have gone to President Trump’s desk, and I am confident he would have signed it. We have been fighting for permanent reauthorization of the Land and Water Conservation Fund because of what happened right here tonight—the un-certainty of this institution, where 98 Senators can say ‘‘Let’s move ahead for a vote’’; 2 Senators say no, and we weren’t able to have a vote tonight. It is OK to oppose legislation. That is the American process—for each of us to come down here and express our respec-tive opinions. Some will say yes; some will say no. What we were asking for here tonight is to have that debate on the floor. Let’s have that vote on the floor, and let the Senators respectively speak on behalf of the people who sent them here in the first place to rep-resent their interests. The Land and Water Conservation Fund—the reason we need to perma-nently reauthorize it is that tonight you could see that we didn’t get it done. In fact, it expired on September 30, and here we are, halfway through December, and we still do not have the reauthorization of LWCF. That is why we need to make it permanent; you can’t depend on this institution. So often, for the transaction required back in our home States, where we use LWCF funds to access our public lands with a checkerboard-nature ownership structure of many, many places out West, it takes years to put together these deals—private landowners, the State, the Federal Government coming together. When the Federal Govern-ment—the U.S. Congress—can’t get its job done, it creates uncertainty. Con-sequently, who loses when there is un-certainty? The American people lose. That is why we need to permanently reauthorize it. It actually creates more certainty in taking care of a lot of these complex land issues out West, and it saves taxpayers’ dollars. By the way, as Senator B
URRhas said over and over again, LWCF doesn’t cost the taxpayer anything. It doesn’t cost the taxpayer anything. That was in this bill tonight to per-manently reauthorize it. It didn’t get done. As you read through the titles of these various bills, you hear the sto-ries. There may be what looks like one little line item here in section 1009, S. 1219. There is some little obscure title that a guy from Montana has no idea what is going on in Louisiana or Ten-nessee or Alaska or Colorado, but I know back in those respective commu-nities, there is a lot of hard work bringing people together, collaboratives to come together to put together a bill that we then bring to Congress. We move it through commit-tees. We have hours of hearings. Lit-erally, there are probably 100 years of effort at least that have gone into this legislation tonight that we were not able to have an up-or-down vote on. Wildfire Technology Modernization, the Yellowstone Gateway Protection Act—those are important to me in Montana. I will tell you what. The peo-ple who are closest to the lands ought to have the loudest voice, and I can tell you, the people in Paradise Valley, south of Livingston, MT, don’t want to see a large money operation near Chico, MT. It is time to withdraw the rights there and allow that backdoor to Yellowstone National Park to be pro-tected in perpetuity. That was part of this land package tonight. If you take a look at the Sportsmen’s Access to Federal Lands, one of the issues that sets our Nation apart is our public lands. I tell you what, if you go to Europe, you don’t see public lands. If you go virtually anywhere else in the world, you don’t see public lands. It is a unique American experience that a mom and dad in Montana, a grandma and grandpa, an aunt and uncle can still go down to Walmart and buy an elk tag and jump in the pickup, and within 20 to 30 minutes be in elk coun-try on public lands. That was part of the Sportsmen’s Access package. We had the Open Book on Equal Ac-cess to Justice Act. In fact, it is some-thing that Senator BARRASSO put in place here to ensure we have trans-parency in the way these funds are spent. There is the Migratory Bird Frame-work and Hunting Opportunities for Veterans Act in here. My point is there are over 100 bills in here with a lot of careful thought, a lot of consideration moving through com-mittees. All we wanted to do tonight is have an up-or-down vote. We didn’t get it. I am grateful that we had a good bi-partisan spirit here tonight, that we were working with leadership in both parties here in the Senate, both parties in the House, including the future lead-ership in the House. We are going to bring this bill back to the floor of the U.S. Senate in January. We are going to move this through. We are going to move it to the House. We are going to fight to get this thing on the Presi-dent’s desk and signed as one of the early acts of Congress in 2019. It didn’t end well tonight with this package, but we are going to start strong in January. We are not giving up the fight. I want to thank the staff and the committee leadership on both sides for helping us get to this point tonight. Merry Christmas and Happy New Year. We will be back in January, fighting. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. G
ARDNER ). The Senator from Kansas.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S7905 December 19, 2018 
GOVERNMENT FUNDING  
Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, a little earlier in the evening, we cast a vote, one that was done without a rollcall, and I want my constituents to know how I voted because, while I will put a statement in the R
ECORD , it will not appear as yeas and nays. Earlier this evening we passed a con-tinuing resolution, and I voted no. I want my constituents to know how I voted, and I want them to know why. I indicated to my colleagues within the last 10 days that I intend to vote no on a CR because it is not the way we should be conducting business in the U.S. Senate or in the U.S. House of Representatives. Continuing resolutions mean that we are just postponing the issues we face today, and they don’t get any easier the longer we wait to resolve them. They also mean that for the appro-priations process, of which I am a part and have spent a significant amount of time this year, while we were success-ful in many, many ways, we have left seven bills without resolution. Because we couldn’t resolve them, we are going to fund those Departments and Agen-cies at the same level of spending next year as this year. What that means is after the number of hearings we had—the witnesses who were brought in and testified, the over-sight we have done onsite at Depart-ments and Agencies and facilities across the country—we are left without that input being included in decisions. It means we are not prioritizing what spending is important. There may be a few things around here that could utilize additional re-sources. Maybe the resources level that we fund things at today is what it should be. Maybe there are things we shouldn’t fund at all, and there are cer-tainly some things which we could fund at lower levels. But no, we are not going to say that this is more impor-tant than this; we are going to say all things are equal. The way we have funded appropriations last year for these Agencies and Departments is ex-actly the right amount it should be into the future. Unfortunately, we have done CRs long enough that we are not just talk-ing about, is it right? What was right for last year is the same amount that it should be for the next several months. It goes back years. So what we are saying is that the decisions we made years ago are the same priorities we would have today. That is not true. Perhaps more compelling to me is that every time we pass a CR, we lose the opportunity to utilize the power of the purse string to rein in the behavior and actions of those who work in those Bureaus, Departments, and Agencies. If Congress is always going to give a Fed-eral Agency the same amount of money in the future as it gave in the past, there is no reason for those Agencies to pay attention to the U.S. Congress, to the House and the Senate, to article I of the U.S. Constitution, which gives the authority for appropriating money to fund the Federal Government to this Congress. We abdicate our responsibil-ities, and we reduce the opportunity on behalf of our constituents—for me, on behalf of Kansans—to make certain that the things they think are impor-tant are the things we fund, the things that are constitutional are the things we fund, and we lose the opportunity to tell an Agency by using the power of the purse string that when you pursue this regulation, when you pursue this policy, when you make the decision you make—Congress isn’t going to have the leverage on you to convince you to change your behavior. We lose the relationship that exists under the Constitution for us to have power over those Departments and Agencies in the executive branch. Common sense tells us that if we de-termine how much money an Agency or Department receives, they are going to be much more interested in what we have to say, and if they don’t listen to us, we have the ability to remove the money, to eliminate the funding. So tonight, in my view—and I believe this strongly—we missed an oppor-tunity. We have been in this process for a long time now. We set out with the goal of passing all 12 appropriations bills individually. The Appropriations Committee has done that. But they were not all brought to the Senate floor. In fact, for the bills we are talk-ing about tonight, a continuing resolu-tion was passed for them several months ago, taking us to December 8. At this point in time on December 8, we continued them until this Friday, and now, tonight, we have continued the continuing resolution with the same funding in the future as last— now for the third time in 2 months—to February 8. We are not doing what we are supposed to do, and in this process, in my view, the opportunity existed. We were very close to reaching an agreement. President Trump has strong feelings about border security. President Trump was willing to work with Congress to find a solution. Some-where along the line—and there are lots of folks who want to say where the blame lies—maybe it was with Speak-er-elect Pelosi; maybe she just is un-willing to allow anything but a con-tinuing resolution to pass. But the amount of dollars we were apart is so minimal, and the policy issues had been resolved. Yet, for some reason, we walked away. If she is the Speaker- elect of the House, I urge her to deal with this issue of appropriations. It is the power of Congress. Republicans and Democrats ought to work together to fill our constitutional responsibilities. Where are the days in which the Con-gress—Republicans and Democrats, House and Senate—exhibited their pre-rogatives, not because we want power but because the Constitution gives us the authority—the responsibility, in fact—to make decisions about spend-ing? There is no glory in making a deci-sion on spending when we say that to-day’s dollars are fine next week; they are fine the next week; they are fine the next month. We were so close to coming together this year, and it is disappointing that the end result is now a continuing resolution until Feb-ruary 8. I want my constituents to know that we have done this too many times. Yes, there may be a time in which we want to have just a few days to resolve the final differences. A few days is not Feb-ruary 8; a few days is not now, for the third time. What we needed to decide months ago, we pursued weeks later. What we should have decided weeks later, we failed to address a week ago. Tonight, we failed once again to ad-dress the issues of the proper amount of funding. Twelve appropriation bills should march their way across the U.S. Senate floor, should march their way across the House of Representatives floor, and should be sent to a President for his or her signature or his or her veto. The process that was exhibited this evening failed to allow me to have my vote recorded as it normally is, and it is important for me, for Kansans, and for Americans to know that I oppose the way we are doing business tonight. It needs to change. We have said it be-fore, and if we always say that we can wait another 2 weeks, we can wait an-other 3 weeks, we will never get back to doing the work we are hired to do by the American people. I have voted no. It is the right vote. Ms. CANTWELL. I suggest the ab-sence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

REMEMBERING JOHN JOSEPH CASSIDY Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, what can you say about a dear friend who has passed away? That he was brilliant? And supremely accomplished? That he loved family and church? And the law? And people from all walks of life? To say these things does not nearly capture the full measure of the man, the much-beloved lawyer John Cassidy, a wonderful and humble person who rose to the top of his field, who advised Washington dignitaries from Presi-dents on down, indeed so many in this body; a man who was friends to celeb-rities, business leaders, and politicians

alike, to busboys, cabbies, and store clerks as well; a man who lived life to the fullest and yet always had a kind word for whomever he encountered in the wide, wide world he so loved to ex-plore. We lost our friend John Cassidy on October 21. While some might be tempted to say at 88 years John lived a long life—his incredible vigor, his youthful enthusiasm, his passion for life, his ready smile, and the twinkle in his eye—all underscore how the world was robbed by the sudden death of John Cassidy. And so I wish to pay tribute to John Joseph Cassidy, a writer and painter, a gardener and chef, a legal scholar and mentor to decades of young students, and most of all, a devout family man whose definition of ‘‘family’’ embraced so many beyond his cherished wife Cynthia, his daughters Susan Ross Cas-sidy of Newton, MA, Carrie Elizabeth Goertz of Anchorage, AK, and Alice Madeline Meyre of Richmond, VA, and his six grandchildren John, Ned, Jen-nifer, Kate, Margaret, and Thomson. I was proud to be part of that large extended family, and I mourn his loss. Cassidy—how he invariably identified himself on the phone—was a native Washingtonian, a rarity here in the Na-tion’s Capital. John graduated from Georgetown University and then its law center and maintained a lifelong allegiance to both institutions, includ-ing service on the university’s board of directors and the law center’s board of visitors. That type of unfailing alle-giance is vintage John Cassidy, as I came to learn over the decades of our close friendship. Even as a young lawyer, Cassidy be-came active in civic affairs, serving as vice chairman of Montgomery County’s Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice Commission and as chair of the town council of Chevy Chase Section 4. He served in the Army’s JAG Corps where, in his typically self-deprecating style, he described his several years in Ice-land as time honing his salmon-fishing technique with visiting senior officers. Upon his return to the United States in the early 1960s, John served as exec-utive assistant to the board of mon-itors appointed by the court to oversee the Teamsters as part of a Department of Justice settlement with the union concerning charges for corruption. He became a trial attorney in the Justice Department and a trusted aide to At-torneys General Robert Kennedy and Nicholas Katzenbach. To be with Cassidy was to be with history. I remember once, when I walked him out of the Russell Building by my office in SR–135, he looked out at the Upper Senate Park extending down to where the Teamsters building stood. John gazed over and said, ‘‘Hoffa used to call that the ‘Trail of Tears’ as he came up to testify in the Senate.’’ With that, he was off to Constitution Avenue to flag a cab back to his office. That was what life with Cassidy was like, and I will miss that so much about him. Indeed, conversations with Cassidy were not ripped from a ‘‘Law & Order’’ marathon, a rapid-fire back and forth of case citations. Conversations with Cassidy were a meandering path, filled with history, commentary, a few rec-ipes, jokes, and, yes, gardening tips. Conversations with Cassidy were an ex-perience to be savored and long remem-bered. In 1965, Cassidy left Justice, forming the Miller, Cassidy, Larroca & Lewin law firm with several of his former col-leagues. Bill France, Sr., the founder of NASCAR, a major target of Hoffa’s ef-forts, became one of the firm’s anchor clients, a relationship that lasted for decades. Miller, Cassidy, Larroca & Lewin became a go-to law firm for pub-lic officials and business leaders under investigation for criminal offenses, a cadre that multiplied during the Wa-tergate prosecutions and under the Independent Counsel Act that followed. Miller Cassidy went on to represent a President, two former Attorneys Gen-eral, numerous Senators and Rep-resentatives, six judges, and dozens of high-ranking executive branch offi-cials. When former partner Jamie Gorelick was nominated to be Deputy Attorney General in 1994, the Wall Street Jour-nal said of the firm in an editorial that ‘‘among Beltway bigwigs, its phone number is posted right next to 911.’’ For a small law firm, a remarkable number of the firm’s alumni were con-firmed by the Senate to positions in the judicial and executive branches. They include a Deputy Attorney Gen-eral, a Solicitor General, two Assistant Secretaries of the Treasury for Ter-rorist Financing, General Counsels of the CIA and Defense Department, three Federal appellate judges, and three U.S. District judges. No fewer than a dozen alumni became deans or profes-sors at prominent law schools. Nearly all were mentored during their careers by John Cassidy. In 2001, John called to tell me that he and most of the other lawyers from Miller Cassidy were joining the Wash-ington, DC, office of Baker Botts, where he continued to practice until the brief illness that preceded his death. Throughout his career at Miller Cassidy and Baker Botts, John was re-nowned for how passionately he fought to protect the interests of his clients, many of whom remained friends for decades after their legal matters were resolved. Former Secretary of Treasury and later Secretary of State James Baker, a senior partner at Baker Botts, said to me about John Cassidy, ‘‘John Cassidy was a great lawyer, but he was also, I think more importantly, a great friend. He had all the tools one would look for in an advocate and an advisor, and he knew how to work both the judicial process and the negotiating table to the benefit of his clients. But John also really cared about your response when he asked ’How are you doing?’ He was truly a genuine person, and it seems we are missing too many of his kind of people these days . . . and not only in the legal profession.’’ There are so many fond memories I have of life with Cassidy. Indeed, my relationship with him started over a legal matter, but we quickly became friends, and that was true for so many of my colleagues who sought John’s ca-pable legal advice to save us from de-mise. I remember how John would inter-rupt tense negotiations with a quick quip or story that changed the room’s dynamic and helped bring resolution to the matter at hand. I remember how he would bring to restaurants his famous jams from his carefully tended Berry Farm in Potomac. At Ristorante Tosca, he was often seen bringing his homemade caramels or preserves into the kitchen, insisting the chef and staff partake of his food long before he ever ordered his meal. I remember Cassidy’s love of golf led him to significant charitable work with the Tiger Woods Foundation. John and I were equally skilled as golfers, and that is not a compliment to him or me. While even on our very best days neither of us could threaten to break par, playing golf with John was an experience that ran counter to the title, but fully in the spirit, of Tom Boswell’s wryly named book, ‘‘A Good Walk Spoiled.’’ Spending time with John was always a treasure. I remember John’s vibrant pastel drawings; he often drew inspiration from his magnificent garden at the Berry Farm—garden with berries and flowers, herbs, and Mr. Stripey tomato plants ten feet high. Such was his bounty. I rue that I will never be able to pour over his draft memoirs, surely to be one of the most interesting tomes in recent history. Once, I asked Cassidy when he was planning on retiring. He wasn’t sure. Cindy tells me, at 65, he decided to delay the decision 5 years—at 70, an-other 5 years—at 75, another 5 years. I have no doubt, at 90, he would have given the same reply. In a tribute to Cassidy, his nephew, Jim, said, ‘‘John Cassidy was a friend of motorsports, a friend of NASCAR and a friend to just about whoever made his acquaintance. And he was so much more.’’ That sums it up. John Cassidy was a friend to this body, a friend to our in-stitution, and a friend to me. His pass-ing is a loss to his family, his many friends and colleagues, and most of all, this country that he loved so much. I will miss him.

REMEMBERING DONALD DOHERTY Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, McHenry, IL, lost one of its favorite sons on November 21. Donald Doherty was the mayor of McHenry from 1961 to 1973. He was a county board member for 20 years. He was a husband, a fa-ther, grandfather, a veteran of the U.S.

Army, and someone who truly loved his community. He was 91 years old. If you go down Green Street in McHenry, you will come to the inter-section of Pearl Street and Green Street and a sign for Honorary Donald P. Doherty Drive. Donald loved living in McHenry. People could always find Donald along Green Street at St. Pat-rick’s Church or at city hall or at his family’s drug store, Bolger Drugs. McHenry and his family were his life. Before Donald became mayor in 1961, he ran the Bolger Drug Store. He was famous for going out of his way to help customers. If his store didn’t have it, he would make sure the customer got it. The community rewarded him by choosing him to be mayor for 12 years. His love of the community continued well after his time as mayor. He went on to serve as a member of the county board, the Knights of Columbus, and the McHenry Area Chamber of Com-merce where he received the chamber’s highest honor, the Frank E. Low Award. Donald often would consult succeeding mayors if they needed help. During McHenry Fiesta Days, you could find him as the parade marshal. Donald helped make McHenry a bet-ter place to live for people. He loved car rides, playing bingo with his friends at the McHenry Country Club, and he missed playing Scrabble with his late wife, Rosalie. He leaves behind 10 children and 21 grandchildren.

TRIBUTE TO CATHY HURWIT Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to thank a re-markable woman whose commitment to justice has helped more people in my State and in our Nation than she will probably ever know. Her name is Cathy Hurwit. For the last 20 years, she has served as chief of staff to my friend from Chicago, Con-gresswoman Jan Schakowsky. Cathy Hurwit is retiring from public service at the end of this year. This week, as she was packing up her office in the Rayburn building, a coworker happened to see her pull a photo from a drawer and pack it away with her books and files. It was a signed photo of Cathy with President Barack Obama. That small incident tells you a lot about Cathy Hurwit. You see, for Cathy, public service has never been about personal gain. She has no use for ‘‘vanity walls’’ covered with photos of herself with powerful people. Where others might hang a photo of themselves with a President, Cathy Hurwit hangs a poster from a rally to save Social Security and Medicare. For her, public service has always been about helping others and making our government better and fairer. Cathy Hurwit is an icon in the pro-gressive movement. She is committed to her values, and she is a genius at or-ganizing and legislating. She knows how to use power to help others, whether in the minority or majority. She didn’t set out to work on Capitol Hill. Her first job after college was working as an AmeriCorps VISTA vol-unteer, helping migrant laborers in Utah. She went back to school to earn a master’s in journalism. After her first year, she was hired as a summer intern by Congressman Toby Moffett. She never went back to ‘‘J school.’’ She worked as Congressman Moffett’s energy policy director for 3 years. She then worked as adviser to the Subcommittee on Environment, En-ergy, and Natural Resources of the House Government Operations Com-mittee, followed by 2 years as legisla-tive director for then-Congressman, now Senator, EDMARKEY . Cathy left Capitol Hill to become leg-islative director for Citizen Action, a coalition of progressive organizations, from 1988 to 1997. After that came 2 years as legislative director and healthcare policy expert for the Amer-ican Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, one of the great public employee unions in our country. Cathy had vowed never to return to Capitol Hill. Thank goodness, Con-gresswoman S
CHAKOWSKY persuaded her to change her mind. Few people know more than Cathy Hurwit about the complexities of healthcare policy or about the con-sequences of the healthcare policy de-cisions we make in Congress for ordi-nary people. If you are among the mil-lions of Americans who are grateful that insurers can no longer deny you coverage or charge you astronomically more for health insurance because of a preexisting medical condition, you can thank Cathy Hurwit. She was fighting for a Patients’ Bill of Rights more than 20 years ago. With Congresswoman S
CHAKOWSKY and others, she helped to include that and other essential protec-tions in the Affordable Care Act. Her work has improved the lives of millions of Americans. While Cathy is leaving the Hill, she is not leaving the fight. I hope that she will find a little more time to enjoy a good show at the Kennedy Center. I know that she will continue to be a force for social justice.

BIPARTISANSHIP Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on No-vember 6, millions of Americans, in-cluding thousands of Vermonters, headed to the polls to cast their votes in these midterm elections. Back home, Vermonters reelected our gov-ernor, Governor Phil Scott, a Repub-lican, to another term in office. They also returned Democratic majorities to the State house and senate. I was moved by the remarks deliv-ered by Governor Scott on election night. Of the elections, he said, ‘‘Vermonters are saying they want us to work for them, not against each other. They are saying we need to lis-ten to one another and prove to the rest of the nation that in Vermont we can and will rise above partisan poli-tics.’’ I have spoken in Vermont about Gov-ernor Scott’s speech. I believe his re-marks show how we work together in Vermont and how we should work to-gether in Washington. I am proud of the challenge put forth by Governor Scott. I know that, in Vermont, it is a challenge we can meet. The book will soon close on the 115th Congress, one in which one party con-trolled majorities in both the House and Senate and the White House. The book will open on the 116th Congress, where I hope we can move forward with the bipartisan spirit that Governor Scott challenged us all to adopt in his remarks on election night. As it has throughout our Nation’s history, Vermont is leading by example. It is an example I implore every Senator to fol-low. Let’s focus on what unites us, rather than promote greater division between us. I ask unanimous consent that the re-marks of Vermont Governor Phil Scott be printed in the RECORD . There being no objection, the mate-rial was ordered to be printed in the R

IGHT SPEECH —TUESDAY , NOVEMBER 6, 2018 Thank you all very much for being here to-night. First, I want to thank my family—espe-cially my wife Diana and my daughters Erica and Rachael, my mom and many other fam-ily members for their love and support. I wouldn’t be standing here today without you. Throughout my life—whether it be in busi-ness, racing or politics—I’ve been able to bring people together who have the right at-titude and chemistry. I’d like to first thank my team. Both my campaign team who worked long days that became longer nights; as well I want to thank my cabinet and my staff who stuck with me through thick and thin. I’m blessed with an incredibly talented team, so loyal and bright, who have spent the last two years working to make the vision we share for Vermont a reality. Now I know we’ve taken tonight off, but I look forward to continuing our work, with all of you, first thing tomorrow morning. Tonight, 180 Vermonters were elected to serve as our Legislature for the next two years. I want to personally congratulate each of them—some here this evening. I look for-ward to working with you in the coming months. And ‘‘work’’ being the key word be-cause there’s so much to do. There are few higher honors than being elected by your neighbors, for them to have enough faith and trust in you to represent them and their interests and be the person they are counting on to work on the issues that are most important to them and your community. And there’s no greater responsibility than working every day to understand and solve the problems facing our state. For those newly elected, like I was 18 years ago, you may still think everything is black or white, yes or no, but I would warn you, there’s a lot of gray in between. Typically, there are no easy answers, no corners to cut—only hard work ahead, to do all we can to create a stronger, more vibrant future for all of us.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES7908 December 19, 2018 
In electing a Governor of one party and a legislature led by another the message Vermonters have sent us tonight is clear: work together. Vermonters are saying they want us to work for them, not against each other. They are saying we need to listen to one another and prove to the rest of the nation that in Vermont we can and will rise above partisan politics. We must come together for the future of our state in order to strengthen our econ-omy, make Vermont affordable and protect the vulnerable in all 251 communities in Vermont. Whether you’re from Brighton or Brandon, Alburgh or Albany—we all want the same thing. We want the kids in every community to get a great education, learn a trade, pursue the career of their dreams, buy a home, start a family and retire right here in the state we love. This is the challenge we face together. And tonight, I humbly accept that challenge once again. I’d also like to thank my opponent, Chris-tine Hallquist, for stepping up and running an energized and historic campaign. While we may not have agreed on many issues, we did agree from the start that this race would be about the things we felt mattered most to the people of Vermont. While across the nation other races in other states turned negative and uncivil, in Vermont, we rose above it. The news out of Vermont this election was clear: we can disagree, we can debate—and we can do it with passion—but in this state, we can do it respectfully. It wasn’t perfect. And at times we were re-minded that we’re not immune to the hate and bigotry that is all too present around the country, but by and large, this campaign was marked by the type of civility Vermonters, and Americans for that matter, deserve in our public process. There was probably no better example of that than Zac Mayo and Lucy Rodgers of Cambridge, two candidates, ending a debate last month by sitting together to perform a musical duet. For this, and for stepping up, and putting yourself out there, I’d like to thank all can-didates tonight. From the top of the ticket all the way down, it’s not easy to put yourself out there—win or lose. So, I thank you for your contribution to the conversation and com-mitment to making Vermont a better place. I’d also like to note that the issues that have been raised in this campaign due to Christine’s historic candidacy are front and center. I want you to know that as long as I’m Governor, I’ll continue to make sure our state lives up to our motto of freedom and unity as well as our reputation of tolerance and compassion by being the most wel-coming in the nation, while defending all Vermonters from hate and bigotry. This will remain one of my administra-tion’s top priorities—no exceptions. Today, Vermonters spoke loud and clear. So, tonight, I’ll reaffirm my commitment to the three principles on which my adminis-tration bases every decision we make: First, we’re going to continue to make Vermont more affordable. I travel the state every day, I see the struggles our neighbors face and I know that the high cost of living, doing business, en-ergy, healthcare, education and taxes are forcing too many to look elsewhere for op-portunity. We should all find that unacceptable. So, as I’ve done for the past 18 years, I’ll spend the next two, working to reverse that trend. Second, if we’re going to grow our econ-omy, we must bring more into the workforce and attract more people to our state. We need more kids in our schools, more workers for our businesses, more proud, first time homeowners right here in Vermont. We need a bigger labor force to support the public investments we care about because if we don’t—if we can’t grow our economy— then we’re faced with two options: raise taxes or make cuts to programs which could harm the most vulnerable, neither of which is acceptable. That’s why I ask legislators, in fact, all elected officials to work with me on a plan to grow our workforce to increase our work-ing age population because our future lit-erally depends on it. Third, we’re going to protect our neigh-bors. We’ll continue to address the opioid crisis, those suffering from mental health issues and find ways to make sure all Vermonters have access to affordable healthcare. We’ll take care of our elderly and our vet-erans—who have given so much to us—our children, and those who need us most, when they need us most because it’s what we do in Vermont. And finally, if we’re going to accomplish any of this, we must continue to rise above partisanship and politics of hate and divi-sion. Our time to make a difference for those who have elected us, is far too short. We can’t allow ourselves to fall victim to petti-ness, political games and angry rhetoric. Now more than ever, we must be better role models because our children are watch-ing, and they want to be just like us. We must be better, kinder and more re-spectful to each other and take the time to listen. This is the challenge ahead. This is my vi-sion for our future. It is the greatest honor of my life to have the trust of Vermonters to carry out this work on their behalf. Thank you again from the bottom of my heart and as I’ve done throughout my entire life, I will do my very best not to let you down. f 
TRIBUTE TO LLOYD SQUIRES Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, small business are at the heart of many com-munities around the country, but in a small State like Vermont, local busi-nesses and their owners truly bring people together. Lloyd Squires and his bustling Burlington bagel business, Myer’s Bagels, is one example. For the past 22 years, Lloyd has dedicated his life to running this Vermont establish-ment, making more than 3,000 hand- rolled bagels every day. Lloyd grew up in Montreal and strug-gled with homelessness as a teenager. However, his life turned around at age 15 when Myer Lewkowicz, the owner of the Montreal-famous St-Viateur Bagel, offered Lloyd a job that allowed him to finish school, put a roof over his head, and learn from Myer’s teaching. Myer had moved to Montreal and started his bagel business in the 1950s, having sur-vived the Buchenwald concentration camp. Lloyd worked side-by-side with Myer for 15 years until Myer passed away. To honor his mentor, Lloyd opened up Myer’s Bagels in Burlington, VT, in 1996. Lloyd has worked tirelessly over the last two decades to develop his growing business. Before Lloyd received his green card, he would drive the 4-hour roundtrip from his home in Montreal to Burlington, VT, each day. Lloyd lives much closer now, but still drives 4 hours each day to deliver bagels around the region. Lloyd gives 1,200 ba-gels away each week to local charities. When asked, Lloyd will tell you that his favorite part about running his business and working incredibly long hours is being able to talk to his cus-tomers and develop close relationships with the community. I am proud to recognize the business and community that Lloyd Squires has helped create in Vermont over the past 20 years. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the RECORD a Burlington Free Press article titled, ‘‘A day in the life of Lloyd Squires, Vermont’s ‘best’ bagel maker.’’ It shares Lloyd’s hard work and the story of how he has gone from being homeless as a teenager to a cornerstone of our community. There being no objection, the mate-rial was ordered to be printed in the R
ECORD , as follows: 
[FROM THE BURLINGTON FREEPRESS, NOV. 23, 2018] D
AY IN THE LIFE OF A BAGEL MAKER  (By Evan Weiss) Lloyd Squires, 54, wakes up in his South Burlington home as he does every day: with-out an alarm. He puts on a layer of Under Armour, a Montreal Canadiens T-shirt and a matching Canadiens hat. He likes hockey. He’d fallen asleep around 9:30 the night before, watching his team lose to the Sabres. He rarely gets four hours of sleep. 2:00 a.m. Lloyd, the founder and co-owner of Myer’s Bagels, drives to a gas station and picks up a cup of coffee. In Burlington, Kountry Kart Deli is busy making sandwiches for a less-thansober crowd. It is late for them, early for Lloyd. 2:10 a.m. He turns off Pine Street and arrives at Myer’s, backing into a spot that directly faces the shop. I tell him I think that says something about him, that most people would pull straight in. He says he likes to shine his headlights on the bakery because it’s been broken into three times this year. If there’s ever danger, he says later, there’s a machete hidden inside. He unlocks the door and a large banner welcomes us in cursive: Myer’s Bagels. A Taste of Old Montreal. Myer Lewkowicz, the namesake for the shop, was a survivor of Buchenwald con-centration camp. He moved to Mile End, Montreal’s historically Jewish neighborhood, in 1953 and cofounded the famous St-Viateur Bagel in 1957. In 1980, Lloyd was 15 and homeless, sleep-ing in a park for five days. He took an over-night factory job and went to schoolduring the day. After his third shift, walking by St- Viateur at 3 a.m., Myer asked what he was doing out so early every morning. He offered Lloyd a job on the spot, a job Lloyd credits with saving his life: 13-hour days, Friday, Saturday and Sunday, so he could stay in school. Later, Myer would offer Lloyd the day shift, which he happily accepted. He’d soon discover that the ‘‘day shift’’ was 3 a.m. to 4 p.m. six days a week. 2:11 a.m.

‘‘First thing I do is put on the radio. First person gets to choose the station for the day.’’ Lloyd chooses country music. 2:12 a.m. He turns the faucet to fill the kettle. Ba-gels are traditionally made by boiling before baking (though some commercial bakers will use steam to save time and money). 2:14 a.m. He re-activates the fire with paper and Middlebury-sourced wood. New York-style bagels, the most common variety, are usually machinerolled, boiled in tap water and baked in a gas oven. Montreal-style bagels are traditionally hand-rolled, boiled in honey water and baked in a wood-fired oven. 2:15 a.m. He mixes Red Star yeast with a bucket of water and gets the flour ready. 2:25 a.m. He throws all of the ingredients into a 50- year-old Canadian mixer. He says he has a new $20,000 model waiting in the wings, but he likes the old one better—it’s the same kind he learned on at St-Viateur. He likes reminiscing about his time there. Myer, he says, once bought football tickets for six employees. They all showed up to St- Viateur, excited, and stuffed into Myer’s car. He drove two blocks, parked and told them they were all taking the subway: ‘‘I’m not paying for parking.’’ Myer later helped Lloyd buy his first house. Lloyd worked at St-Viateur for 15 years, half of his life at that point, and only left after Myer died of cancer. 2:32 a.m. Lloyd makes coffee, so some will be ready when the shop opens at 4 a.m. The fire is already roaring. 3:06 a.m. He pours the requisite honey into the ket-tle. 3:27 a.m. The gluten-free bagels are ‘‘dropped’’ first. Lloyd created his own GF flour mix and is the only one who makes it in the bakery. In total, he has 42 bagel recipes. His favorite is ‘‘Montreal Spice Whole Wheat . . . which we don’t sell. I make them just for me.’’ 3:30 a.m. The first batch of dough is ready. On a nor-mal day, the bakery will go through four of these 140-pound masses. 3:32 a.m. The rolling begins. The room already smells of honey and toasted sesame seeds. 3:40 a.m. The boiling begins. As Lloyd drops the first gluten-full bagels, he says he sees money differently. ‘‘When I bought a car, I went, ‘That’s 15,000 bagels. I have to make those!’’’ 3:52 a.m. Baker Matt Audette, 25, covers the boiled bagels in rosemary. They go in the oven im-mediately. Matt was born and raised in Vermont, but came from a pretzel-baking job in Washington, D.C. He likes the early hours. 4:02 a.m. 17-year-old Kyle McGuire has worked at Myer’s for two months, and Lloyd is by his side, training him to roll. When Kyle is done with his shift, he’ll go home to shower and head to Colchester High School, where he’s a senior. Lloyd says he trained 100 bakers at St- Viateur; 75 are still there. 4:08 a.m. The shop has been open for eight minutes. Everyone is working quickly before the morning rush. 4:09 a.m. The second batch of dough goes in the mixer. 4:16 a.m. The ready bagels are tossed into a long metal tray called the chute. Lloyd organizes them. 4:34 a.m. Matt ensures the boiled bagels are fully covered. The honey in the water helps make everything stick. 4:58 a.m. The first customers arrive, tired and hun-gry. 5:06 a.m. Lloyd moves to the station where his team slices bagels headed for bags. He explains that each bagel has to be cut with a knife be-cause the hand-rolling process results in varying shapes unfit for a standard slicer. There were three main jobs at St-Viateur, he says: bagging, rolling and baking. Myer had told Lloyd that as he worked his way up, he’d make more money. Lloyd retold this story, laughing, because he learned that the increased pay didn’t come from a better hourly rate, but from the longer hours re-quired: baggers worked 20, rollers worked 40 and bakers worked 75. 5:18 a.m. Batch two is ready for rolling. There are five ingredients in the dough: -King Arthur’s Sir Lancelot High- GlutenFlour -Malted Barley Flour ? Sugar -Water -Yeast Lloyd estimates that 3,000 to 4,000 pounds of King Arthur flour and 400 pounds of Green Mountain Creamery cream cheese are consumed during an average week. 5:30 a.m. Lloyd finally sits down for breakfast: a plain bagel with lox, scallion cream cheese and tomatoes. He washes it down with a Nat-alie’s orange juice and is done by 5:35 a.m. It’s the only non-bathroom break he takes during his 8.5 hours in the bakery. 5:38 a.m. The chute is already littered with seeds be-neath the wire baskets. Over the course of the day, three to five pounds of seeds will end up there. They’ll be collected and thrown in the fire because they still have oil. ‘‘It flavors the oven,’’ Lloyd says. 5:39 a.m. He mans the oven, which he built with three friends over five 18-hour days, using 3,700 fire bricks. He’ll occasionally make pizza with his dough, adding crushed tomato, garlic and 15-year-aged provolone, which he’ll top with his Montreal spice mix. It’s not on the menu, but he’ll make it for party- sized orders. 6:36 a.m. Dough number three is thrown in the mixer. It’s clear that the machine is old: a clamp and bag of flour keep it closed. 6:40 a.m. A rush of customers begins. 6:47 a.m. Lloyd rolls with Kyle again. Matt and Kyle explain how Lloyd can roll a bagel and throw it perfectly into place any-where across the table, or even into the oven. 6:55 a.m. Lloyd rolls alone again. I clock him at roughly a baker’s dozen per minute. He says he could get up to 38, if needed, though he’s recovering from an eye injury. He’s worked with people who could do 40 to 45, no problem. 7:32 a.m. Matt calls out, ‘‘Fresh rosemary!’’ Two customers grin and peer over to see the bagels lobbed into the chute. The bagels are flipped and flung using a long wooden paddle called a shebah. The spelling of this word varies. When asked why it’s called a shebah, Lloyd says, ‘‘That’s what he called it.’’ ‘‘He’’ means Myer. Lloyd used to buy the paddles in Montreal, but now commissions them from Sterling Furniture Works across the street. They start as blonde, unvarnished wood. Over time, they develop a dark patina in the oven, the far edge turning black. 7:36 a.m. Kyle asks Lloyd, ‘‘How’s it going?’’ Lloyd replies, ‘‘Living the dream.’’ He always responds, ‘‘Living the dream’’ or ‘‘Rolling in the dough,’’ Kyle says. They both laugh. 7:50 a.m. The rolling continues. Lloyd estimates they’ve made 110 dozen bagels thus far. They bake between 250 and 300 dozen on an average day, he says, which is 3,000 to 3,600 bagels for those of us who don’t think in doz-ens. 8:08 a.m. One burnt bagel comes out of the oven. It goes into the fire next to the seeds. Lloyd says Myer couldn’t stand seeing any-thing wasted because of his time in the Holo-caust. According to the St-Viateur website, Myer once spoke to a high school class and said, ‘‘At Buchenwald, all I dreamt of was a piece of bread.’’ 8:10 a.m. Kyle leaves, but before he does, out of ear-shot of Lloyd, he says, ‘‘He’s a really awe-some boss.’’ 8:16 a.m. Lloyd takes the last sip of his gas station coffee, over six hours after he bought it. A group of visiting Austrians, who stopped by the day before, say hi. One takes a pic-ture, and Lloyd gives her a free bagel. 8:20 a.m. Lloyd hands a bag to someone from a local non-profit. He estimates that on an average week, he donates 100 dozen to local charities, including the Flynn Center for the Per-forming Arts and Resource’s YouthBuild. 8:23 a.m. A police officer arrives for breakfast. 8:24 a.m. There’s a line, and the tables are full. Lloyd won’t tell you, but Myer’s has been named best bagel shop in Vermont by Epicurious, among others. Why? It could be because people love Lloyd; he prefers phone orders to web orders because he likes talking to his customers and seeing how they’re doing. It could be be-cause he learned from Myer Lewkowicz, one of the Montreal-style originators. It could be because St-Viateur has greatly expanded its bagel production while Myer’s is still only made in one bakery, one batch at a time. It could be all three. 8:34 a.m. 
The third batch of dough is ready. Lloyd cuts into it and it looks like a sushi chef cut-ting into a side of tuna. 8:50 a.m. An ex-Montrealer, who now owns a busi-ness in Winooski, greets Lloyd in French. Lloyd later says that the man, Marcel, was his first-ever customer in 1996. 9:00 a.m. A group of people watch Lloyd roll his ba-gels. I ask what it’s like to always be watched. He says, ‘‘I like to talk to people.’’ 9:05 a.m. Trisha Ubermuth, 25, stands on a milk crate to organize the bagels. In the past, Lloyd has told the story that she once came in as a child and declared she’d work there one day. It’s not true, but Lloyd tells me that bagels are, in fact, a family business. His sister, mother and nephew still work at St-Viateur. His daughter works for his cous-in who runs his own bagel shop, Brossard Bagel, just outside of Montreal. 9:07 a.m.

Lloyd gives a free, hot poppy seed bagel to Marcel, knowing it’s his favorite. 9:31 a.m. The rush slows. Everyone works at the same pace. 10:31 a.m. Lloyd finally leaves, but he’s not done. Ahead of him, he’s got over four hours of driving through Northern Vermont with seven bagel drop-offs on the way. He doesn’t dread it though, it’s a pretty drive. And, ‘‘I love getting out and meeting people.’’ He’s got another bagel inhand for lunch. ‘‘My car is covered in sesame seeds,’’ he says. 7:15 p.m. He finally gets home after only stopping for a break at Piecasso in Stowe. He’s used to long drives. When he first opened Myer’s in 1996, he commuted from Montreal, leaving at mid-night every ‘‘morning.’’ He got his green card in 1997. After three years of the 100-mile commute, and a car accident caused by sleeping at the wheel, he moved to Vermont. He then worked 15-hour days, seven days a week for seven years. ‘‘I’ve never worked less than 65 hours a week,’’ he says. He’s barely gotten outside of Vermont and Montreal because of the schedule. Now, for-tunately, he gets a day off on the weekend. He’s recently been to both Connecticut and Boston. He hopes one day to retire in Nova Scotia. But, first, he’s going to open a new take-and- bake bagel business with his friend Sid Berkson in Enosburg Falls. And, he’s still got a bakery to run. 9:30 p.m. He drinks chamomile tea and falls asleep, again, to hockey. The next morning, he wakes up without an alarm at 1:15 a.m. It’s Saturday, and there will be twice as many customers. He looks forward to meeting them. f 
TRIBUTE TO JOHN J. SULLIVAN Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, earlier this month, Marcelle and I, with Marcelle’s brother, Claude Pomerleau, attended the Kennedy Center Honors Dinner at the State Department. We were moved by Deputy Secretary of State John J. Sullivan’s remarks, which touched on his deep admiration for foreign service and his great appre-ciation of American arts and culture. I wanted to share with the Senate his re-marks, which were filled with histor-ical references and bits of humor. I ask unanimous consent that Deputy Secretary of State Sullivan’s remarks be printed in the R
ECORD . There being no objection, the mate-rial was ordered to be printed in the R

CENTER DEPUTY SECRETARY OF STATE JOHNJ. S
ULLIVAN  R
EMARKS AT THE 2018 K ENNEDY CENTER  H
ONORS  
DECEMBER 2 , 2018, WASHINGTON , D.C. DEPUTY SECRETARY SULLIVAN: Good evening. It’s an honor for my wife, Grace Rodriguez, and me to welcome you to the De-partment of State. Secretary Pompeo asked that I extend his sincere regrets he’s unable to be with us tonight because of his travel to Buenos Aires for the G20 summit. It’s a real privilege to be asked to stand in for the Sec-retary of State at a very special event like this. Deputy secretaries are usually dele-gated humbler duties. I’d like to begin by thanking Kennedy Cen-ter Chairman David Rubenstein, Kennedy Center President Deborah Rutter, Event Chair Suzanne Niedland for their service and leadership. And thanks to all of you in at-tendance tonight for coming to honor the es-teemed recipients of this year’s Kennedy Center Honor. Gathered as we are in the Department of State, I must note with a heavy heart the passing last night in Texas of President George H.W. Bush, my former boss many years ago. President Bush cherished this place and this institution. He was, of course, the U.S. permanent representative in the United Nations in the early 1970s, and later our first representative to the People’s Re-public of China. And since we’re gathered in the Benjamin Franklin Room, I also note that President Bush shares a distinction with Franklin: They both served as our na-tion’s representative to a vitally important country but without holding the title of am-bassador. 1974, when President Bush was named the chief of our liaison office in Bei-jing, the United States did not have diplo-matic relations with China. Two hundred years before, when Franklin was sent on a commission to France and then appointed our minister in Paris, the Court of Versailles would not accept an ambassador from a self- declared republic like ours. Only sovereign monarchs exchanged ambassadors until well into the 19th century. I’ve thought a lot about Franklin during my service as deputy secretary of state. We host many special historic events here in the Benjamin Franklin Room, including a lunch-eon earlier this year for President Macron of France during his state visit to the United States, and I’m often asked to provide re-marks. The speechwriters who prepared a first draft appropriately note the venue, and refer to Franklin as the first American dip-lomat, our minister to France. But they also inevitably described him as, quote, ‘‘the fa-ther of the Foreign Service.’’ And that’s al-ways struck me as a stale, patriarchal lan-guage unsuited for the 21st century, and un-likely to inspire young Foreign Service offi-cers. But my effort to craft an alternative that would motivate a new generation to ca-reers in American diplomacy—those efforts have failed recently. I spoke to a group of eminent retired U.S. diplomats here in this room; they were confused and appalled when I referred to Franklin as the original gang-ster of the Foreign Service. (Laughter.) So I’ve shifted my thinking to alternatives to enliven the way we convey the remark-able life of Franklin. I had the idea of bring-ing Franklin’s story to life on the stage, per-haps even a musical. (Laughter.) Who would want to see that? Imagine, a musical about one of America’s founding fathers. (Laugh-ter.) You laugh, but in fact, there was a Broadway musical about Franklin, Ben Franklin in Paris, staged in 1964, and it faded quickly into obscurity. (Laughter.) But I’m serious about promoting and hon-oring America’s diplomats past and present, whether it’s Franklin, President Bush, or our current friends and colleagues at this depart-ment who are working to promote and pro-tect America’s interests, America’s values, and American citizens at hundreds of posts, embassies, consulates, and missions around the world, many in dangerous and difficult circumstances. Their work is made easier by the worldwide popularity—indeed, the perva-sive influence—of the best of American arts and culture, which is what we’re here to cel-ebrate tonight. It is through the arts that we, the Amer-ican people, tell our story. We express the richness of our culture and artistry when we export it to the rest of the world. And the impact cannot be overstated. Music, theater, cinema—every medium we celebrate tonight (inaudible) United States shows to the world who we are. The work of the American art-ists gathered here in this room is a powerful form of diplomacy. Your influence is felt around the world. The Kennedy Center Honors program rec-ognizes these exceptional artists who have contributed so much to our culture and our world. The program is in its 41st year, and its honorees include some of the most iconic figures in the arts. This year’s honorees cer-tainly fall squarely into that category. Cher, our first honoree, needs no introduc-tion. She’s commonly referred to as the, quote, ‘‘goddess of pop,’’ unquote, and I test-ed that assertion with a Google search, whose results showed that to be true. (Laughter.) But I use the word ‘‘commonly’’ with a purpose, because that is too common a title for such an extraordinary talent and person. She’s achieved towering success in music, on television, on stage, and in films. The accolades included here are too many to name. Her voice and her music—‘‘I Got You Babe,’’ ‘‘If I Could Turn Back Time,’’ ‘‘Be-lieve’’—I could go on, to name just a few— those songs are loved worldwide and have made her a global superstar and a household name. Composer and pianist Philip Glass is our second honoree. He’s no stranger to State Department programs and proudly rep-resented the United States as a Fulbright Scholar in Paris in the 1960s. Since then, Mr. Glass has only gone on to compose more than 25 operas, 10 symphonies, as well as concertos, film soundtracks, and countless other works. Truly in a league of his own, he’s the recipient of the U.S. National Medal of the Arts, and next month the Los Angeles Philharmonic will present the world pre-miere of his 12th symphony. Our third honoree is another legend, Reba McEntire. And I am not ashamed to say as a humble bureaucrat, I can’t believe I got to shake Reba McEntire’s hand. (Laughter.) I’m telling you, it’s unbelievable. Thank you, Mike Pompeo. (Laughter.) Her songs— ‘‘Fancy,’’ ‘‘Is There Life Out There,’’ ‘‘I’m a Survivor’’—have given her worldwide fame. She’s recorded 25 number-one singles and sold over 56 million albums. But she’s achieved great success in other fields, in-cluding on television and in movies. All you have to do is say her first name, and the world knows exactly who you’re talking about. Wayne Shorter, the famous jazz saxo-phonist and composer is next. He deservedly has been called—and again, I quote—a ge-nius, trailblazer, a visionary, and one of the world’s greatest composers. He’s played with Miles Davis, Joni Mitchell, Steely Dan, Car-los Santana—the list goes on. He’s won 11 Grammy Awards, including a lifetime achievement award, but admirably, he does not rest on his laurels. He’s now working on his first album. Finally, we honor the co-creators of Ham-ilton, and I hope they will consider my sug-gestion of Franklin: An American Musical. I’m just saying, Hamilton’s secretary of treasury; versus the secretary of state. (Laughter.) Just think about that. These in-dividuals—Lin-Manuel Miranda, Thomas Kail, Andy Blankenbuehler, and Alex Lacamoire—together they wrote, acted in, directed, choreographed, and arranged what has become the best known, groundbreaking stage production of our time. They are trail-blazers who have created art that defies cat-egorization, breaks down barriers, and brings American history to life. My youngest son, Teddy, is a senior at Hamilton College and among the show’s big-gest fans. He likes to wear his college sweatshirt around Miami—excuse me, around Manhattan—and engage the tourists who ask where do they paraphernalia like

that from the show. (Laughter.) He patiently explains to them the merits of college, the musical, and being at the center of both. Now, I know I’m standing in the way of your dinner, so I will conclude with an ac-knowledgement of a prior Kennedy Center honoree—and I kind of slipped this before when I said Miami instead of Manhattan— and that’s because we’re joined tonight by Gloria Estefan. Welcome back. (Applause.) My wife Grace and the Rodriguez family are delighted to see whom we consider the first lady of Cuban Americans here tonight. Thank you, again, on behalf of the Depart-ment of State, for allowing us to be part of this celebration to pay tribute to the life-time contributions of the remarkable women and men we honor tonight. Please enjoy your dinner. Thanks. (Applause.) f 
TRIBUTE TO ENID WONNACOTT Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, a re-markable Vermonter has reached a re-markable milestone. Enid Wonnacott of Huntington, VT, deserves our thanks for and recognition of her more than 30 years of agricultural leadership in Vermont and the Nation. Enid has led the Northeast Organic Farming Association of Vermont, NOFA-VT, since 1987. Her early leader-ship of NOFA coincided with my chair-manship of the U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and For-estry. Enid was a constant source of counsel to me about the importance and unlimited potential of organic ag-riculture for Vermont and the Nation, and she was a strong advocate and ad-viser as I worked to make the National Organic Standards Act a part of the 1990 farm bill. This is the law that au-thorized the national organic standards and labeling program, ushering in the remarkable and still-burgeoning growth of America’s thriving organic sector. Since that time, Vermont continues to be a leader in our country’s now $60 billion annual organic industry. To this day, I continue to look to Enid for advice on organic agriculture and nu-trition issues. Enid Wonnacott’s many accomplishments are presented in a profile published in ‘‘Seven Days’’ in Vermont on October 30, 2018. I ask unanimous consent for the profile to be printed in the R
ECORD . There being no objection, the mate-rial was ordered to be printed in the R
ECORD , as follows: 
[Seven Days Vermont, October 30, 2018] L
ONGTIME ORGANIC AGLEADER ENID W
ONNACOTT STEPS DOWN (By Melissa Pasanen) Enid Wonnacott has tallied many accom-plishments over 30-plus years as executive director of the Northeast Organic Farming Association of Vermont. In 1987, her 10-hour- per-week job came with one filing cabinet and a milk crate filled with paperwork. Since then, Wonnacott has built the non-profit into a 20-person team supported by a $2.8 million budget. NOFA–VT has had an impact not only on Vermont agriculture but nationwide. Wonnacott started at the association the same year that Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) became chair of the Senate agriculture com-mittee. The two worked closely on devel-oping the National Organic Program, which eventually led to the creation of the U.S. De-partment of Agriculture organic seal in 2002. ‘‘Enid has been one of the most effective advocates for organic agriculture in the en-tire country,’’ Leahy told Seven Days via email, acknowledging that the road was long and that challenges continue. ‘‘Through all of this, as a leader, Enid has been patient but persistent and always a clear-eyed problem solver. I have often looked for Enid’s help on difficult policy challenges,’’ Leahy added, ‘‘and she has never been reluctant to let me know exactly what needs doing to support and strengthen organic agriculture.’’ ‘‘This is recognition of her role as guardian and voice of the organic movement,’’ Ross said. ‘‘It also recognizes the evolution of or-ganic as a significant and meaningful part of our economy in Vermont and the economy nationally.’’ Under Wonnacott’s guidance, NOFA–VT has become the go-to resource for organic farmers and gardeners, agricultural advo-cates, and locavores for everything from technical production assistance to com-prehensive lists of farmers markets and CSAs. There were fewer than 50 organic pro-ducers in 1987; now NOFA–VT certifies more than 700. Its robust farm-to-school partner-ship, subsidized farm shares and other efforts work to broaden access to local and organic food. The nonprofit’s mobile pizza oven, though, is probably the most vivid symbol of Wonnacott’s unique contributions: She em-bodies the warm heart of Vermont’s organic agriculture movement, pulling community together around organic food and the farm-ers who produce it. ‘‘I love that whole program and initiative as much as anything we do,’’ Wonnacott said, after smoothly maneuvering the oven into Burlington’s Intervale on a September afternoon. Later that day, she headed up a team of volunteers and Intervale Center em-ployees to bake pizzas for an event, hands in the dough, laughing and hugging longtime friends who stopped by. Launched in 2006, the portable pizza oven fulfilled a vision Wonnacott had for gath-ering people around food in a way that fos-tered connection and conversation. ‘‘I’m pas-sionate about community building,’’ she ex-plained. ‘‘I think people need and seek com-munity.’’ Particularly in the early days, freshly baked pizza helped raise NOFA–VT’s profile with consumers and farmers. The copper- domed, wood-fired oven on a trailer has logged thousands of miles and produced thousands of pizzas at events such as farmers markets and young-farmer socials. Since Wonnacott’s cancer diagnosis in 2014, working the oven has also provided a per-sonal benefit. ‘‘It’s such a physical, present thing to do, especially when you have chemo brain,’’ she said. ‘‘To get out and see people is a really healthy thing for me.’’ People who have worked with Wonnacott say her positive energy and balanced ap-proach have been both anchor and beacon through the hard work of building a move-ment. Mara Hearst, now a sheep farmer in Dor-set, was 19 when she first met Wonnacott, who invited her to become a student rep-resentative on the NOFA–VT board. Hearst said Wonnacott’s consistent message as a leader and mentor has been: ‘‘We need to make change, and there’s a shitload to do, but let’s take time to be a community to-gether.’’ ‘‘After hours, she’s the first one to turn on the music and get everyone dancing,’’ said NOFA-NY board member Elizabeth Hender-son. When she was founding president of NOFA-Mass., Henderson was on the com-mittee that originally hired Wonnacott for the Vermont chapter. ‘‘It’s one of the things I’m proudest of,’’ she said. The agricultural landscape has changed dramatically since Wonnacott became the nonprofit’s third executive director at age 26, fresh out of graduate school. According to the Organic Trade Associa-tion, organic food sales in the U.S. hit $45.2 billion in 2017 and accounted for 5.5 percent of all food sold. Twenty years ago, OTA’s first published sales figure was $3.4 billion. The USDA National Organic Program helped propel growth. However, its integrity has been questioned over the past couple of years based on media coverage of probable standards noncompliance by large organic dairy and egg operations. Investigation also revealed that some organic imports were re-ceiving fraudulent certifications. Then the USDA withdrew approved, strengthened or-ganic animal-welfare standards, though they had not yet been enforced. After her initial diagnosis but before her cancer spread, Wonnacott had planned to re-tire in 2021, when NOFA–VT will turn 50. ‘‘But it’s also a good time now,’’ she said. ‘‘I recognize there are a lot of changes to the organic industry, challenges to organic in-tegrity. I think there’s a need for really strong leadership, someone who has the en-ergy I had when I started.’’ After a pause she added, ‘‘I don’t have the fight anymore, just my love and appreciation for this movement. I want it to be shepherded by somebody with a lot of health and energy right now.’’ Wonnacott’s deep passion for agriculture was seeded while growing up on her family’s Weybridge homestead. Her mother was dean of students at Middlebury College. Her father died of cancer when Wonnacott, the youngest of three sisters, was 16. She spent a lot of time on a neighboring dairy farm, showed livestock at the fair and worked with a large animal veterinarian. At St. Lawrence University in New York State, Wonnacott studied biology and chem-istry and first learned about organic agri-culture. She relief-milked for a nearby or-ganic dairy and read Wendell Berry’s 1977 classic, The Unsettling of America: Culture & Agriculture. ‘‘You know when you read a book and you’re like, Oh, my God. This is what’s in my head,’’ she recalled. During a semester in Kenya, Wonnacott learned how to treat cobra bites and hand- milk a 70-cow herd. Kenyan agriculture was organic ‘‘by default,’’ she said. ‘‘There was money to supply inputs, but no one knew what to do with them. I saw huge piles of im-ported chemical fertilizer next to broken- down tractors.’’ As graduation neared, Wonnacott applied to veterinary school and, at her mother’s suggestion, for a yearlong Thomas J. Watson Fellowship to study alter-native agriculture. ‘‘My mom was a really strong role model as far as ‘women can do anything,’’’ Wonnacott said. ‘‘She supported what was in my heart.’’ She won the fellowship and worked on or-ganic farms in New Zealand, Nepal, Norway and England; the experience was pivotal. ‘‘It was an agricultural system that made com-mon sense to me, a culture of preventative management and health for the soil, the plants and the animals,’’ Wonnacott said. ‘‘I wanted to know, Why does the world not farm this way?’’ Back in the U.S., she taught biology and environmental education and became an or-ganic certification inspector before pursuing graduate studies at UVM.’’ I had to figure out why the world works the way it does,’’ she said. ‘‘How does our agriculture policy influence other countries? How do supply, demand and financial systems work?’’ For her thesis, Wonnacott interviewed organic farmers about the role of policy in effecting

change. ‘‘In the end, I felt like it’s all about grassroots—that was where change was going to come from,’’ she said. When Wonnacott landed the job at NOFA– VT shortly after finishing school, she built on her thesis contacts to launch that grass-roots effort. In the mid-’80s, Wonnacott re-called, ‘‘organic was really the under-ground.’’ Farmers told her they didn’t label produce organic because customers would as-sume it had worms. ‘‘People thought it was just hippies playing around,’’ she said. ‘‘It wasn’t respected.’’ Her goal, Wonnacott said, was to raise the status of the movement and provide support to farmers in the pre-internet age. She also prioritized developing a farmer-driven or-ganic certification program with lengthy discussions to hash out standards. ‘‘For me, fascinated by movement building, by how groups make decisions, these were really amazing meetings,’’ Wonnacott said. Jack Lazor of Butterworks Farm in West-field met Wonnacott when she was a grad-uate student and worked helping to deliver the farm’s yogurt to stores. He was part of the first community forum she later led in her new NOFA–VT role. ‘‘She did it all at the beginning,’’ Lazor said. ‘‘She built this thing up through goodwill and positive forces. She’s a force, but a gentle force.’’ At the time, organic standards were not consistent state to state, and Wonnacott soon found herself at the center of a sea change. Organic was growing rapidly, she recalled: ‘‘Sen. Leahy came to me. There was a lot of interest from California to create a level playing field for interstate trade. He wanted to know, ‘What does Vermont think of this?’’’ Wonnacott and other organic pio-neers were both nervous and hopeful about federal involvement. ‘‘It’s hard when you’ve been an underdog not to be totally wowed by the attention and money for research and or-ganic support,’’ she said. It soon became clear, she said, that a national organic pro-gram ‘‘was going to move forward with or without us and we had to put our energy into making it the best it could be.’’ Pragmatism is a Wonnacott hallmark, ac-cording to Megan Camp, vice president and program director at Shelburne Farms. The two women served together on a statewide council alongside diverse agriculture com-munity representatives. Tension would occa-sionally arise, Camp acknowledged: ‘‘Some people would pound the table, point fingers. Enid would make the same argument firmly, but always listening, able to hear multiple perspectives.’’ Wonnacott believes strongly that it doesn’t help to label types of farming as ‘‘good’’ or ‘‘bad.’’ But she recognizes that her approach has disappointed some. ‘‘We’re a really inclusive organization, and that’s been really important to me,’’ she said. ‘‘We want to move all farmers along the sustainability spectrum, never be organic elitist, never say this is the only way you can farm. ‘‘It’s been a conflict for some staff and some board members over the years, absolutely,’’ Wonnacott continued. This was particularly evident when the local food movement gathered momentum, sometimes at the expense of organic. ‘‘Our tagline has been, ‘Certified organic, locally grown’—you don’t have to choose,’’ she said. But in practice, consumers and farmers set their own priorities. For example, Wonnacott explained, if one local farmer sells eggs from free-range hens but also feeds them GMO grain and customers think that’s good enough, how can the local organic farmer charge the premium price that’s needed to cover expensive, non-GMO grain? Wonnacott is playing the long game. She believes that collaboration and mutual sup-port are critical to sustaining agriculture in Vermont and nudging more farmers toward organic practices. ‘‘I believe we can be both a movement builder and a bridge builder,’’ she said. ‘‘It’s allowed us to be at the table for a lot of really important conversations, and I think it was pivotal in my hall of fame award.’’ Andy Jones, manager of Burlington’s In-tervale Community Farm and former NOFA– VT board president, believes ‘‘the big tent’’ has served the agricultural community well. Early on, he noted, Wonnacott saw the ben-efit of offering technical assistance to con-ventional dairies that were exploring a tran-sition to organic. She recognized that farm- to-school programs could provide markets for local and organic farmers and also teach new generations to appreciate the food. ‘‘She always wanted to build the answer ‘‘to any problem, said Jones. She sought ‘‘ways to build the ag community, the rural commu-nity. She knows Vermont is stronger when everyone is successful.’’ Wonnacott understands that her successor will face challenges. NOFA–VT membership is stagnant at about 1,200 members, and this year’s winter conference attendance was down across NOFA state chapters. The USDA organic integrity issues have provoked frac-tures within the organic community, along with public confusion and distrust.’’ I fear for the future of organic, the splintering that’s taking place,’’ she admitted. Wonnacott is also concerned that new farmers don’t see a need to be certified, not-ing that Vermont is about to see a huge land shift and transition between generations. ‘‘I really want beginning farmers to feel there’s value in this movement,’’ she said. ‘‘We need a really strong beginning-farmer wave to re-place the pioneering farmers.’’ It’s fitting in some ways that Wonnacott is navigating a transition while also helping many of the farmers with whom she started her career navigate their own. She has co-fa-cilitated two meetings with the old guard. ‘‘It’s like deep therapy for all of us,’’ she said with a chuckle. ‘‘These are the farmers who really inspired me. I wanted to do everything I could to make their farms and their lives successful. That drive has carried me through, and I could have done it for another 30 years.’’ After she steps down in the spring, Wonnacott will stay involved in other ways. She’s training to become an organic inspec-tor and will do that part time. She will also help out during the pizza-oven season. But mostly, Wonnacott will focus on her health, her family—husband Harry Frank and their two grown children—and their Huntington homestead. It’s no surprise, though, that Wonnacott has not stopped dreaming up new, creative ways to support her passions. ‘‘One of my fa-vorite things to do is long-distance walk-ing,’’ she said, explaining that she has solo- walked trails around the world, most re-cently Ireland’s Dingle Way. Wonnacott en-visions a statewide farm-to-farm walk to raise awareness of organic agriculture and community. The Vermont walk would not be a solo endeavor, however. With her signature warm smile Wonnacott said, ‘‘I have a great vision of hundreds of people joining me to walk for the cause.’’ f 
ARMS SALES NOTIFICATION Mr. CORKER.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S7913 December 19, 2018 
(viii) Date Report Delivered to Congress: December 18, 2018. *As defined in Section 47(6) of the Arms Export Control Act. 
POLICY JUSTIFICATION  Turkey—Patriot Missile System and Related Support and Equipment Turkey has requested the possible sale of four (4) AN/MPQ–65 Radar Sets, four (4) En-gagement Control Stations, ten (10) Antenna Mast Groups (AMGs), twenty (20) M903 Launching Stations, eighty (80) Patriot MIM–104E Guidance Enhanced Missiles (GEM–T) missiles with canisters, sixty (60) PAC–3 Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE) missiles, and five (5) Electrical Power Plant (EPP) III. Also included with this request are communications equipment, tools and test equipment, range and test programs, support equipment, prime movers, generators, publi-cations and technical documentation, train-ing equipment, spare and repair parts, per-sonnel training, Technical Assistance Field Team (TAFT), U.S. Government and con-tractor technical, engineering, and logistics support services, Systems Integration and Checkout (SICO), field office support, and other related elements of logistics and pro-gram support. The total estimated program cost is $3.5 billion. This proposed sale will contribute to the foreign policy and national security of the United States by improving the security of a key NATO Ally on the front lines of the fight against terrorism. Turkey is a member of and critical enabling platform for the De-feat-ISIS campaign and continues to be an essential element of our National Security Strategy and National Defense Strategy ef-forts to compete against great powers in both Europe and the Middle East. The TPY– 2 radar site that Turkey hosts is important to the European Phased Adaptive Approach and to efforts to protect Allies and partners against growing Iranian ballistic missile threats. This sale is consistent with U.S. ini-tiatives to provide key allies with modern systems capable of being networked to de-fend against regional instability. The pro-posed sale will enhance Turkey’s interoper-ability with the United States and NATO, making it a more valuable partner in an in-creasingly important area of the world. Turkey will use Patriot to improve its mis-sile defense capability, defend its territorial integrity, and deter regional threats. The proposed sale will increase the defensive ca-pabilities of the Turkey military to guard against hostile aggression and shield NATO Allies who might train and operate within Turkey’s borders. Turkey should have no dif-ficulty absorbing this system into its armed forces. The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not alter the basic military bal-ance in the region. The prime contractors will be Raytheon Corporation in Andover, Massachusetts, and Lockheed-Martin in Dallas, Texas. The pur-chaser requested offsets. At this time offset agreements are undetermined and will be de-fined in negotiations between the purchaser and contractors. Implementation of this proposed sale will require approximately 25 U.S. Government and 40 contractor representatives to travel to Turkey for an extended period for equip-ment de-processing/fielding, system check-out, training, and technical and logistics support. There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-fense readiness as a result of this proposed sale. TRANSMITTAL NO . 18–17 Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act Annex Item No. vii (vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 1. The Patriot Air Defense System con-tains classified CONFIDENTIAL hardware components, SECRET tactical software and CRITICAL/SENSITIVE technology. Patriot ground support equipment and Patriot mis-sile hardware contain CONFIDENTIAL com-ponents and the associated launcher hard-ware is UNCLASSIFIED. The items re-quested represent significant technological advances for Sweden Patriot. The Patriot Air Defense System continues to hold a sig-nificant technology lead over other surface- to-air missile systems in the world. 2. The Patriot sensitive/critical technology is primarily in the area of design and produc-tion know-how and primarily inherent in the design, development and/or manufacturing data related to certain components. The list of components is classified CONFIDENTIAL. 3. Information on system performance ca-pabilities, effectiveness, survivability, mis-sile seeker capabilities, select software/soft-ware documentation and test data are classi-fied up to and including SECRET. 4. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain knowledge of the hardware and software elements, the information could be used to develop countermeasures or equivalent systems which might reduce sys-tem effectiveness or be used in the develop-ment of a system with similar or advanced capabilities. 5. A determination has been made that Turkey can provide substantially the same degree of protection for the sensitive tech-nology being released as the U.S. Govern-ment. This sale is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and national secu-rity objectives outlined in the Policy Jus-tification. 6. All defense articles and services listed in this transmittal have been authorized for re-lease and export to Turkey. 
CERTIFICATION PURSUANT TO §620C(D) OF THE  
FOREIGN ASSISTANCE ACT OF 1961 , AS AMENDED  Pursuant to Section 620C(d) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended (the Act), Executive Order 12163 and State Department Delegation of Authority No. 293–2, I hereby certify that the furnishing to Turkey of four Patriot systems is consistent with the prin-ciples contained in Section 620C(b) of the Act. This certification will be made part of the notification to Congress under Section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control Act, as amended, regarding the proposed sale of the above- named articles and services and is based on the justification accompanying such notifi-cation, of which such justification con-stitutes a full explanation.

NDREA THOMPSON , Under Secretary of State. f 
CONFIRMATION OF JOSEPH MAGUIRE Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wholeheartedly support the nomina-tion of VADM Joseph Maguire to be the Director of the National Counter-terrorism Center, NCTC. Had I been able to cast my vote today, it would have been to support this exceptional- nominee. The Director of the NCTC is one of the most important positions in the in-telligence community, especially at this critical juncture in our Nation’s history. Admiral Maguire has a long and impressive record of achievement and of service to his country, and I ap-plaud his willingness to once again re-turn to public service after completing a Navy career that spanned 36 years, including as the commander of Naval Special Warfare Command. The National Counterterrorism Cen-ter is the U.S. intelligence commu-nity’s premier organization for track-ing and countering the continuing threat from terrorism. Our country still has men and women on the frontlines in the fight against extrem-ist groups, and they must get it right each hour of every day to ensure the safety and security of their fellow Americans. As Admiral Maguire and I have dis-cussed, our counterterrorism capabili-ties are greatly strengthened by our re-lationships with the allies and partners with whom we have fought shoulder-to- shoulder since September 11, 2001, in this struggle. This is why it is impor-tant for the United States to hold onto and strengthen our traditional alli-ances such as NATO— and not to heed-lessly undermine them. I am satisfied by the ironclad com-mitments Admiral Maguire gave to the Senate Intelligence Committee during his confirmation hearing to ensuring that the men and women serving under him will always be empowered to as-sess and analyze intelligence free from political interference. He has also com-mitted to present these assessments to those in leadership positions free of any political considerations. In short, he has committed to ‘‘speak truth to power,’’ and I expect him to live up to these commitments. This is especially important at a time when we have sometimes seen those in power unjustifiably belittle and denigrate our Intelligence Commu-nity and law enforcement agencies. I trust that Admiral Maguire and those he leads at the NCTC will con-tinue to selflessly work day and night—whether on the 24/7 watch floor or on the front lines, to protect the United States and our allies from the terrorist threat. I salute him for step-ping up to this challenging task. f 
STRENGTHENING COASTAL COMMUNITIES ACT OF 2018 Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, today the Senate passed H.R. 5787, the Strengthening Coastal Communities Act of 2018, by unanimous consent. This legislation adds new acres to the Coastal Barrier Resources System, which Congress established through bi-partisan legislation in 1982. I yield to my distinguished colleague, the Senator from Delaware, ranking member of the Environment and Public Works Committee. Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague, the Sen-ator from Wyoming, chairman of the Environment and Public Works Com-mittee. The Coastal Barrier Resources

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES7914 December 19, 2018 
Act is an important, free-market con-servation tool that does not regulate how people develop their land, but transfers the full cost of developing in risky, environmentally sensitive areas from taxpayers to the individual choos-ing to develop. The Coastal Barrier Re-sources System also provides much- needed habitat for our Nation’s treas-ured wildlife, including federally threatened Red Knot birds in Delaware. H.R. 5787 adds approximately 18,000 acres along the Delaware, North Caro-lina, South Carolina, and Florida coasts to the Coastal Barrier Resources System, protecting these barrier is-lands, beaches, wetlands, and aquatic habitat from federally funded develop-ment. H.R. 5787 also corrects an error that placed part of Bethany Beach, in my great State of Delaware, within the Coastal Barrier Resources System. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service discov-ered this error during a Coastal Barrier Resources System digital mapping pilot project, which Congress directed the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to undertake in 2000. Digital mapping has enabled the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to greatly improve mapping accuracy as the Serv-ice updates outdated maps and makes determinations about whether prop-erties fall inside or outside the Coastal Barrier Resources System. However, as our colleagues in the U.S. House of Representatives drafted H.R. 5787, con-cerns arose regarding the security and permanency of digital maps. To address these concerns, the U.S. House of Representatives included sec-tion 3 in H.R. 5787. However, this legis-lation is not intended to prevent the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service from using various digital tools, digital data, and digital maps to help imple-ment the Coastal Barrier Resources Act. I would ask if my distinguished col-league, the Senator from Wyoming, chairman of the Environment and Pub-lic Works Committee, could confirm my understanding about the use of dig-ital maps under H.R. 5787? Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, the Senator from Delaware is correct about this use of digital maps. Under H.R. 5787, Congress does not intend to pre-vent the use of these tools or data to assist in the implementation of the Coastal Barrier Resources Act. Con-gress intends to ensure the integrity of the system maps and the rule of law. Congress intends that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service be permitted to continue to make determinations as to whether a location is inside or outside of the Coastal Barrier Resources Sys-tem with the assistance of Geographic Information Systems and any digital boundary data that were used to create the Coastal Barrier Resources System maps. In cases where properties or project sites are located close to a system boundary, due to the scale of the offi-cial maps or age of the underlying base maps, the assistance of various digital tools and data may be needed in order to ensure that the U.S. Fish and Wild-life Service makes accurate determina-tions. Congress intends that those de-terminations are based on a printed, hard copy version of an applicable dig-ital map. Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his confirmation of my understanding. In conclusion, I also want to thank my colleague for work-ing with me and all of our colleagues to enact this bipartisan legislation into law. During a time of frequent partisan gridlock, I am proud of the work of the U.S. Senate Committee on Environ-ment and Public Works for shepherding agreement on many important issues, including this one. Thank you.

TRIBUTE TO ORRIN HATCH Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to my colleague Senator O
RRIN HATCH and his more than 40 years of public service. Only five U.S. Senators have served longer than Senator H
ATCH , and he is one of the few who have served as President Pro Tempore of the Senate, an honor given to the longest serving Member of the majority party. Some may not know this, but O
RRIN HATCH was born and raised in Pittsburgh, PA. He at-tended the University of Pittsburgh Law School and practiced law in the city before moving to Utah years be-fore his election to the Senate. Senator H
ATCH has too many legisla-tive accomplishments to list, but I will focus on one that is so important to our family, the Children’s Health In-surance Program. Nelson Mandela once said, ‘‘There can be no keener revela-tion of a society’s soul than the way in which it treats its children.’’ The Chil-dren’s Health Insurance program, known by the acronym CHIP, is a prime example of when our Nation took an important step forward to care for our children. Senator H
ATCH  worked with our former colleague Sen-ator Ted Kennedy and others to ensure that children from low-income families who were not eligible for Medicaid had access to healthcare. CHIP holds a spe-cial place in my heart as well because my father, Governor Robert P. Casey, signed into law one of the first chil-dren’s health insurance programs in the Nation in 1992. Pennsylvania’s CHIP served as the model for the na-tional program that today provides healthcare to nearly 10 million chil-dren. We will miss Senator H
ATCH here, but he leaves the Senate knowing that his work has positively impacted the lives of millions of Americans. We wish Sen-ator O
RRIN HATCH well as he returns to Utah. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO BILL NELSON Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to my colleague, Senator BILLNELSON , who will leave the Senate after 18 years of service in the Senate and over 40 years as a pub-lic official in the State of Florida. Abigail Adams once asked, ‘‘If we do not lay out ourselves in the service of mankind whom should we serve?’’ Throughout his career, Senator N
ELSON  worked to make life better for the peo-ple of Florida and the United States. Florida and Pennsylvania share a dis-tinction in having among the largest percentage of seniors in their States and therefore millions of Medicare beneficiaries. Through his work on the Finance Committee, Senator N
ELSON  pushed to guarantee that Medicare pro-vided quality care to our seniors and people with disabilities. Senator N
EL-
SONworked every day to ensure that our government kept the original promise President Johnson made in 1965 to guarantee quality, affordable healthcare for beneficiaries. Florida has a coastline of 1,350 miles, and B
ILLNELSON understood that the beaches and the oceans needed to be protected from offshore drilling and pollution. Current and future genera-tions of Floridians and others who visit the State will enjoy the benefits of Senator N
ELSON ’s work in fighting to maintain and enhance those protec-tions. Senator N
ELSON has also been a lead-er in the areas of science and space. As a former astronaut who journeyed into space in 1986 on the space shuttle Co-lumbia, Senator N
ELSON understood the importance of exploration and dis-covery and never stopped imagining what is possible. We will miss Senator N
ELSON in this Chamber, and we thank him for his decades of service on behalf of the peo-ple of Florida and our Nation. We have no doubt that he will continue to find ways to make a difference and serve our country in the years ahead.

LAKE has a strong record of supporting democracy at home and abroad, finding areas of compromise on difficult issues like immigration re-form and making sure our Nation keeps its promise to veterans. Senator F
LAKE has been a leader on immigra-tion reform efforts, and he has worked tirelessly to find a path forward to ad-dress the needs of our immigration sys-tem. In 2013, Senator F
LAKE was one of the lead authors of bipartisan immigra-tion reform legislation that would have modernized our immigration system, secured our borders, and provided a tough but fair path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants in our coun-try. Through his position in the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, Sen-ator F
LAKE has advocated for policies

that promote democracy, economic growth, and quality of life improve-ments for people around the world. Here at home, Senator F
LAKE has helped veterans in Arizona receive as-sistance and recognition from the Fed-eral Government. In recent years, J
EFFFLAKE has been a leading voice in speaking up for the institution of the Senate and its role as part of a coequal branch of government with the executive’ branch. He has sought to hold Presidents of both par-ties accountable as a Member of the Senate. We will miss Senator F
LAKE in the Senate next year, but I have no doubt that he will continue to find ways to serve his State and our Nation in the years ahead. We wish him well in that endeavor.

TRIBUTE TO BOB CORKER Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to my colleague Senator B
OBCORKER , who will be retir-ing from the Senate this year. Senator C
ORKER and I were both elected in 2006. He was the only Republican in a class of 10 new Senators. Through his years of service on the Foreign Relations Committee, most re-cently as its chairman, B
OBCORKER  worked to build a better world. For ex-ample, Senator C
ORKER worked with me and several of his Republican col-leagues on global food security. Sen-ator C
ORKER worked with Senator I
SAKSON and me to pass the Global Food Security Act in 2016. This bill, first introduced by Senator Lugar of Indiana in 2008, allowed us to take a more strategic approach to foreign as-sistance and how we help to combat poverty and hunger around the world. Senator C
ORKER ’s work played an im-portant role in creating a better future for millions around the world. As he retires from the Senate, we thank B
OBCORKER for his years of serv-ice and his commitment to the idea that America should be a force for good in the world.

TRIBUTE TO CLAIRE McCASKELL Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to my colleague, C
LAIRE MCCASKILL . CLAIRE and I came to the Senate together in January 2007, and she has served the people of Mis-souri and the United States with dis-tinction for the past 12 years. Former Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis once remarked, ‘‘Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants.’’ When I consider C
LAIRE ’s service and her work on both the Special Com-mittee on Aging and the Homeland Se-curity and Government Affairs Com-mittee, I am reminded of Justice Brandeis’s words. Senator M
CCASKILL  was tireless in her efforts to shed light on policies and practices that hurt sen-iors, veterans, and the vulnerable in our Nation. For example, Senator M
CCASKILL has been a strong advocate of empowering veterans, giving them a voice, and holding the VA accountable through the Veterans’ Customer Satisfaction Program she designed. This program allows veterans to provide anonymous feedback on their healthcare treatment at VA facilities across the country. Senator MCCASKILL has also been a champion for seniors. She used her po-sition on the Special Committee on Aging to investigate fraudulent Medi-care bills and an IRS-impersonation scheme to ensure seniors have access to quality healthcare and a financially stable retirement. I had the honor of succeeding her as ranking member of the Aging Committee and have worked to continue her focus on protecting seniors from scam artists. Finally, Senator M
CCASKILL ’s work on the Victims Protection Act of 2014 is a shining example of her commit-ment to protecting the wellbeing of our servicemembers who have endured the horror of sexual assault in the mili-tary. When many in power choose to stand down, C
LAIRE stands up for sur-vivors. The Senate, and especially the class of 2006, will miss Senator C
LAIRE  M
CCASKILL in this Chamber, but I have no doubt that she will find a way to use her extraordinary skills to help those who are powerless. Thank you, C
LAIRE , for your years of public service.

TRIBUTE TO DEAN HELLER Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, today I wish to speak about my colleague, Sen-ator D
EANHELLER , who will leave the Senate at the end of this year after more than a decade of combined serv-ice in the House of Representatives and the Senate. During this time, D
EAN HELLER has worked to guarantee that our veterans have what they need when they return home. As a member of the Veterans Af-fairs Committee, Senator H
ELLER  worked to increase access to care for veterans and fought to guarantee that the Veterans Administration provides high-quality services across Nevada’s widespread rural communities. I worked with Senator H
ELLER to reduce the VA disability claims backlog and improve accountability at the Veterans Administration. We thank Senator H
ELLER for his service in the Senate and know he will continue to find ways to serve the peo-ple of Nevada. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO JOE DONNELLY Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to my colleague, Senator J
OEDONNELLY , who will leave the Senate at the end of this year. Dur-ing his time in the U.S. Senate, Sen-ator D
ONNELLY has worked tirelessly for our seniors, our servicemembers and middle-class families in Indiana and across our country. I have had the pleasure of serving be-side Senator D
ONNELLY on the Special Committee on Aging, where I have wit-nessed his dedication to protecting the rights of older Americans. Senator DONNELLY has worked to protect Medi-care, to guarantee senior citizens’ healthcare options are not restricted. Senator D
ONNELLY and I also served together on the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry where he introduced the Federal Water Quality Protection Act to protect the interest of our farmers by requiring the EPA to consult with them to ensure every American has access to clean water. Senator D
ONNELLY ’s dedication to our servicemen and women was second to none. The first bill he introduced as a U.S. Senator, the Sexton Act, has im-proved mental health services by re-quiring all Active servicemembers re-ceive a yearly mental health screening. I will miss working with J
OEDON-
NELLY in the next Congress, but I am certain he will continue to find a way to serve the people of Indiana and our Nation in the years ahead. We wish him well in those endeavors.

TRIBUTE TO HEIDI HEITKAMP Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to my colleague, Senator H
EIDI HEITKAMP , who will be leaving the Senate at the end of this year. During her time in the U.S. Sen-ate, H
EIDI never failed to remind us that we are blessed to serve here, to help others, and move our Nation for-ward. As a member of the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, Senator H
EITKAMP worked tirelessly on the farm bill, making sure it included provisions such as crop insurance to as-sure continuity of the quality Amer-ican agricultural products. Through her service on the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, Senator H
EITKAMP worked across the aisle, delivering bipartisan housing fi-nance legislation that protects Ameri-cans from financial crises and pre-serves 30-year fixed mortgage rates. Through her work on the Indian Af-fairs Committee, Senator H
EITKAMP  has been a champion for Native Amer-ican and women’s rights. She created a commission on Native children to ad-dress many of the challenges faced by Native American communities, includ-ing access to healthcare and education. In order to combat human trafficking and violence against women, Senator H
EITKAMP introduced Savanna’s Act to create a platform for data collection and sharing for best-practice response protocols. Through her work on the Small Busi-ness and Entrepreneurship Committee, Senator H
EITKAMP promoted investing in small business to boost the Amer-ican economy. One example is the SEED Act, which she introduced to in-crease early stage investment to foster the growth of small businesses and startups.

RIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM  
REVISED AND AMENDED FIRST STEP ACT TO BE  
INTRODUCED NEXT WEEK  Chuck Canterbury, National President of the Fraternal Order of Police, announced his support today for legislation developed by the Administration to make important re-forms to our nation’s criminal justice sys-tem. ‘‘The President and his team have been working hard on this issue since Inaugura-tion Day,’’ Canterbury said. ‘‘From the out-set, they let us know they wanted our input because this effort could not succeed without our support. We are proud to announce that by working together with the Administra-tion and leaders on Capitol Hill we have a bill that will make our streets and neighbor-hoods safer, our police will be better pro-tected and improve the ability of our crimi-nal justice system to effectively rehabilitate offenders.’’ The legislation, entitled the ‘‘First Step Act,’’ would establish a comprehensive risk and needs assessment tool to provide an indi-vidual profile of all Federal inmates. Those offenders deemed to be at low risk to recidivate would be given incentives and ac-cess to evidence-based recidivist reduction programs to better prepare them to return to their neighborhoods and become productive members of the community. ‘‘By individually targeting those offenders with the lowest risk to re-offend, law en-forcement and correctional officers can bet-ter focus their resources,’’ Canterbury ex-plained. ‘‘The FOP played a key role in mak-ing sure that truly dangerous offenders, like those who commit crimes while armed and those who traffic in deadly narcotics like fentanyl, are ineligible to participate in the First Step program.’’ The legislation also contains certain sen-tencing reforms. The FOP engaged with our allies on Capitol Hill to make sure these changes are prospective and would not, ex-cept in the case of the existing Fair Sen-tencing Act, be applied retroactively. The bill also contains an FOP-backed provision that would improve the safety of our Federal correctional officers carrying firearms under the auspices of the Law Enforcement Offi-cers’ Safety Act. ‘‘We have been proud to be a partner in this effort with President Trump and are grateful for his leadership and for his con-stant and unwavering support for law en-forcement,’’ Canterbury said. ‘‘We look for-ward to working with him and with Congress to get this bill to his desk.’’ The Fraternal Order of Police is the larg-est law enforcement labor organization in the United States with more than 345,000 members.

ONALD J. T RUMP , The White House, Washington, DC. D
EAR PRESIDENT TRUMP : On behalf of the International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP), the world’s largest organization of law enforcement executives, I am writing in support of the updated version of the First Step Act. We applaud you and your Adminis-tration for your commitment to law enforce-ment and to making lasting reforms to our criminal justice system. As you are aware, the IACP was supportive of the originally introduced First Step Act, but did have some feedback on changes that would further enhance the legislation. Your Administration worked with the IACP throughout this process to solicit our feed-back and we applaud both you and your Ad-ministration for ensuring that this legisla-tion achieves a proper balance of maintain-ing public safety while providing rehabilita-tion services and early release incentives to qualified federal prisoners. The First Step Act contains several meas-ures intended to more effectively rehabili-tate prisoners so that they are less likely to reoffend after release and, thereby, are less likely to cause additional harm to society. These measures include education, job train-ing, and other personal development pro-grams, along with incentives, such as good time credits, to participate in these opportu-nities. The proposed legislation includes an expanded list of 49 convictions that would ensure that truly dangerous offenders are in-eligible to receive time credits. In addition, the IACP is also pleased that the revised leg-islation contains provisions that ensure that certain sentencing reform provisions, unre-lated to the Fair Sentencing Act, can only be applied prospectively thereby achieving the proper balance between reform and main-taining public safety. Once introduced in the Senate, the IACP looks forward to working with Congress to continue to fine tune the legislation. A key item that we would like to see addressed is a notification system that will alert state and local law enforcement agencies and their communities when a rehabilitated offender is released into their jurisdiction. Ensuring proper notification will enable law enforce-ment and our communities to be aware when a rehabilitated offender returns. Addition-ally, while the IACP agrees that a portion of the savings associated with the reduction in recidivism resulting from this legislation be invested back into the Bureau of Prisons to continue evidence-based recidivism reduc-tion programs, it is also essential that a por-tion of the savings be invested back into fed-eral, state, and local law enforcement. In addition, further enhancements could be made to the safety valve language. Before being eligible for any safety valve provision, it is imperative that all pertinent informa-tion and most importantly, information from local authorities be reviewed. The facts and circumstances of the original sen-tencing, including a review of any prior criminal conduct or any other relevant infor-mation from federal, state and local authori-ties should be considered before a determina-tion is made regarding a reduction in sen-tence. Finally, and most importantly, the IACP is pleased with the acknowledgement and com-mitment from the Administration that there is a true need to establish a National Com-mission on Law Enforcement and the Admin-istration of Justice (Commission) to examine criminal justice issues in a broader and more strategic fashion. While the First Step Act aims to provide a solution to one of the many issues we are currently facing, it is not the ultimate fix to the multitude of issues confronting the criminal justice system. To move forward in a systematic way that pro-vides cross-cutting solutions for multiple disciplines and issues, we need the Commis-sion to serve as the catalyst for a long over-due strategic blueprint. Again, we appreciate the commitment from the White House to work towards the Commission’s establish-ment, which has been one of the IACP’s top priorities for more than two decades. On behalf of our more than 30,000 members, thank you again for working with the IACP on this important issue. We look forward to continuing to work together as this legisla-tion moves through the process. Sincerely, P
AULM. C ELL, IACP President.

EARMR. PRESIDENT : On behalf of the Na-tional Organization of Black Law Enforce-ment Executives (NOBLE), our Executive Board, local chapters, and members, I am writing to express support for the FIRST STEP Act (S. 2795/H.R. 5682). We applaud the White House and Congress for soliciting feed-back from NOBLE and the law enforcement community in finalizing the content of this very important legislation. We feel the FIRST STEP Act strikes a balance between maintaining public safety while improving re-entry, rehabilitation, workforce training programs, and sentencing. It is NOBLE’s hope that this legislation strengthens bi-partisan efforts in reforming this nation’s criminal justice system to en-sure equity in the administration of justice. Our organization joins many law enforce-ment leaders in the belief that America can reduce incarceration levels while also reduc-ing crime. Lastly, we encourage the White House and Congress to continue to explore the estab-lishment of a National Criminal Justice Commission. The purpose of this commission would be to undertake a comprehensive re-view of the criminal justice system. We thank all parties who helped in the de-velopment of the FIRST STEP Act (S. 2795/ H.R. 5682) and look forward to working col-laboratively in ensuring equal protection under the law for all Americans. Sincerely, V

prison and sentencing reform together is vital to keeping our nation safe. First, I wanted to share our briefing memo explaining how the FIRST STEP Act and sentencing reform will improve public safe-ty. Americans trust us, as law enforcement officers, to both secure the safety of their communities and advise policymakers on how to advance that goal. We hope this in-formation helps ease any concerns sur-rounding the bill Our position is also in line with that of the Fraternal Order of Police, which recently endorsed bipartisan efforts toward justice reform. Second, I wanted to share our previous let-ter supporting the FIRST STEP Act and sen-tencing reform sent to leaders in Congress, explaining the necessity of passing sen-tencing and prison reform together to reduce recidivism and increase fairness. Over 60 of our members signed onto this letter, writing everywhere from Virginia to New Orleans to Iowa, to share their views. I have expressed similar views in the The Hill, with Wash-ington Police Chief Peter Newsham. We are grateful for your unwavering lead-ership in prioritizing public safety and the critical issues facing law enforcement. I hope we can work together toward bipartisan re-forms.

ONALD J. T RUMP , The White House, Washington, DC. D
EAR PRESIDENT TRUMP : On behalf of the National District Attorneys Association (NDAA), the largest prosecutor organization in the country representing 2,500 elected and appointed District Attorneys as well as 40,000 Assistant District Attorneys, who collec-tively prosecute around 95 percent of the crime in the United States, I write to sup-port the revised First Step Act. This legisla-tion is a bipartisan effort to address front- end sentencing reform and back-end prison reform, and our association is appreciative of your efforts to partner with the Nation’s prosecutors on this important matter. NDAA previously supported the Sen-tencing Reform & Corrections Act (SRCA) during the last Congress as a carefully craft-ed bipartisan compromise. After weeks of discussions with White House and Senate Ju-diciary Committee staff, our organization is confident that the revised First Step Act strikes an appropriate balance between ad-dressing the needs of the current Federal prison population while ensuring criminals are penalized appropriately. Tasked with the constitutional duty of protecting the communities we serve from bad actors while seeking justice for victims of crime and protecting the innocent, our members are acutely aware of the need for reforms to our criminal justice system. As currently written, the revised First Step Act includes much needed prison reform provi-sions that will provide the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) with the guidance and resources to as-sist in lowering recidivism rates for low-risk prisoners. Further, the addition of four sen-tencing reform provisions takes a precision- like approach to sentencing guidelines asso-ciated with certain crimes. Absent meaning-ful sentencing reform, where the truly dan-gerous are locked up for an appropriate pe-riod of time and those with addiction or mental health issues have the chance for treatment and rehabilitation, rising recidi-vism rates will continue to persist. While the legislation makes its way to the Senate, NDAA plans to continue engaging with your staff and law enforcement stake-holders to improve the language in the re-vised First Step Act. Specifically, our orga-nization is working to ensure any reinvest-ment of savings generated because of front- end sentencing reform provisions is invested back into state and local law enforcement and prosecutor agencies to prevent crime, target drug trafficking operations, train law enforcement and prosecutors in the field and respond to other emerging issues within the criminal justice system. Our members continue to call for a new commission to explore issues across the criminal justice system to ensure law en-forcement and prosecutors can protect the communities they serve and respond to emerging issues in the field. In partnership with your administration, we hope to make that call a reality. As part of that commis-sion, it is imperative that the local pros-ecutor perspective is represented as the legal end of the criminal justice system con-tinuum. Without it, a comprehensive review of the broader stakeholder system is incom-plete. NDAA looks forward to having one of our members bring the state and local pros-ecutor’s valuable perspective to the table once the commission is established. We appreciate your efforts, as well as the efforts of a bipartisan group of Members of Congress and staff, to ensure the American criminal justice system is continually im-proved upon and seen as a model for innova-tive and cutting-edge programming that we see in our own members’ offices every day. Thank you for working with the Nation’s prosecutors and NDAA on this historic ef-fort. Sincerely, JONATHAN BLODGETT , President. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, this week, with my support, the Senate passed the FIRST STEP Act of 2018. This is a groundbreaking step toward long overdue criminal justice reform in our country. Too many people have un-necessarily spent decades behind bars for nonviolent offenses or because of disproportionately harsh mandatory minimum sentences. When these indi-viduals are finally released, if ever, they are met with loads of challenges stemming from the lack of rehabilita-tive help available before and after their release. The FIRST STEP Act begins to ad-dress these issues. It allows for less prison time for nonviolent offenders, reduces harsh mandatory minimums, works to eliminate some racial dispari-ties in sentencing, provides for mean-ingful education and job-training pro-grams for inmates, and raises the chances that the incarcerated return to society for good. In short, this legisla-tion is an important and overdue course correction from laws that, for years, created and amplified serious in-equities in our criminal justice system. However, the FIRST STEP Act is not perfect. I would like to offer a few thoughts on a particular component of the legislation. This legislation re-quires that the Attorney General de-velop what is called an evidence-based risk and needs assessment tool. If all goes right, it will be a data-driven soft-ware program designed to help incar-cerated individuals reintegrate into so-ciety upon release. This tool is in-tended to take into account a person’s ability to earn time off their sentence, how likely a person is to reoffend, their most effective treatment plan, access to resources like educational and work programs, and their housing assign-ment after release. I am fully in support of fresh ideas. Ones that can help individuals reenter society are important and this bill con-tains a lot of them. But the fact is, some existing software programs, simi-lar to the one proposed in this legisla-tion, have been plagued by racial and class bias. Inherently biased software and algorithms can harm the vulner-able, especially if they are not de-ployed and monitored carefully. Over-sight is necessary to ensure the FIRST STEP Act reforms, once implemented, do not inadvertently establish a new form of the same old discrimination. Some safeguards have been put in place to ensure this software is devel-oped without those biases. That in-cludes establishing specific trans-parency requirements and an inde-pendent review committee made up of experts to advise the process. The rest is up to oversight. I am committed to closely monitoring how these reforms are implemented and put into practice. Given the broad support this legisla-tion has on both sides of this body, I am hopeful that Democrats and Repub-licans alike will be able to work to-gether to ensure it is implemented the right way. Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I wish to voice my concern over the passage of the FIRST STEP Act, a bill that would reduce prison sentences for some Federal offenders, and to explain to the public why I did not vote for the bill. First, I want to say that I agree with some of the provisions of the act. For too long, we have been putting low-level drug offenders behind bars for exorbitant periods of time, without a focus on rehabilitation. This has ruined lives, irrevocably damaged our commu-nities, and cost the taxpayer dearly. I support data-driven antirecidivism programs. I support helping people who have served their time to lead produc-tive lives. I support using our prisons as a place to punish violent perpetra-tors and serious drug offenders. But this bill simply goes too far for the people of my State. What is hap-pening currently in Alaska should serve as an example of the negative consequences resulting from a far- reaching criminal justice reform bill. Let me spend a few minutes talking about Alaska’s experience with crimi-nal justice reform. In 2016, then Governor Walker signed into a law a criminal reform bill, known in Alaska as SB91. The bill was similar to many similar bills passed in 30 States across the country. It was more sweeping than the Fed-eral bill we are debating today, but it has served as a model for this Federal bill in front of us.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES7918 December 19, 2018 
Its main focus was on antirecidivism measures and reserving prison space for the truly dangerous criminals while showing leniency for certain ‘‘low-risk offenders,’’ just as the FIRST STEP Act does. In some States, it has worked well, and I hope that the FIRST STEP Act works as those who supported it be-lieve it will, but I am not convinced be-cause, in my State, it hasn’t. Our criminal reform law hit Alaska right as we were going through a reces-sion caused by low oil prices and the fact that the Obama administration locked up Alaska lands which hurt thousands of working men and women and their families. It was also during this time that the opioid and drug crisis hit our State. Like many States across our country, my State has been hit hard, and we have been laser focused on it here in this body. This trifecta—the passage of the State’s criminal reform bill, a per-sistent recession, and the drug crisis— have resulted in mayhem in some of our communities in Alaska. In Alaska, all crime is up 6 percent from last year and up 26 percent from 5 years ago. Let me give you some troubling statistics from Alaska’s Uni-form Crime Report: violent crime; up 6 percent from last year and up 35 per-cent from 5 years ago; property crime; up 5 percent from last year and up 23 percent from 5 years ago; and vehicle theft up 39 percent from 2016 to 2017. According Kyle Hopkins from the An-chorage Daily News, who has done a great job reporting on this; car thieves, burglars, and shoplifters stole a stag-gering $45.3 million worth of property across Anchorage in 2017. Remember, Anchorage is a city of a population of less than 300,000—the number of cars stolen in Anchorage: 3,104 in 2017; the number of vehicle break-ins: 3,837 in 2017. Much of this crime is fueled by the drug epidemic. Like many States across the coun-try, Alaska has been reeling from the opioid crisis and drug epidemic. Trag-ically, lives are being lost because of this epidemic. Opioid-related deaths doubled in Alaska in 2017. Fentanyl re-lated deaths rose by 450 percent. The amount of heroin seized in Alas-ka more than doubled in 2017, while the number of arrests actually decreased. Law enforcement has been tracking lower 48 traffickers who continue to import increasing amounts of these drugs to take advantage of our unique enforcement challenges, especially in our rural communities. Given the crime wave in my State, in many cases fueled by addictions, and our high rates of sexual assault and do-mestic violence, many of the provi-sions in this bill are deeply trouble-some. In the FIRST STEP Act, certain sex-ual and drug criminals could be eligible for expanded good time credits, mean-ing that they can get out of prison early. Criminals who are serving prison time for trafficking cocaine, heroin, or meth could get out early, so could those who assaulted a law enforcement officer and those who have committed certain violent assaults. Perhaps most troubling, this bill would reduce enhanced sentencing for repeat drug offenders, including for methamphetamine, heroin, and fentanyl, three drugs that are more prevalent in my State. The recent statistics in Alaska on drug seizures paint a grim picture about our drug crisis in my State. I cannot risk allowing these perpetra-tors, some of whom might make their way to Alaska, such leniency. As I have said, we have been laser-fo-cused on this drug issue here in the Senate. We have passed numerous bills to bring more resources to our States, billions of dollars of resources. Back home, I have held numerous summits relating to this issue. In August 2016, I convened the Alaska Wellness Summit: Conquering the Opioid Crisis, an important gathering of Federal, State, and local community leaders dedicated to tackling the many challenges associated with the growing opioid and heroin epidemic. That sum-mit, which largely focused on issues of addiction, recovery, and community, was very productive, with hundreds of Alaskans gathering to listen, gain in-spiration, learn and exchange ideas. Federal officials from several different agencies attended to hear the many ob-stacles Alaskans face when in recovery, as well as witness the indomitable spir-it of Alaskans who have overcome those obstacles. In August 2018, I held another wellness summit, this time focused not only on Alaska’s addiction epidemic, but on drug trafficking and the associ-ated crime wave that is victimizing so many Alaskans. The summit once again feature a prominent group of Federal, State, and local leaders and stakeholders to build public awareness, identify opportunities for coordination and cooperation, and highlight Alas-ka’s unique public safety challenges with Federal officials. We have grassroots, peer-to-peer net-works across the State that are really beginning to make a difference. We also have very active community members who are banding together to try to fight crime in their neighbor-hoods. But we need a strong criminal justice system that continues to mete out punishments that fit the crime. We need, fair, strong deterrence. We need the full strength of both the Federal and the State governments, working in tandem, to get drug dealers off the streets and punish violent re-offenders who are wreaking havoc in our communities. Although I respect that motives of my colleagues—and I do believe that some reform is necessary—this bill goes too far. When evaluating this bill, I could not ignore the realities of my State’s cur-rent situation: spiking crime rates and an ongoing opioid and drug crisis. Vot-ing to lessen prison time for any con-tributing offenders could compound the problem. I could not take that risk.

AGRICULTURE IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2018 Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, the 2018 farm bill was a true bipartisan vic-tory, and I am very proud of the his-toric vote Senator R
OBERTS and I were able to achieve on this bill. It serves as an example of how Congress, on a bi-partisan basis, can produce important legislation through debate and com-promise. On the Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee, we have a long history of working together to en-sure a strong safety net for farmers and for families. This bill continues that long-standing, bipartisan tradi-tion. I know that the chairman did not get everything he wanted in this bill, and neither did I. I would have pre-ferred to make more progress on re-forming farm payments, a cause cham-pioned by my friend, Senator G
RASS -
LEY, and on improving the adequacy of benefits in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, and our other food assistance pro-grams, but, overall, this is a good bill that protects and advances many crit-ical food and farm policies that de-serves the strong bipartisan support it received. The nutrition title of this bill is no exception. We know that SNAP is largely working, and spending has been declining as more people get back to work and get off SNAP the right way. We also know that it is our job to make sure the program is working as intended and that we address any in-tegrity issues that arise. That is why we included important improvements to SNAP program operations, over-sight, and employment and training in this bill. In this conference report, we have protected SNAP, made modest, but important improvements, and ex-cluded the very harmful House provi-sions that would have cut SNAP by more than $20 billion over 10 years, taken food assistance away from at least 2 million people, and imposed new, unworkable mandates on States. I wish we also could have made more progress in expanding SNAP eligibility, benefits, and access in ways that would address food insecurity and help low- income Americans who are struggling to make ends meet. That said, we were able to include an important benefit improvement that will provide addi-tional SNAP benefit to certain home-less households that, despite lacking a permanent nighttime address, may still incur expenses for shelter for tem-porary accommodations or to stay with friends or family. The program’s $143 homeless shelter deduction will now be available in all States, including in my home State of Michigan, and will keep pace with inflation each year. If a

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S7919 December 19, 2018 
household could get more SNAP bene-fits by claiming the regular shelter de-duction, it must continue to be able to do so, but for the many households that have had difficulty proving the amount of their shelter expenses, this change will enhance their SNAP bene-fits and reduce paperwork for both the household and for State agencies. Spe-cifically, the conference report allows, for example, when a homeless house-hold incurs a cost for shelter, but does not have paperwork available to prove the expense, an eligibility worker to provide the standard homeless shelter deduction based on her or his assess-ment of the households’ claims about the expense. The worker can examine the totality of the household’s cir-cumstances and provide an appropriate deduction based on the information that is available. Another improvement we include in this conference agreement is a require-ment that USDA reassess the adequacy of SNAP’s Thrifty Food Plan, TFP, by 2022 and every 5 years subsequently. The TFP is the foundation for SNAP benefit levels and is meant to reflect the actual food costs that households face in obtaining a nutritionally ade-quate diet. In recent years, mounting research evidence has found that the TFP is out of step with actual food purchasing practices and nutritional recommendations and that, for the vast majority of households, SNAP benefits are inadequate when consid-ered in tandem with income that the household is assumed to have available for food. In part, the low SNAP bene-fits are a result of USDA in the past re-quiring that revisions not increase the cost of the TFP. Over many years, the factors behind food costs have evolved, i.e., purchasing and consumption pat-terns, dietary guidelines, women’s work patterns, and transportation costs. Our intention for the future is that USDA not be compelled to achieve a cost-neutral revision to the TFP, but that it bring to bear the best scientific evidence about the appropriate cost of a ‘‘thrifty,’’ but nutritionally adequate food basket. We recognize that this may mean that SNAP benefits need to be adjusted as a result of the reassess-ment. We also recognize that food insecu-rity is an ongoing issue amongst mili-tary families. While the conference re-port did not include a critical change I support related to the treatment of the Base Allowance for Housing in SNAP, I want to encourage USDA to look for ways to address military hunger. Spe-cifically, I ask that USDA designate an office or liaison within the Office of the Secretary of Agriculture to coordinate with Department of Defense to gather data about currently serving military families experiencing food insecurity. I would ask USDA to gather key infor-mation such as estimates of SNAP par-ticipation by currently serving mili-tary families; estimates of currently serving military families experiencing food insecurity, but not able to qualify for SNAP benefits because the inclu-sion of their Basic Allowance for Hous-ing allowance as counted income; esti-mates of currently serving military households with low household in-comes—below 200 percent of federal poverty line; below 185 percent; below 130 percent; and estimates of participa-tion in WIC by military households in comparison to SNAP. Food consumption and buying behav-iors are not the only changes affecting SNAP. Technology, both in administra-tion and in the retail landscape, also continue to evolve. The conference re-port makes several important changes to help USDA to modernize to address consumer preferences and to help States to continue to strengthen their stewardship of SNAP. First, we expand a pilot from the last farm bill, known as the National Accu-racy Clearinghouse, NAC, to be a na-tionwide program within a few years. The NAC gives States tools to ensure that individuals do not simultaneously receive SNAP benefits in two or more States by conducting cross-State matches of SNAP applicants and par-ticipating households and setting up a process for States to resolve instances of apparent dual participation. An evaluation of the NAC pilot found that, although duplicate participation is small—less than 0.02 percent of SNAP participants—it is feasible for States to conduct a match to identify and pre-vent duplicate participation. We know that duplicate participa-tion, when it does occur, is rarely in-tentional fraud, but rather is a result of a household or household member simply moving from one State to an-other and not successfully disenrolling in their previous home State. This could be caused by households not being able to get through to a call cen-ter to report the move or a State not taking the proper subsequent action to close the case or remove the household member. The NAC helps States to ad-dress this issue more effectively using technology, saving money within SNAP in the process. As with any error, without evidence of a client’s in-tent to defraud the program, States should assume that dual enrollment discovered through the NAC is uninten-tional. Because duplicate participation is so rare and a household’s need for food as-sistance may be urgent, the conference committee expects that USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service, FNS, and States will establish procedures for the NAC that will not interfere with current ap-plication and enrollment procedures, particularly the speedy processing of applications. Some States are able to process matches in ‘‘real time’’ or pro-vide same-day or other fast service to SNAP applicants. Given that only a tiny fraction of applications are ex-pected to result in a positive match via the NAC, we expect that States will often run the match after approving SNAP. In developing the NAC provision, the members were sensitive to recent prob-lems with data security breaches and the risk that any large data set may be a target for hacking, identity theft, or other ‘‘big data’’ goals that are not as-sociated with the administration of SNAP. The Conference Committee in-tended that the NAC have state-of-the art privacy and security protections and that the information shared across States as part of the NAC be used only for the purpose of identifying and pre-venting dual participation in SNAP. We expect FNS to exercise strong over-sight of any contractors that are en-gaged in the operation of the NAC to ensure that contractor is not using in-formation about SNAP participants for any other purposes. Finally, as part of the NAC, we ex-pect that FNS will be developing proce-dures for standardizing, streamlining, and in some cases automating cross- State communications. We urge FNS to ensure that these processes provide SNAP recipients with services that take into account the difficulty they may have in navigating cross-State communications. For example, we ex-pect FNS’s policies to include proce-dures to help households appeal and re-solve decisions across State bound-aries. If a noncustodial parent applies for benefits on behalf of a child who lives with the other parent, it may be difficult for the custodial parent to know how to navigate an eligibility de-cision made in another State where the individual does not reside. Similarly, when overpayments occur because of duplicate participation, we expect the cross-State claims process to take into account difficulties house-holds may have had in closing their case in their prior State of residence. For example, if a State was delinquent in closing the case after the household reported the change, or the household could not get through on the telephone to report the change because of a major problem in call center operations, this should be considered an agency error, and households should be given consid-eration in the claims establishment and collection process. If the household did not use the benefits in the State in which they previously resided because they were receiving SNAP where they live now and simply could not close their old case because of a problem with the States’ reporting procedures we assume they will not be held re-sponsible for repaying an overpayment. Another provision of the bill offers States an opportunity to collaborate with FNS to establish longitudinal data sets about SNAP participation. The goal of this provision is in some ways the opposite of the NAC. Where the NAC aims to share very specific identifying information about SNAP applicants and participants to prevent dual participation, the conference agreement specifically prohibits the longitudinal database from collecting or sharing any personal identifying in-formation. Instead, the information in these data sets will be used only for re-search purposes to study the character-istics of SNAP participants over time

and improve SNAP program oper-ations. Because most data that is available about SNAP participants looks just at 1 particular month, these data sets will fill in a gap in our under-standing of SNAP and allow States, FNS, and other researchers to learn about patterns of participation and other factors such as work experience and income volatility. The SNAP quality control, QC, sys-tem, which measures SNAP payment accuracy, has recently been the subject of oversight by USDA’s Office of In-spector General. The Senate Agri-culture Committee also held a hearing to review problems with the quality control system. This led FNS to con-duct a subsequent investigation and re-vise its guidance and processes. We ac-knowledge that FNS and States have made substantial progress in address-ing the problems these investigations exposed. The conference agreement re-quires FNS to issue regulations to cod-ify the quality control improvements and other changes in order to ensure the statistical validity of the measures the QC system produces. The conferees are not expecting any major changes in how the QC system measures payment error. We expect that the basic tenets of the quality control measures will re-main. For example, a payment error will be determined based on the out-come of the eligibility decision, rather than on the State’s procedural compli-ance, and that the certification and re-porting rules under State and Federal policy will be taken into account in as-sessing payment errors. The QC system needs to balance the twin goals of payment accuracy and program access. We urge FNS to not include changes to the QC system that would make it harder for individuals to participate in SNAP if they live in un-stable conditions as a result of them moving more often, do not have a per-manent address, or if they are likely to be more ‘‘error prone’’ because they have variable earnings that are more difficult for States to track. The conferees are aware that the OIG and USDA both identified uneven Fed-eral application and enforcement of quality control rules, as well as State practices, as an underlying cause of the problems identified in the investiga-tions and reviews. We expect that im-proving quality control reviews will in-volve a more rigorous Federal rereview and more consistent practices across FNS regions. The conferees chose not to include a House provision that would eliminate the quality control error tolerance threshold. Currently set at $37, this is the threshold below which error amounts do not count toward the State’s error rate. The threshold en-courages States to focus their efforts on larger, costlier errors. Minor mis-takes in calculating benefit amounts are not a threat to SNAP integrity and are understandable, given the vola-tility in the lives of many low-income households. If States were encouraged to increase their efforts to drive SNAP errors in every case to zero, some States experience shows they likely would respond by requiring more pa-perwork, which would be burdensome and inefficient. Finally, the conference report elimi-nated SNAP bonus payments to States out of concern that that they may have contributed to State practices that in-troduced bias into the quality control process. The conferees continue to think that customer service measures, such as measures of timeliness and pro-gram access, are important indicators of SNAP’s success, and we expect FNS to continue to measure and publish these data for all States and to empha-size their importance in conducting program oversight. The same is true for enforcing clear standards. We are concerned that FNS is not following its own guidance with respect to how it will follow up with states whose timeli-ness has fallen below established Fed-eral standards. This is important for the agency to address. Another provision involving program integrity involves when States may follow up with households to seek addi-tional information based on a data match. The provision identifies the cir-cumstances under which such follow up is allowed and when it is prohibited. The conferees intend this provision to codify FNS’s recent regulation of Janu-ary 6, 2017, at 7 C.F.R. 273.12(c)(3). We do not intend for USDA to issue any new regulation beyond simply the addi-tion of the new National Accuracy Clearinghouse to the list of matches that might require action. Another provision in the program in-tegrity area changes how SNAP bene-fits are treated when households have not accessed them recently. The provi-sion allows States to move SNAP bene-fits ‘‘offline’’ after 3 months of inac-tivity instead of 6 months and requires benefits be ‘‘expunged’’ or completely taken away after 9 months instead of 12 months. Because inactivity in house-holds’ SNAP accounts is often the re-sult of a misunderstanding, the provi-sion requires that households be noti-fied 30 days before benefits are sched-uled to be expunged and offer an oppor-tunity for the household to request that any benefits that have been moved offline be swiftly restored. On balance, my expectation is that this provision will improve households’ access to ben-efits because households will be better informed. In our negotiations on the SNAP pro-visions of the farm bill, the conferees spent substantial time debating the SNAP employment and training pro-gram and proposals to add require-ments in SNAP that would take food assistance away from households that fail to meet harsh work requirements. I am proud that this bill does not in-clude the House’s proposals to severely restrict waivers from the existing harsh 3-month time limit and the House bill’s new requirements that would have taken food assistance away from families with children and older adults who struggle to find work. This was no accident. The conferees rejected these proposals. In fact, the Senate re-soundingly rejected on a bipartisan basis an amendment that included many of these harsh changes. The ad-ministration should take note of this and follow congressional intent and not attempt to advance an inconsistent agenda through rulemaking that is not supported by the law we just passed. Rather than harsh new requirements, the conference agreement focused on helping families get back to work the right way. The conference agreement will strengthen State flexibility to de-sign employment and training systems that meet local workforce needs and labor market conditions. We added workforce partnership arrangements, which could involve private employers, trade groups that represent such em-ployers, or nonprofit organizations to the options available to States and in-dividuals for meeting SNAP employ-ment and training and work require-ments. We also focus additional fund-ing provided in the bill for employment and training on programs with a prov-en track record based on the pilots from the 2014 farm bill and on popu-lations that face substantial barriers, such as individuals who were incarcer-ated in the past, workers age 50 and older, and those at risk of multigenerational poverty. In order to help employment and training participants succeed in their placements, we now expect States to include case management as a compo-nent in all States’ employment and training programs. We envision that States will continue to have wide lati-tude in what counts as case manage-ment, and we intend that case manage-ment be a resource to employment and training participants, not an extra hoop for participants to comply with to satisfy their employment and training obligation. Not every participant will need case management, and not every component of a State’s employment and training program must offer case management. We also revise the job search component under employment and training to add a supervision re-quirement, but anticipate that States will be creative in developing innova-tive models for supervision that are not burdensome on participants, for ex-ample, by using technology to include online job search, or other automated and remote options. We recognize that States will need time to update their employment and training plans and build capacity to roll out new ap-proaches, so we expect FNS will pro-vide adequate time for States to transi-tion to compliance with the new re-quirements. I should note that, while self-initiated job search may no longer be a standalone component within em-ployment and training, it is not dis-allowed as a part of another compo-nent. For example, if a job training program offers 12 hours of job training and 8 hours of job search, this should

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S7921 December 19, 2018 
still be allowable under this change. The conference report also does not preclude self-initiated job search that is not specifically managed within the SNAP employment and training. The Agriculture Committee has a long history of bipartisan oversight of SNAP, and every farm bill includes provisions that strengthen SNAP by taking advantage of new technologies and other advancements in other areas of the human services field. This farm bill is no exception. For example, we include provisions to adjust SNAP’s electronic benefit transfer, EBT, pro-gram to account for new technologies like mobile and online payments and to add flexibility for farmers’ markets. While we recognize the need for SNAP to evolve to survive in the modern marketplace, it is equally important that we continue to maintain program integrity. The Secretary must main-tain the ability to monitor retailers and ensure they are not engaging in fraudulent activities. Retailers without a physical storefront may require new approaches to oversight, and FNS should continue to work with retailers and Congress to ensure appropriate controls are in place. EBT is a critical link in the SNAP program for delivering benefits to eli-gible families and our retailers, and EBT contractors are important part-ners. The Senate-passed farm bill in-cluded requirements on USDA and GAO to conduct broad reviews of SNAP EBT, including transfer-related fees, equipment issues, data security, and customer service, especially the unfor-tunate increased frequency of systems outages. We also required USDA to issue regulations and guidance on these issues based on the findings from the studies. Although we were not able to include these provisions in the final conference agreement, both USDA and GAO have the authority to engage in these activities without specific statu-tory direction, and I urge them to do so. Child support collections is another area where we determined that the proper course of action is for the Sec-retary to obtain more information. The House included a sweeping provision to require States to mandate cooperation with child support enforcement as a condition of SNAP eligibility. While we strongly support custodial and non-custodial parents financially sup-porting their children, we rejected the mandate out of concern that taking away food assistance would do more harm than good for children and that the mandate would be costly for States and the Federal Government. Instead, we direct the Secretary to collect evi-dence on the impact on families and children and the cost for States and the Federal Government. We also want information on the experiences in States that have adopted the mandate, those that rejected it, and on some of the practical issues such as how States guarantee a robust determination of good cause for noncompliance. It is key that the Secretary in carrying out this study collect information on those who would be dissuaded from participating in SNAP as a result of the mandate. Research on those who do not receive SNAP as a result of a policy change can be difficult to obtain, but because our concern about the provision relates to the impact on children whose par-ents are afraid to participate in SNAP because of a fear of domestic violence or out of other concerns about their re-lationship with another parent—for ex-ample, when grandparents care for grandchildren—the Secretary must seek to paint a full picture of the im-pact such a change would have on chil-dren. We also instruct the Secretary to examine what alternative options are available in this area that would achieve similar goals but without put-ting food assistance for children at risk. In addition to these critical issues within SNAP, I also want to note that we made some critical improvements to programs to support beginning and socially disadvantaged farmers, or-ganic producers and local food systems, including providing permanent manda-tory baseline funding. This important step will ensure these programs con-tinue to support the next generation of sustainable farmers. The conference re-port also directs Secretary to have the Agriculture Marketing Service and Rural Business Cooperative Service work together to implement the Local Agriculture Market Program, using the agencies’ respective structures and ex-pertise to deliver an effective program. One important aspect of the Local Ag-riculture Market Program is food safe-ty assistance, an area where the pri-mary expertise at USDA resides with- in the Agriculture Marketing Service. I would ask USDA to ensure food safety components of the Local Agriculture Market Program be coordinated be-tween the agencies, but be led by Agri-culture Marketing Service, who has the most expertise. This farm bill was truly historic, both in its broad level of bipartisan support and also in its steps toward supporting the great diversity of Amer-ican agriculture. I also believe it was noteworthy that we were able to over-come strong partisan attacks on food assistance to produce a bill in the bi-partisan tradition this committee maintains continues to protect the family safety net in a bipartisan way. I hope the administration follows our lead and rejects harmful attacks on food assistance for families needing short term support.

TRIBUTE TO DR. KATHLEEN HOGAN Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the service of Dr. Kathleen Hogan, the former Deputy Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency at the U.S. Department of Energy. Dr. Hogan’s distinguished career is a testament to the power of one public servant to deliver progress for the en-tire country. Over her years of Federal service, Dr. Hogan dedicated her considerable tal-ent to helping our country use energy more efficiently. Dr. Hogan appre-ciated the promise of energy efficiency, not only to address the climate threat, but also to reduce waste and save money for households and businesses

nationwide. She also appreciated the necessity of bringing government and the private sector together on solu-tions. At the Department of Energy, Dr. Hogan oversaw the Better Buildings Program, an initiative to encourage buildings to become 20 percent more ef-ficient by the end of the decade. The program was formally codified through legislation I introduced with Senator Kelly Ayotte in 2013. Its success, how-ever, is entirely the result of Dr. Ho-gan’s tenacity, persistence, and rare ability to forge partnerships beyond government. While at the Department, Dr. Hogan also forged robust appliance standards that save consumers more than $60 billion on their electricity bills annually. At the Environmental Protection Agency, Dr. Hogan spearheaded Energy Star, a voluntary program to promote efficiency in housing, industry, and a range of consumer products. Today, Energy Star is one of the most widely recognized consumer labels in America. Since 1992, the program has saved fami-lies and businesses over $450 billion and 3.5 trillion kilowatt-hours of elec-tricity. The legacy of Dr. Hogan’s public service is all around us: in the kitchens of millions of American households, on the factory floor of industrial plants, in the cleaner air our children breathe each day, and in the dozens of new partnerships between the Federal Gov-ernment and businesses from nearly every sector of the economy. We are deeply appreciative of Dr. Ho-gan’s contributions, and we wish her all the best in her next chapter. Above all, we thank her for a distinguished career of service to our country.

TRIBUTE TO DUSTY VAUGHAN Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the service of my longtime staff member and dear friend, Dusty Vaughan. After 14 years of service, he is turn-ing a new page in what has been an im-pressive and dedicated career of service to the people of Nebraska. Dusty was the first person I hired after I was elected to represent District 43 in the Nebraska State Legislature in 2004. He served in my legislative office for my entire time in the unicameral, first as my legislative aide and then as legal counsel of the Transportation and Telecommunication Committee, which I chaired for 6 years. As a state sen-ator, I relied on Dusty’s expertise to make the best possible decisions that improved our State and helped Nebras-ka’s families. Together we accomplished a lot. We got results and Dusty worked tirelessly to get the ‘‘big stuff’ done. Our proud-est achievement from our legislative days was securing the passage of LB 84, the Build Nebraska Act, which dedi-cated a quarter cent of every sales tax dollar to a new highway fund in the State of Nebraska. This was a policy change for the State and is viewed as a major policy accomplishment in the last 40 years. In 2012, after I was elected by the people of Nebraska to serve in this Chamber, one of my first decisions was to make Dusty my State director. In the years that followed, when I wasn’t here in Washington, I was likely trav-elling on the road with him across Ne-braska. From Scottsbluff to Omaha, we visited countless families, organiza-tions, schools, hospitals, and small businesses. I always enjoyed our many lunches, ice cream breaks, and discus-sions about everything from policy issues to our families. And we have cer-tainly had a lot of laughs—and a few tears—over these many years. Each and every day Dusty brought unmatched integrity and heart to work with him. He is a wonderful example of the true goodness of the State of Ne-braska. I want to thank Dusty’s fam-ily, his wife, Julie, two sons Gabe and Kellen, and his two beautiful daugh-ters, Tatum and Zoe, who lent much of his time, including some busy week-ends. I know they are proud of him, as I am. Dusty has shown them what it means to be a true humble servant of our State. Dusty, I thank you for your posi-tivity, your loyalty, your friendship, and your faith in Nebraskans. I wish you the very best on this next chapter of your career, and I know you will continue to get the big stuff done and make us proud. f 
TRIBUTE TO KERRY GARLAND Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that my office says goodbye to Kerry Garland, who has been such an asset to my team this past year. Kerry has lived in Alaska for 18 years. She went to high school at Bart-lett High School in Anchorage and graduated from the University of Alas-ka in Anchorage with communication and a second degree, a bachelor’s of science in nutrition. After graduating, she worked for the University of Alaska Anchorage. Then we got her. She started as an intern. Her title now is a constituent relations representative, but truly she runs the place. She manages mail. She coordi-nates the interns. She does so much, and she always does it with the utmost professionalism. Kerry is headed off to better things. In a few weeks, she will be one of the few and the proud. She is headed off to Quantico, VA, to for the rigorous and very competitive marine officer can-didate school and then to the Basic School. Kerry says that pursuing a career as a commissioned officer in the U.S. Ma-rine Corps, the hardest branch of the military for women to make a career out of, especially as an officer, has been a long-held dream. The child of marine parents, she decided that she was going to go into the Marines when she was 6 years old. It was ‘‘Bring Your Mother to School’’ day, and Kerry’s mother showed up in uniform. She thought then, ‘‘I want to be like her.’’ There is no doubt in my mind that she will be. She plans on becoming a public af-fairs officer, where she will work to build understanding, credibility and trust. She will also work her hardest to protect the image of the Marine Corps both at home and abroad. It is young people like Kerry—people with drive, discipline and a servant’s heart—that made me so optimistic for our country’s future, and the future of my beloved Marine Corps. She is one of those people who every-one truly likes and who everyone who has ever worked with her trusts her to get the job done and to get it done right. Kerry, we will truly miss you. You will always have a place in our hearts and will always be part of the Sullivan team. Semper Fi. f 
ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
REMEMBERING RICHARD P. CONABOY ∑Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, today I wish to remember Judge Richard P. Conaboy, who served the people of Lackawanna County and the Middle District of Pennsylvania as a judge for over five decades. Judge Conaboy was born and raised in Scranton, PA. After graduating from the University of Scranton in 1945, he served in the Army Air Force and be-came a sergeant before his discharge in 1947. He earned a law degree from Catholic University in 1950 and prac-ticed law in Scranton for 12 years until he was appointed to be a judge on the Lackawanna County Court of Common Pleas in 1962. He served on this court with distinction for 17 years. Judge Conaboy was nominated to the Federal bench by President Jimmy Carter and confirmed by the Senate in 1979. He went on to serve the Middle District of Pennsylvania for nearly four decades. Judge Conaboy also served as chair-man of the U.S. Sentencing Commis-sion from 1994 to 1998. Notably, during his tenure, Judge Conaboy raised con-cerns about Congress’s decision to ad-dress the crack cocaine epidemic by significantly enhancing penalties for crack, but not powder, cocaine, cre-ating a sentencing disparity that he be-lieved was having a profound dispropor-tionate impact on minority commu-nities. His opposition to this disparity and his dedication to fairness in sen-tencing presaged Congress’s passage of the Fair Sentencing Act in 2010 and have continued to influence efforts to reform Federal sentencing laws. Judge Conaboy was known for his legal acumen, as well as his humility, patience, and fairness. Members of the

REMEMBERING WILLIAM J. NEALON ∑Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life and career of U.S. District Court Judge William J. Nealon. Appointed to the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania by President John F. Kennedy in 1962, Judge Nealon became the longest serv-ing Federal District Court judge in U.S. history on August 28, 2018. Born and raised in Scranton, PA, Judge Nealon attended Miami Univer-sity until he put his education on hold to join the Marine Corps during World War II. He served his country from 1942 to 1945, and when he returned, he earned his bachelor’s degree from Villanova University and his law de-gree from Catholic University. Judge Nealon distinguished himself early on in the practice of law. In 1960, less than a decade after joining the Pennsylvania bar, he was appointed to the Lackawanna County Court of Com-mon Pleas, the youngest such judge in the Commonwealth. Less than 3 years later, on December 13, 1962, President Kennedy appointed him to the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, and Judge Nealon be-came the youngest Federal District Court judge in the country. He went on to serve in this role for over 55 years. Judge Nealon was a brilliant jurist, committed to fairness and ‘‘equal jus-tice under law’’ in every case for every party who appeared in his courtroom. He will be remembered for his work ethic and commitment to his family. In addition to leaving behind a legacy of judicial and community service, Judge Nealon is survived by his wife of 70 years, Jean, 5 of their 10 children, 30 grandchildren, 26 great-grandchildren, and numerous nieces and nephews. The Federal courthouse in Scranton, which bears his name, will ensure that his decades of service to the Common-wealth of Pennsylvania and our coun-try will continue to inspire new gen-erations of public servants.∑

TRIBUTE TO LARRY SHELLITO ∑Ms. SMITH. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize and celebrate the ca-reer of retired lieutenant general and current Minnesota Department of Vet-erans Affairs commissioner Larry Shellito. Commissioner Shellito will be retiring from the Minnesota Depart-ment of Veterans Affairs on January 7, 2019, after leading the department for the past 7 years. His leadership has en-sured the Minnesota Department of Veterans Affairs will continue to pro-vide excellent care and services for years to come. Commissioner Shellito began his ca-reer in 1968 when he enlisted in the U.S. Army, during which time he served in Vietnam as a mobile advisory team leader. In 1973, he joined the Min-nesota National Guard where he served for the next 37 years. Starting as a rifle platoon leader, Commissioner Shellito went on to serve in nearly every com-mand position within the Minnesota National Guard, and in 2003, he was ap-pointed adjutant general by Governor Tim Pawlenty. In this final position, Commissioner Shellito diligently led the Minnesota National Guard in re-sponding to domestic incidents, trans-forming the force from a ready reserve to an operational force through mul-tiple deployments to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. He made sure the needs of his soldiers and their families were met when they returned home through the creation and implementa-tion of the Nation’s first Yellow Rib-bon Program. Commissioner Shellito’s leadership transformed the Minnesota National Guard into one of our Na-tion’s most respected and well-known organizations. While most people would retire after such an extensive career, Commis-sioner Shellito stepped up to the plate when Governor Mark Dayton asked him to serve as commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Veterans Af-fairs in 2011. At the Minnesota Depart-ment of Veterans Affairs, Commis-sioner Shellito has assisted Min-nesota’s 337,000 veterans and their de-pendents get the benefits and services they have earned. His stewardship has ensured veterans can find a place to call home, can find jobs in the public and private sectors, and have access to the services they need to help them heal from physical and psychological wounds. In the past year alone, Commissioner Shellito has led the department in ob-taining funding for three new veterans homes, improving residential satisfac-tion at Minneapolis veterans homes, opening a new state-of-the-art 100-bed skilled nursing care facility in Min-neapolis, and establishing the Nation’s first veterans home fixed dental care facility. The work Commissioner Shellito has done these past 7 years has set the Minnesota Department of Vet-erans Affairs up for success for years to come and is a testament to Commis-sioner Shellito’s character and com-mitment to service. On behalf of myself and all Minneso-tans, I want to congratulate Commis-sioner Shellito on an amazing career. Your more than 45 years of excellent public service, on Active and civilian duty, represents the finest Minnesota has to offer. We recognize your service, we are grateful for it, and we thank you.∑ TRIBUTE TO ANCHORAGE AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS ∑Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, it is coming up on the end of the week, time when I get to do one of the things I love to do best here on the Senate floor: recognizing an Alaskan or a group of Alaskans who help make my State so special. I call them our Alas-kan of the Week. Last time I spoke, I recognized all Alaskans who were impacted by the massive earthquake, a 7.0-magnitude earthquake centered about 7 miles north of Anchorage, that we experi-enced on Friday, November 30. The earthquake was the second larg-est that Alaska had experienced. The extent of the damage is still being evaluated, but the best guess is that it caused hundreds of millions of dollars of damage to homes, schools, roads—in-frastructure throughout the area. Aftershocks continue, at least 4,000 of them, and at least two dozen have been larger than 4.0. magnitude. Residents of Anchorage and the Mat- Su—Southcentral we call the area—are still rattled, but Alaskans are gen-erous, strong, and resilient, and they are skilled. They know what to do dur-ing an emergency. Today I want to recognize a group of Alaskans who, under immense pres-sure, did their jobs and served our State with cool heads, smart minds, and the upmost courage: the air traffic controllers who were on duty in both the Anchorage International Airport and at Merrill Field at the time the earthquake hit. Before I talk about the extraordinary actions they performed to keep air traffic running smoothly through the earthquake and the lengths they went through to make sure passengers were safe, let me spend a few minutes talk-ing about how important aviation is and air traffic controllers are to my State. So you know that my State is the biggest State in the country, more than twice the size of Texas. If you want to get a sense of how big it is, come up to my office where I have a map in the front room and cutouts of all the other States, to scale. Many of those States that make up our great country are basically dots on the map. We are big, but most of Alaska is only accessible by air. In fact, 82 per-cent of our communities—251—are not accessible by road. You have to fly to get there. The airspace serves as our highways. Alaska’s people travel by air eight times more often per capita than those in rural areas of the Lower 48 and ship 39 times more freight per capita, nearly one ton per person per year. Not only that, Anchorage is the crossroads to the Asia Pacific—we have one of the world’s best cargo hubs—and the air traffic controllers working the towers guide passengers and goods to the Far East, Iceland, and across the globe.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES7924 December 19, 2018 
All of that air traffic demands the best air traffic controllers, about 180 in the Anchorage area alone, working day and night to guide the planes in and guide them out. They are highly trained, skilled, and know what to do in case of an emergency. When the earth shook in Anchorage, it was an emergency, and our air traf-fic controllers both at Merrill Field, a general aviation airport, and at the busier Ted Stevens International Air-port, acted fast. Let me first talk about what hap-pened at the Ted Stevens International Airport during the earthquake. According to a reporter, when the earthquake hit, one of the managers said the tower that they were in swayed 3 or 4 feet and described watch-ing transformers blow out around town from the tower. A FedEx plane was coming in, and they got on their radios. ‘‘FedEx, go around, FedEx, go around!’’ they told the plane, averting a potential acci-dent. Once they realized how severe the earthquake was, the controllers evacu-ated, carrying their radios. So they chose another option: The three guided the airplanes in from the cab of a pickup truck. They had what they needed—radios, phones, and a window—and they had the support of dozens of FAA employ-ees at other locations. This is what is amazing; Because of their quick thinking, the airport’s three runways were closed for less than 10 minutes after a 7-magnitude earth-quake struck. On the other side of town, at Merrill Field control tower, a similar story was unfolding. Again, the controllers and all on the team evacuated, and again, the con-trollers took their private vehicles out to the ramp and powered up FAA port-able radios. The initial lull in general aviation and flight school traffic was quickly replaced by public safety helicopter and Medevac flights, Civil Air Patrol aircraft on disaster relief and recon-naissance missions, and airborne ob-servers checking critical pipeline and roadway infrastructure. I am so proud of how everyone in Southcentral reacted to the earth-quake. Kids immediately dove under desks. Our first responders jumped into action. Neighbors helped neighbors. And they are still doing so. Not one person died as a result of the earthquake. I am so proud of our air traffic con-trollers who, under immense pressure, improvised and did what needed to be done to keep everyone safe and make sure that flights weren’t disrupted. Thank you for all you did during that very frightening time, and thank you for all you do for all of us every day. Congratulations for being our Alaskans of the Week.∑ MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to the Senate by Ms. Ridgway, one of his secretaries.

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS By Mr. CARPER (for himself and Ms. M
URKOWSKI ): S. 3779. A bill to establish a vol-untary program that strengthens the economy, public health, and environ-ment of the United States by reducing emissions from wood heaters, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works. Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise to talk about the Wood Heater Emissions Reduction Act, or WHERA, which I am introducing today with my good friend (Ms. M
URKOWSKI ), the senior Senator from Alaska. In 2005, my dear friend, former Sen-ator Voinovich, came to me with a great idea—the Diesel Emissions Re-duction Act, or DERA. DERA didn’t roll back emissions standards for diesel engines, but instead created an Envi-ronmental Protection Agency (EPA) grant program to incentivize the use of newer diesel technology. Together, and joined by many of my colleagues that are still serving in the Senate today, we established one of the most success-ful clean air programs on the books. This program is one that is loved by re-tailers, manufactures, States and health groups alike. As many of my colleagues know, I’m someone that is always trying to find out what works and do more of it. When my staff explained to me the public health challenges that residen-tial wood heaters present to commu-nities, especially rural communities across this country; I knew the chal-lenges were very similar to the ones we faced with diesel engines in 2005. I knew if DERA could be a successful program to retrofit or replace old die-sel engines, we could use the program as a framework to replace residential wood heaters. Like the eleven million old diesel en-gines that were on the road a decade ago, there are over eleven million homes that use wood as a primary or secondary heat source, and a majority of those homes are located in rural

areas. These residential wood heaters, such as woodstoves, pellet stoves and wood furnaces, often have a long life- span, some lasting more than fifty years. Due to this long lifespan, indus-try estimates that six million residen-tial wood heaters in operation today do not meet 1988 EPA Clean Air Act emis-sion standards, much less the current emissions standards implemented in 2015. Collectively, older residential wood heaters are a major source of air pollu-tion in the United States, especially in rural areas. According to EPA, older, inefficient residential wood heaters can produce a deadly mix of particulate matter (or PM), carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds (which contribute to ozone), black carbon (which contributes to climate change) and air toxics (such as benzene and formaldehyde). This pollution builds up inside and outside the home and con-taminates the air we breathe. This pol-lution can trigger asthma attacks and cause lung damage, cancer, and other significant health problems, including death. As other industries clean up their air emissions, older, inefficient residential wood heaters stand out among the largest sources of PM pollution. EPA data indicate that nation-wide, ineffi-cient residential wood heaters emit five times more PM pollution than the U.S. petroleum refineries, cement man-ufacturers, and pulp and paper plants combined. In Delaware alone, older wood heaters are the second largest source of PM pollution in the state, contributing more than highway vehi-cles, electric utilities and the petro-leum industries combined. In Alaska, inefficient woodstoves and wood heat-ers play a significant role in the classi-fication of Fairbanks as a nonattain-ment area for fine particulate air pol-lution. Fortunately, technology made and sold in the U.S. can dramatically re-duce the pollution that is emitted from residential wood heaters and the amount of wood needed to heat a home. Wood heaters being made today that meet EPA’s strictest emission stand-ards emit at least 70% less PM and save consumers twenty to forty percent in heating costs from gained efficiencies. If we could encourage all homeowners to use the latest residential wood heat-er technology, it could have a massive beneficial effect on public health. EPA has determined that replacing just one old, inefficient wood heater is equiva-lent to taking five dirty diesel engines off the road and the monetized public health benefits from replacing the Na-tion’s old, inefficient residential wood heaters would be up to $126 billion per year. Baser on all that we know, it is clear that replacing older stoves for newer, cleaner burning stoves will re-sult in cleaner air, lower healthcare bills and lower costs for consumers. Unfortunately, as with old diesel en-gine owners, most homeowners are not aware of the health problems associ-ated with their old wood heaters or cannot afford to buy a new wood heater on their own. This means that newer, cleaner heaters are not getting into homes fast enough. The Carper-Mur-kowski Wood Heater Emissions Reduc-tion Act attempts to solve this prob-lem. WHERA authorizes a five-year grant program at EPA to incentivize the re-moval and replacement of old, ineffi-cient residential wood heaters for more efficient, clean-burning heaters. Spe-cifically, WHERA funding targets in-centives to: (1) scrap or recycle old wood heaters; and (2) replace them with new, efficient, clean burning and properly installed heaters that at least meet EPA’s most stringent wood heat-er emission standards. Using the suc-cessful Diesel Emissions Reduction Act as a model, WHERA allows States, In-dian tribes, territories, and local air quality agencies to compete for Fed-eral dollars to fund wood heater change-out programs that work for their communities. WHERA also supports retailers and manufacturers with the transition to cleaner, more efficient residential wood heaters. WHERA incentivizes homeowners to buy the best available residential wood heater products— when they might not otherwise do so— giving financial incentives for retailers and manufacturers to sell and make the best products. Overall, the residen-tial wood heater industry has been sup-portive of such wood heater change-out programs at the State and local level. Because rural areas and tribal areas have a disproportionate need, WHERA also requires that Indian tribal and rural communities are fairly rep-resented in funding allocations and that Indian tribal governments receive at least 4% of total funding under the program. My friend from Alaska and I feel that we’ve put together a program that will be as, or more, successful than the DERA program. Replacing outdated wood heaters with new clean-burning heaters that meet EPA emission stand-ards will reduce toxic air pollution and particulate matter, protect public health, and support American jobs. This legislation is a true win-win-win, and one that I commend to my col-leagues for their serious consideration. 
By Mr. DURBIN: S. 3784. A bill to address the needs of workers in industries likely to be im-pacted by rapidly evolving tech-nologies; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the R
ECORD . There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the R
ECORD , as follows: 
S. 3784 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-resentatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Investing in Tomorrow’s Workforce Act of 2018’’. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress makes the following findings: (1) In 2014, the United States spent just 0.1 percent of the Nation’s Gross Domestic Prod-uct on labor market policies, less than half of what the United States spent on labor market policies 30 years ago. (2) The number of workers receiving feder-ally supported training has declined in the past 3 decades as advances in technology have simultaneously shifted labor market demand over time. (3) As much as 47 percent of all jobs in the United States are at risk of being replaced by automation technology, and job losses from automation are more likely to impact workers making less than $40,000 annually. (4) Strong Federal investment in expanding training services for workers whose jobs may be lost due to automation could prepare the United States workforce to better adapt to changes in the labor market and enter into skilled positions in technologically-oriented occupations and industries. (5) A focus on preparing the workforce of the United States for jobs that utilize ad-vanced technologies could grow wages, in-crease economic productivity, and boost the competitiveness of the United States.

By Mr. HATCH (for himself and Mr. S
CHUMER ): S. 3793. A bill to acknowledge the rights of States with respect to sports wagering and to maintain a distinct Federal interest in the integrity and character of professional and amateur sporting contests, and for other pur-poses; to the Committee on the Judici-ary. Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, on May 14, 2018, the Supreme Court in Murphy v. NCAA, 138 S. Ct. 1461, 2018, struck down the Federal prohibition of State- authorized sports wagering schemes. I was one of four original authors of that prohibition, the Professional and Ama-teur Sports Protection Act of 1992, Public Law 102–559; 106 Stat. 4227, which found that ‘‘sports gambling conducted pursuant to State law threatens the integrity and character of, and public confidence in, profes-sional and amateur sports, instills in-appropriate values in the Nation’s youth, misappropriates the goodwill and popularity of professional and amateur sports organizations, and di-lutes and tarnishes the service marks of such organizations.’’ Today, I joined with Senator C
HUCK  S
CHUMER to introduce the Sports Wa-gering Market Integrity Act of 2018, a comprehensive legislative response to the Murphy decision. This legislation is the product of nearly one year of dis-cussions with stakeholders on all sides of the issue, the gaming industry, pro-fessional and amateur sports leagues, consumer advocates, data providers, law enforcement, and many others. I would urge my soon-to-be former colleagues and other Members of Con-gress, should they choose to take up this issue, to use the bill I have intro-duced today as a starting point for their work, but recognize that there is much work to be done, and I would an-ticipate that any final legislation might look very different from the bill that was introduced today. For exam-ple, the degree to which the Depart-ment of Justice or other Federal agen-cies need to be involved in overseeing state sports wagering regimes, the ap-propriate level of control that sports organizations should have over sports wagering, and the basis for requiring the use of so-called official league data continue to be open questions in my mind. I do not necessarily believe that those and other provisions introduced in the bill today reflect a final decision regarding the appropriate policy. But these provisions do flag many of the difficult issues to be considered as part of the sports wagering discussion. I would urge my colleagues not to be dis-couraged by the challenges and com-peting interests, and I look forward to being supportive of future congres-sional efforts to engage on this issue. f 
SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS 
SENATE RESOLUTION 733—CALL-ING ON THE GOVERNMENT OF CAMEROON, ARMED SEPARATIST GROUPS, AND ALL CITIZENS TO RESPECT HUMAN RIGHTS AND ADOPT NONVIOLENT AP-PROACHES TO CONFLICT RESO-LUTION Mr. CARDIN (for himself, Mr. Y
OUNG , Mr. V
ANHOLLEN , Mr. C OONS , Mr. M AR-
KEY, Mr. B OOKER , and Ms. K LOBUCHAR ) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations: 
S. R ES. 733 Whereas the Government of Cameroon has repeatedly restricted freedoms of expression nationwide by shutting down the internet, harassing and detaining journalists, refusing licenses to independent media, and inten-sifying political attacks against the inde-pendent press; Whereas, following Cameroon’s October 7, 2018, elections, the African Union Election Observation Mission stated that ‘‘the cur-rent framework needs to be strengthened in order to safeguard the democratic principles of separation of powers, fairness, and inde-pendence and impartiality,’’ which the De-partment of State echoed, emphasizing the need to ‘‘respect the rule of law, resolve peacefully any disputes through established legal channels, and avoid hate speech’’. Whereas Anglophone Cameroonians have long felt marginalized by official actions and policies of the Government of Cameroon; Whereas, beginning in late 2016, protests organized by lawyers, teachers, and students were violently repressed by the Government of Cameroon, leading to numerous deaths and imprisonments, including journalists and lawyers; Whereas, in January 2017, the Government of Cameroon ordered the suspension of Inter-net services in the Northwest and Southwest regions of Cameroon, the suspension lasting for 93 days and having a major, debilitating effect on the economy, educational institu-tions, freedom of expression, and social com-munication of the region’s residents; Whereas the conflict escalated in late Sep-tember and early October 2017, when Cameroonian security forces brutally cracked down on unarmed civilians peace-fully demonstrating, resulting in at least 20 people dying and leaving over 100 injured; Whereas, in 2017, armed separatist groups launched a campaign to pressure school offi-cials in the Anglophone region to go on strike as part of a boycott against the Gov-ernment of Cameroon, and began burning school buildings and threatening education officials with violence if they did not comply with a boycott of schools in the Anglophone regions; Whereas human rights monitors have docu-mented armed groups killing traditional leaders and targeting civilians who are per-ceived to be supporting or working with the Government of Cameroon, and reports indi-cate that armed militants have killed Cameroonian security force personnel; Whereas numerous credible reports from human rights monitors, including the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, have documented the excessive use of force by Government of Cameroon security forces against Cameroonians living in the Anglophone regions, including the burning of villages, the use of live ammunition against protestors, arbitrary arrest and detention, torture, and sexual abuse; Whereas the Department of State has ex-pressed serious concern over the Government of Cameroon’s use of force to restrict free ex-pression, and the use of violence against in-dividuals protesting the Government’s poli-cies in the Anglophone regions; Whereas both the Government of Cam-eroon security forces and armed groups have been documented targeting and brutally kill-ing civilians in the Anglophone regions, in-cluding women and children; Whereas United States citizen Charles Wesco was senselessly killed near the town of Bamenda, Cameroon on October 30, 2018, after being caught in what the Department of State has characterized as ‘‘cross fire’’; Whereas the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs stated in November 2018 that at least 437,000 people were internally displaced in areas affected by the Anglophone conflict; Whereas the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees reported that it had registered more than 29,000 Cameroonian refugees from the Anglophone regions in Nigeria as of late October 2018; Whereas 47 Anglophone activists were forc-ibly returned from Nigerian custody to Cameroonian authorities, despite many hav-ing reportedly submitted asylum claims in Nigeria; and Whereas 10 of the 47 individuals forcibly re-turned from Nigeria now face charges pun-ishable by the death penalty, while the other 37 reportedly remain in detention without charge: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Senate— (1) urges all parties to the conflict in Cam-eroon, including political opposition groups, to– (A) agree to an immediate ceasefire; (B) allow for unfettered humanitarian as-sistance; (C) exercise restraint and ensure that pro-tests remain peaceful; and (D) engage in inclusive dialogue with civil society to get to a political solution that re-spects the rights and freedoms of the people of Cameroon; (2) strongly condemns the abuses com-mitted by the Government of Cameroon, se-curity forces, and armed separatist groups in the Anglophone regions, including extrajudicial killings and detentions, the use of force against nonviolent civilians and protestors, and violations of the freedoms of press, expression, and assembly;

(4) urges the Government of Cameroon to— (A) initiate a credible, inclusive, good, and full faith effort to work with religious and community leaders in the Anglophone region to engage in meaningful dialogue and ad-dress grievances and seek nonviolent solu-tions to resolve the conflict, including pos-sibly involving an independent mediator in such negotiations; (B) respect the fundamental rights of all Cameroonian citizens, including political ac-tivists and journalists; (C) ensure that any security operations are conducted in accordance with international human rights standards, including efforts to ensure security forces only use force under appropriate circumstances;

S. R ES. 734 Whereas Texas, Wisconsin, Alabama, Ar-kansas, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Paul LePage (Governor of Maine), Mississippi (by and through Gov-ernor Phil Bryant), Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Carolina, South Da-kota, Tennessee, Utah, and West Virginia have filed suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, ar-guing that the Patient Protection and Af-fordable Care Act (Public Law 111–148; 124 Stat. 119), is unconstitutional and should be enjoined, by asserting that the Act’s require-ment to maintain minimum essential cov-erage (commonly known as the ‘‘individual responsibility provision’’) in section 5000A(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, is un-constitutional following the amendment of that provision by the Act to provide for rec-onciliation pursuant to titles II and V of the concurrent resolution on the budget for fis-cal year 2018 (Public Law 115–97) (commonly known as the ‘‘Tax Cuts and Jobs Act’’); Whereas these State and individual plain-tiffs also seek to strike down the entire Pa-tient Protection and Affordable Care Act as not severable from the individual responsi-bility provision; Whereas, on June 7, 2018, the Department of Justice refused to defend the constitu-tionality of the amended individual responsi-bility provision, despite the well-established duty of the Department to defend Federal statutes where reasonable arguments can be made in their defense; Whereas the Department of Justice not only refused to defend the amended indi-vidual responsibility provision, but it affirm-atively argued that this provision is uncon-stitutional and that the provisions of the Pa-tient Protection and Affordable Care Act guaranteeing issuance of insurance coverage regardless of health status or pre-existing conditions (commonly known as the ‘‘guar-anteed issue provision’’), sections 2702, 2704, and 2705(a) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300gg–1, 300gg–3, 300gg–4(a)), and prohibiting discriminatory premium rates (commonly known as the ‘‘community rating provision’’), sections 2701 and 2705(b) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300gg(a)(1), 300gg–4(b)) must now be struck down as not severable from the individual re-sponsibility provision; and Whereas the district court in Texas v. United States, No. 4:18–cv–00167–O (N.D. Tex.) issued an order on December 14, 2018 declar-ing that the individual responsibility provi-sion in section 5000A(a) of the Internal Rev-enue Code of 1986 is unconstitutional and that all the provisions of the Patient Protec-tion and Affordable Care Act are not sever-able and therefore are invalid: Now, there-fore, be it Resolved, That the Senate Legal Counsel is authorized to represent the Senate in Texas v. United States, No. 4:18–cv–00167–O (N.D. Tex.), including seeking to— (1) intervene as a party in the matter and related proceedings; and (2) defend all provisions of the Patient Pro-tection and Affordable Care Act, the amend-ments made by that Act to other provisions of law, and any amendments to such provi-sions, including the provisions ensuring af-fordable health coverage for those with pre- existing conditions. f SENATE RESOLUTION 735—CON-DEMNING THE MASS ATROCITIES COMMITTED AGAINST THE ROHINGYA IN BURMA AND URG-ING ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE BURMESE MILITARY Mr. MARKEY (for himself, Mr. R
UBIO, Mr. C ARDIN , Ms. C OLLINS , and Mr. M
ERKLEY ) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.: 
S. R ES. 735 Whereas, in recent decades, the Rohingya people have lost, through systematic dis-crimination by Burmese national, state, and local authorities, a range of civil and polit-ical rights, including citizenship, and face barriers today such that they have been ren-dered stateless; Whereas, beginning on August 25, 2017, the Government of Burma military and security forces, as well as civilian mobs, carried out widespread attacks, rapes, killings, and the burning of villages throughout Rakhine State, resulting in approximately 730,000 Rohingya fleeing to Bangladesh and bringing the total Rohingya refugee population in Cox’s Bazar to over 900,000; Whereas international observers widely agree that Burma has not made progress on the ‘‘more crucial’’ of the 88 recommenda-tions of the Rakhine Advisory Commission that addresses the root causes of conflict and ensures the rights and dignity of the Rohingya: freedom of movement, civil docu-mentation, and a transparent pathway to citizenship; Whereas, since the beginning of the vio-lence in August 2017, humanitarian and media access to Rakhine State has been ex-tremely limited; Whereas Reuters journalists Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were arrested on December 12, 2017, for their work to report on the Burmese military’s violent campaign against the Rohingya; Whereas, on November 14, 2018, Vice Presi-dent Mike Pence said, ‘‘This is a tragedy that has touched the hearts of millions of Americans. The violence and persecution by military and vigilantes that resulted in driv-ing 700,000 Rohingya to Bangladesh is with-out excuse.’’; Whereas, to date, though the refugee crisis is not of their making, the Government of Bangladesh has accommodated the rapid and massive influx of Rohingya refugees into Cox’s Bazar; Whereas Burma’s civilian government, led by State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi and President Win Myint, has yet to take the necessary steps to address the violence di-rected against the Rohingya, has failed to create the necessary conditions for returns (including by actively impeding access to northern Rakhine by UNHCR, UNDP, hu-manitarian organizations, and journalists), and has failed to fully implement rec-ommendations from the Rakhine Advisory Commission that address the root causes of conflict in Rakhine; Whereas, on August 27, 2018, the United Na-tions International Fact Finding Mission on Myanmar released a report stating that, ‘‘The Mission concluded . . . that there is suf-ficient information to warrant the investiga-tion and prosecution of senior officials in the Tatmadaw chain of command, so that a com-petent court can determine their liability for genocide in relation to the situation in Rakhine State.’’; Whereas, on August 25, 2018, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo stated that ‘‘[a] year ago, following deadly militant attacks, secu-rity forces responded by launching abhorrent ethnic cleansing of ethnic Rohingya in Burma,’’ and continued, ‘‘The U.S. will con-tinue to hold those responsible accountable. The military must respect human rights for Burma’s democracy to succeed.’’; Whereas, on August 17, 2018, the Depart-ment of the Treasury announced sanctions on five Tatmadaw officers and two Tatmadaw units for human rights abuses in Rakhine, Kachin, and Shan states; Whereas, on September 24, 2018, the De-partment of State released a report entitled ‘‘Documentation of Atrocities in Northern Rakhine State’’ that stated the military ‘‘targeted civilians indiscriminately and often with extreme brutality’’ and that the violence in northern Rakhine State was ‘‘ex-treme, large-scale, widespread and seemingly geared toward both terrorizing the popu-lation and driving out the Rohingya resi-dents’’ and that the ‘‘scope and scale of the

military’s operations indicate that they were well-planned and coordinated’’; Whereas, on November 29, 2018, the Public International Law and Policy Group, which was contracted by the Department of State to collect evidence for the Department’s re-port, issued its own report that concluded ‘‘there is a reasonable basis to conclude that war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide were committed against the Rohingya population’’; Whereas the United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, signed at Paris December 9, 1948, declares that genocide ‘‘means any of the following acts committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such: (a) Killing members of the group; (b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; (c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; (d) Imposing measures intended to pre-vent births within the group; (e) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group’’ and that ‘‘[t]he following acts shall be punishable: (a) Genocide; (b) Conspiracy to commit genocide; (c) Direct and public in-citement to commit genocide; (d) Attempt to commit genocide; (e) Complicity in geno-cide’’; and Whereas the United States Holocaust Me-morial announced on December 3, 2018, that ‘‘there is compelling evidence that Burmese authorities have intentionally sought to de-stroy the Rohingya people because of their ethnic and religious identity,’’and concluded there was compelling evidence genocide was committed: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Senate— (1) condemns the atrocities and displace-ment inflicted on Burma’s Rohingya popu-lation by the Burmese military and security forces since August 2017; (2) calls on the Secretary of State, based on credible evidence, to make a formal deter-mination on whether the crimes committed since August 2017, amount to genocide; (3) commends the role of the Government of Bangladesh in receiving Rohingya refu-gees to date and urges the Government of Bangladesh to continue allowing the full par-ticipation of UNHCR and human rights orga-nization in accessing refugee camps; (4) calls upon Facebook and other social media platforms to take the appropriate steps to guard against the dissemination of hate speech exploiting ethnic divisions in Burma; (5) calls on the Government of Burma to immediately release Reuters journalists Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo; (6) urges the President to impose addi-tional sanctions on senior members of Bur-ma’s military and security forces, including Burmese military owned companies and enti-ties, who are responsible for genocide and human rights abuses against the Rohingya; and (7) calls upon the President to maintain the status of the United States as a top international donor to the humanitarian re-sponse in Burma and Bangladesh and to sub-mit a budget request for fiscal year 2020 that reflects that longstanding United States commitment. f 
SENATE RESOLUTION 736—URGING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A CYBER LEAGUE OF INDO-PACIFIC STATES TO ADDRESS CYBER THREATS Mr. GARDNER (for himself and Mr. C
OONS ) submitted the following resolu-tion; which was referred to the Com-mittee on Foreign Relations.: S. R ES. 736 Whereas the world has benefitted greatly from technological innovations under the leadership of the United States in the post- World War era, including the creation of the World Wide Web which has provided an en-tirely new platform for wealth creation and human flourishing through cyber-commerce and connectivity; Whereas cybercrime affects companies large and small, as well as infrastructure that is vital to the economy as a whole; Whereas a 2018 study from the Center for Strategic and International Studies, in part-nership with McAfee, estimates that the global economic losses from cybercrime are approximately $600,000,000,000 annually and rising; Whereas, according to the Pew Charitable Trust, 64 percent of people in the United States had fallen victim to cybercriminals as of 2017; Whereas, on July 9, 2012, General Keith Alexander, then-Director of the National Se-curity Agency, termed theft of United States intellectual property ‘‘the greatest transfer of wealth in history’’; Whereas, on September 25, 2015, the United States and the People’s Republic of China announced a commitment that ‘‘neither country’s government will conduct or know-ingly support cyber-enabled theft of intellec-tual property, including trade secrets or other confidential business information, with the intent of providing competitive ad-vantages to companies or commercial sec-tors’’; Whereas the People’s Republic of China nonetheless continues to contribute to the rise of cybercrime, exploiting weaknesses in the international system to undermine fair competition in technology and cyberspace, including through theft of intellectual prop-erty and state-sponsored malicious actions to undermine and weaken competition; Whereas, according to the 2018 Worldwide Threat Assessment by the Director of the National Intelligence: ‘‘China will continue to use cyber espionage and bolster cyber at-tack capabilities to support national secu-rity priorities. . . . China since 2015 has been advancing its cyber attack capabilities by integrating its military cyber attack and es-pionage resources in the Strategic Support Force, which it established in 2015’’; Whereas, from 2011 to 2018, more than 90 percent of cases handled by the Department of Justice alleging economic espionage by or to benefit a foreign country involved the People’s Republic of China; Whereas more than 
2⁄3of the cases handled by the Department of Justice involving theft of trade secrets have a nexus to the People’s Republic of China; Whereas experts have asserted that the Made in China 2025 strategy of the Govern-ment of the People’s Republic of China will incentivize Chinese entities to engage in un-fair competitive behavior, including addi-tional theft of technologies and intellectual property; Whereas the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea has also contributed to the rise of cybercrime and according to the 2018 World-wide Threat Assessment by the Director of the National Intelligence: ‘‘We expect the heavily sanctioned North Korea to use cyber operations to raise funds and to gather intel-ligence or launch attacks on South Korea and the United States. . . . North Korean ac-tors developed and launched the WannaCry ransomware in May 2017, judging from tech-nical links to previously identified North Ko-rean cyber tools, tradecraft, and operational infrastructure. We also assess that these ac-tors conducted the cyber theft of $81 million from the Bank of Bangladesh in 2016’’; Whereas section 2(a)(8) of the North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act of 2016 (22 U.S.C. 9201(a)(8)) states, ‘‘The Gov-ernment of North Korea has provided tech-nical support and conducted destructive and coercive cyberattacks, including against Sony Pictures Entertainment and other United States persons.’’; Whereas the United States has taken ac-tion on its own against international cybercrime, including through— (1) the North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act of 2016 (Public Law 114– 122), which imposed mandatory sanctions against persons engaging in significant ac-tivities undermining cybersecurity on behalf of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea; and (2) criminal charges filed by the Depart-ment of Justice on October 25, 2018, in which the Department alleged that the Chinese in-telligence services conducted cyber intru-sions against at least a dozen companies in order to obtain information on a commercial jet engine; Whereas the March 2016 Department of State International Cyberspace Policy Strat-egy noted that ‘‘the Department of State an-ticipates a continued increase and expansion of our cyber-focused diplomatic efforts for the foreseeable future’’; and Whereas concerted action by countries that share concerns about state-sponsored cyber theft is necessary to prevent the growth of cybercrime and other destabilizing national security and economic outcomes: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Senate— (1) urges the President to propose and champion the negotiation of a treaty with like-minded partners in the Indo-Pacific to ensure a free and open Internet free from economically crippling cyberattacks; (2) calls for the treaty, which can be re-ferred to as the Cyber League of Indo-Pacific States (in this resolution referred to as ‘‘CLIPS’’), to include the creation of an In-formation Sharing Analysis Center to pro-vide around-the-clock cyber threat moni-toring and mitigation for governments that are parties to the treaty; and (3) calls for members of CLIPS— (A) to consult on emerging cyber threats; (B) to pledge not to engage in cyber theft; (C) to introduce and enforce minimum criminal punishment for cyber theft; (D) to extradite alleged cyber thieves; (E) to enforce laws protecting software li-cense holders; (F) to ensure that government agencies use licensed software; (G) to minimize data localization require-ments (consistent with the Agreement be-tween the United States of America, the United Mexican States, and Canada, signed at Buenos Aires November 30, 2018 (com-monly known as the ‘‘United States-Mexico- Canada Agreement’’)); (H) to accept international certifications as the basis for commercial information and communications technology reviews; (I) to provide for public input when devis-ing legislation on cybersecurity; and (J) to cooperate on the attribution of cyberattacks and retribution to deter future attacks.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S7933 December 19, 2018 
SENATE RESOLUTION 737—RECOG-NIZING THE 75TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE UNITED STATES CADET NURSE CORPS AND EXPRESSING THE APPRECIATION OF THE SENATE FOR THE CONTRIBUTION OF THE MEMBERS OF THE UNITED STATES CADET NURSE CORPS DURING WORLD WAR II Mr. KING (for himself, Ms. C
OLLINS , and Ms. W
ARREN ) submitted the fol-lowing resolution; which was consid-ered and agreed to: 
S. R ES. 737 Whereas the personnel requirements of World War II created a shortage of nurses and, by 1942, it was evident that the pace of training for new nurses could not keep up with the demands of the military and civil-ian populations of the United States; Whereas, as nurses vacated positions in hospitals, schools, and welfare agencies to meet the needs of the Armed Forces, an in-flux of millions of new workers to industrial areas created unprecedented public health challenges, and such challenges were exacer-bated by a nursing capacity that was not suf-ficient to meet the demands of both the Armed Forces and essential civilian services; Whereas the Act of June 15, 1943 (57 Stat. 153, chapter 126; commonly known as the ‘‘Bolton Act’’), unanimously passed both houses of Congress; Whereas the Bolton Act resulted in the es-tablishment of the United States Cadet Nurse Corps, which was a uniformed service under the direction of the United States Public Health Service and operated from 1943 to 1948; Whereas the United States Cadet Nurse Corps was open to minorities, including Afri-can Americans and Native Americans, be-cause the Bolton Act included a provision re-stricting discrimination in the administra-tion of the Act on account of race, creed, or color; Whereas enrollment in the United States Cadet Nurse Corps required a commitment to serve for the duration of World War II, with each cadet taking the following pledge: ‘‘I will dedicate myself now and forever to the triumph of life over death; As a Cadet nurse, I pledge to my country my service in essen-tial nursing for the duration of the war.’’; Whereas an April 1944 memorandum from the Federal Security Agency identified ‘‘na-tional recognition for rendering a vital war service’’ as a privilege of service in the United States Cadet Nurse Corps; Whereas with more than 120,000 women en-rolled in the United States Cadet Nurse Corps by the termination of the program, the United States Cadet Nurse Corps played an important role in overcoming the nursing shortage at military, Federal, and non-Fed-eral hospitals across the United States; and Whereas Surgeon General Thomas Parran, appearing before the Committee on Military Affairs of the House of Representatives in January 1945, highlighted the positive con-tribution of the United States Cadet Nurse Corps to the war effort by stating, ‘‘We can-not measure what the loss to the country would have been if [the] civilian nursing service had collapsed, any more than we could measure the cost of failure on the Nor-mandy beachheads.’’: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Senate— (1) recognizes the 75th anniversary of the formation of the United States Cadet Nurse Corps; and (2) expresses appreciation for the vital con-tribution that the members of the United States Cadet Nurse Corps made to the war effort by filling critical military and essen-tial civilian nursing positions during the nursing shortage caused by World War II. f SENATE RESOLUTION 738—EX-PRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT THE UNITED STATES SHOULD CONTINUE ITS LIMITED MILITARY ACTIVITIES WITHIN SYRIA AND THAT END-ING SUCH ACTIVITIES AT THIS TIME WOULD EMBOLDEN ISIS, BASHAR AL-ASSAD, IRAN, AND RUSSIA AND PUT OUR KURDISH ALLIES IN GREAT JEOPARDY Mr. GRAHAM (for himself, Mrs. S
HA-
HEEN , Mr. C OTTON , Mrs. E RNST , Mr. R
UBIO, Mr. K ING, Mr. C ORKER , and Mr. R
EED) submitted the following resolu-tion; which was referred to the Com-mittee on Foreign Relations: 
S. R ES. 738 Whereas ISIS has been dealt a serious blow in Iraq and Syria and is substantially dam-aged but not yet defeated; Whereas the United States has a limited military presence in Syria with approxi-mately 2,000 troops who serve as an insur-ance policy against future threats; Whereas a precipitous withdrawal of United States Armed Forces from Syria will embolden radical jihadist groups in Syria and in the region; Whereas it is in the vital national interest of the United States to continue to support partners, such as the Kurds, in Syria and other locations in the Global War on Terror; Whereas a United States withdrawal will embolden the brutal dictatorship of Bashar al-Assad and bring more suffering to the peo-ple of Syria and the region; Whereas a precipitous withdrawal of United States Armed Forces from Syria could lead to the release of hundreds of for-eign terrorists currently detained by the Syrian Democratic Forces; and Whereas it is in the national security in-terest of the United States to counter Iran’s and Russia’s influence in Syria and through-out the region: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Senate— (1) calls on the President to reconsider his decision to withdraw United States Armed Forces from Syria at this time; and (2) urges any future decision to withdraw United States Armed Forces from Syria to be the result of a robust interagency process and to be conditions-based. f

SA 4168. Ms. HARRIS (for Mr. B OOK-
ER) proposed an amendment to the bill S. 3178, to amend title 18, United States Code, to specify lynching as a depriva-tion of civil rights, and for other pur-poses; as follows: 
Strike all after the enacting clause and in-sert the following: 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Justice for Victims of Lynching Act of 2018’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: (1) The crime of lynching succeeded slav-ery as the ultimate expression of racism in the United States following Reconstruction. (2) Lynching was a widely acknowledged practice in the United States until the mid-dle of the 20th century. (3) Lynching was a crime that occurred throughout the United States, with docu-mented incidents in all but 4 States. (4) At least 4,742 people, predominantly Af-rican Americans, were reported lynched in the United States between 1882 and 1968. (5) Ninety-nine percent of all perpetrators of lynching escaped from punishment by State or local officials. (6) Lynching prompted African Americans to form the National Association for the Ad-vancement of Colored People (referred to in this section as the ‘‘NAACP’’) and prompted members of B’nai B’rith to found the Anti- Defamation League. (7) Mr. Walter White, as a member of the NAACP and later as the executive secretary of the NAACP from 1931 to 1955, meticulously investigated lynchings in the United States and worked tirelessly to end segregation and racialized terror. (8) Nearly 200 anti-lynching bills were in-troduced in Congress during the first half of the 20th century. (9) Between 1890 and 1952, 7 Presidents peti-tioned Congress to end lynching. (10) Between 1920 and 1940, the House of Representatives passed 3 strong anti-lynch-ing measures. (11) Protection against lynching was the minimum and most basic of Federal respon-sibilities, and the Senate considered but failed to enact anti-lynching legislation de-spite repeated requests by civil rights groups, Presidents, and the House of Rep-resentatives to do so. (12) The publication of ‘‘Without Sanc-tuary: Lynching Photography in America’’ helped bring greater awareness and proper recognition of the victims of lynching. (13) Only by coming to terms with history can the United States effectively champion human rights abroad. (14) An apology offered in the spirit of true repentance moves the United States toward reconciliation and may become central to a new understanding, on which improved ra-cial relations can be forged. (15) Having concluded that a reckoning with our own history is the only way the country can effectively champion human rights abroad, 90 Members of the United States Senate agreed to Senate Resolution 39, 109th Congress, on June 13, 2005, to apolo-gize to the victims of lynching and the de-scendants of those victims for the failure of the Senate to enact anti-lynching legisla-tion. (16) The National Memorial for Peace and Justice, which opened to the public in Mont-gomery, Alabama, on April 26, 2018, is the Nation’s first memorial dedicated to the leg-acy of enslaved Black people, people terror-ized by lynching, African Americans humili-ated by racial segregation and Jim Crow, and people of color burdened with contemporary presumptions of guilt and police violence. (17) Notwithstanding the Senate’s apology and the heightened awareness and education about the Nation’s legacy with lynching, it is wholly necessary and appropriate for the Congress to enact legislation, after 100 years of unsuccessful legislative efforts, finally to make lynching a Federal crime. (18) Further, it is the sense of Congress that criminal action by a group increases the likelihood that the criminal object of that group will be successfully attained and de-creases the probability that the individuals involved will depart from their path of crim-inality. Therefore, it is appropriate to speci-fy criminal penalties for the crime of lynch-ing, or any attempt or conspiracy to commit lynching. (19) The United States Senate agreed to unanimously Senate Resolution 118, 115th Congress, on April 5, 2017, ‘‘[c]ondemning hate crime and any other form of racism, re-ligious or ethnic bias, discrimination, incite-ment to violence, or animus targeting a mi-nority in the United States’’ and taking no-tice specifically of Federal Bureau of Inves-tigation statistics demonstrating that ‘‘among single-bias hate crime incidents in the United States, 59.2 percent of victims were targeted due to racial, ethnic, or ances-tral bias, and among those victims, 52.2 per-cent were victims of crimes motivated by the offenders’ anti-Black or anti-African American bias’’. (20) On September 14, 2017, President Don-ald J. Trump signed into law Senate Joint Resolution 49 (Public Law 115–58; 131 Stat. 1149), wherein Congress ‘‘condemn[ed] the racist violence and domestic terrorist attack that took place between August 11 and Au-gust 12, 2017, in Charlottesville, Virginia’’ and ‘‘urg[ed] the President and his adminis-tration to speak out against hate groups that espouse racism, extremism, xenophobia, anti-Semitism, and White supremacy; and use all resources available to the President and the President’s Cabinet to address the growing prevalence of those hate groups in the United States’’. (21) Senate Joint Resolution 49 (Public Law 115–58; 131 Stat. 1149) specifically took notice of ‘‘hundreds of torch-bearing White nationalists, White supremacists, Klansmen, and neo-Nazis [who] chanted racist, anti-Se-mitic, and anti-immigrant slogans and vio-lently engaged with counter-demonstrators on and around the grounds of the University of Virginia in Charlottesville’’ and that these groups ‘‘reportedly are organizing similar events in other cities in the United States and communities everywhere are con-cerned about the growing and open display of hate and violence being perpetrated by those groups’’.

ISCLOSURE OF STATISTICAL DATA OR  I
NFORMATION .— ‘‘(1) Data or information acquired by an agency under a pledge of confidentiality for exclusively statistical purposes shall not be disclosed by an agency in identifiable form, for any use other than an exclusively statis-tical purpose, except with the informed con-sent of the respondent. ‘‘(2) A disclosure pursuant to paragraph (1) is authorized only when the head of the agency approves such disclosure and the dis-closure is not prohibited by any other law. ‘‘(3) This section does not restrict or di-minish any confidentiality protections in law that otherwise apply to data or informa-tion acquired by an agency under a pledge of confidentiality for exclusively statistical purposes. ‘‘(d) R

Findings ‘‘The Congress finds the following: ‘‘(1) Federal statistics are an important source of information for public and private decision-makers such as policymakers, con-sumers, businesses, investors, and workers. ‘‘(2) Federal statistical agencies should continuously seek to improve their effi-ciency. Statutory constraints limit the abil-ity of these agencies to share data and thus to achieve higher efficiency for Federal sta-tistical programs. ‘‘(3) The quality of Federal statistics de-pends on the willingness of businesses to re-spond to statistical surveys. Reducing re-porting burdens will increase response rates, and therefore lead to more accurate charac-terizations of the economy. ‘‘(4) Enhanced sharing of business data among the Bureau of the Census, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics for exclusively statistical purposes will improve their ability to track more accurately the large and rapidly chang-ing nature of United States business. In par-ticular, the statistical agencies will be able to better ensure that businesses are consist-ently classified in appropriate industries, re-solve data anomalies, produce statistical samples that are consistently adjusted for the entry and exit of new businesses in a timely manner, and correct faulty reporting errors quickly and efficiently. ‘‘(5) Congress enacted the International In-vestment and Trade in Services Survey Act (Public Law 94–472), which allowed the Bu-reau of the Census, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics to share data on foreign-owned companies. The Act not only expanded detailed industry coverage from 135 industries to over 800 in-dustries with no increase in the data col-lected from respondents but also dem-onstrated how data sharing can result in the creation of valuable data products. ‘‘(6) With part B of this subchapter, the sharing of business data among the Bureau of the Census, the Bureau of Economic Anal-ysis, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics con-tinues to ensure the highest level of con-fidentiality for respondents to statistical surveys. ‘‘§ 3576. Designated statistical agencies ‘‘(a) PURPOSES .—The purposes of this sec-tion are the following: ‘‘(1) To authorize the sharing of business data among the Bureau of the Census, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and the Bu-reau of Labor Statistics for exclusively sta-tistical purposes. ‘‘(2) To reduce the paperwork burdens im-posed on businesses that provide requested information to the Federal Government. ‘‘(3) To improve the comparability and ac-curacy of Federal economic statistics by al-lowing the Bureau of the Census, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics to update sample frames, develop consistent classifications of estab-lishments and companies into industries, im-prove coverage, and reconcile significant dif-ferences in data produced by the three agen-cies. ‘‘(4) To increase understanding of the United States economy, especially for key industry and regional statistics, to develop more accurate measures of the impact of technology on productivity growth, and to enhance the reliability of the Nation’s most important economic indicators, such as the National Income and Product Accounts. ‘‘(b) R
ESPONSIBILITIES OF DESIGNATED STA-
TISTICAL AGENCIES .—The head of each of the Designated Statistical Agencies shall— ‘‘(1) identify opportunities to eliminate du-plication and otherwise reduce reporting burden and cost imposed on the public in providing information for statistical pur-poses; ‘‘(2) enter into joint statistical projects to improve the quality and reduce the cost of statistical programs; and ‘‘(3) protect the confidentiality of individ-ually identifiable information acquired for statistical purposes by adhering to safeguard principles, including— ‘‘(A) emphasizing to their officers, employ-ees, and agents the importance of protecting the confidentiality of information in cases where the identity of individual respondents can reasonably be inferred by either direct or indirect means; ‘‘(B) training their officers, employees, and agents in their legal obligations to protect the confidentiality of individually identifi-able information and in the procedures that must be followed to provide access to such information; ‘‘(C) implementing appropriate measures to assure the physical and electronic secu-rity of confidential data; ‘‘(D) establishing a system of records that identifies individuals accessing confidential data and the project for which the data were required; and ‘‘(E) being prepared to document their compliance with safeguard principles to other agencies authorized by law to monitor such compliance. ‘‘(c) SHARING OF BUSINESS DATA AMONG  D
ESIGNATED STATISTICAL AGENCIES .— ‘‘(1) I
N GENERAL .—A Designated Statistical Agency may provide business data in an identifiable form to another Designated Sta-tistical Agency under the terms of a written agreement among the agencies sharing the business data that specifies— ‘‘(A) the business data to be shared; ‘‘(B) the statistical purposes for which the business data are to be used; ‘‘(C) the officers, employees, and agents au-thorized to examine the business data to be shared; and ‘‘(D) appropriate security procedures to safeguard the confidentiality of the business data. ‘‘(2) R

ESPONSIBILITIES OF OFFICERS , EMPLOY -
EES, AND AGENTS .—Examination of business data in identifiable form shall be limited to the officers, employees, and agents author-ized to examine the individual reports in ac-cordance with written agreements pursuant to this section.

OTICE .—Whenever a written agree-ment concerns data that respondents were required by law to report and the respond-ents were not informed that the data could be shared among the Designated Statistical Agencies, for exclusively statistical pur-poses, the terms of such agreement shall be described in a public notice issued by the agency that intends to provide the data.

SA 4172. Mr. BOOZMAN (for Mr. T
HUNE ) proposed an amendment to the bill H.R. 5509, to direct the National Science Foundation to provide grants for research about STEM education ap-proaches and the STEM-related work-force, and for other purposes; as fol-lows: 
Strike all after the enacting clause and in-sert the following: 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Innovations in Mentoring, Training, and Apprenticeships Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: (1) To remain competitive in the global economy, foster greater innovation, and pro-vide a foundation for shared prosperity, the United States needs a workforce with the right mix of skills to meet the diverse needs of the economy. (2) Evidence indicates that the returns on investments in technical skills in the labor market are strong when students success-fully complete their education and gain cre-dentials sought by employers. (3) The responsibility for developing and sustaining a skilled technical workforce is fragmented across many groups, including educators, students, workers, employers, Federal, State, and local governments, civic associations, and other stakeholders. Such groups need to be able to coordinate and co-operate successfully with each other. (4) Coordination among students, commu-nity colleges, secondary and post-secondary institutions, and employers would improve educational outcomes. (5) Promising experiments currently un-derway may guide innovation and reform, but scalability of some of those experiments has not yet been tested. (6) Evidence suggests that integration of academic education, technical skills devel-opment, and hands-on work experience im-proves outcomes and return on investment for students in secondary and post-secondary education and for skilled technical workers in different career stages. (7) Outcomes show that mentoring can in-crease STEM student engagement and the rate of completion of STEM post-secondary degrees.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: (1) To remain competitive in the global economy, foster greater innovation, and pro-vide a foundation for shared prosperity, the United States needs a workforce with the right mix of skills to meet the diverse needs of the economy. (2) Evidence indicates that the returns on investments in technical skills in the labor market are strong when students success-fully complete their education and gain cre-dentials sought by employers.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES7948 December 19, 2018 
(3) The responsibility for developing and sustaining a skilled technical workforce is fragmented across many groups, including educators, students, workers, employers, Federal, State, and local governments, civic associations, and other stakeholders. Such groups need to be able to coordinate and co-operate successfully with each other. (4) Coordination among students, commu-nity colleges, secondary and post-secondary institutions, and employers would improve educational outcomes. (5) Promising experiments currently un-derway may guide innovation and reform, but scalability of some of those experiments has not yet been tested. (6) Evidence suggests that integration of academic education, technical skills devel-opment, and hands-on work experience im-proves outcomes and return on investment for students in secondary and post-secondary education and for skilled technical workers in different career stages. (7) Outcomes show that mentoring can in-crease STEM student engagement and the rate of completion of STEM post-secondary degrees.

RECOGNIZING DEVIN RICH AND KIERSTEN BARE FROM KALISPELL 
HON. GREG GIANFORTE 
OF MONTANA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, December 19, 2018 Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor siblings Devin Rich and Kiersten Bare of Kalispell for helping victims of the Woolsey and Camp fires recover from the devastation. A graduate of Flathead High School, Devin lives in Marina del Rey, California. While the nearby Woolsey Fire roared in early Novem-ber, he volunteered to help with the support efforts. Wearing protective gear and working in difficult circumstances, Devin helped victims of the fire search through the ash and rubble where their homes stood to salvage items dear to them. Driven by her compassion for animals, Kiersten, who lives in Kalispell, worked to re-unite lost pets with their owners. Kiersten spent hours online studying photos of the dis-placed animals to identify potential matches to help pet owners in their search. The Woolsey and Camp fires devastated California this year, claiming nearly 90 lives and destroying more than 14,000 homes. Devin and Kiersten are among the generous Americans who answered the call to serve others in their time of need. I commend all the firefighters, first responders, support workers, and volunteers who saved lives and helped those impacted by these catastrophic fires. Mr. Speaker, for their compassion for the victims of California’s disastrous Woolsey and Camp fires and their commitment to helping in the recovery, I recognize Devin Rich and Kiersten Bare for their spirit of Montana.

RECOGNIZING SUPERVISOR RANDY HANVELT 
HON. TOM McCLINTOCK 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, December 19, 2018 Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Randy Hanvelt for his devoted serv-ice as a Tuolumne County Supervisor. Supervisor Hanvelt was first elected to serve the 2nd District of Tuolumne County in 2010 and has worked incessantly on behalf of his constituents ever since. In his years of service, Randy Hanvelt has transformed the job of a County Supervisor. He has relentlessly pursued a better way of life for the residents of Tuolumne County; never missing an opportunity to share his message, express his passion, and inspire others to advocate for rural issues. In addition to serving on more than a dozen regional committees and commissions, Super-visor Hanvelt was elected Second Vice Chair to the Rural County Representatives of Cali-fornia in December 2016. He served as both the Second and First Vice Chairs during his tenure as Tuolumne County Supervisor. In July 2018, Supervisor Hanvelt was appointed chair of the National Association of Counties’ Public Lands Policy Steering Committee. In 2017, the California Forestry Association awarded Randy the title of ‘‘Conservationist of the Year.’’ Supervisor Hanvelt has worked tirelessly on behalf of his district and the entirety of Tuolumne County. He has advocated locally and nationally for full funding of Payments in Lieu of Taxes, the Secure Rural Schools Pro-gram, and Forest Health projects, including Rim Fire Recovery and the County’s Master Stewardship Agreement with the U.S. Forest Service. Randy has also been an instrumental leader in developing programs and securing funding to eradicate dead and hazardous trees. Supervisor Randy Hanvelt has truly been at the forefront in making Tuolumne County a more prosperous place. He has set a new standard for local leaders and his service to the community is incomparable. f 
IN APPRECIATION OF PAUL THOMPSON UPON HIS RETIRE-MENT FROM THE GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, December 19, 2018 Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speak-er, I rise to express my appreciation of Mr. Paul Thompson upon his retirement from the Government Accountability Office. Over the past four decades, Mr. Thompson has worked on a diverse range of issues in the Legislative and Executive Branches. Mr. Thompson began his federal career in 1977, as a staff member to the then-U.S. House Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries. He then joined the Department of Energy’s Of-fice of General Counsel in 1980 as a Law Clerk. In 1982, he left the Department of En-ergy and joined the Commodity Futures Trad-ing Commission (CFTC) as an Attorney-Advi-sor. In 1987, Mr. Thompson took a position in the private sector, but, just three years later, he began working at what we now know as the Government Accountability Office. But in 1991, it was called the General Accounting Of-fice. Over the past 27 years, Mr. Thompson has helped GAO carry out its core mission of sup-porting Congress in meeting its constitutional responsibilities and to help improve the per-formance and ensure the accountability of the federal government for the benefit of the American people. In my capacity as the top Democrat on the Committee on Homeland Se-curity Committee, I have found him to be a re-liable resource to our staff in our efforts to carry out vigorous oversight and appreciate his personal commitment to providing staff with valuable insights and information. Mr. Speaker, you may be wondering wheth-er Mr. Thompson and I are related. We are not related, but we share a commitment to ac-countability and oversight. We thank Mr. Thompson for his service to our country and wish him the very best. f 
PASSING OF RON BARTOLI 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, December 19, 2018 Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, northern California lost a great leader, visionary, family man and true patriot in Ron Bartoli. Ron’s success as a businessman included building a thriving international company. His passion for the U.S. Air Force and its critical missions, and the men and women serving at BEALE AFB was relentless and sincere. Much of the success and growth of missions at BEALE AFB since 1986 can be attributed to Ron’s efforts. Ron loved people and he spent quality time with everyone he came to know. He was an accomplished pilot, sport fisherman and he loved to play golf. He was a longtime Board Member and past Board Chair at Sierra Cen-tral Credit Union.

IT IS GOING TO TAKE MORE THAN SANCTIONS TO REVERSE IRAN’S EXPANSIONISM 
HON. TED POE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, December 19, 2018 Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, across the Middle East today, armed thugs backed by Iran are entrenching themselves in local com-munities, undermining democratic aspirations, and stockpiling weapons in preparation for war against America’s allies. Sadly, it’s nothing new. For more than a decade, Iran has con-structed a formidable array of foreign legions that exploit corruption and instability to sub-jugate millions to Tehran’s will. In response, the President has rightly restored sanctions on the Islamic Republic and prioritized confronting its regional activity. But to reverse the gains Iran and its proxies have made over recent years, America and its allies must go beyond sanctions. Sanctions are designed to deny resources to Iran that are used to support terrorism, de-velop nuclear weapons, and conduct human rights abuses at home. We know this strategy has had some success in the past stalling Iran’s efforts and forcing Tehran to come to the bargaining table. The Obama Administra-tion, however, gave away the farm to the Mullahs, removing many of the sanctions that

brought Tehran to heel and opening the door for Russia, China, and the Europeans to do business in Iran. Obama also ceded physical territory to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and its proxies by not con-testing their growing activity in Syria and Yemen and withdrawing U.S. forces from Iraq. The resulting instability led to ISIS’s rise and a secure land route from Tehran to Beirut from which the IRGC could move recruits and weapons to Israel’s borders. These policies of appeasement have created a powder keg that could erupt into regional war. At a recent hearing before my sub-committee, the Coordinator for Counterter-rorism at the State Department, Amb. Nathan Sales, testified that Iran spends $1 billion-per- year funding its various terrorist proxies in the Middle East. This sum pales in comparison to how much we spend to deploy forces to the region, assist allies, conduct diplomacy, and gather intelligence. Yet, Iran is gaining ground. How is this possible? For one reason, Iran’s march of terror is cheap and adaptive, using low-cost arms, violent coercion, disinformation, and crime to operate. Meanwhile, we chose to play by the rules and attempt to rebuild what Iran and other terrorists destroy. It’s far cheap-er and easier to destroy than to build. And un-like our efforts during the early Cold War, in the Middle East we are attempting to build or reinforce institutions that either never existed or are plagued with corruption. But this doesn’t mean American taxpayer dollars are spent in vain. For example, few would argue that the U.S.’s largest foreign as-sistance program, $3.8 billion-per-year in mili-tary financing to Israel, is money wasted. Rather, that money ensures Israel holds a military edge over Iran and its terrorist allies thus preventing the Mullahs from ever achiev-ing one of their core objectives: the extermi-nation of Israel. Just weeks ago, Palestinian terrorists backed by Iran, fired dozens of rock-ets into Israel. 120 of those rockets were incepted by Iron Dome, a missile defense sys-tem paid for and jointly developed through American assistance. Moreover, the Israelis are not sitting idly by as Iran masses forces on its northern borders. Since 2013, Israeli warplanes and missiles, subsidized by U.S. taxpayers, have struck dozens of Iranian and Hezbollah convoys transporting weapons to Lebanon or the Golan Heights. Action by Israel is effective but limited. For example, recent reports indicate the IRGC is utilizing the territory it controls in Iraq and Syria to position ballistic missiles that can tar-get Israel, Saudi Arabia, and our forces in the region. Finding and striking these missiles is an enormous challenge for Israel and could have ramifications for Americans stationed in those countries. Instead, it is up to America to contest Iran’s grip on these arenas by empow-ering local actors and demonstrating American resolve. So far, however, the State Department has done the opposite by resisting Congressional efforts to designate Iran’s most lethal Iraqi proxies, such as Asa’ib Ahl al-Haq and Harakat Hezbollah al-Nujaba, and shutting the American consulate in Basra, Iraq. Such ac-tion demonstrates to Iran that it need only threaten an American diplomatic post and the U.S. will retreat, ceding more space for them and their proxies. Tragically in the case of Basra, we are abandoning Iraqis who coura-geously took to the streets to protest Iran’s meddling in their country. Simultaneously U.S. forces in Syria are trying to prevent a war be-tween our Kurdish and Turkish allies that has allowed ISIS to survive and Iranian weapon shipments to pass by unmolested. Only when we tackle these local challenges can we dislodge Iran. To do so requires us to make hard choices and strategies with poten-tially more costs. But if countering Iran’s ex-pansionism is truly our objective, we must show commitment to partners on the ground that we are willing to confront Iran alongside them. Until then a storm is gathering that will inevitably pull Americans back into a long and difficult war. And that’s just the way it is.

IN HONOR OF MR. RICHARD L. CLEMENS’ LIFELONG COMMIT-MENT TO PUBLIC SERVICE 
HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER 
OF MISSOURI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, December 19, 2018 Mr. CLEAVER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of a dedicated community leader and public servant of Missouri’s Fifth Congressional District. In life, Mr. Richard L. Clemens demonstrated tremendous compas-sion, bravery, and selflessness through his commitment to family and civil service. Mr. Clemens was born to Ruby Weber Clemens and John R. ‘‘Jack’’ Clemens on April 4, 1945 in Marshall, Missouri. A former graduate of Marshall High School, Mr. Clemens would go on to receive a Bachelor of Science in Accounting from Missouri Valley College in 1967. Through his newly acquired degree, he would go on to serve as an auditor for the United States Department of Agri-culture Inspector General, where shortly there-after he would meet his wife and lifelong part-ner, Nellie. Born and raised in Marshall, Mr. Clemens was well-known to the people of his hometown as many were his friends, neigh-bors, and members of his congregation. When called upon, Mr. Clemens stood tall and proud to serve his country during the Viet-nam War in 1968, and again in 1969. His service to our country didn’t end there, as he continued to show pride and dedication to as-sisting his brothers in arms by serving as a member and officer of the American Legion Post No. 191 and as the Senior Vice-Com-mander of the V.F.W. Post No. 2646. Mr. Clemens had many goals in life apart from serving our country and the people as an auditor. From 1975 to his retirement, he owned and operated Clemens Circle C Farm while holding various organizational and local governmental positions. His interests and de-termination led him to hold many positions such as Chairman of the Saline County Re-publican Central Committee, President of the Saline County Fair Board, and the Saline County Extension Council. Furthermore, his dream of serving his community in an elected position was fulfilled in 2016, when he was elected the Saline County Northern District Commissioner. These notable positions are only a few of the many roles Mr. Clemens has held within the community, yet they illustrate his unremitting passion and devotion for the people and community he represented. He is preceded in death by his parents and the love of his life, Nellie. He is survived by his two daughters, Anna Clemens Gass and Rebecca Clemens; his four grandchildren, Abi-gail, Vivian, Simeon, and Lilian; his brother, George Clemens; and his nieces, nephews, and cousins. Though he is dearly missed, his legacy of love, respect, and high esteem by his family, peers, and community remain. Mr. Clemens is revered for his impressive leader-ship, his lively personality, and commitment to his community. Mr. Speaker, please join me and all of Mis-souri’s Fifth Congressional District in honoring the memory and life of Mr. Richard L. Clemens. His upstanding contributions and service to the Marshall community and our country are beyond worthy of this commemo-ration. It is with great respect that I urge all my colleagues and fellow citizens across the country to join me in showing our appreciation to Mr. Clemens and sending our deepest con-dolences for his family, friends, and commu-nity. f 
HONORING BRUCE M ACRAE 
HON. JEFF DENHAM 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, December 19, 2018 Mr. DENHAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge and honor Long Beach, Cali-fornia legend, Bruce MacRae. Bruce is a long-time employee of the United Parcel Service (UPS) and is currently Vice President of State Government Affairs for California and the Western Region of the United States. In this role is where our lives originally intersected. My relationship with Bruce has kept me grounded during my time in elected office and his friendship is one that will continue (even though our days of smoking cigars are less frequent). Bruce grew up in Long Beach and grad-uated from Wilson High School. He started his career with UPS in the area, at the Anaheim package facility in 1979. Bruce rose through the ranks as a driver and took on a manage-ment position in 1987 which was the catalyst to his success as a Government Relations ex-ecutive. As a result of Bruce’s professional success and his free loving personality, philanthropy has been a natural pursuit. Bruce is a Long Beach City College Board member, Long Beach Police Foundation president, and gen-erous donor to the Long Beach City College’s athletic department. These accolades along with his big personality donned him the title of ‘‘Legend’’ in a Long Beach Post article in 2015. As with any life there are ups and downs. In 2015, Bruce suffered a heart attack while in Phoenix for work. It was a grounding experi-ence for everyone that knows and cares about Bruce. At that moment, we all truly realized how much Bruce means to the Long Beach community and the level of respect that peo-ple have for him. As you would expect from someone of Bruce’s character, he recovered from open heart surgery seamlessly. I am proud to call Bruce a friend and I am grateful for his companionship throughout my years in public service. Mr. Speaker, please join me in honoring and commending Bruce MacRae for his contributions to Southern Cali-fornia, our state, and nation.

PASSING OF CHARLES C. MESSICK 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, December 19, 2018 Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, well known farmer, beloved family patriarch and loyal friend, Charles C. Messick, born in Yuba City, CA, on April 28, 1935, passed away Novem-ber 25, 2018. Chuck was active in many farm and community organizations. He was instru-mental in organizing the California Prune Bar-gaining Association, as well as the Walnut Bargaining Association and was a Director on the California Peach Association Board. He was elected to the Farm Credit Board of Di-rectors, and served as Chairman of the Board for a term. Governor Ronald Reagan ap-pointed him to the Yuba Sutter Fair Board in 1972. He was a charter member of Sutter Buttes Sunrise Rotary, a Paul Harris Fellow and served as President in 2004 through 2006. He looked forward each year to acting as marshal of the Fairway to Health golf tour-nament benefiting the Rideout Hospital Foun-dation. As his five children were growing up, Chuck was an active volunteer and leader in the Hallwood 4-H Club, Marysville Little League and Marysville High School Boosters’ Club. He is survived by his wife Shiela; sisters, Marilyn Kirby (Sparky) of Yuba City and Carol Howell of Sparks, Nevada; daughters Sharyl Messick-Menconi (Jim) and Beth Aldridge (Chuck) of Yuba City; sons, Charles Messick of LaPorte, Michael Messick (Lore´) and Jon Messick (Amy) of Marysville; grandchildren, Andrea Brown, David Brown, Shayla West, Kelly Messick, Mattea Spradling, Jim Messick, Matthew Messick, Ben Neighbors, Rachel Dawson, Kayla Legaspi, Charlie Messick, Hailey Messick, Thomas Messick, Jackson Messick, Owen Messick, Noah Messick, Sydnia Aldridge, Kate Aldridge and Sarah Al-dridge. He had twelve great-grandchildren.

HONORING THE CAREER OF JERRY O’BANION 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, December 19, 2018 Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the career of Merced County Supervisor Jerry O’Banion. On December 18, 2018, Mr. O’Banion retired from the Merced County Board of Supervisors after 28 incredible years of service. Mr. O’Banion was born and raised in Dos Palos, California on the westside of Merced County. Having grown up seeing his father, Emory O’Banion, serve as a county supervisor for the westside communities, Mr. O’Banion saw the importance of public service early on. In 1964, he graduated from Dos Palos High School and continued his education at Fresno State, where he earned a BA in General Sciences and an Agricultural Education Cre-dential in 1969. After serving 6 years in the National Guard and as a 4–H youth advisor in Fresno County from 1969 to 1973, Mr. O’Banion returned to Merced County where he would soon begin his distinguished career of public service. Mr. O’Banion was elected to the Dos Palos City Council in 1980 and served in that role until being elected as the city’s mayor in 1987. Three years later, he was elected to the Merced County Board of Supervisors to rep-resent the county’s westside communities of Dos Palos, Los Banos, and Santa Nella. Dur-ing his time on the Board of Supervisors, Mr. O’Banion has served as chairman numerous times, including this year of his retirement. Mr. O’Banion’s 28-year tenure on the Merced County Board of Supervisors makes him the second-longest serving county super-visor in the State of California. In each of the offices Mr. O’Banion has held, he has had the honor to represent the places where he grew up. At the same time, he has also raised an amazing family in those communities. Together, Mr. O’Banion and his wife of 50 years, Dollie, have three children and eight grandchildren, all of whom have always been supportive of his service to the community and helped to carry on the proud legacy of the O’Banion family. In retirement, I am sure Mr. O’Banion will continue to exhibit the same level of unwaver-ing leadership and commitment present throughout his career as he continues to serve the various local organizations he’s involved with and his family’s business, O’Banion Ranches, Diversified Farming. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in honoring the exemplary career of a Merced County Supervisor Jerry O’Banion. It is both fitting and appropriate that we honor a man who has spent a lifetime advocating for Merced County’s westside. I wish him and his family the best as he retires from a highly ac-complished career in public service. f 
IN RECOGNITION OF SUE DIGRE 
HON. JACKIE SPEIER 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, December 19, 2018 Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Sue Digre for her 16 outstanding years of service on the Pacifica City Council, three times as mayor. Sue’s compassion for others and her love of community have shaped her public service and dedication to keep Pacifica a livable and lovable town on the edge of the Pacific Ocean. It is her firm belief that Pacifica’s environment with stunning ocean views, coastal hills, and family-friendly neigh-borhoods is its most valuable asset. Sue deserves much credit for the current upgrades and repaving of Highway 1 by Caltrans. This ambitious project will renew ten miles of Highway 1 from Gray Whale Cove to the Highway 1/280 interchange, the first time in over 20 years that the main road through Pacifica will be repaved end-to-end instead of in sections. The finished project will be hugely beneficial to the 250th Commemoration of the Ohlone-Portola Heritage Trail in 2019, an event Sue has lobbied for since 2014. Sue was also instrumental in helping the Pacifica Historical Society turn the Little Brown Church into a beautiful coastal museum and event space. The Manor Beach Park, brain-child of the late Councilman Jim Vreeland, was completed in part due to Sue’s efforts. A tireless advocate for our youth, Sue feels it is important that they be given an oppor-tunity to speak for themselves. She helped create the Youth Advisory Board in 2011, and a representative of the board now has a seat on the Parks, Beaches and Recreation Com-mission. She supported TRUST, Teens are Unbelievably Strong Together, in their work surveying transportation needs for youth and seniors which temporarily led to shuttles in Pacifica. Sue understands that small businesses are the lifeblood of her town and has consistently listened to their owners’ needs. She also spearheaded Pacifica’s membership in the San Mateo County/Silicon Valley Visitors Bu-reau which brings the town attention from visi-tors throughout the region. While Pacifica’s geography makes it one of the most spectacular communities in San Mateo County, it also makes it vulnerable to sea level rise and coastal erosion. In 2016, fierce El Nino storms pounded the coast and damaged the seawall. Sue, along with the en-tire council and city staff, reached out to the City of San Francisco, the State of California and the federal government for assistance. To this day, my office is deeply involved in finding solutions to these ongoing challenges. My office has also worked closely with Sue and the council to reduce the relentless air-plane noise that has been plaguing Pacifica neighborhoods for years. Sue has been a fierce advocate for Pacificans on the disas-trous health impacts of airplane noise that the FAA must address. Susan Anne Lockard was born in Youngs-town, Ohio and, as a Navy child, attended schools all across the country and world, from Ohio to North Carolina to Hawaii to Japan to Illinois to California. She earned her B.A. in Bi-ology with a minor in Philosophy and a Cali-fornia State Life Credential from the Women’s College of Notre Dame in Belmont. She start-ed teaching general education classes throughout California for the Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur in 1960. In 1968 she moved to Burlingame and taught at Mercy elementary and high schools until 1999. In 1977, she married Erick L. Digre. They have four children, Colleen, Sean, Michael and Scott. Sean and Michael serve in the mili-tary and were deployed after 9/11. Sue reached out to other mothers through the local paper, the Pacifica Tribune, to co-found the Pacifica Military Moms. This effort led to its in-corporation as the San Mateo County Blue Star Moms. Since 1999, Sue has served as the Family Support Services and Advocacy Department Director for PARCA, Partners and Advocates for Remarkable Children and Adults. She has also volunteered for numerous organizations including the Burlingame Civic Action Forum, the Pacifica Open Space Committee, and the Sierra Club. As is obvious from this list, Sue is deeply dedicated to serving her community and supporting those in need. Mr. Speaker, I ask the House of Represent-atives to rise with me to honor a great com-munity leader and personal friend, Sue Digre. We hail her contributions to Pacifica residents and visitors that will remain long after she re-tires from the city council. It’s been my privi-lege to work with her for many years and I have no doubt that she will continue her civic engagement in her beloved home town.

INTRODUCTION OF THE LOW-WAGE FEDERAL CONTRACTOR EM-PLOYEE BACK PAY ACT 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, December 19, 2018 Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today, I intro-duce the Low-Wage. Federal Contractor Em-ployee Back Pay Act to grant back pay to fed-erally contracted retail, food, custodial and se-curity service workers who are furloughed dur-ing a federal government shutdown this fiscal year (fiscal year 2019). This bill applies to all three branches of the federal government. After the 2013 government shutdown, federal workers received back pay, but not federal contract workers. While I believe that all fed-eral employees and federal contract workers should receive back pay after a shutdown, we know that we cannot get Congress to make whole all who are hurt by a shutdown. My bill focuses specifically on low-wage federal con-tract workers, some of whom work here on the Capitol grounds providing Members of Con-gress and congressional staff with daily serv-ices, because these are the workers most like-ly to be irretrievably hurt by lost wages during a shutdown. Many federal contract workers earn little more than the minimum wage and receive few, if any, benefits. While some are unionized with a little better wage, all are the lowest-paid workers in the federal government and should not be penalized because Congress has failed to do its job to keep the government func-tioning. Congress, historically, has provided back pay to federal employees, who often work in the same buildings as these low-wage contract workers, furloughed during govern-ment shutdowns—but not to low-wage con-tract workers. However, both groups of work-ers deserve to be made whole after shut-downs. I recognize, of course, that contract workers are employees of contractors, but the distinction between federal workers and, at least, the lowest-paid contract workers, who, for example, keep buildings clean, fails when it comes to a deliberate government shut-down. Unlike many other contractors, those who employ low-wage service workers have little latitude to help make up for lost wages. Low-wage, federally contracted service work-ers can least afford the loss of pay during a shutdown and should not have to go without pay while everyone else in their federal build-ings likely receives back pay. The nation’s capital is the high-profile home of the federal government’s complicity with contractors who pay low wages through leases and contracts with federal agencies. At least this legislation would provide some parity to their low-wage federal contract workers. I strongly urge my colleagues to support the legislation.

IN RECOGNITION OF MR. ANDREW FITZGERALD 
HON. WILLIAM R. KEATING 
OF MASSACHUSETTS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, December 19, 2018 Mr. KEATING. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the life of Mr. Andrew Fitzgerald of the United States Coast Guard, a hero and beloved member of the community who passed away at the age of eighty-seven. Andrew Fitzgerald, a true American hero, lived an exemplary life of service, dem-onstrating a true commitment to our nation and our community. Born in Whitinsville, Mas-sachusetts on March 19, 1931, he was always motivated to better his community. As a young man he joined the United States Coast Guard. He would then go on to be a part of the great-est small boat rescue in Coast Guard history and receive the Gold Lifesaving Medal. On February 18, 1952, Mr. Fitzgerald and the crewmen aboard CG–36500 responded to two large oil tankers in distress, the Fort Mer- cer and the Pendleton. They showed exem-plary skill as they navigated through high winds, lightning, and monstrous seas. While on their way to the Pendleton, the severe thrashing of the waves caused their engine to stall. Mr. Fitzgerald demonstrated extreme heroism as he crawled into their engine com-partment to restart it every time, so they could continue on their mission. Once they arrived at the Pendleton, one by one, they took 32 sur-vivors off the pitching stern and brought them safely to Chatham Harbor. Following his service in the Coast Guard, Mr. Fitzgerald went on to have a successful business career in Colorado. He married Glo-ria Frabotta in 1956, and together they had a daughter, Dawn and a son, Michael. Mr. Fitz-gerald dedicated his life to caring for his loved ones, including volunteering at his local church. He was always ready to lend a help-ing hand to anyone who crossed his path. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to honor the life of Andrew Fitzgerald. I ask that my colleagues join me in remembering his courageous ac-tions, and those of his crewmen, that saved so many lives. f

OF PENNSYLVANIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, December 19, 2018 Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, this year marks the 100th anniversary of the signing of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. This landmark law has protected cherished birds throughout North America while unifying environmental-ists, hunters, and scientists for generations. In New Hope, Pennsylvania, supporters of environmental preservation are gathering at the Bucks County Audubon Society at Honey Hollow on December 19, 2018, to celebrate the ‘‘Year of the Bird’’ in honor of the centen-nial celebration of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. It gives me immense pride to stand with them and their commitment to environmental stewardship for all animal species.

UPON THE OCCASION OF THE DE-PARTURE OF DONNA RUTHER-FORD FROM THE EAST PALO ALTO CITY COUNCIL 
HON. JACKIE SPEIER 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, December 19, 2018 Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Donna Rutherford who is leaving the city council of East Palo Alto after a total of 25 years of service to the residents of her re-markable community. Donna is a steady voice of reason and a warm, committed person who welcomes all who enjoy her city’s diversity, opportunity, and vitality. East Palo Alto is a city in the midst of great change. As a town of nearly 30,000, the com-munity is at the crossroads of two major high-ways, deep in the heart of Silicon Valley. Donna Rutherford understands that the eco-nomic forces shaping East Palo Alto must not be allowed to change the diverse population of the community but instead be harnessed to create opportunity for all its residents. Central to opportunity is housing, and as a councilwoman Donna Rutherford advocated for and supported the construction of afford-able housing for all populations. While Mayor, she approved of, and then joined in turning the ground for, a long-awaited senior project— University Avenue Senior Housing. On the council, she consistently spoke about the need to develop the city’s parcel on Weeks Street, a project that will come to fruition in the next few years thanks in part to her vote. She also supported the use of a city-controlled lot that will soon become a supervised, nighttime parking location for residents living in their rec-reational vehicles. Her dedication to opportunity did not begin with the council. As a school volunteer while her children were in elementary school, she attended school board meetings so frequently that some thought she was a district em-ployee. She ran for the school board and was successful, serving from 1988 to 2000, includ-ing some of the most difficult years of school funding by the state. At one point, students approached the city council with a study showing that East Palo Alto had more liquor stores per capita than surrounding communities. The council took note, and Donna celebrated their investment of time and energy, noting years later that stu-dents have so much potential to make a dif-ference. Liquor stores have gradually given way to a thriving retail center, a hotel and of-fice complex and other improvements to East Palo Alto’s quality of life. As a councilmember, Donna Rutherford rep-resented the city on the San Mateo County Vector Control District board, as an alternate on C/CAG—an agency formed from cities throughout San Mateo County, on the county library board, and the wastewater manage-ment board. She is also the city’s alternate on numerous other important boards impacting the quality of life of residents. Mr. Speaker and Members, East Palo Alto is definitely a city on the move. It will miss the leadership of Donna Rutherford, but her moral authority and authentic voice of concern, filled with wisdom, will continue for many years to come. She once noted of her childhood neigh-borhood, Hunters Point, that she loved living near the bay. The winds sometimes blow hard across both Hunters Point and East Palo Alto, two communities with a vast bay shoreline, but the winds will never extinguish the will to serve that lives within the heart of Donna Rutherford. Donna Rutherford is a friend and colleague whose guidance I will miss as East Palo Alto continues to evolve. I know she will still be available to offer her sage advice. As she retires from the council, I wish her, her husband, Joe, and her children Trevor, Roxanne, and Damaris well in the years to come and we know that new adventures await this relentless leader of East Palo Alto.

IN APPRECIATION OF SACHA HAN FOR HER DEDICATED CAREER OF PUBLIC SERVICE 
HON. EDWARD R. ROYCE 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, December 19, 2018 Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise to today to recognize one of my longest serv-ing staff members—Sacha Han. Sacha grew up in Fullerton, California in the heart of my Congressional District. She came to my office as a High School student, seeking to intern and learn more about the government. We don’t take many High School students as interns, but Sacha was smart, poised, and wise beyond her years, and she was a great addition to my District Office. When Sacha graduated from High School, she came East to attend the George Washington University, right here in Washington, D.C. Once again, Sacha interned in our office, doing such a good job that we hired her for a full-time staff position upon her graduation from college. Sacha became such a key part of my staff, that when she announced that she was leav-ing the office to attend Nursing School, we persuaded her to continue to work part-time while she attended school. She not only con-tinued through nursing school, but she has re-mained on my staff to this day—20 years after she first walked into my District Office. Sacha is a joy to work with, and I am grate-ful for her service to the constituents of the 39th District of California, to my office, and to the House of Representatives. In addition to working two jobs, she is also a wife to Eduardo, and a mother to Bianca and Liam. I know that they too are very proud of Sacha. I thank Sacha, and wish her and her family all the best. f 
PERSECUTION OF THE BAHA’I 
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, December 19, 2018 Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise to condemn Iran’s state-sponsored persecution of its Baha’i minority. While the global community is rightfully con-cerned about Iran’s ties to international ter-rorism and its destabilizing activities in the re-gion, we must not forget those who struggle for religious freedom and basic civil liberties in Iran. As the largest non-Muslim religious minority community in Iran, the Baha’i people have long been subjected to severe religious perse-cution by the Iranian regime. Several of its leaders have been arrested, and members have been executed. According to the 2018 International Religious Freedom Report, Ira-nian authorities have arbitrarily detained over 1,000 Baha’is over the past decade. The Baha’i people are routinely and system-atically discriminated against on the basis of religion. Since 2014, officials have infringed on the economic pursuits of the Baha’i by closing over 600 of their shops. In addition, Baha’i children are regularly de-nied access to schools and higher education. Even if they are permitted to attend school, they are not free to learn about their religion or participate in religious practice. If they do, they face harassment and potentially expul-sion. The discrimination and persecution of this community is shameful and inexcusable. The social teachings of the Baha’i Faith—including the equality of all humans, regardless of gen-der, race, or class, and the principle of each individual’s responsibility to investigate the truth—are universal values that should be guaranteed. These are human rights we must protect. The United States and the international community must not ignore this egregious abuse and blatant discrimination against the Iranian Baha’i community. We must stand up to the Iranian regime and hold it accountable for its actions. By passing H. Res. 274, we shine a light on the persecution of the Baha’i, and hopefully move us one step closer to true religious free-dom in Iran.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, December 19, 2018 Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Dr. Hans Mumm for his govern-ment service and significant contributions to the U.S. Military’s Information Operations.

future uses. This September, Dr. Mumm will be celebrating his 50th birthday. Dr. Mumm began his military career as an enlisted service member. He gained notoriety for his leadership role in ‘‘Operation Iraqi Free-dom’’ as the officer in charge of the ‘‘Iraqi Re-gime Playing Cards; CENTCOM’s Top 55 Most Wanted List.’’ The Defense Intelligence Agency praised this Information Operations mission as one of the most successful cam-paigns in the agency’s history. Dr. Mumm was recognized as one of the ‘‘Ten Outstanding Young Americans’’ and awarded the National Defense PAC ‘‘American Patriot Ingenuity A ward’’ for his service during ‘‘Operation Iraqi Freedom’’. After serving in the enlisted ranks and sub-sequently as a U.S. Army Captain, Dr. Mumm was medically discharged in 2010, becoming a Wounded Warrior. Following the completion of his active service duties, Dr. Mumm has con-tinued to achieve remarkable feats. In June of 2014, Dr. Mumm was awarded the Excep-tional Performance Award from the CIA for his work as a branch chief. In this capacity, he oversaw the development of the Continuous Monitoring Branch (CMB) and transformed this technology into an integral part of the CIA’s cyber security framework. Over the course of his career, Dr. Mumm has earned twenty-three personal military rib-bons and combat medals. He is also the au-thor of two international bestselling books de-tailing the leadership challenges and opportu-nities in the fields of technical investigation and military intelligence. In addition to his cur-rent job at the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency, Dr. Mumm serves as an adjunct pro-fessor for the California University of Pennsyl-vania (CALU) and the American Military Uni-versity (AMU). Mr. Speaker, I ask you to join me in recog-nizing Dr. Hans Mumm for his acts of patriot-ism that have greatly benefitted our country as he celebrates his 50th birthday.

CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF ALMA NEWSOM FORNAL 
HON. PAUL COOK 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, December 19, 2018 Mr. COOK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to rec-ognize and remember the outstanding life of Alma Newsom Fornal, 1st lieutenant of the U.S. Army Air Corp. Mrs. Fornal, born in 1920, graduated from the University of Arkansas. Upon graduation she moved to Mississippi to be with her father, where she then took up flying. In 1943 she joined the Army Air Corps as a member of the pioneering group called the Women Air Force Service Pilots (WASPs), making her one of the first women allowed to fly military aircraft. These trailblazing pilots were an integral part of the World War II war effort. Her contribu-tions as a test pilot enabled safer flights of the AT–6 for male pilots serving overseas. In 2009 she was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal by President Barack Obama. Alma Newsom Fornal was laid to rest today December 19, 2018. Her dedication to serving our nation in its time of need is due the utmost respect and admiration, and her place in his-tory and time of service will be honored. On behalf of the United States House of Rep-resentatives, I thank her for her patriotism and pioneering spirit which have paved the way for future generations. f 
PRESIDENT MOON IS GOING SOFT ON LITTLE KIM 
HON. TED POE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, December 19, 2018 Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, it’s been a year since North Korea tested a nuclear-capa-ble ballistic missile. After successive years of increasing missile and nuclear weapon testing, the fact that none occurred in 2018 is remark-able progress. Even more so when we recall that talk of imminent war on the Korean Penin-sula was echoing throughout the media just a year ago. This retreat from the nuclear brink would not be possible without President Trump’s bold diplomatic efforts. However, with negotiations to achieve verifiable denuclearization still ongoing, the maximum pressure campaign that brought Kim Jong-Un to the table must continue. Unfortunately, it appears at risk due to South Korea’s dovish president. The current talks with North Korea are a game of nuclear chicken. President Trump’s approach ties intense international sanctions with diplomatic engagement that, if successful, provide the North Korean regime an economic life-line if it commits to irreversible dismantle-ment of its nuclear weapons program. But success hinges on comprehensive sanctions remaining in place until Kim Jong-Un formally makes that pledge and demonstrates verifiable steps towards denuclearization. Until now, Kim has only agreed to further talks and taken minor steps to show good faith, such as halt-ing weapon tests, closing the Punggye-ri nu-clear test site, and releasing American hos-tages. While encouraging, negotiations con-tinue with the hope of achieving more sub-stantive action, including a declared inventory of its full nuclear program. Here, intelligence reports seem to indicate that the North’s nu-clear and missile programs may actually be continuing to develop in secret. President Trump, therefore, has kept sanc-tions in place as negotiations continue. With-drawing some sanctions too early would disincentivize the regime from agreeing to complete dismantlement—a mistake that was made in past negotiations. The President has also permitted talks to continue so long as the North Koreans engage in constructive dia-logue. In August, when Kim’s regime ap-peared to be stalling, he canceled a planned meeting between the regime and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. This action sent a clear signal that we won’t be gamed and that the re-gime risks losing its only opportunity towards having sanctions removed. Negotiations have since resumed, with the North agreeing in Oc-tober to allow inspectors to visit the Punggye- ri nuclear site. Conditioning talks and standing firm on sanctions ultimately is the only way this process will work. Kim, on the other hand likely believes that he can wait-out the nego-tiations by alternating between stalling and piecemeal concessions until the U.S. and its allies tire or agree to a softer deal that re-moves sanctions. The regime will then quietly cheat, as they have before. This time, however, it appears that South Korea’s President Moon Jae-in will be the first to blink. In October—just a week after negotia-tions produced approval for inspections at Punggye-ri—President Moon conducted a tour of Europe where he urged allies to loosen sanctions on the Kim regime. Luckily, our Eu-ropean friends denied Moon’s request, know-ing that North Korea still has a ways to go be-fore verifiable denuclearization is achieved. Mr. Moon’s attempts to break the maximum pressure campaign, as well as the unity be-tween the U.S. and its European allies, sug-gests that Little Kim may have found his mark and is exploiting Moon’s naı¨ve sensibilities. For months, President Moon has sought to court Little Kim hoping to reduce tensions be-tween the two Koreas. In September, he ap-proved reconciliation deals with the Kim re-gime that pledged the withdrawal of guard posts along the de-militarized zone and res-toration of some economic ties between the two countries. The South has since reversed its willingness to reopen Kaesong, a joint in-dustrial center where South Korean compa-nies employ workers from the North, citing a lack of progress on denuclearization. Had Moon’s plan to restore economic ties through Kaesong gone forward, South Korea may have found itself in violation on United Nations sanctions. But Moon has moved forward with other projects, including a program to improve North Korea’s rail network and link it with the South. An initial study of the North’s rail system was approved last week by the U.N. Security Council following pressure from the White House to seek approval. Nonetheless, Moon’s separate diplomatic maneuvers and premature offers of economic opportunities are likely en-couraging the Kim regime to slow negotiations and steps towards denuclearization. With so much still at stake, the U.S. and its allies must present a united and stern front to pressure North Korea into accepting complete denuclearization. Little Kim has to see that maintaining any aspect of his nuclear weap-ons program is a no-win situation because crippling sanctions will ultimately dismantle his regime. However, if Kim sees weakness in our South Korean allies that he can use to chip- away at the current sanctions on his regime, he will continue to stall negotiations and our leverage will begin to collapse. President Moon must not be deceived by Kim’s small gestures of goodwill and prematurely fold. And that’s just the way it is.

HONORING STAFF SERGEANT PATRICIA SALAZAR

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, December 19, 2018 Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Staff Sergeant Patricia Salazar, who recently retired from the New Mexico Air National Guard after 25 years of distinguished service. Throughout her accomplished career, Staff Sergeant Salazar played many valuable roles in defense of our state and our nation.

scholarship from the College of Santa Fe and graduated in 1984 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Criminology. She went on to receive a Master of Science degree in Criminal Justice Administration from California State University, Long Beach in 1986. After completing her graduate degree, Staff Sergeant Salazar re-turned to her home state and attended New Mexico State Police Training Academy. She then enlisted in the United States Air Force and completed her training in 1993. Staff Sergeant Salazar began her tenure with the New Mexico Air National Guard’s 150th Security Forces Squadron at Kirtland Air Force Base in Albuquerque. After the tragic events of September 11th, 2001, she helped develop and initiate emergency evacuation plans for senior Pentagon leadership. In 2003, she transitioned to the New Mexico Army Na-tional Guard’s 1209th Medical Detachment. From 2009 to 2011, Staff Sergeant Salazar was stationed in Kosovo and supervised a team of field medics during deployment and field operations. In 2012, she returned to Kirtland to serve with the New Mexico Air Na-tional Guard’s 150th Special Operations Wing. I had the pleasure of meeting Staff Sergeant Salazar last year when I worked with the Army to ensure that her father, Staff Sergeant Joe Salazar, received the medals he earned while serving our nation in World War II. He served with the 497th Bombardment Group of the Army Air Forces from 1942 to 1945, earning several honors including a Bronze Star. Mr. Salazar was also a role model for his daughter when she enlisted and during her service overseas. Mr. Speaker, I want to salute Staff Sergeant Patricia Salazar for her 25 years of service to New Mexico and the United States. It is hard- working, service-minded individuals like her who continue to make our state and our nation so great. I wish her the best of luck in all her future endeavors.

RECOGNIZING WILLIAM GRAY 
HON. ERIC SWALWELL 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, December 19, 2018 Mr. SWALWELL of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Mr. William Gray on his re-tirement from Gray-Bowen-Scott, a company William founded and served as President of for over 30 years. Before founding Gray-Bowen-Scott, William served as the Chief Deputy Public Works Di-rector of Contra Costa County. He served as an active participant in supporting major civic efforts regarding transportation issues in the region. It should then come as no surprise that William is credited with spearheading several innovative and successful land development plans such as Pleasant Hill BART, the first transit-oriented development in the county. After his tenure as Chief Deputy Public Works Director of Contra Costa County, Wil-liam founded Gray-Bowen-Scott and through his leadership and vision championed many collaborative ventures that impacted economic vitality, improved movement of goods and people, and enhanced the quality of life for the East Bay. Though his accomplishments over more than 30 years are innumerable, there are a few achievements we should mention for the extraordinary impact they had on our com-munity. William was instrumental in the completion of the Interstate 680/Highway 24 Interchange. He helped facilitate the three-county partner-ship for the I–680 Sunol Grade Express Lane Project. And, he was a key figure in the fourth bore of the Caldecott Tunnel. William also had vision beyond singular projects and helped shape two specific pieces of legislation. These were Measure C, the original ‘‘self-help’’ transportation sales tax measure, which included the model for growth management policy and state congestion man-agement agencies, and Measure J, which en-sured continued progress for Contra Costa County of meeting the transportation infra-structure needs of the region. I want to thank William Gray for the signifi-cant contributions he has made to the Bay Area and wish him the best of luck in his re-tirement.
