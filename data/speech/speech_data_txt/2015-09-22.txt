CALLING FOR THE RELEASE OF 
UKRAINIAN FIGHTER PILOT NADIYA SAVCHENKO 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Foreign Affairs be discharged from further consideration of the resolution (H. Res. 50) calling for the release of Ukrainian fighter pilot Nadiya Savchenko, who was captured by Russian forces in Eastern Ukraine and has been held illegally in a Russian prison since July 2014, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House. 
The Clerk read the title of the resolu-
tion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. The text of the resolution is as fol-
lows: 
H. R ES. 50 
Whereas Nadiya Savchenko is the first- 
ever female fighter pilot in Ukraine’s Armed Forces and is an Iraqi war veteran; 
Whereas in the ongoing conflict in Eastern 
Ukraine, Nadiya Savchenko volunteered her services to the Ukrainian Aidar battalion; Whereas Nadiya Savchenko was elected in 
absentia from the Batkivshchyna Party to Ukraine’s Parliament in October 2014, and appointed to the Parliament Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) as a representa-tive from Ukraine; 
Whereas as a member of the Armed Forces 
of Ukraine, Lieutenant Nadiya Savchenko was conducting operations in eastern Ukraine against pro-Russian forces in the summer of 2014 when she was captured and taken into captivity; 
Whereas during her mission in Eastern 
Ukraine, she was captured by the Donbas People’s Militia, detained on Ukrainian ter-ritory, deprived of rights to due process, and illegally transferred to the Russian Federa-tion to stand trial on unsubstantiated charges of terrorism; 
Whereas since July 2014, Nadiya Savchenko 
has endured involuntary psychiatric evalua-tions and solitary confinement; 
Whereas Nadiya Savchenko is currently 
entering her sixth week of a hunger strike as a symbol of her protest; 
Whereas Nadiya Savchenko is denied ac-
cess to urgently needed medical attention and access to legal counsel; 
Whereas the Minsk Protocol of September 
2014, signed by Ukraine and the Russian Fed-eration, calls for the ‘‘immediate release of all hostages and illegally held persons’’; 
Whereas appeals have been made to the 
United Nations Human Rights Council and the International Red Cross to secure Nadiya Savchenko’s release; 
Whereas the international community in-
cluding representatives of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) and of the United States have urged her im-mediate release; 
Whereas, on January 26, 2015, the opening 
day of the Parliamentary Assembly, the global community embark on a public cam-paign to bring attention to the plight of Nadiya Savchenko and demand her imme-diate release; and 
Whereas the Government of the United 
States and its people express concern about the deteriorating health of detained pilot Nadiya Savchenko and her continued illegal imprisonment: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representa-
tives— 
(1) condemns the Russian Federation for 
its illegal imprisonment of Nadiya Savchenko;

(2) calls on the Russian Federation to im-
mediately release Nadiya Savchenko; 
(3) calls on the United States, its European 
allies, and the international community to aggressively support efforts to release Nadiya Savchenko and other illegally de-tained persons; and 
(4) expresses solidarity with the Ukrainian 
people. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, 
H. Res. 50, introduced by Representative L
EVIN, calls for the release of former Ukrainian 
fighter pilot Nadiya Savchenko, who has been languishing in Russian prisons since she was abducted by pro-Russian forces in eastern Ukraine in 2014, and illegally transferred across the border in handcuffs and with a bag over her head. 
Since she was incarcerated on specious 
and unsubstantiated charges, Nadiya has en-dured interrogations, involuntary psychiatric evaluations and solitary confinement. She spent four months on a hunger strike as a symbol of protest, ending it last April. Her trial opened today. 
Nadiya is yet another victim of the Putin re-
gime’s brutality. We must recognize that this isn’t just about her, but also represents a very visible manifestation of Russia’s aggression towards a Ukraine that wishes to remain free, independent, and democratic. Nadiya is a symbol for the struggle of Ukraine. 
Madam Speaker, Nadiya Savchenko was 
elected in absentia to the Ukrainian Parliament in October and was named a member of Ukraine’s delegation to the Parliamentary As-sembly of the Council of Europe. As such, she enjoys diplomatic immunity. 
With its illegal annexation of Crimea and the 
war in eastern Ukraine, Russia has made a mockery of its international commitments, in-cluding all ten core OSCE principles enshrined in the 1975 Helsinki Final Act. Nadiya’s illegal detention, along with that of other Ukrainian citizens held hostage by Moscow, represents yet another in a long list of violations of inter-national agreements and the norms of civilized behavior. 
According to the Minsk agreements between 
Russia along with its separatist proxies, and Ukraine, hostages are supposed to be re-leased. Moscow needs to immediately release Nadiya and the many other hostages, includ-ing Oleg Sentsov and Oleksander Kolchenko, who were recently sentenced in a Russian court on completely baseless charges. 
Madam Speaker, my amendment calls for 
the imposition of personal sanctions against individuals responsible for the kidnapping, ar-rest, and imprisonment of Nadiya Savchenko and other Ukrainian citizens illegally incarcer-ated in Russia. 
Mr. LEVIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
support of House Resolution 50, calling on the release of the detained Ukrainian pilot Nadiya Savchenko. 
The Ukrainian pilot Nadiya Savchenko was 
captured by Russia-controlled forces in July 2014 in eastern Ukraine; illegally transferred to Russia, and later charged with trumped up charges of murder. Since then, she has been kept in Russian custody. There can be little doubt that she is being held as a political pris-oner, punished for her defiance, and used as a bargaining tool in Russia’s protracted of-fense against Ukraine. 
Since her capture, Ms. Savchenko has 
come to represent the spirit of an independent Ukraine. A Ukraine that is free from inter-ference and eager to embrace the will of its 
own people, striving towards the rule of law and democracy. We all know that the last two years have been difficult. Since the start of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, eight thousand people have been killed, over a million people have been displaced, and Crimea has become occupied. All the while, meaningful progress seems elusive as reports of continued fighting make news week after week. 
Amidst all the reports of death and violence, 
Ms. Savchenko’s courage and spirit have in-spired millions of people around the world. Here at home, the Ukrainian-American com-munity in my home district has followed her case especially closely. Together, we worried for her health when she underwent a lengthy hunger strike earlier in the year. And we also worried for her well-being, as her case suf-fered repeated and unfair delays. We now call for her release. 
For those of us who have followed human 
rights issues, it is easy to see through the re-peated delays, the so-called psychiatric eval-uations, and the changes in venues to dis-courage outside observers. These tactics are used all too often as tools of intimidation and confusion by authoritarian regimes. 
Ms. Savchenko’s trial began earlier today, 
where journalists were barred from the court-room. I have no reason to believe that her trial will be fair, given the precedents set thus far. 
I call for her release, and urge my col-
leagues to rise in support of Ms. Savchenko, and in support of the Ukrainian people. Let us send a unified message in support of human rights around the world.

JERSEY

(5) calls upon the United States to impose

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The

The Clerk read as follows: 
Strike the preamble and insert the fol-
lowing:

Whereas in protest of her illegal detention,

Whereas the Minsk Protocol of September

Whereas on February 12, 2015, the United 
States Senate passed S. Res. 52 by unani-mous consent, a Resolution calling for Savchenko’s release; 
Whereas on April 22, 2015, the Verkhovna 
Rada of Ukraine voted unanimously to pass a resolution ‘‘On the imposing of sanctions on persons responsible for the illegal impris-onment in the Russian Federation of Nadiya Savchenko’’, which included the names of 35 individuals believed to be responsible for Nadiya Savchenko’s illegal imprisonment; and 
Whereas the Government of the United 
States and its people express concern about the continued illegal imprisonment of Nadiya Savchenko: Now, therefore, be it

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. Eternal Lord God, our hope for years 
to come, as we approach Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish year, in-spire us to strive to live Godly lives. 
Lord, remind our lawmakers that 
You call each of us to flee from impu-rity and to live with integrity. Teach our Senators to accentuate the posi-tive, to think thoughts that are pure, commendable, just, and honorable. May they permit You to cleanse them from every defilement, empowering them to live for You as they seek to do Your will. 
Lord, create in us all clean hearts 
and renew a right spirit within us. 
We pray in Your merciful Name. 
Amen.

PAIN-CAPABLE UNBORN CHILD 
PROTECTION BILL 
Mr. M CCONNELL. Mr. President, ask 
a family to show you the first picture of their child these days, and you are likely to get a black-and-white image with delicate fingers and tiny toes. Maybe it is their precious Christine. 
Maybe it is their little guy Brett. But one thing’s for sure—that baby is their child. 
Scientific advances like the 
sonogram are helping pull back the curtain on the mystery of life, they are helping foster a new spirit of compas-sionate protection for the most de-fenseless, and they are providing new opportunities to bridge old political di-vides. 
We in this Chamber are never going 
to agree completely on the abortion question, but we should at least be able to agree that if an unborn child has reached the point where he or she can feel pain, that child’s life deserves pro-tection. Science is telling us that a child can reach this stage around 20 weeks—in other words, 5 months. This is when unborn children can react— even recoil—to stimuli an adult would recognize as painful. This is when doc-tors even administer fetal anesthesia during surgery. 
As the New England Journal of Medi-
cine study recently demonstrated, ba-bies delivered at this age can survive outside the womb. So even if we differ on the larger abortion issue, can’t we at least agree that children at this late stage of development deserve our pro-tection? The American people seem to think so. Polls show that American women and American men oppose abor-tions after 5 months. The fact is that we are now one of just seven nations— among them countries such as North Korea and China—that allow elective abortions at such a late stage. Can’t we do better than this as a country? The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act would allow America to finally join the ranks of the most civilized na-tions on this issue. 
Just this past weekend in Louisville, 
hundreds of Kentuckians gathered to spread a message of dignity and hope. They marched for those who may not meet them. They marched for those who may not hear them. But I hope Americans across the country, includ-
ing participants in the 37th annual Walk for Life, will be encouraged to know that their voices of humanity and of respect are finally being heard again in a Senate under new leader-ship. 
The executive director of Kentucky 
Right to Life said the issue before us is ‘‘critical.’’ She said, ‘‘We have worked tirelessly to give these defenseless ba-bies some protection.’’ Several States have already taken action to protect these children. So has the House of Representatives. Now it is up to each of us to show where we stand. We are seeing how science is changing this de-bate. 
So what I am asking every colleague 
is this: Look in your hearts and help us stand up for the most innocent life, help us protect that beating heart in that sonogram.

MEASURES PLACED ON THE

States Code, to prohibit a health care practi-tioner from failing to exercise the proper de-gree of care in the case of a child who sur-vives an abortion or attempted abortion. 
Mr. M CCONNELL. Mr. President, in

tion having been heard, the bills will be placed on the calendar.

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
Democratic leader is recognized. 
WOMEN’S HEALTH 
Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is said 
you cannot make the same mistake twice because the second time it is a choice, it is not a mistake. I repeat: It is said you cannot make the same mis-take twice because the second time you make it, it is a choice. On every issue, Republicans are choosing to employ the same failed strategy they have tried time and time again. They are making choices. Over and over again, they drag Congress and the American people through votes that are nothing more than publicity stunts, solely de-signed to boost their conservative records. 
Today we stand in the midst of yet 
another show vote designed to honor the political wish lists of extremists. Once again, Republicans have decided to place a woman’s health at the center of their ideological campaign. We have seen this tactic before. It does not work. 
Americans are tired of the Repub-
lican attacks on the health of women. Earlier this year, Republicans manipu-lated a bill. The bill was to help vic-tims of human trafficking. They turned it into a political football by attaching ideological abortion riders. They have tried to repeatedly cut off funds for Planned Parenthood, a critical safety net provider for women. 
Now today, in the face of a govern-
ment shutdown, they decide to waste the Senate’s time on a 20-week abor-tion ban. Every Senator in this body knows this bill is going nowhere. This attack is a waste of time. The bill on its merits is no good. It will accom-plish nothing. By holding today’s vote, the Republican leader is pandering to the rightwing extremists in his party who are willing to take our govern-ment hostage, trying to score nothing more than political points. 
The time for partisan politics is over. 
The Senate, our government, cannot afford to be subjected to meaningless attacks on the health of women. We will be in session for only 2 more days this week. The House will not convene today or tomorrow. On October 1 the government will run out of money. With or without the stamp of approval Republicans are so desperately seeking, on October 1 the government will be out of money. 
Republicans should end their par-
tisan attack on women and join Demo-crats in carrying out one of our pri-
mary responsibilities as elected offi-cials, as Members of Congress, and that is to keep the government doors open. Actions speak louder than words. These partisan attacks on the health of women, led by Republicans and the leader specifically today, will not only push Congress to the brink of another government shutdown—we are there. It would show once again that Repub-licans would rather attack women’s health than keep their obligation to the American people. 
On Thursday we are going to be in a 
very difficult time squeeze. We are going to have another vote, abortion related, on Planned Parenthood, and then we are going to have to try to fig-ure out a way to fund the government. This responsibility is on the Repub-licans. They control the House and the Senate. It is not our responsibility. We will help in any way we can. We have not held up anything procedurally. We do not intend to do that. We want to move forward and get the government funded. But we are at a crossroads here. I am not sure we can make it with the time set because of all of these unnecessary votes that have been scheduled by the Republican leader these last couple of weeks. I hope we can make it and not have to see the government shut down again. But, you know, we have seen that before. The American people have been to that rodeo before. Who has suffered? The American people. 
I would hope the Republican leader 
has a plan to help us get out of this morass they have created. We will do everything we can within reason to make sure the American people are treated fairly in the upcoming spend-ing bills, but we have to get there by October 1. 
Will the Chair announce the business 
of the day.

RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the leadership time is reserved. 
f 
PAIN-CAPABLE UNBORN CHILD 
PROTECTION ACT—MOTION TO PROCEED 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the Senate will re-sume consideration of the motion to proceed to H.R. 36, which the clerk will report. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 230, 
H.R. 36, a bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to protect pain-capable unborn children, and for other purposes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the time until 11 a.m. will be equally divided between the leaders or their designees. 
The assistant Democratic leader. Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would 
like to address the issue before the Senate. It relates to the divisive and 
controversial issue of abortion. It comes at an unusual moment in the history of the Congress. 
This week, for the first time, the 
Pope will be addressing a joint session of Congress. It was 50 years ago when the first Pope visited the United States. The arrival of Pope Francis this week is a cause of great celebra-tion to people from my State of Illinois and across this Nation because of their respect for his leadership of the Catho-lic Church. It calls to question, of course, the relationship between reli-gion and our government. 
This summer I finished a book called 
‘‘Mayflower,’’ which told the story of the Pilgrims coming to the United States, settling in in our country, looking for a new opportunity but looking more than anything for free-dom of religious belief. They were fol-lowed by scores and thousands of oth-ers who came for the same reason. 
My mother was an immigrant to this 
country, brought here at the age of 2. Her mother brought her and her sister and brother to our shores for a variety of reasons. But there is one thing that sticks out in that journey. Up in my of-fice I have something that my grand-mother carried across the ocean from Lithuania to the United States. It was a Roman Catholic prayer book written in Lithuanian. It was contraband in 1911 in Lithuania for her to possess it because the Russians were in control and the Russians were imposing the or-thodox religion and making it difficult to practice the Catholic religion. I never knew my grandmother, but she was one brave lady to bring three kids across the ocean and stick in her bag that prayer book which meant so much to her, that prayer book which she could use in the United States of Amer-ica without the government telling her she could not. 
We have tried to strike the right bal-
ance between religion and our democ-racy from the beginning. I believe our Founding Fathers got it right. They said three things in the Constitution about religion: first, that each of us would have the freedom to worship as we choose or to choose not to worship; second, that the government would not choose a religion and that we would not have an official government reli-gion; and third, that there would be no religious test for public office in Amer-ica. 
I thought those were settled prin-
ciples, but this Presidential campaign suggests otherwise. We had the out-rageous suggestion by a Republican Presidential candidate this last week-end that a Muslim should never serve as President of the United States. I would think that a man of his back-ground and learning would at least take the time to understand our Con-stitution and the express provision which says that he is wrong, that there will never by a religious litmus test to serve in public office in the United States.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6861 September 22, 2015 
And now, this week on the floor of 
the Senate, we will have two votes on the issue of abortion. There was a time when this issue came before us fre-quently—not so much lately. It is a di-visive and controversial issue; that is for sure. But this week the Republican Senate leadership has allowed two of their Presidential candidates to raise this issue on the floor of the Senate. It is no coincidence this issue comes be-fore us the same week the Pope, the leader of the Catholic Church, will be addressing a joint session of Congress. It is more than a coincidence. 
This particular bill relates to when a 
person can terminate a pregnancy. For 47 years, if I am not mistaken—maybe I have that calculation slightly wrong—we have had Supreme Court guidance on when the government can play a role in the decision about the termination of a pregnancy. Now there is an effort on the floor of the Senate to change that basic guidance from the Roe v. Wade decision. Each time we step into this question, into something which seems as clear as ‘‘at 20 weeks we will draw a line and after that there cannot be a legal termination of preg-nancy,’’ we find we are walking into an area of uncertainty. 
I remember meeting many years ago, 
when we were debating this issue, a woman from Illinois. She was from the town of Naperville. In 1996 she told me a harrowing story of how legislation such as the bill before us would have impacted her. She learned late in her pregnancy that the child she was car-rying could not survive outside the womb. Her doctors diagnosed her baby with at least nine major anomalies, in-cluding a fluid-filled cranium with no brain tissue. Sadly, she also had under-lying medical conditions—personal conditions—that complicated her preg-nancy even more. Doctors were con-cerned that if she went through with the pregnancy at that point, she ran the risk of never having another baby. With tears in her eyes, she told me how she and her husband agonized over the news and eventually decided it was best for them and their other children to terminate that pregnancy. 
If the bill before us today—the 20- 
week abortion bill—had been the law of the land back then, sadly it would have jeopardized and endangered her health. 
Well, 18 years later she came back to 
see me. I learned she was able to do what was best for her family in termi-nating that pregnancy. That was her decision with her doctor and her hus-band. But she was given a second chance. Soon after, she became preg-nant again. This time she was thankful to give birth to a healthy baby boy. When she came to see me, she told me about her son Nick. She said he had be-come a star football player and had a bright future ahead of him. 
If this bill had been the law of the 
land, this woman in Illinois—and oth-ers like her—would not even have had the choice to terminate a pregnancy for her own health protection and for the opportunity to have another baby. 
That is the challenge we face when we try to spell out in law all of the med-ical possibilities, limiting opportuni-ties and decisions to be made by indi-viduals under the most heartbreaking circumstances. 
This bill has other issues. The fact 
that the rape and incest exceptions, which have largely been built into the law to this point, would be changed dramatically by this law raises ques-tions as well. There is a requirement, as I understand it, in this law that vic-tims of incest would have had to report to a law enforcement agency that crime of incest before they would even be able to terminate a pregnancy under these circumstances. That is not even realistic—to think some young child in a household, who has been exploited by another member of the family, would think to go to a law enforcement agen-cy and report that other member of her family before they could qualify to ter-minate a pregnancy in this cir-cumstance. 
That shows the extremes this bill 
goes to. I hope we will defeat this measure. I sincerely hope the other Re-publican Presidential candidate, who is going to try to shut down the govern-ment over the funding of Planned Par-enthood later in the week, does not prevail either. We need to move on to find other issues—not divisive issues but issues we can build a bipartisan consensus on to make this a stronger country. 
We need to address the issue of fund-
ing our government and to accept the responsibilities to move forward in a bipartisan fashion. This bill does not do that. 
I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, be-
fore we vote on whether to proceed to H.R. 36, I want to respond to a couple of arguments made by a Democratic Senator yesterday. 
First, that Democratic Senator 
quoted Hal Lawrence of the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gyne-cologists for the proposition that a 20- week fetus is not viable. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gyne-cologists, the group Dr. Lawrence rep-resents, has long opposed this legisla-tion. 
According to the Senator I am con-
fronting on this issue, Dr. Lawrence said the following on May 13, 2015: 
In no way, shape or form is a 20-week fetus 
viable. There is no evidence anywhere of a 20-week fetus surviving, even with intensive medical care. 
But as explained by the Washington 
Post Fact Checker of May 26 of this year, Dr. Lawrence’s statement is sim-ply incorrect when applied to H.R. 36. The bill uses a method of calculating fetal age that is based on the day that fertilization actually occurred. The legislation would protect the unborn beginning at 20 weeks after fertiliza-tion, which is the same as 22 weeks of pregnancy, also known as 22-week ges-
tational age. Gestational age is a meas-ure of calculating the unborn baby’s age that relies on the date of the moth-er’s last normal menstrual period. 
It is well established that babies can 
survive at 22-week gestational age. As noted in the Washington Post, for ex-ample: ‘‘That babies can survive at 22 weeks gestational age has been known for 15 years.’’ 
Perhaps Dr. Lawrence was confused 
about what H.R. 36 would accomplish. The Washington Post Fact Checker ar-ticle sets the record straight. 
Second, the Senator I am referring to 
said earlier that abortions past 20-week fetal age are extraordinarily rare. Some jurisdictions with the most lax abortion policies don’t even collect data on the stage of pregnancy when an abortion is performed, while other ju-risdictions may have reporting require-ments but are not really enforcing those reporting requirements. Because data on late-term abortions is not widely available, it is hard to know what hard evidence really exists to support the claim. We do know that several hundred doctors, and well over 200 facilities across the United States, offer abortions after 20 weeks of fetal age. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent to have printed in the R
ECORD the 
Washington Post article I earlier re-ferred to. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the R
ECORD , as follows:

SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT ON MEAS-
URING FETAL AGE AND THE ‘20-W EEKABOR-
TION’ 
(By Michelle Ye Hee Lee) 
‘‘In no way, shape or form is a 20-week 
fetus viable. There’s no evidence of a 20-week fetus surviving, even with intensive medical care.’’—American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Executive Vice President Hal Lawrence, quoted in a news article, May 13, 2015 
Several readers requested The Fact Check-
er to examine claims related to the Pain Ca-pable Unborn Child Protection Act, recently passed by the House. This bill is commonly referred to as the ‘‘20-week abortion ban.’’ 
The abortion debate is fraught with rhet-
oric that cannot be easily fact-checked. But a reader pointed us to the quote above and asked whether a new study on the viability of 22-week fetuses can be applied to 20-week fetuses, when using a different method to count gestational age. To add to the confu-sion, states vary in their definitions for ges-tational age. The quote above is one example of several instances in recent media coverage that related to definitions of gestational age. 
This is a technical, but important, part of 
the bill. The little-known difference between two methods of counting gestational age is contributing to inconsistent media coverage, and could mislead the public, parents and providers about the bill’s provisions. 
So what exactly is going on? 
THE FACTS  
The Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection 
Act bans late-term abortions after the mid-point of a woman’s pregnancy, and before the fetus typically is considered viable to live outside of the womb. The age of viability has 
VerDate Sep 11 2014 03:16 Sep 23, 2015 Jkt 049060 PO 00000 Frm 00003 Fmt 0624 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G22SE6.005 S22SEPT1emcdonald on DSK67QTVN1PROD with SENATE
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6862 September 22, 2015 
been pegged at 24 to 28 weeks. Proponents 
argue an abortion ban at younger than 24 weeks, saying fetuses can feel pain before then—a claim based in complex science and disputed by the Royal College of Obstetri-cians and Gynaecologists. (Supporters point to various studies related to fetal develop-ment, compiled here.) 
A new study published in the New England 
Journal of Medicine on May 7 examined how hospitals differ in whether and how they treat extremely premature babies, starting at 22 weeks. Proponents of the bill say this study, funded by the National Institutes of Health, shows that the babies who would be saved through the 20-week abortion ban could now be considered viable. Some media reports also echoed the same conclusions. 
Sound confusing? The distinction is this: 
The bill defines the age of the fetus as ‘‘post- fertilization age,’’ calculated from the mo-ment of conception. This is different from the widely-accepted definition used by med-ical professionals and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, counting the fetus age from the first day of the pregnant wom-an’s last menstrual period (‘‘LMP’’). 
Fertilization typically happens about two 
weeks after the first day of LMP. The idea is that it is difficult to know exactly when you became pregnant, but you know when you started your last period. That is why the bill’s supporters say the 20-week age meas-ured from fertilization essentially is the LMP-measured age of 22 weeks. 
The bill’s definition is a more technical 
and accurate measure, said Michael Woeste, House Judiciary Committee spokesman. He noted an excerpt in The Developing Human: Clinically Oriented Embryology, arguing that the LMP method is error prone partly because ‘‘it depends on the mother’s memory of an event that occurred several weeks be-fore she realized she was pregnant’’ and that ‘‘the day fertilization occurs is the most ac-curate reference point for estimating age.’’ 
Lawrence’s quote at the top of this fact 
check comes from a statement during a re-cent media call. (The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, or ACOG, opposed the bill.) He was referring to the 20- week LMP age, not the 20-week post-fer-tilization age. 
The rest of his statement during the call 
explains his point further and how it ties in with the legislation (and also wrote an op-ed about it in Time): 
‘‘Now, I’d like to talk a bit about why sup-
porters of a 20-week abortion ban are, quite simply, wrong. There is no medical mile-stone associated with 20 weeks. Gestation is a gradual process, and it can vary depending on the circumstances, such as the woman’s health. 
‘‘But still, even accounting for this, the 20- 
week mark is just not notable from a fetal development standpoint. More than 40 years ago, the Supreme Court stipulated that abor-tion is legal until a fetus is viable. Well, in no way, shape or form is a 20-week fetus via-ble. There is no evidence anywhere of a 20- week fetus surviving, even with intensive medical care. 
‘‘Unfortunately, some advocates of abor-
tion bans are pointing to a new study, just published last week, that they claim heralds 22 weeks as being the new point of viability. They suggest that we might someday reach viability at 20 weeks. It is essential that we address that now, before this becomes an-other myth about abortion that is accepted as reality.’’ 
We spoke with the main authors of the 
study, Matthew Rysavy and Dr. Edward Bell of University of Iowa. They collected data for nearly 5,000 infants born between 22 and 27 weeks of gestation (using LMP method) and did not have abnormalities at birth. These babies are extremely pre-term, as full 
term is considered at 39 to 40 weeks, accord-ing to ACOG guidelines. 
Researchers found that 22 percent of the 
babies born at 22 weeks received active treat-ment, and hospitals varied in their whether and how they gave treatment to babies born between 22 and 27 weeks. There were 78 ba-bies born at 22 weeks who received aggres-sive treatment. Among them, 18 of them sur-vived (23 percent) to toddler age. Seven (9 percent) of them did not have severe or mod-erate impairment by the time they were tod-dlers. 
That babies can survive at 22 weeks is not 
a new finding; it has been known for 15 years, Rysavy said. The point of the study was to highlight differences in practices and out-comes between hospitals, he said. Many fac-tors, including gestational age, influence how well a baby does: ‘‘Our paper wasn’t ex-actly intended for identifying which infants would do well.’’ 
The Fact Checker asked if, using the 
‘‘post-fertilization’’ age definition in the bill, their findings can carry over to babies at 20 weeks old from the point of conception. Bell and Rysavy said that would be ‘‘terribly con-fusing’’ to the public, pregnant women and even to politicians. Bell said the LMP meth-od is used around the world, and that the time of conception accurately cannot be ascertained. 
‘‘You cannot redefine gestational age based 
on conception. . . . The new terms are politi-cian terms. They have no relevance at all to medicine or biology. They’re just going to confuse everybody,’’ Bell said. ‘‘They have the right to do that for the purpose of mak-ing laws, but to me, it just looks like an at-tempt to obfuscate and create confusion. We already have a well-established definition of the length of pregnancy that has worked just fine, for generations, has been used forever.’’ 
Rysavy also sent us this diagram, of the 
American Academy of Pediatrics’ termi-nology for age during the perinatal period: 
ACOG recommends using LMP and updat-
ing the due date with other measures, such as ultrasounds, since women may have irreg-ular cycles and there is variability in how long a fertilized egg becomes implanted in the uterus (thus beginning pregnancy). Law-rence, in a statement, said: ‘‘The fact that federal legislation is basing restrictions on reproductive care based on a non-medical calculation of pregnancy is evidence of what happens when lawmakers try to legislate women’s health.’’ 
THE BOTTOM LINE  
New research confirmed that 22-week 
fetuses, measured from the first day of the pregnant woman’s last menstrual cycle, can survive. Babies born before that age did not survive. So, Lawrence is correct that 20-week fetuses, measured from the first day of the pregnant woman’s last menstrual cycle, are not viable. He is incorrect when using the definition in the Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. 
The Fact Checker takes no stance on 
which definition should be used. However, we want to set the record straight for the public and the media. This is a technical point over how gestational age is calculated. But it is important, as it has contributed to some misleading headlines, lack of context in news coverage and general confusion in the public debate. It also has contributed to the rhetoric on both sides; the difference be-tween the two definitions has not been clear in much of the news reporting. 
In many way, the debate is similar to how 
budget figures can vary dramatically de-pending on the baseline that is used. Report-ers need to specify exactly what method of measuring the pregnancy is being used, as the difference is not trivial. Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maine. 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am 
opposed to late-term abortions and would support legislation to ban them except in unusual circumstances. A carefully drawn, short list of excep-tions to apply in those rare cases should have been included in this bill. Regrettably, the bill before us provides no exception for when the physical health of the mother is at risk of seri-ous harm, the most glaring deficiency in this legislation. 
Let me give just three examples of 
devastating conditions that could threaten the physical health of a preg-nant woman. An extremely serious condition triggered by pregnancy in some women is preeclampsia, which tends to develop after the 20th week of pregnancy. This condition can lead to serious, long-term health consequences for a woman, including liver and kid-ney problems, vision disturbances, sei-zures and strokes. 
Another example would be a woman 
diagnosed with cancer who requires chemotherapy and radiation but can-not be treated while pregnant. A mas-sive infection, such as severe sepsis, is yet another case of a grave illness that could cause grievous harm for a preg-nant woman and to her physical health. 
Almost every country in Europe that 
limits late-term abortions allows for exceptions for the physical health of the mother. Like these European coun-tries, States such as Alabama, Arkan-sas, Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi, and others that ban late-term abor-tions provide an exception for the health as well as the life of the woman. But the bill before us does not. 
I have advocated that we add lan-
guage that would provide an exception when the woman is at serious risk of grievous injury to her physical health. This is an appropriately high standard to meet, but one that would allow a woman to terminate her pregnancy when the alternative is serious harm to her physical health. 
Under this bill, a doctor who per-
forms such an abortion after 20 weeks to prevent grievous physical injury to the pregnant woman would be subject to criminal penalties of up to 5 years in prison. 
Do we really want to make a crimi-
nal out of a physician who is trying to prevent a woman with preeclampsia from suffering damage to her kidneys or liver or having a stroke or seizures? Do we want the threat of prison for a doctor who knows that his pregnant patient needs chemotherapy or radi-ation treatments? If a woman has the terrible misfortune to have a serious infection of amniotic fluid that threat-ens her physical health and her ability to have children in the future, do we want her doctor to be unable to per-form an abortion because he faces the prospect of years in prison if he termi-nates her pregnancy?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6863 September 22, 2015 
The way the rape and incest excep-
tions to this bill are drafted is also problematic. I do not question the good motives of the sponsors of this bill, as I share their goal of prohibiting late- term abortions. My point, however, is that all of these language problems could be solved, and then we might well be able to enact a law that would accomplish the goal of ending late- term abortions except in those unusual cases where an exception is warranted. Therefore, I shall cast my vote in oppo-sition to this well-meaning but flawed bill. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from South Carolina. 
Mr. SCOTT. Mr. President, I am a 
proud pro-life Senator, and I stand on the floor of the Senate today with a gnawing feeling in the pit of my stom-ach. It is a feeling that comes with the knowledge that over the past 40 years more than 50 million Americans have not had the chance to have their feet touch the soil of our country. That is why I am thankful for the opportunity we have this week here in the Senate— an opportunity to celebrate life and to protect life, God’s most amazing gift of all. 
I am proud to have joined my col-
league and senior Senator from my State, L
INDSEY GRAHAM , in introducing 
this version of the pain-capable legisla-tion in the Senate. 
The studies are very, very clear that 
this legislation can save more than 18,000 lives each and every year. That is right, 18,000 lives each and every year. We aren’t talking about anything other than the results of sound science. And because of that sound science, we know that at approximately 5 months babies can feel pain. We know that if a baby were to need prenatal surgery at that age, they would be given anesthesia. Why? Because that little life—that lit-tle life—feels pain. 
Yesterday, Senator B
LUNT gave name 
after name after name of babies born around 5 months who have gone on to live healthy and full lives. This is not about pro-choice or pro-life. It is sim-ply about protecting ten fingers, ten toes, and one beating heart, and bring-ing the amazing gift of life. 
In our world, out of nearly 200 na-
tions, only seven allow abortions on de-mand after 20 weeks—only seven out of 200 nations. Who is among the seven nations? China, North Korea, Vietnam, and the United States. Really? 
So while I may stand here today with 
a gnawing in my stomach, I also stand with hope—hope that we can take a 
massive step forward in protecting life—18,000 lives a year—by passing this important legislation. 
America is truly a great nation. So 
let’s improve our reputation and not lower our expectations because, as John Winthrop said nearly 400 years ago, ‘‘We shall be as a city upon a hill, the eyes of all people are upon us.’’ 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that all time spent in a quorum call before the 11 a.m. vote be equally charged to each side. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. SCOTT. Mr. President, I suggest 
the absence of a quorum. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we are 
about a week away from the deadline to keep the Federal Government open. Our National Highway System, which at one time was a matter of great pride, will soon run out of money. The nominations of 16 consensus judicial nominees that came out of committee with bipartisan support are lan-guishing on the Senate floor. We’re not allowed to have a vote on the Senate floor about them even though, in many cases, they are courts with judicial emergencies. There is still strong sup-port in the Senate for passing meaning-ful immigration reform as we did 2 years ago by a 2-to-1 margin, Repub-licans and Democrats. Now, those are just a few of the pressing issues that the Senate should have been working on this month. Instead, the Senate Re-publican leadership has wasted 2 weeks on political show votes. And with a government shutdown looming, Senate Republicans plan to use this week to continue their relentless attack on women’s health care. 
Republicans brought us to this brink 
just 2 years ago, and, once again, they are trying to use Americans’ access to health care as leverage in a fight over funding the Federal Government. This time, though, Republicans also seem intent on holding hostage the constitu-tional rights of women as part of this political exercise. Frankly, what I hear when I go home is the American peo-ple, including women across this coun-try, have had enough. 
It is incredible to me that, in 2015, we 
are debating Federal funding for one of the Nation’s largest and most trusted providers of basic health care. For nearly 100 years, Planned Parenthood has provided women’s health care and has enjoyed the leadership and support of great Americans like the civil rights leader, Rosa Parks, who was a member of the organization’s board of advo-cates. 
Over 90 percent of the services 
Planned Parenthood provides are pre-ventative, including annual health exams, cervical and breast cancer screenings, and HIV screenings for mil-lions of American women, men, and young people. It is these preventive services and only these preventive services that are paid for with Federal funds. 
Republicans are focused on abortion 
services that are not paid for with Fed-eral dollars and are otherwise only a very small part of what Planned Par-enthood does. Republicans say it is be-cause of recently released videos that 
purport to show wrongdoing on the part of Planned Parenthood. But these surreptitiously recorded videos were heavily edited in a misleading way and generated by an organization formed with an agenda to end safe and legal abortion in our country. 
In reality, this partisan debate is 
nothing more than an opportunity for Senate Republicans to wage their per-sonal opposition to a woman’s decision to access safe and legal abortions in this country. They are entitled to their own beliefs. But missing from these ar-guments are the stories of women across this country whose health and lives are at stake when politicians play doctor and tell women they cannot make their own health care decisions. That is exactly the situation we face with the bill the Senate will vote on today, which puts women’s health at risk by imposing a nationwide ban on abortions at 20 weeks or more and criminalizing the doctors who care for 
them. 
The bill before us is as unconstitu-
tional as it is extreme. Federal courts have repeatedly struck down similar State 20-week bans as unconstitu-tional. Just last year, the U.S. Su-preme Court refused to review a Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals decision per-manently blocking Arizona’s 20-week- ban law. And this bill makes no excep-tion where the health of the woman is at risk. The exceptions it does include are severely limited. It is only if a woman’s health has deteriorated to the point at which she might die is she al-lowed to have an abortion under the bill’s exception for a woman’s life. 
The bill’s so-called rape exception is, 
in reality, an overwhelming bureauc-racy requiring survivors to jump through hoop after hoop, such as filing police reports or going to mandatory counseling. We should not be forcing these survivors to relive their trauma again and again before they can access abortion services. How many incest victims do you think are going to be able to do that, going through all these bureaucratic hoops? Doctors providing safe abortion care who fail to comply with all of the bill’s requirements would face up to 5 years of jail time. 
Now, it has all these dangerous provi-
sions, but you know what is even more shocking? This bill has had no com-mittee process in the Senate. There have been no Senate hearings on this bill, not one single Republican chair-man of any committee in the Senate has held a hearing. There has been no debate in the Judiciary Committee. We’ve not had a chance to hear from women and doctors about the care this bill would criminalize. I know last Con-gress, the current majority leader, who is a friend of mine, repeatedly urged the Senate to follow ‘‘regular order’’ on all legislation. On this bill, there was no regular order. It was brought straight to the floor. This is not a po-litical point; it is about what process in this body represents. It gives Sen-ators the opportunity to grapple with

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6864 September 22, 2015 
the real impact of legislation like this. 
That is what was lost here. 
In Vermont, I witnessed the dev-
astating effect of restricting women’s access to safe and legal abortion. I say this, Mr. President, because I am the only Member of the U.S. Senate who has ever prosecuted somebody in an abortion case. When I was a young prosecutor in Vermont, I was called to a hospital to see a young woman who nearly died from hemorrhaging caused by a botched abortion. She was unable to obtain a safe abortion in my state because it was illegal. I prosecuted the man who had arranged for her unsafe and illegal abortion that nearly killed her. 
Don’t talk about hypotheticals. I saw 
the tragic impact that the lack of safe legal abortion care had on women and families in my state, and so I talked to doctors about challenging Vermont’s law. In that case, Beecham v. Leahy, the conservative Vermont Supreme Court called out the hypocrisy of a statute whose stated purpose was to protect women’s health, rightly ask-ing, ‘‘Where is that concern for the health of the pregnant woman when she is denied the advice and assistance of her doctor?’’ One year before Roe v. Wade, the Vermont Supreme Court, all members of it were Republicans, ruled that protecting women’s health re-quired access to safe and legal abortion services, ensuring that women in our state would no longer be subjected to back alley abortions. We should not forget that this history was once re-ality for so many women in our Nation. That is why I supported our Vermont Supreme Court’s decision that we should not deny women’s health by de-nying access to safe and legal abortion services. 
As we consider the bill before us 
today, we should also remember what Beecham v. Leahy and, a year later, when Roe made clear which should be crystal clear for all of us here today in 2015, abortion is an extremely difficult and personal choice. And if we truly want to reduce abortions—as I do, and I suspect most of us do, maybe all of us do—we should be making sure that family planning services are univer-sally available. We should support or-ganizations like Planned Parenthood that can provide family planning serv-ices, especially in rural areas and else-where where they might not be avail-able, because that, in itself, will lower the number of abortions. 
I oppose the bill pending before us. I 
hope that Senators on both sides of the aisle will do the same. And this Senate, which I love, ought to turn away from show votes and start leading respon-sibly so that we can avoid yet another government shutdown with billions upon billions of dollars that would be wasted. 
Now, some want a shutdown because 
they think it might help their cam-paigns or their press availability. None of them are going to tell the press when they have that shutdown how many billions of dollars of taxpayers’ 
money they waste by doing it. So let us remember again, the Vermont Supreme Court, at that time a very conservative Supreme Court, in the case of Beecham v. Leahy, when they called out the hy-pocrisy of a statute whose stated pur-pose was to protect women’s health, said, ‘‘Where is that concern for the health of the pregnant woman when she’s denied the advice and assistance of her doctor?’’ 
Let’s stop the show voting; let’s stop 
playing for whatever group we want to raise money from for a campaign or for the Presidency by forcing a shutdown. And let’s think about the taxpayers of this country which are going to try to force a shutdown, then let’s put a dol-lar figure on it and say how much the grandstanding cost. It will cost into the billions and billions of dollars and makes this great nation look foolish around the world.

VOTE EXPLANATION  
∑Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, today 
the Senate voted on the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, H.R. 36. While I was unable to vote today, I would have opposed this bill, which would have amended the Criminal Code to prohibit any person from performing an abortion after 20 weeks. As the fa-ther of three daughters, I believe that a woman’s health, not politicians in Washington, should drive important medical decisions. It is critical that we as a nation continue to have a mean-ingful and respectful dialogue about an issue we all care about deeply, and I do not believe that this bill would have advanced that dialogue. ∑

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6865 September 22, 2015 
The motion was agreed to. 
Mr. M CCONNELL. I ask unanimous 
consent that the time until 12 noon be equally divided prior to the cloture vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, al-
most exactly a year ago, President Obama addressed the Nation and de-clared his resolve to degrade and de-stroy ISIL. I will speak more on that in just a moment, but there are two lines in that speech of particular relevance to the vote we are about to take. 
This is what President Obama had to 
say: 
As Commander-in-Chief, my highest pri-
ority is the security of the American people [and] our own safety, our own security, de-pends upon our willingness to do what it takes to defend this nation and uphold the values that we stand for. 
He was certainly right. It does. And 
doing what it takes requires many things—everything from amphibious shipping, Joint Strike Fighters, and forward presence, to preserving our gains in Afghanistan and investing in the naval systems required to balance against Chinese expansion in Asia. 
So when President Obama sent us a 
budget request asking for $612 billion in defense spending, we worked across the aisle to craft a bipartisan appro-priations bill at that level. Democrats hailed the defense spending as a win- win and a victory for their States. They voted to pass it out of the Appro-priations Committee. This is how the Defense appropriations bill came out of the Appropriations Committee: 27 to 3. 
But then, as the Washington Post put 
it, Democrats ‘‘decided to block all spending bills starting with the defense appropriations measure’’ as part of some ‘‘filibuster summer’’ strategy de-signed to pump more taxpayer cash into Washington bureaucracies such as the IRS. The same President who had lectured the Nation about doing ‘‘what it takes to defend this nation’’ seemed content to have our military held hos-tage to the whims of the far left. The White House cheered as they voted re-peatedly to block the bill that funds pay raises and medical care for our troops. It was outrageous then, and it is outrageous now. 
China is deploying ships to the Ber-
ing Sea and to the coast of Alaska. Russia’s military is positioning itself in Syria to attack anti-regime forces under the guise of a counterterrorism campaign. Refugees are pouring forth in the thousands, causing instability in Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, and Europe. And 1 year after the President’s speech, ISIL is consolidating its gains within Syria and Iraq as it demonstrates an agility and an operational flexibility that threaten our country and our na-tional security interests. 
The sad lesson of the last 7 years is 
that our global conventional drawdown and withdrawal from the Middle East emboldened Russia and China. Our am-bitious train-and-equip and economy- 
of-force programs to train combat forces within Yemen, Afghanistan, and Iraq and our program to train an oppo-sition to fight within Syria—all have failed to defeat the enemy. And Iran now appears free under the President’s deal to inspect its own suspected nu-clear site and to funnel more cash to Hezbollah. 
If President Obama is committed to 
protecting the American people, he will convince his party to end its blockade of funding our military. We are going to give our Democratic friends that chance again in a few mo-ments. 
The goal of Democrats’ ‘‘filibuster 
summer’’ was to force Congress back to the brink. They have succeeded in doing that. They think it is the only way to force America to accept their demands for more debt and more bu-reaucracy. But it is time Democrats started considering the needs of our country, not the wants of the far left or the IRS. Ending their blockade of fund-ing for our military at a time of sig-nificant international threats would show they are ready to start putting Americans first. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
Democratic leader. 
Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have 
voted on this before. It seems that is what we have been doing the last few weeks—revoting. Vote once and vote again. The results are going to be the same. We have made it clear we are not going to proceed to appropriations bills under the Republicans’ partisan budg-et. We have 12 appropriations bills, not 1. We have 12. 
We seek a budget agreement that 
fairly prevents mindless sequester cuts to defense and to the middle class. I am gratified that our votes on this meas-ure have caused the Republican leader to acknowledge publicly that we need to negotiate an end to this fiscal crisis that has been created by the Repub-licans. 
As for this upcoming vote, there is no 
reason for Senators to change their votes from how they voted earlier this year. This is yet another case of the Republicans just wasting time rather than addressing the real deal. Another revote. 
We read in this morning’s papers that 
the Republican leader intends to bring a clean continuing resolution before the Senate later this week. Congratula-tions. We appreciate that very much. But bringing it to a conclusion now is certainly very important because we are running out of time. The end of the fiscal year is now. On September 30, we need more money or the government will shut down. It is not as though we are making up something. They have done it before. And who has been hurt? The American middle class more than anyone else. 
I hope we will just move on to the 
business at hand. The business at hand is to make sure the government does not close. We have cooperated every way we can. We are not asking for re-
votes on tearing down the tree numer-ous times. We have agreed to that. We are not trying in any way to proce-durally stop us from moving to impor-tant funding measures. So I hope we can move on past this as quickly as possible. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority whip. 
PAIN-CAPABLE UNBORN CHILD PROTECTION BILL  
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, unfor-
tunately, our Democratic friends have now blocked another vital piece of leg-islation from moving forward by a vote of 54 to 42. The cloture vote on the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act has failed on that cloture vote. But I want to point out to our colleagues that this is not the end of this discus-sion. This is the beginning of the dis-cussion once again. 
I would point out that over the years 
we have actually been making some progress in favor of an agenda that fa-vors life. In 2007 eight Senate Repub-licans opposed defunding Planned Par-enthood, by 2011 five Senate Repub-licans opposed defunding Planned Par-enthood, and in August just one Sen-ator opposed it by voting to filibuster the bill. Last time we had zero Demo-cratic Senators vote on such a meas-ure. In August we got two. 
The pain-capable bill that was 
blocked by Senate Democrats last year, of course, is what we just voted on again. Today we had an opportunity to be on the record and advocate for what is a top priority for pro-life groups. 
There is legislation that has passed 
in the House of Representatives— namely, the born-alive piece of legisla-tion, which really shouldn’t divide Con-gress the way perhaps the defunding of Planned Parenthood bill has because at some point, whether you are pro-choice or pro-life, hopefully we can agree that a child who is basically grown to full- term in their mother should be pro-tected from the abortion industries. I think we are going to have other op-portunities to vote on that issue. 
The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Pro-
tection Act is really a moral impera-tive for our Nation. It says a lot about who we are as a country. This Chamber just had the opportunity to send a clear message that America is a nation that seeks to advance a culture of life and opportunity for everyone, particu-larly those who are the most vulner-able. As a father of two daughters, I don’t understand the rationale of some of my colleagues on the other side. Do they believe there should be no limita-tion on access to abortion at all? No limit? 
Well, we will have an opportunity for 
another vote that perhaps will give them a chance to go on record on the born-alive bill that passed the House of Representatives last week. Unfortu-nately, I think it appears that by blocking this vote, some of our col-leagues were simply unable to cast aside the pressures of special interest

groups to take a stand for life. But it is 
important to note for pro-life Members such as myself that protecting the sanctity of life is an ongoing mission, and it doesn’t end with this one vote. 
Mr. President, briefly on another 
matter, we will shortly consider or re-consider another vote that should be a clear-cut issue. This vote would make sure that our military has what they need in order to protect our country and deal with the rising and diverse threats to national security occurring around the world. This will most point-edly help our troops maintain their status as the greatest military. The Defense appropriations bill includes simple initiatives that make sense and serve our troops well, such as giving them a well-deserved pay raise. 
I think it is worth reminding those 
here today that this will be the second opportunity to move this legislation forward. Earlier, our colleagues across the aisle blocked this Defense appro-priations bill that provides critical funding for our troops and refused to allow it to move forward. That legisla-tion, as the majority leader pointed out, was voted overwhelmingly out of the Appropriations Committee in June with the support of many of my col-leagues on the other side of the aisle who then turned and voted against it on the floor. I guess, in the famous words of John Kerry, they were for it before they were against it. 
So the bill we will be considering and 
voting on shortly is not a piece of par-tisan legislation, but holding up this legislation is unfortunately indicative of a larger strategy of keeping the Sen-ate tied in knots and making it impos-sible for it to function as intended. If the goal is to stymie real progress, I would have to congratulate our friends across the aisle. But unfortunately they have taken as a hostage in this partisan political fight the very mili-tary which they claim to support and which I believe they do support, but their vote certainly does not indicate that when they vote against funding our troops. 
I would point out that in 2013 the 
Democratic leader himself advocated for something we call regular order around here when it comes to setting our Nation’s fiscal policy. 
Fortunately, this year, under the new 
majority, we were able to pass a budget for the first time since 2009. But then what should have happened after that is the Appropriations Committee should have done its work—in fact, it did do its work—and then those bills would come to the floor and they would be voted on by the Senate. But that is what our Democratic colleagues have blocked. I think they have gone a bridge too far in blocking the funding for our military, particularly with the headlines we see in the newspapers and the conflicts arising and spreading across the world. 
So this is the first time in 6 years 
that the Appropriations Committee has approved and reported out all 12 appro-priations bills. But then these bills be-
came hostage to something our Demo-cratic friends called ‘‘filibuster sum-mer’’—a political strategy telegraphed from the pages of the Washington Post just last June to block all appropria-tions bills. 
I said it then and it bears repeating 
that stifling debate and blocking votes is a pretty lousy political strategy, and it is not what the American people sent us here to do. It is what lost my friends across the aisle control of this Cham-ber nearly a year ago. It is a losing strategy, it is bad policy, and it is cyn-ical politics. It is simply shameful to take these partisan political fights to the point of denying our troops the re-sources they need in order to do their job. 
So the Appropriations Committee 
has done its work on a bipartisan basis and painstakingly drafted, considered, and passed all 12 appropriations bills. Now this Chamber should do our job and move those appropriations bills forward, starting with the Defense ap-propriations bill. 
Now that the majority leader has 
moved to reconsider that failed vote, earlier blocked by our Democratic col-leagues, I hope our friends across the aisle have had a chance to reconsider and to think carefully about the rami-fications of their decision and that they will join us in moving this bill forward. The world is far too dangerous and the threats are far too real to take this important piece of legislation hos-tage and prevent the resources going to the troops, who simply deserve it. 
Quite simply, we have no time to lose 
when it comes to fulfilling one of our most basic duties to the American peo-ple: defending against threats to na-tional security. I would urge my fellow colleagues to join me in moving this important bill forward. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The as-
sistant Democratic leader. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I respect 
my colleague from Texas, the majority whip. I disagree with his conclusion. I am vice chairman of the Defense Ap-propriations Subcommittee. The chair-man is Senator C
OCHRAN of Mississippi. 
The two of us and our staffs worked night and day to put together a good Defense appropriations bill. I think we did a good job. 
The problem is, there is a difference 
between the Democrats and the Repub-licans about the total amount to be spent on the defense budget. The Re-publicans suggest that we should take $38 billion and put it into the defense budget but not to add a similar amount to the nondefense budget. I could go onto the arcane language of OCO and all of the sequestration. I am going to try to avoid that and keep this at a level where most people understand what we are talking about. 
Our concern is not about funding the 
military on the Democratic side. We wholeheartedly support that, all of us. Not a single Democrat dissents from what I have just said, but the question 
is whether or not the money that is going to be invested in nondefense agencies is also going to be protected in this appropriations process. That is all we have asked for. 
We are willing to put $38 billion more 
into defense, let’s put the same amount in nondefense. What is nondefense? Nondefense, frankly, includes a lot of appropriations programs that are criti-cally important to middle-income fam-ilies across America. Are we going to continue to fund educational programs so that the kids of working families have a shot at college? That is non-defense spending. 
Are we going to make sure that we 
make the basic processes of govern-ment be protected when it comes to in-vesting in nondefense? May I give you an example? Medical research. Is that worth putting money into? From the Republican side, that is nondefense, that is not really that important. I think it is critically important. Once every 67 seconds in America, one of our citizens is diagnosed with Alz-heimer’s—once every 67 seconds. 
It is a tragedy. It is an expensive 
tragedy. It cost us over $200 billion last year just to care for Alzheimer’s pa-tients in America under Medicare and Medicaid. That does not even come close to calculating the sacrifices made by family members on behalf of those who are suffering from Alzheimer’s. So should we invest more money in Alz-heimer’s research? Should we put more money into an effort to delay the onset of Alzheimer’s or, God willing, find a cure? Of course we should. That is non-defense spending. That is not a priority of the other side of the aisle. 
What we have said to them is: We 
need to sit down and work this out. Be fair to defense to keep us strong and safe as a nation, but make those crit-ical investments in programs that make a difference to middle-income families across America. What we are asking for today is nothing new. As the Senator from Texas reminded us, we took a vote on this issue. It was over 3 months ago—the same vote. We took the same vote we are about to take at noon today as to whether or not we should have this lopsided appropria-tion, money to the defense budget but not to the nondefense budget. We said no. Balance it. Be fair. Be as concerned about middle-income families in Amer-ica as you are about the defense of our Nation. Let the budget reflect that. 
But they said no. So we are back 
again. It was on June 18 when the lead-ership on the Democratic side of the aisle, aided by others who felt the same way, sent a letter to the Republicans and said: Let’s not waste any time shouting at one another and giving speeches on the floor. Let’s sit down in closed, bipartisan negotiations and work out the budget, bring the Presi-dent in. He is critical. We need his par-ticipation. But let’s work it out. 
We wrote that letter on June 18. Here 
we are more than 3 months later in the

same predicament. We should have 
taken the time before now—days before the end of the fiscal year, at the end of September—to sit down and work this out by budget negotiation. But they re-fused. They don’t want to sit down. 
Instead, they want us to go through 
these show votes. Last week—last week we had five unnecessary separate votes on the Iran agreement. We had already established, by public announcement of every Senator and by an open public vote, where we stood. Senator M
CCON-
NELL insisted on spending another 
week and five more votes on exactly the same thing with exactly the same outcome. What a waste of Senate time. 
Look at this week. This week is a 
challenge because of the visit of the Pope and the Jewish holy day, but in-stead of dealing with substantive issues, this week we have allowed two Republican Presidential candidates who are Senators to have their day on the floor. I think we should be rolling up our sleeves and tackling this issue. I don’t want to see a government shut-down. We allowed the Senator from Texas to do that a few years ago, and we paid a heavy price for it. He has now threatened to do it again. He likes shutting down our government, thinks that is a great expression of his effec-tiveness as a leader. So be it. Maybe it is to some, but not to most. 
Instead we should be involved in real 
budget negotiations. I want to tell you, this idea of a continuing resolution— what is a continuing resolution? It says: Spend the money this year the same way you spent it last year. What if your family had that charge? What if we said: Spend the same amount for groceries and utilities that you did last year, spend it this year. You would say: Wait a minute, that does not reflect the things that have changed in my family. My son is off to college. We are changing the place where we live and such. 
That is not the kind of thing that 
you would respect. That is what a con-tinuing resolution does. It continues to spend money the same way. It wastes taxpayers’ money. Senator C
OCHRAN  
and I, on a bipartisan basis, came up with a better approach. It is an appro-priations bill which we think keeps us safe and spends our defense dollars wisely. So let’s not get comfortable with a continuing resolution. It is not good for the Department of Defense, not good for the men and women in uniform who risk their lives for us every single day. 
It is important for us to do the re-
sponsible thing and move forward. Let’s not waste any more time with re-peat votes and show-boat votes; let’s instead focus our time on negotiating a sound budget. 
On June 18, we sent an invitation to 
the Republicans to sit down and nego-tiate a budget. The invitation is still open, but we are running out of time. It is important that the President be in that negotiation. It has been 96 days since the last vote we had on this issue. We are going to face it again in just a 
few moments. 
There has not been any progress 
made on budget negotiations. I ask the Republican leadership of the House and Senate: What are you waiting for? When are you going to sit down and govern? When are you going to sit down and work out problems instead of dreaming up new ways to shut down the Government of the United States of America? 
There are signs we are headed back 
to the same old process that was used before. By the end of the week, they are talking about filibusters on the Re-publican side, and staying in all night, and maybe we will hear another Dr. Seuss book read to us in the middle of the night by the Texas Senator. 
I am not sure what lies ahead, but 
what the American people are sick and tired of is what they see on the Senate floor today. They want us to do our work. They want us to compromise, to agree, to do what is best for this Na-tion. 
Having one show vote after another 
does not accomplish that. I ask my col-leagues: Work together. I ask the lead-ers on the Republican side: Instead of one more monotonous, predicable vote after another, should we not sit down and work out a budget negotiation that serves our Nation, not only the defense budget, but all of America, including middle-income families. 
I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Mississippi. 
Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I urge 
the Senate to support the motion to proceed to the Department of Defense appropriations bill for fiscal year 2016. The Committee on Appropriations ap-proved the bill on June 11 by a vote of 27 to 3. The bill provides $489.1 billion in base funding, and $86.8 billion in overseas contingency operations, which is consistent with both the fiscal year 2016 budget resolution and the Defense Subcommittee’s allocation. 
The bill provides funding to protect 
the security interests of our country. The Senate should return to regular order starting with this national secu-rity legislation. It is a bipartisan bill that provides the President, as Com-mander in Chief, with the resources to protect our Nation. I urge the Senate to approve proceeding to this bill.

We, the undersigned Senators, in accord-

Mitch McConnell, John Cornyn, Marco

Mr. M CCONNELL. I ask unanimous 
consent to waive the mandatory quorum call for this cloture motion. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
was struck by some things the Demo-cratic leader said this morning about funding the Government. First he said it was not the Democrats’ responsi-bility to work toward sensible solu-tions because ‘‘we’ve helped in any way we can, we’ve not held up anything procedurally.’’ 
That was just minutes before his 
party voted again to hold up a bill pro-cedurally that would fund the military at a time with unprecedented inter-national threats. Then he said this: ‘‘We’ve made it clear that we’re not going to proceed to appropriations 
bills’’—talk about a mixed message. 
His party has crowed for months 
about its filibuster summer strategy of blocking every last funding bill in the hopes of taking Americans to the brink. They have now succeeded in tak-ing us there. They think it is the only way to force America to accept their demands for more debt and more bu-reaucracy. But that is not what Ameri-cans want. Americans want Democrats to now work with us responsibly to help our country get out of the situa-tion that they, in fact, have engi-neered. 
The bill before us would do that. It 
would keep the government funded through the fall while adhering to the bipartisan spending levels already agreed to by both parties. For 1 year, it would defund Planned Parenthood and protect women’s health by funding community health clinics with the $235 million instead. This would allow us to press the pause button as we inves-tigate the serious scandals surrounding Planned Parenthood. 
I know Democrats have already 
blocked virtually every bill to fund the government this year, but I am asking them to allow the Senate to fund the government now. I know Democrats have relied on Planned Parenthood as a political ally, but they must be moved by the horrifying images we have seen. Can they not resolve to protect wom-en’s health instead of their powerful political friends? 
I am not happy that we have been 
forced into pursuing a CR instead of the normal appropriations process. After all, for the first time in 6 years, a Senate under new leadership actually passed a budget. After all, for the first time in 6 years, a Senate under new leadership passed all 12 necessary bills to fund the government out of com-mittee. It is truly regrettable to see the actions of the party on the other side that led us to this point. The bill before us now represents the best op-tion to keep the government funded, to protect women’s health, to press the pause button on funding for a scandal- plagued organization as we investigate further into some truly shocking alle-gations. 
ORDER FOR RECESS  
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Senate stand in recess until 2:15 p.m. today for the weekly conference meetings. 
Mr. REID. Mr. President, will my 
friend allow me to speak prior to that? 
Mr. M
CCONNELL. After the remarks 
of the Democratic leader. 
I am sorry, Mr. President. I didn’t re-
alize the Democratic leader wished to speak. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The Democratic leader. Mr. REID. Mr. President, I served in 
the House of Representatives. It was standard over there for Members at committee hearings and on the floor to always say: I ask unanimous consent to revise and extend my remarks. That 
was standard practice in the House. We don’t do that here. But certainly in the House it would have been totally inap-
propriate to say: I ask unanimous con-sent to revise and extend the remarks of my friend from California or wher-ever they might be from, but that is basically what my friend, the Repub-lican leader, has done. 
He has no right to make up what I 
said this morning. What I said this morning is in the R
ECORD . The fact is 
that he can’t rewrite what I said. Here is what I said earlier today: We have made it clear that we will not proceed to appropriations bills under the Re-publicans’ partisan budget. That is what I said verbatim this morning. 
We seek a budget agreement that 
fairly prevents mindless sequester cuts to defense and the middle class alike. We want negotiations to start, and I said I am gratified our votes on this measure have caused the Republican leader to acknowledge that we need to negotiate, and that is true. I am happy to see that, and I have publicly com-mended the Republican leader for the statements he has made in recent days about how we need a clean CR. I also said this morning, as far as the upcom-ing vote, that there is no reason for Senators to change their votes from how they voted earlier, and that was on the Defense appropriations revote. This is yet another case of the Republican leader just wasting time before we ad-dress the real deal. 
We read in this morning’s papers that 
the Republican leader plans to bring a clean continuing resolution before the Senate later this week. That is not a day too soon. That is what I said, and that is what I say again. 
This vote on Planned Parenthood 
this Thursday is another rerun vote. I do not in any way take away from peo-ple who feel strongly about their posi-tion on abortion, Planned Parenthood, and the 20-week abortion. I understand how strongly people feel on both sides of that issue, but this is yet another rerun vote. 
The Republicans—in the 9 months 
they have been running the Senate— have had more revotes than any other majority party in the history of our country. They are No. 1 in revotes. We have revoted and revoted and revoted. We voted on Planned Parenthood ear-lier this year in August, and we voted on abortion today. How many times will the Republican leader need to re-turn to this same show vote? 
We are going to prevent a govern-
ment shutdown with a clean con-tinuing resolution. That is what he said, and I agree with him. 
When will we avoid a default by ad-
dressing the debt limit? When will we address cyber security and the highway trust fund? All of these things are im-portant to do, and I am anxious to get them done. We have a lot of problems out there in our great country. We have so many things to do. We haven’t addressed the energy problems that face this Nation.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6870 September 22, 2015 
We have fires that are ravaging the 
great Western part of the United States. The government entities that are fighting these fires don’t have the money to fight them. The two worst fires in the history of the State of Cali-fornia are just being tamped down, but they are still not completed. Hundreds of homes have burned. We have a coun-try that is burning up. 
The Governor of Nevada is a good 
man. He is a Republican Governor, and I have great admiration for him. I sug-gested his name to the President of the United States to become a Federal judge, and he accepted my rec-ommendation. He then resigned that position to run for Governor. He is now conducting a 3-day event in Nevada— bringing people in from all over the West and all over the country—to talk about what is happening to Nevada. We are having so many problems in Ne-vada. Lake Mead is drying up, and Lake Tahoe is having tremendous prob-lems. We have a snowpack that basi-cally doesn’t exist. We don’t have many rivers in Nevada, but those little rivers that we have, including the mighty Colorado, are in deep trouble. We have snowpack in upper Colorado that evaporates before it gets into the river. 
I am willing to do whatever is nec-
essary to move forward in funding this government, but to blame us for not funding the government is really car-rying things to extremes. 
I have completed my statement, Mr. 
President. 
Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I sug-
gest the absence of a quorum. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the 
Senator withhold his suggestion of the absence of a quorum? 
Mr. COCHRAN. I withhold my sug-
gestion.

HIRE MORE HEROES ACT OF 2015— 
Continued 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Dakota. 
Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent for the following Senators to speak about the impor-tance of the reauthorization of the Ex-port-Import Bank. I ask that Senator C
OONS be recognized for 5 minutes but 
first that Senator K INGbe recognized 
for 5 minutes and that I be recognized for 10 minutes, reserving the remaining time for others who may join us. 
I wish to initially yield time to Sen-
ator K
ING. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The Senator from Maine. EXPORT -IMPORT BANK REAUTHORIZATION  
Mr. KING. Mr. President, as the Sen-
ator from North Dakota just men-tioned, we are here on the floor to talk about the importance of the reauthor-ization of the Export-Import Bank. There are a lot of issues here that are contentious and controversial, and there are arguments to be made on both sides, but this one, frankly, puz-zles me. I do not understand why the Congress has not moved with alacrity to reauthorize an agency of the Federal Government that fills a gap in the pri-vate market which is not filled by pri-vate enterprise, which has been in busi-ness for over 80 years, and which helps and assists businesses large and small across America and returns money to the Treasury. This is not a cost to the Treasury. This is not some kind of budget bill that increases our deficit. This actually will increase revenue be-cause this agency makes a net return for the taxpayers. 
When General Electric last week an-
nounced the possible layoff of 500 peo-ple across the country and the moving of jobs overseas—because virtually every other industrialized country in the world has an export-import bank, an export promotion authority that is comparable to what we have, General Electric says: We are going to have to go where they provide that kind of sup-port. 
One staff member of the committee 
in the other body, which has voted to not reauthorize this, said: Well, for General Electric, this is a drop in the bucket. 
Well, of those 400 or 500 jobs General 
Electric is talking about, 80 of them are at a General Electric plant in Ban-gor, ME, and 80 good jobs in Bangor, ME, is not a drop in the bucket. 
I would invite that staff member to 
come to Bangor, ME, and talk to the families of those people who are going to lose their jobs because of this ridicu-lous policy of not reauthorizing a gov-ernmental agency that is serving the public needs of this country, particu-larly in an age of expanding global trade. We are competing with the rest of the world, and we are shooting our-selves in the foot in the process. It sim-ply makes no sense. 
I have visited with small businesses 
in Maine—as few as 35 jobs which de-pend upon the actions of the Export- Import Bank in order to be able to fi-nance their receivables from foreign countries and then they can compete in the international marketplace. 
There is simply no reason to not 
move with some speed to reauthorize this agency. We are penalizing Amer-ican businesses in global competition for no good reason that I can discern. If there are issues at the Bank with its management or whatever, let’s fix those. Let’s have hearings. Let’s find what the problems are and fix them but not eliminate an agency that is doing good and returning money to the tax-payers, particularly at this moment in American and world history where international trade and world exports 
are so important. 
I hope my colleagues in both Houses, 
on both sides of the aisle will join with us to make a simple reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank so it can con-tinue to do the good work it has done on behalf of businesses in Maine and North Dakota and Texas and California and New York and all over this coun-try. 
This is just common sense. There are 
things around here that I understand we have controversies about and we can argue about, but I have not heard any argument that holds any water as to why this agency should not be con-tinued and allowed to provide the bene-fits it has and does and will do for the businesses and, more importantly, the employees of those businesses all across the country. 
Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware. 
Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I wish to 
address the issue of the Export-Import Bank reauthorization, if I might, for a few moments. My colleague, the Sen-ator from the State of Maine, has just spoken to it, and I expect my colleague from the State of North Dakota will also follow along the same lines. I wish to join with my colleagues here today in standing up for American manufac-turing and in standing up for American businesses that rely on the Export-Im-port Bank for the critical financing they need to export their products to the markets of the world. Many of us have said the same thing on this floor over the weeks or months since its au-thorization expired. 
It is striking to me that because of 
the views of a few Members of the House and Senate, this valuable tool which has helped American companies sell their goods around the world for more than 80 years has been allowed to expire. As we just heard from the Sen-ator from Maine, the Export-Import Bank actually operates at no cost to the taxpayer, and it is something that has helped American businesses sell al-most $30 billion in goods and supported more than 150,000 American jobs last year alone. So I really think the oppo-sition to the reauthorization of the Ex-port-Import Bank is badly misguided. It is my hope that we will find some bi-partisan path toward the restoration of this critical tool. 
In my first 4 years in the Senate, I 
was the chair of the Africa sub-committee on the Foreign Relations Committee, and I took advantage of 
that opportunity to learn a great deal more about this vast continent with 54 countries and the opportunities it pro-vides for American companies to sell their exported products to their grow-ing markets. 
Most folks think of the Export-Im-
port Bank as principally providing fi-nancing for a few very large compa-nies—companies such as General Elec-tric and Boeing—and it does provide es-sential financing for their export sales,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6871 September 22, 2015 
but those big companies also have 
enormous supplier chains that employ folks all over the country. I could focus today on the important sales that Boe-
ing and GE have made to Africa and its growing market, but I wish to focus on a very small company with an impor-tant story that I think helps illu-minate why Ex-Im financing matters. 
This little company is called Acrow 
Bridge. Although it is headquartered in New Jersey, it has a manufacturing plant right near Lewisburg, PA. That plant rolls out steel bridges. It is in Milton, PA. It has been making bridges from the same model Patton’s troops used as they rolled across France and Germany during the Second World War, modular bridges that are easy to install in remote places without a whole lot of infrastructure support. 
Why does that matter? Because they 
recently successfully competed for big contracts to sell hundreds of bridges to areas in Africa, including countries like Cameroon or Zambia that badly need infrastructure. 
Who are their competitors? Com-
parable companies from China and from Europe that are also seeking to sell into these growing markets. 
Why do I care? I am from Delaware. 
I care about manufacturing all over this country, but this Acrow Bridge company ships their bridges from Pennsylvania to Delaware, where, in New Castle, the Voigt & Schweitzer hot dip galvanizing company takes each bridge and dips it in zinc and galva-nizes it before it is put on a ship and sent off to places all over the world. Voigt & Schweitzer doesn’t employ thousands of people, but it employs dozens of people. Acrow Bridge in Mil-ton, PA, doesn’t employ thousands of people, but it employs dozens of people. Manufacturing across our country critically depends on access to export markets. 
I recently had a chance to meet up 
with the Acrow Bridge export sales spe-cialist at a conference in Gabon in Af-rica. He was alarmed that in the ab-sence of Ex-Im financing, his key com-petitors are much more likely to suc-ceed in the next contract and the next contract and the next contract. 
We folks are just unilaterally dis-
arming here in the fight to access the growing markets of the world, and I can’t for the life of me fathom why we have done this. As my colleague from Maine said, if there are issues with the Ex-Im Bank, put them on the floor, put them on the table, and let’s address them. 
In my experience, when the Bank 
makes a loan to American businesses, it is not replacing private capital that would otherwise have been making that loan. Most often, it supplements private capital or makes a private bank more inclined to put up its own. And more often than not, Ex-Im serves as the lender of last resort, especially when you are financing sales into risky, growing markets in countries like Cameroon, Zambia, or elsewhere in Africa. I don’t think the Export-Import 
Bank is doing something best left to the private sector; I think it picks up where the private sector leaves off and it provides key financing to level the global playing field and make it pos-sible for our manufacturers, for our small businesses to compete around the world. 
Frankly, most of our competitors 
have much more robust financing available for their export sales than the Export-Import Bank provides. I just can’t fathom why we would allow American businesses to be put at such a key competitive disadvantage. It is my real hope that before it is too late, we will take up and reauthorize the Ex-port-Import Bank. 
There were disappointing and con-
cerning announcements just in recent weeks by General Electric and by Boe-ing that they are already moving em-ployment overseas or they are seri-ously considering it. GE just an-nounced they are moving a turboprop engine development center to Europe because they can’t remain competitive in the absence of Ex-Im financing. That is going to cause the loss of 500 jobs in a community here in America. And Boeing has made even more concerning announcements. 
I think it is critical that we in Con-
gress come together and show that we care about American jobs and that we care about fighting for American man-ufacturers because we recognize that 95 percent of the opportunity in the world is in the growing sectors that are rep-resented by the export markets of the world. 
It is my hope that we can find a way 
through this, that the unwillingness to reopen the Bank, which is sending the wrong message to the world markets, is something we can come together and address. At a time when our economy is gaining steam and Americans are going back to work, we need to con-tinue to help American companies to compete around the world, not make it harder. So I think we should stop play-ing politics with American jobs, stop pursuing an ideological agenda, and re-authorize the Export-Import Bank im-mediately. 
Thank you. With that, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Dakota. 
Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, we 
have just heard what I think is almost a horror story from two great Sen-ators, one representing 80 jobs, one rep-resenting maybe just dozens of jobs, but every one of those jobs matters in America. We come here every week and we say we are here fighting for the middle class. We are here fighting to build the American economy. We are here fighting to make sure our manu-facturing and our businesses are com-petitive in a highly charged and highly competitive world. And we have an in-stitution that is critical to making sure we have access to these export markets, doesn’t cost the Treasury a dime, is used by large corporations and 
small corporations alike, and it is sup-ported by Democrats and Republicans. But why do we shut down the Ex-Im Bank? 
I serve on the banking committee, 
and we had a hearing. The bill we have been considering these many months is the Kirk-Heitkamp bill. I have taken responsibility for addressing some of 
the concerns about the Ex-Im Bank and looking at how we can reform some of the things that are legitimate con-cerns about how the Bank operates. But I will tell my colleagues from that hearing that what we saw is the Na-tional Association of Manufacturers, we saw the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. And we might imagine that those two witnesses were the Republican wit-nesses. They were not the Republican witnesses; they were the Democratic witnesses. The Republican witnesses came from intellectual think tanks. They came from institutions of higher learning with conservative think tanks. They all had a theory about the Ex-Im Bank. I asked them a simple question when it came time for me to ask them a question. I asked every one of those persons who represented a think tank or represented an academic institution how many jobs they have created, what their output is, what their contribution to the gross domes-tic product was. They didn’t have much of an answer. I said: Why should I be-lieve what you are telling me in terms of this being the slippery slope toward the demise of democracy as we know it, which is really how the Ex-Im Bank has been categorized against the word of the National Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manu-facturers. 
This has become an irrational ideo-
logical fight. And, unfortunately, we have irrational ideological fights al-most daily in the Congress, to no good end for the American people. But this Senator will say this: This fight has devastating consequences. We now have shut down the Bank. No new cred-it is coming in for 2
1⁄2months—21⁄2 
months where a small manufacturer in Delaware may say: Well, how have we done this in the past? How have we taken on currency risk? How have we taken on debt risk? How have we guar-anteed this in the past? Call your local bank. Do you know what the banker is going to tell you? Call the Ex-Im Bank because in spite of what they tell you, somehow magically in this market will emerge a private institution that will carry on the responsibility of the Ex- Im Bank. 
That is not reality. The largest sup-
porters of the Ex-Im Bank are those fi-nancial institutions that want to con-tinue to provide credit and help grow those American businesses that are putting Americans back to work. 
One of the things I did want to talk 
about today is that way too often we hear about the so-called bank of Boe-ing, the bank of GE, and how it is that this institution helps only those large

manufacturers. What I would tell you, 
first, is if you look at the business model of GE or the business model of Boeing, what they do is assemble. They assemble products that are manufac-tured all across the country, and the components are manufactured in large shops and small shops all the way down the supply chain to small communities that are doing things in Jamestown, ND, that are growing jobs. In the com-munities that you just heard about in Bangor, ME, and communities in Dela-ware, they are building out those jobs. Those are the people we are hearing from. Those are the people who are shaking their heads, saying: Why is it that you guys talk all the time about helping American business, growing the economy, growing exports? You talk all the time about jobs and the need to bring back the innovation, and you curtail and limit my ability to grow and, quite frankly, my ability to survive. How does that happen? 
I want to talk about the equipment 
wholesalers that will see a negative im-pact. Look at this—35 to 40 percent, if Ex-Im isn’t reauthorized. 
Equipment wholesalers stated that 
without the Export-Import Bank, it will be at a disadvantage in increas-ingly globalized markets. No access— do you know why? Because there are 80 other countries that have export credit agencies. 
The first thing China and India did 
when Asia slowed down, when they knew their economies were beginning to suffer some of the consequences of slow growth—guess what they did. The first thing they did is pump more money into their export credit agen-cies—in fact, billions more into those export credit agencies. Then, when this institution shut down the Ex-Im Bank, they shouted: Hip, hip, hooray. They knew that not only did they have money to capitalize and to guarantee these sales, but they were operating in a market where we have unilaterally, economically disarmed in the export market. 
When we go back and take a look at 
how the U.S. Export-Import Bank has supported more than 850,000 jobs, when we look at Wahpeton, ND—Wahpeton, ND, is the largest town next to my hometown. Not a lot of people live there, but for the people who work there, those jobs matter. Look at that—almost $1 million—and those jobs are being threatened today because of the inactivity of this institution. 
Sixty percent of WCCO Belting’s an-
nual sales and revenues come from cus-tomers who are located outside the United States of America. This is a small town in Wahpeton, ND. Many of the pages here probably didn’t even know such a place existed, but the peo-ple who work there are doing a great job, and they are contributing to the global economy. More importantly, they are building up their local econ-omy, and they are building up the U.S. manufacturing and trade deficit. This is something I know the Presiding Offi-cer, as a former member of the OMB 
and somebody who has watched the American economy, is very concerned about, making sure that the trade def-icit is favorable to us, that we are ac-tually exporting more than we are im-porting. That is how we grow our econ-omy. That is called new wealth cre-ation. 
When we look at not just manufac-
turing, but we look at J.M. Grain, a business that I visited—built out of nothing by a mom and pop who put their heads together and said: This is something I think we can do. They built this great business. The Export- Import Bank provides credit and credit insurance needed for J.M. Grain to ex-port its products. If Ex-Im isn’t reau-thorized, J.M. Grain may be forced to sell its products to larger corporations that can finance the exports—consoli-dation—because we can’t take care of small business. 
Even though we hear the platitudes 
and all of the statements quite to the contrary on the floor of the Senate and the Congress, that we care about small business, we do nothing in terms of our actions to really prove that. 
Amity Technology is a great story. 
This is a family—the developers of this company come from the family who de-veloped the Bobcat skid-steer loaders, if you can imagine that. That company was sold and has moved on, yet those young entrepreneurs—those young in-ventors—have taken the next step. This is a company that is absolutely dependent on the Export-Import Bank. If you look at this, it has supported more than $50 million in exports in the last decade. Without the help of the Export-Import Bank, Amity would lose at least 10 percent of its business. 
Story after story in America—this is 
just North Dakota. We can tell you more stories about what is happening in North Dakota, but stories after sto-ries in the State of North Dakota and across the country include small busi-nessmen and small businesswomen who are shaking their heads, saying: What did we do? Why is it that something such as the Export-Import Bank, which is so critical to our being successful and doesn’t cost the American tax-payers a dime. Why is it that this is so hard? 
I have to try and explain how it is 
that we got 64 votes for the Export-Im-port Bank here on the floor of the Sen-ate—a huge majority. We think we ac-tually have the support of about 67 Members of the Senate—a veto-proof majority, if you look at it that way. 
And we know that over in the House 
of Representatives there is well over 50 percent of the Members of that body that would vote for the Ex-Im Bank. Where is the hangup? Where is the problem? 
Quite honestly, the problem is with 
leadership because if this isn’t a pri-ority or if the Ex-Im Bank may be a problem for a Speaker who has a small but vocal group of conservatives who hate the Ex-Im Bank and who have made this their celebrity cause, then 
we will just send it over here and we will try to sneak it in. That is kind of the idea, right? We need a vehicle. 
I hear that so often for good ideas 
and for things we know we have major-ity votes for and well over majority votes for: We need a vehicle. I joke to my staff that I am going to introduce a bill, and it is going to be called ‘‘the vehicle.’’ Then we will be able to do ev-erything we have to do to keep the American economy moving forward— the things that we can all agree on— because then, maybe, the American public will see something that is not rancor and disagreement. They will see us listening to American business, to American manufacturers, to American workers, and they will hear that we ac-tually will respond, and we will move this bill forward. 
Now there is a lot of talk that we 
may not get this done in September. No, it doesn’t look very good. And if you had told me when we shut down the Bank in June, if you had told me that we were going to open it up in July, I would have said: That is not likely. We will get the Bank reopened in July. 
July came and went, and the promise 
of the vehicle, which was supposed to be the Transportation bill, never mate-rialized. And the promise of putting it somewhere where we could actually get it done never materialized. So we went home in August, and I said: Well, we will get it done in September. We will figure out a way to reauthorize the Ex- Im Bank in September because we can’t shut it down for that long. 
September has come and gone. We 
have got other priorities—no oppor-tunity for floor time. Now we are look-ing at October, and the promise once again in October is that we are going to put it on the Transportation bill. Well, this Senator has heard that promise twice. So I think it is now time to ask for consideration of this bill. 
People say: We all need to reserve the 
special floor time of the Senate for really important ideas. I say that these people, the 80 people, 90 people in Ban-gor, ME, think this is an important idea. All the people now who supply GE who are looking at GE’s plan to move a lot of this manufacturing and assem-bly overseas, they think this is very important. They think American jobs, American manufacturing, our trade deficit, and our access to global mar-kets, are very important for the Con-gress to consider. 
So we have a bill that has broad bi-
partisan support: the Kirk-Heitkamp Export-Import Reauthorization bill. We can put that bill on the floor. We can move it in an expedited fashion be-cause we have a procedure to do this. When there is a will, there is a way. We can move pretty quickly to votes here if we want to, and we can pass this bill. Then we can send it over to the House of Representatives. They can put it on the floor, and they can pass this bill. It

can get sent to the President’s desk 
and get signed, and we can reopen the Export-Import Bank. We can hang out a big sign: ‘‘Open for business once again.’’ 
But the longer we wait, the longer we 
continue to allow this to become the celebrity cause of a very, very small minority of hard-core conservatives in this country, the harder it is going to be to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank. Make no mistake. At the end of the day, it is not about inside-the-belt-way politics. It is not about whether we are going to have political winners or losers. What this is about is people’s livelihoods. It is about helping Amer-ican workers do what we know we do best: innovate, create, manufacture, and export. 
I thank the Presiding Officer so much 
for the time. We will continue to be talking about the Ex-Im Bank. As you know, I almost can’t even approach a group because they think I am going to regale them with 20 hours of the Ex-Im Bank and the challenges we have with reauthorization. 
But I will tell you this: The Ex-Im 
Bank is not only about manufacturing; it is almost a metaphor for what is wrong in the Congress. What that is, is an institution that creates jobs, has broad bipartisan support, and has the ability to provide opportunity for American workers, and we shut it down because the Congress cannot figure out how to avoid a minority of people dic-tating the agenda. 
Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
TRIBUTE TO ASHLEY ALDRIDGE  
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would 
like to take a moment to share a story with Members of the Senate and those following us this evening. It is an amazing story of the selfless courage of a young Illinois mother who many are calling—with good reason—a guardian angel. 
Ashley Aldridge of Auburn, IL, was 
home making lunch for two little ba-bies last Tuesday. She heard someone outside crying for help. She looked out her kitchen window and saw an elderly man in a wheelchair on the railroad tracks near her mobile home. He was calling for help. 
Without a moment’s hesitation Ash-
ley asked a neighbor to stay with her kids and she ran toward the man in dis-tress. She saw the railroad guard arms coming down and heard the oncoming train. When she reached the man in the wheelchair, Earl Moorman, Ashley dis-covered that the wheel of his chair was lodged in the tracks. There was no moving it. So Ashley tried to pick up Mr. Moorman. Now, Mr. Moorman is 75 years old and he weighs about 200 pounds. Ashley could not move him. She tried again. With an Amtrak train barreling down the tracks at 81 miles an hour, Ashley Aldridge somehow, some way found the strength to lift Earl Moorman up and out of his trapped wheelchair. Not 5 seconds after 
she dragged him off the railroad track, the train hit the wheelchair and smashed it into bits. 
When the last car on the Amtrak 
train passed, Ashley looked up and saw a police car on the other side of the tracks. Someone had heard Mr. Moorman and called 911. The police were there quickly, but they could not get there fast enough to save Mr. 
Moorman. Ashley Aldridge, a 19-year- old wife and stay-at-home mom with two little kids got there in time. No wonder Earl Moorman is calling Ashley his guardian angel. 
Ashley Aldridge and Earl Moorman 
live in Auburn, IL. It is a little town about 20 miles south of my hometown of Springfield. Auburn’s mayor and town council and all the folks around town are hailing Ashley Aldridge as a hero. She is that and more. In a world in which we often hear the message that we should only be concerned about ourselves and our own families, Ashley is an inspiration. Without a moment’s hesitation this brave, young mom risked her own life to save the life of a man she had never met. It is an amaz-ing story of selfless courage. In this world filled with so many innocent peo-ple in danger, I hope we will all remem-ber and be inspired by the courage of this remarkable young woman. 
I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
RELIGIOUS LIBERTY  
Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, this is a 
historic week in Washington, DC. Later today Pope Francis will arrive in Washington for a 2-day visit. During his time here, the Holy Father will meet with President Obama, celebrate mass, canonize a new saint, and ad-dress a joint meeting of Congress. This will be the first time a Pope has ever addressed Congress. 
In light of Pope Francis’s historic 
visit, I believe today is an appropriate time to reflect on the importance of re-ligious liberty in American life. This will be the first of a series of addresses I will be delivering on this vital sub-ject. Religious liberty is an issue of deep significance to me. I come from a family of faith. I represent a State that was founded by religious pioneers flee-ing persecution. 
In my many travels, I have seen peo-
ple express religious devotion in a mul-titude of ways, affirming their belief in the Divine through song, word, and deed. I have also seen misguided gov-ernment officials limit religious ex-pression, often in the name of security or some other nebulous goal. I have seen people of courage stand up to these officials, refusing to accept claims that the commands of the State trump rights of religious belief, nor am I alone in viewing religious liberty as a vitally important subject. Indeed, throughout our history, protecting re-ligious liberty has been a priority of lawmakers and laymen alike. 
As far back as 1657, residents of the 
community known today as Flushing, NY, petitioned colonial leaders to end 
restrictions on religious practice that prevented some community members from practicing their faith. Their peti-tion, known as the Flushing Remon-strance, declared that community members should be allowed to decide for themselves how to worship. 
In 1776, 120 years later, Virginia 
adopted a declaration of rights that proclaimed in no uncertain terms that ‘‘all men are equally entitled to the free exercise of religion according to the dictates of conscience.’’ 
This was followed a decade later by 
the famous words of the First Amend-ment, which forbids Congress from making any law that prohibits the free exercise of religion. More recently, our leaders have continued to affirm the importance of religious liberty in both word and deed. In 1984, the United States joined 47 other nations in ap-proving the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which of course pro-claims that every person has a right to ‘‘manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship or observ-ance.’’ 
Four decades later, in 1800, Congress 
passed a law declaring that govern-ment may not ‘‘substantially burden a person’s exercise of religion,’’ unless doing so is necessary to further a com-pelling government interest. Presi-dents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barrack Obama have all issued procla-mations affirming the continued im-portance of religious liberty in Amer-ican life. President Obama’s most re-cent proclamation, issued on January 15 of this year, called religious freedom a ‘‘fundamental libert[y].’’ 
He declared that every person should 
be ‘‘free to choose and live their faith.’’ There can be no question that religious liberty has been a central concern throughout our Nation’s history. Over the coming weeks, I will discuss a num-ber of topics related to religious lib-erty. These topics will include, among other things, the legal and political history of religious liberty in our coun-try, the ways in which religious liberty is under attack both at home and abroad, and what we in Congress should do to protect religious freedom against such encroachments. I will also address the history and importance of religion in the public square and the ways in which religion is beneficial to society. 
Today, however, I begin with first 
principles: why religious freedom mat-ters, why it is important, why it is worth protecting. It is common, when speaking of religious liberty, to begin by noting that religious exercise is the first individual right listed in the Con-stitution. This priority of place de-notes that religious exercise has spe-cial significance. 
Of all the potential rights out there, 
both God-given and manmade, the Founders chose to list religious free-dom first. Part of this, no doubt, had to do with history. The United States ex-ists because of religious freedom. The

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6874 September 22, 2015 
Pilgrims set sail because they wanted 
to go to a place where they could prac-tice their beliefs free from state inter-ference. The Founders of Maryland similarly sought a new land where an oppressed religious minority, Catho-lics, could live out their faith openly and honestly. 
Pennsylvania was a haven for Quak-
ers and other religious groups. Al-though the motivations of colonists were multifaceted, the desire for reli-
gious freedom was a driving force be-hind many settlers’ decisions to come to America. They came to escape per-secution, to practice their religion as they wished without the need for offi-cial state sanction or the threat of state-sponsored suppression. 
But history is not the end of the 
story. There is something inherent in the nature of religious exercise that merits special protection. To explain, I first need to talk a bit about the char-acter of government. I will then con-nect my discussion back to religious liberty. Government is, at bottom, a war of wills. It is how we answer the fundamental question of all human re-lations: Who decides? 
Government is the instrument by 
which we place certain conduct off-lim-its or make other conduct compulsory and then back up those rules with threat of force. We may extol democ-racy as the best and highest form of government, while at the same time disparaging autocracy or other dictato-rial regimes, but the difference be-tween these governments is a dif-ference of form, not function. 
All governments limit individual 
freedom. The question is, Who decides what those limits are and how far they extend? When government limits free-dom, it makes a value judgment that the conduct proscribed is less impor-tant, less worthy, than whatever goal the government is seeking to accom-plish. Take the fight against drugs. Long ago, Congress made a decision that avoiding the devastating con-sequences of drug addiction and drug violence is a more worthy goal than permitting people to choose for them-selves whether to ingest certain mind- altering substances. We made a value judgment that reducing violence and preventing addiction is more important than giving people unfettered control over what they consume. 
It is easy to see why. Violence and 
addiction are tangible, devastating harms that ruin lives and destroy aspi-rations. The ability to consume mind- altering substances, by contrast, is a narrow concern that does not go to any core concept of personhood. In other areas, the calculus may be more com-plicated. Whether we are debating the proper approach to energy production, health insurance, infrastructure in-vestment, education standards or tax reform, we weigh competing values. The policy we ultimately select de-pends on which values to which we give greater weight. 
Now to religious liberty. I said ear-
lier that religious liberty merits spe-cial protection. Indeed, it deserves pre-
eminent protection against all other rights. The reason is that rights of con-science and of religious exercise go to the very heart of who we are as human beings and how we make sense of our world. There can be no higher value than enabling people to find purpose in their lives, to make sense of the sor-rows and disappointments, as well as the joys that attend life here on the Earth. 
Indeed, the choices we make about 
what we believe and about whom we stand among are the most important choices we make in life. When a person feels called by a higher power to per-form some act or to refrain from some activity, that person is defining him-self by reference to his beliefs. Those beliefs may seem irrational to some or silly to others, but to the person who holds those beliefs they make all the difference in the world. 
When government interferes with re-
ligious exercise, it seeks to insert itself into the place of God. It tells a believer that his views about what really mat-ters may be an interesting curiosity, a nice psychosocial experiment, perhaps, but that at the end of the day they are illegitimate. The state’s interests must prevail because the state is the source of justice and truth. 
What is going on is a value judgment. 
Just as with all other government de-crees, when a state commands a person to violate his religious beliefs, it makes a value judgment that the state’s objectives override all contrary concerns. It just so happens that in this case, those contrary concerns are an individual’s most personal, deeply held beliefs. 
This is a problem for three reasons: 
First, we have or are supposed to have a limited government. Our government is supposed to serve us. It is supposed to help us flourish, not vice versa. But the government that overrides reli-gious belief is not a limited govern-ment; it is a tyranny. It presumes power to decide for its citizens the most fundamental and defining choices of life: who we are, why we are here, what our purpose is, and how we find happiness. 
No decision is more fundamental to 
human existence than the decision we make regarding our relationship to the Divine. No act of government can be more intrusive or more invasive of in-dividual autonomy and free will than the act of compelling a person to vio-late his or her sincerely chosen reli-gious beliefs. We should have more hu-mility than to think we can define bet-ter than our fellow citizens the purpose of life and the ends thereof. Certainly a limited government such as ours ought not tell its people that it knows best on matters far beyond its ambit. 
Second, valuing transient policy ob-
jectives over deeply held religious be-liefs places citizens on the horns of an impossible dilemma: either obey God whose commands are eternal and unal-terable or obey the state, which con-trols life, liberty, and property here on 
Earth. There are some who seek to equate religious liberties with other forms of liberty or to downgrade it to a form of ‘‘belief liberty.’’ 
Under this view, as explained by LDS 
Apostle Dallin H. Oaks, there is noth-ing particularly special about religious liberty. It is merely the ability to be-lieve as one chooses about spiritual matters, just as one might choose a po-litical party, a favorite philosopher or a favorite actor, but there is no equiva-lency. Religious liberty alone goes to one’s conception of self of one’s place in the universe. It alone goes to those most fundamental questions that help us find purpose in our lives. What is more, it implicates duties that tran-scend mere personal choice and become obligatory in the life of the believer. 
Professor Robbie George, the chair-
man of the U.S. Commission on Inter-national Religious Freedom, explains powerfully the flaw in the claim that religious liberty is just another type of so-called belief liberty: 
The right to follow one’s conscience, and 
the obligation to respect conscience—espe-cially in matters of faith—obtain not be-cause people as autonomous agents should be able to do as they please; they obtain, and are stringent and sometimes overriding, be-cause people have duties and the obligation to fulfill them. . . . The right of conscience is a right to do what one judge’s oneself to be under an obligation to do, whether one wel-comes the obligation or must overcome strong aversion in order to fulfill it. 
When government denies religious 
freedom, it forces believers to choose between duty to God and duty to man— duty to man backed by a threat of force. No government that values its citizens’ agency and certainly no lim-ited government that exists at the suf-frage of the people should put its citi-zens to such an impossible choice. 
The third reason why valuing State 
objectives over religious beliefs is a problem is that it sets up the State as moral arbiter. I will speak only briefly to this point. 
When the State declares certain be-
liefs out of bounds or unworthy of pro-tection, it tells the world that the opinions of government officials trump rights of conscience. It tells believers that government knows best and that their benighted views—the believers’ views, that is—have been weighed and found wanting. The current wisdom, which may be contrary to the wisdom of all human history, must triumph for no reason other than it is current and currently favored by government elites. All must fall before the State, which is supreme both in matters of might and morality. 
This aggressive view of the State’s 
moral authority has no place in a sys-tem of limited government and is com-pletely contrary to our constitution. Humility should be our watchword. We should remember that we may be wrong. 
Now, this doesn’t mean religious 
freedom should be unlimited, that

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6875 September 22, 2015 
there should be no boundaries on reli-
gious exercise. When a religious prac-tice causes injury or threatens to upend important State goals, govern-ment does have a proper role to play in balancing interests. But the standard that must be met before the State in-tervenes should be very high. 
Again, we are not talking here about 
mere personal preferences, about things people would rather do or not do, all else being equal; we are talking about acts that, as Professor George puts it, individuals feel they have an obligation to do, an obligation that comes not from family or friends or from society but from God himself. 
Before we ask individuals to con-
travene commands they believe come from a higher power, we had better be sure that what we are asking is abso-lutely necessary. We had better be sure that what we are asking furthers a compelling government interest and is the only way to accomplish that inter-est. Only this standard, which requires government to exhaust all other op-tions before invading the religious lib-erty over its citizens, adequately ac-counts for the centrality of faith in the lives of believers and the proper rela-tionship between individual and State. 
Mr. President, my argument today 
has been based on first principles, on the inviolate right of each and every person to look out for himself or her-self, the purpose of life, and his or her place in the universe. It has also been based on the principle, enshrined in our Constitution, that ours is a limited government that exists to serve, not dominate, its people. 
I have purposely stayed away from 
arguing that religion is a good thing, a net benefit to society, because I believe religious freedom deserves special pro-tection separate and apart from wheth-er religion makes men and women bet-ter citizens. Religious liberty should be a protected value because the State has no authority to tell individuals how they should approach the Divine or prescribe for them the meaning of their lives. It is a matter of autonomy, a question of who serves whom. But I would be remiss if I did not briefly out-line the many ways religion and reli-gious exercise have benefited our Na-tion. 
Today, many people sadly view reli-
gion as a sort of fetter, a chain that holds us back as a society from achiev-ing our true potential. They see reli-gion as the antagonist of social justice, as a refuge for reactionaries who do not understand or who fear our modern world. This view is not only short-sighted, it is ignorant. 
The two greatest social movements 
in our Nation’s history—the abolition movement and the civil rights move-ment—were inspired by religious con-viction and led by religious leaders. We speak today of Dr. Martin Luther King, but we forget that before he was a doc-tor, he was a reverend. In 1967, the year before his death, Reverend King pro-claimed: Before I was a civil rights leader, I was a 
preacher of the Gospel. This was my first calling and it still remains my greatest com-mitment. . . . [A]ll that I do in civil rights I do because I consider it a part of my min-istry. 
Religion instills in our youth prin-
ciples of morality and right behavior. I do not claim that religion is necessary for a person to be a good citizen, but I do affirm that religion, rightly prac-ticed, instills virtues—concern for oth-ers, a desire for good, objectives beyond the mere pursuit of something pleas-ures—that lead to engaged citizens and a healthy society. Happily, religious freedom is not just a good in and of itself but is a good for society as well. 
I will have much more to say on this 
topic in a future set of remarks. For present purposes, I will conclude with this point: Religious liberty is a funda-mental feature of our Republic. It is why we exist as a nation. It helps to ex-plain why we have endured so long de-spite our many differences. It has been a bedrock of our laws for centuries and was largely uncontested until only a few years ago. It deserves continuing protection as a preeminent value be-cause it safeguards our ability as citi-zens to find purpose in our lives and to divine for ourselves who we are. It mat-ters more than any other freedom. That is why it was listed first in the Constitution. 
Too many of our fellow citizens—per-
haps even too many in this body—have lost sight of the purpose and impor-tance of religious liberty and of our duty as legislators to protect the free-dom of all citizens to believe and to act according to their beliefs. 
I will return to this theme in the 
coming weeks as I deliver additional remarks on this most crucial topic. All I can say is that religious freedom means everything to me. I think it means everything to people of good will who really have studied how this Nation came about, how it progressed, how it has overcome some of the most monumental problems in the history of the world, and how we have been so successful after all these years. 
We have a tendency in this current 
climate, in this current world to start to decry religious belief. I want to make sure that we don’t end it, that we augment it, and that we get back to where we should be as a Nation so that we can continue to maintain this great Nation as the greatest Nation with the greatest freedom and the greatest Con-stitution in the world. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.

Mr. M CCAIN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that following my remarks, the Senator from Alaska be recognized. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

PAIN-CAPABLE UNBORN CHILD PROTECTION  
Mr. M CCAIN. Mr. President, today I 
was proud and honored to vote for clo-ture on the motion to proceed to the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection 
Act, offered by my dear friend and leader, Senator G
RAHAM of South Caro-
lina. 
Nearly 17 years ago to this day, I 
came to the Senate floor to cast a vote to override then-President Clinton’s veto of the Federal partial-birth abor-tion ban and to speak out for the voice-less unborn children who were victims of that deplorable practice. As sup-porters of that effort to end partial- 
birth abortions in the United States will recall, it was a long journey to see legislation finally signed into law in 2003 but a journey fully consistent with America’s long commitment to the rights and dignity of all human life. Enacting that legislation called upon our Nation’s moral conscience in the same way our country is compelled to action in the face of injustice at home and abroad, and I believe we as a na-tion are better off for it today. 
The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Pro-
tection Act the Senate considered today is no different. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this legisla-tion to protect the lives of unborn chil-dren by banning abortions beyond the time when a child in the womb can feel pain. My support for this bill is a con-tinuation of my longstanding and un-equivocal pro-life record since I was first elected to the Senate. 
As was the case when the Senate con-
sidered the ban on partial-birth abor-tion, we have to recognize that the bill the Senate voted on today does not fit neatly into the traditional debate about whether you are pro-life or pro- choice. The bill is about banning the extreme practice of late-term abor-tions and protecting the lives of fully formed human beings who can feel real pain. These abortions occur at the be-ginning of the sixth month of preg-nancy. They end the life of a human being who has been found worthy of fetal anesthesia to dull the pain the procedure causes but somehow unwor-thy of life. I submit that to oppose this bill, to vote to allow this practice to continue to be legal in this country, is extreme and unconscionable. 
This effort puts us on the right side 
of the American people and the right side of history. This legislation has 45 cosponsors in the Senate, and it passed the House by a vote of 242 to 184 in May of this year. A recent poll found that 64 percent of Americans support restrict-ing late-term abortions. 
I am proudly pro-life because I be-
lieve this is a human rights issue inex-tricably tied to the values of our Na-tion. These are the same values that have resulted in a long-held American commitment to fighting for human rights and for the disadvantaged and the voiceless around the world. The same commitment to fighting for human life must be true in our Nation today for unborn children. 
In April 2014, Time magazine ran a 
story called ‘‘A Preemie Revolution: Cutting-edge medicine and dedicated caregivers are helping the tiniest ba-bies survive—and thrive.’’ The article

discussed remarkable medical advance-
ments that have resulted in a steadily decreasing age of viability for infants born prematurely. It details the com-plexities of caring for premature ba-bies, the challenge of seeing to things as basic as breathing for these babies, as well as the ‘‘round-the-clock SWAT team of nearly 300 [medical profes-sionals]’’ that come together at neo-natal intensive care units, NICU, to fight for these tiny lives. 
In the author’s words: 
[I]n some ways, the work of a NICU will al-
ways seem like an exercise in dispropor-tion—an army of people and a mountain of infrastructure caring for a pound of life. But it’s a disproportion that speaks very well of us. 
The painstaking fight for human life 
that goes on in NICUs around the coun-try is irreconcilable with the current status quo in our Federal law that per-mits late-term abortions. 
As we know, what is at stake in this 
debate is made all the more real and urgent by the heinous video footage showing Planned Parenthood’s role in the harvesting of unborn babies’ body parts. I was proud to vote in support of defunding Planned Parenthood while preserving Federal funding for women’s health services in facilities such as community health centers. 
I urge my colleagues to consider the 
significance of this vote today, the re-ality of the practice that this bill is aimed at prohibiting, and what permit-ting late-term abortions says about our Nation’s commitment to fighting for life and standing up for human rights when our conscience calls us to. I deep-ly regret that this body failed today to vote for the voiceless and ban late- term abortions and protect life. I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to reconsider their position on this important issue. 
I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alaska. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, lis-
tening to the last two speakers, I am reminded what a privilege and honor it is to be able to serve in the Senate alongside great Americans—the Presi-dent pro tempore, the Senator from Utah, and the Senator from Arizona, J
OHN MCCAIN, who have served this 
country for decades—decades—with honor and distinction, and, as we saw in their remarks just a few minutes ago, with wisdom from experience and conviction. 
We took two important votes today. 
One, as Senator M
CCAINwas talking 
about, was the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, very important pro-life legislation. I agree with what the Senator from Arizona said about that very important bill and commend the Presiding Officer for his leadership throughout the country. 
We also voted on the Defense appro-
priations bill today, another important bill. I am not sure it is going to get a lot of press, but I wish to talk about what is going on there because it is ac-tually very important for the Amer-
ican people to really have a sense of what is happening. We saw in the media, we see all over Washington and 
on TV this talk concerning a govern-ment shutdown. I think a lot of people have concerns about it. Let me talk about that in the context of the bill we voted on today, which, unfortunately, was filibustered by our colleagues on the other side of the aisle. 
A lot of us who are new here in the 
Senate—the Presiding Officer, my col-league from North Carolina—ran on the issue of a dysfunctional Senate, where the most basic function of gov-ernment was not happening. Let me give one critical example. We weren’t passing a budget, we weren’t funding government, and we weren’t doing reg-ular order in terms of appropriations bills. So many of us ran to say: Enough, we are going to change things here. With all due respect to my col-leagues on the other side of the aisle, they neglected this function—no budg-et, no appropriations bills—for years. The most basic function of government was not happening in the Senate. 
So many of us campaigned to change 
that—to work hard to change that—be-cause we knew that is what the Amer-ican people wanted. And we have done it. We are starting to do it. For exam-ple, we passed the budget resolution. 
If we look at the 10 years out of our 
budget versus the 10 years out of the President’s budget, we cut $5 to $7 tril-lion in terms of the President’s waste-ful spending. That is serious. We did that. We passed the budget resolution. We debated it here for a number of weeks, not days. The other side of the aisle hadn’t done that for years. 
When I went back home and said we 
did that, a lot of people in Alaska said: Well, big deal, my household passes a budget every year. My business passes a budget every year. The State of Alas-ka passes a budget every year. 
But it is a big deal because we hadn’t 
done it here. But now we are doing it because that is what we committed to do. 
So that is one step: We passed a 
budget. Then the Members of this body, working hard, particularly through the Appropriations Committee, passed 12 appropriations bills—9 of which passed out of the committee with very, very strong bipartisan votes—to fund the government. So far so good—that is what we are supposed to be doing here. We are back to work, back to regular order. 
One of these bills was the Defense ap-
propriation bill. What does that mean? It is kind of a wonky term. That is the bill that funds our military, that funds our national defense, that funds the sergeant in the Marine Corps and the Army—a really important bill. It passed out of the committee with a very strong bipartisan vote of 27 to 3. We almost can’t get any more bipar-tisan than that, 27 to 3. Virtually ev-erybody, Democrats and Republicans, voted for that because they know how important it is. So what happened today? We took 
the next step in the regular order proc-ess as we promised the American peo-ple to fund our government by bringing forward that bill. At 27 to 3, it should be no problem passing it in the Senate. Look at how many Democrats voted for that bill. So we wanted to move for-ward on that bill. We all know how critical that bill is—probably one of the most critical appropriations bills we have because it is funding the de-fense of our Nation and the brave men and women who serve our Nation. 
So what happened in the vote today? 
Well, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle decided: No, we are going to filibuster that. I know we voted 27 to 3 to move it out of committee, but now we are going to filibuster that. 
In fact, according to the leader on 
the other side of the aisle, the Demo-crats are saying they are going to fili-buster all 12 appropriations bills—all 12 of them. 
Let me repeat. Here is what is hap-
pening. We passed the budget. We passed, for the most part, very bipar-tisan appropriations bills. Let me read a few of them: Agriculture, 28 to 2, out of committee; Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies Appro-priations Subcommittee, 27 to 3; De-fense, 27 to 3; Energy and Water, 26 to 4; State and Foreign Operations, 27 to 3. 
This is a list of very bipartisan work 
by the Senate in the Appropriations Committee. I commend all the Mem-bers of this body who worked so hard on that. But now we hear that the other side is going to filibuster every single one of these. They did it today. That is actually the second time they did it with regard to the Defense appro-priations bill. They are going to do it again and again and again. 
It is my view that we should bring all 
12 of these bills to the Senate floor, like we did today. We are trying to move forward and fund this govern-ment. We are trying to get back to reg-ular order, the way the Senate used to work. It hadn’t worked like that for years, but now we are trying to do that. If the other side of the aisle wants to continually filibuster the funding of our government, let them stand up to the American people and do that. 
For example, I think we should bring 
up the Military Construction and Vet-erans Affairs appropriations bill that passed out of committee 21 to 9. It is very important for the country. Let’s bring it up. Let’s have a vote on it. If they want to filibuster that, I think they will have to explain why they are not supporting veterans. 
This will make one thing clear, 
though. In all the talk we hear in the media every day about Republicans wanting to shut down the government, I think it is pretty clear when we look at what is happening here with the fili-bustering of all the appropriations bills that there is another side to this story. There is another side to this story. The

defunding of the government—of our 
troops, as we saw today—is happening because of the filibuster. 
It is my hope that our friends in the 
media, who love to talk about this story, are going to look a little bit more deeply—look at these votes today, look at the budget, look at what the Appropriations Committee has been doing—and tell the real story. There are people very focused on stop-ping the funding of the government. We saw it today. It is not the majority party in the Senate.

PAIN-CAPABLE UNBORN CHILD PROTECTION BILL  
Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, I thank 
my colleague from the great State of Alaska for his comments. I wish to be associated with those comments. I also thank him not only for his service in the Senate but for his service in the Marines. 
I stand here today heartbroken over 
the failure to advance a bill that would protect the lives of unborn babies—ba-bies who are old enough, who, with proper care, can survive when born at this age. 
Many of my colleagues have spoken 
regarding all that we know about the science of fetal development—how un-born babies feel pain, when they feel pain, the related neurological data, and so on. Others will tell us that the United States is out of step with the overwhelming majority of other na-tions on this policy. Others will show poll numbers that demonstrate that an overwhelming majority of Americans, especially women, think this policy is a good policy—the policy that was voted down in this Chamber today. 
But we don’t need to know all that to 
know what is right and what is wrong. We know what is right. Any of us who have ever watched our wife’s belly grow, as I did with the miracle of my son and daughter; any of us who have ever experienced the excitement before learning the results of a prenatal test; any of us who have seen an ultrasound or attended a baby shower, we all know. We know because of the hun-dreds and thousands of friends, family, neighbors, and coworkers whose own baby stories we have watched over our lives. The stories of successful deliv-eries, the complications, the joys, the tragedies, and all of these stories—the beautiful stories and the bittersweet stories—have taught us the truth about the unborn. We all know. We don’t need to be scientists to understand what the science can tell us. 
So I wish to tell some stories that il-
lustrate what this bill, which was voted down today in this Chamber, is about. 
I want to start with Samuel. As early 
as 1999, we were doing fetal surgeries here in the United States. Samuel’s parents, Julie and Alex, were given the terrible news that their unborn son had permanent nerve damage from an open-ing in his spine due to spina bifida. Doctors said that half of all babies 
with spina bifida were aborted, but Julie and Alex chose a different path for Samuel. This was at 21 weeks. Sam-uel was operated on in utero. Today he is all grown up. Samuel said that he be-lieves God sent him to Earth to help stop abortion. 
Then there is Elijah. When April Leffingwell’s ultrasound 
at 20 weeks revealed a life-threatening tumor growing in Elijah’s left lung, she knew his life was in grave danger. Thankfully, this fateful diagnosis was not the end of the story. Instead, Eli-jah’s life was saved by an innovative fetal surgery performed at just 25 weeks. During the surgery, 3 years ago, 5-month-old baby Elijah was given an-esthesia to protect him from pain. He was then partially removed from his mother’s womb, and the life-threat-ening tumor the size of an orange was removed. Elijah’s primary surgeon at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia said that he would have died if the op-eration were not done before birth. Now, several years later, after a chal-lenging beginning, Elijah is a healthy and very active toddler. 
Here is another story, about Micah. Micah’s mom Danielle went into 
labor and delivered Micah when he was just 22 weeks old. This is little Micah shortly after delivery as shown in this picture. She was given the worst of news—that her son would not survive. But Micah received state-of-the-art care and spent the next 4 months in the neonatal intensive care unit, or NICU. Micah’s parents kept vigil at his side and watched all the developmental milestones, which should have been reached in utero, be reached in the ar-tificial environment in the NICU. And slowly, day by day, he made it. He thrived and is 3 years old. 
Micah and his family are here today 
at the Senate. I met them earlier today. He actually gave me this band that says ‘‘Miracles for Micah.’’ Surely my colleagues can see what Micah’s parents see; that their son was just as precious at 22 weeks as he is today at 3 years old. 
There are more stories. Some of us 
remember former Philadelphia Eagles player Vaughn Hebron. Vaughn and his wife Kim were given the news that their twins, 5 months old in utero, were facing what is called twin-trans-fusion—a life-threatening condition. Doctors said there was a 70-percent chance that one or both of the twins would die, but Vaughn and his wife chose to fight for their boys. They re-ceived state-of-the-art care and both boys are now healthy teenagers. 
All of these children—the Hebron 
twins, Micah, Elijah, Samuel—there is only one difference between them and the babies aborted, dismembered, and sold by Planned Parenthood; the only difference is that these children were wanted and welcomed. If they are wanted and welcome, we fight like mad to save them. We throw everything at them that science and medicine can possibly do. We save their lives and we 
create miracles every day. 
We need this bill to protect those 
poor babies who are unwanted and un-welcome. We don’t strip born children of their right to life and protection just because their parents don’t want them. We take care of them at taxpayer ex-pense. We try to help their parents sup-port them. We provide health care for them. If their parents will not or can’t raise them, we seek adoptive families for them. But if they are a few months, even a few days or a few minutes younger, our law denies them the op-portunity to grow, to learn, and to be-come the bright-eyed, world-changing children we all cherish and protect. 
They say a picture is worth a thou-
sand words. I think this one says it bet-ter than anything any of us will say on this Senate floor. This is a baby in utero around 20 weeks. There is simply no arguing that this is a baby. At this age, she is about 10 ounces, about 10 inches long—about the size of a big ba-nana. A baby this age is practicing swallowing for the first time. She is moving. Her skin is thickening up so it is starting to lose that translucent look. A good fraction of the babies who are delivered prematurely at this age survive. A few weeks later, almost all of them survive. 
The bill we voted on today would 
have protected babies from this age and older—when they can feel pain, when they look like humans in photo-graphs and sonograms, and when they are kicking around in their mama’s bellies. Although we didn’t advance this bill today, we must not give up. I am not giving up on my colleagues be-cause I believe justice can still win out. This bill must eventually pass. History will clothe us in disgrace if we fail to do so. The law should protect these children. Nobody put it better than the late great children’s author Dr. Seuss when he said: ‘‘A person’s a person, no matter how small.’’

CORPORATE CULTURE IN THE AUTOMOBILE  
INDUSTRY  
Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, Volks-
wagen has become part of the lexicon of the American economy, American culture. Volkswagen Beetles, at the time when I was growing up as a kid, were all a part of the America we know and love. Now we find out that Volks-wagen for years has been purposely de-ceiving the American public—for that matter, their customers around the world—on their diesel cars by decep-tively telling them what the mileage is on the cars. And oh, by the way, in the United States, because they were sup-posedly getting great mileage, there was a tax benefit to the purchasers of those vehicles. 
What in the world is happening to 
the American automobile industry and those foreign manufacturers that are selling automobiles here to take ad-vantage of the American automobile-

consuming public? It is an outrage that 
VW would take advantage of its con-sumers by purposely deceiving them on their mileage on diesel vehicles. 
First there was General Motors. Over 
100 people died as a result of a defective 
ignition switch that General Motors did not tell us about, and in the process just recently—last week—announced a fine of $900 million. Where are our U.S. regulatory agencies? What is the Obama administration doing about this in its regulatory agencies? Why are they not dropping the hammer on cor-porations and corporate executives that are purposely deceiving the Amer-ican people about faulty automobile products that cause the loss of lives and property? It was General Motors. Then it was Takata airbags, which are in a lot of automobiles but especially in Hondas and Toyotas. We know that a number of people have lost their lives, a number of people have been maimed, and they are driving around with an airbag in the middle of the steering wheel—which now there have been millions and millions of recalls— and in the middle of that steering wheel is an explosive grenade because it hasn’t been replaced. 
Today, Volkswagen admitted, over 
the course of the last half dozen years, that they have deceived people on their diesel vehicles by deceptively telling them what the gas mileage was. Has the corporate culture in what is an automobile society shrunk so low that we can’t be upfront when our products are defective or when we are trying to gain competitive advantage? I lay this not only on the corporate culture, I lay it at the feet of the U.S. regulatory agencies that ought to be doing their job and ought to be doing it in a force-ful way. Then there ought to be some prosecutions, and corporate executives who knew this and have done it ought to be going to jail. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-

CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM  
Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, in the 
coming days we know that we are going to have an extraordinary visit. This is a historic occasion. We are going to gather both Houses of Con-gress to hear from Pope Francis. Dur-ing his time in the United States, Pope Francis has chosen to do something that I think is extraordinary—to visit with the imprisoned. 
In his address here, he may or may 
not discuss the American criminal jus-tice system, but this visit alone, which speaks to something deep within the Catholic faith, deep within the Chris-tian religion, reflected in Matthew 25: ‘‘I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me.’’ This step by the Pope, to me, is an extraordinary accomplishment in bringing a further highlight to the challenges we have in the United States with our criminal justice sys-tem. The Pope has predicated his time as 
Pope on an ideal of mercy. His motto, ‘‘miserando atque eligendo,’’ which translates to ‘‘to be shown mercy and be chosen,’’ to me is extraordinary. I actually believe the Pope and what he is doing resonates not just in a reli-gious sense with the Christian faith but in the American sense with our shared collective values. 
I have taken the time to speak on the 
Senate floor on numerous occasions about our criminal justice system from many perspectives, but on this occa-sion, I would like to talk about those moral values which do not divide us as a nation but unite us. Those are values deep within the core of our country, part of our heritage, part of our songs, our pledges, and our words. 
We know the criminal justice system 
as it stands right now has many issues. If it was just analyzed on an economic angle, it would be enough to show how this criminal justice system is out of step with who we are as a people. We know that right now we in America are imprisoning more people than anybody else on the globe. We are the ‘‘incarcer-ation nation’’ when it comes to com-paring ourselves with other global na-tions. We are about 5 percent of the global population but 25 percent of the global prison population. One out of every four people on the planet Earth who are incarcerated are in the United States of America. The cost of that, from a fiscal perspective, is incredible. 
We spend over a quarter of a trillion 
dollars every single year on our crimi-nal justice system, a significant cost to American taxpayers. It is estimated that between 1980 and 2004, we would have had 20 percent less poverty in America if not for mass incarceration. Think about that for a second—the costs of poverty on our productivity. We know that only about 9 percent of children who are poor are going to go to college. There are significant costs associated with poverty, both fiscal and moral. The poverty rate would be 20 percent lower if we had incarcer-ation rates at the same levels as our industrial peers. 
At a time that our roads and our 
bridges are crumbling, as we as a na-tion have seen ourselves having gone from having the best infrastructure on the globe to now being a nation with an infrastructure that is not even ranked in the top 10 globally, at a time that we have seen investment go down as a percentage of our GDP, one thing we have seen go up is our investment in the prison infrastructure. 
We know that between 1990 and 2005, 
a new prison opened in the United States every 10 days. We have seen our prison population on a Federal level go up over the last 30 years about 800 per-cent. Looking at this from the fiscal perspective, we know we are digging a hole for ourselves—self-inflicted eco-nomic wounds that are just unneces-sary for a nation of free people. Take for example a report from the Center for Economic and Policy Research. They concluded that in the year 2008 
alone, ex-offender unemployment losses to our economy were the equiva-lent of 1.5 to 1.7 million workers or $57 billion to $65 billion annually. In other words, when our folks come out of pris-on, as most do, they find it so hard to reintegrate into our economy. They find it hard to start jobs as there are bars to employment, finding it hard to start businesses as there are bars to business licenses. And that loss to our economy is the equivalent of about 1.6 million workers or $57 billion to $65 bil-lion annually. 
This reality, the fiscal reality 
alone—before we even talk about our values as a country, before we even talk about our morals—should be enough for us to find greater urgency about the need to reform our criminal justice system, especially because States in America are beginning to show that you can save taxpayer dol-lars by reducing incarceration levels and empowering people to succeed while simultaneously lowering the crime rate. This alone should be enough to show that we have a broken criminal justice system that violates the ideals of economic prudence and fiscal conservatism. We are digging an economic hole for ourselves. 
While the Pope will talk to us with a 
moral force during his visit, it is also important to understand that as a moral nation, the values we have put forth into the world are being violated by our criminal justice system as well. 
This body has been a body that has 
spoken with clarity on numerous moral issues—from the Civil Rights Act to the Fair Housing Act—but now we are seeing that we are failing to do what is necessary when it comes to living up to those powerful words of equal justice under the law. It is inscribed on the Supreme Court just hundreds of yards from where I am standing right now. 
We now know that there is no dif-
ference in drug usage and selling rates between African Americans, Whites, and Latinos. Yet our criminal justice system is incarcerating minorities in this country well disproportionate to their numbers in those drug crimes. 
Even at a time when we have had our 
last three Presidents admit to using drugs—the last two admitted to vio-lating the drug laws—we still have a nation in which we are treating certain people differently. 
Take, for example, that we now know 
that African Americans and Whites have no difference for selling and using drugs, but Blacks are about 3.7 times more likely to be arrested for a mari-juana related crime. Take, for example, that African Americans and Whites are arrested for the same crimes, and Blacks are given sentences that are about 20 percent longer than Whites for those similar crimes. African Ameri-cans are about 21 percent more likely to receive a mandatory minimum than Whites facing similar charges. 
This disproportionate experience 
under the law has created harrowing

results within our Nation. There are 
more African Americans in jail, prison or under State or Federal supervision today than there were African Ameri-cans enslaved in 1850. 
Even though African Americans 
make up 14.7 percent of the population in my State of New Jersey, they make up 61 percent of the total correctional population. One in three African-Amer-ican men born in 2001 will go to prison during their lifetime. These numbers are astonishing, and in many ways they are being fueled by a criminal jus-tice system that, from arrests to sen-tencing, is treating African Americans harsher than their White peers. This value of equal justice under the law is not being fulfilled. 
Latinos face the same challenges. Na-
tive Americans are also grossly over-represented in our criminal justice sys-tem, with incarceration rates that are 38 percent higher than the national av-erage. There is no difference in pro-clivity for drug crimes among people of color, but we have a system that actu-ally punishes those who are of color in different ways. We need to begin, as a Congress and a nation, to find ways to have drug laws that make sense. The explosion of incarcerations in this country was fueled by the war on drugs, and we know that certain com-munities are facing the harsh impact of that enforcement in ways that other communities are not. 
We need to reform our harsh manda-
tory minimum policies. For too long we have taken away judicial discretion and tied the hands of sentencing ex-perts who can and should weigh other factors when it comes to making sen-tencing decisions. We need to now avoid what Congress intended—giving these harsh sentences to people who are not drug kingpins or large players but often low-level offenders. 
This idea of equal opportunity as 
well is something that is of value and is deep within our system. Unfortu-nately, the trends we see in our crimi-nal justice system aren’t limited to adults and the treatment under the law, but they are also showing that our kids as well do not always face equal pathways to opportunity. Today we know that the number of children who are born to people who are incarcerated or have an incarcerated parent is grow-ing astonishingly. Right now, 1 in 28 children is growing up with a parent in prison, and 1 in 9 African-American kids, as a result of this mass incarcer-ation disproportionately hitting minor-ity communities, is growing up with a parent behind bars. These kids often struggle more in school, have families who are often poorer, and have limited opportunities of success. 
Over half of imprisoned parents were 
the primary earners for their children prior to their incarceration, and a child with an incarcerated father is more likely to be suspended from school than a peer without an incarcerated fa-ther—23 percent compared to 4 percent. These are serious gulfs in opportunity being created by a broken criminal jus-
tice system. The gulfs of opportunity between young people based on race start young and actually only grow with time. 
For too many children, zero-toler-
ance discipline policies in schools across America serve as a gateway into the criminal justice system and a life-time of devastating collateral con-sequences. And just as in the American criminal justice system, too many young people of color in America are falling into the trap of that school-to- prison pipeline. 
According to the U.S. Department of 
Education’s Office of Civil Rights in March 2014, Black students were sus-pended at a rate three times greater than White students. On average, 5 per-cent of White students are suspended compared to 16 percent of Black stu-dents. Students who have been sus-pended or expelled as a part of their school’s disciplinary policy are 3 times as likely to become involved in the ju-venile justice system within the next year. There is evidence showing that kids of different races face the harsh-ness of those policies in different ways. In other words, minority students are often treated harshly while others see leniency. We need to begin to enact commonsense policies that provide for equal opportunity—those commonsense policies that don’t lead to suspension or involvement with police officers when in the past the infraction typi-cally would have been dealt with the school internally. We need to find a system where a child’s one mistake does not become a lifetime sentence, where children are empowered to suc-ceed and not fear a retribution that de-stabilizes their lives. 
We also know that it is important 
that we begin to think: Are we a nation of second chances? Are we a nation where words such as redemption and mercy have meaning? Are we a nation that can live up to these ideals where just because you fall down and stumble and make a mistake, you cannot be someone who can still stand up again and make your way? 
We know that every single year ap-
proximately 600,000 Americans finish their prison sentences after paying their debt to society and reenter their communities. They often find them-selves unable to work, to vote, to get back to school or to get a loan. The collateral consequences are extraor-dinary. 
The American Bar Association has 
identified over 46,000 collateral con-sequences that impact people with criminal records. About 60 to 70 per-cent of them are employment-related. In other words, even though we are saying to people who have paid their debt that they now need to get back to work, we are actually putting up bars which prevent them from doing so. They are finding it hard to get a job, get a business license, get a loan, or get a Pell grant, and if they fall and stumble, they often find it hard to even get food stamps or get the social safety 
net that often keeps people from abject desperation. These realities place too many roadblocks in the way of people coming home. 
During Pope Francis’s visits to pris-
ons, he is said to have asked himself: Why did God allow that I should not be here? But for the grace of God. 
In advance of his visit, I believe we 
should be asking ourselves: What do these ideals of mercy and redemption mean to us—this idea that when we see people who are broken by society, we should understand that we should be investing in their success? It actually not only makes moral sense to do so, but it makes sense to do so because we will reap the economic benefit. 
If you take, for example, Americans 
who are suffering from addiction, we now know that $1 invested in people with addiction to get treatment pro-duces a benefit in reducing interactions with the police and incarceration by $4 to $7. Yet the overwhelming majority of people with drug addictions do not get treatment. Not only is that fiscally unsound, but that makes no sense in the ideals of our morals as a nation, that we should help people who are bro-ken by disease. 
This is the point we have come to as 
a nation, where we know that doing the morally right thing actually helps to save the dollars of our taxpayers so that we can keep that in our own pock-ets or invest them in areas that we so desperately need. 
Take, for example, a simple thing 
that companies around this country, such as Bed Bath & Beyond and Starbucks, are doing but we don’t do in the Federal Government—this com-monsense idea that those who have paid their debt will be given a level playing field and a fair shot to get a job to prove that they are worthy of work. Some people call this Ban the Box, something that 18 States have done. But here in the Federal Govern-ment, we still make people—right at the point of application—check the box and say that they have been formally incarcerated, which means, for many Americans, that it gives them 50 to 60 percent less chance of even getting an interview or getting an opportunity to demonstrate their worth and make their case. 
We know that simple things such as 
moving that time of disclosure of a pre-vious criminal conviction to later in the process could elevate the chances of getting more people to work. And when they get to work, they begin to be there for their families, their kids, our economy, and they become produc-tive, as opposed to what we have now, which over time is a recidivism rate— the rate at which people go back to prison—that is upwards of 75 percent, costing us again billions of dollars as taxpayers. 
This system is broken. It makes no 
economic sense, but more importantly, it violates our ideals as a nation of equal justice under the law, the ideal of

having a second chance in our country, 
and the ideal of equal opportunity for all. 
We must now embrace the urgency of 
the moment. To have a wasteful sys-tem that is broken, that further harms and injures people with illnesses— whether it be mental health disorder or an addiction—that aggravates them with practices such as putting children in solitary confinement—all of these things violate our principals as a na-tion, and it is time for us to join to-gether and embrace change. 
I feel honored that right now in this 
country there is an emerging bipar-tisan and nonpartisan coalition around criminal justice reform. We see people from all across the political perspec-tive approaching it from different per-spectives—from Christian Evangelicals to fiscal conservatives to civil libertar-ians to civil rights activists—all begin-ning to say the system is morally bankrupt. It is bankrupting States and our Nation. It is a violation of who we are as a country, and it just makes no sense. 
It was James Baldwin who once said: 
There is never time in the future in which 
we will work out our salvation. The chal-lenge is in the moment; the time is always now. 
With this visit from the Pope and his 
further spotlighting our criminal jus-tice system, let us find that moral ur-gency in our Nation. Let us find the grit that we have shown in the past for overcoming injustice. Let us join to-gether and begin with even more ur-gency to do the hard work of cor-recting the ills within our criminal jus-tice system, of fixing what is broken, and making right in America that which we hold so dear—that we are a nation indeed with liberty and justice for all. 
I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
Democratic leader. 
Mr. REID. Mr. President, I know my 
friend, the distinguished Senator from Vermont, has been waiting, and so I will be very quick with the statement that I am going to give. 
REMEMBERING JIM SANTINI  
Mr. President, today Nevada lost a 
historic figure. This morning former U.S. Congressman Jim Santini of Ne-vada passed away. He was a remark-ably good person—a tremendous person who understood Nevada so well. 
He was a native Nevadan, born in 
Reno. He came from a real heritage that caused him to love his State of Nevada. His grandfather, Walter E. Clark, was the longest serving presi-dent at the University of Nevada. His uncle is a famous writer—a really cele-brated author—Walter Van Tillburg Clark. It has been a long time, but what a great writer. His most famous work was ‘‘The Ox-Bow Incident.’’ I read it again a few years ago. It was made into a movie, which I watched again. It was considered by most to be the most—actually, the first modern Western novel. So Jim Santini breathed what Ne-
vada was all about. He knew the State extremely well. He graduated from the University of Nevada—the same school where his grandfather was the presi-dent. He became close friends with former Senator Richard Bryan of Ne-vada, a two-term Governor and a strik-ing figure in his own right. They were inseparable friends. They were in col-lege together. They went to the same law school—Hastings Law School in San Francisco. 
Jim graduated from law school in 
1962. He immediately decided he would serve his country, and for 3 years he served in the U.S. Army. His service to his State and country spans many dec-ades. 
His good friend Richard Bryan con-
vinced him that he should move from Reno. The growth in the State was in the southern part of the State, the Las Vegas area. Jim—in some respects re-luctantly—moved from his roots to southern Nevada, where he excelled. He worked as a deputy district attorney. After the first public defender in the State of Nevada decided to run for pub-lic office, he was replaced—that is Richard Bryan, the first public de-fender in Clark County—he was re-placed with his good friend Jim Santini, who became a public defender. 
It was a short time thereafter that he 
was elected justice of the peace of Las Vegas. During this period of time, the role of the justice of the peace changed. It became more of a judicial officer rather than someone who be-came fabulously wealthy by marrying hundreds and hundreds of people. That is the way it used to be. He did a very good job as justice of the peace. He was so impressive that the Governor of the State of Nevada, Mike O’Callaghan, ap-pointed him to serve as a Nevada dis-trict court judge representing Clark County. 
In 1972 Jim ran for Nevada’s at-large 
congressional seat. From 1864, when Nevada became a State, until 1982, Ne-vada only had one Congressman, one Member of Congress, and it was an at- large seat. And when Jim ran for that in 1972, he ran against Republican in-cumbent David Towell, who just 2 years before was in a race with Con-gressman Walter S. Baring, who served in Congress for some 22 years rep-resenting Nevada’s at-large congres-sional seat and who was defeated in the primary. But David Towell came from nowhere and beat the Democrat in that case. Santini came right back, and David Towell was a one-term Congress-man. 
Jim represented the State of Nevada 
in Congress very honorably for four terms. He was well respected, well re-garded, and very popular in the State of Nevada. However, in 1982 Jim de-cided to run for the Senate, and he was not successful. In 1986 he ran for the Senate again. I was his opponent. It was a relatively close race, but when that race was over, it was over. I knew Jim before he and I became opponents. We worked together on many different 
projects. We never had a cross word. To this day we never had a cross word. 
Jim became a counsel—a lawyer—and 
a lobbyist for America’s tourism and travel industry. He worked to bring tourists to the United States and to the State of Nevada, and he did it very admirably and very well. 
Jim Santini had a wonderful wife, 
Ann Santini. She has quite a career in her own right. She is the director of international affairs for the LDS Church here in Washington, DC. They have four children: Lisa, Lori, Mark, and J.D. They have 11 grandchildren. 
Before leaving Jim Santini, we have 
to speak about his uniqueness. Here is a man who had—there may be someone who has a better arrowhead collection than Jim Santini; I just don’t know who it would be. He spent many dec-ades—a lot of the time in Nevada but around the country—collecting arrow-heads. He had a great collection of ar-rowheads. He also collected Indian bas-kets, and in Nevada we had probably the most famous basket weaver in the history of the country, a woman by the name of Dat So La Lee. She is really a very famous woman. Many of her bas-kets are worth over $1 million. She made baskets this big—woven, of course, by hand—and baskets this large. Jim collected baskets. I don’t know how many he wound up having of Dat So La Lee’s, but I am sure he had some. 
It is with a great deal of sadness that 
I report to my friends in Nevada and the friends Jim had here in Washington that Jim passed away this morning. I said that earlier. I will miss him. He and I exchanged letters right after the first of the year, right after I got hurt, injured my eye. He always was a kind, gracious man, and I will miss him very much, as will everyone in Nevada and his friends here in Washington.

PAPAL VISIT  
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I am 
delighted that Pope Francis will be ad-dressing a joint session of Congress on Thursday. 
The Pope has played, in my view, an 
extraordinary role since he assumed his position in speaking out with cour-age and brilliance about some of the most important issues facing our world. From the moment he was elect-ed, he immediately let it be known that he would be a different kind of Pope, a different kind of religious lead-er. In choosing his Papal name— Francis—he said: 
Francis of Assisi. For me, he is the man of 
poverty, the man of peace, the man who loves and protects creation. 
What I want to do in a short period of 
time is read some of the very profound and important statements Pope Francis has made over the last several years. They are incisive, they are cou-rageous, and they speak to a world in trouble that needs the kind of leader-ship that he is providing.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6881 September 22, 2015 
Let me quote from a number of the 
statements he has made. 
Quote: 
While the income of a minority is increas-
ing exponentially, that of the majority is crumbling. This imbalance results from ideologies which uphold the absolute auton-omy of markets and financial speculation, and thus deny the right of control to States, which are themselves charged with providing for the common good. 
Obviously, he is not talking about 
the United States; he is talking about the global economy. But certainly in our country, when he talks about the income of the minority increasing ex-ponentially and that of the majority crumbling, he is, of course, right. We have right now in our country the top one-tenth of 1 percent owning almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 per-cent. We have about 58 percent of all new income being created now going to the top 1 percent. In the last several years, we have seen the 14 wealthiest people in America increase their wealth by $156 billion, and that in-crease in wealth is more wealth than is owned by the bottom 40 percent of the American people. 
As the Pope points out, this is not by 
any means just an American issue; this is a global issue. We are moving toward a period where very shortly the top 1 percent of the people on the planet will own more wealth than the bottom 99 percent. To me, that is immoral, that is wrong, that is unsustainable, and I am glad the Pope has raised that issue. 
He talks about another issue which is 
even more profound. It is one thing to talk about income and wealth inequal-ity, and it is another thing to talk about poverty. 
Here, he says: 
We have created new idols. The worship of 
the golden calf of old has found a new and heartless image in the cult of money and the dictatorship of an economy which is faceless and lacking any truly humane goal. 
‘‘The worship of the golden calf of old 
has found a new and heartless image in the cult of money.’’ What does that mean? Well, I take it to mean that we are living in a society which turns its back on people who work hard, decent people, people who are good parents, but yet we worship those people who for whatever reason—sometimes hon-estly and with creativity, sometimes dishonestly and illegally—have become millionaires and billionaires. Those are the people we worship. The more money they make, the more they get worshipped. I think the Pope is right in saying that is not something we should be doing. 
In another statement, which is cer-
tainly relevant for a lot of the discus-sions we have here on the floor of the Senate, he said: 
In this context, some people continue to 
defend trickle-down theories which assume that economic growth, encouraged by a free market, will inevitably succeed in bringing about greater justice and inclusiveness in the world. This opinion, which has never been confirmed by the facts, expresses a crude and naive trust in the goodness of those wielding economic power and in the 
sacralized workings of the prevailing eco-nomic system. 
What is he talking about? He is talk-
ing about a lot of what has gone on here in this country for many decades. There is a theory, which the Pope is right in saying has never been con-firmed by the facts—quite the con-trary—that if we give huge tax breaks to billionaires and large corporations, somehow that money will trickle down to the middle class and working class. Well, that theory has not proved to be true. Under trickle-down economics, the rich get richer and virtually every-body else gets poorer. I think the Pope is quite right in making that point. 
Let me again quote the Pope. This is 
what he said: 
Man is not in charge today, money is in 
charge. Money rules. 
Money rules. Well, 5 years ago the 
U.S. Supreme Court by a 5-to-4 decision passed the disastrous Citizens United decision which basically said to the wealthiest people in this country: You already own much of the economy; now we are going to give you the oppor-tunity to buy the United States Gov-ernment. And that is exactly what they are now attempting to do. Money rules. You have one family—the Koch broth-ers—who will spend $900 million in this election cycle to elect candidates who will protect the wealthy and powerful. That is more money than will be spent by either the Democratic or Repub-lican Party. When one family is spend-ing more money than either of the two major political parties, I think it is an example of what the Pope is talking about when he says ‘‘money rules.’’ 
Money does rule, and that is why, in 
my view, we have to overturn Citizens United and move to the public funding of elections—so the wealthy and the powerful will not be able to buy elec-tions. 
He also said something very inter-
esting about the media. This is what he said: 
These things become the norm: that some 
homeless people die of cold on the streets is not news. In contrast, a ten point drop on the stock markets of some cities is a trag-edy. 
Well, what is news? Is he right? We 
talk about the stock market going up, the stock market going up. It is big news. The 45 million Americans living in poverty—I don’t hear much discus-sion about that. There are thousands of people dying every single year because they don’t have health insurance and can’t get to a doctor when they need to. That ain’t big news—not big news at all. I think it is an interesting point about what constitutes news, and I think the Pope makes a very good point in that regard. 
Let me give another quote: 
It is a well-known fact that current levels 
of production are sufficient, yet millions of people are still suffering and dying of starva-tion. This, dear friends, is truly scandalous. 
I think what the Pope is talking 
about is that in a world where we have enormous productive capability—in-
dustrial, agricultural—we have a situa-tion where children die of diseases that are preventable all over the world, where people go hungry all over the world. Yet, as he says, our current lev-els of production are sufficient. We are producing enough to feed the hungry, to clothe the naked, to provide what people need, and yet we have an econ-omy which works day after day to make billionaires richer and turns its back on desperate people all over the world. 
Let me end with this quote: 
Today everything comes under the laws of 
competition and the survival of the fittest, where the powerful feed upon the powerless. As a consequence, masses of people find themselves excluded and marginalized: with-out work, without possibilities, without any means of escape. 
That is certainly true in the United 
States. It is certainly truer all over the world. We are living in a world of the survival of the fittest. If you are poor, if you are unemployed, if you are hun-gry, government turns its back on you. But if you are rich, if you are powerful, if you can make campaign contribu-tions of hundreds of millions of dollars, we love you, we welcome you, and we need you more and more. 
I think during this week where we 
welcome the Pope to Washington, DC, I would hope that some of my colleagues would examine the very profound les-sons he is teaching people all over this world. 
With that, Mr. President, I yield the 
floor.

Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I rise to 
speak about a very important issue. It is a fundamental constitutional issue for this body and part of our duty in the Senate and the Congress; that is, to ensure next week the funding for the government which expires at the end of the month. With only 1 week until the current government funding runs out, it is our responsibility to work to-gether to make sure that the govern-ment keeps running, that we do not disrupt people’s lives, that we do not end up spending more money because we shut the government down to re-open it, and that we provide certainty with all of the challenges we face at home and, of course, the threats we face abroad. 
An issue has come up that is a very 
important issue, and that is an organi-zation called Planned Parenthood and holding Planned Parenthood account-able in the wake of deeply disturbing videos that discuss the appalling prac-tice of harvesting the organs and body parts of unborn babies.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6882 September 22, 2015 
Like Americans across all political 
spectrums, I was just sick—sick to see the contents of recent videos that have been disclosed that show a callous dis-regard by officials at Planned Parent-hood for the dignity of human life. These videos have shocked the con-science of people across our country be-cause this organization does receive taxpayer funding. I understand why we have had an important debate in this body about redirecting this funding be-cause of Planned Parenthood’s actions and fully investigating what was re-vealed in these disturbing videos that show the practice of the harvesting of organs and body parts of unborn babies. 
So I support the efforts of the Judici-
ary Committee to investigate these disturbing videos. I also do not believe it is appropriate that taxpayer funds should be used to fund a private organi-zation that performs hundreds of thou-sands of abortions each year and that engages in the horrific practices that were shown in these videos. 
That is why last month I joined a bi-
partisan majority of Senators in voting to redirect Federal funding from Planned Parenthood to community health centers that provide women’s health services, including mammo-grams, cancer screenings, and contra-ceptives. In New Hampshire there are more than 30 community health cen-ters, compared to 5 Planned Parent-hood clinics. 
But when we had this debate and vote 
on the Senate floor, we received only 53 votes in favor of redirecting this money from Planned Parenthood to community health centers which pro-vide women’s health services, falling well short of the 60-vote threshold re-quired to advance this legislation in the Senate. Yet despite already having had a vote on this, which failed the 60- vote threshold in the Senate, there are some that are pushing to attach this issue to the funding of the government, even though when we had the vote here, we did not have the votes to get it passed in the Senate, and even though the President himself has ex-plicitly said he would veto any bill that prohibits funding for Planned Par-enthood or redirects that funding to community health centers. 
In fact, the President is so dug in on 
funding for Planned Parenthood that he is prepared to let the government shut down over it. And those who are pushing the strategy, saying we should go forward with it anyway—they have not explained how we would obtain 67 votes in the Senate. 
When we had the vote on it, we only 
got 53, not even enough to advance the legislation in the Senate, which re-quires 60. The President certainly knows that we do not have 67 votes in the Senate to override his veto. Never-theless, those who are pushing the strategy to attach this to the govern-ment funding bill—this issue of re-directing the funding—also know that there are not 60 votes in the Senate, never mind 67 to override a Presi-dential veto. So the result is that if we 
passed the bill, even if we could get the 60 votes, the President is sure to veto it, and the 67 votes are not there to override his veto. 
In the end, we are heading for an im-
minent government shutdown if this is not resolved. Everyone who looks at this issue knows the reality of where the votes lie. In fact, those on my side 
of the aisle who have been pushing the strategy of pass the bill, send it to the President for his veto, I have asked them the question: Let’s assume we get the 60 votes to do that; first of all, how do we get those 60 votes? I have not re-ceived an answer to that question. Then I have asked the next question: Even if we could get those 60 votes to pass it out of the Senate and to send this to the President’s desk with a gov-ernment funding bill that redirects the money to Planned Parenthood over his opposition and he vetoes it, where do the 67 votes come from? I have not re-ceived an answer to that. 
So I am here on the floor today to 
say: I am tired of the political games. I am tired of the President’s game on this, that he is so dug in on this issue that he would be willing to let the gov-ernment shut down. I am tired of the people on my side of the aisle who are pushing this strategy even though they know they do not have the votes to have it pass the Senate, and they cer-tainly don’t have the votes to override a Presidential veto, so, therefore, they cannot answer the question: What is the end game for success here, even if you feel as passionately about these issues as we all do? 
So here we are again with the polit-
ical posturing on both sides. I don’t want to play this game anymore. I think it is too important that we not relive the movie of where we were in 2013 when the government shut down because I asked the very same question then, when the issue was defunding ObamaCare. I asked the question: How does this end? How does it end success-fully to defund ObamaCare? How does it end without shutting down the gov-ernment? I never received an answer then, and I have not received an answer now from those who are pushing this strategy. 
We saw the movie in 2013. I do not 
think we should relive that movie. Let’s remember what happened. When you shut the government down and you reopen it, it actually costs us more money. So if you care about the fiscal state of the country, let’s not waste money shutting down the government with no results. You think about the economy and the disruption in people’s lives. I remember my constituents call-ing me on the phone, because I was an-swering my phones. I remember people who saved for years for a family vaca-tion to our national parks and could not participate in that family vacation and lost the money they had sunk into it for years in their savings for their big family vacation because people were pushing to keep the government shut down, even though they had no 
strategy for achieving a result on it. 
I remember the uncertainty and the 
hardship for working families and our military. Even though we keep our na-tional security piece open during a gov-ernment shutdown, there is so much uncertainty about whom that covers and whom it doesn’t. When we look at the threats we are facing around the world right now, we do not need uncer-tainty when it comes to those who keep us safe at home on the law en-forcement end, on our intel, on our military, and all the civilian workforce that supports them and makes sure they can do their job every single day. 
The bottom line is, in 2013 we did not 
get a result, the funding for ObamaCare continued, the government was shut down, it cost us more money and disruption. We never got an answer then for how that would end success-fully. Here we find ourselves again, the same group of people pushing the same strategy on the Planned Parenthood issue, saying we should shut the gov-ernment down again, even though they cannot answer the question: How do we 
get to 60 votes? How do we get to 67 votes so that you can actually achieve a result here? I think the answer is that they don’t know the answer, be-cause we all know where the votes are. It is not going to happen. 
So I am here on the floor because I 
feel strongly. I agree with the National Right to Life on this. In a recent op-ed, the National Right to Life rightly points out that pursuing this shutdown strategy could actually undermine ef-forts to hold Planned Parenthood ac-countable, primarily by shifting public attention in the political blame game that would result inevitably from the shutdown. The National Right to Life also cited a study by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, which found that the majority of Federal funds flowing to Planned Parenthood would not even be temporarily inter-rupted if the government shut down be-cause the funds flow from mandatory spending programs like Medicaid rath-er than the congressional funding proc-ess, which is the discretionary spend-ing piece impacted by what we will vote on regarding the continuing reso-lution. 
Again, this was the same issue that 
actually came up in 2013 when it came to the tactics of trying to defund ObamaCare without a strategy for suc-cess. Right now we are playing a game of chicken. It is a dangerous game. We already know as we stand here where the votes are and what it takes to keep the government open. Yet, as I under-stand it, we are going to be taking an-other vote on Thursday so we can show the proponents of those who are again seeking to attach the Planned Parent-hood redirecting-of-funding issue to the government funding bill that, guess what, we already know the answer to this. We don’t have the votes. We are not going to get to 60 in the Senate, never mind the 67 it would take to override a Presidential veto.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6883 September 22, 2015 
So we all know what it is going to 
take to keep the government open. I think we should have that vote now, instead of continuing to have the polit-ical show votes that show the people where we know the votes already are on this issue. That means a clean fund-ing bill now, so that we are not wasting time, so that we are not bringing our-selves closer to the brink of a shut-down. 
So in good conscience, while I fully 
support redirecting the money from Planned Parenthood to community health centers who serve women, I can-not in good conscience participate again in this process, one that would ensure we come closer to the brink of a shutdown, when I have not heard a strategy for success. 
I think the American people are owed 
an answer to the question: What is your strategy of success if you are threatening to shut down the govern-ment? I would ask the same of Presi-dent Obama: If this is such an impor-tant issue to you that you are willing also to participate in this exercise of threatening a shutdown, is it that im-portant to you given that the money can be redirected to community health centers that provide services to women? 
That said, it is time to quit the 
games on both sides of the aisle. I came here to solve problems. That means we need to address this issue now. We should have the vote on the clean fund-ing bill now. We should make sure we keep the government running, given the challenges we are facing at home and abroad, so that we do not have shutdown 2 and relive the movie we saw in 2013, and that was not a good one for the country. 
I hope we will take the vote right 
now instead of continuing to play po-litical games on both sides of the aisle while the clock ticks down. This is a very important issue for our country, and I am prepared right now to vote for a bill that will keep the government funded.

OIL EXPORT BAN  
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, 
last week a bipartisan majority of Sen-ators—Members of this body—voted to try to stop President Obama’s dan-gerous and desperate deal with Iran— that is right, dangerous and desperate. 
The President wants to give Iran re-
lief from the economic sanctions the world imposed. I believe President Obama traded away these sanctions too readily and he got too little in return. These sanctions included limits on the sale of Iranian oil. According to one es-
timate, Iran could soon begin to export as many as 1 million additional barrels of oil each and every day. I know the money Iran makes from these sales will go to shoring up its economy, and it will go to building up Iran’s mili-tary. Some of it will undoubtedly go to supporting global terrorists. That is what President Obama traded away. Iran will be allowed to sell its oil any-where in the world, yet American oil producers are largely prohibited from selling American oil anywhere in the world. Apparently, that is exactly the way the White House wants to keep things. 
There is legislation working its way 
through Congress right now to lift the ban on American crude oil exports. The Obama administration has said it doesn’t support the bill. There is bipar-tisan support of the bill but not this White House—oh no. They think Con-gress shouldn’t even get to decide. They think it should be up to Wash-ington bureaucrats in the Obama ad-ministration to make the decisions. The administration thinks they are the only ones who should be allowed to de-cide whether the oil export ban gets lifted. 
It was the Obama administration 
that let Iran off the hook by signing such a terrible deal. It is the Obama administration that now wants to lift the sanctions and give Iran access to more than $100 billion. Should the Obama administration be the one to decide whether Iran gets to sell its oil without American competition? Is that what the President wants? Why is the Obama administration so interested in making sure Iran’s economy gets back on its feet faster? 
The President ought to be focused on 
helping America’s economy, not Iran’s economy. Right now American pro-ducers export about 500,000 barrels of oil a day. Where does it go? It goes to Canada. Iran is exporting about 1 mil-lion barrels a day. But once President Obama lifts the sanctions, that number is going to jump to almost 2 million barrels a day—2 million barrels a day. So President Obama favors a situation where Iran will be allowed to export four times as much oil as America does—four times as much. That is what the President is in favor of. And Senate Democrats who voted to help the Presi-dent lift the sanctions want the same thing. That is what they say, 4 to 1— Iran over the United States. 
Republicans want something very 
different. If the export ban is lifted, U.S. energy producers could export an-other 1.6 million barrels a day. Our daily oil exports would jump from half a million barrels to about 2 million barrels. That is what we want, to lift the sanctions. At the same time, Re-publicans voted to keep the sanctions in place against Iran. So under Repub-lican plans, America would be export-ing twice as much oil as Iran. 
The Democrats vote four for Iran, 
one for the United States, and Repub-licans voted two for the United States, 
one for Iran. That is the difference be-tween what Washington Democrats want and what Senate Republicans want. 
The Brookings Institution looked at 
this in September of 2014. They came out with a report. They looked at a va-riety of different scenarios for how much oil America might export. They found that for every scenario they looked at, ‘‘there are positive gains for U.S. households,’’ with the United States being able to export more crude oil. The Government Accountability Office said the same thing last year. It said that ‘‘removing export restrictions is expected to increase the size of the economy’’—that is the U.S. economy— ‘‘with implications for employment, in-vestment, public revenue and trade.’’ 
Those are key for America. These studies and others predict that 
adding American crude oil to global supplies could ultimately reduce gaso-line prices right here at home. By how much, you ask? Well, one study esti-mated it would save American con-sumers a combined average of almost $6 billion per year. This study found the savings would help increase the U.S. economy by about $38 billion by 2020. New oil exports could support an additional 300,000 jobs by 2020. 
These are huge benefits for the Amer-
ican economy, for American families— all because we free up American energy and we allow it to compete in the world’s markets. 
There would also be benefits for 
America’s foreign policy. More oil would reduce prices worldwide. That means the other countries that export a lot of oil won’t be able to make as much money off of their own oil sales. They would have to compete with us. This includes Iran. It includes coun-tries such as Russia and Venezuela that use the wealth from their energy sales to pilot their own economies and not for the good. 
New oil exports would undercut the 
ability of those countries to do things that are not in America’s best interest. It would also help American allies around the world. Poland gets 96 per-cent of its oil from Russia. When they are negotiating to buy more oil, they would love—love—the opportunity and the option of American oil as an alter-native. Belgium gets 60 percent of its oil from Russia and Saudi Arabia. Japan gets 75 percent of its oil from Russia and the Middle East. All of these countries and many more around the world could benefit from U.S. oil being sold on the world market. 
Of course, another country that 
would really be helped is Israel. Presi-dent Obama’s reckless deal with Iran has put Israel in a much more dan-gerous situation. Even the White House seems to recognize this. The Obama ad-ministration says that it plans to offer Israel more military aid—aid to be used to bolster Israel’s defenses against Iran. But the administration should not stop at military aid; it should also

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6884 September 22, 2015 
offer Israel the opportunity to import 
American oil. Israel has trouble buying oil from many of its neighboring coun-tries because they do not recognize the State of Israel. That leaves places such as Russia and Iraqi Kurdistan as its largest suppliers of crude oil. 
If the Israelis had the opportunity to 
buy from American oil producers in-stead, that would be a big help in mak-ing sure their oil supply is stable and secure. It would also help repair some of the significant damage the Presi-dent’s Iran deal did to the relations be-tween our two countries. 
This should be an easy call. Ending 
the ban on U.S. oil exports would be good for American families, good for our national security, and good for our allies. The Obama administration should change course now. The Obama administration should work with Con-gress to end this ban on American en-ergy exports as quickly as possible. 
This past Saturday marked 7 years 
since a Canadian company filed its ap-plication to build the Keystone KL Pipeline—7 years. It has been buried in the bureaucratic limbo of the State De-partment ever since. That pipeline would provide American jobs just as more oil exports would. Americans should not have to wait another 7 years for Washington to lift the oil export ban and unleash the power of American energy.

CLIMATE CHANGE AND NONPROFIT ENERGY  
EFFICIENCY  
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, 
I rise today to talk about a critical issue that I think the Pope’s arrival today in Washington really highlights, and I am hopeful we will be addressing it in this Chamber. 
I wanted to join Senator W
HITEHOUSE  
yesterday. He has been an unwavering voice on the need for Congress to take legislative action to address climate change. He hit a milestone in May of this year by giving his 100th speech on the floor calling on his colleagues to act on climate change. He has also brought together a group of Senators to form a climate action task force, and I am proud to be a member of the group. 
I believe we need a strong energy 
agenda for America, one that recog-nizes the challenges of climate change and that empowers people to be part of the solution. 
The Pope has called climate change 
‘‘one of the principal challenges facing humanity in our day.’’ He has gained international attention for his commit-ment to protecting our world and serv-ing those in need. Thursday, when we have the once-in-a-lifetime oppor-tunity to hear from the Pope as he ad-dresses Congress, I anticipate he will call on all Americans to come together to tackle many challenges, but among them is climate change. 
During my time in the Senate, we 
have made some progress on this issue. In 2008 we took action to raise gas 
mileage standards for cars for the first time in decades. We have also made en-ergy efficiency improvements for con-sumer goods and have maintained tax credits for energy-efficient products and renewable sources. We passed farm bills in 2008 and again in 2014 with a large number of conservation, environ-ment, and energy groups strongly sup-porting them. As a member of the Com-mittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, I have ensured that the en-ergy title promoted investment in the next generation of biofuels crops, which are important renewable sources of energy. Earlier this year, we passed 
the Energy Efficiency Improvement Act of 2015, bipartisan legislation spon-sored by Senators P
ORTMAN and S HA-
HEEN . It included the Water Heater Ef-
ficiency Act, which I worked on with Senator H
OEVEN . This bipartisan meas-
ure enabled rural electric co-ops to op-timize their energy management through continued use of energy-effi-cient water heaters. It also included measures to encourage energy effi-ciency practices in office spaces. These achievements are thanks to a combina-tion of many factors. It continues to be the case that we need bipartisanship to move sound energy policy forward. And while we have taken some action, there is so much more to be done. 
This summer, the Energy and Nat-
ural Resources Committee passed a bi-partisan, comprehensive energy bill. I commend Chairwoman M
URKOWSKI for 
her tireless efforts and Senator C ANT-
WELL for her introduction today of the 
Energy bill—a bill I am a sponsor of— which sets a bar on comprehensive en-ergy policy reform that would aggres-sively move our country forward in ad-dressing climate change. Both of these pieces of legislation include the bill I have with Senator H
OEVEN , the Non-
profit Energy Efficiency Act, which would allow the nonprofit community to save energy and money through a retrofit program. 
During my time in the Senate, I have 
worked to find innovative solutions that move us forward. One example is this bill. Our bill empowers the non-profit and faith communities to make energy efficiency improvements. It would help both our environment and our local communities by ensuring nonprofit organizations can benefit from policies that promote greater en-ergy savings and efficiencies. 
Whether feeding the hungry, helping 
the sick, or mentoring youth, my State’s nearly 7,000 nonprofit organiza-tions work hard every day to make a difference in people’s lives. Nonprofit organizations are at the heart of our country and serve millions of Ameri-cans every day. Houses of worship, hos-pitals, schools, youth centers, and other not-for-profit entities provide critical services and assistance to com-munities across the country, but like businesses they must count their pen-nies and operate on a budget. Right now, nonprofit organizations—which, by the way, are often in very old build-
ings, including churches, synagogues, mosques—cannot benefit from any of the energy efficiency programs avail-able to regular businesses because these programs are provided in the form of tax credits, and because non-profits are tax exempt they can’t get these credits. That often leaves non-profits with a difficult choice. They can either invest in energy efficiency projects or they can dedicate their very scarce resources to providing valuable resources to the community, but we know investing in energy efficiency improvements today can lead to sav-ings over time that go beyond the cost of the initial investment. So our non-profits find themselves asking this question: Should we help fewer people for a year or two in order to replace our heating system and then use the long-term savings to serve our commu-nity well into the future? That is not a choice they should have to make. 
Our bill provides $10 million each 
year for the next 5 years to create a pilot program at the U.S. Department of Energy that would help local non-profit organizations make their build-ings more energy efficient. The grants would promote energy efficiency in savings by helping to upgrade and ret-rofit old buildings as well as installing renewable energy generators and heat-ers. We worked to ensure that the grants will achieve a significant amount of energy savings and are done in a cost-effective manner. The grants would require a 50-percent match so that there is complete buy-in from nonprofits. This will be especially valu-able to the many nonprofit organiza-tions that work from older, less en-ergy-efficient buildings. 
We are taking a fiscally responsible 
approach. Our amendment is fully off-set. We have support from both sides of the aisle with not just Senator H
OEVEN  
and myself but Senators S TABENOW , 
RISCH, S CHATZ , B LUNT , M IKULSKI , 
WHITEHOUSE , and U DALL . I am proud to 
say we have the support of many reli-gious organizations and nonprofits, in-cluding the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops that has been a leading sup-porter of our efforts. They say the bill would enable them to reduce their op-erating costs, lessen impact on their environment, and bolster America’s en-ergy independence. 
The bill is now part of both the En-
ergy Policy Modernization Act that re-cently passed in a bipartisan manner out of the Energy and Natural Re-sources Committee, and it is also part of the bill Senator C
ANTWELL intro-
duced this morning. Although Senators may differ on the specific details of these two energy plans, I believe we can find broad agreement that energy efficiency must be a part of any energy plan. Energy efficiency is an issue we should be able to find common ground on. It is good for the economy, good for consumers, and good for the environ-ment.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6885 September 22, 2015 
I urge my fellow Senators to work to-
gether to keep taking real steps for-ward on meaningful energy legislation that does something about climate change. 
As we prepare to welcome Pope 
Francis to this Congress, it is time to pass legislation that will help non-profits continue to serve our commu-nities and conserve our natural re-sources for generations to come. 
I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Nebraska. 
Mrs. FISCHER. Madam President, I 
rise to reiterate the importance of pro-viding necessary resources to our men and women in uniform. 
We are rapidly approaching the end 
of the fiscal year, and there are many major issues awaiting thoughtful con-sideration and action by Congress. There is one item on our to-do list that should have already been checked off; that is, fully funding our national secu-rity. That is why I am very dis-appointed that once again efforts to ad-vance the Department of Defense Ap-propriations Act were halted today by my friends on the other side of the aisle. 
Congress’s first priority is, and 
should be, the defense of our Nation. We should not be hindered by political games in meeting that core duty that we have. The world is a dangerous place. It is not getting any safer. We cannot afford to be complacent about these threats. Our Nation faces chal-lenges from nation states and asym-metric threats. These threats span the globe. 
In Asia, Chinese behavior in the 
South China Sea threatens the long-standing freedom of navigation and our ability to operate on the high seas. Continuing China’s pattern of increas-ing antagonism, a senior Chinese admi-ral recently declared that the entire South China Sea belongs to China. Chi-na’s increasing military power, bul-lying of its neighbors, expansionist policies, and rejection of international norms threatens to upend the stability of that region. Simply put, China’s be-havior has dramatic consequences for the interests of the United States and our allies. The Asia-Pacific region will continue to grow in importance to the global economy. The ability of our military to operate freely in the Pa-cific is a key component to our na-tional defense strategy and our eco-nomic security. We must vote to pro-vide the necessary resources to address this challenge. 
Additionally, the violence in Syria 
and Iraq continues to grow. This insta-bility has created a vacuum in which terrorist groups like ISIL continue to operate. Its actions threaten the secu-rity of the United States and its allies in the region as well as basic human rights and religious freedom. 
These challenges are far from the 
only threats that are facing our Na-tion. We still have thousands of serv-icemembers deployed in Afghanistan. What is more, regional conflicts in 
Yemen and Libya jeopardize U.S. inter-ests. The same is true of the growing number of terrorist groups from the Sinai Peninsula to West Africa. 
Congress must ensure that our Na-
tion’s military has the necessary re-sources to protect the United States and to meet our commitments to our allies. As the character of these threats changes between the conventional, the unconventional, and the unknown, fail-ure to appropriate defense resources is a threat in itself to our defense strat-egy. 
As a Member of the Senate Armed 
Services Committee, I have heard our Nation’s highest military officers re-peatedly testify on a wide array of threats to our national security. For example, in his testimony to the Sen-ate Armed Services Committee on July 29, Secretary of Defense Ash Carter highlighted the threat that is posed by Iran. Beyond its nuclear program, Iran’s support for proxies like Hezbollah and the Assad regime, its hostility toward our ally Israel, and its contribution to the ongoing violence in Yemen—they all present very serious threats to the interests of the United States. 
Additionally, referring to the nuclear 
deal President Obama has signed with Iran, Secretary Carter said the deal places ‘‘no limitations on what the De-partment of Defense can and will do to pursue our defense strategy in the re-gion’’—‘‘no limitations on what the De-partment of Defense can and will do.’’ 
For the Department of Defense to op-
erate robustly and swiftly and without limitation requires funding of its peo-ple, programs, equipment, supplies, and research and development. Yet with an array of dangers facing our Nation, the Commander in Chief of our military has stated he will veto defense spend-ing unless it is accompanied by an in-crease in nondefense spending. 
To be clear, this appropriations bill 
would provide the President with the funding he asked for in his budget re-quest. A strong bipartisan majority in this body has already voted that we must provide our military men and women with the resources they need to protect this country. In June of this year, the Senate voted 71 to 25 and said we must authorize spending at a level similar to what is contained in the De-fense appropriations bill, but when it comes to actually appropriating the necessary resources by stepping up and voting to supply our military service-members with the resources they need to accomplish the missions they are given, the minority party objects be-cause they contend that nondefense spending is insufficient. 
I fundamentally disagree with this 
view. All government spending is not created equal. Resources that support our soldiers should not be held up for any reason—least of all in an attempt to increase spending on various objec-tives that are championed by the EPA or the IRS. For the first time in 6 years, the Sen-
ate Appropriations Committee has sent all 12 appropriations bills to the floor. That is a positive step. That is a good thing, but unfortunately, despite their support in committee, my friends on the other side of the aisle have blocked them on this floor. 
So now we find ourselves once again 
at the brink. Once again, we are veer-ing toward a crisis. We can and we must do better to responsibly govern. That starts with providing for our com-mon defense. 
I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, 
today Pope Francis arrives in Wash-ington. In 2 days, he will be speaking to a joint meeting of Congress, where he will undoubtedly remind us all to remember what he has termed ‘‘the most abandoned.’’ 
It was Pope Francis who said: ‘‘I in-
vite all of the institutions of the world, the Church, each of us, as one single human family, to give a voice to all of those who suffer silently from hunger, so that this voice becomes a roar which can shake the world.’’ 
He continued and said: ‘‘This cam-
paign [to end hunger] is an invitation to all of us . . . to stop thinking that our daily actions do not have an im-pact on the lives of those who suffer from hunger firsthand.’’ 
It turns out that the Pope’s message 
on addressing hunger is more timely than we could have imagined. In a mo-ment, I will explain why. It has to do with the government shutdown. Cer-tainly we know from 2 years ago that a government shutdown hurts every fam-ily in America, it hurts small busi-nesses across America, it sets the econ-omy back, it creates all sorts of ob-structions and frustrations, and it is a self-inflicted wound on America. Yet my colleagues across the aisle are con-tending that is exactly where they want to head, another showdown over social issues. We have been down this road before. It is a needless self-in-flicted wound. We shouldn’t be plan-ning to go there. 
But here is why the Pope’s words on 
hunger are particularly timely: 
Two years ago when we had a govern-
ment shutdown, it did not impact the program known as SNAP or food stamps—the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or food stamps, as we often refer to it. That is because we still had funds left from the stimulus program to be able to make sure hun-gry Americans did have the ability to receive the credits on their electronic food stamp card and to purchase gro-ceries for their families. But we are in a different position this time around. 
Last Friday the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture notified the Appropria-tions Committee that because the stimulus funds that existed 2 years ago are not there any longer, that come Oc-tober 1, if we shut this government down, then we are also going to be

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6886 September 22, 2015 
shutting down food stamps—that is 
shutting down food stamps for 45 mil-lion Americans. 
In my home State of Oregon, there 
are about one out of five Oregonians who depend on food stamps to hold hunger at bay. We are certainly talk-ing about an incredible number of chil-dren among that number, so across the country, millions of children, millions more Americans—45 million Ameri-cans. Yet here we are saying that it is all right to shut down food stamps and leave millions of Americans with the prospect of going hungry. 
It causes me to reflect on Robert 
Kennedy’s effort to take on hunger. He was known back in 1967 to have visited children in Mississippi, and he said the following: 
I have seen children in the Delta area of 
Mississippi with distended stomachs, whose faces are covered with sores from starvation, and we haven’t developed a policy so we can get enough food so that they can live, so that their children, so that their lives are not de-stroyed. I don’t think that’s acceptable in the United States of America and I think we 
need a change. 
That is what Robert Kennedy said to 
our Nation. His advocacy had an im-pact in two particular areas, and that is that we proceeded to put a lot more resources into fighting hunger and we rewrote the food stamp regulations to provide greater access for those at the lowest income levels. The Food Stamp Program—or as it is now called, SNAP—has become the largest, most effective program in the United States in the fight against hunger. 
Again, the USDA contacted us Fri-
day of last week and said it looks like they will have to shut down this pro-gram if there is a government shut-down. This did not happen 2 years ago, so this is new information. They said they are going to work through the weekend to see if they can find any way with an existing law to prevent this from happening. As of this morn-ing, they had been unable to find any legal pathway to extend the Food Stamp Program should we be in a gov-ernment shutdown. 
In our country, the poverty threshold 
for a family of four is about $24,000. For a family of four, that translates to about $6,000 a person. More than half of those who receive food stamps live in families who are below 50 percent of that threshold or roughly $3,000 per year per individual in the family. 
In my home State of Oregon, SNAP 
provides food benefits for about 800,000 residents or, as I mentioned, one in five Oregonians. This will have a wide-spread impact on hundreds of thou-sands of individuals in my home State and for my colleagues, hundreds of thousands of individuals in their States—45 million across the country. The USDA tells us that the timing for the recharging of the food stamp cards varies. Not everyone will be affected on October 1, but all of those 45 million would be affected in the month of Octo-ber. The majority of the SNAP recipi-ents in Oregon and nationwide are vul-nerable populations. They are children. 
They are the disabled. They are the el-derly. Can we not come together in a responsible fashion to prevent sending millions of Americans into a crisis over available food, millions of children across our country in a crisis because they do not have food because of our inability to act responsibly? 
The words Robert Kennedy used were 
that this should not happen in Amer-ica. Let me repeat that certainly I be-lieve this should not happen in Amer-ica. I cannot conceive of any moral ar-gument that would justify leaving our children, our disabled, our elderly hun-gry because a few people in this body want to make a political point over a social issue. That is unacceptable. 
I do a lot of townhalls back home in 
Oregon, one in every county every year. I hear from folks who are worried over a lot of issues. They are certainly worried about finding a good job. They are certainly worried about the cost of sending their children to college. They are certainly worried about cuts to Head Start programs and the quality of their public schools. They are worried about the possibility of a secure retire-ment. And now, because of the threats of partisan point-making here in the body of the Senate, they are going to have to worry about whether they can put dinner on the table and feed their children. That is wrong. 
The American people are sick and 
tired of Congress manufacturing crises like this. Let’s move beyond this brinkmanship and this hostage poli-tics. Let’s avert this shutdown. Let’s carry out the responsibilities to the people of the United States of America. 
Pope Francis said in that initial 
quote I noted that he invited all of the institutions of the world to give voice to all those who suffer silently from hunger. Little did he imagine that on the day he arrived here in Washington, DC, this institution—the U.S. Senate— would be involved not only in not help-ing those who are hungry but plotting and planning a shutdown of the govern-ment that will put millions of Ameri-cans into a food crisis. Let’s change that. Let’s come together. Let’s ad-dress a responsible plan for carrying the full funding of our government for-ward. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Georgia. 
Mr. PERDUE. Madam President, I 
want to thank the majority leader for bringing the Defense appropriations bill to the floor for a vote and remind everyone that the Senate Appropria-tions Committee has put forward 12 ap-propriations bills that adhere to the Republican budget and that reflect the priorities of the American people. 
You have heard all year that we need 
to get back to regular order, and that means we need to bring up and debate each of these 12 bills individually. It is clear after two votes that the Demo-cratic obstructionism through the De-fense appropriations bill will prevent us from funding our service men and women. My colleagues across the aisle 
are voting against supplying the mili-tary with the tools to stop ISIS. They are voting against the much needed up-grades to our missile defense program. They are voting against increasing missile defense support to Israel. They are voting against restoring readiness to our military. 
The demands on our military are 
great. The threats we face today as a nation are numerous, complex, and may be the most dangerous in my life-time. Those who also volunteer to de-fend our great Nation against these threats rely on us to meet these obliga-tions as Senators. 
Congress is responsible for ensuring 
that American service men and women have the tools they need to do their jobs and remain safe. But today my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have done our Nation a great dis-service. By failing to bring up the De-fense appropriations bill, Democrats aren’t letting us do our job. That is dangerous. 
We need to return to regular order 
and vote on these appropriations bills so that the priorities of the American people can once and for all be restored.

INSPECTOR GENERAL VACANCY AT THE VA  
Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, the 
Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee—headed by Chair-man J
OHNSON and Ranking Member 
CARPER —had a very important hearing 
where we heard from whistleblowers from the VA, and then afterwards we heard from VA officials and representa-tives from the inspector general’s of-fice. The issue of how we treat those who have served the country is so crit-ical to who we are as a nation. Yet, over the last year, we have learned of shocking failures at the Department of Veterans Affairs, and today’s testi-mony, unfortunately, was no different in terms of how whistleblowers were retaliated against at the Department of Veterans Affairs. Instead of a cul-ture that encourages people to come forward when things go wrong, people who come forward when things go wrong are treated badly and also face consequences as far as their employ-ment, and that is wrong. 
Over the last year, we have seen 
shocking failures, including veterans being denied care after being placed on secret wait lists, experiencing extended delays in benefits, and endless wait times for repeals, reviews, or action on claims. 
Recently, we also learned that as of 
last year, the VA had 867,000 pending

health care enrollment records. That is 
almost 1 million records without a final determination status—some from decades ago. Nearly one-third of the veterans who had applied to the VA for care have now been reported as having died. Additionally, the VA staff has de-leted 10,000 transaction records, but the reasons are undocumented. These fail-ures are outrageous, and that word is used a lot around here, but this truly does define what is happening in our VA—outrageous. 
Our veterans, who have served and 
sacrificed so much for our country, de-serve the very best care and support we can give them. The VA has fallen short time and time again in meeting that goal. 
The bipartisan VA reform bill, en-
acted last summer, represents an im-portant step in increasing account-ability and mismanagement at the de-partment, and also giving our veterans the choice of care in their communities rather than waiting in line. That is very important to my State, New Hampshire, where, unfortunately, we don’t have a full-service veterans hos-pital. There is so much more work to be done on that front; however, we con-tinue to hear about reports of bureau-cratic delays and failures at the VA, such as overprescribing opiates, bo-nuses paid to employees involved in se-rious misconduct, enrollment record mayhem, and inflated claims of VA employees being held accountable and fired. Unfortunately, we still can’t get a number, even after all the wait-list scandals where veterans literally died while waiting for care. 
I have a few recent headlines about 
the VA. In the Chicago Tribune, Janu-ary 9, ‘‘Veterans: VA hospital nick-named ‘Candy Land’ because pain-killers given out freely.’’ 
Arizona Republic, February 13, 
‘‘Whistle-blowers: VA still endangering suicidal vets.’’ 
Washington Post, March 9, ‘‘Veteran 
Affairs manager pokes fun at mental health issues with photo of elf begging for Xanax.’’ 
Associated Press, April 9, ‘‘Veterans 
hospital wait times haven’t improved.’’ 
Stars and Stripes, April 13, ‘‘Whistle-
blowers say retaliation unabated year into VA scandal.’’ 
The Washington Post on May 14, 
‘‘Veterans Affairs improperly spent $6 billion annually, senior official says.’’ 
In light of all of the issues that have 
been raised with our VA, can you imag-ine that we are in a place where there is no permanent inspector general who has been appointed by the President to serve in that important watchdog posi-tion for the Veterans’ Administration after all of the issues I just cited in this Chamber? There are many more issues that I didn’t even have on this list. 
The inspector general position at the 
Veterans’ Administration has been va-cant since December of 2013. That is 631 days—631 days that the President has failed to appoint someone to ensure that there is critical oversight and 
transparency at the Veterans’ Admin-istration. In fact, we have just had act-ing individuals in that position. We have not had a permanent watchdog in that position. In light of everything we have been through, we have had 631 days without adequate accountability; 631 days without permanent oversight leadership; 631 days without a perma-nent watchdog to investigate scandals that have tarnished the promises we made to our veterans which they earned by defending our great Nation; 631 days without the President even submitting a nomination to fill this empty position. That is unacceptable. 
We need the President to step up and 
appoint an inspector general to be the watchdog for the Veterans’ Adminis-tration so they can have a continuity of leadership. There is no more impor-tant oversight issue right now. 
I have written the President, along 
with Members on both sides of the aisle. We have repeatedly called on the President to make a nomination for this inspector general position, and we know that—through the process— names of individuals who are qualified to serve in this position have actually been submitted to the President’s desk. Both sides of the aisle in this body agree on this issue. Our desire—on a bi-partisan basis—is to make sure that those who have defended, served, and answered the call of duty for our Na-tion receive the very best care for what they have done to defend our freedom. Yet, after all the scandals and all the issues and challenges that our veterans face, can you imagine leaving this par-ticular position open for 631 days? 
I am, again, in this Chamber going to 
call on the President, and I know that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, whom I have worked with on this issue, agree that it is time for the President of the United States to nomi-nate a qualified individual—he has had many names submitted to him—to serve in this critical watchdog position as the permanent inspector general for the VA with the full authority to con-duct the investigations that need to be conducted on issues that have been raised repeatedly about the Veterans’ Administration. 
What is clear from the testimony we 
heard today at the homeland security committee hearing is that we have so much more work to do to ensure ac-countability at the Veterans’ Adminis-tration and to ensure that our veterans get the very best of what they deserve and have earned by defending our Na-tion. 
What is clear is that the IG council 
has done its job and nominated individ-uals for the President to consider for this inspector general position. 
I am now calling on the President: 
Mr. President, please nominate a quali-fied individual to be a permanent VA inspector general in order to protect our veterans. 
Mr. President, 631 days is already 
way too long, and our veterans should not have to wait a day longer to have 
this position filled. This important agency needs a watchdog that is there to serve them. 
I thank the Presiding Officer. With that, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The

PUERTO RICO  
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I 
rise today deeply concerned about the growing economic crisis in Puerto Rico, which threatens to destabilize the island, and that we must step in and help our fellow American citizens— but sometimes we forget that the 3.5 million people who live in Puerto Rico are American citizens—before a finan-cial crisis becomes a calamity. 
I again urge, as I recently did in a 
letter to Secretary Lew, along with seven Members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, that the Department of the Treasury move beyond simply providing technical assistance and take a full-throated leadership role to re-solve this crisis immediately as we have done in previous financial crises. If we do not act, the result could be a financial disorder that will, at the end of the day, be much more expensive, much more chaotic, and will, in both the long and short term, cost Puerto Rico and the United States. 
The fact is that a potential solution 
rests in the hands of the administra-tion, with Treasury and with HHS. As we said in the letter to Secretary Lew, the world is watching Puerto Rico, and we must ensure that the United States does everything in its power to take strong, bold, and substantive action 
that stabilizes the situation and pro-tects the 3.5 million American citizens on the island and their families. Tech-nical assistance and advice from Treas-ury is all well and good, but, in my view, it is just not enough. 
Treasury needs to take an active 
role, and Congress needs to approve the pending debt restructuring legislation I introduced with Senators B
LUMENTHAL , 
SCHUMER , and other Senate colleagues 
that would allow the government of Puerto Rico to authorize its public utilities to rework their debts under chapter 9. That is in the best interests of both Puerto Rico and the mainland. 
The fact of the matter is Puerto Rico 
would actually be running a surplus—a surplus—if it did not have to make debt payments. Allowing government- owned corporations to restructure their debts using a sound legal process would give the island breathing room to make necessary reforms and would not cost U.S. taxpayers a dime. This could go a long way to promote the fairest and most efficient outcome. 
The idea has been endorsed by the 
editorial boards of the Wall Street

Journal, the Washington Post, 
Bloomberg View, the New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, the Boston Globe, and others. The bill is also sup-ported by the nonpartisan National Bankruptcy Conference and numerous bankruptcy lawyers and judges. 
Additionally, it is clear that the is-
land’s health care system is adding ad-ditional pressure to the overall finan-cial situation, accounting for 20 per-cent of the island’s economy and re-sponsible for a third of its overall debt burden. Sixty percent of Puerto Ricans living on the island are enrolled in Medicare or Medicaid. And because of the disparity in how these two health programs are funded relative to the 50 States, the financial crisis is only ex-acerbated. 
To help alleviate some of this pres-
sure on the health care system, I have introduced the Improving the Treat-ment of U.S. Territories Under Federal Health Programs Act of 2015 with Sen-ators S
CHUMER , NELSON , GILLIBRAND , 
and B LUMENTHAL . This legislation pro-
vides several policies that will ensure Puerto Rico providers, both hospitals and physicians, are treated more equal-ly to the States under the Medicare and Medicaid programs. 
Just as importantly, this legislation 
ensures that beneficiaries on the island are treated equally too. As citizens of the United States, it is imperative that Puerto Ricans be afforded the same ac-cess to care, coverage, and health bene-fits as everyone else. 
While I believe this legislation will 
go a long way toward addressing the is-land’s systemic health care issues, there are several steps that HHS can take immediately and without the need for congressional action. They can change payment calculations under Medicare Advantage and Medicare’s in- patient hospital rules to more accu-rately reflect the costs and demo-graphics on the island. By making nec-essary adjustments to certain key pay-ment formulas, HHS could make the practice of medicine a financially via-ble option in Puerto Rico and stem the tide of physicians leaving the island for the U.S. mainland and ensure that our fellow Americans living on the island are able to receive the care they need and deserve. I urge not only Treasury Secretary Lew but HHS Secretary Burwell to do all they can to provide fi-nancial and health care-related relief to Puerto Rico to help curb the island’s financial crisis. 
Now, Governor Garcia Padilla’s 
Working Group for the Fiscal and Eco-nomic Recovery of Puerto Rico has also recently released a 5-year plan earlier this month. While I don’t agree with everything included in the plan, it shows a determined and legitimate ef-fort to confront the economic crisis facing the island. Unfortunately, the current debt structure and legal re-straints threaten the effectiveness of these proposed reforms. Without pro-viding some flexibility and room to maneuver, all the difficult choices in the world won’t be able to resolve the 
crisis. 
I wish to make it, however, abso-
lutely clear: I am not—I am not—call-ing for a Federal bailout of Puerto Rico. But there is still much we can and should do to restore solvency to the island that is home to 3.5 million Americans. Our bond with these Ameri-cans who live on the island has always been strong. Our relationship with Puerto Rico is long and deep and exten-sive. With more than 5 million Puerto Ricans residing in the United States— more than in Puerto Rico itself—we are inextricably tied. 
Now, I should not need to remind this 
body that from the infancy of our Na-tion, the people of Puerto Rico have been there for us. Now we need to be there for them. Puerto Rico was ceded to the United States in 1898 after the Spanish-American war. Less than two decades later, in 1917, Congress passed the Jones Act, granting American citi-zenship to residents of the island. 
But even long before they were 
granted U.S. citizenship, Puerto Ricans have had a long and proud history of fighting on the side of America. As far back as 1777, Puerto Rican ports were used by U.S. ships, enabling them to run British blockades and keep com-merce flowing, which was so crucial to the war effort. It was Puerto Rican sol-diers who took up arms in the U.S. Civil War, defending Washington, DC, from attack and fought in the Battle of Fredericksburg. In World War I, almost 20,000 Puerto Ricans were drafted into the U.S. Armed Forces. Let’s not forget about the 65th Infantry Regiment, known as the Borinqueneers, the seg-regated military unit composed almost entirely of soldiers from Puerto Rico that played a prominent and crucial role in World War I, World War II, and the Korean war, one of the most highly decorated regiments known in military history. 
I am proud to say I have worked with 
Senator B
LUMENTHAL and others to 
make sure that the heroic Borinqueneers, the only Active-Duty segregated Latino military unit in the history of the United States and the last segregated unit to be deactivated, received well-deserved and long-over-due national recognition when we passed a bill last year awarding these courageous patriots with the Congres-sional Gold Medal—the highest expres-sion of national appreciation for distin-guished achievements and contribu-tions to the United States. 
It is very easy to point our fingers at 
our brothers and sisters on the island and fault Puerto Rico for carrying more than $70 billion in debt. But I challenge my Senate colleagues to work with me on finding solutions, to step up to our responsibility at the Federal level by seeking opportunities for Congress and the administration to correct some of the inequities that have contributed to this crisis. I am talking about the unequal Medicare and Medicaid funding that I referenced earlier, the exclusion of Puerto Rico 
from the Supplemental Security In-come program that aids the most vul-nerable Americans, the exclusion of Puerto Rico from the child tax credit and earned income tax credit, which encourages low-income individuals to seek employment, and, as previously mentioned, the exclusion of Puerto Rico from chapter 9 of the U.S. Bank-ruptcy Code. 
Now, more than ever, we need to be 
asking in Washington what steps can be taken to manage this crisis. Un-equal treatment at the Federal level is, whether we want to own up to it or not, a contributing factor to the cur-rent economic crisis. The lack of Fed-eral support has encouraged heavy bor-rowing by the Puerto Rican govern-ment of many, many administrations going back. We must do our part, both in Congress and the administration, to address this crisis, and we must act now, with urgency. 
I think the point is clear. As I said, 
we have a special, historic, unshakeable bond with Puerto Rico, and now is the time to strengthen that bond. The time has come to prevent the worsening fiscal crisis in Puerto Rico. The time has come to help Puer-to Rico, and we can do so simply by giving them the wherewithal to help themselves through the Bankruptcy Code, as we would any other similar entity, to have the wherewithal to have an orderly restructuring and to get their economic future back in shape. 
With that, Mr. President, I yield the 
floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

clerk will call the roll.

Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, we are 
on the eve of yet another government shutdown, yet another manufactured crisis. Two years ago it was over defunding the Affordable Care Act. Today Republicans introduced a con-tinuing resolution that holds our coun-try hostage over funding for Planned Parenthood. 
The 2013 shutdown of a couple years 
ago cost billions of dollars in economic losses. We heard many stories of hard-ships caused by the shutdown, includ-ing small business owners who were suffering because our national parks closed, public safety workers pro-tecting our country without pay, and Federal contractors left holding the bag for personnel and program costs. We cannot do this to our working fami-lies for the second time in 3 years. We cannot do this to our country.

evidence of wrongdoing by Planned 
Parenthood. Threatening to shut down the government over an organization that annually provides 400,000 cervical cancer screenings, 500,000 breast exams, and 4.5 million tests and treatments for sexually transmitted diseases is com-pletely uncalled for. 
Arguments that there are other pro-
viders that can fill the important and critical role of Planned Parenthood are not persuasive. According to the Guttmacher Institute, Planned Parent-hood serves more contraceptive clients each year than any other similar pro-vider, including federally qualified health centers. In more than 300 coun-ties across the country, safety net pro-viders such as Planned Parenthood are the providers of choice for nearly half of women. Furthermore, Planned Par-enthood is the sole safety net provider in nearly 100 of these counties. 
Planned Parenthood services cannot 
be easily replaced. In an attempt to defund Planned Parenthood, one State submitted a list of providers they said could replace Planned Parenthood’s critical women’s health care services. This list that the State provided in-cluded dentists, ophthalmologists, ra-diologists, and nursing homes. Think about that. Providers are not widgets. 
After a Federal judge called their 
bluff, the State cut their list from over 2,000 providers to just 29 providers who actually are able to provide primary care services to women. Those 29 pro-viders could not possibly absorb the thousands of patients Planned Parent-hood served in that State. Planned Parenthood has long been in the cross-hairs of the anti-choice movement. 
This recent attack on Planned Par-
enthood is based on heavily edited vid-eos by radical fringe groups. I refer my colleagues to a letter from Planned Parenthood’s Cecile Richards to House and Senate leadership dated August 27, 2015. 
Instead of improving the lives of 
women by passing legislation raising the minimum wage, closing the gender pay gap or ensuring paid leave for all workers, my colleagues across the aisle continue to narrowly focus on ways to further marginalize women. Instead of introducing continuing resolutions that contain these kinds of poison pills, such as defunding Planned Par-enthood, we must pass clean legislation that keeps our government funded, that provides needed and critical serv-ices to the people of this country. I ask my colleagues to join with me.

REMEMBERING TROOPER JOSEPH 
CAMERON PONDER 
Mr. M CCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
rise to pay tribute to a Kentucky State Police trooper who was tragically lost in the line of duty. Trooper Joseph Cameron Ponder, of Rineyville, was shot and killed while pursuing a sus-pect on September 13. He was 31 years old. 
Cameron Ponder was proud to be a 
Kentucky State trooper. ‘‘He was eager and he absolutely loved his job,’’ is how a State police spokesman described him. He was also new to the job, having just graduated in January of this year from the Kentucky State Police Train-
ing Academy. He was stationed at the State police post in Mayfield. 
Before becoming a Kentucky State 
trooper, Cameron served in the U.S. Navy. He enlisted in September 2007, when he was 23 years old, and became a Navy diver. Over the next 6 years he was stationed in places as varied as Great Lakes, IL; Coronado, CA; Pan-ama City, FL; and San Diego, CA. 
During his Navy service he received 
several awards, medals and decora-tions, including the Combat Action Ribbon, the Good Conduct Medal, the Navy Expeditionary Medal, the Na-tional Defense Service Medal, the Glob-al War on Terrorism Service Medal, the Expert Rifle Marksmanship Ribbon and the Expert Pistol Marksmanship Rib-bon. 
Cameron was discharged from the 
Navy in July 2013. He was a member of the Church of Christ in Elizabethtown, KY. He was also a dedicated hunter and fisherman who enjoyed the outdoors. 
Sadly, Trooper Ponder is the second 
trooper from the Mayfield post to be killed in the line of duty this year. In June, Trooper Eric K. Chrisman was killed in a vehicle crash. He also had served with the Kentucky State Police for under a year. 
Members of Trooper Ponder’s family 
who are suffering from this loss include his father, Joseph Ponder; his mother, Brenda Tiffany, and her husband Allan; his fiance ´e, Chrystal Coleman; his sis-
ter, Kelly Ponder; his brothers, Damon Tiffany and Travis Tiffany; his grand-mother, Erika Shook; his niece, Mahlea Starks; and many other family members and friends. 
I am proud to share Trooper Ponder’s 
story with my colleagues here in the United States Senate. We’re thinking of his family today as well as his fellow officers of the Kentucky State Police. We are praying for the loved ones he has left behind who are feeling this devastating loss. 
We are honored by Trooper Ponder’s 
service and his extraordinary sacrifice on behalf of his fellow Kentuckians. I hold the deepest admiration and re-spect for Trooper Ponder and for every brave police officer across the Blue-grass State. Law enforcement is both an honorable profession and a dan-gerous one, and Kentucky is grateful they have made a sacred pledge to pro-tect and defend our communities and our lives.

TRIBUTE TO GENERAL MARTIN E. 
DEMPSEY 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I 
recognize and pay tribute to GEN Mar-tin E. Dempsey, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, for his lifetime of serv-ice to our country. His retirement marks more than 41 years of selfless devotion to our military and our Na-tion. A leader of exceptional character and consequence, his humility, cour-age, and expertise will be sorely missed.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6890 September 22, 2015 
A New Jersey native and 1974 grad-
uate of the United States Military Academy, General Dempsey was well prepared to lead our Armed Forces these last 4 years as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. A career armor officer, he has commanded at every level, from platoon leader to combat-ant commander, and his assignments have carried him and his family across the United States and around the world. 
As a company grade officer, he served 
with the 2nd Cavalry in Europe and the 10th Cavalry at Fort Carson. Following troop command, he earned his masters of arts in English from Duke Univer-sity and was assigned to the English Department at West Point. He subse-quently earned additional advanced de-grees from the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College and the Na-tional War College. 
In 1991, General Dempsey deployed 
with the 3rd Armored Division in sup-port of Operation Desert Storm. He later commanded a battalion in Ger-many and then served as the Army’s ‘‘senior scout’’ as the 67th colonel of the Third Armored Cavalry Regiment— the Brave Rifles—before reporting to the joint staff as an assistant deputy director in the J–5 and later as a spe-cial assistant to the 14th Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
In 2003, General Dempsey commanded 
the 1st Armored Division in Baghdad and returned to Iraq in 2005 as the com-manding general of the Multi-National Security Transition Command—Iraq. From 2007 to 2008, he was the deputy commander and then acting com-mander of U.S. Central Command, and from 2008 to 2011, he commanded U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Com-mand. 
Appointed to serve as the Army’s 
37th Chief of Staff, General Dempsey led his beloved Army a short 149 days before being tapped to serve as the 18th Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In that capacity and as the Nation’s highest-ranking military officer, he has served as the principal military ad-viser to the President, the Secretary of Defense, the National Security Coun-cil, and this Congress these past 4 years. 
General Dempsey’s exceptional abil-
ity to coordinate and build consensus among the office of the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Staff, the services, and the combatant commands has served us well and ensured those charged with civilian oversight of the military have received the best mili-tary advice possible to achieve our na-tional objectives. Additionally, he has built trust and strengthened relations with both national and foreign leaders. 
During a period of complex and rapid 
global change, coupled with the mili-tary’s exceptionally high operational tempo and unprecedented fiscal chal-lenges, General Dempsey’s decisive leadership enabled the success of mili-tary operations around the world. He masterfully guided the Joint Force to extraordinary execution of global re-
sponsibilities, from counterterrorism and crisis response, to supporting our allies, building partner capacity, and humanitarian assistance. His efforts strengthened key alliances, bolstered new partnerships, and more closely in-tegrated the military with the other instruments of our national power against the many threats we face. 
Because of those many threats, Gen-
eral Dempsey’s tenure as Chairman has 
been marked by significant transitions in military operations and personnel. His exemplary stewardship helped reset our forces after the conclusion of major combat operations and has prepared them for an increasingly dynamic and unpredictable security environment. 
His leadership was critical during the 
transition of authority to the Afghan National Security Forces following Op-eration Enduring Freedom. Addition-ally, in the fight against ISIL, his ex-pert advice helped formulate the mili-tary component of a sustainable counter-ISIL strategy. He also guided the military’s work as part of the U.S. interagency response to the Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa. 
He guided the Joint Force to cap-
italize on the lessons learned over these past 14 years fighting as a Joint team, undertaking reforms that have driven ‘‘jointness’’ further into our military’s capability development and operational planning. In addition, rec-ognizing the shifting nature of the se-curity environment and our ability to respond to it, General Dempsey led a paradigm shift in how we posture and employ this Joint team around the world. 
At the same time, the past few years 
have witnessed exponential growth of the cyber threat against our Nation, and, in response, General Dempsey has deftly pushed the expansion of our cyber capabilities. He has pressed hard for cyber legislation, championed the rapid development of our cyber forces, and implemented the Joint Informa-tion Environment to optimize and bet-ter defend our military’s information technology infrastructure. These ini-tiatives will be critical to the future security of our Nation. 
As principal steward of the military 
profession, he renewed an internal commitment to strengthen the profes-sion of arms and reinvigorated edu-cation, training, and leader develop-ment. He managed historic decisions, including reforms to general and flag officer ethics, Department-wide im-provements in sexual assault preven-tion and response, expansion of service opportunities for women, and the ex-tension of benefits to same-sex spouses of uniformed servicemembers and De-partment of Defense civilian employ-ees. His stewardship set conditions to preserve the strength of the all-volun-teer force and to ensure servicemem-bers departing the military are suc-cessfully reintegrated back into their communities. 
As he retires, General Dempsey 
should take great pride in his role in ensuring our military remains the best 
supported, best trained, best equipped, and best led force on the planet. His 
contributions to our national security are a testament to his remarkable leadership and selfless dedication. Dur-ing trying times, under sometimes harsh scrutiny and with high national security stakes at hand, his steadfast commitment to the readiness and wel-fare of Joint Force servicemembers and their families, as well as his excep-tional support for commanders and their warfighting requirements, made significant and lasting contributions to our Nation. 
With over four decades of exemplary 
service to our Nation, General Dempsey and his family deserve our most heartfelt gratitude and admira-tion. He and Deanie have my very best wishes for a long, happy, and well-de-served retirement. Our Nation, our Joint Force, and our Army are all bet-ter for his leadership and distinguished service.

OBSERVING THE 50TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE VIETNAM WAR 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, on the 
50th anniversary of the Vietnam war, we reflect with reverence upon a gen-eration that served with honor, distinc-tion, and selflessness. We pay tribute to the 9 million men and women who wore our Nation’s uniform during the Vietnam era, answered our Nation’s call to service, and advanced the sacred ideals of liberty and self-determina-tion. 
All gave some, and some gave all. 
Currently, the names of the more than 58,000 patriots who gave their all are forever etched in black granite on the Vietnam Memorial in our Nation’s Cap-ital. The names of the nearly 1,800 Americans who remain unaccounted for are forever etched in our hearts. 
Nearly 350 patriots from Maine are 
listed among the killed or missing. Among those names is U.S. Army SGT Donald Skidgel, a Medal of Honor re-cipient, born in my hometown of Car-ibou, ME, who served in Vietnam and who gave his life saving the lives of others. On September 14 of this year, Navy pilot LT Neil Taylor was finally laid to rest in his hometown of Range-ley, ME, 50 years to the day after his aircraft was shot down on his 68th mis-sion and he was reported missing. They were patriots in the best American tra-dition. We will never forget them. 
May the families of those who fell 
and of those unaccounted for find peace in knowing that the American people share their loss and grief. We will al-ways be grateful for the valor and sac-rifice of their loved ones. And we will never forget them. 
From the founding of our Nation to 
today, the freedom we hold sacred has been earned by our fellow citizens. Our Nation’s history has been written by the men and women who serve, despite the sacrifices, with courage and devo-tion. The men and women of the Viet-nam era carried on that tradition.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6891 September 22, 2015 
They carry on another tradition that 
echoes throughout our history: After their military service was done, they returned home, quietly and modestly, and continued to serve their commu-nities. 
The American people believe that 
supporting our troops doesn’t stop once they leave the military. Just as no member of our Armed Forces would leave a comrade behind on the battle-field, we must not leave our veterans and their families behind on the battle-fields of injury and disease. We must be strong advocates for veterans’ health care and be concerned about the Viet-nam veterans who were exposed to agent orange. We must remain com-mitted to ensuring that those veterans and their families receive the care and support they have earned. 
The men and women who served our 
Nation a half century ago upheld the highest ideals of America and of the American Armed Forces. Our Vietnam veterans were then, and remain today, heroes who deserve our respect and our gratitude. 
Mr. KING. Mr. President, this month 
marks the 50th anniversary of the in-troduction of U.S. ground troops in the Vietnam war, and I would like to rec-ognize our Vietnam era veterans who dedicated their strength and service to defend freedom and democracy across the globe. In honor of this anniversary, the Secretary of Defense coordinated various events to thank and honor all veterans of the Vietnam war. A well- deserved welcome home ceremony will be held in Presque Isle, ME, on Sep-tember 26, 2015, to recognize and com-memorate the lives of those who fought so bravely. 
For nearly 20 years, the Vietnam war 
occupied the American collective con-science. American involvement ini-tially focused on assisting French forces to counter the Vietminh com-munist revolution. However, in 1964 the Gulf of Tonkin incident dramatically shifted American perspective, and on August 7, President Johnson drafted and Congress unanimously approved a resolution authorizing direct military intervention in Vietnam. 
Throughout the war, the United 
States deployed over 2.7 million serv-icemembers to Vietnam, and over 8 million Americans served in uniform during the Vietnam era. More than 58,200 Americans lost their lives and more than 150,000 were seriously wounded during the conflict. I would like to honor those brave Americans who sacrificed so much for their coun-try. Their contributions to our Nation will never be forgotten. 
Maine played a crucial role in the 
war effort. With one of the highest per-centages of veterans per capita in the nation, the Vietnam war’s legacy still resonates in Maine today. Close to 48,000 people from Maine served in Vietnam, and nearly 350 Maine service-members were killed or went missing in action during the war. Our veterans’ unwavering patriotism, courage, and resilience fully demonstrate the for-
titude of American character and our Nation’s commitment to democracy worldwide. 
On this 50th anniversary of the Viet-
nam war, I would like to join the Sec-retary of Defense in recognizing the brave Americans who served overseas, as well as those on the homefront whose unrelenting support was invalu-able to those overseas. Our veterans have made countless personal sac-rifices in protection of our freedoms, and I am proud to honor and thank them for their service to our great Na-tion.

BEING A TOLERANT AND 
ACCEPTING COUNTRY 
Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, in re-
cent weeks two of the leading con-tenders to be President of the United States called into question the devo-tion of American Muslims to this great country, and one even outrageously suggested that being Muslim precludes you from being President. I denounce this. It is in violation of Article VI of the Constitution and in violation of our County’s basic principles. 
Everyone that serves in public office 
from President to the Senate must up-hold the Constitution. Article VI of the Constitution explicitly states: 
All debts contracted and engagements en-
tered into, before the adoption of this Con-stitution, shall be as valid against the United States under this Constitution, as under the Confederation. 
This Constitution, and the laws of the 
United States which shall be made in pursu-ance thereof; and all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land; and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby, anything in the Constitu-tion or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding. 
The Senators and Representatives before 
mentioned, and the members of the several state legislatures, and all executive and judi-cial officers, both of the United States and of the several states, shall be bound by oath or affirmation, to support this Constitution; but no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States. 
There are 3 million American Mus-
lims in our country. They teach in our schools, they work in our hospitals, and they attend our universities. Their children play on the same playgrounds and go to the same schools. They are able to do this because one of our founding principles on which our coun-try was established was freedom of reli-gion. It is on that basis that the United States should strive to be a tolerant and accepting country where dif-ferences are understood and diversity is celebrated. This is not the America some leading candidates for President imagine. They are perpetuating an un-dercurrent of bigotry by suggesting that American Muslims can’t be Presi-dent because of their religious beliefs. Not only is this contrary to our Amer-ican values, it defies the U.S. Constitu-tion. TRIBUTE TO MARY BEHRENS 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, the 
Wyoming Nurses Association is hon-oring Casper nurse practitioner Mary Behrens with the 2015 Lifetime Achievement award. I am delighted to congratulate Mary on this tremendous honor. 
Following in the footsteps of her 
mother, Mary pursued her passion for service by completing her RN at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1964. She practiced as a nurse in Madi-son while her husband Jerry finished his medical degree and residency. She remained in Madison as Jerry served our Nation as a physician treating 
wounded soldiers in Vietnam. In 1973, the couple moved to Casper, WY. Folks in Wyoming are fortunate that Mary chose to dedicate her career helping others in our State. She is truly an in-novator, leader, and mentor for many nurses in Wyoming across the Nation and around the world. 
The list of Mary’s accomplishments 
and awards is long. She was active on the American Nurses Association board and is a board member of the Univer-sity of Wyoming’s Friends of the Fay W. Whitney School of Nursing. She is one of only three Wyoming nurses to be nationally recognized as a fellow of the American Association of Nurse Practi-tioners, FAANP. Her leadership in this area is incredible. 
In 2005 she was a member of the 
American delegation to the World Health Assembly in Geneva, Switzer-land, where she testified on the na-tional nursing shortage. In addition, through her involvement with the Friendship Bridge program, Mary is credited with helping to establish an education pathway for nurses in Viet-nam. Her efforts to develop a modern baccalaureate curriculum have had a tremendous impact on the global scope of nursing, particularly in Vietnam and neighboring countries. 
Mary’s civic service is not at all lim-
ited to her profession. In fact, she has an established history as a public serv-ant for both Casper and Wyoming. Mary served on the Casper city council and as mayor of Casper. She was also a Natrona county commissioner and a representative in the Wyoming State Legislature. This experience, and her intense desire to make change, has made a profound impact on our State. Mary’s extensive activity in shaping public policy truly stands alone, as few people possess such a wide breadth of policy knowledge, leadership skills, and passion for the nursing profession. 
It is fitting that the Wyoming Nurses 
Association is honoring Mary Behrens with their most prestigious award. Countless patients and nursing stu-dents have benefitted from her leader-ship and care. The nursing profession is stronger because of Mary’s enthusi-astic advocacy. 
Please join me in thanking Mary 
Behrens for her lifetime investment in nursing. Bobbi and I are truly fortu-nate to call her our friend.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO TERRY BOSTON 
∑Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I would 
like to take this moment for the Con-gress to note and honor the work of Terry Boston, president and CEO of PJM Interconnection, LLC. 
It is most fitting that Terry Boston 
be recognized in the C
ONGRESSIONAL  
RECORD , for he has served countless 
Americans and played a key role in en-suring adequate infrastructure to drive America’s economic development and our citizens’ well-being throughout his professional life. 
Since 2008, Terry Boston has served 
as president and chief executive officer of PJM located in Valley Forge, PA. In this role, Terry oversees the largest power grid in North America and the largest electricity market in the world. Terry also is president of the Associa-tion of Edison Illuminating Companies, Inc., and immediate past president of the GO 15, the association of the world’s largest power grid operators. Terry was recently elected to the Na-tional Academy of Engineering, one of the highest professional honors ac-corded an engineer. He is a member of the Board for the Electric Power Re-search Institute. 
Terry Boston is past chair of the 
North American Transmission Forum, dedicated to excellence in performance and sharing industry best practices. He also was one of the eight industry ex-perts selected to direct the North American Reliability Corporation in-vestigation of the August 2003 North-east/Midwest blackout. 
Prior to joining PJM, Terry Boston 
was the executive vice president of the Tennessee Valley Authority, the Na-tion’s largest public power provider. In his 35 years at TVA, Terry directed di-visions in transmission and power oper-ations, pricing, contracts and electric system reliability. 
PJM employs over 600 people in 
Pennsylvania and performs a critical function by ‘‘keeping the lights on’’ 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. PJM helps to ensure the health and well-being of our citizens not just in my State but for over 51 million persons in all or por-tions of the States of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, West Virginia, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, and the District of Columbia. 
Mr. President, Terry Boston has been 
an excellent engineer and an inspira-tional leader in the electric industry. As he retires from PJM, I ask that you join me and the entire Senate in wish-ing Terry success in his future endeav-ors. ∑

REMEMBERING BILLY ROSS 
BROWN 
∑Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the 
agriculture community and the State of Mississippi suffered a great loss with the passing of Billy Ross Brown, Jr., on 
Saturday, September 12, 2015. He was a good friend, a neighbor, a highly re-spected member of his community, and a gentleman who dedicated much of his life to helping Mississippi farmers and improving the overall quality of life in rural America. 
A native of Oxford, MS, Billy Ross 
faithfully served the Farm Credit Sys-tem and U.S. agricultural interests for over 36 years. In 1990 Billy Ross was ap-pointed by President George H. W. Bush to serve on the Farm Credit Ad-ministration Board, and in 1993 he was designated Chairman and Chief Execu-tive Officer of the Board by President Clinton, where he served with distinc-tion until October of 1994. Following his tenure in Washington, Billy Ross returned to Mississippi and was nomi-nated to the First South Farm Credit Board of Directors, a position in which he served until his retirement in March 2005. 
In addition to his contributions to 
the U.S. Farm Credit System, Billy Ross was active in various agriculture and conservation organizations. He served more than 20 years as area vice president for the Mississippi Associa-tion of Conservation Districts and more than 30 years as a commissioner of the Lafayette County Soil and Water Conservation District. Billy Ross also served on the Mississippi Soil and Water Conservation Commission as well as the U.S. Forest Service Na-tional Advisory Committee. He re-ceived many awards for his work in ag-riculture, conservation, forestry and wildlife habitat. 
Billy Ross was a true gentleman who 
illustrated dedication to his commu-nity and country. I am grateful for his friendship and all he accomplished for American agriculture. My thoughts and prayers are with his wife Lynn and the entire Brown family during this sad time. ∑

TRIBUTE TO MARGO WALSH 
∑Mr. KING. Mr. President, today I 
wish to recognize Margo Walsh, found-er of MaineWorks, for her outstanding leadership and dedication to the State of Maine. 
Under Margo’s leadership, 
MaineWorks is strengthening commu-nities and developing infrastructure across our State by providing tem-porary employment in the industrial construction sector to vulnerable la-borers seeking to re-enter the work-force. Margo’s vision has grown MaineWorks into an inclusive and em-powering community for recent immi-grants, low-income laborers, past non-violent offenders, military veterans, and other Mainers recovering from sub-stance abuse. 
Margo holds a BA in Psychology 
from Wheaton College and spent over 10 years in New York City as a re-cruiter for Goldman Sachs’s Invest-ment Banking Division and as an inter-national human resources consultant at Hewitt. She subsequently returned 
to her home State of Maine, deter-mined to channel her passion for eco-nomic and social development towards the common good. 
Margo’s accomplishments at 
MaineWorks, however, extend beyond her initial decision to found the com-pany in 2010. Under her continued lead-ership, MaineWorks has received rec-ognition across the State and nation-wide. In 2014 and 2015, SCORE recog-nized MaineWorks as the most success-ful innovative business in the State of Maine, and in 2014, MaineBiz Magazine named Margo as one of five women to watch. Additionally, MaineWorks is featured on the Federal Minimum Wage Campaign’s video and was re-cently certified as a B-corporation, a testament to the company’s commit-ment to transparency, social develop-ment, and environmental sustain-ability. 
I would like to recognize and thank 
Margo for her ongoing commitment to the State of Maine. Our State owes Margo a great deal for her vision, lead-ership, compassion, and commitment to Maine’s social and economic devel-opment. I look forward to Margo’s con-tinued service to MaineWorks and to the entire State of Maine. ∑

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Mr. WICKER (for himself, 
Mrs. C APITO , Mr. K ING, Mr. 
SCHATZ , Ms. A YOTTE , Ms. C OL-
LINS, and Mr. B ARRASSO ): 
S. 2067. A bill to establish EUREKA 
Prize Competitions to accelerate dis-covery and development of disease- modifying, preventive, or curative treatments for Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia, to encourage efforts to enhance detection and diagnosis of such diseases, or to enhance the qual-ity and efficiency of care of individuals with such diseases; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-sions. 
Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I am 
wearing purple today in honor of World Alzheimer’s Month. As a matter of fact, yesterday, September 21, was World Alzheimer’s Day. So I have cho-sen today to introduce a bill that I hope will lead to a major breakthrough in fighting this terrible disease and treating and potentially curing Alz-heimer’s disease. 
The legislation which I introduced 
this morning is called the EUREKA Act, which stands for Ensuring Useful Research Expenditures is Key for Alz-heimer’s—EUREKA. 
I am taking this moment to briefly 
discuss the problem of Alzheimer’s and to ask my colleagues to get behind this tripartisan legislation and see if we can create some momentum to cure Alz-heimer’s disease in a decade. 
First of all, a little bit about aware-
ness. As we all know, Alzheimer’s is a 100-percent fatal disease. It affects some 36 million people around the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6896 September 22, 2015 
globe. More than 5 million Americans 
currently have Alzheimer’s disease. My mother died of Alzheimer’s disease. I can tell you it is an incredibly personal trial for families who deal with loved ones suffering and ultimately suc-cumbing to this disease. So there is the human cost which so many of us have experienced and are experiencing. 
There is also the cost in dollars and 
cents. Americans will spend $226 billion from our Treasury on Alzheimer’s this year alone. The disease puts an ex-traordinary burden on Medicare and Medicaid. As a matter of fact, one in five Medicare dollars will be spent this year on someone with Alzheimer’s. Think of what we could do to alleviate the suffering our previous speaker was talking about if we didn’t have to spend this $226 billion per year, if we didn’t have to spend one in five of our Medicare dollars on someone with Alz-heimer’s. Consider the 2013 filing from the Rand Corporation. Direct costs of Alzheimer’s exceed similar costs asso-ciated with cancer and heart disease combined. 
According to Rush University, Alz-
heimer’s is responsible for more than 500,000 deaths each year. 
Without a cure or a way to halt this 
disease, these numbers will continue to grow. By 2050 Alzheimer’s is expected to cost $1.1 trillion per year. By then, Medicare and Medicaid could see a 500- percent increase in Alzheimer’s spend-ing. So we have a problem in terms of dollars and cents, and we certainly have a problem in terms of the hard-ship it causes on families today. 
Experts say we need $2 billion a year 
in public research if we are going to get to this goal of conquering Alzheimer’s by 2025. We do the best we can at the National Institutes of Health, but we spend only $586 million a year on Alz-heimer’s research. We need $2 billion a year. We spend roughly a quarter of that amount each year, with very little prospect of getting it up to four times what we are spending now. 
What is the solution? I believe the so-
lution is to go to a concept that has made America great for decades and even centuries, and that is the Amer-ican spirit of innovation and entrepre-neurship and competition. We create, we build, and we make a difference in people’s lives through competition and innovation. So today I have introduced the EUREKA bill, which would estab-lish a national prize for achieving benchmarks in fighting this disease. I want to make it clear that the EURE-KA Act would proceed on a parallel track with what is being done at NIH and the Federal Government in terms of research. It wouldn’t take a penny away from the research dollars cur-rently spent on Alzheimer’s and the funds used to attack Alzheimer’s in so many ways. It would be another route for a breakthrough by establishing a competition to run parallel to the re-search being done. 
We will need to research some mile-
stones before we arrive at an Alz-heimer’s cure. This bill would create a 
system within the government, with cooperation from NIH, to encourage public and private collaboration to help us establish prizes for milestones reached to conquer Alzheimer’s. Of course, we need to remember that prizes are paid only for success. If we don’t meet the milestones, we won’t have to expend the money. 
My excellent staff and I have been 
working for months with some of the leading experts in the United States on this concept, not the least of which is the XPRIZE Foundation, which has done such a good job in establishing breakthroughs in other areas. So we have the support and cooperation of the XPRIZE Foundation. In addition, we have worked with the National In-stitutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration to get as much information as possible, and we think we have come up with a way to have government-funded prizes to conquer this disease. 
This is nothing new. The XPRIZE 
Foundation came along relatively re-cently, but it was inspired by previous examples of success. In 1927 Charles Lindbergh won $25,000 for his Spirit of St. Louis aircraft in a competition to achieve the first nonstop flight be-tween New York City and Paris. He re-ceived a prize for this accomplishment. Today aviation is a $300 billion indus-try. So prizes are not a new strategy. The government already invests in countless areas, including health. As a matter of fact, the America COM-PETES Act gives Federal agencies the authority to conduct prize-based chal-lenges. NIH has already completed doz-ens of them. This builds on that suc-cess. 
I envision that a panel would be es-
tablished under this legislation to set benchmarks that would get us well along the road to conquering Alz-heimer’s. Successful, prize-worthy events would be measures such as iden-tifying an Alzheimer’s biomarker, de-veloping early-detection techniques, or repurposing existing drugs for treat-ment. Milestones such as these would be established by a panel of experts. Think of what could be achieved if peo-ple with expertise combine their skills inside and outside the government to end Alzheimer’s. Think of the progress that could be made toward ending human suffering. 
My bill is S. 2067, the EUREKA Act, 
and it has received support from re-searchers, including the MIND Center at the University of Mississippi in my home State, where we are doing inno-vative, groundbreaking achievements every day on Alzheimer’s. Other orga-nizations supporting the EUREKA Act include the Alzheimer’s Association, Us Against Alzheimer’s, the XPRIZE Foundation, the Alzheimer’s Founda-tion of America, BrightFocus Founda-tion, Leaders Engaged on Alzheimer’s Disease, otherwise known as LEAD, and Eli Lilly. All of these organiza-tions and companies are supporting EUREKA. We already have not bipartisan co-
sponsorship but tripartisan cosponsor-ship of this legislation because we have Republicans, Democrats, and Independ-ents already cosponsoring this EURE-KA Act. 
So I come to the floor today and ask 
my colleagues to talk to their health staff members. Look at this concept. Talk to us about the efforts we are en-gaged in, about the research we have done, about the learned people who know what they are talking about and who have worked with us to bring this bill where it is. I hope we can create some momentum for this act soon. I hope we can attach it to legislation be-fore the end of the year. I hope we can put this on the President’s desk some-time early in the year 2016. 
EUREKA can be a game changer in 
fighting one of the most terrible and horrible and expensive diseases we have. So I would urge my colleagues to look at this, to get back to me. I am going to aggressively be talking to each of my colleagues and asking them to cosponsor this legislation. I think we are onto something. I think we are getting very, very near to achieving this goal of conquering Alzheimer’s within a decade. 
By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and 
Mr. C ARPER ): 
S. 2068. A bill to amend the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986 to include auto-mated fire sprinkler system retrofits as section 179 property and classify cer-tain automated fire sprinkler system retrofits as 15-year property for pur-poses of depreciation; to the Com-mittee on Finance. 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise 
to introduce the Fire Sprinkler Incen-tive Act. I am very pleased to be joined by my colleague from Delaware, Sen-ator C
ARPER , in introducing this bipar-
tisan bill. 
Our bill would encourage commercial 
building owners to invest in life-saving fire safety upgrades. While building codes require sprinklers in new com-mercial buildings, a great number of structures across the U.S. were built and put in service before sprinklers were required. This is of significance in Maine, which has some of the oldest housing stock in the country and which has experienced deadly apartment building fires. 
Maine has a large number of older, 
historic buildings—buildings that gen-erally may not be required to have fire sprinklers. According to the Maine State Housing Authority, Maine has the sixth oldest housing stock in the country. In fact, many of the historic areas of Portland were built following a devastating fire in 1866. This fire de-stroyed most of Portland’s commercial buildings, many of its churches, and countless homes. 
Fire sprinklers are very effective at 
preventing deaths caused by fires. Small business building owners find it difficult, however, to fund adding ret-rofit sprinklers. Our bill would provide

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6897 September 22, 2015 
two tax incentives to encourage build-
ing owners to make this investment. 
Currently, commercial building own-
ers must depreciate fire sprinkler ret-rofits over a lengthy 39-year period. The period for residential buildings is 27 and a half years. This bill reclassi-fies fire sprinkler retrofits as 15-year depreciable property, thus allowing building owners to write off their costs more quickly. The bill also provides an option for certain small businesses to deduct the cost of the fire system up-grades immediately under Section 179 of the tax code. Together, these pro-posals will provide a strong incentive for building owners to install fire sprinkler systems. 
According to the National Fire Pro-
tection Association, in 2013, a fire de-partment responded to a structure fire every 65 seconds, and fire claimed 9 lives every day. Just last October, five young adults were killed when fire swept through a two apartment build-ing near the University of Southern Maine. In addition to these five, 20 other people died in fires in Maine in 2014. Just last month, a fire killed two people in Old Town, ME. Sprinklers de-crease the fire death rate by about 80 percent and the average loss per home fire by about 70 percent. 
This bill was originally drafted in re-
sponse to the deadly nightclub fire in West Warwick, RI, in 2003. One hundred people died in that fire. The building did not have a fire sprinkler system. Let us work together to prevent an-other tragedy like this from happening. I invite my colleagues to join Senator C
ARPER and me in support of this bi-
partisan, common sense legislation. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that a letter of support be printed in the R
ECORD . 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the R
ECORD , as follows: 
CONGRESSIONAL FIRESERVICES  
INSTITUTE , 
September 18, 2015. 
Hon. S USAN COLLINS , 
U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. 
D
EAR SENATOR COLLINS : On behalf of the 
Congressional Fire Services Institute (CFSI), I would like to express our thanks and appre-ciation for sponsoring the Fire Sprinkler In-centive Act. In 2002, CFSI’s National Advi-sory Committee (NAC), a coalition of 35 na-tional fire and emergency service organiza-tions, unanimously approved a resolution ex-pressing the need for federal tax incentives to encourage the installation of automatic fire sprinkler systems in residential and commercial buildings. The introduction of the Fire Sprinkler Incentive Act is an impor-tant step in achieving this goal. 
The cost of fire in America is enormous. 
According to the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), in 2014, there were 1,298,000 fires reported in the United States, leading to 3,275 civilian fire deaths, 15,775 ci-vilian injuries, and $11.6 billion in property damage. When you include the indirect cost of fire, such as lost economic activity, the cost is closer to $108 billion annually. 
Studies by NFPA have concluded that 
buildings outfitted with sprinklers reduce the death rate per fire by at least 57% and decrease the property damage by up to 68%. 
By classifying the retrofit of an automatic fire sprinkler system as an eligible property under Section 179 of the tax code, the Fire Sprinkler Incentive Act will save lives by al-lowing small and medium-sized businesses to deduct the cost of sprinkler systems up to $125,000.00. The legislation would also create a tax incentive for the retrofit of high-rise buildings. In the United States alone, there are nearly 10,000 high-rise fires annually. These structures, when not sprinklered, pose serious safety risks to both civilians and firefighters. 
It is an incontrovertible fact that fire 
sprinklers save lives, including the lives of our firefighters. No firefighter has ever died while fighting a fire in a fully sprinklered structure. But unfortunately approximately 100 firefighters die in the line of duty every year. We, as a nation, owe it to our fire-fighters and their families to make the pro-fession as safe as possible. The Fire Sprin-kler Incentive Act will help us achieve that goal. 
We strongly encourage all members of Con-
gress to support this important piece of leg-islation. Thank you for your leadership on this issue, and best wishes on your continued success and safety. 
Sincerely,

Executive Director. 
By Mr. WYDEN (for himself and 
Mr. M ERKLEY ): 
S. 2069. A bill to amend the Omnibus 
Public Land Management Act of 2009 to modify provisions relating to certain land exchanges in the Mt. Hood Wilder-ness in the State of Oregon; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Re-sources. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I 
am introducing the Mt. Hood Cooper Spur Land Exchange Clarification Act. This bill is a necessary step to ensuring that the Cooper Spur land exchange on Mt. Hood proceeds as Congress origi-nally intended when it passed as a part of the Omnibus Public Lands Bill in 2009. I am pleased to introduce this bill with my colleague from Oregon, Sen-ator J
EFFMERKLEY . 
The Mt. Hood Cooper Spur land ex-
change was included in the Mt. Hood Wilderness designation that passed 6 years ago as part of the Omnibus Pub-lic Lands Act of 2009. The bill, which has now been law for over 6 years, di-rected several land exchanges includ-ing the Cooper Spur land exchange. 
The Cooper Spur land exchange re-
quired the Forest Service to transfer approximately 120 acres of Federal land to Mt. Hood Meadows in exchange for approximately 770 acres of private land, with the goal of keeping develop-ment of Mt. Hood concentrated around the current development at Govern-ment Camp and ensuring the protec-tion of the North side of the mountain. The swap was to be completed in 16 months. It is now 77 months later and the exchange has not moved forward. The delays have angered the public, en-dangered the environment, and have now spurred a lawsuit against the For-est Service. 
The Mt. Hood Cooper Spur Land Ex-
change Clarification Act would make technical corrections to the Original Cooper Spur land exchange provisions 
in the Omnibus Public Lands Act to jumpstart the land exchange and keep the process moving forward so the ex-change can finally be completed, as originally intended. 
I introduced the original Mt. Hood 
Wilderness proposal in 2004 and again in 2006 and 2007 with my then-colleague Senator Gordon Smith of Oregon. As the Wilderness proposal and associated land exchanges took shape, more than 1,700 constituents provided input on the proposal. It was supported by mem-bers of the Oregon congressional dele-gation at the time, then-Governor Kulongoski, the Bush administration, and over 100 community groups. The Mt. Hood Cooper Spur Land Exchange Clarification Act is supported by Mt. Hood Meadows, Friends of Hood River Valley, Clackamas County, and Hood River County. 
The Cooper Spur land exchange was 
an important part of the Mt. Hood Wil-derness designation to ensure the pro-tection of the undeveloped North side of the mountain. In turn, the Mt. Hood Cooper Spur Land Exchange Clarifica-tion Act is needed in order to ensure that the land exchange, a community- driven solution to the development challenges on Mt. Hood, is finally com-pleted. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the text of the bill be printed in the R
ECORD . 
There being no objection, the text of 
the bill was ordered to be printed in the R
ECORD , as follows: 
S. 2069 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

Mr. ENZI (for himself, Mr. C
ARDIN , 
Mr. W YDEN , and Ms. C OLLINS ) sub-
mitted the following resolution; which was considered and agreed to: 
S. R ES. 263 
Whereas people in the United States are 
living longer, and the cost of retirement is increasing significantly; 
Whereas Social Security remains the bed-
rock of retirement income for the great ma-jority of the people of the United States but was never intended by Congress to be the sole source of retirement income for fami-lies; 
Whereas recent data from the Employee 
Benefit Research Institute indicates that, in the United States— 
(1) only approximately 
2⁄3of workers or the 
spouses of the workers are saving for retire-ment; and 
(2) the amount that workers have saved for 
retirement is much less than the amount the workers need to adequately fund their retire-ment years; 
Whereas the financial literacy of workers 
in the United States is important for the workers to understand the need to save for retirement; 
Whereas saving for retirement is a key 
component of overall financial health and se-curity during retirement years, and the im-portance of financial literacy in planning for retirement must be advocated; 
Whereas many workers may not— 
(1) be aware of the various options in sav-
ing for retirement; or 
(2) have focused on the importance of, and 
need for, saving for retirement and success-fully achieving retirement security; 
Whereas, although many employees have 
access through their employers to defined benefit and defined contribution plans to as-sist the employees in preparing for retire-ment, many of the employees may not be taking advantage of those plans at all or to the full extent allowed by Federal law; 
Whereas saving for retirement is necessary 
even during economic downturns or market declines, which makes continued contribu-tions all the more important; 
Whereas all workers, including public and 
private sector employees, employees of tax- exempt organizations, and self-employed in-dividuals, can benefit from developing per-sonal budgets and financial plans that in-clude retirement savings strategies that take advantage of tax-preferred retirement savings vehicles; 
Whereas effectively and sustainably with-
drawing retirement resources throughout the retirement years of an individual is as important and crucial as saving and accumu-lating funds for retirement; and 
Whereas the week of October 18 through 
October 24, 2015 has been designated as ‘‘Na-tional Retirement Security Week’’: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports the goals and ideals of Na-
tional Retirement Security Week, including

of saving adequately for retirement; 
(2) acknowledges the need to raise public 
awareness of a variety of tax-preferred re-tirement vehicles that are used by many peo-ple in the United States but could be used by more; and 
(3) calls on States, localities, schools, uni-
versities, nonprofit organizations, busi-nesses, other entities, and the people of the United States to observe National Retire-ment Security Week with appropriate pro-grams and activities, with the goal of in-creasing the retirement savings and personal financial literacy of all people in the United States, thereby enhancing the retirement se-curity of the people of the United States.

NATING SEPTEMBER 23, 2015, AS ‘‘NATIONAL FALLS PREVENTION AWARENESS DAY’’ TO RAISE AWARENESS AND ENCOURAGE THE PREVENTION OF FALLS AMONG OLDER ADULTS 
Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Mrs. 
M
CCASKILL ) submitted the following 
resolution; which was considered and agreed to: 
S. R ES. 264 
Whereas older adults, 65 years of age and 
older, are the fastest-growing segment of the population in the United States; 
Whereas the number of older adults in the 
United States will increase from 35,000,000 in 2000 to 82,300,000 in 2040; 
Whereas 1 out of 3 adults over age 65 in the 
United States falls each year; 
Whereas falls are the leading cause of both 
fatal and nonfatal injuries among older adults; 
Whereas, in 2013, approximately 2,500,000 
older adults were treated in hospital emer-gency departments for fall-related injuries, and more than 734,000 were subsequently hos-pitalized; 
Whereas, in 2013, more than 25,500 older 
adults died from injuries related to uninten-tional falls, and the death rates from falls among older adults in the United States have risen sharply in the last decade; 
Whereas, in 2013, the total direct medical 
cost of fall-related injuries for older adults, adjusted for inflation, was $34,000,000,000; 
Whereas if the rate of increase in falls is 
not slowed, the annual cost of fall injuries will reach $67,700,000,000 by 2020; and 
Whereas evidence-based programs show 
promise in reducing falls by utilizing cost-ef-fective strategies, such as exercise programs to improve balance and strength, medication management, vision improvement, reduction of home hazards, and fall prevention edu-cation: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates September 23, 2015, as ‘‘Na-
tional Falls Prevention Awareness Day’’; 
(2) recognizes that there are proven, cost- 
effective falls prevention programs and poli-cies; 
(3) commends the 72 member organizations 
of the Falls Free Coalition and the falls pre-vention coalitions in 43 States and the Dis-trict of Columbia for their efforts to work together to increase education and aware-ness about preventing falls among older adults; 
(4) encourages businesses, individuals, Fed-
eral, State, and local governments, the pub-lic health community, and health care pro-viders to work together to raise awareness of falls in an effort to reduce the incidence of falls among older adults in the United States; (5) urges the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention to continue developing and evaluating interventions to prevent falls among older adults that will translate into effective community-based falls prevention programs; 
(6) urges the Administration for Commu-
nity Living, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and partners to continue to promote evidence-based programs and serv-ices in communities across the United States to reduce the number of older adults at risk for falls; 
(7) encourages State health departments 
and State Units on Aging, which provide sig-nificant leadership in reducing injuries and related health care costs by collaborating with organizations and individuals, to reduce falls among older adults; and 
(8) encourages experts in the field of falls 
prevention to share their best practices so that their success can be replicated by oth-ers.

SENATE RESOLUTION 266—DESIG-
NATING SEPTEMBER 2015 AS ‘‘NATIONAL KINSHIP CARE MONTH’’ 
Mr. WYDEN (for himself and Mr. 
H
ATCH ) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was referred to the Com-mittee on the Judiciary: 
S. R ES. 266 
Whereas in September 2015, ‘‘National Kin-
ship Care Month’’ is observed; 
Whereas nationally 2,700,000 children are 
living in kinship care with grandparents or other relatives; 
Whereas grandparents and relatives resid-
ing in urban, rural, and suburban households in every county of the United States have stepped forward out of love and loyalty to care for children during times in which bio-logical parents are unable to do so; 
Whereas kinship caregivers provide safety, 
promote well-being, and establish stable households for vulnerable children; 
Whereas kinship care enables a child— (1) to maintain family relationships and 
cultural heritage; and 
(2) to remain in the community of the 
child; 
Whereas kinship care is a national re-
source that provides loving homes for chil-dren at risk; 
Whereas kinship caregivers face daunting 
challenges to keep countless children from entering foster care; 
Whereas the Senate is proud to recognize 
the many kinship care families in which a child is raised by grandparents or other rel-atives; 
Whereas the Senate wishes to honor the 
many kinship caregivers who throughout the history of the United States have provided loving homes for parentless children; 
Whereas National Kinship Care Month pro-
vides an opportunity to urge people in every State to join in recognizing and celebrating kinship caregiving families and the tradition of families in the United States to help raise children; and 
Whereas much remains to be done to en-
sure that all children have a safe, loving, nurturing, and permanent family, regardless of age or special needs: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates September 2015 as ‘‘National 
Kinship Care Month’’; 
(2) encourages Congress to implement poli-
cies to improve the lives of vulnerable chil-dren and families; 
(3) honors the commitment and dedication 
of kinship caregivers and the advocates and allies who work tirelessly to provide assist-ance and services to kinship caregiving fami-lies; and 
(4) reaffirms the need to continue working 
to improve the outcomes of all vulnerable children through parts B and E of title IV of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), and other programs designed— 
(A) to support vulnerable families; (B) to invest in prevention and reunifica-
tion services; and 
(C) to ensure that extended family mem-
bers who take on the role of kinship care-givers receive the necessary support. AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND

LAWSUIT ABUSE REDUCTION ACT 
OF 2015 
SPEECH OF  
HON. LOIS FRANKEL 
OF FLORIDA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Thursday, September 17, 2015 
Ms. FRANKEL of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise in opposition to the so-called Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act (H.R. 758). This mis-guided bill would reinstate procedural rules that failed thirty years ago, stripping federal judges of the ability to impose the sanctions they deem appropriate for bringing frivolous lawsuits. During the ten years the old rules were in effect, judges completely lost their dis-cretion about whether or not to impose sanc-tions on attorneys and were forced to issue harsh penalties for even the smallest infrac-tions. Heavy punishments under the old sys-tem lead to endless motions that clogged our already burdened legal system, preventing ac-cess to justice. 
Moreover, had the provisions in this bill 
been law for all of the twentieth century, they would have prevented dozens of landmark civil rights cases from moving forward. Under this bill, both Brown v. Board of Education, which struck down school segregation, and Loving v. Virginia, which eliminated bans on interracial marriage, might not have made it into the courtroom. To rectify this situation, Congress in 1993 brought back the standards that existed during the Civil Rights Era, giving judges more flexibility and focusing on deter-rence, rather than punishment. H.R. 758 would undo that work by abandoning our faith in judicial prudence. We should not repeat the mistakes of the past, and we should not allow this bill to become law.

RECOGNIZING PATRICIA FRY FOR 
BECOMING A FINALIST FOR NA-TIONAL PRINCIPAL OF THE YEAR 
HON. WILLIAM R. KEATING 
OF MASSACHUSETTS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Tuesday, September 22, 2015 
Mr. KEATING. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Patricia Fry, a dedicated principal who has been selected as, not only the Massachu-setts Principal of the year, but is also a finalist for the 2015 National Principal of the Year. 
The National Principal of the Year program 
identifies exemplary principals, like Patricia, from both the middle school and high school levels across the United States who have gone above and beyond to provide the best quality educational opportunities for their stu-dents while also contributing significantly to their profession, and I can think of no one more deserving than Patricia. 
For the past 10 years, Patricia has served 
as principal at Plymouth South High School in Plymouth, Massachusetts. Prior to this posi-
tion, she has served as principal at Seekonk High School in Seekonk, Massachusetts. Be-fore rising to the position of principal, Patricia endeavored to engage and shape young minds as a Spanish teacher and an assistant principal at Barnstable High School. Addition-ally, she is an accomplished presenter at workshops and conferences geared toward educators—having presented her energizing lessons, passion for the material, and commit-ment to the students all over the country. 
Patricia is not only an educator but is also 
a lifelong learner. Though she has an under-graduate degree from Stonehill College and a Master’s degree from Bridgewater State Uni-versity, she has continued her education and is working toward completing her dissertation for a PhD from Lesley University. Her curiosity and passion for learning is a model for her students, and most importantly, is unparal-leled. 
Mr. Speaker, please join me in honoring Pa-
tricia Fry for achieving this prestigious recogni-tion. I know all my colleagues in the House join me in congratulating her and wishing her nothing but success in the future.

leagues to join me in honoring the recipients of the sixteenth annual St. Madeleine Sophie Awards, given by Sacred Heart Schools (SHS), Atherton, California. The recipients of this prestigious and highly regarded recogni-tion are individuals in the SHS community who have made a sustained and significant con-tribution to the Schools and embody the Goals and Criteria of a Sacred Heart education.

coordinator of the Senior Honors Independent Study Program at Sacred Heart Schools in Atherton, California. In his 25 years as an ed-ucator in several independent schools, Jesu ´s

missions committees; coach; dorm faculty member; peer mentor and evaluator; and cam-pus ministry. In these capacities he has gained invaluable collaborative, communica-tion, problem-solving, and strategic planning fluencies: mediating between teachers, par-ents and students; directing curriculum design; overseeing the hiring and evaluation of new 
and returning teachers; working with faculty, students, the Admissions Office and the Head of Schools on issues of equity, justice and multiculturalism; counseling students and their families through the college application proc-ess; and equally exercising his duties as coach, faculty resident and classroom teacher. Jesu´s earned his B.A. in Theology and Span-
ish Literature and his M.A. in Spanish Lit-erature from the University of Notre Dame. He resides in Menlo Park, California. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask the entire House of Rep-
resentatives to join me in honoring the extraor-dinary work and contributions of Jesu ´s Ramos

HONORING THE SERVICE OF DR. 
SANFORD L. JONES 
HON. ANDY BARR 
OF KENTUCKY  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Tuesday, September 22, 2015 
Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to rec-
ognize an outstanding individual, Dr. Sanford L. Jones, of Richmond, Kentucky. Dr. Jones, a part of the Greatest Generation, answered his nation’s call to service during World War II. 
Following the war, he had a distinguished ca-reer as an educator. Today, on his ninetieth birthday, it is my honor to recognize him be-fore the House of Representatives. 
Dr. Jones was born in Lost Creek, in Perry 
County, Kentucky. The oldest of seven chil-dren, his father worked as a coal miner and his mother taught school. When he was a sen-ior in high school, Dr. Jones was drafted into the United States Army. He served as a Staff Sergeant in the U.S. Army 15th Air Force, 304th Bombardment Wing, 455th Bombard-ment Group from 1944–1945. Dr. Jones was assigned as a nose turret gunner on a B–24 Liberator bomber. He completed 35 missions over Europe, with targets in Italy, Yugoslavia, Austria, and Germany. He was awarded the Air Medal, with three Oak Leaf Clusters to the Air Medal, for his outstanding service. 
Dr. Jones flew many important missions, but 
one stands out in particular. On March 23rd, 1944, 157 Liberators flew a raid on the Saint Valentine tank factory north of Linz, Austria. The anti-aircraft flak by the Germans was rough. In the words of Dr. Jones, ‘‘I never saw flak burst so close and so much at one time. There were flashes of fire everywhere.’’ His plane was badly damaged. After the pilot mi-raculously landed the plane, crew members counted over one hundred holes in the plane. Seven Liberators were lost on this mission, the most harrowing one of Dr. Jones’ service. 
Following the war, Jones completed high 
school and went on to earn a bachelor’s de-gree from Eastern Kentucky State College. He taught high school in Perry County before re-ceiving a master’s degree from the University of Kentucky and a doctorate from the Univer-sity of Tennessee Memphis. Dr. Jones served on the faculty of Eastern Kentucky University from 1961–1992, serving as Chairman of the Department of Biological Sciences for 13 years. Over his many years in education, he has affected hundreds of young lives. His dedication to the education field is admirable. 
The bravery of Dr. Sanford and his fellow 
men and women of the United States Army is heroic. Because of his courage and the cour-age of individuals from all across Kentucky and our great nation, our freedoms have been preserved for our generation and for future generations. He is truly an outstanding Amer-ican, a patriot, and a hero to us all.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE NEW 
BEDFORD WHALING MUSEUM AND THE WILLIAM M. WOOD FOUNDATION 
HON. WILLIAM R. KEATING 
OF MASSACHUSETTS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Tuesday, September 22, 2015 
Mr. KEATING. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the New Bedford Whaling Museum and the William M. Wood Foundation for their collaboration in celebrating the history of Cape Verdean and Azorean culture in Southeastern Massachusetts. 
Our nations’ histories are forever inter-
woven, as the ancestors of todays Azorean- and Cape VerdeanAmerican families remain an integral part of Massachusetts’ economic prosperity. Many of these immigrants were first drawn to New England’s ports on whaling and fishing vessels in the early nineteenth 
century, often finding work in the region’s nearby cranberry bogs. Cape Cod and South-eastern Massachusetts are home to the fast-est growing Cape Verdean and Azorean com-munities in the United States. 
Today, it is estimated that over 40% of the 
southeastern Massachusetts population are of Portuguese descent. The strong influence that the Cape Verdean and Azorean cultures have had on our local community cannot be under-stated, and it is essential that we honor and celebrate this important part of Southeastern Massachusetts culture. 
In keeping with this spirit the William M. 
Wood Foundation has generously approved a $300,000 grant to support the initiatives at the New Bedford Whaling Museum geared toward preserving the history of Azorean and Cape Verdean communities in Southeastern Massa-chusetts. Among other things, this grant will support a major traveling exhibit detailing the lives of Azorean and Cape Verdean whalers that will make an appearance at various coast-al communities throughout New England. Ad-ditional community events will be supported by this funding, including an international sympo-sium on the history of Azorean and Cape Verdean immigration in Massachusetts that will be held at the Museum. 
In order to ensure that Cape Verdean and 
Azorean culture is not only preserved but cele-brated in Southeastern Massachusetts, I have worked closely with many local and inter-national officials, including Cape Verdean President Jorge Carlos Fonseca, Cape Verdean Prime Minister Jose Maria Neves, and President of the Regional Government of the Azores Vasco Cordeiro. It gives me great pride to work with these individuals and to see such strong support for honoring Azorean and Cape Verdean culture in Southeastern Massa-chusetts. The funding given by the William M. Wood Foundation will establish a strong base as we move forward, and we envision many more opportunities for collaboration in the fu-ture. 
Mr. Speaker, please join me in recognizing 
the New Bedford Whaling Museum and the William M. Wood Foundation as they join to-gether to celebrate the history of Azorean and Cape Verdean culture in Southeastern Massa-chusetts. I thank my colleagues for joining me in recognition of these organizations for cele-brating such an important aspect of Massa-chusetts history.

Their commitment to the mission of a Sacred 
Heart education is a source of great inspira-tion to our entire community. This awards celebration will be held on September 23, 2015, in the Eileen Sullivan Connolly Audito-rium in the Campbell Center for the Per-forming Arts at Sacred Heart Schools in Ath-erton. 
Margaret Beltramo has given generously of 
her time, considerable talents, and devotion to the Mission of the Society of the Sacred Heart. 
Margaret was born in South San Francisco, 
California, and moved to Portola Valley when she was three months old. She attended local schools, including Portola Valley Elementary School, Notre Dame High School, and Univer-
sity of Notre Dame de Namur, Belmont. She and her husband Dan, who met at a New Year’s Eve dinner-dance in Menlo Park in 1964, have been married since 1966. They have two children, Dan, Jr. and Diana and four beautiful grandchildren, Lisa, Sara, Emily, and Thomas. 
Margaret serves her community in many ca-
pacities, and was instrumental in founding Families in Transition, an organization that served the people of East Palo Alto. She has left an indelible mark on the SHS campus, be-ginning with the Mothers’ Club, which she was President of. In the late 1970’s, she assisted the Director of Schools in a search for a new Montessori Director which brought Mary Gebhart to the position, strengthening the Montessori school immeasurably. 
In 1980, she joined the School’s first Capital 
Campaign Committee which raised over $3.5 million to build the new McGanney Gym-nasium and Sports Center in 1984. As a mem-ber of the Board of Trustees from 1981 to 1989, Margaret was involved with the painful decision to close the Boarding School and the challenging decision to make the school co-educational. These were exciting times for Sa-cred Heart, but what Margaret Beltramo is best remembered for is the establishment of the Sacred Heart Auction, a critical component of SHS’s fund raising efforts. 
Mr. Speaker, I have known and admired 
Margaret Beltramo for more than four decades and I am blessed to call her my friend. As the mothers of children who grew up together and were educated by the Religious of the Sacred Heart, I saw first-hand how her organizational skills and dedication helped to expand SHS and build for a sound future. That’s why Mar-garet Beltramo’s talents and contributions on behalf of SHS are worthy of the St. Madeleine Sophie Award. 
I ask the entire House of Representatives to 
join me in honoring the extraordinary work and contributions of Margaret Beltramo and con-gratulate her on being honored with the 2015 St. Madeleine Sophie Award. She has bettered our community and strengthened our country with all she has accomplished.

IT’S TIME TO STOP TAXPAYER 
FUNDING OF PLANNED PARENT-HOOD 
HON. BILL SHUSTER 
OF PENNSYLVANIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Tuesday, September 22, 2015 
Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, on July 14th, 
2015 pro-life activists with the group Center for Medical Progress released a video of a 
Planned Parenthood official discussing the sale of fetal body parts. There have been many other videos released since, and each one has revealed more terrible details about the reprehensible activities of this organiza-tion. When the first Planned Parenthood video was made public, I called it horrific and inhu-mane, and called for an immediate investiga-tion. Sadly, we have discovered over the last few months that this was just the beginning. With each passing day, more information comes to light illustrating that the sale and profit from fetal body parts is central to Planned Parenthood’s business model, as is the performance of abortions. The American taxpayer should not be forced to pay for this. It is time to defund Planned Parenthood, and bring a stop to these barbaric practices. This is not a Republican vs. Democrat issue. This is about protecting life and taking a stand against an inhumane activity that the people of this country are being forced to subsidize. Enough is enough. I am proud to support the Defund Planned Parenthood Act to put a mor-atorium on both mandatory and discretionary funding while Congress continues its inves-tigation, and to have been a leader on the issue of protecting life and stopping these evil practices. It is time to act, and I am hopeful that we stand for life, and end this once and for all.

RECOGNIZING THE NEW BEDFORD 
SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA FOR ITS 100TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. WILLIAM R. KEATING 
OF MASSACHUSETTS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Tuesday, September 22, 2015 
Mr. KEATING. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in 
recognition of the 100th Anniversary of the New Bedford Symphony Orchestra and in celebration of a century of music, entertain-ment and education in the arts to the public. 
The New Bedford Symphony Orchestra 
owes its establishment to Clarence Arey, a Fairhaven music teacher who founded the then-New Bedford Philharmonic Orchestra to provide quality performances of classical music for his community. It is recognized as the third oldest symphonic group in Massachu-setts and one of the first twenty established in the nation. 
Today, the Orchestra performs six sym-
phonic concerts, six chamber music concerts and a holiday Pops every year. These widely attended events are renowned as a pillar and celebration of the arts from the South Coast and beyond. Their performances enrich the lives of adults and children alike through the power of music and exposure to the fine arts. 
When Clarence Arey founded the New Bed-
ford Symphony Orchestra, he did so with a very specific goal in mind—providing his stu-dents with a place to continue practicing and growing their talents and abilities after they left the school. It is in that spirit that the Orchestra continues to offer a free music education to over 30,000 students annually. The Orchestra does this in coordination with schools in the region at all age groups—from organizing its signature programs for pre-school, elementary, and adolescent programs, including Symphony Tales, Music in the Morning, Youth Orchestras and the Strings Program. Designed to ignite a 
passion for music in future generations, the Orchestra also works with music teachers to establish and collaborate on education frame-works, and provides resources to assist in teaching their students. 
Mr. Speaker, the 100th Anniversary of the 
New Bedford Symphony Orchestra provides us with an opportunity to reflect on the signifi-cance of the fine arts in Massachusetts’—and our nation’s—history. May this historic Orches-tra continue to enrich our lives with the power of music for years to come.

H.R. 3134 AND H.R. 3504 
HON. MICHAEL R. TURNER 
OF OHIO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Tuesday, September 22, 2015 
Mr. TURNER. Mr. Speaker, today, the 
United States House of Representatives votes on two important pieces of legislation that offer us the opportunity to take a strong stance sup-porting life—H.R. 3134, the Defund Planned Parenthood Act of 2015 and H.R. 3504, the Born-Alive Survivors Protection Act of 2015. We must demand that all human beings be treated equally, with the dignity that each human life deserves. 
The right to life is one of the most funda-
mental and precious rights we enjoy as Ameri-cans. We must protect it with a degree of strength that equals its significance. Time and time again over my years in Congress, I have stood on the side of life, and I am proud to do so again today. I urge my colleagues, in the strongest terms, to do the same—to stand on the side of life.

School; St. Francis High School in Mountain 
View; and earned her bachelor’s degree in ac-counting from Santa Clara University, where she played on the women’s softball team. After graduation, Marie obtained her Certified Public Accounting license. While working for Pearson, Del Prete & Co., LLP she was given the assignment of auditing Sacred Heart Schools in Atherton. This led Marie to depart her private sector accounting and become the school’s Controller. 
Marie is a woman of many talents. She has 
inspired children to dance through her teach-ing of tap and jazz. She has hiked mountains and traversed forests as a member of the San Mateo County Sheriff’s Search and Rescue Explorer Team. Marie has helped her local business community by serving as Vice Presi-dent of the Junior Chamber of Commerce, and promoted sports by sitting on the Little League Board. She enjoys travel, reading and sports, but what means the most to Marie and brings her the greatest joy is her family, especially seeing her son Tyler transition into adulthood. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask the entire House of Rep-
resentatives to join me in honoring the extraor-dinary work and contributions of Marie VauDell and congratulate her on being honored with the 2015 St. Madeleine Sophie Award.

SAFE PLAY ACT 
HON. BILL PASCRELL, JR. 
OF NEW JERSEY  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Tuesday, September 22, 2015 
Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the first Children’s Cardiomyopathy Awareness Month this month. 
The Children’s Cardiomyopathy Foundation, 
or CCF, is a non-profit group dedicated to raising awareness for the risk of sudden car-diac arrest in the young and helping to prevent tragic deaths. 
The Children’s Cardiomyopathy Foundation 
works to raise awareness for serious cardiac conditions and provides resources and sup-ports to families struggling with the impossible reality of discovering that their young children have critical conditions. CCF’s work to bring attention to this issue and encourage better detection, prevention, and treatment for pa-tients is important, and I thank them for these efforts. I invite my colleagues to join me in congratulating this organization’s lifesaving work. 
I invite my colleagues to join me in sup-
porting H.R. 829, the Supporting Athletes, Families and Educators to Protect the Lives of Athletic Young Act, known as the SAFE PLAY Act. This legislation will provide school sys-tems with resources to raise awareness for youth athlete safety, encourage the develop-ment of best practices to prevent, report, and address injuries, and educate teachers, stu-dents, and coaches on the risks of cardio-myopathy and other critical cardiac conditions. It will also allow students to learn CPR and how to use an automated external defibrillator, or AED, to help prevent death in the event of sudden cardiac arrest. This legislation will in-crease school safety and help reduce the number of deaths from this condition on school property. RECOGNIZING THE CALL TO AC-
TION FOR WALKING AND WALKABLE COMMUNITIES 
HON. RON KIND 
OF WISCONSIN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Tuesday, September 22, 2015 
Mr. KIND. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in sup-
port of the United States Surgeon General Vivek Murthy’s Step It Up! call to action to pro-mote walking and walkable communities. 
Walking is a simple and effective way to in-
crease physical activity in the lives of every-day Americans, and it can help significantly re-duce the risk of heart disease and diabetes. An average of just 22 minutes a day of phys-ical activity can significantly mitigate many po-tential long term health issues. Fewer than half of all U.S. adults, and only a quarter of high school students, get enough physical ac-tivity to reduce their risk of chronic diseases associated with an inactive lifestyle. 
The U.S. Department of Transportation has 
found that three out of every ten Americans do not have access to sidewalks along streets in their neighborhood. I am here today to support the Surgeon General’s call on local leaders, law enforcement, and public health managers to create safe sidewalks, curbs, and cross-walks within local communities. We need to step up as a country to ensure that citizens can walk within their own communities and feel safe when they do. This call to action both encourages a shared sense of community among residents and is an effective way to mitigate many of our nation’s health care con-cerns and costs. 
As the co-chair of the Fitness Caucus, the 
Youth Sports Caucus, and the Taskforce on Childhood Obesity, I am proud to support the Surgeon General in his call to action for walk-ing and walkable communities.

VIRGINIA EPISCOPAL SCHOOL 
HON. BOB GOODLATTE 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Tuesday, September 22, 2015 
Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, nearly 110 
years ago, a church leader in Staunton, Vir-ginia envisioned a secondary school to be op-erated by the Episcopal Diocese of Southern Virginia. The Rev. Robert Carter Jett, who was the first Rector of Emmanuel Episcopal Church in Staunton, said he wanted the school to provide ‘‘leadership in the matter of education’’ for students from all means and backgrounds, with special consideration for the children of the clergy. Thanks to the work of Rev. Jett, on February 4, 1914, Virginia Episcopal School in Lynchburg, Virginia was incorporated. 
With the help of other individuals over the 
following year-and-a-half, Virginia Episcopal School opened on a 160-acre campus in Lynchburg on September 25, 1916. There were 63 young men enrolled in that first school year, the vast majority of them coming from the Commonwealth of Virginia. Rev. Jett was the school’s first Rector and was joined by five faculty members. A single building held classrooms, a chapel, a dining room, and a dormitory. 
In the century since Virginia Episcopal 
School was created, more than 4,000 young men and women have received their high school diplomas from this institution. As Rev. Jett put it, this is work that brought them ‘‘To-ward Full Stature’’ in their moral, intellectual,

spiritual, and physical lives. Those students 
have gone on to contribute to our society in a variety of ways—as business leaders, edu-cators, government officials, lawyers, doctors and nurses, and of course, the clergy. 
From its single Georgian Revival building 
designed by noted architect Frederick H. Brooke, Virginia Episcopal School has grown to include 15 buildings on campus and eight athletic fields. Of historic note, Virginia Epis-copal School became the South’s first private prep school to integrate in 1967. In 1986, the school became one of the first all-male prep schools in the South to accept females as stu-dents. 
There are 230 students enrolled for the 
2015–16 academic year at Virginia Episcopal School. They come from a much wider area than those young men from Virginia who first walked through the doors of the original school in Lynchburg. Today’s students have their homes in 20 states and foreign countries. As an important institution of learning in Vir-ginia’s Sixth Congressional District, I com-mend Virginia Episcopal School as it cele-brates 100 years of work in developing stu-dents ‘‘Toward Full Stature,’’ and I wish the school and its leaders much continued suc-cess in their worthy mission.

COMMEMORATING THE 25TH ANNI-
VERSARY OF THE U.S. AIRBORNE RECONNAISSANCE MISSION INTO BERLIN, GERMANY 
HON. DEVIN NUNES 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Tuesday, September 22, 2015 
Mr. NUNES. Mr. Speaker, Tuesday, Sep-
tember 29th marks the 25th anniversary of the last covert U.S. airborne reconnaissance mis-sion flown into Berlin, Germany, by the U.S. Air Force aircrews affectionately known as the ‘‘Berlin for Lunch Bunch.’’ From the beginning of the Cold War, these aircrews flew combat 
reconnaissance missions within the Russian- controlled airspace of the Berlin access cor-ridors and the Berlin Control Zone. From 1946 to 1990, these Airmen conducted over fifteen thousand unarmed reconnaissance flights, monitoring the massed forces of the Group Soviet Forces in Germany and the East Ger-man military. The highly modified aircraft flew low and slow over the many Soviet and East German military facilities, collecting photo-graphic and other intelligence that provided NATO the indications and warning information necessary to prepare for a Central European war. Their accomplishments are truly part of our proud American and allied intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance history, and it is my honor to acknowledge their sacrifices for all of us. 
Thank you, and well done ‘‘Berlin for Lunch 
Bunch!’’

JOHN GERMANY 
HON. KATHY CASTOR 
OF FLORIDA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Tuesday, September 22, 2015 
Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of an extraordinary leader of the Tampa Bay community, John Germany. His remarkable career in public service and his many contributions to our community are worthy of recognition by all. 
John Germany was born in 1923 in Plant 
City, Florida. As a young man, John Germany served his country in the U.S. Army as a tank commander during World War II. During the war, he led his platoon to the gates of the Ebensee concentration camp in Austria and helped liberate the camp. After the war, he graduated from Harvard Law School and re-turned to Florida to begin practicing law. 
John Germany served as the Chief Legal 
Advisor for Legislative Affairs to Florida Gov-ernor LeRoy Collins. During his tenure, he 
was an early and important supporter of es-tablishing the University of South Florida and would later go on to serve as the Board of Trustees President. John Germany’s critical role in founding the University of South Florida earned him the University Medallion for Com-munity Service in 1966 and the President’s Fellow Medallion in 2012. Today, the Univer-sity of South Florida is an economic engine in our community and top research institution in the nation. 
Not only has John Germany impacted the 
Tampa Bay community with this dedication to the law, he has also strengthened our commu-nity through his support of local organizations and his dedication to educating youth. In 1961, he was elected President of the Friends of the Library of Tampa-Hillsborough County. As President of the organization, he spear-headed efforts to fund and build a library in downtown Tampa which opened in 1966. In 
recognition of his role in founding the library, in 1999 it was named ‘‘The John F. Germany Library.’’ His excellence in his legal work and commitment to community service earned him the 2006 Outstanding Lawyer Award by the Hillsborough County Bar Association, an award given to those who excel in the areas of law and community service. Even after learning of his cancer, John Germany donated $100,000 to the library system that will con-tinue to fund the John Germany Youth Read-ing Initiative into the future. 
John Germany will be forever remembered 
as a leader in the Tampa Bay community who was passionate about the law and the advanc-ing youth education. Born into the Greatest Generation and a leader in shaping our great City of Tampa, he was a true pillar in our com-munity. On August 26th, 2015, he passed away at the age of 94. Mr. Speaker, I join the Tampa Bay community in honoring John Ger-many for his lifelong service to the State of Florida.
