PRAYER The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-fered the following prayer: Let us pray. Holy and Gracious God, let Your light shine out of darkness into our hearts. Today, fill our lawmakers with the knowledge of Your purposes, providing them with the insights to accomplish Your will. Inspire them to humble themselves under Your mighty hand so that You may exalt them in due time. Lord, keep them mindful of the great responsibility You have placed upon them, and may they trust Your power to do through them more than they can ask or imagine. Watch over and guard them and their loved ones in their going out and coming in. Lord, thank You for the loving care and tender mercies that You provide us each day. We pray in Your loving Name. Amen.

NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION BILL Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr President, our Nation faces many national security threats across the globe. The threats and challenges posed by Iran, China, Russia, North Korea, ISIL, al-Qaeda, and its affiliates represent a diverse range of conventional and asymmetric capabilities that threaten our national security and that of our allies. We also know that the challenges we face have been compounded by every-thing from sequestration to the last administration’s self-defeating foreign policy, with the Obama administra-tion’s focus on reducing the size of our conventional force only adding to the burden of our forward-deployed units. We have to be smart if we are going to address these challenges effectively and do right by our men and women in uniform appropriately. We have to provide our servicemembers with the resources and training they need. That is obvious. We have to continue the hard work of rebuilding our military and restoring combat readiness. That is ongoing. We have to modernize the Pentagon and root out waste within the military bureaucracy. That is important for strengthening accountability. We also have to prepare for the threats of both today and tomorrow by promoting defense innovation, enhanc-ing cyber security, and—especially when you consider all the recent bellig-erence from North Korea—strength-ening missile defense. For these reasons and many others, like authorizing a well-deserved raise for our servicemembers, it is impera-tive that we join together today in passing the defense authorization legis-lation before us. Mr. President, I thank the Armed Services Committee for its good work on this year’s National Defense Au-thorization Act. The members of that committee, from both parties, came to-gether to support this year’s NDAA and send it to the Senate floor. It is yet an-other testament to the leadership of Senator MCCAIN, the committee’s top Republican, and Senator R
EED, his Democratic counterpart. So thank you, Chairman M
CCAIN, thank you, Ranking Member R
EED, and thank you, everyone else, who worked so hard on this legislation. Now let’s pass it.

CONFIRMATION OF RUSSELL COLEMAN Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, on an entirely different matter, last week, the Senate confirmed a talented and experienced nominee with an impres-sive career in law enforcement to be the U.S. attorney for the Western Dis-trict of Kentucky. Russell Coleman is the right person for the job. After graduating from my alma mater, the University of Kentucky Col-lege of Law, Russell entered public service. His wide-ranging experiences at the Department of Justice, the Fed-eral Bureau of Investigation, the Sen-ate, and in private practice make him particularly qualified for this new role.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES5776 September 18, 2017 
As the chief Federal law enforcement officer for the Western District of Ken-tucky, Russell will use his skills to serve the people of Kentucky and the United States very well. Having served as a special agent with the FBI, Russell understands the particular challenges facing law enforcement. In that role, he regularly collaborated with Federal, State, and local law enforcement offi-cials on a vast array of issues, and he is well respected in the law enforce-ment community. For instance, Kentucky continues to struggle with the opioid addiction epi-demic that is tearing families and com-munities apart. Russell stands ready to collaborate with stakeholders and com-munity leaders to combat it. He has earned the support of the Kentucky Narcotics Officers’ Association, which looks forward to his leadership on drug enforcement issues. Russell also worked in my office as legal counsel, helping me serve the people of Kentucky. With good humor and an unmatched determination, he advocated for the issues that were im-portant to my constituents. The president of the Kentucky Fra-ternal Order of Police wrote to me in support of Russell’s nomination: ‘‘Rus-sell was forever thoughtful, courteous, and a true friend to our membership.’’ Now Russell has the opportunity to serve once again. I congratulate him and look forward to his service to the Commonwealth and to the country.

TRIBUTE TO NANCY KERVIN Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, on one final matter, I would like to take a brief moment to recognize a talented member of the Senate community who will be retiring this month after 20 years of service to this body and to the Nation. Nancy Kervin is a reference librarian in the Senate Library, and for years, whenever my office needed assistance with a seemingly impossible research question, she was always ready to lend a helping hand. I could not let her de-part without giving her the recognition that she so richly deserves. Nancy came to the Senate following a wide-ranging career in publishing and in research, and through her work here, Nancy has made a lasting mark. To members of my staff and to nu-merous others around the Senate, Nancy has been the first person to call when facing a difficult research ques-tion. Nancy’s signature combination of intellectual rigor and unyielding perse-verance has enabled her to skillfully complete countless research projects on numerous subjects throughout her time in the Senate, and, of course, she is widely known for her kindness and her good humor. My office has worked closely with Nancy on a number of different projects over the years, but there is one project—a project of particular personal importance to me—that I would like to mention today. A number of years ago, I began a se-ries of lectures at Kentucky colleges and universities focusing on the lives and legacies of prominent U.S. Sen-ators from the Commonwealth. Since the project’s inception, my staff has regularly looked to Nancy for help. She has been an indispensable resource for each historical speech in Kentucky that I have delivered. Her work in gathering sources and putting the in-formation in its proper context has helped me to pay tribute to many dis-tinguished Kentuckians. Therefore, it is fitting that she holds the highest honor that my State can bestow upon a civilian, that of a Kentucky colonel. After her years of dedicated service, Nancy deserves a relaxing retirement. Along with her husband, Stephen—an-other stalwart member of the Senate family who will be retiring from the Senate Historical Office—Nancy plans to spend time traveling and working in her garden. She will be sorely missed here. On behalf of the entire Senate fam-ily, I congratulate Nancy and Stephen on their successful careers in pro-moting the history and the legacy of this Chamber and those who have served in it. I wish them both happy re-tirements. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-pore. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unani-mous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-pore. Without objection, it is so or-dered.

CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-pore. Morning business is closed.

NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZA-TION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018 The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-pore. Under the previous order, the Senate will resume consideration of H.R. 2810, which the clerk will report. The legislative clerk read as follows: 
A bill (H.R. 2810) to authorize appropria-tions for fiscal year 2018 for military activi-ties of the Department of Defense, for mili-tary construction, and for defense activities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for other purposes.

NOMINATION OF MAKAN DELRAHIM  
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the nomination of Makan Delrahim as the Assistant At-torney General for the Antitrust Divi-sion of the U.S. Department of Justice. Mr. Delrahim is someone I have known for over 15 years. He is emi-nently qualified, and I have no doubt that he will make an outstanding As-sistant Attorney General. Mr. Delrahim has a long and distin-guished career within the antitrust world. His service in this area includes service as senior staffer for the Senate Judiciary Committee of the Antitrust Modernization Commission and pre-viously at the U.S. Department of Jus-tice. I could go on and on regarding Mr. Delrahim’s accomplishments, regard-ing his character and his aptitude as a lawyer, generally, and as an antitrust lawyer, in particular. But instead of taking my word for it, allow me to read just a little bit of the wide-ranging support Mr. Delrahim’s nomination has from both sides of the aisle. People within the Senate and outside the Sen-ate on both sides of the aisle have been supportive of this nomination. A bipartisan group of former Assist-ant Attorneys General for the Anti-trust Division at the Department of Justice—including AAGs for Antitrust under President Obama, President Clinton, and President Carter—sub-mitted a letter expressing strong sup-port for Mr. Delrahim’s nomination. They explained that ‘‘Mr. Delrahim has the experience, intelligence, judgment, and leadership skills necessary to serve as an excellent Assistant Attorney General.’’ Similarly, a bipartisan group of former Commissioners of the Antitrust Modernization Commission, a group of well-respected, seasoned anti-trust offi-cials, submitted a letter supporting Mr. Delrahim’s nomination. The letter said that Delrahim will ‘‘serve with high distinction and be an outstanding As-sistant Attorney General for anti-trust.’’ The authors of this letter also ‘‘strongly urge[d] the Committee to look favorably upon his nomination, with the hope that the Senate can con-firm him as soon as possible.’’ Because Mr. Delrahim is so well re-spected, his nomination is one that has enjoyed broad bipartisan support, in-cluding broad bipartisan support with-in the Senate Judiciary Committee, on which I serve. He was voted out of the committee by a vote of 19 to 1. That is not all that common these days. Rank-ing Member F
EINSTEIN went out of her way to explain that Mr. Delrahim ‘‘will fully and fairly enforce our antitrust laws.’’ Despite this strong bipartisan sup-port, Mr. Delrahim’s nomination has languished on the floor. In fact, the wait to confirm Makan Delrahim is the longest for someone appointed to this

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5777 September 18, 2017 
position in 40 years. Not since the Car-ter administration has a new adminis-tration been forced to wait this long to fill the vacancy at the Antitrust Divi-sion. President Carter’s wait was large-ly due to the fact that he took more than twice as long to nominate an As-sistant Attorney General for the Anti-trust Division than did President Trump. Apparently, some Democrats are still so eager to resist that they are unwill-ing to allow us to confirm a nominee who many of them support. This is un-acceptable. Democrats understand that antitrust is essential to ensuring that consumers receive the benefits of a competitive economy: lower prices, more innovation, and more choice. You see, when you have competition, good things happen. When you have com-petition, it inevitably brings down prices, and it inevitably results in higher quality. In fact, last month some Democrats reiterated the importance of a strong antitrust enforcement to our economy, and they did so by releasing their Bet-ter Deal plan. The Democrats’ plan de-scribes the effects that anticompetitive mergers can have, such as harming consumers, customers, and suppliers. Senator K
LOBUCHAR , along with sev-eral Democratic colleagues, followed up on this plan by proposing legislation to enact some of these policies into law. Although I don’t agree with all of their proposed solutions, I do agree with my colleagues from across the aisle that antitrust enforcement should be a priority. The best way to ensure that antitrust laws are being properly prioritized is to make sure our antitrust agencies are fully staffed and have leaders in place—leaders who have the requisite expertise and ability; leaders who have broad bipartisan support from sitting Senators, practitioners, and former agency leaders who know the position and the exacting demands required by the position; leaders who fit the de-scription of Makan Delrahim. Given his broad support, his impec-cable qualifications, and the impor-tance of this position, there is no good reason to delay this confirmation— quite to the contrary. This is a posi-tion that is neither Republican nor Democratic. It is a position that is nei-ther liberal nor conservative. This po-sition is there to advance bipartisan issues that affect every American. And Makan Delrahim in this position at a critical time in our Nation’s history, at a critical time for antitrust law—it is especially important that we have him in place. Antitrust law is an area in which the United States has excelled above and beyond what its peer nations have been able to achieve. We developed this area of the law, and we did so with an eye toward protecting consumers and com-petition itself rather than protecting individual competitors. We have to lead, and the best way we can start is by confirming Makan Delrahim. So I call upon the Senate to confirm Makan Delrahim as Assistant Attorney Gen-eral for the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-pore. The Senator from Florida. HURRICANE IRMA RECOVERY  
Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I wish to speak about the Defense bill, but be-fore I do, I want to give the Senate a report. Senator R
UBIO and I have been to-gether quite a bit this past week, as Florida has not only encountered a hurricane, but this was quite unusual in that it basically affected almost all of the State of Florida. Florida is a big State. If you went from Key West to Pensacola, it is as far as going from Pensacola all the way to Chicago. That is how big our State is. With almost 21 million people, it is the third largest State, with 75 percent of that a population along the coast. Of course, we know what happens when hurricanes start threatening those coasts. This was an unusual one because it was first going to hit the east coast of Florida. That was the track. The Na-tional Hurricane Center has gotten quite good in their ability to project the path and the velocity of the winds. But once it took an unexpected turn, hitting the north coast of Cuba as a category 5, its velocity and forward motion were reduced, and it then took a more westerly path, making landfall in the Middle and Lower Keys of Flor-ida, where the winds were category 3, approaching category 4. Residents were not even let back in to see their homes until Sunday morning. As of now, although FEMA is present in the Lower Keys—Key West—and in the Upper Keys—Key Largo—individual assistance and disaster teams were still trying to get into the areas that had the biggest impact, the areas around Big Pine Key and Marathon. It is a painfully slow process. FEMA is having to deal with the problems in Texas and now the enormity of the storm affect-ing almost all of Florida. FEMA is stretched. But FEMA is supposed to bring emergency assistance to people, organizations, and local governments in the aftermath of a natural disaster. That will be a work in progress as we go on. There are places where Senator R
UBIO and I have gotten personally in-volved in asking FEMA to come in, areas in Lee County and Collier Coun-ty. Areas where FEMA had not visited, they now have come in—Lee County, east of Fort Myers, and Lehigh Acres. The little farming community of Immokalee was exceptionally torn up. There is a great story there. The uni-versity president opened up the field-house so that a lot of the poor people in Immokalee had a place to go if they didn’t have another shelter. Indeed, they took in some 400 people. Elderly people in an apartment complex whose caregivers had left were picked up by the sheriff and taken to the university, and the students cared for them for 4 nights. This is a great example of Flo-ridians helping Floridians, which we have seen throughout. This Senator has been all over the State, much of it with my colleague, demonstrating that the two Senators, in a bipartisan way, actually get along and were there to try to help the peo-ple. First, right after the storm in the Florida Keys, we saw damage in Key West and Boca Chica. But that was the back side of the storm. The eye of the storm had gone farther to the east, so the damage was in the northeastern quadrant since the most severe winds were in the Big Pine Key and the Mara-thon area. The military, the Coast Guard, FEMA, and the engineers came in immediately after the storm. Florid-ians helping Floridians. Americans helping Americans. Then Senator RUBIO and I went to the Jacksonville area. Quite unusual was that all the extra rainfall had flowed into the St. Johns River Basin. The river had swollen, and all of that water was trying to get its normal out-let into the Atlantic Ocean at Jackson-ville. But lo and behold, the winds cov-ering up the entire peninsula moving northward, now the eye over land be-tween Tampa and Orlando and that northeastern quadrant of those winds coming from east going west—what did it do at Jacksonville? It pushed back all of the water that needed to get out into the Atlantic. That, combined with the incoming high tide—what you had was phenomenal flooding, an over-flowing of the banks of the St. Johns River in many places in the Upper St. Johns, at considerable loss of property and considerable distress to the citi-zens. A good part of downtown Jack-sonville was flooded. The next day, Senator R
UBIO and I ended up in a citrus grove in Lake Wales, FL. Fifty percent of the fruit in this citrus grove was on the ground. Farther south, 75 percent of the citrus crop was on the ground. They can’t sal-vage that. That is a huge percentage of the loss. So it made Senator R
UBIO and me all the more determined that we are going to try to pass an amendment to the Tax Code that would give the citrus growers of Florida—not only be-cause of this loss but also because of every grove now infected by a bacteria called citrus greening that will kill the tree in 5 years—that would give the citrus industry a chance to start over by plowing under the grove of those diseased citrus trees and replanting new stock that has new promise to out-last the bacteria—at least for a number of years more than the 5 years that will kill the tree—until we can find the cure, and we are working on that. But do that in the IRS Code by allowing them to expense in the first year the plowing under and replanting in order to save the citrus industry. Senator R
UBIO and I were in that grove and saw all of that lost crop. That was going to be a promising crop

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES5778 September 18, 2017 
for the first time in 10 years of declines of the citrus crop because of the bac-teria. This was going to be a good year, but we saw half of that crop on the ground in that grove, lost, gone. Citrus crop insurance is not going to really help them—only if it is a much greater loss. From there, the two of us went on to a poor part of Florida, east of Lake Okeechobee, called Belle Glade. A lot of the residences were torn up by the winds. This was a hurricane whose winds af-fected virtually all of the peninsula of Florida and even reached over into the panhandle as far as Tallahassee and even other parts west. In Belle Glade, we served a meal. Charities had come together to bring food to hungry people because they had no power and they had no refrigera-tion. It had been several days since the hurricane, and therefore they had no food. From there, we went to another very poor part of Florida, Immokalee, FL, which I described earlier, which had been torn up considerably. Whether it was what I just described or whether it was feeding poor people in Apopka, FL, who at that point had been without power for 5 days, and they had no food because there was no refrigeration, or whether it was going down to Lehigh Acres, where the Flor-ida National Guard had organized the distribution of MREs, which are meals ready to eat, and gallons of fresh water because so many of those homes out in Lehigh Acres, east of Fort Myers, were on water wells, and without electricity, there were no pumps to give them water—there are so many things that we often take for granted. If power is taken away, you suffer not only be-cause of the 90 degree-plus heat and hu-midity but also because you can’t even get any water because you are on a water well. It was a privilege to be there with the Florida National Guard, handing out food, handing out water, and talk-ing to those local residents who are liv-ing paycheck to paycheck—and now they have no paycheck. Where is the FEMA assistant to help them? Because there is no power, they can’t go online to apply for individual assistance. In fact, they can’t pick up the phone be-cause of the intermittent cell service. Even if they could get a cell signal, they couldn’t get through to the FEMA number. That is why we wanted the FEMA representatives to come in, and fortunately, just yesterday, they fi-nally did come in. It has been quite a couple of weeks— first, anticipating the storm coming in and getting all of the emergency oper-ation centers ready. Fortunately, peo-ple obeyed the evacuation orders. It was estimated that out of the popu-lation of almost 100,000 in the Keys, there were only 10,000 left. That was a huge evacuation. Those folks did not get in to find out what was left of their homes until yesterday. You can imag-ine, a week after the storm had hit— the weekend before the Keys—all of that water was in there, setting in with the heat and the humidity, the mold and the mildew. You can imagine the mess, the cleanup. All the while, FEMA has to worry about Texas, now Florida, and maybe another hurricane that is going to come up. It looks as though it is going to turn out to sea but is still going to have some of the wind effects along the northeast Atlantic Coast. Floridians helping Floridians—and then there was a great, great tragedy that occurred 4 days after the hurri-cane. Why there is not a requirement that every nursing home or assisted living facility, an ALF, have a gener-ator not only for power, for lights, but have a generator capacity that will run air conditioning units—I think this is going to be the subject of great debate that I hope will change that require-ment in the State of Florida because eight people died. Eight people died in a nursing home right across the street from a major hospital in Hollywood, FL—eight frail elderly, from ages 70 to 99—eight needless deaths as a result. A criminal investigation is underway. All the phone calls that had been made that were not answered, both to the government as well as to the power company, as reported by the press, spe-cifically a Miami television station— we don’t know all the facts; they will come out in the criminal investigation. But it is inexcusable that eight frail, elderly people would die from heat ex-haustion by being left so that their condition deteriorated over the course of 3 or 4 days. What is wrong with a regulatory scheme that does not have a backup generator that would kick in when, in fact, the hospital right across the street had one? What was the dis-connect there? Why did it take days and days until 911 was called? We will find out in this great tragedy. I can tell you, the Miami Herald had done a series, over the last couple of years, of three investigative pieces, which pointed out that these ALFs and these nursing homes had not been prop-erly managed or regulated by the State of Florida. That is to be determined. Hurricane Irma is just another re-minder that we are going to confront huge natural occurrences and maybe, just maybe, people will realize there is something to the fact that the Earth is getting hotter. Because of that, two- thirds of the Earth is covered by oceans, with the oceans absorbing 90 percent of that heat. What happens to water when it is heated? It expands. Thus, the sea levels are rising. Mr. President, as we turn to this De-fense bill, this is an issue of national security. As Secretary of Defense Mattis has said, ‘‘Climate change is im-pacting stability in areas of the world where our troops are operating today.’’ Maybe we should pay attention to issues like those I have just described in Florida or maybe in Texas. Or what about tornadoes causing damage to military depots in Georgia? Or what about the severe heat canceling mili-tary training and hail storms dam-aging aircraft in Texas? What about the coastal erosion, not only in Florida but also threatening early-warning radar in Alaska? What about the wildfires causing ranges to be closed and the flooding that we saw in not only Texas but also the flooding dam-aging military logistics rail in Lou-isiana and affecting warehouses con-taining hazardous materials in Vir-ginia? That is why, in this version of the Defense bill that we will pass today, there is a provision that this Senator had something to do with, which calls for the Defense Department to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the threats to the training and readiness of our Armed Forces and the military in-frastructure caused by climate-related events. It is critical that we recognize the threat so we will ensure that our forces and installations are resilient enough to withstand and quickly recover from all of these natural disasters that we have been talking about. Not only must we ensure that our military in-frastructure is resilient, we must also ensure that it provides our warfighters with the space they need to train and the technology they need to stay ahead of our adversaries. I have opined on this subject over and over in speeches to the Senate. I have opined over and over about the Gulf Test and Training Range that the Air Force needs to make huge invest-ments in for the precise measurements of all of our sophisticated weapons and our systems. I thank Chairman M
CCAINand Rank-ing Member R
EEDfor their good work on the bill. It begins to address some of the training and readiness shortfalls in our military. I look forward to con-tinuing to discuss this. I yield the floor. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER  
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-pore. The Democratic leader is recog-nized. 
THANKING THE SENIOR SENATOR FROM FLORIDA  
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, let me once again thank my friend and col-league from Florida. There is no one— no one—who has defended his State more diligently, more assiduously, more effectively than the senior Sen-ator from the State of Florida. I know there are close to 20 million people in Florida who are grateful, as are all of us. Thank you. Mr. President, we will vote today on the final passage of NDAA. I am pleased with the bipartisan manner in which the Senate has worked on this important legislation. Senators M
CCAIN and R EED managed the bill with great skill. I commend them for their bipartisan work on this impor-tant legislation.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5779 September 18, 2017 
HEALTHCARE  
Mr. President, I am going to use the rest of my time to address something that is not so bipartisan. It is terribly partisan, and that is the issue of healthcare. I hope the American people listen closely. After a few months of lying dormant, TrumpCare is back, and it is meaner than ever. TrumpCare now lives under the name of Cassidy-Graham. Guess what. It is another bill that would drastically cut back on healthcare funding for Americans who need it most. My colleagues, my fellow Americans, this is a red-alert moment for the en-tire country. Our healthcare system again is threatened by a hastily con-structed piece of legislation, put to-gether in a back room by only one party—no CBO score, no committee process, not a single hearing. Everyone is totally in the dark about the effects of this bill, yet there is an effort to rush it forward. This Frankenstein monster of a bill that would harm so many Americans keeps coming back and back, and somehow each time it has managed to get worse. Here is what we know the new TrumpCare bill would do. It would roll back protections for Americans with preexisting conditions. It would allow States to impose burdensome require-ments as a condition on Medicaid cov-erage. It would defund Planned Parent-hood, stripping millions of women of their right to access affordable healthcare. Most crucially, the new TrumpCare would plunge a dagger deep into the heart of Medicaid, imme-diately ending Medicaid expansion and establishing a per capita cap on Med-icaid spending. That jeopardizes cov-erage for 11 million Americans and puts at great risk the coverage and af-fordability of insurance for the 12 mil-lion who buy insurance on the market-places. It would take the money used for Medicaid expansion and subsidies and block-grant it to the States, imposing a massive cut on funding that helps so many Americans well into the middle class. The term ‘‘block grants’’ may sound harmless, but in practice they are any-thing but. Right now, our healthcare system reimburses States for the costs of what their citizens actually need and use. Block grants are a fixed amount of money given to each State, forcing people who need healthcare to fight among each other as to who gets those dollars. People with parents in nursing homes will fight with those on opioid treatment, who will fight with those who have kids with preexisting conditions, who will fight with those who simply need to go see a doctor. They will all be pitted against one an-other in a heartless scheme, a heartless scheme that will hurt so many. Block grants are a not-so-clever way of disguising a massive, massive cut to healthcare—cutting back care, raising premiums, hurting millions and mil-lions of average Americans. That is the case with this new TrumpCare. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities took a look at the new TrumpCare and found that the block grants in the bill would deprive States of hundreds of millions and sometimes billions of dollars. I am going to mention a few States here. My colleagues should know the effect of the bill. They don’t. CBO has told us—I will talk more about this later—that they cannot give us a full score but simply notes wheth-er it meets the budget reconciliation numbers. They say it will cut a billion dollars. That is all it will say. We will not know how many citizens are hurt, but the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, whose numbers are very re-liable, has done a calculation. I would ask my colleagues to pay attention. I just picked out some States. There are more. Arizona would lose $1.6 billion in Federal funding. Alaska would lose $255 million in Federal funding. Maine would lose $115 million in Federal fund-ing. West Virginia would lose $554 mil-lion in Federal funding. Colorado would lose $823 million in Federal funding. Ohio, the State most racked by the opioid epidemic, would lose over $2.5 billion in healthcare funding. Iowa would lose $525 million in Federal fund-ing. These are devastating numbers. My colleagues, if you don’t believe the accuracy of these numbers, then have the courage and decency to wait for a CBO score. To pass this legislation be-fore CBO measures out the effect on your State would be legislative mal-practice of the highest order. These numbers, we believe, are accurate. They come from a group that has had years of expertise and accurately pre-dicted healthcare effects. There will be devastating cuts to so many in so many States. If you don’t believe these numbers, then show us what yours are. Wait for CBO, an impartial arbiter, and see what they have to say. The numbers are devastating. They represent mil-lions of Americans, especially middle- income and low-income, who will re-ceive poorer healthcare, face higher costs, or both. Whom do they rep-resent? You are an American family—a nice, middle-class family making a good income. You have a parent in a nursing home. It is likely to be paid for by Medicaid. That parent is at risk if this Graham-Cassidy bill passes. You have a young son or daughter afflicted by opioids. The treatment they receive would often be at risk if this bill passes. You give birth to a child with a preexisting condition who desperately needs help. We met so many of these families, every one of us. That child’s life, in many cases, would be at risk if this bill passes. This is the poorest way of legislating I have seen in all my years here. To try to rush this bill through with no hearings, no CBO score, no knowledge of how it actually affects your constituents—how can we do that? Already, some Republican Governors have spoken out against this legisla-tion. Governor Kasich, Governor Baker, and 16 patient and provider groups have come out against this TrumpCare, including the American Cancer Society and the American Heart Association. The ratings agency Fitch says Graham-Cassidy would be even ‘‘more disruptive’’ than all the other ACA bills. The American people have rejected TrumpCare repeatedly. Its numbers in the polls are below 20 percent. Hardcore supporters of Donald Trump do not want us to pass this bill. Virtually only one in five Americans wants us to pass this bill—hardly any-body—and we are going to go do it for a political scalp? No, we can’t. I know there are some on the other side of the aisle who say they can work it out so each State wouldn’t be hurt as badly as under the current draft of the bill—these bad numbers—that they can tweak the formula for one State or an-other that would make the cuts less devastating. First, they are never going to come up with that kind of money. I heard one Governor was told by a Senator: Don’t worry about the big cuts to your State. We will make it up with disproportionate share pay-ments—uncompensated care. It is im-possible. The amount of money in the DSH Program is so much less than the amount of these cuts that we couldn’t even come close. That is what is being thrown around here. There are lots of different surmises: Maybe we will do this, maybe we will do that. We are playing with people’s lives. That is so wrong. States will end up facing a harsh cut—most of the States in the Union—many States represented by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who voted for the previous bills. We shouldn’t do it on substance, but we also shouldn’t do it on the basis of regular order. To have such a major bill that affects so many people be rushed at the last minute in the dark of night—no discussion, no analysis, no real knowledge of how it affects each of our States—is legislative malpractice of the highest order. If the Founding Fathers were looking at this Chamber now and watching, they would be turning over in their graves. An America founded on debate and discussion and sunlight is veering off all of that in a really nasty way. There is no regular order here. There are no bipartisan public hearings on the Graham-Cassidy bill. The HELP and Finance Committees are not debat-ing the legislation. It is the same back-room, one-party sham of a legislative process that ultimately brought the previous bill down. A contrived, elev-enth-hour hearing on block grants in the Homeland Security Committee—a committee that has very little jurisdic-tion over healthcare matters—does not even come close to suggesting regular order. In conclusion, I think many of us on both sides of the aisle thought there was a ray of light in the last few

weeks. The partisanship that had gov-erned this place for the last 8 months seemed to be breaking. I had good meetings in the White House—hopes of working together. Senators A
LEXANDER  and M
URRAY began talking about how we move forward. I was joyful that maybe the partisanship could end and we could work together. The majority leader and I are getting along very well. This bill, if done this way and passed, would dash those hopes. There is a way out. Senators A
LEX-
ANDER and M URRAY have had hearings. They have had discussions. They are negotiating at this moment. What they will come up with will have some things I don’t like and some things people on the other side of the aisle don’t like. That is the legislative proc-ess. It is not to rush a bill through in the dark of night without even knowl-edge of how it affects people. CBO has said they cannot measure how many people would lose coverage and how they would be affected until a few weeks because this is a block grant. It takes a long time to weigh it. So after 2 weeks of thinking biparti-sanship—that flickering candle might gain some new light—this is the last thing we need. Let’s not go back to the divisive, destructive healthcare process that paralyzed the Senate for much of this year. Let the leader and I encour-age our Members to talk to one an-other and come up with bipartisan so-lutions—not just on this bill but on bills to come. Let’s pursue the bipar-tisan path courageously used by Sen-ators A
LEXANDER and M URRAY . In conclusion, I would ask every American who hears these words, who longs for us to work together, to call your Senators and Congressmen and let them know. Tell them this bill is even worse than the previous bills. Tell them it hurts average families dra-matically. Tell them there is a better way. The same level of activism that we saw on the previous bills must be garnered now or this will just slide through in the dark of night, with ef-fects that are desperate, devastating, and unknown. Democrats in the Sen-ate, we have no choice. Our constitu-encies, our consciousness impels us. We will oppose the Graham-Cassidy bill in every way we can, using every tool at our disposal, and we ask the American people to speak out, once again, and make their voices heard. The hour is late, and the need is desperate. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. E
RNST ). The Senator from Maryland. Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Presi-dent, I first thank the Democratic leader for his efforts to work and reach out to the Republican leader, Senator M
CCONNELL , as we move forward to try to take some sensible steps to improve our healthcare system, not try to blow up the entire healthcare system. Just last month, the overwhelming majority of the American people sighed a great sigh of relief when this Senate voted down the earlier TrumpCare pro-posal that would have destroyed the Affordable Care Act and which would have had a devastating impact on the entire American healthcare system. We all recall, at that point in time, Senator MCCAINgave a powerful and impassioned speech on this floor about the importance of the Senate going through the regular order, about work-ing in a transparent way, in a bipar-tisan way, to improve and strengthen our healthcare system—not another cynical, partisan effort to ram through a piece of legislation that impacts hun-dreds of millions of our fellow Ameri-cans. For a time, it seemed we were making headway on that front. Sen-ator L
AMAR ALEXANDER and Senator P
ATTY MURRAY and the HELP Com-mittee are working together, holding hearings, bringing people from all points of view in front of that com-mittee to testify about how we can im-prove and strengthen our current sys-tem. Now, instead of heading down that bipartisan path, we are seeing another last-ditch effort to destroy the Afford-able Care Act and, in the process, wreak incredible damage to our entire healthcare system. The latest incarna-tion of TrumpCare is the Graham-Cas-sidy legislation. Make no mistake, in many ways, this is far worse than the earlier proposals we have seen. It would end the Medicaid expansion program, which in my State of Mary-land actually has provided more afford-able care to more Marylanders than the exchanges that were established under the Affordable Care Act. It will dramatically cut the funds under the Medicaid Program through a block grant proposal that gives very little, given the huge responsibilities that the State has. It will give a green light to States throughout the country to eliminate the really important patient protec-tions, protections against discrimina-tion based on preexisting conditions like diabetes or asthma or whatever it may be, and it will give a blank check to those who want to eliminate the im-portant essential benefit provisions that provide important coverage guar-antees for women’s health and so many other important areas like mental health and substance abuse. Doctors in this country take a very simple oath, the Hippocratic oath, which says: First, do no harm. This piece of legislation—this latest incarnation of TrumpCare—will do dev-astating harm to our healthcare sys-tem, and you don’t have to take my word for it. As more and more groups learn about this piece of legislation— and they are just looking at the de-tails—they are beginning to phone into our offices and to send us emails and texts. I can assure you that Members will see the same outpouring of opposi-tion to this bill that they saw to the earlier ones. Already we have seen strong state-ments of opposition from the American Cancer Society, the American Diabetes Association, the American Heart Asso-ciation, the American Lung Associa-tion, and the list goes on and on, and it just started. It is important for us to remember that these are not Republican groups. They are not Democratic groups. They have no partisan affiliation at all. Their only interest is to protect pa-tients in this country, and we should have the same interest in protecting the health of our constituents. It is not just the patient advocacy groups that are already strongly op-posed to this. Those who provide healthcare in our system to our loved ones—to our parents, to our children— are coming out strongly opposed to this already. Here is what the Children’s Hospital Association has to say about the Gra-ham-Cassidy provision: 
Their legislation would slash funding for Medicaid, the nation’s largest health care program for children, by one-third, reducing access and coverage for more than 30 million children in the program. Furthermore, the legislation weakens important consumer safeguards, and as a result, millions of chil-dren in working families would no longer be assured that their private insurance covers the most basic of services without annual and lifetime limits. . . . 
And they go on. That is the Chil-dren’s Hospital Association. Those are the hospitals that every day are caring for kids throughout this country, and they are not alone in already opposing this legislation. The American Academy of Family Physicians, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Physicians, the American Nurses Asso-ciation—in short, all of those organiza-tions representing all those people out there who are providing healthcare to our fellow Americans, to our constitu-ents—are opposed to this bill. AARP, which, of course, represents millions—in fact, tens of millions—of older Americans is strongly opposed to this bill because, once again, it opens the door toward age discrimination in the amount of the premiums that are charged. Older Americans and elderly Americans will see their premiums go through the roof under this proposal, and that is why AARP is also strongly opposed. So just when we thought we were at a point where we were going to focus on a bipartisan basis on improving our healthcare system, which has a whole lot of room for improvement, just when we began to see bipartisan hearings and legislation possibly emerge from the HELP Committee, we now see this last-ditch effort on the floor of the Senate to do what other bills had tried to do but in an even worse fashion. We are hearing already from Ameri-cans—not with political hats on, not with Republican hats on or Democratic hats on or Independent hats on, not with political hats on at all, just peo-ple who care about the healthcare of the people of this country—and they are resoundingly opposed to this. So let’s not try and ram something

through here in the next 2 weeks to try to meet an artificial clock that has been set by the rules of the Senate. There has been ample time to debate this, and we have debated the earlier versions. Let’s not allow this final sneak attack on the American healthcare system to get through this body. It would be a very sad day for the Senate. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Indiana. Mr. YOUNG. Madam President, I rise today to discuss the National Defense Authorization Act. I want to begin by thanking Senators M
CCAINand R EED, the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. I commend their continued bipartisan leadership and collaboration on behalf of our servicemembers and our na-tional security. As someone who served in the U.S. Marine Corps and also served on the House Armed Services Committee, I understand the importance of Congress’s fulfilling its constitutional duties to our men and women in uni-form. This legislation is important for our country. It is also important to my neighbors. That includes Hoosiers serv-ing on Active Duty, in the Reserves, and in the Indiana National Guard, as well as their families. It also helps Hoosiers working at Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane, Crane Army Ammunition Activity, and Defense Fi-nance and Accounting Service in Indi-anapolis to perform their important work, which is essential to our service-members. Now, for the last 55 years, Congress has passed the NDAA. Given the threats our country confronts, it is im-portant that we once again pass this legislation and provide our troops with the training, weapons, and support they need to accomplish their missions and return home safely. But that is not enough. Congress must pass Defense author-ization and appropriations bills before the end of the fiscal year, stop the ha-bitual use of continuing resolutions for the Department of Defense, and end de-fense sequestration once and for all. I stand ready to work with Senators of both parties to achieve these objec-tives. I am committed to doing my part, and that is why I voted to end debate on this legislation last week and why I will support further advancing the bill today, despite the fact that we weren’t able to debate and vote on amendments here on the floor. Today, I will only note that I have introduced a couple of bipartisan amendments related to Saudi Arabia’s actions in Yemen. These are amend-ment Nos. 585 and 1081. I believe this issue deserves consideration by the full Senate, and I look forward to speaking at length on this issue again in coming days. I share the frustration of Chairman M
CCAINand Ranking Member R EEDre-garding the lack of floor debate and substantive votes, and I hope the Sen-ate can do better next year. I think each Senator, the Americans we rep-resent, and the troops who protect us are right to expect better. Now, with that said, I applaud Chairman MCCAIN and Ranking Member R
EEDfor working to include over 100 noncontroversial amendments in this bill. I am proud of the fact that the De-fense bill we are going to vote on—and, hopefully, pass—this evening includes three amendments important to Hoo-siers that I introduced and for which I worked with the committee to include. I would like to quickly mention two of them and then spend a little more time on the third. The first provision is amendment No. 793. This provision would press the De-partment of Defense to implement Government Accountability Office rec-ommendations or explain why they aren’t doing so. Now, let me explain why this is so important. Our Nation confronts chal-lenges and threats of extraordinary scope. Yet the resources we have are limited. That means we need to ensure that the Department of Defense is op-erating as efficiently and as effectively as possible with the money the tax-payers provide. That is what our na-tional security demands and what U.S. taxpayers are right to expect. So when a respected organization such as the GAO, our Federal Govern-ment’s auditor, conducts independent and rigorous analysis and identifies key areas for improvement within DOD, Congress and the Pentagon should take it seriously. Here is the problem. As of this morn-ing, there were 1,008 open GAO rec-ommendations, including 75 priority recommendations that DOD alone has failed to address fully. Now, some of these priority recommendations relate to missile defense, ship maintenance, military readiness, servicemember healthcare, and financial management, and some of these open recommenda-tions go back to 2009 and even earlier. There may be a few of these rec-ommendations in which DOD has a per-suasive justification for not imple-menting GAO’s recommendation, but I believe the burden of proof should be on DOD to either implement GAO’s recommendations without delay or jus-tify to Congress why they believe the recommendation should not be adopt-ed. That is essentially what my provi-sion would do. I look forward to working with the leaders and staff of the Armed Services Committees to ensure that this impor-tant provision is included in the final legislation. I would also like to highlight a sec-ond amendment, amendment No. 882, that I introduced and worked to in-clude in the bill that we will soon vote to adopt. This provisions would require the Navy to conduct and provide to Congress a comprehensive review of U.S. maritime intelligence, surveil-lance, reconnaissance, and targeting capability, also known as ISRT. In light of growing Chinese and Rus-sian maritime capabilities, this report would require the Navy, among other things, to identify specific capability gaps and specific areas of risk when it comes to ISRT, as well as offer solu-tions and resources that are needed to address those capability gaps and areas of risk. The review will help to ensure that the United States retains the naval supremacy necessary to keep vital shipping lanes open, deter aggres-sion, and defend our national security interests. Now, lastly, I would like to highlight amendment No. 821. I introduced it and worked with the committee to include this in the bill, and I want to thank Senator D
ONNELLY for cosponsoring my amendment. On January 27, the President issued a memorandum that emphasized the need for a ‘‘modern, robust, flexible, re-silient, ready, and appropriately tai-lored nuclear deterrent.’’ This memo-randum reiterated the longstanding and bipartisan consensus that deter-ring a nuclear attack on our country and on our allies depends on our ability to maintain a strong, nuclear deter-rent. Our nuclear deterrent includes three legs, also referred to as the nuclear triad, consisting of submarine- launched ballistic missiles, land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles, and long-range bomber aircraft. Now, each of these legs offers an important and complementary capability making clear to any potential aggressor that a nuclear attack on the United States would be suicidal and, thereby, deter-ring such an attack in the first place. Perhaps that is why Secretary of De-fense Mattis, referring to the deter-rence of potential aggressors, said just last week: ‘‘If I wanted to send the most compelling message, I have been persuaded that the triad . . . is the right way to go.’’ Now, the challenge is that, in just the next two decades, essentially all of our Nation’s nuclear delivery systems and all of our nuclear weapons will need to be refurbished or replaced. According to a February 17 study by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, that could cost a total of $400 billion over the next decade. That is an enormous cost during a period when our Department of Defense has many other modernization bills coming due. Consequently, we must identify oppor-tunities to minimize costs while not sacrificing capability. So consistent with that fact, on Jan-uary 31, Secretary Mattis issued a memorandum calling for an ‘‘ambi-tious reform agenda, which will include a horizontal integration across DOD components to improve efficiency and take advantage of economies of scale.’’ Consistent with that memorandum and the memorandum of the President, my amendment would require the Of-fice of the Secretary of Defense, work-ing with our Navy and Air Force, to

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES5782 September 18, 2017 
submit a report to Congress on the po-tential to achieve more value; that is, enhanced nuclear deterrence at a lower cost by integrating elements of acqui-sition programs related to moderniza-tion and sustainment of the nuclear triad. If we can improve efficiency and pro-gram management, cost, and schedule by increasing integration, colocation, and commonality between the stra-tegic deterrent programs of the Navy and the Air Force and their associated systems, technologies, and engineering processes, then we should do so. Back home in Indiana, the skilled workers at Naval Surface Warfare Cen-ter Crane have supported the Navy Strategic Systems Program for more than 60 years. Crane is the largest DOD supplier to the Strategic Systems Pro-gram. Crane provides the Navy’s only organic high-reliability, radiation- hardening capability. Crane also serves as a leader in trusted microelectronics. What is less well known is that Crane provides important support to the Air Force’s ICBM Ground Based Strategic Deterrent Program. More importantly, there is good reason to believe that Crane can dramatically increase its level of support to the Air Force’s stra-tegic programs. That is the kind of joint collabora-tion between the Air Force and the Navy my amendment envisions. By breaking down stovepipe barriers be-tween our military services, by elimi-nating unnecessary duplication, and by looking for commonsense opportunities for joint cooperation, we can keep our country safe and save money in the process. That is not only a win for Crane, it is a win for the Navy, it is a win for the Air Force, it is a win for taxpayers, and it is a win for the safety and security of every American. That is why I look forward to work-ing with the leadership and staff of the Armed Services Committee to include this amendment in the final bill. I thank Chairman M
CCAINand Rank-ing Member R
EED for their work and tireless leadership on the Senate Armed Services Committee and for your work to bring the National De-fense Authorization Act to this point. Madam President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Arkansas. Mr. COTTON. Madam President, I want to clarify something about what is going to happen this afternoon. Whenever a Democratic Senator says they are worried about the state of our military, that they are horrified about the kind of cuts we are making, and they can’t sleep at night because of what we are doing to our troops in the field, don’t believe them. They don’t mean it. They are not serious. It is all for show because they had a perfect op-portunity to stop all of these terrible cuts—and not just for the troops, for their own State, for their constituents, even for their little parochial projects. What did they do? They turned it down. They said no. Well, actually I take that back. They didn’t say no. They couldn’t even bring themselves to say no. They didn’t have the courage to say no. They did some-thing much worse. They said nothing because we are not even going to vote on the amendment I wanted to offer, which would have repealed the seques-ter spending cuts for defense and non-defense—defense and nondefense spend-ing. Now, the Members of this body know I am no fan of frivolous, pork-barrel spending. A lot of the projects that my Democratic colleagues sponsored could easily fall in that category, and we should rein that sort of thing in at a time when we are $20 trillion in debt, but I understand the only way we were going to get something done about the radical spending cuts to our military was to forge a bipartisan compromise. After all, it is not like the sequester spending cuts really did that much to control spending. Did spending go down in 2011, 2012, 2013? Yes, it went from $3.6 trillion to $3.5 trillion, to $3.4 trillion, but the sequester wasn’t even in effect for those first 2 years. Spending went down because Republicans won control of the House in 2010. At the end of 2013, however, Congress raised the budget caps and pushed off the sequester for those 2 years ahead. So, by 2015, Fed-eral spending was back to $3.6 trillion, and it has been growing ever since. Time and time again, Congress has proven itself utterly incapable of stick-ing to the caps under the Budget Con-trol Act of 2011. Instead of actually saving money, all the sequester does is create an endless series of crises for Congress to escape just in the nick of time. Take this year. We all know what is going to hap-pen. We just passed a 3-month con-tinuing resolution earlier this month. We are going to reach a 2-year budget agreement in October or November that doesn’t control spending. We are going to have an omnibus in December, written in secret in our leaders’ offices, and then we are going to have another omnibus spending bill, written in se-cret in our leaders’ offices, next De-cember, and we will repeat that cycle over again in 2019 and 2020. How do I know that? Because that is exactly what happened in 2013 and 2015. We will never make the cuts the Budget Con-trol Act called for. We will just pass giant budgets that nobody has read in the last minute in an attempt to avoid the crisis of our own making. My amendment was the last best chance in years to stop this bust-and- boom cycle of budgeting. But what did the Democrats do? They threw it away. They took a perfectly good, bipartisan opportunity to repeal these automatic spending cuts, and they threw it away. You have to ask yourself what goes through Senators’ heads when they make such a cynical political calculus. Do they not understand the implica-tions of what they are doing? Do they not see the appalling lack of readiness that is so apparent to everyone else? Did they not see what happened to the USS John McCain? Did they not see what happened to the USS Fitzgerald? Did they not see all those caskets car-rying the dead bodies of America’s young coming home to families in grief? Do they not see them or do they see them and just not care? What do they think when they hear respected men like Secretary Jim Mattis say: ‘‘No enemy in the field has done more to harm the readiness of our military than sequestration’’? What did they think when Secretary Mattis said, after 4 short years of re-tirement, when he returned to the De-partment of Defense, ‘‘I have been shocked by what I’ve seen about our readiness to fight’’? Is it just background noise? Does it not register with Democratic Senators? In fact, what must they think when they have been saying the exact same thing for years? The junior Senator from Connecticut said: ‘‘The so-called sequester is an-other example of governing at its worst.’’ The junior Senator from New Jersey said: ‘‘It is blunt, brutal, and blind.’’ He gets bonus points for alliteration. The senior Senator from Virginia: ‘‘Sequestration is stupidity on steroids.’’ I could make that claim about a lot of things that have been said in this Chamber. The senior Senator from Washington: ‘‘We need to replace sequestration as quickly as possible’’; although, appar-ently, not if it requires a vote on the Cotton amendment. The junior Senator from Minnesota: ‘‘There are a lot of people suffering needlessly because of the sequester.’’ That is not a joke, even coming from him. I guess all of these cries of an-guish are falling on deaf ears. The senior Senator from New Hamp-shire: ‘‘The blind cuts of sequestration are not the right approach,’’ but by all means, let’s keep them in place rather than vote on the Cotton amendment. The senior Senator from Con-necticut: ‘‘The safety and strength of our Nation also requires that Congress eliminate the rightly maligned seques-tration straightjacket for all Federal programs’’—maligned, yet not re-pealed. My favorite is by the senior Senator from Rhode Island, the senior Demo-crat on the Armed Services Com-mittee: ‘‘Instead of dodging fiscal re-sponsibility, Republicans need to help end sequestration and get back to a normal budget process.’’ Republicans gave you a perfect exam-ple with which to do that, sir, and you turned it down. That is what this amendment would have done, but now we will not have a single dime more for the military. We will not give a dime more to FEMA or to the National Weather Service or to NOAA or to NASA or what have you. We will not give one penny more to all of those domestic priorities that the

Democrats claim to care about. It turns out that they must not care that much about them or maybe I am being too harsh. Maybe they do like them a lot. They like using them to gin up po-litical support because, when the time came for them to actually put their money where their mouths were, they walked away. The Democrats will tell you that they oppose this amendment because it will not repeal the automatic sequester of mandatory spending. Don’t give me that. That is nonsense. That is pure pretext. The automatic sequester con-sists of a small, almost trivial number of cuts, and it would not have affected one penny—not one penny—of Social Security or Medicare or veterans’ bene-fits. Here is what is most important. Every single Democratic Senator has voted to extend that mandatory se-quester into the foreseeable future. So, far from thinking it is a problem, they have voted to extend its life. Hey, how about I strike a new deal? Here is my offer. I will support your hiding behind procedural niceties, hid-ing in your cloakroom, and not voting on my amendment, if you will agree to do one thing—to go home, in person, to your military bases that are in your home States and explain to the men and women of our Armed Forces, face- to-face, why you could not bring your-selves not just to repeal these spending cuts but not even to be tough enough to take a vote one way or the other. The Democratic leader can go to New York and tell the men and women of the 10th Mountain Division at Fort Drum. The Democratic whip can go to the Naval Station Great Lakes. The senior Senator from Rhode Is-land—the senior Democrat on the Armed Services Committee—can go to the Naval War College. The senior Senator from Missouri can go to the 131st Bomb Wing. The junior Senator from New York can go to the soldiers at Fort Drum as well. The senior Senator from New Hamp-shire can go to the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. The junior Senator from Hawaii can go to the dozen different military bases in Hawaii, while the senior Senator from Florida can go to 20 different military installations in his State. The senior Senator from Connecticut can go to the Groton submarine base. The senior Senator from Indiana can go to AM General in South Bend, whose manufacturing he always touts for political purposes. The junior Senator from Virginia can go to Norfolk or the Pentagon or Fort Myer or to any one of the numerous bases in Virginia. The junior Senator from Maine can go to Bath Iron Works. The junior Senator from New Mexico can go to the Kirtland and Cannon Air Force Bases. The junior Senator from Michigan can go to General Dynamics, outside Detroit. Also, the senior Senator from Massa-chusetts could shake hands with all 115,563 of the people in her State whose jobs are directly tied to defending our Nation. Every one of those Democrats who sits on the Armed Services Committee and has claimed to want to stop these automatic spending cuts can go home and tell the men and women in uniform in his State that he had a chance to vote on it and that he was too cowardly to even put his name on the rolls. He can look at all of these Americans in the eye and say: Sorry, just poli-tics—hope you understand. That is all this is. It is politics of the lowest kind. In maneuvering, pos-turing, and posing, they are caving to the demands of the Democratic leader simply because he wants more leverage for more pork-barrel spending when we had a budget deal that was negotiated in secret in December. He twisted their arms, and they screamed like little kids. They are putting politics ahead of our troops. They are holding our troops hostage to politics solely because their leader wants them to. If they were not, they would allow a vote on this amendment. They would vote aye. They would vote aye eagerly, and they would vote aye enthusiasti-cally, but they cannot even do that. They cannot even put their names down as a yes or a no on something that they have all said that they have supported for years. They just hide behind procedure. They hide in their cloakroom. They hide from the voters. They hide in the back corridors and hallways of this building. They hide to save their own skin. They hide because they are ashamed, and they sure as hell should be ashamed. Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, as chairman of the Senate Armed Serv-ices Subcommittee on Readiness, I would like to make a statement for the record regarding an item of special in-terest inserted into the committee re-port on the National Defense Author-ization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 related to the Department of Defense’s use of its intellectual property rights of cer-tain medical products. The committee report includes lan-guage that purports to direct the De-partment of Defense to exercise its rights under the Bayh-Dole Act ‘‘to au-thorize third parties to use inventions that benefited from DOD funding when-ever the price of a drug, vaccine, or other medical technology is higher in the United States’’ as compared to prices in foreign countries. I am con-cerned that the report language is in-consistent with the original intent of Bayh-Dole and could hinder critical medical developments. Americans, including our men and women in uniform, must have access to affordable healthcare, including pre-scription drugs and medical tech-nologies. However, I fear the com-mittee report directive in question will slow future innovation, lead to a more complex and burdensome regulatory scheme, and make it less likely that our military personnel will be able to access cutting-edge medicines in the future, while doing nothing meaningful to address healthcare costs. The DOD relies on its partnerships with industry to develop vaccines, drugs, and diagnostics that target unique threats faced by our warfighters during oper-ations in theater. As such, the bio-pharmaceutical industry plays a crit-ical role in enhancing our military and civilian defenses against biological, chemical, radiological, and nuclear threats. Federal agencies, such as the DOD, already face significant challenges in attracting top drug and vaccine devel-opers as partners to develop lifesaving medical countermeasures necessary to protect the warfighter. These chal-lenges include low procurement quan-tities, high regulatory risk, complex Federal contracting regulations, and inconsistency in funding, among oth-ers. The added risk of diluting or com-promising intellectual property protec-tions as a means of price control will not only fail to meet its objective, but will serve as an additional deterrent to private sector development of critical medical capabilities offered by DOD. Furthermore, companies who partner with the Federal Government rely heavily on the strength and scope of their intellectual property to generate investment to take their technologies to commercialization. The report lan-guage invokes the Bayh-Dole Act, the purpose of which is to encourage the prompt commercialization of federally funded patents. Prior to Bayh-Dole, collaborations between private indus-try and public entities were rare. The act has fostered a delicate balance of collaborations between Federal agen-cies, public research institutions, and private industry that have resulted in the commercialization of inventions for use by all Americans, especially in the area of medical countermeasures for our servicemen and women. In the drug development context, Federal funding under the Bayh-Dole Act has facilitated the discovery of 153 marketed drugs and vaccines over the last 30 years. The act included the cre-ation of so-called march-in rights to allow agencies to compel additional li-censing if good-faith efforts toward de-velopment are not being made. Agen-cies can also march-in if a licensee can-not produce enough products to meet a national emergency. It is these provi-sions to which the report language re-fers and I believe inappropriately ex-pands the statute’s reach to include Federal price controls and increases the scope of the government’s author-ity. Nothing in the Bayh-Dole Act, whether in march-in rights or other-wise, provides a Federal agency the au-thority to influence the price of a com-mercialized invention. Regulating the price of commercialized intellectual property was never intended by Con-gress when passing the Bayh-Dole Act,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES5784 September 18, 2017 
as evident by the Senate and House re-ports. Congress contemplated the use of march-in rights only ‘‘when the in-vention is not being used.’’ Further, Senators Bayh and Dole have subse-quently explained that the absence of any reference to reasonable pricing in the statute was intentional. As Sen-ator Bayh—the author of and driving force behind the Bayh-Dole Act—has said: Any attempt to use the Bayh- Dole Act to support price controls is a ‘‘flagrant misrepresent[ation]’’ of Congress’s purpose in enacting the statute. Consistent with this position, a Federal agency has never invoked the Bayh-Dole Act to interfere with the price of a commercialized invention. I am aware of petitions to both the NIH and the DOD requesting march-in rights be exercised on the basis of pric-ing, and in all of those cases, the peti-tions were rejected in accordance with the law. The committee report language seeks to authorize something that the stat-ute itself does not. I believe the item of special interest does not accurately re-flect the current intent of Congress with respect to the Bayh-Dole Act, and I encourage the DOD to continue to rely on the existing interpretation of Bayh-Dole law when addressing these matters. Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I want to thank Senator M
CCAINand Senator R
EED for their leadership in producing the National Defense Au-thorization Act for fiscal year 2018. Both veterans, they have a particular understanding of the sacrifices that members of our Armed Services make every day. Every year, this authorization bill is drafted to reflect our commitment to the men and women serving in uni-form, to authorize resources needed to maintain our national security, and to demonstrate the values and principles on which our country was founded. While I believe this bill reflects many sound defense policies, I regrettably cannot support its passage. Yet again, this Defense authorization bill continues to include the shameful and counterproductive measures that block us from ending the terrorist re-cruitment tool that is the Guantanamo Bay detention mission, but the core reason for my opposition to this bill is the reckless price tag its implementa-tion carries. This bill authorizes $700 billion in Defense spending, far above the caps currently established by the Budget Control Act and far more than the increase requested by the President in his budget proposal. If we met this authorization with real dollars, seques-tration would take effect for Defense spending. Secretary Mattis has testi-fied about the perils of sequestration. His message was clear: We must raise the budget caps. What is more, this authorization re-lies on the same tired gimmick we have seen for years and includes $60 bil-lion in overseas contingency operations funding. For fiscal hawks who call for us to reign in Federal spending to re-duce the deficit, we cannot continue to treat OCO funds as privileged dollars— outside the scope of our budget caps— as a means to pay for what should be base spending. Further, we cannot unilaterally boost Defense spending without simi-larly addressing other budgets that contribute to our national security. Earlier this year, in a hearing before the Senate Appropriations Defense Subcommittee, Secretary Mattis clear-ly asserted that ‘‘history is pretty clear, nations that did not keep their fiscal house in order and their econo-mies strong lost their military power.’’ We cannot simply raise spending for the Department of Defense without in-vesting in programs that advance our diplomatic missions overseas and strengthen our domestic security through economic development, infra-structure improvements, environ-mental protections, and that meet the core needs of all Americans. Inflating our Defense spending at the cost of all other programs makes us neither stronger nor more secure. I do want to thank Senator MCCAIN and Senator R
EED for including, through managers’ packages, more than 100 amendments from both Repub-licans and Democrats, including some that I filed. This kind of collaborative process is what has, in the past, yielded results in the Senate. I regret that the amendment process was not more ex-tensive, but hyperpartisan amend-ments that seek to upset the discus-sions of how to responsibly fund our government are not the way to reach consensus for further votes. Make no mistake: This authorization bill invests in our men and women in uniform and their families, and it sup-ports competition to keep our Defense industry healthy, as it should. I hope the reasons for my objection to its pas-sage at this point in the process will be resolved as we move to conference this bill with the House. I believe that, through an agreement to address the current budget caps, those objections can be resolved. Mr. COTTON. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Ms. HIRONO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. 
HEALTHCARE  
Ms. HIRONO. Madam President, 2 months ago, millions of Americans rose up and defeated TrumpCare. In doing so, we reaffirmed that, in the wealthi-est nation on Earth, healthcare is a right and not a privilege that is re-served only for those who can afford it. The President and the Republican Party believe the opposite. To them, healthcare is just another commodity to be bought and sold, but we all know that this is not like buying a new car or a big screen TV. The Republican po-sition shows no heart, no care, and no compassion. It is the exact opposite of what so many of you showed me when I was diagnosed with kidney cancer. Although we successfully defeated TrumpCare in July, we face fresh as-saults to deny every American’s right to healthcare, but it does not have to be this way. In July, so many of us were moved by Senator JOHNMCCAIN’s impassioned plea for the Senate to re-turn to regular order in order to debate how to strengthen our healthcare sys-tem on a bipartisan basis. Since then, Senators L
AMAR ALEXANDER and P ATTY  M
URRAY have worked to build con-sensus for a bill that would strengthen insurance markets and reduce out-of- pocket costs for consumers. They have done this the right way—through com-mittee hearings, bipartisan meetings, and careful deliberation. Instead of embracing and endorsing this effort, the President and the ma-jority leader have now chosen to dou-ble down on their obsession with de-priving healthcare to millions of people across the country through the Gra-ham-Cassidy bill. Let me be clear. This bill is not a compromise. It is not a new and better idea for delivering healthcare in this country. It is just a new version of TrumpCare and, I might say, an even worse proposal than the one we defeated in July. The details matter. This version of TrumpCare eliminates the Affordable Care Act’s Medicaid expansion, and that threatens the coverage for more than 110,000 Hawaii residents who are now receiving such coverage. There are millions all across the country who now get healthcare coverage thanks to Medicaid expansion in their States. This bill establishes a healthcare block grant, including a per capita cap on Medicaid spending that would se-verely limit Federal funding for healthcare—funds that States rely upon. Republicans, including the co-sponsors of this bill, argue that this ap-proach would provide more local con-trol over healthcare. This, however, is what we in Hawaii call ‘‘shibai’’—or BS. Local control through a block grant is just an excuse that Conserv-atives and Republicans use as a pretext to make deep cuts to programs that Americans depend upon. You see them resorting to block-granting every-where—from education to healthcare. A new study from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities reveals the cost of this latest version of TrumpCare firsthand. Under the pro-posal, Hawaii would lose $659 million in Federal funding for Medicaid over 10 years—part of some $80 billion in cuts across the country. This is a lot of money for Hawaii to lose—money that is being put to great use across our State. Last month, I visited the Bay Clinic in Hilo, on the Big Island, where the Medicaid expansion under the ACA has improved health outcomes in poor

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5785 September 18, 2017 
rural communities across that island. Bay Clinic is the primary healthcare provider to 6 of the 10 poorest ZIP Codes in the entire State of Hawaii, where many residents went years with-out having health coverage. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, the Bay Clinic has successfully enrolled thousands more people in Medicaid and decreased the number of uninsured patients who have gone through their doors. It is as-tounding what the numbers show. The number of patients who have gone through their doors has been cut from 29 percent in 2010 to only 10 per-cent in 2015. That is how many more people on the island of Hawaii are able to get healthcare coverage. Over that same time period, the Bay Clinic has seen an almost 20-percent increase in the number of patients it has served every year. In the years following the passage of the ACA, the Bay Clinic and commu-nity health centers all across Hawaii have hired more doctors and nurses, and they have expanded the types of services that they provide. The Bay Clinic, for example, has expanded its Mobile Health Unit, by which doctors go to rural communities, such as in Keaau, where residents would other-wise not have access to primary care providers. This program and others like it in Hawaii and across the country face an imminent threat from this newest version of TrumpCare. Unfortunately, this bill’s devastating cuts to Medicaid are only part of what makes it so mean and so dangerous. It eliminates all premium subsidies that allow lower income Americans to afford coverage, and it eliminates cost- sharing subsidies that reduce out-of- pocket expenses for consumers. These are the very issues relating to the Af-fordable Care Act that Chairman L
AMAR ALEXANDER and Ranking Mem-ber P
ATTY MURRAY are addressing through regular order—how to provide healthcare for more people in our coun-try. The Graham-Cassidy bill creates a process by which States can receive waivers to roll back essential health benefits and eliminate important con-sumer protections, like guaranteed coverage for millions of Americans who are living with preexisting conditions— people like me. I have said many times on the floor of the Senate that we are all only one diagnosis away from a major illness. Every day, 6,540 people are diagnosed with cancer in our country. There are 4,109 who are diagnosed with diabetes. There are 1,309 who are diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease every day in this country. We are all one diagnosis away from a major illness. These are people like me—many of them—going about their business when, wham, suddenly, you get a devastating diagnosis. Not all of these people will have health in-surance, and under this version of TrumpCare, even more of them will not have access to it. When I was diagnosed with kidney cancer, I had insurance. Instead of wor-rying about how to pay for my treat-ment, I could focus on fighting my ill-ness. No one facing cancer, heart dis-ease, diabetes, or any other chronic or life-threatening medical condition—or, I should say, any kind of circumstance in which one needs to have access to a healthcare provider—should have to worry about whether one can afford the care that might, one day, save one’s life—not in the richest country in the world, not where healthcare should be a right and not a privilege.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES5786 September 18, 2017 
the fiscal year 2018 national defense au-thorization bill, I would like to make a few closing comments. When we began considering this bill last week, Senator M
CCAINand I were interested in returning to regular order and having debate and votes on any amendment that needed a vote. We ac-tually started off very well. While I disagreed with Senator P
AUL’s amendment to sunset the cur-rent authorization for the use of mili-tary force, I am pleased we were able to follow regular order on his amendment and have a debate. It is my hope that we can use this as a step to restore reg-ular order going forward and work to-gether, along with Senator P
AUL, in drafting a new AUMF that more pre-cisely addresses the threats we face and resolves the issue, which is very critical, that Senator P
AULhas raised; that is, updating the AUMF. After the Paul amendment, however, we were unable to come to an agree-ment on further votes. As a result, sev-eral issues that are important to both sides were not fully considered. On the Democratic side, Senators B
ALDWIN , S
TABENOW , and D ONNELLY had very im-portant amendments that would have ensured important protection for American workers and that our serv-icemembers receive high-quality, do-mestically produced equipment. In addition, Senator D
URBIN had an important amendment that supports the world-class medical research DOD conducts and has a profound impact on the health of our servicemembers and citizens alike. Senator W
ARREN would have liked a discussion on the INF Treaty, and Senator G
ILLIBRAND was interested in a full debate on protec-tions for military personnel who are transgender. As I indicated, I also know there are Members on the other side of the aisle who also had important issues they wanted to debate. I regret we were not able to have those debates and votes. I am pleased, however, that we are able to include several dozen agreed- upon amendments in this bill from both Democrats and Republicans which will strengthen the legislation. In the end, this bill represents a strong bipar-tisan effort to provide the military with the resources they need and the support they deserve. Moving forward, more work needs to be done. It is clear we need to find a sustainable, equitable path forward that will end sequestration and provide the additional resources needed for our current readiness shortfalls. I look for-ward to working together to continue to address the needs of the Department and our servicemembers. I would like to close by thanking Senator M
CCAINin my remarks about the NDAA for his leadership in guiding this bill through our committee mark-up process and the floor. I believe this bill truly exemplifies Senator M
CCAIN’s unrivaled dedication to the men and women of our Armed Forces. His firm hand and unwavering resolve for a bi-partisan approach were invaluable in achieving a bill that reflects the prior-ities of many Members on both sides of the aisle. Additionally, I would like to thank the committee staff who worked tire-lessly over many weeks to make this bill a reality. I thank the majority staff director, Chris Brose, and his staff for their hard work and commitment to a bipartisan process. I would also like to thank my staff for their exper-tise and dedication to creating the best bill possible—Jody Bennett, Carolyn Chuhta, Jon Clark, Jonathan Epstein, Jorie Feldman, Jon Green, Creighton Greene, Ozge Guzelsu, Gary Leeling, Kirk McConnell, Maggie McNamara, Bill Monahan, Mike Noblet, John Quirk, Arun Seraphin, and Elizabeth King. Finally, I would like to thank the floor staff, without whom none of this could be accomplished. I must say, having completed a truly bipartisan process using regular order, I am disappointed to hear that my col-leagues on the other side of the aisle would like to bring back the partisan efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and its protections for people with preexisting conditions and decimate Medicare as we know it. We have already spent so much time this year having this fight—time we could have spent working on a bipar-tisan basis to improve our health care system and lower costs. We voted deci-sively in July to reject the partisan bill. With these votes, Senators on both sides of the aisle decided we would re-turn to regular order and work toward bipartisan health care solutions that could get at least 60 votes in this body. As I have highlighted, this kind of bi-partisan approach is why we have been successful in bringing the NDAA to the floor each year, and Senators ALEX-
ANDER and M URRAY have been doing just that with respect to the HELP Committee. They have had four hear-ings over the last two weeks, with wit-nesses from both parties, from Gov-ernors to health insurance commis-sioners, to leaders in the industry. I have great confidence in my colleagues and their ability to craft a bipartisan bill to improve the ACA that a major-ity of Senators could support. This is a bipartisan, inclusive process, and I should note, it is undertaken by one of the two committees that have jurisdic-tion for health care. So for my Republican colleagues to now decide, after this critical work is already underway, that we are going to scratch those efforts and return in-stead to a partisan process, in which not even Republican Senators have had the opportunity to fully review the bill, make changes or even get analysis of the bill, I think that process is wrong. Let’s not be fooled by the new effort. The legislation would have the same effects as the other versions of TrumpCare we saw rejected. We have heard the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee will hold a hearing on the latest version of TrumpCare. This is not the right process. It is not rep-resentative of the legislative process. I would urge my colleagues to reject this approach and, rather, follow the example I think we have tried to set in NDAA—a bipartisan, regular process, in which amendments are offered by both sides, in which debate is under-taken, in which we come to a conclu-sion based on 60 votes and move for-ward to improve the country, particu-larly to protect the men and women in the armed services. With that, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. LANKFORD ). The Senator from Arizona. Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, today the Senate will vote on final pas-sage of the National Defense Author-ization Act for Fiscal Year 2018. This is the culmination of months of bipar-tisan work, and it is a product in which all Senators and all Americans can take great pride. I want to thank, once again, my friend and colleague the Sen-ator from Rhode Island. His partner-ship on this legislation has been in-valuable. The fundamental purpose of this leg-islation, which has united Senators from both sides of the aisle, is to pro-vide our Armed Forces what they need to do the jobs we ask of them. We, in this body, have no higher duty than to do everything we can to support our fellow Americans who serve and sac-rifice every day to keep us safe. This legislation does that. It keeps faith with our men and women in uni-form. It supports a national defense budget of $700 billion for fiscal year 2018, which exceeds the administra-tion’s request by $37 billion and the de-fense spending caps in the Budget Con-trol Act by $91 billion. The decision of the Committee on Armed Services to authorize these additional resources was unanimous and bipartisan, and it is a significant statement on the trou-bling state of our military today. My friends, for too long, our Nation has asked our men and women in uni-form to do too much with far too little. Much of the blame lies with the last administration, but we in Congress cannot escape responsibility. Our mili-tary’s job is hard enough, but we are making it harder through continuing resolutions, unpredictable funding, and arbitrary spending caps that we put into law 6 years ago before the rise of ISIS, before the current crisis with North Korea, before Russia’s return to aggression on the world stage, and be-fore so many other dangerous develop-ments. We have been warned—we have been warned, my friends—that we can’t go on like this. We have been warned. Ear-lier this year, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Joseph Dunford, warned us: ‘‘In just a few years if we don’t change the trajectory, we will lose our qualitative and our quantitative competitive edge, [and] the consequences will be profound.’’ The Secretary of Defense, Jim Mattis,

also warned us, saying: ‘‘We are no longer managing risk; we are now gam-bling.’’ We are gambling, my friends. We are gambling with the lives of the best among us, and we are now seeing the cost—the tragic but foreseeable cost— of an overworked, strained force, with aging equipment and not enough of it. On June 17, seven sailors were killed when the USS Fitzgerald collided with a container ship off the coast of Japan. On July 10, a Marine KC–130 crash in Mississippi killed all 16 troops on board. On August 5, an Osprey heli-copter crash off the coast of Australia resulted in the deaths of three Marines. On August 15, an Army helicopter crashed off the coast of Hawaii, with five soldiers presumed dead. On August 21, 10 sailors perished when the USS McCain collided with a tanker near Singapore. On August 25, an Army Black Hawk helicopter went down dur-ing a training mission off the coast of Yemen, and one soldier died. Earlier this month in Nevada, two Air Force A–10 aircraft crashed into each other. Thank God the pilots safely ejected, but the planes were lost, at a cost of over $100 million. Just last week—just last week, as we debated this legislation—there were ad-ditional accidents. Last Tuesday, one soldier died during helicopter training at Fort Hood. Last Wednesday, an am-phibious vehicle explosion at Camp Pendleton injured 15 marines. Last Thursday, a demolition accident at Fort Bragg killed another soldier and injured seven others. My friends, more of our men and women in uniform are now being killed in totally avoidable training accidents and routine operations than by our en-emies in combat. Let me repeat that. More of our men and women in uniform are now being killed in totally avoid-able training accidents and routine op-erations than by our enemies in com-bat. Where is the outrage? Where is our sense of urgency to deal with this prob-lem? Congress can criticize this admin-istration or the last administration all we want, and there is plenty of blame to go around, but the constitutional re-sponsibility is to ‘‘raise and support Armies’’ and ‘‘provide and maintain a Navy.’’ That responsibility is ours. How can we believe that we are meet-ing our responsibilities when young Americans in uniform are not receiving the necessary resources and capabili-ties to perform their missions? My friends, that blame rests with us, the Congress. I know many of my colleagues agree. I have heard them—both Republicans and Democrats—speak for years about the harmful effects sequestration is having on our military and many other Federal agencies with a national secu-rity mission. How do we explain our failure to deal with this problem last week? We had an opportunity. This leg-islation was open for amendments under regular order for an entire week. There was an amendment offered by the Senator from Arkansas to repeal sequestration. The amendment was written in a bipartisan way and would have ended sequestration, not only for defense but nondefense spending as well. We had an opportunity to tell all of our men and women in uniform that the Senate finally was doing every-thing it could to support them. We had an opportunity, and we failed. Worse than that, we didn’t even try. We couldn’t even agree to vote. It makes me so angry, but more than that it makes me sad. It breaks my heart. How do we explain our failure to our men and women who are serving? How do we explain to Americans who are risking their lives for us that we could not summon the courage to take some hard votes? How can we explain we couldn’t come together and vote to-gether when it mattered most? How do we explain the signal our inaction sends to all who are serving that Con-gress has higher priorities than re-building our military? We should be ashamed of ourselves. For those of you who will soon vote for this National Defense Authoriza-tion Act, which will authorize the nec-essary resources to begin rebuilding our military, let me thank you; let me thank you; let me thank you. You can be proud that you are voting for a good piece of legislation, but this legislation is only part of the solution. We still have no path to actually appropriate the money that we are about to author-ize. That requires a bipartisan agree-ment to adjust the spending caps in the Budget Control Act. For all of you who will join me in voting to authorize these vital addi-tional resources for our military, I would also urge you to join me in de-manding and passing a bipartisan agreement so that we can appropriate those resources. This will require some hard work. It will require some team-work and some trust in each other. It will require having the courage of our convictions. But in the end, it will re-quire much less of us than the service and sacrifice we ask every day from our men and women in uniform, which they so dutifully provide us. I do not want to have to call another grieving mother or father or spouse after their loved one has perished in a mishap that might have been prevented if Congress had done its job. Let’s find a way to appropriate the resources for our military that we will soon author-ize. Our men and women in uniform de-serve no less. Mr. President, I will suggest a short quorum call while we get these final agreed-upon amendments on the bill at this time. It shouldn’t take more than 3 or 4 minutes. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. M CCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

HEALTHCARE  
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the Sen-ate has spent a great deal of time over the last 6 or 7 months on healthcare in America. For years after the passage of the Affordable Care Act, the Repub-lican Party—the House and Senate— has called for repeal of the bill. Yet, when the time came, with the majority of Republicans in the House and the Senate and, of course, a Republican President, and the task was imme-diately before them, they faltered be-cause they didn’t have a replacement. They didn’t have something to propose that was better. As a consequence, their efforts stopped short—one vote short—on the floor of the Senate sev-eral weeks ago. We still face some significant chal-lenges. Some of those are very imme-diate. Before the end of September, we will face the prospect of needing to reau-thorize the Children’s Health Insurance Program, known as CHIP. This pro-gram provides health insurance cov-erage for more than 9 million children and pregnant women across the coun-try—350,000 in my State. This vital pro-gram, the CHIP program, has had two decades of broad bipartisan support, and it is going to expire in 12 days. The good news is that the Finance Committee chairman, O
RRIN HATCH of Utah, and his ranking member, R
ON W
YDEN of Oregon, have reached a bipar-tisan agreement on a 5-year reauthor-ization of the CHIP program.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5797 September 18, 2017 
The bad news is that instead of pre-serving healthcare for low-income chil-dren and pregnant women, the Senate Republican leadership seems more in-terested in the next 12 days in calling a different issue—a different bill—alto-gether, the Graham-Cassidy bill, relat-ing to health insurance across Amer-ica. That bill would take health insur-ance coverage away from millions of Americans, including 1 million in the State of Illinois. From where I am sitting, reauthor-izing the CHIP program is a priority to not only serve the 9 million children and pregnant women across our coun-try but 350,000 in my State. There is another bill we need to reau-thorize before the end of September: the funding of our Nation’s community health centers. Like CHIP, funding for community health centers expires at the end of this month—in just a few days. Also like CHIP, community health centers have enjoyed decades of broad bipartisan support. We have 10,000 community health centers across our country. They serve 26 million Americans. Community health centers serve 1 out of every 10 children, 1 in 6 Americans living in rural areas, and more than 330,000 of our Nation’s vet-erans. Illinois’ 52 health center organiza-tions receive $150 million in Federal funding in order to provide care to the 1.3 million people in 360 locations in the State of Illinois. I have been to many of these locations, and I have said in real candor and honesty that if I had a medical issue or if there were one in my family, I would enter the community health centers in my State with confidence that I and my family would receive the very best of care. They are outstanding organizations. If Congress doesn’t act within 12 days, community health centers in my State and across the Nation will see their funding cut by 70 percent. That dramatic funding cut would result in 2,800 community health centers closing across America, 50,000 jobs lost, and 9 million people losing access to healthcare. Well, there is good news here as well. Because of Senators B
LUNT and S TABE -
NOW taking the lead, they are pushing for swift reauthorization of community health center funding. But the problem is that there is another bill—the Gra-ham-Cassidy bill—which has captured the attention and apparently the cal-endar time for the Senate—at least that is the possibility we hear. So why shouldn’t Congress be spending the next 12 crucial days reauthorizing the Children’s Health Insurance Program across America and making certain our community health centers don’t lose the critical Federal funding they need to serve so many people? Right now, we know we face some challenges when it comes to the health insurance market in America. Approxi-mately 6 percent of Americans—3 per-cent of people in my State—purchase their health insurance in the individual marketplace, with more than 50 per-cent of these people receiving some subsidies to help pay for costs. How-ever, many of these people are seeing dramatic increases in premiums. We know that, and we know it is a chal-lenge and one we need to address. Here is the good news—and it is time for some good news when it comes to healthcare. Almost from the minute that the critical vote was cast ending the repeal of ObamaCare, meetings started taking place. I can recall, as the Senate was adjourning, I looked back by the cloakroom, and there was Senator LAMAR ALEXANDER and Sen-ator P
ATTY MURRAY talking in the middle of the night—about 3 o’clock in the morning. I later learned that they had reached an agreement between them—a Republican, a Democrat—on the HELP Committee to start a series of hearings about what we could do as a Senate to actually strengthen the healthcare system in America. That was before our August recess. When we got back from recess, they had kept their word. I attended three or four of the Member hearings, which they held before the official public hearings a little later in the morning. These were good meetings. At the first one, I recall Senator A
LEXANDER saying 53 Senators—Democrats and Repub-licans—showed up for coffee and dough-nuts to meet with insurance commis-sioners from five different States. Just a few days after that, there was an-other coffee-and-doughnut session, an-other good bipartisan turnout of Sen-ators as we sat down with five Gov-ernors, Democrats and Republicans, who talked about health insurance. A few days later, another meeting took place where experts came in and talked about the subject. I felt there was more accomplished in those 3 hours with those outstanding witnesses from across the country than all of the time we had spent giving speeches to one another on the floor of the Senate in the previous 7 months. It was interesting. We brought in these people from different States, different political parties, and they virtually had the same thing to tell us. There were a handful of things which we could do that could make an imme-diate, positive impact to make the cost of health insurance a lot more predict-able—not to say we are going to bring it down—I don’t want to be overprom-ising—but to slow the rate of growth in health insurance costs as well as pro-vide stability in the insurance market. Here are the things that came out loud and clear from these bipartisan Senate meetings. First, they told us to stop playing games with cost-sharing reduction sub-sidies. These are subsidies to insurance companies that take on individuals with expensive health histories. These insurance companies are given support by subsidies so that they can keep the premium costs for these individuals under control. These cost-sharing reduction sub-sidies help 7 million Americans afford their copayments and deductibles on their health insurance policies. The current Trump administration has re-peatedly threatened to stop the pay-ments. As a result, individual market premiums keep going up because of the uncertainty of whether the government is going to keep its promise to make these cost-reduction subsidies. I remember the commissioner from the State of South Carolina told us, I say to the Senator from Oregon, who is our ranking Democrat on the Finance Committee—he said: I am going to an-nounce a 30-percent increase in health insurance premiums. If I knew that these cost-sharing reduction subsidies were coming, it would be 10 percent. I can eliminate 20 percent of the antici-pated increase in premium costs if these subsidies come through. It is pretty clear to me, this is sound policy, on a bipartisan basis, which would have a dramatic impact in re-ducing the cost of premiums to many individuals. That came through loud and clear in every meeting we had with Senators MURRAY and A LEXANDER . The second thing they talked about was State reinsurance. I don’t under-stand that as well as some, but it has worked in States where the State picks up a share of the liability for health in-surance between certain dollar amounts so the private insurance com-panies don’t end up with that burden. Because of this reinsurance, they are able to keep premium costs down. The third thing is to provide States with more flexibility without under-mining some really fundamental issues—without undermining, for ex-ample, the preexisting condition pro-tection we currently have. I left those meetings feeling encour-aged. After 7 months of bitter political rhetoric, which led to nothing on the floor of the Senate, we were finally sit-ting down, on a bipartisan basis, with Democrats and Republicans all across our country with specific suggestions which could help our healthcare sys-tem. That, to me, is the way to move forward. That, to me, is the lesson learned from much wasted time so far this year. Unfortunately, this whole ef-fort may be derailed. Senators C
ASSIDY and G RAHAM have come up with a legislative alternative they want to move forward. Unfortu-nately, the measure they have pro-posed has not been scored by the Con-gressional Budget Office nor carefully measured to find out what impact it would have on the American healthcare system, which accounts for one-sixth of the American national economy. Here is what we know about the Cas-sidy and Graham proposal. What they are suggesting is basically eliminating the subsidies which help individuals pay for private health insurance and bringing to a halt the Medicaid expan-sion which has covered millions of Americans and given them health in-surance. What they say instead is something which has been said many times on the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES5798 September 18, 2017 
floor: We will just give all the money to the Governors, and they will figure it out. They will figure out how to save money in their States. It turns out, Governors of both political parties warn us: If you are going to give us a set amount of money as the cost of healthcare continues to go up, don’t expect us to cover as many people or provide as good a coverage if we do it on a State-by-State basis. So who supports this new Cassidy- Graham approach and who opposes it? Every single medical advocacy group— the hospitals, the doctors, the nurses— all across America oppose this Cassidy- Graham approach, as well as the med-ical advocacy groups, because they un-derstand their approach would allow discrimination against individuals in-sured based on a history of preexisting conditions—going back to the bad old days before we passed the Affordable Care Act. The Cassidy-Graham approach, which they brought to us, doesn’t add up. If you take $300 billion or $400 billion out of this healthcare system, dump it into the laps of Governors across this coun-try and say, ‘‘Good luck. Do it on a local basis. I am sure it will all work out,’’ they will quickly tell you, as they have had in the bipartisan meet-ings we have had, it will not work. It does not compute. It may be able to check the box from some things to re-peal the Affordable Care Act, but they certainly didn’t replace it with any-thing of equal or better value. The op-posite is true. That is why I think we ought to think twice. There is a mad dash now in the last 12 days to do many things. From a po-litical viewpoint, there is a limited op-portunity for this repeal effort. That 12-day period is a limited window under the Senate rules of reconciliation. It is a mistake, as far as I am concerned, for us to move toward Cassidy-Graham— concepts which have been roundly op-posed in my State and across the Na-tion, concepts which have failed on the floor of the Senate. Let us roll up our sleeves and do three things that do make sense: Let’s reauthorize the Children’s Health In-surance Program. Let’s make sure those kids and their pregnant moms are going to have the basic coverage they have enjoyed for almost 20 years. Let’s also reauthorize the commu-nity health centers. We know they work. We know when people have a medical home, they are less likely to let medical conditions get worse and more expensive. That, to me, is a good investment to make sure they con-tinue. Finally, let’s turn toward a real bi-partisan effort, a measure which can emerge soon—I hope within days—from Senators M
URRAY and A LEXANDER on a bipartisan basis. I know they are still working on it. They haven’t reached a final agreement on what they are doing, but I hope all of us, in both po-litical parties, will encourage them to do the right thing. Remember when JOHN MCCAINcame to the floor after he had been diagnosed with the cancer he is battling now. He came here and cast a crucial vote to proceed to debate this whole issue of healthcare. Then he asked to speak for 15 minutes, and I stayed in my chair. I wanted to hear it. He reminded us of the importance of doing things on a bi-partisan basis and doing them thought-fully when it comes to something as important as healthcare. Let us keep that speech by J
OHNMCCAINand that lesson in mind. Let us resist this Cas-sidy-Graham approach, which has no support when it comes to the medical community, and instead work on the bipartisan approach from A
LEXANDER  and M
URRAY , together with the Fi-nance Committee—which I know Sen-ator W
YDEN is going to address next— so we can have a bipartisan solution. The American people sent us here to solve problems, not to create them. Cassidy-Graham creates problems. Let’s find solutions which solve prob-lems. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Oregon. Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, before the Senator leaves the floor, I just want to draw attention to the central point the Senator from Illinois has been making tonight. He has been fo-cused on what our duties to the Amer-ican people are all about, which is to make their lives better and particu-larly to improve the quality of their healthcare, which is a lifeline for mil-lions of families. Now, instead of looking at bipartisan approaches to make the lives of our people better—Chairman H
ATCH and I introduced the children’s health bill today. Nine million youngsters with that program get better health. Instead of focusing on that, as my colleague from Illinois has said, we are going to be looking at a bill that will hurt our people, will give them worse healthcare, will go backward with re-spect to the march in our country to make sure we recognize that all our people—all our people—deserve quality and affordable healthcare. I particularly appreciate my col-league pointing out the contrast be-tween where we ought to go with a bi-partisan proposal like the children’s health plan and where we shouldn’t go—which is the Graham-Cassidy-Hell-er proposal which is going to go back-ward with respect to the healthcare needs of our people. The fact is, Graham-Cassidy-Heller has been exposed to sunlight for just a few days, but it is already clear this legislation is a bad deal for the Amer-ican people. Now, Senator C
ASSIDY has introduced healthcare bills before. Earlier this year, he introduced a bill with our col-league from Maine, Senator C
OLLINS , as an alternative to what the Senate Republican leadership put on offer. Now, I had my concerns with that pro-posal, but the first thing I want the Senate to understand is this Cassidy bill, which we will soon be considering, is much worse. The reason I say that is, this bill lowers the bar for legislation which has been hastily written and ill- considered. I want to be clear. This Cassidy bill will flunk the Jimmy Kim-mel test of not hurting kids in America with preexisting conditions. To make matters worse, just this evening, I have been informed that the Senate Finance Committee will shortly announce a hearing for next Monday on the Graham-Cassidy-Heller proposal. Contrary to the norms of the Senate Finance Committee, I was not con-sulted in this matter as the ranking Democrat. I am all for debating major legislation, but talking about a piece of legislation which will not have the Congressional Budget Office—our inde-pendent arbiter of these matters—give us their thoughts on coverage or pre-mium matters less than 48 hours before a vote is scheduled to happen is a sham process, which makes a mockery of the very eloquent words of our colleague from Arizona Senator MCCAIN, who ap-pealed for the regular way in which the Senate handles legislation. This means Senators will not know how many millions of Americans are going to wake up not knowing if they have healthcare, how many seniors would get kicked out of a nursing home or see their core healthcare needs not met. How much will Americans’ pre-miums go up? Senate Republicans have no answers on any of these matters. What Graham-Cassidy-Heller does do is give a super block grant blank check to the States. They can do whatever they want—whatever they want—in terms of Americans’ healthcare, and it guts the funding for those block grants over a very short period of time. This will mean a whale of a lot of pain for vulnerable people and an open door to some of the worst abuses of insurance companies, the abuses we thought we had gotten rid of. Democrats and Re-publicans thought we had gotten rid of them back when I introduced a bill with seven Democrats and seven Re-publicans. Now we are talking about bringing them back. This bill amounts to the largest healthcare devolution, moving power without any account-ability at all to the States. Now, if I might get into some of the specifics. This bill does especially seri-ous damage to Medicaid. In fact, it really hollows out the Medicaid Pro-gram. This year’s debate over healthcare made one thing quite clear: Medicaid matters. It pays for the healthcare of our most vulnerable. It serves as a safety net for those who might not think they are ever going to need it. It covers nursing home care for older peo-ple who spend down hard-earned sav-ings. It pays for critically needed ad-diction treatment services for those who struggle with opioids. We know that is what millions of Americans are facing now. It helps Americans with disabilities and kids with special needs

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5799 September 18, 2017 
live a healthier, more productive life in their communities rather than in insti-tutions. That is just a little bit of the good Medicaid does for folks from Portland, OR, to Portland, ME. Under the Gra-ham-Cassidy-Heller proposal, that is gone—simply gone. The plan ends ex-panded Medicaid coverage which 11 million Americans count on right now. It caps Medicaid and guts hundreds of billions of dollars in support from the Federal Government. In effect, it is like telling States, good luck, and tell-ing them you can make the hard deci-sions about which Americans are going to get adequate healthcare and who are going to be those unfortunate souls who go without. My view is, this is going to lead to destitution for older Americans who count on Medicaid for nursing home care. It also represents a massive transfer of dollars from States which expanded Medicaid to States which chose not to. History tells us that the most vulner-able Americans without a voice or a powerful lobby are the ones who are going to be the worst off. Now, I have heard my colleagues—Senator C
ASSIDY , in particular—claim that this bill is modeled on the Children’s Health In-surance Program—which is a block- granted program—and that means all supporters of CHIP should support Gra-ham-Cassidy-Heller. Nothing could be further from the truth. The Children’s Health Insurance Program has been an extraordinarily successful program for more than 20 years, now covering 9 million young-sters. Part of that success is due to its reliance on a strong Medicaid Program. If Medicaid and the rest of the healthcare system is block-granted and slashed by hundreds of billions of dol-lars, the pillars that support a success-ful Children’s Health Insurance Pro-gram will crumble. They will lose their structural support. A vote in favor of Graham-Cassidy is a vote to demolish successful healthcare programs like the Children’s Health Insurance Pro-gram and its promise of affordable healthcare for millions of kids and their families. There is one more step that the Gra-ham-Cassidy-Heller bill takes that is different from previous versions. Rath-er than reducing the tax credits that help Americans get help—similar to earlier Republican approaches—again, this bill just chucks them out, gets rid of them, gone. That means asking States to use their Federal health block grant for a whole host of com-peting healthcare priorities, in effect, pitting vulnerable Americans against each other and not having enough at the table to meet the critical needs of some of our most vulnerable people— people who, day in and day out, are walking on an economic tightrope, try-ing to balance their food costs against their medical costs and their medical costs against housing. Graham-Cassidy-Heller is a recipe for disaster. This proposal, again, opens loopholes for insurance companies that, as I described, we thought we had closed, thought we had finally closed the book on the days when healthcare wasn’t just for the healthy and wealthy. That is what happened when we had discrimination against those with preexisting conditions. If you had a preexisting condition and you were wealthy—just pay the bill. If you didn’t have any preexisting conditions, there was nothing to worry about. For the millions of people who fi-nally got some peace of mind at night when we eliminated discrimination against those with preexisting condi-tions, this brings back that ugly pros-pect that a key consumer protection, the protection that bars discrimination against those who have preexisting conditions, is just tossed aside—just as what looks to be the setting aside of essential health benefits that all Amer-icans are entitled to receive. It was pretty obvious during the TrumpCare debate that unraveling the consumer protections that our people count on today leads to the entire sys-tem falling apart, and the vulnerable bear the brunt of the pain. Many of our friends and neighbors have spent the year raising their voices and showing up to stop bad healthcare legislation. Thanks to their grassroots efforts, the partisan approach that I have described as being used here again has been stopped multiple times. I wanted to come on the floor tonight to say to people in every community across our great country that, once again, we need people power. Once again, we need them to stand up and say that we don’t want to turn back the clock on the healthcare needs of the most vulnerable, like seniors and the disabled and our kids. Once again, we hope they will speak out all across the country. I am going to be having townhall meetings this upcoming weekend after the Jewish holiday. You can be sure that I am going to hear a lot from the people of Oregon about this. I am very hopeful that, once again, people power around America is going to come for-ward and say to those who are talking about supporting Graham-Cassidy-Hell-er that this is a mistake, that they don’t want to turn back the clock with respect to healthcare; they want to move forward. Instead of turning back the clock, what they are looking for is leadership, for example, that will hold down their prescription drug costs. I have introduced legislation to re-quire these companies to publicly jus-tify raising their prices. We have had Senators introduce a host of bills. That is what we ought to be doing—talking about how we are going to improve American healthcare. My colleague from Illinois mentioned the Children’s Health Insurance Pro-gram, which Chairman H
ATCH and I worked with our Finance colleagues to get introduced, and there is the Com-munity Health Center Program. I could go on and on about opportunities for bipartisanship to take the country in the right direction rather than in the wrong direction. Instead, it doesn’t look as though that is going to be on offer any time soon. What is going to be on offer is a proposal that turns back the clock, guts Medicaid, harms seniors, harms the vulnerable, and I think would be a major mistake. My bottom line has long been that for changes to the healthcare system to be sustainable and lasting, they have to be bipartisan. That is why I mentioned an effort that I was involved in. Several of my colleagues who co-sponsored the bill I am talking about have been supportive of that for quite some time. We know Republicans and Democrats know how to write bipartisan legisla-tion. But what the Graham-Cassidy- Heller bill seeks to do is just the oppo-site—to use the most deeply partisan process the Senate knows, called rec-onciliation. It basically says: Our way or the highway—not interested in try-ing to find common ground. I will point out that didn’t end too well earlier when we talked about healthcare. I came to the floor tonight to make the case that we cannot let partisan reconciliation tactics win on this key issue. We ought to be working together to improve healthcare on a bi-partisan basis, in a way that helps peo-ple all across the country. I have mentioned—this is particu-larly important to me—a number of bills that colleagues on both sides of the aisle have worked on that would help improve the lives of the American people. Graham-Cassidy-Heller does not meet that test. I hope my col-leagues will reject it, and I hope that all across the country, from one corner of America to every other, people will step up and they will say, as I have said on this floor: The political change doesn’t start in Washington, DC, and then trickle down; it is bottom up. It is bottom up, as people come forward and say ‘‘That is not the way to go’’ and say ‘‘Here is the way that really would make sense and make our lives better.’’ I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. LANKFORD.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
100TH ANNIVERSARY OF MOUNT AIRY MISSIONARY BAPTIST CHURCH ∑Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, today I stand to honor the 100th anniversary of the Mount Airy Missionary Baptist Church, located on Maffitt Avenue in St. Louis, MO. This impressive 100th anniversary milestone speaks volumes about the tremendous impact Mount Airy Church has had on its congrega-tion, community, and the broader St. Louis community. First organized as a prayer band on August 8, 1917, Mount Airy has had many homes throughout its 100-year history. Over its history, while its base home address might have changed, the Mount Airy membership and effect of its faith leadership grew. Today Mount Airy is a thriving house of worship led by pastor Reverend Charles J. Brown, Sr. Pastor Brown re-ceived an honorary doctorate degree of divinity from Western Bible College, becoming the first pastor in the his-tory of Mount Airy Missionary Baptist Church to receive an honorary degree. Over the years, the church has ex-panded its ministries to engage more people and positively influence thou-sands of lives. Mount Airy Church has been innovative and compassionate in finding ways to reach their congrega-tion and the community. The commit-ment of Pastor Brown, all of Mount Airy Missionary Baptist Church leader-ship, and its entire congregation to studying the word of God and faithfully living it sets an incredible example for all Missourians. Congratulations again to all con-nected with Mount Airy Missionary Baptist Church on its 100-year anniver-sary.∑ f 
REMEMBERING GRACE SHU TSA0- WU ∑Ms. DUCKWORTH. Mr. President, today I wish to commemorate the life of Grace Shu Tsao-Wu, a dedicated en-trepreneur and activist.

As the founder of a successful com-pany, Ms. Tsao-Wu brought her cre-ative energy to Chicago. She was stead-fast in her community leadership and always challenged others to be their best. Ms. Tsao-Wu leaves behind not only a great legacy, but also a shining light that serves as an inspiration to many. Thank you.∑

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS By Mr. M
CCONNELL: S. 1824. A bill to reform the Appa-lachian Regional Commission, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works. Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr President, for decades, I have supported the Appa-lachian Regional Commission, or ARC, and its mission to invest in commu-nities to strengthen economic growth throughout the Appalachian region. As I have expressed before, however, I have grown frustrated by ARC’s shortcomings. Last year, the Senate considered an amendment to abolish ARC entirely. I voted against that pro-posal because I believe that the Com-mission still serves an important pur-pose, but since that time I’ve been call-ing on ARC to clarify its clouded focus. For instance, because of ARC’s own rules, the most distressed counties in the region can only receive up to 30% of its area development funds. In other words, a substantial portion of the agency’s resources—which should be fo-cused on alleviating poverty—are in-tentionally directed away from the counties most in need of help. This has been a criticism leveled against ARC for years. I believe that, if ARC serves a valid purpose today, then it is to as-sist the most impoverished counties in the region. Moreover, while the other regional commissions are headquartered in the areas for which they’re designed to serve, ARC maintains its primary of-fice right here in Washington, D.C. An expensive office near Dupont Circle, far

away from the people and the commu-nities it serves, is not the right place for ARC. Today, I will introduce legislation along with my friend and longtime ARC champion, Congressman H
ALROG-
ERS, to make desperately needed re-forms at ARC. Our bill is designed to reform the Commission, to focus its mission on investing more in the poor-est Appalachian communities, and to direct ARC’s leadership to relocate the organization to the region it serves. These common-sense reforms will help set ARC on a path toward ful-filling what should be its central mis-sion—poverty alleviation—and deliv-ering vital assistance to those who need it the most. I hope that all of my colleagues will join with me to move this legislation forward and provide necessary relief to communities in Ap-palachia. Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the R
ECORD . There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the R
ECORD , as follows: 
S. 1824 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-resentatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Appalachian Regional Commission Reform Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
(a) H EADQUARTERS .—Congress finds that— (1) regional commissions, such as the Delta Regional Authority, the Denali Commission, and the Northern Border Regional Commis-sion, are each headquartered in their respec-tive region; (2) headquartering regional commissions within the region affected is a sensible ap-proach to ensure that the commissions are housed in more affordable locations than the District of Columbia, thereby reducing ad-ministrative overhead and making the com-missions closer and more accountable to the people the commissions were designed to serve; (3) the Appalachian Regional Commission (referred to in this Act as the ‘‘Commis-sion’’) is not headquartered in Appalachia but in Washington, D.C.; and (4) the headquarters of the Commission should be relocated from the District of Co-lumbia to a more affordable location in the Appalachian region so that it is closer and more accountable to the people the Commis-sion was designed to serve. (b) P
ERFORMANCE .—Congress finds that— (1) the Commission was created to help fos-ter economic opportunity and close health and educational disparities in a geographic region of the United States beleaguered by persistent poverty and high unemployment; (2) the Commission remains the sole Fed-eral agency focused singularly on economic revitalization in the Appalachian region; (3) in 1998, Congress charged the Commis-sion with ‘‘address[ing] the needs of severely and persistently distressed areas of the Ap-palachian region and focus[ing] special at-tention on the areas of greatest need’’; (4) the Commission has long been criticized for its shortcomings in fulfilling this mis-sion, including in— (A) a 1999 study titled ‘‘Mountain Money: Federal Tax Dollars Miss the Mark in Core Appalachia’’ by Mark Ferenchik and Jill Ripenhoff for the Columbus Dispatch; and (B) a 2008 book titled ‘‘Uneven Ground: Ap-palachia Since 1945’’ by Ronald D. Eller; (5) in 2004, the Office of Management and Budget noted the importance of the Commis-sion ‘‘[f]ocusing efforts on...targeting assist-ance to areas of distress’’; (6) in 2017, Citizens Against Government Waste characterized the programming of the Commission as duplicative and called for drastic reductions in the budget of the Com-mission; (7) in 2017, the Office of Management and Budget, citing a Government Accountability Office study, concluded that the Commission should be abolished, and that conclusion was reflected in the fiscal year 2018 budget re-quest submitted by the President; (8) these recent actions reflect a growing chorus that the Commission should be re-formed; and (9) therefore, given the long-recognized shortcomings of the Commission, the long- standing criticism of the Commission, and the need to ensure its optimal performance, the time has arrived for the Commission to be reformed. (c) PERSISTENT POVERTY .—Congress finds that— (1) using 1960 data, the Commission (which was created in 1965) concluded that there were 214 distressed counties in the Appa-lachian region; (2) in 2017, according to the Commission, there are 84 distressed counties in the Appa-lachian region, reflecting the areas of most persistent poverty in the region; and (3) therefore, the Commission should be re-formed to focus its attention on the areas of most persistent poverty in the region. (d) A
REA DEVELOPMENT FUNDING FOR DIS-
TRESSED COUNTIES .—Congress finds that— (1) according to the study by the Columbus Dispatch referred to in subsection (b)(4)(A), of the 22,169 grants issued by the Commission from fiscal year 1966 through fiscal year 1998, none of the 5 counties that received the most Commission funding was considered dis-tressed, and more than 
1⁄4of all Commission spending during that period went to States with few, if any, distressed counties; (2) according to author Ronald D. Eller in 2014, ‘‘[the Commission] policies have con-centrated resources in a select few ‘growth centers’ in the [Appalachian] region, expand-ing services to the poor and growing the mountain middle class, but doing little to alter conditions in the most rural distressed counties or to address systemic political or economic inequalities throughout Appa-lachia’’; (3) until 1995, the Commission allocated up to 20 percent of its area development grants for use in distressed counties; (4) following instructions given to the Commission by the Committees on Appro-priations of the Senate and the House of Representatives in 1995, this allocation was increased by the Commission to 30 percent; (5) section 7.5(c) of the Code of the Com-mission (as in effect on the date of enact-ment of this Act) reflects this 1995 policy change and states that the Commission ‘‘will allocate up to 30 percent of Commission area development funds for use in distressed coun-ties’’, even though, according to the Com-mission’s public representations, economic conditions in distressed areas of the Appa-lachian region have not greatly improved since the 1960s; (6) given the persistent levels of poverty in the distressed counties in the Appalachian region, more area development funding and emphasis should be devoted to those coun-ties; and (7) therefore, the allocation described in paragraph (3) should be increased to 60 per-cent. (e) GRANT EXPENDITURES .—Congress finds that— (1) section 14524(d) of title 40, United States Code, provides that ‘‘not less than 50 percent of the amount of grant expenditures the Commission approves shall support activi-ties or projects that benefit severely and per-sistently distressed counties and areas’’; (2) given the persistent levels of poverty in the distressed counties in the Appalachian region, more grant expenditures and empha-sis should be devoted to those counties; and (3) therefore, the 50 percent threshold in section 14524(d) of title 40, United States Code, should be increased to 60 percent. 
SEC. 3. MISSION OF THE APPALACHIAN RE-GIONAL COMMISSION. 
Section 14301 of title 40, United States Code, is amended by striking subsection (a) and inserting the following: ‘‘(a) E
STABLISHMENT AND MISSION .— ‘‘(1) E
STABLISHMENT .—There is an Appa-lachian Regional Commission (referred to in this chapter as the ‘Commission’). ‘‘(2) M
ISSION .—The mission of the Commis-sion shall be to focus primarily on poverty reduction and economic development in areas in the Appalachian region with the most persistent poverty.’’. 
SEC. 4. HEADQUARTERS OF THE APPALACHIAN REGIONAL COMMISSION. 
(a) I NGENERAL .—Section 14301 of title 40, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following: ‘‘(g) H
EADQUARTERS .—The headquarters of the Commission shall be located in the Appa-lachian region.’’. (b) I
MPLEMENTATION .—The Federal Co-chairman of the Commission shall take such actions as may be necessary to carry out the amendment made by subsection (a).

SEC. 6. AREA DEVELOPMENT FUNDS FOR DIS-TRESSED COUNTIES. 
Section 14526(b) of title 40, United States Code, is amended— (1) by striking ‘‘In program and’’ and in-serting the following: ‘‘(1) I
N GENERAL .—In program and’’; and (2) by adding at the end the following: ‘‘(2) A
REA DEVELOPMENT FUNDS .— ‘‘(A) I

This bill makes voting in Federal elections easier and more accessible through one simple change: moving Election Day from Tuesday to the following Saturday and Sunday in November of an election year. We know from surveys and common sense that Tuesday voting stands in the way of greater voter participation. In 1845, Congress set Tuesday as Elec-tion Day because it was the easiest day for farmers—then travelling by horse and buggy—to make it to the polls in the course of their regular Tuesday trips to bring goods to market. Tues-day voting has no such benefit for farmers, or anyone else, in the 21st Century. It does, however, force many Americans to choose between their workday and family responsibilities, and participation in our democratic process. According to the Pew Research Cen-ter, voter turnout in the United States regularly lags behind other developed countries, many of which hold elec-tions on one or more days during the weekend. According to U.S. Census data, the most consistent reason Amer-icans give for not voting is that they are too busy to get away from their daily lives to make it to the polls. The Weekend Voting Act would give Americans the ability to vote during times that make better sense for them. Rather than on a Tuesday, polls would stay open during the first Saturday and Sunday after the first Friday in November of an election year. States would retain full autonomy to continue to offer alternatives to Election Day voting, such as early voting or voting by mail, and States are encouraged to give special consideration to accommo-date weekend religious practices. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the Weekend Voting Act so that more Americans can take part in our democratic process by voting at times that work for them.

S.

Patrick, William ‘‘Billy’’ Mitchell, Benjamin D. Foulois, Frank M. Andrews, Henry H. ‘‘Hap’’ Arnold, James H. ‘‘Jimmy’’ Doolittle, and Edward ‘‘Eddie’’ Rickenbacker, were among the first individuals to recognize the military poten-tial of airpower and, in the decades following World War I, courageously laid the founda-tion for the creation of an independent arm for the air forces of the United States; Whereas, on June 20, 1941, the Department of War created the Army Air Forces as the aviation element of that Department and, shortly thereafter, the Department made the Army Air Forces co-equal to the Army Ground Forces; Whereas General Henry H. ‘‘Hap’’ Arnold drew upon the industrial prowess and human resources of the United States to transform the Army Air Corps from a force of 22,400 men and 2,402 aircraft in 1939 into an entity with a peak wartime strength of 2,400,000 personnel and 79,908 aircraft; Whereas the standard for courage, flexi-bility, and intrepidity in combat was estab-lished for all Airmen during the first aerial raid in the Pacific Theater on April 18, 1942, when Lieutenant Colonel James ‘‘Jimmy’’ H.

Doolittle led 16 North American B–25 Mitch-ell bombers in a joint operation from the deck of the USS Hornet to strike the Japa-nese mainland in response to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor; Whereas the National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 3001 et seq.), signed into law by President Harry S. Truman, realigned and reorganized the Armed Forces to establish the Department of the Air Force (referred to in this preamble as the ‘‘USAF’’) as separate from other military services; Whereas, on September 18, 1947, W. Stuart Symington became the first Secretary of the newly formed and independent USAF, mark-ing the date on which the USAF was estab-lished; Whereas, on September 26, 1947, General Carl A. Spaatz, a pioneering aviator and former Commanding General of the Army Air Forces, became the first Chief of Staff of the USAF; Whereas the Air National Guard was also created by the National Security Act of 1947 and has played a vital role in guarding the United States and defending freedom in near-ly every major conflict and contingency since its creation; Whereas, on October 14, 1947, the USAF demonstrated the historic and ongoing com-mitment of the USAF to technological inno-vation when Captain Charles ‘‘Chuck’’ Yeager piloted the X–1 developmental rocket plane to a speed of Mach 1.07, becoming the first flyer to break the sound barrier in a powered aircraft in level flight; Whereas the Air Force Reserve, created on April 14, 1948, is comprised of citizen airmen who serve as unrivaled wingmen of the ac-tive duty USAF during every deployment and on every mission and battlefield around the world in which the USAF is engaged; Whereas the USAF carried out the Berlin Airlift in 1948 and 1949 to provide humani-tarian relief to post-war Germany and has established a tradition of offering humani-tarian assistance when responding to natural disasters and needs across the world; Whereas the Tuskegee Airmen served the United States with tremendous dignity and honor, overcame segregation and prejudice to become one of the most highly respected fighter groups of World War II, and helped to establish a policy of racial integration with-in the ranks of the USAF, as, on April 26, 1948, the USAF became the first military branch to integrate, a full 3 months before an Executive order integrated all military services; Whereas, in the early years of the Cold War, the arsenal of bombers of the USAF, such as the long-range Convair B–58 Hustler and B–36 Peacemaker, and the Boeing B–47 Stratojet and B–52 Stratofortress, under the command of General Curtis LeMay, served as the preeminent deterrent of the United States against the forces of the Soviet Union and were later augmented by the develop-ment and deployment of medium range and intercontinental ballistic missiles, such as the Titan and Minuteman, developed by Gen-eral Bernard A. Schriever; Whereas, on April 1, 1954, President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed legislation estab-lishing the United States Air Force Acad-emy, the mission of which is to educate, de-velop, and inspire men and women to become aerospace officers and leaders of impeccable character and knowledge, and that, as of 2017, has graduated 59 classes and 49,700 ca-dets; Whereas, during the Korean War, the USAF employed the first large-scale combat use of jet aircraft, helped to establish air su-periority over the Korean Peninsula, pro-tected ground forces of the United Nations with close air support, and interdicted enemy reinforcements and supplies; Whereas, after the development of launch vehicles and orbital satellites, the mission of the USAF expanded into space and, as of 2017, provides exceptional support with re-spect to real-time global communications, environmental monitoring, navigation, pre-cision timing, missile warning, nuclear de-terrence, and space surveillance; Whereas, during the Vietnam War, the USAF engaged in a limited campaign of air-power to assist the South Vietnamese gov-ernment in countering the communist Viet Cong guerillas and fought to disrupt supply lines, halt enemy ground offensives, and pro-tect United States and Allied forces; Whereas, on April 3, 1967, former prisoner of war Paul W. Airey, a career radio oper-ator, aerial gunner, and First Sergeant, be-came the first Chief Master Sergeant of the USAF; Whereas, in recent decades, the USAF and coalition partners of the United States have supported successful actions in Grenada, Panama, Iraq, Kuwait, Somalia, Bosnia- Herzegovina, Haiti, Kosovo, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria, and many other locations around the world;

Whereas, for 27 consecutive years begin-ning in 1990, Airmen have— (1) been engaged in continuous combat op-erations ranging from Operation Desert Shield to the Global War on Terrorism to Op-eration Inherent Resolve; and (2) shown that the Airmen constitute an air and space expeditionary force of out-standing capability and are ready to fight and win wars for the United States when and where they are called upon; Whereas, when terrorists attacked the United States on September 11, 2001, fighter and air refueling aircraft of the USAF took to the skies to fly combat air patrols over major cities of the United States and pro-tected the families, friends, and neighbors of the people of the United States from further attack; Whereas, on December 7, 2005, the USAF modified its mission statement to include flying and fighting in air, space, and cyber-space and prioritized the innovation, operationalization, and sustainment of warfighting capabilities to deliver unre-stricted access to cyberspace to defend the United States and its worldwide interests; Whereas women have played a prominent role in the evolution of the USAF, coura-geously fighting alongside their male coun-terparts and dedicating their lives to pro-tecting peace, liberty, and freedom around the world as they provide ‘‘ready to fight to-night’’ airpower whenever and wherever needed; Whereas, as of 2017, the USAF has made tremendous strides in the global warfighting domain of cyberspace by revolutionizing of-fensive and defensive capabilities and effects with speed, agility, and surgical precision, thereby ensuring the continuous command, control, and execution of joint and service operations in contested, degraded, and lim-ited environments; Whereas the untapped potential of enlisted aviators is recognized by the USAF as these highly trained, intelligent, and professional Airmen fly remotely piloted aircraft to dis-tant skies in support of combatant com-manders and meet the insatiable demand for persistent intelligence, surveillance, and re-connaissance capabilities; Whereas the Civil Air Patrol, as a total force partner and auxiliary of the USAF, has maintained a steadfast commitment to the United States and the communities of the United States through a proud legacy of service, from the earliest days of World War II, when the Civil Air Patrol protected the shorelines of the United States, through 2017, as the Civil Air Patrol executes emergency service missions; Whereas the USAF is steadfast in the com-mitment to fielding a world-class air expedi-tionary force by recruiting, training, and educating its officer, enlisted, and civilian corps comprising the active duty, Air Na-tional Guard, and Air Force Reserve compo-nents of the USAF; Whereas more than 100,000 Airmen stand watch around the world at 175 global loca-tions, committed to winning the constant fight against violent extremist organizations by expending more than 56,000 munitions and striking more than 32,000 enemy targets over the course of 18,200 airstrikes; Whereas Airmen were imprisoned and tor-tured during several major conflicts, includ-ing World War I, World War II, the Vietnam War, the Korean War, and the Persian Gulf War, and, in the valiant tradition of Airmen held captive, continued serving the United States with honor and dignity under the most inhumane circumstances; Whereas Airmen have earned the Medal of Honor 18 times, the Air Force Cross 183 times, the Distinguished Service Cross 42 times, and the Silver Star 74 times; Whereas the USAF is a tremendous stew-ard of resources, develops and applies groundbreaking technology, manages com-plex acquisition programs, and maintains test, evaluation, and sustainment criteria for all USAF weapon systems throughout the life cycles of those weapon systems; Whereas talented and dedicated Airmen will continue to meet the future challenges of an ever-changing world with limitless strength, resolve, and patriotism; Whereas, on every continent around the world, the USAF has bravely fought for free-dom, liberty, and peace, preserved democ-racy, and protected the people and interests of the United States; Whereas Airmen of the USAF, together with their joint force partners, will continue to be a tremendous resource for the United States in fights across every domain and at every location, delivering continuous air and space superiority, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, rapid global mobility, global strike, and command and control ca-pabilities, thereby ensuring the safety and security of the United States; and Whereas, for 70 years, the USAF and the Airmen of the USAF, through their exem-plary service and sacrifice, have repeatedly proven their value to the United States, the people of the United States, the allies of the United States, and all free people of the world: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Senate— (1) commemorates the 70th anniversary of the establishment of the Air Force as an independent military service; and (2) remembers, honors, and commends the achievements of the Air Force in serving and defending the United States through global vigilance, global reach, and global power. f

HEALTHCARE Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, it has been over 7 weeks since the Senate voted on three different versions of the Republican bill to repeal the Afford-able Care Act. Each of these terrible bills would have stripped healthcare coverage from tens of millions of Americans and raised costs for millions more. During this 7 weeks that followed the last of those votes, no one has clam-ored for another try. Phones aren’t ringing off the hook with calls for Re-publicans to go one more round in their effort to rip up the Medicaid Program. Letters and emails aren’t pouring in asking for legislation to jack up the costs for people with preexisting condi-tions. Tweets and Facebook posts don’t demand that insurers get the chance to drop coverage for mental health issues and addiction treatment. Instead, the families I have spoken with have told me, often through tears, that they are so relieved that Repub-licans stepped back from the brink and came to their senses. They are breath-ing just a little bit easier knowing that Medicaid will be there for their elderly parent in a nursing home or the neigh-bor down the street who uses a wheel-chair. That tight, anxious, terrifying feeling in their chests has eased up be-cause they don’t have to worry about losing the health insurance that helps pay for their asthma medication or their children’s heart surgery. Here we are again, back on the floor of the Senate, engaged in a terrible and familiar ritual: begging the Repub-licans not to gut our health insurance system for the sake of political games. If the American people want these cruel repeal bills to be thrown in the garbage, where they belong, then what are we doing here? Well, Senate Repub-licans are pretty desperate. This month, they learned from the Senate Parliamentarian—the independent um-pire here in the Senate who gets the final say on how the procedural rules work—that the legislative instructions they passed back in January to kick off their whole effort to repeal the Af-fordable Care Act will expire on Sep-tember 30. Once that happens, Repub-licans would have to start over with a new set of instructions if they want to be able to use the special Senate rules that allow them to jam this bill through without a single Democratic vote. So the Republicans have dug through the trash and pulled out an old draft of a bill they think could get the job done. It is called the Cassidy-Gra-ham proposal, named after the Repub-lican Senators who put it together. You might think that after months and months of failed attempts, the Re-publicans would have something new to offer. You might think that after their last three terrible repeal bills went up in flames, the Republicans would pro-pose something more reasonable this time around. You might think that— but no. This is just the same terrible set of policies with a fresh coat of paint and a new name. The Cassidy-Graham proposal com-pletely eliminates the parts of the ACA that help families afford health insur-ance. Do you think insurance is expen-sive right now? Just wait for Cassidy- Graham. Need help paying for your chemotherapy or your surgery? Good luck. Cassidy-Graham says you are on your own. What about all the people who count on Medicaid to help out, people who have health insurance but have a baby who was born 8 weeks too early and who now needs breathing equipment and special therapists; people who worked hard all their lives but who couldn’t save enough to make it three decades in a nursing home; people who use a wheelchair or need a home health aide to come by so they can live inde-pendently? What happens to them? Well, with massive cuts to Medicaid, the latest Republican proposal turns America’s back on babies, on seniors, on people with disabilities, on our fam-ilies and our friends and our neighbors who need our help. I could go on and on about this, but let’s get one thing straight about this latest Republican plan: It is not more reasonable. It is not more moderate. It is not bipartisan. And it is definitely not something that families in this country want. It is just another version of the same old cruel, heartless, shame-less plan that Republicans have spent the last 8 months trying to jam down the throats of the American people. Don’t take my word for it. Doctors’ groups, including the American Acad-emy of Pediatrics, the American Acad-emy of Family Physicians, and a bunch of other medical specialities, pulled the fire alarm last week when Cassidy and Graham released their proposal. They sent Congress a letter saying it could cost millions of Americans their healthcare coverage. They begged Re-publicans not to start down this road again. Instead, the doctors asked Con-gress to do something that makes a whole lot more sense: Focus on ways to improve health insurance markets in this country, starting with the discus-sions that have taken place in the HELP Committee over the last 2 weeks. That is because there is another important end-of-September deadline coming up—the date when insurance companies have to set their prices for next year’s insurance premiums. Over the last couple of weeks, the two Senators who run the HELP Com-mittee—Senator ALEXANDER on the Re-publican side and Senator M
URRAY on the Democratic side—have held a series of hearings on policies that we could pass before the end of September to help lower premiums and make sure that when you buy health insurance, you get coverage that actually means something. I sit on that committee, and, like most of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I have been to each of the four hearings we held on this issue. Senators A
LEXANDER and M URRAY  have also opened up the discussion to every single Senator so that even those not assigned to the committee can come and meet the witnesses and talk about how to make healthcare better. We have traded ideas. We have talked to Governors. We talked to State insur-ance commissioners. We talked to doc-tors and to patients. And not everyone sees things exactly the same way. We have argued back and forth and put a lot of different ideas on the table. We have spent hours talking about how to improve healthcare in this country. We have 12 days left before the end of September. It is not always this sim-ple, but this time there really is a clear tradeoff. We can either use those 12 days to let Republicans burn down healthcare in this country, or we can use those 12 days to pass a bill that would stabilize healthcare coverage for millions of Americans. The Republicans are hoping to slip below the radar screen, to sneak the re-peal of healthcare coverage across the finish line just when we let down our guard. Well, I have news for the Repub-licans who want to go down this road: I see you. The American people see you. And we will fight you every step of the way, for as long as it takes and for as many more rounds as you want to go, to stop your ugly bill in its

tracks. We will not give up on the fam-ilies who are counting on us to defend their healthcare. We will not back down. We will not blink. Here is the thing Republicans just don’t seem to realize: We aren’t tired. We don’t get tired when we are fighting for kids on ventilators. We don’t lose heart when we are lining up on the side of moms with breast cancer or grand-parents with Alzheimer’s. We never ever run out of steam when we are fighting for people’s lives. We are here today and tomorrow and every day, and we will fight back as hard as we need to for as long as it takes to defeat every single attempt to take away healthcare from millions of families in this country. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Wisconsin. Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues in expressing ac-tually a combination of outrage and heartbreak that Washington is still working on yet another partisan plan to take healthcare coverage and guar-anteed protections away from families across this country. This is despite a clear message Americans—and Wiscon-sinites alike—have sent to Congress that they want us to work across the party aisle to make things better and not worse. This latest repeal plan to-tally ignores that message. This plan would make things far worse, not better. It would make things worse by allowing insurers to charge older Americans an age tax. That is a worry that Greg from Stod-dard, WI, has shared with me. Greg told me that he and his family can’t afford for things to get worse. He has no idea how he and other older Wisconsinites will be able to afford higher costs for healthcare. Greg’s sons, both of them, have diabetes, and they are already struggling with the skyrocketing cost of insulin. It would make things worse by dra-matically weakening guaranteed pro-tections for those with preexisting con-ditions, allowing insurers to cut cov-erage for essential health benefits and charge more for needed care. As some-one who was branded with those words ‘‘preexisting condition’’ as a child, I understand how this repeal would hurt Wisconsin families and families throughout America. It would make things worse by elimi-nating the premium tax credits and cost-sharing reduction payments that help thousands—thousands—of Wiscon-sinites afford healthcare coverage, and estimates show this particular plan of-fered in the Senate could significantly cut funding for my home State of Wis-consin by almost $3 billion in the year 2027. On top of this latest repeal plan, it has to be added that the Trump admin-istration continues to play dangerous political games and engage in sabotage against the Affordable Care Act and Wisconsin’s healthcare system, and it does so at the expense of families seek-ing affordable insurance. Instead of working to lower healthcare costs, the Trump administration continues to threaten to withhold the critical cost- sharing reduction payments that help reduce deductibles and out-of-pocket costs for Wisconsin families. Instead of giving healthcare providers certainty and working to stabilize the healthcare marketplace, the Trump administra-tion is laying the groundwork for high-er premiums next year. In addition, just last week, the ad-ministration slashed funding to States for their outreach and education ef-forts to help more people sign up for healthcare. Wisconsin’s trusted Navi-gator Programs had their funding cut, without explanation, by almost 50 per-cent, despite a long record of actually exceeding their enrollment goals. This would mean fewer people in rural Wis-consin will receive the support and as-sistance they need to obtain affordable healthcare coverage. Instead of making things worse, we should be making things better by get-ting the job done on bipartisan solu-tions that lower costs, that expand coverage, and make healthcare more affordable. The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-sions—the HELP Committee—is trying to do just that. Chairman A
LEXANDER and Ranking Member M
URRAY have shown great leadership in bringing us together to work across party lines on solutions that work for the American people. Our committee has heard from leaders from across the country. These are leaders and experts who play different roles in the healthcare system, and they are telling us how we can work together to make things better. We have had a set of four hearings over the last 2 weeks, and throughout these hearings we have received a con-sistent message. That message is that now is the time to work together to stabilize the health insurance market and to make healthcare more afford-able. I believe we need to be doing more to increase the enrollment of younger and healthier adults in the marketplace. We should be exploring bipartisan solu-tions to increase outreach and cov-erage for those over 6.1 million young adults who are still uninsured. Slash-ing the funding for outreach, edu-cation, and assistance to them will fur-ther destabilize the market and lead to higher costs for everyone. It is past time to stop this partisan nonsense. I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to do just that by ending these partisan attempts to take people’s healthcare away and make them pay more for less care. The people of Wisconsin—frankly, the people across this country—have sent a clear message. They have sent a clear message that they don’t want us to take people’s healthcare away, and they have sent a clear message that they want us to work together, to work across the party line to make things better, not worse. I believe that if parties can look past this partisan debate, if we can do the people’s business, then we can find common ground. Let’s do that by get-ting the job done on bipartisan solu-tions that stabilize and strengthen the healthcare marketplace. Let’s do that by getting the job done on solutions that would lower healthcare costs for all American families. Thank you. I yield the floor. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. MERKLEY. Thank you, Mr. President. Yogi Berra once said: ‘‘It’s like deja vu, all over again.’’ Here we are feeling the echoes of the recent debates over healthcare, yet we have another Re-publican plan to dismantle healthcare and the peace of mind of millions of Americans coming to the floor. We have seen previous plans. We have seen the House bill that was going to wipe out healthcare for 24 million peo-ple. We saw the bill that came over from the Senate in June wipe out healthcare for 22 million people. Then we saw the Republicans’ improved version of that, wiping out healthcare for 32 million people. In July of this year, there was yet another plan, back to 22 million—millions and millions of people losing their healthcare. Now we have one more last-ditch effort to de-stroy healthcare for ordinary Ameri-cans, for rural Americans, for working Americans. It is just wrong, and I am going to ex-plain some of the reasons all of us should be outraged by this bill—this new bill, which says immediately the individual mandate and the company mandate are wiped out. What does that do? That means instantly, in 2018 and 2019, there is a destructive race to the bottom for the insurance pools. If there is no pool, if there is no mandate, then only those who are sicker sign up. Those who are sicker are more expen-sive, so then more people drop out of the healthcare pool, and the pool be-comes even more expensive. It just shoots right out of sight. We are not talking just about dam-age that would be done in 2020; we are talking about damage that would be done next year and the year after. What happens when the insurance companies say there are only 2 years left on this, and the healthcare pool has a big hole in it, the healthy people are gushing out, and only the sickest people remain? They are going to drop out of providing coverage. Suddenly, we have hundreds of counties across

the Nation with no healthcare provi-sion for those who are currently in the healthcare marketplace. We have been through this conversa-tion. We have been through the Ted Cruz fake insurance bill, and it was voted down by this body with a sub-stantial bipartisan majority. This is a repeat of that, saying let’s destroy those insurance pools. What else does this bill destroy? In 2020, it destroys the tax credits. Let’s say you were fortunate enough to have the pool survive 2018 and 2019 and you have tax credits that enable you to buy insurance and there is still a provider during those 2 years, but then comes 2020, and there are no tax credits with which to buy insurance so now you are thrown out of healthcare. There is no remedy provided in this bill. Is it possible that you are going to get covered by the Medicaid Program in your State? Well, it is not likely be-cause Medicaid in most States provides insurance for poorer Americans, not for the folks who are getting the tax cred-its in the exchange. No, they are out of luck. What else do we have? The elimi-nation of essential benefits. Essential benefits are no longer required. Now, we have some history with this in our country. We have had those fake insur-ance policies that you buy that cost virtually nothing, and then you get sick and discover that your trip to the emergency room isn’t covered or you discover your hospitalization is not covered. Your child gets injured—they break a bone—and you discover the x rays are not covered, and the lab tests are not covered. Well, these are the fake insurance policies that don’t be-long anywhere because they are simply a fraud. This is a scam. Why are we returning to a vote on fake insurance? Not only do we lose the individual mandate and the company mandate that makes sure an insurance pool—it is the pool having both sick and healthy people so insurance com-panies can actually provide insurance, but we also have this provision of this fake insurance, where you have a pol-icy that costs virtually nothing and then covers nothing. So it is sold to those who are vulnerable by the sales pitch of the scam man. What else does this do? Well, right now we have this very complicated healthcare system. It is a big improve-ment over what we had 8 years ago, but it is still complicated. We have Med-icaid, and we have Medicare. We have on-exchanges, and we have off-ex-changes. We have special insurance for the workplace called Workers’ Com-pensation. We have special insurance for children called the Children’s Health Insurance Program. We have workplace policies that have very good benefits covered by the company, and we have workplace policies that are very poor policies. We have workplace policies that are paid for by the com-pany, and there are those where the in-dividual has to buy into the workplace policy. Then, we have policies that cover just the worker and ones that cover the family. What do you do as you navigate this incredibly complex array? This is a continuous stressful journey for Americans. Maybe you have a job that doesn’t pay very much, and you are able to be on the Oregon Health Plan or on simi-lar Medicaid programs across the coun-try. Then, you earn a little bit more or your spouse earns a little bit more, and, suddenly, you don’t qualify. How do you get onto the exchange in the middle of the year? How do you work out those tax credits for the end of the year? Or maybe your next job provides insurance for you but not your chil-dren. How do you get your children signed up? It is a very, very stressful situation—this complicated, overlap-ping healthcare that requires contin-uous attention just for people to make sure that, if their loved one is sick, if their child is injured, they will get the care they need when that happens and the family will not end up bankrupt. It is a pursuit of peace of mind. What does this bill do? It makes our already complicated system even more complicated. It says in this bill: We want to have 50 different systems for 50 different States—so much for focusing on a simpler system where we can work to drive out any fraud or inefficiencies or abuse. No, now we have 50 systems pursuing different forms of fraud, waste, and abuse. We should be going in the other direction toward sim-plicity, toward a world in which, just by virtue of being an American, you know you are covered. You don’t have to worry about that transition from job to job or that change as you go from one income to another income or the dynamics that occur should you get married or get divorced. No, just by virtue of being an American, you are covered. That is the way the whole de-veloped world does it. They make it easy, but here we make it complicated, and this bill is determined to make it much more complicated, much more fractured, and much more stressful. So let’s not do that. Let’s apply a little common sense and recognize that none of us would run a business determined to make the workplace more stressful, more frac-tured, less efficient, and more filled with fraud. But that is what this bill does. So let’s say no. Let’s have a huge bi-partisan response to say absolutely not. Now, it is grassroots America that defeated those previous diabolical plans to wipe out healthcare for mil-lions of Americans. They filled the streets. Grassroots America overflowed our inboxes. They flooded our phones, and, once again, we need the common sense of working America, of grass-roots America to weigh in and say how wrong this proposed bill is. During the previous debate, I kept noting that this was like a monster that you can only put away by driving a stake through its heart. Each time we attempted to have that debate on the floor and we defeated the bill, I thought: Well, perhaps, we finally put this monster 6 feet under. But now it is back in all its ruthless, tooth-and-fang fury, ready to destroy peace of mind in healthcare for our citizens. So let’s take a vote in this Senate that will do what we hoped we had done before and truly drive a stake through the heart of this TrumpCare proposition. Let’s stand up in partner-ship with our citizens. Oh, I know this room is full of really wealthy Americans who have never worried about healthcare. When I was first campaigning for the Senate, I met with one of those really wealthy Amer-icans in New York City. He said to me: I don’t know why you are saying you are fighting for better healthcare. Ev-erybody in America has good healthcare. Well, that is because that individual lived in a bubble, where he was sur-rounded by everyone he knew having good healthcare because they worked for really wealthy firms in New York City. They are so dramatically discon-nected from the reality of working Americans. I will tell you what is going on in my neighborhood, in my blue collar neigh-borhood—the same neighborhood that I went to from grades 3 through 12, the same neighborhood that my children went to. It is getting tougher to find a full-time job. It is getting tougher to find a living-wage job. It is getting tougher to be able to save and to help your child pursue their dreams. It is tougher to be able to help your family or, perhaps, to go on a vacation—even a simple vacation—and it is certainly tougher to buy a home. In fact, many people in my neighborhood feel that the only way they are going to be able to buy a home is to inherit it from their parents. But I will tell you that there is one thing that got easier in the last 8 years against all that—one thing—and that was that we provided expansion of Med-icaid to cover a lot more people and we created a marketplace for insurance where working people could use tax credits to be able to buy care and to easily compare policies. So we made a big step forward in one single area—in one area. Now my colleagues from their gated communities and with their 7-digit wealth want to come and de-stroy the one thing we did for working Americans. If President Trump cared one whit about a working American, he would be ringing up the majority leader of this Chamber right now and saying: What are you doing? I campaigned saying I was going to stand with workers. This bill attacks them. What are you doing? He would be calling up and saying: I called that House bill mean—that House bill which eliminated healthcare for 23 million Americans—the final bill. I called it mean and heartless. This is meaner. This is even more heartless.

This is coming about because of a cri-sis. In January of this year, leading from December, we have had people—like Standard & Poor’s—talking about how stable these exchanges were. Over the last months, we have seen many ac-tions—threatening cost-sharing, not advertising the markets—many actions taken by the Trump administration that have weakened the markets and put the markets in crisis. But it is ac-tually not the markets that are in cri-sis; it is fellow Americans. People want the same thing. Whether Republican or Democrat, from the West, East, North, South, or the heart of our country, they want the same thing: They want quality, affordable care. We have come a long way to where we are right now. Under the Affordable Care Act, we have increased the num-ber of Americans with health insurance by over 20 million. We have been able to bend the cost curve. The Affordable Care Act has taken us out of days that no American—very few—wants us to go back to, the days where people could be denied coverage based on a preexisting condition. The Affordable Care Act created an essential set of benefits, which Ameri-cans from both sides of the aisle think is very important. These essential ben-efits include such things as healthcare for women who are having children. They include things like putting parity between mental healthcare and what might be called physical healthcare. There have been so many improve-ments because of the Affordable Care Act, and I have heard about them from constituents all over my State, as well as voices from around the United States of America, difficult stories about people who had lifetime caps; people who, because their child had an illness as a child—when that child be-came an adult, they couldn’t find in-surance; people who were being denied insurance because of a preexisting con-dition; people who were declaring bankruptcy in this country, at rates significantly higher than we are seeing now, because they could not afford their health insurance. In fact, per-sonal bankruptcy in our Nation has been cut by about 50 percent. These are all gains we have achieved through the Affordable Care Act. There is the ex-pansion of healthcare to millions more and the security of knowing that your health insurance won’t be cut off be-cause of a preexisting condition, know-ing that when you pay for health cov-erage, it will carry essential benefits that every American should get. There are these gains and many more. What has happened after the failure of TrumpCare, after the failure of Re-publican plans—what actually came out of that was something that was en-couraging to me as a Senator who has been here for 3-plus years: seeing statespeople from our Senate—L
AMAR  A
LEXANDER and Senator M URRAY — come together and say: Hey, we have a crisis in our country. Some of these markets are losing stability. We should work together, put aside partisan dif-ferences, and try to find a pathway for-ward to make sure that in some States millions of folks don’t lose health in-surance. We heard—at least I did—some of the best commentary in this body. Perhaps most notable was a speech by J
OHN M
CCAIN, who stood up and strongly talked about regular order, talked about us doing things in the Senate in a way that brought us together, that invited in the public, that had a wide range of people participating in the crafting of policy—policy that affects nearly 20 percent of our economy, pol-icy that affects hundreds of millions of Americans, policy that is critical to the success of our Nation. I am grateful that Senators M
URRAY  and A
LEXANDER have been holding bi-partisan hearings to try to stabilize the marketplace. Through this process, over the past month, we have had bi-partisan Governors—Governors from both parties—insurance commis-sioners, consumers—all have had the opportunity to come in and begin to weigh in on different proposals and their impact on the health insurance marketplace. This shows we can work together to try to improve the Afford-able Care Act—not this idea that we throw it out, hurting not just a few people but literally tens of millions of Americans. This is the way it should be done. Past proposals that have failed in this body were done the wrong way— people crafting legislation behind closed doors in a noninclusive manner, in a partisan manner, not holding hear-ings, not bringing in experts. That is not the way this body was meant to work. In fact, for those who criticized the Affordable Care Act, for the Affordable Care Act, there were dozens of bipar-tisan hearings. Over 100 amendments from the Republican Party were in-cluded in the ultimate legislation. It was a process that took months and months. The President of the United States even met with Republican Sen-ators and Congresspeople to discuss and debate the legislation, and it was aired on C–SPAN. This showed the best of who we are, that when we come to-gether as a body and go through a proc-ess, good legislation—not perfect legis-lation but good legislation—can ad-vance us toward our principles. Those principles were principles that were discussed during the last Presidential campaign by both candidates. Donald Trump himself, our President, said time and time again: I want us to have a health system in which everyone is covered, in which everyone has afford-able and quality healthcare. These values aren’t debatable, and I am disappointed, I am frustrated, and I am angry that we are here again while a bipartisan process is going on, and, as a great New Jerseyan, Yogi Berra, once said, it is deja vu all over again. Here we are now coming back this week, and we are hearing about an-other Republican bill that has not gone through regular order, that has not had hearings, that has not had a bipartisan process. Another bill is coming to the floor. People are whipping up votes, and we might have yet another dra-matic moment in this body that mil-lions of Americans will watch, holding their breaths because their families— their children, their senior citizen par-ents—are being held in the balance on a decision this body will make—not going through regular order, not bring-ing in experts—on legislation that hasn’t even been scored by the Con-gressional Budget Office. The CBO hasn’t scored this bill. We don’t know what its total impact would be on health coverage or on costs. We don’t know exactly how many people could lose their coverage, how much premiums could skyrocket for the middle class, and just how much Medicaid would ultimately be gutted. This is the bill that is coming before us. This is the threat right now to our Nation and to millions of people. But we do know enough about this bill, and previous versions of the repeal plan that looked very similar to this bill give us many hints—more than hints— give us much evidence about what this bill would do and how this bill would cause millions to lose their coverage and premiums to skyrocket. And the millions who rely on Medicaid for ev-erything from opioid addiction treat-ment to maternity care would suffer. Let me go through some things we know about this legislation which is being threatened to be brought to the Senate floor and which now casts a

shadow over the coverage earned and gained by millions of Americans. This legislation would still take cov-erage away from millions of Ameri-cans. We know this destructive version—this partisan repeal plan— would take coverage away from mil-lions of people. Experts have already projected that after 10 years, this par-tisan repeal plan could cause over 30 million Americans to lose their cov-erage—30 million Americans cast back into a world where one illness, where one injury could devastate their fami-lies, could send them into bankruptcy. That one illness, that one injury could have the worst of results; could cast us back to a time when so many Ameri-cans were using emergency room doc-tors as their primary care physicians; could cast us back to a time when many Americans were delaying seeing doctors because they couldn’t afford to, allowing preventable diseases or treat-able diseases to get worse and worse. Thirty million Americans losing their health insurance means more Ameri-cans will die. That is not a dramatic, hyperbolic statement; that is the truth. When health coverage rates go down, American mortality rates go up. What else do we know about this leg-islation? It still raises costs like the other versions of TrumpCare. This version of this partisan repeal plan will still force hard-working Americans to pay more for, actually, worse care. It would abruptly end the critical as-sisted subsidies that have allowed mil-lions to afford care. It would end sup-port for people in the very market-places about which two other bipar-tisan Senators, through the HELP Committee, are trying to discuss how we are going to stabilize those markets to give people that very access. We know that as a result of this re-peal plan, Americans will see their deductibles increase by several thou-sand dollars. We could once again— once again, with those increases—see bankruptcy rates increase after drop-ping dramatically under the Affordable Care Act. What else do we know about this leg-islation, this newest version of TrumpCare? It still ends Federal pro-tections, as the other plans did, for people with preexisting conditions. TrumpCare’s latest version would still enable insurance companies to charge folks who are sick or who have been ill or who have a preexisting condition for their care. States could waive that re-striction on discrimination against people with preexisting conditions. This plan will still subject millions of Americans with those preexisting con-ditions to price discrimination, mean-ing Americans who may have had can-cer, Americans who are pregnant, Americans who have a child with au-tism could be forced to pay thousands and thousands of dollars more just to get coverage. What else does this newest piece of legislation do? It ends the Medicaid ex-pansion, and it establishes a per capita cap and reduction of Medicaid. By end-ing Medicaid as we know it after over 50 years of this program, by suddenly capping it and ultimately giving block grants to States, we know it will affect dramatically the people whom this pro-gram and these expansions have cov-ered. Who gets covered by Medicaid? Who will be affected? In America right now, over half of all low-income families rely on Medicaid. Two out of three of our seniors living in nursing homes rely on Medicaid. Half of all the births in the United States of America—our children, our future, our greatest nat-ural resource—half are covered by Med-icaid. Here is our reality. We are gutting a program that benefits us all—our sen-iors, our children, as well as the dis-abled. The cruel Medicaid cuts pro-posed in this bill—the cuts and the caps in this version—will still put those who have the most to lose in the most serious jeopardy: those seniors in nursing homes, working families, com-munities of color, women, Americans with disabilities, those folks who are already struggling with illness, elder Americans, Americans living in rural areas, Americans living in our cities. This is not who we are. These are not our values. This kind of draconian ac-tion is unacceptable in a nation this great. What else does it do, this newest version of TrumpCare? What else does it do? In this version, this bill—just like the ones before—still erodes crit-ical patient protections established by the Affordable Care Act by allowing States to apply for a waiver to opt out of the ACA’s essential benefits require-ment for things as basic as maternity care, substance abuse services, pre-scription drugs, emergency services, hospitalizations, and rehabilitation services. This repeal plan could essentially give insurers the green light to once again charge for junk insurance plans that don’t actually cover needed care. You may have health insurance, but it may be so limited and so constricted that when you actually get sick, you find out it does not cover your illness, your health challenge, your injury. This newest version of TrumpCare, this newest version of a partisan repeal plan, also still threatens women’s health. Women comprise two-thirds of all adult enrollees in Medicaid. They would be essentially hurt by the gut-ting of that program. This repeal plan, like previous versions, would still cut off low-income women from accessing critical preventive and healthcare serv-ices from Planned Parenthood, health centers that provide essential preven-tive care and, often in many counties, the only avenue to contraceptive serv-ices. It singles out Planned Parenthood by not allowing them to be reimbursed for basic health services, making it so much more difficult for women all around our country to access impor-tant care. What else does this most recent version of TrumpCare do, this partisan bill that is not going through regular order? Just like the other ones, it would still weaken the Federal prohibi-tion on lifetime limits, lifetime caps on the insurance that one can receive. That means Americans with chronic diseases and conditions and children with unique medical needs and chal-lenges who still need continued life-saving care could be forced, once they hit that cap, to spend hundreds of thou-sands of dollars on continued care, even though they are insured, thus dev-astating families, sending them into bankruptcy, spiraling them into finan-cial catastrophe. A couple of months back, one of my constituents tweeted me a photo of her son’s medical bill after a recent sur-gery. The bill was for $500, but it showed that without the coverage she got because of the Affordable Care Act, she would have owed over $230,000. That was just for her child’s heart surgery. Her son Ethan, who was born with a rare genetic disorder, has had four of those surgeries. Under this partisan plan, not only could essential health benefits, like hospitalizations and prescription drugs, be denied Ethan, but lifetime caps on coverage would disqualify Ethan from accessing the care he needs. As Ethan’s mom put it, the lifetime cap is the equivalent of saying: ‘‘Sorry, you’re not worth keeping alive any-more. You’re just too expensive.’’ That is what this plan would allow insurance companies to do, essentially saying to Americans: If you had a prob-lem when you were a child, if you had surgeries as a child, once you hit that cap, you are not worth covering any-more. We had a vote on the floor today. It was for national defense. It was a major bill. There were strong state-ments and speeches on both sides of the aisle. At the end of the day, the over-whelming majority of us joined to-gether to provide for our Nation’s na-tional defense; that is, to provide for our Defense Department. It is a common ideal in this body that this government, formed by our forefathers and foremothers, the Con-stitution upon which we stand pro-claims that this government was formed for the common good, for the common defense. As we have seen in recent days, the idea of defense isn’t just protecting us against the threat of North Korea, isn’t just protecting us from the efforts of the Russians. It is not just protecting us from terrorist organizations. We have seen that the national defense also means the challenges of natural disaster. It was profound for all of us to see the crisis faced from Texas to Florida and how we—as a nation, hero after hero in communities large and small— stood up during this time and were

there for fellow Americans, never ask-ing their party, never asking or ques-tioning what different religion they might have. People from all different ethnic backgrounds banded together because that is what Americans do. When we are threatened, when we are attacked, when there is a natural dis-aster or an enemy from afar, we stand up and take care of each other. The very formation and foundation of our government is based on the ideals that we are stronger together when we stand together, when we fight together, when we invest in each other and sac-rifice for each other. I am one who believes the defense of this Nation isn’t just a powerful mili-tary abroad and at home. The defense of our Nation also means that for a vulnerable child, who has a terrible dis-ease that we can cure—we, our Nation, should take care of our own. The defense of our country means that our elder citizens, two-thirds of whom are in nursing homes and rely on the Medicaid Program—the defense of our Nation, the preservation of our ideals is evidenced in the care of the el-derly, the dignity that we acknowledge and afford them. That is the very defi-nition of who we are as Americans. I am one of those people who believes that the ideals of this Nation are evi-dent not just in the strength of our military but also in the strength of our system of healthcare. It is a violation of our principles and values as a nation when our healthcare system breaks down—not to the ideals we see in our military where we protect all of our country; we stand for everyone, rich or poor. But, suddenly, with our healthcare system, with accessing life-saving medicines and procedures, crit-ical preventive care, it suddenly boils down to those who are very wealthy getting access, and people who are struggling in minimum-wage jobs, fighting every day to raise their kids— somehow that should not be covered in our ideals. We are a nation that professes the most profound values—the oldest con-stitutional democracy, which put forth ideals that we are not a theocracy, a nation based upon privilege, based upon how you pray. We are not a mon-archy. We are the oldest constitutional democracy that put ideals forward that became lights to other nations. This ideal that we believe in liberty and justice for all—what justice is there in a piece of legislation that would cast millions of Americans, our poorest Americans, our sickest Ameri-cans, our elderly Americans into a world where they no longer have the security of healthcare? Is that justice in this country? What is the concept of liberty in our Nation if some people are shackled to fear and worry that if their child gets sick, they will not have access to care? What is freedom if people are impris-oned by an illness or disease that they cannot get adequately treated because they do not have health coverage? Es-sential to the ideals of our country— the ideals of life and liberty and happi-ness—is having a system of healthcare that provides a stable foundation for life. When half of the children born in this country are beneficiaries of a Medicaid Program, why would we slash that pro-gram if doing so undermines the very start of the lives of our children? That is against our values as a country. We are a nation in which every generation has expanded access, has expanded op-portunity. Over 50 years ago, when Medicare and Medicaid Programs were formed, ex-panding access to healthcare for the el-derly, expanding access to healthcare for the sick, expanding access to healthcare for hard-working, low-in-come people, that was an advancement forward. When this body passed the Af-fordable Care Act—and 20 million more Americans gained access to healthcare, to lifesaving procedures, to the sta-bility that comes from having that se-curity—we advanced this Nation more toward its ideals. This body should be coming together to take the imperfections of the Af-fordable Care Act, to find where it has fallen short, and work together to build upon that foundation so everyone in this Nation can have justice and op-portunity; that everyone, when it comes to the grip of illness or disease, can find the freedom that comes with the security and the ease of mind in knowing they can afford to go to a doc-tor. That is a national aspiration. That is national defense. That is who we are and what we stand for. So now here we are again. The most frustrating moments of my time as a U.S. Senator were to have seen legisla-tion not in any way coming through the processes set up by our forefathers and foremothers in this place. How can we usurp the traditions of the Senate and rush to the floor to vote on legisla-tion that hasn’t benefited from the wis-dom and the genius and the experience of medical professionals or experts? It was just pushed to the floor. Even non-partisan experts say it would rip healthcare from millions and would raise costs for the elderly. How can we as a body do this to ourselves? We are in this situation again, where legislation is being proposed, where votes are being counted, where people are discussing if can we bring a bill to the floor, another version of those that have fallen and been defeated. Can we bring this version forward? I say it is time we stop. It is time we understand that in the same way we hammered out a bill today and passed legislation—bil-lions of dollars to protect our country from threats of wrongdoing—that we make the same kind of effort to work together, to talk, to hold hearings, to listen to each other, to try to make sure we are defending each other, sup-porting each other, and helping each other so that we are a generation, like our forefathers and foremothers, ex-panding concepts of liberty and free-dom and access for more people. Instead, here we are, with millions of Americans now turning their attention back to the U.S. Senate—Americans with disabilities; parents with children like Ethan who worry that should they need another operation, if the rules change, if legislation changes, they will not have that access; young people with parents in nursing homes, won-dering will Medicaid expansion survive yet another attempt to gut the pro-gram. At a time when we need to be en-couraging each other and strength-ening our commitments to one an-other, we face a time of jeopardy, a de-cision point, a crossroads—not just in the pragmatic realities of healthcare that will come forward but a cross-roads of our values and a crossroads of our ideals. Will we go forward as a na-tion together, expanding opportunities, securing justice, defending each other, empowering each other, or will we go back? I end with saying this. What I have learned is, the decisions made here are not always easy, and they are often de-pendent upon the engagement of the Nation as a whole. I stand here, the beneficiary of courageous Americans, who stood and fought for all of our val-ues and all of our ideals, fought to ex-pand access and equality and oppor-tunity, fought to defend this Nation at home and abroad, and to insist that every child have certain basic rights and opportunities. This is yet another moral moment for our Nation. I believe every child should have access to affordable, qual-ity healthcare. I believe every senior citizen growing old should have the se-curity and the dignity of healthy envi-ronments. I believe people should not be denied the justice of healthcare be-cause they have a preexisting condi-tion. I don’t think these are radical beliefs in any way. I don’t think it was radical to stand up in the late 1800s and say women should have the right to vote, that it was radical to think children should not have to experience child labor. It wasn’t radical to say that Black Americans should have equal ac-cess to restaurants and hotels. These are not radical ideas. The reason this body stood up, generation after genera-tion, securing privileges and expanding opportunities and opening access—the reason this body did that was not just because of the decisions of the people on this floor, it was because Americans stood up and demanded these changes, demanded this progress, and fought for every inch of ground. That is the moment we are in right now, a call to the conscience of our country. This is not a time to be silent. This is not a time to be indifferent. This is not a time for apathy. This is a time for all of us to make a decision about who we will be as a nation. Will we be a nation that provides affordable, quality healthcare to all or will we slide back into that basic right being only available to a smaller and smaller group of people? That is the decision,

and the decision will be made, not just by the votes on this floor or the deci-sions made by the 100 in this body, it must be made collectively, through our engagement and through our activism and what we demand from our rep-resentatives. Here we are in this moral moment with this decision before our country. My prayer and my hope is that all of us, with a collective voice, with a cho-rus that resonates with that of our an-cestors—that we fight for the defense of our Nation, that we stand up and take responsibility for ideals of equal justice, ideals of liberty and freedom, ideals of life and liberty and the pur-suit of happiness, ideals that have made this Nation shine and have shown our greatness and our character. That doesn’t happen by accident or some in-evitability of history. It happens be-cause we fight for it and work for it. If there is any moment in American history where we need that spirit, that American grit, that toughness and that fight, it is this moment right now. Mr. President, thank you. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. G
ARDNER ). The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise to-night to talk about yet another healthcare debate we are having here in the Senate. As many people know and have been following this over the last number of months, we had a long debate and then a vote here at the end of July. At that point, despite all of the conflict and all of the debate and arguing about healthcare for not just months but for years, we moved to a new chapter, and that new chapter for a number of weeks has been very posi-tive. When I went home to Pennsylvania, I went to 32 counties in the month of Au-gust, and in a lot of those counties, I tried to give a bit of good news on healthcare despite all of the conflict about it. I was able to say that since July 28, when the vote was held, we have had very positive bipartisan dis-cussions. I was part of several of them. The chairman of the Health, Edu-cation, Labor, and Pensions Com-mittee—the so-called HELP Com-mittee—Senator L
AMAR ALEXANDER  from Tennessee, announced, in agree-ment with Senator P
ATTY MURRAY of Washington, that they were going to preside over bipartisan healthcare hearings in that committee—probably the first bipartisan hearings in a long time. What that meant was that we were going to finally have hearings and a thorough examination of a few issues, not a sweeping bill that would repeal the Affordable Care Act and decimate Medicaid the way the prior bills would have but take elements or pieces of some of the challenges we have before us and try to fix those problems. That took place over the last 2 weeks and was among the most positive healthcare moments we have had in the Senate in a long, long time. What did we do? Well, we were fo-cused on making sure that the cost- sharing payments were made—hoping we can get a bipartisan bill on that in the next couple of days—and focused on problems in the individual market, real problems, serious attention to serious issues—not a game, not a political ex-ercise, not an ideological exercise; Democrats and Republicans sitting down and working together in the HELP Committee to solve some of—not all of but some of the problems in our healthcare system. It has been a very positive development for the com-mittee, for the Senate, and for the Na-tion. There is a little more good news. Both parties have come together to make sure that the Children’s Health Insurance Program continues. It is one of the most important programs in Pennsylvania. These are approximate numbers, but about 175,000 children in Pennsylvania get their healthcare that way. So both parties came together on that as well. It is very bipartisan. Since its enactment way back in the midnineties, CHIP has been bipartisan. There have been a couple of rocky roads here and there, but it has been mostly bipartisan for 20 years, and it will be again at this time in the Sen-ate. It is very personal to me. My father was the Governor of Pennsylvania in 1992 when CHIP passed. I think we might have been the largest State with a children’s health insurance program, and those kinds of State models be-came the basis for Federal legislation. It is deeply personal to families across Pennsylvania who, absent the CHIP program, would not have healthcare. The same is true of Med-icaid, which, of course, is a much big-ger number. A lot of children in the country have healthcare solely because of Medicaid, and some adults have healthcare solely because of Medicaid— millions of them. I think when we have these debates, we should remind ourselves about the value, the importance, the significance of these programs and the consequence of undermining them or wiping them out. In the case of Medicaid, what some earlier versions of the Republican healthcare bills would do would be to decimate Medicaid over time. Maybe not in year 1 or year 2, but over time they would have a terribly devastating impact on Medicaid. What is Medicaid? It happens to be the program through which 40 percent of all children get their healthcare and 60 percent of all children with disabil-ities get their healthcare. About two- thirds of nursing home care is paid for by Medicaid. Ask a family member who has a loved one with a disability what Medicaid means to that family. Med-icaid is life or death. I know we have debates around here where people talk about Medicaid as if it is just another program, just another budget matter, just another healthcare talking point. Well, one of the reasons these bills have not passed is because a lot of Americans—Democrats and Re-publicans and Independents out there far away from Washington—realize what would have happened if we passed some of these bills, what would have happened to the Medicare Program that covers more than 70 million Amer-icans. No one here would lose their healthcare, by the way. No Senator, no House Member, or their families would lose their healthcare. But folks here were perfectly willing to support legis-lation that would result in millions— not a few million; double-figure mil-lions—15 million, maybe, would have lost their healthcare and Medicaid if these bills had passed and several mil-lion more in the exchanges or other-wise. That is what we were debating, but, as I said, since July 28, we have had a lot of bipartisan moments and that is a good thing. Where are we right now? Well, here is where we are: with a piece a legisla-tion—the shorthand is Cassidy-Gra-ham, the two Senators who are leading the bill. What would it do? Well, it would do a couple of things that we should never allow to pass, in my judg-ment. It establishes a per capita cap on Medicaid. That is a bad idea. We should reject that. It ends Medicaid expansion as we know it, the part of Medicaid that now covers 11 million people. In the context of how difficult it is for States and counties and commu-nities across the country to deal with the opioid crisis, I hope they don’t say: We are going to pass a bill that will end Medicaid expansion as we know it, because we know that the biggest payer—the program that has the most impact on treating people who are in the grip of the opioid epidemic, who are gripped by that addiction—Medicaid expansion provides more help than any other program. At last count, 68,000 Pennsylvanians with an opioid issue got their help from Medicaid expan-sion. Solely because of Medicaid expan-sion, they can get help for opioids. So ending the Medicaid expansion as we know it is another bad idea. It rolls back protections for Ameri-cans with preexisting conditions. I thought we settled this, that this would be a guarantee going forward, that no matter what bill—Democratic, Republican, or otherwise—we would make sure that was a national stand-ard, that no one had to worry about preexisting conditions again. Well, here we are again concerned about what might happen as a result of this legislation and what a State might do to take away the protections on pre-existing conditions because they waive it, and they are allowed to waive it under these bills. It allows States to impose burden-some work requirements as a condition

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES5818 September 18, 2017 
of coverage. That is another result of the bill. It takes coverage away from millions of Americans. We mentioned that, but it bears repeating. This isn’t just a policy debate; this is about folks whom we all represent. I represent families in Pennsylvania, many of whom wrote to me, have con-tacted me telling me their stories. One of them was Pam Simpson. Pam is from southeastern Pennsyl-vania, Coatesville. Her son Rowan was diagnosed on the autism spectrum a number of years ago. Prior to having the protection of Medicaid—what we call in Pennsylvania Medical Assist-ance—that family had a big challenge. Challenges continue even after the cov-erage. What Pam said to me in a letter was how much benefit there was to her family in terms of getting the treat-ment and the help from Medicaid. She said: 
Without Medicaid, I am confident I could not work full-time to support our family. We would be bankrupt or my son— 
Meaning Rowan— 
would go without the therapies he sincerely needs. 
So here is a child who was 5 years old when he was diagnosed, and here is a mother telling me that their lives are a lot better because they have the pro-tection of Medicaid because their son has a disability. And there are a lot of families in which a child might have more than one disability. And even some families who have wealth or very good healthcare coverage still need Medicaid if they have a child with a profound disability. So this isn’t just about one group of Americans; this cuts across all incomes, all regions, all parties, all beliefs. That is what Med-icaid does, because do you know what Medicaid is? It is an American pro-gram. We are the greatest country in the world. We have the strongest economy in the world. We have the strongest military in the world. And we can do all that and still have a program that says to any family who has a loved one with a disability: We are going to help you. We don’t care where you live—we are going to try to help you because your family member has a disability. If you are low income, we are going to make sure your child has healthcare and gets all the excellent screening and diagnoses that take place early in a child’s life to prevent disease, to pre-vent all kinds of challenges in the life of that child, because we are a great country. We are called America, and that is what America does—we take care of people who need help. And if it costs some more, we find the money to do it, just as we find the money to protect our security when we have a conflict. We all come together as a country, and we protect the country. Well, it is about time that Wash-ington came together to protect people who have the benefit of a great pro-gram called Medicaid or other healthcare programs because that is what a great country does. If we do to Medicaid what some here have wanted to do, we will be dimin-ished as a country. We will all be di-minished. Do we want to live in a coun-try where we just had 20 million people gain healthcare coverage and go back-ward, have more people without health insurance, have more children lose their Medicaid coverage? Is that the country we want to be? I don’t think so. I don’t think any Republican be-lieves that, and I don’t think any Dem-ocrat believes that—if you call yourself an American, because that is what America does. We take on big chal-lenges and we solve problems. Medicaid is not the problem here. We have problems in our healthcare sys-tem; Medicaid is not one of them. Med-icaid is helping a lot of people, and we are going to protect it. This idea that we have come together in the HELP Committee on fixing the parts of the system that we have to fix and doing a thorough examination and having hearings—isn’t that a radical idea? I just heard in the last couple of hours that there is a healthcare hear-ing on Monday. Oh my goodness. Isn’t that wonderful? So there will be a hearing on Monday, and I guess they want to pass the bill on Thursday. That is what counts for thorough examina-tion or regular order on one of the most complicated challenges we have? Why don’t they agree to do it the way L
AMAR ALEXANDER did, as the chair of the HELP Committee? He said we are going to take these discrete, individual challenges and examine them closely, come together on a bill, and then pass the bill, and then we are going to move to the next problem and the next chal-lenge and solve them one at a time or two at a time, not take a meat ax to Medicaid and hope it works out for peo-ple who don’t have any healthcare cov-erage. That is what a great Senate would do. We would have months of hearings on this bill that some people want to pass by the end of September. But I will go back to the positive plane that we have been on. There has been good work on the HELP Com-mittee on some issues, good work on the Finance Committee on the Chil-dren’s Health Insurance Program get-ting reauthorized. While all of that col-laboration is going on, all of those good discussions, all of that back-and-forth about policy, no yelling, no screaming, no finger-pointing, all the while, just in the last couple of days, this bill is moving through Washington quietly, but it is moving and it is starting to pick up momentum, like a snake in the grass. That is what this bill is—it is like a snake in the grass. You may not see it yet, you may not know much about it, but it is coming. And if they pass it next week, you may not feel the impact in 2017, you may not feel the bite of that serpent in 2018, you may not feel it in 2019, but you are going to feel it. And if we allow that snake in the grass to inject its venom into peo-ple—my analogy for losing your healthcare coverage—then we are not the Senate we should be. We are not the government we should be. We should be an institution—the U.S. Senate—that protects people from those kinds of adverse consequences. And this bill is that kind of a threat to people. It will bite, and that bite will have a lot of venom. Why do I say that? Well, think of what would happen to the Medicaid Program. By one estimate, starting in 2027, funding would be cut off com-pletely, leaving 32 million Americans without access to health insurance of any kind and leaving States with zero Federal dollars to replace Medicaid ex-pansion, marketplace tax credits, and cost-sharing reductions. So please don’t make the argument that Med-icaid is going to be just fine when you are block-granting it, which is a rather benign description of giving a block of money to a State and hoping that it works out, hoping that it is enough money or enough funding to pay for that State’s Medicaid needs. What if you have more children with disabilities? What if that number grows? This bill basically says to the State: Good luck, State. The State has to balance its budget, by the way. The Federal Government doesn’t have to do that. The State has to balance its budget, and they, by definition, will have to cap services and treatment to people with disabilities. So that is what this is all about in the end. It is about sending the problem back to the States and calling it flexibility. Isn’t that a nice word? All these benign words—flexibility, block granting, per capita caps—all sound so benign. There is a lot of venom in those policies. What does it mean for one State? I will just give you one example. In Pennsylvania, we had more than 700,000 people obtain health insurance through Medicaid expansion—over 700,000 peo-ple. In the marketplace or the ex-change, there are another over 400,000 people. So more than 1.1 million people got healthcare in one State through Medicaid expansion or through the marketplace. How about rural Pennsylvania? We have 67 counties. How about the 48 rural counties in my State? How many people living in rural Pennsylvania got healthcare? At last count, it was over 278,000 people—almost 280,000 people— and 180,000 obtained health insurance through the Medicaid expansion. The balance was through the exchanges. What are we going to say to rural Pennsylvania? I know 180,000 of your neighbors, friends, and family members got health insurance through Medicaid expansion, but we are going to wind that down, and you will be just fine. Don’t worry; Washington will guar-antee that you are just fine. That is a big lie, if you try to make that argu-ment to rural Pennsylvania and to other parts of our State as well. What do we say to rural hospitals that have very thin margins already?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5819 September 18, 2017 
Some of them are on the brink of hav-ing a major problem and depend upon the support they get from Medicaid. In rural Pennsylvania we have a lot of folks who have illnesses and challenges that maybe some of the rest of us don’t have. They tend to be older folks who have those challenges, too. What do we say to them? Are we saying to them that we are just going to wind down the support that Medicaid provides in a State like Pennsylvania? So my plea to my colleagues is this. Don’t allow this snake in the grass to get close to anyone and to bite them and to inject venom in them. Don’t allow that to happen. Don’t allow this bill to rip away healthcare from mil-lions of people, just like the bill before that and the bill before that. Work with people in both parties to do what we are doing in the HELP Committee and, to a certain extent, although very limited, in the Finance Committee. I think we have a good model to work together, but I can’t go back to Pam Simpson and say: Pam, you know what; I know that you are happy with the Medicaid that Rowan is receiving, and I know it is working out for you, but there are some people in Washington who just had a different idea for you. So you are on your own. You and your family are on your own. I don’t think that is what we do as Americans. Forget being Senators; I don’t think that is an American thing to do. We help people that need help. All of us in our lives need help at some point or another. No one is immune to some of these challenges. I will just read one or two sentences from the end of the letter that Pam Simpson wrote me months ago, in the earlier part of this year, when she talked about how important Medicaid was to her. She is pleading with me at the end of this letter to protect her son and to protect her family. I would just ask that my colleagues consider this when they are considering how to vote. Pam talked about all the benefits that Medicaid provides her son because of his disability and her family. She said: Please think of Rowan, my son. Please think of my husband and me, she said. But here is how she concludes: 
Please think of my 9-month-old daughter Luna— 
That is Rowan’s younger sister— 
who smiles and laughs at her brother daily. She will have to care for Rowan later in her life after we are gone. Overall, we are des-perately in need of Rowan’s Medicaid assist-ance and would be devastated if we lost these benefits. 
I hope we can all say to Pam Simp-son and her family and to any family who benefits from Medicaid or Med-icaid expansion or the protections of the Affordable Care Act that we are guaranteeing that you are going to have those protections. We are going to guarantee that those protections are going to be there for you. Hopefully, every Member of the Sen-ate can say that and vote in accord-ance with that promise. I would use an old expression and ask Members of the Senate to examine their conscience. Is this what you want people to remem-ber you for—this kind of vote, where Rowan’s mother has to worry, Rowan has to lose his Medicaid coverage, a poor child in a big city has to lose their healthcare coverage, or a child in a rural area or someone working at a rural hospital loses their job because of these massive ideologically driven cuts to Medicaid? I hope you can answer the call of your own conscience when you vote that way. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. CAPITO ). The Senator from Hawaii. Mr. SCHATZ. Madam President, for the past several months, Republicans in Washington have done just about ev-erything they can to hide their healthcare repeal bill. Remember that way back in the beginning they tried to actually move a bill without a CBO score. Then, they realized that even Republicans didn’t want to vote on something without knowing how much it would cost or how many people would lose healthcare coverage. So they said the score didn’t matter or that it was wrong, except for in the areas where they liked the numbers. They trashed the CBO even though, for the last 8 years, they referred to the CBO to make their argument against the Affordable Care Act. When that didn’t work, they tapped 13 men to draft a bill in secret. It is no surprise that a bill crafted without women, without hearings, and without Democrats was not able to cross the finish line. Now they are actually back to their original plan, which is to push legisla-tion without a score from the CBO. In other words, we are going to go to next week, and we are going to vote without knowing how bad this bill is. This is not the way the Senate is supposed to work. If there is no score, there should be no vote. Clearly, CBO got back to the Senate today and said that they will have enough time to analyze the fiscal im-pact of this proposal, but they will not be able to analyze the impact it has on our constituents. So do you remember the last 2 or 3 iterations of this bill? People were con-cerned with the fiscal impact. But re-member that the headlines were that 18 million people lose coverage, 26 million people lose coverage, and 32 million people lose coverage. We are going to vote next week not knowing how many people are going to lose coverage. It shouldn’t matter what side of the aisle you sit on. We should all be able to agree that something as complicated as healthcare needs as much debate as we could possibly get, and that is certainly more than the 90 seconds that procedurally we have left on this bill. After all, this is one-sixth of the American economy, but for the third time this year, Republicans are going to do whatever it takes to pass a healthcare bill, even if no one knows what is in it or what it will do, even if this bill is very clearly bad policy. By doing this, they are letting down mil-lions of Americans who were counting on the Senate to be the cooling saucer and to slow down and consider policy carefully. There has been very little debate around this bill. We have not heard from doctors. We have not heard from patients or advocacy groups. We have not heard from healthcare administra-tors or economists. That is because we have had no hearings. Just tonight, Senate Finance Chair-man H ATCH announced that on Monday at 10 a.m. his committee will hold a hearing on the bill, and I am hopeful that, through that process, we will begin to understand the damage that this bill will do. But right now, here is what we know. This is actually the most extreme of all of the versions of TrumpCare that we have seen. Here is what it does. It eliminates everything in the ACA that was essential: tax credits and subsidies to help people to afford their insurance; the Medicaid ex-pansion, which is very, very successful and very popular; and the protocols that we have in place for people with preexisting conditions. It eliminates Medicaid as we know it. This bill eliminates Medicaid as we know it. So what they did was that they established block grants, which means you get a fixed amount. Each State gets a fixed amount for Medicaid. Then, those Medicaid block grants dis-appear after 10 years. It is shocking to me that having failed to get the votes, they went fur-ther to the right, with deeper cuts to Medicaid—both to the Medicaid expan-sion program and to the Medicaid Pro-gram as it existed before the Afford-able Care Act. They went ahead and said: You know, we only got to 49 votes last time. So I think what we should do is to eliminate all of the subsidies, all of the patient protections, all of the es-sential health benefits, and all of the Medicaid expansion, and let’s take Medicaid as it exists and eviscerate it. The latest version of TrumpCare will take healthcare coverage away from tens of millions of people. Last week our country hit an impor-tant milestone. The number of Ameri-cans who do not have health insurance fell to a historic low of 8.8 percent. That means that 9 out of 10 Americans now have health insurance. But instead of celebrating this milestone, Repub-licans are about to end our country’s progress on healthcare. Americans who don’t lose their cov-erage will still get hurt with higher premiums or insurance plans that don’t cover basic things like getting help for opioid addiction, pregnancy, hospital stays, mental health. So if this bill passes, healthcare will no longer be a right in this country. It will be a privi-lege. It depends on where you live,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES5820 September 18, 2017 
where you work, and how much money you make. This bill devastates one of the best and most successful programs this country has, and that is Medicaid. This is a program that helps one out of every five Americans and two out of every five children. It helps one out of every two families with a newborn baby, and it covers three out of every four long-term nursing home residents. Medicaid saves lives—nursing home pa-tients, people struggling with opioid addiction, and people who are working two jobs but still don’t have enough to cover their own healthcare. This bill destroys Medicaid as we know it. They start off by putting tra-ditional Medicaid into what they call per capita caps or block grants. That basically means that, whatever money was spent last year, that is the amount the State gets in perpetuity until they just zero it out completely. What that means is that States will be left with-out adequate Federal funding for Med-icaid. Think about what this means for the healthcare infrastructure in this country. In many States hospitals and local governments have actually designed the healthcare system based on a cer-tain amount of Federal funding coming in. If you take away that funding, hos-pitals will collapse. In rural areas, hos-pitals and clinics will close, and people will be left without options and ulti-mately without access. That is just the damage done by cutting Medicaid. This bill also lets insurance compa-nies opt out of covering what they call ‘‘essential health benefits.’’ This is a term of art, a piece of jargon. So I want to explain what this means. Under cur-rent law, there are certain things that have to be in any healthcare plan. Those are called essential health bene-fits. You buy a healthcare plan, wher-ever you buy it. If you get an em-ployer-covered plan, if it is a DOD plan or a VA plan, or if you are on the ex-change—whatever it is—it has to cover certain things. Let me list what is cov-ered right now as an essential health benefit: ambulatory patient services, emergency services, hospitalization, maternity and newborn care, mental health and substance abuse services, prescription drugs, rehab, lab services, preventive and wellness services, chronic disease management, and pedi-atric services. These are the things that actually have to be in your healthcare plan under ACA. Yet do you know what this bill does? It says: No need. Configure your healthcare plan however you see fit. If you are a health insurance com-pany and if you are a for-profit health insurance company, you are going to pick and choose these things based on what is profitable, and if there is a cer-tain thing that is costing you a lot of money, you are under no obligation to provide any of these health benefits be-cause it is not in the law anymore. This eviscerates essential health bene-fits. This bill will also take away protec-tions for people with preexisting condi-tions. Nothing will hold States back from allowing insurers to charge people with diabetes more or people with can-cer more for their health insurance. Experts have started to look at what this will mean for people with pre-existing conditions, and they will pay thousands of dollars more. A patient with asthma will pay more than $4,000 a year extra if this bill passes, while a patient with metastatic cancer will pay $142,000 extra. If you have meta-static cancer, this bill will cost you $142,000. If you have a kid with asthma, that will be $4,000 a year. This is their healthcare bill—to charge people more who get sick. That is their healthcare bill. Everything that is working under our healthcare system is being shredded by this bill. Take Planned Parenthood. These health centers serve millions of women and men across the country. They are part of the solution, not the problem, but this bill cuts funding to Planned Parenthood, which will cause many of these clinics to close. I want you to think about how many people in this country are actually em-ployed in the healthcare industry. When the Affordable Care Act started to kick in, research estimated that as many as half a million jobs were cre-ated. But if millions of people are to lose their insurance, that means that they will lose access. If fewer people can access healthcare, that means that we will have fewer doctors, nurses, and technicians. In other words, cuts to healthcare coverage are also cuts to American jobs. I know that, in a lot of rural commu-nities across Hawaii and across West Virginia and across the country, the community healthcare centers or the small rural hospitals are not just the centers of their communities in a so-cial context or in a community con-text, but a lot of the time they are the economic drivers. So this will do great damage to rural America. I end by making clear what this means for Americans and their healthcare. This is bad policy, plain and simple. It is bad if you live in a State like Ohio, where lives have lit-erally been changed because people now have access to prescription drugs or to a primary care provider under Medicaid. It is bad for people who buy their insurance on the exchanges be-cause their prices are going to go up. It is really bad for people with dis-abilities. This is not unusual. For whatever reason, people with disabil-ities are the first to be punished when the battle over healthcare comes up. It is bad for people with preexisting conditions because States will no longer be required to protect their abil-ity to get healthcare. This bill does not pass Senator C
ASSIDY ’s own Jimmy Kimmel test. That is why more than half a million doctors in the United States have come out as being opposed to this bill, because it will take healthcare away from the people who need it, who are sick, and who will not be able to get healthcare if the bill goes into law. This may feel like the zombie bill we have killed several times already. I know it feels like that for me. I am sure that people are exhausted. I am sure that people thought this was over. We had that magnificent moment on the Senate floor when JOHN MCCAIN walked over to that well right there and did a thumbs down. I tell every-body back home that it is so rare that politics is just like the movies, but that night was just like the movies. J
OHNMCCAINsaved healthcare for the American people and put us on a path toward regular order. What does ‘‘reg-ular order’’ mean? I did not know what that phrase meant until I came to this institution. Regular order just means that the Senate understands that it has a special obligation in American soci-ety—that we are the place in which we are supposed to handle tough issues. Chairman M
CCAINpricked our con-sciences as Senators. Forget Demo-crats and Republicans; forget Liberals and Conservatives. We are all here be-cause we want to try to make a dif-ference. So there we were with L
AMAR  A
LEXANDER , the chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-sions Committee, and P
ATTY MURRAY , the top Democrat on that committee. They were ready to work on a bipar-tisan basis. L
AMAR had held hearings and, by all accounts, they had had tough negotiations and difficult chal-lenges, not as much progress as you would want or as quickly as you would want. That is the way legislating works. They are in a bipartisan proc-ess, and we show up here, and that process is in danger of being blown up. This bill is a rotten piece of legisla-tion. It is not like this thing has been vetted by experts. It is not like this thing is bipartisan. It is not like this thing will help. It would be one thing if this were absolutely necessary. Then, you could make some procedural ac-commodations because you just must. This is a political necessity for a party that has not yet had a legislative win. That is why they are doing this. They are in a hurry because they have until September 30 to check a box called ‘‘We repealed and replaced the Afford-able Care Act.’’ They have no new ideas. So what they did was to take all of the bad ideas from all of their pre-vious bills and put them into one bill, and they are going to take one last swing at it. I cannot tell you how disappointed I am, not just on policy but on process. I was never prouder to be in the Senate than on that early morning, after a long session, when J
OHN came in and, in my view, saved the Senate and put us on a path toward regular order. Do not blow that up. We have a chance to do things in a bipartisan way and re-store the dignity of this institution, but what we are fixing to do next week will take us in a very, very dark direc-tion.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5821 September 18, 2017 
I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Connecticut. Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, be-fore the Senator leaves the floor, I just want to probe him for a moment on this question of process. Listen, this is an affront to the Sen-ate—a bill that reorders one-fifth of the U.S. economy and that is being de-livered to us days or weeks before we are to vote on it. The Senator may have covered this, and if he did, he may just reiterate it for me. My understanding is that there is not going to be a CBO score before this bill is before us. For the folks who do not know what that means, that means that everyone who votes on this bill will have no clue as to how many peo-ple will lose insurance, how high pre-miums will go, or how much money their States will lose. I do not think that we have ever, ever voted on a bill of this scope and size without having an analysis from the CBO. My under-standing is that, today, when you list or rank the affronts on the process in-volved in the debate over Graham-Cas-sidy, at the top of that list will be the fact that we are not going to see a CBO score. Mr. SCHATZ. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Connecticut. That is right. I would just point out that they are going to get the fiscal impact from the CBO in order to com-ply with the terms of reconciliation, but that is, actually, not what impacts the American people the most. When you get a CBO score—and it is exactly right, what the Senator from Connecticut said—you find out what impact it has on your home State. You find out the number of Americans who are going to be harmed by this bill or helped by this bill. What we do know is that, basically, this contains elements of all of the previous pieces of legisla-tion. It, actually, just kind of combines them all and puts them in a pile. So it is very hard for me to imagine, when they do come back with their analysis, that it will not be 20, 30, 35 million peo-ple who will lose healthcare. The craziest thing about this is that these Republicans who will vote yes are going to vote yes and then find out 10 days later that 25 million people are going to lose their healthcare. Why they will not wait is beyond me, except that they have a deadline to deliver a win for the President. As near as I can tell, that is the only reason that they are in such a rush. Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, if I may ask the Senator a follow-up ques-tion, we are in a different position today because, when we were taking these votes a month ago, there was only the faint talk of a bipartisan proc-ess to try to keep what works in the Affordable Care Act and fix what is not working. It is another assault on the process, in my mind, and I ask for the Senator’s thoughts on it. Literally, as we speak, Republicans and Democrats are talking to each other about the bipartisan bill that Americans in every State are beg-ging for. Apparently, if this bill is going to be brought before the Senate, then that whole process was a fraud. It was a ruse to distract Democrats into thinking that there might be a bipar-tisan fix. It was pulling one over on the American public to give the impression that, maybe, Republicans were inter-ested in a bipartisan compromise. Right now, there is a process playing out, and if this bill comes up for debate with no CBO score, then, that bipar-tisan process, which was really hopeful for a lot of Americans, I assume just falls apart; right? Mr. SCHATZ. Madam President, I think the Senator is right. I agree with him. I think that one of the most encour-aging things over the last 5 weeks has been L
AMAR ALEXANDER and P ATTY  M
URRAY and their ability to work to-gether. I mean, if you had told, I think, either of us that we were going to re-peal and replace No Child Left Behind with 77 votes in the Senate, I would have said: I don’t know. That seems like it is going to get into some pretty difficult, partisan, thorny territory. Yet what L
AMAR and P ATTY were able to do is to conduct hearings and bring us through a process by which we acted like a Senate, and we got all the votes. Now we are in that process when it comes to healthcare, and I think some people feel deeply uncomfortable with empowering the chair men and women of this body. They feel deeply uncom-fortable. They talk about the regular order, but they really just want to get their way on the floor. I will just make one other point here. As people on the Republican side were justifying their ‘‘yes’’ votes in BCRA and whatever the other one was called before that, they were always talking about advancing the conversation and bringing us into a conference com-mittee negotiation. Now, because Sep-tember 30 is the deadline, there will be no negotiation. If Graham-Cassidy passes the Senate, it will pass the House, and it will be enacted into law. Nobody will get to hide behind: Well, this is not perfect, but I want to ad-vance the conversation, and maybe we can fix this in the House or fix this in the conference committee. This is the bill. The bill that gets voted on next week is the bill. Every-body owns it, and you own the fact that you don’t even know what it is going to do to your own constituents. Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, I thank the Senator. I know it is late, and I thank him for staying on the floor for a few moments. You do not know what it is going to do to your own constituents. We do not have a CBO score telling us how many people will lose coverage, how high rates will go, what will happen to Med-icaid. It is also another bill that has been written behind closed doors. Sen-ator C
ASSIDY and Senator G RAHAM may have spent some time in thinking about what this legislation does, but virtually no one else has been let into the room. Patients have not been in that room. Doctors have not been in that room. Hospitals have not been in that room. Do you know why I am pretty confident of that? It is because all of the groups that represent those populations oppose this legislation. Potentially, we are going to vote next week on a healthcare bill that massively, massively reorders the American healthcare system and that is opposed by the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Physicians, the American College of Obstetricians and Gyne-cologists, the American Osteopathic Association, and the American Psy-chiatric Association. Those are the physician groups. By the way, it is kind of hard to know for these groups whether they are for it or against it, as there is no CBO analysis of this, but the patient groups have weighed in. Basically, every group that represents patients who are sick in this country is begging this Con-gress not to pass this bill. Also included is the ALS Association, the Cancer Society, the American Dia-betes Association, the Heart Associa-tion, the Lung Association, the Arthri-tis Foundation, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, the Juvenile Diagnosis Re-search Fund, the Lutheran Services of America, the March of Dimes, the Na-tional Health Council, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the Na-tional Organization of Rare Diseases. How do you pass a bill that has no CBO score, that has had no hearings, that is opposed by every single group that Republicans welcome into their office every year representing people with serious diseases? There have been some really mean healthcare proposals, but Graham-Cas-sidy is the meanest version of TrumpCare yet. Let me walk you through why I say that. Again, we don’t have the numbers so we don’t have a CBO analysis of how many million people are going to lose access to healthcare, but let me guar-antee you it will be in the millions, likely in the tens of millions. The bill radically—radically—trims the amount of money States will get in order to insure the population that has been insured by the Affordable Care Act. What this bill does is shrink the amount of money we are spending, then redistributes it out to States, and it will simply not be enough—not near-ly enough money—in order to cover the 20 million people who have insurance today because of the Affordable Care Act; many of those through Medicaid, others through the healthcare ex-changes. An early analysis by an outside group that is trying to help us understand what this means suggests that for my little State of Connecticut, it will be a $4 billion reduction in healthcare dol-lars from the Federal Government to

the State of Connecticut. We are a State that doesn’t have a $20 billion annual budget. Four billion dollars means that we will either have to kick hundreds of thousands of people off of healthcare or we will have to dramati-cally raise people’s taxes. So all of the reductions in insurance are in this bill. We will just have mil-lions of people losing access to health insurance under this bill. The specific, targeted harm to women is in this bill. Planned Parent-hood is one of the country’s biggest providers of primary care and preven-tive healthcare services to women. I get that many Republicans have a problem with Planned Parenthood be-cause they also provide abortion serv-ices, but the majority of their work is, in fact, providing basic preventive healthcare to women in this country. My wife, when she was a low-income twenty-something, could only afford to get her healthcare through Planned Parenthood. That is where she went for her preventive healthcare, for her wellness checkups, and there are mil-lions of women just like her. This bill is particularly cruel and particularly mean to all of the women in this coun-try who, without access to a Planned Parenthood clinic, may not be able to get quality, affordable, preventive healthcare. This bill is perhaps the meanest, though, to individuals who are sick or individuals who have been sick because at least in prior versions of TrumpCare that came before this body, there was at least a meager attempt to try to preserve protections for people with preexisting conditions. It wasn’t work-able, but at least there was a face-sav-ing gesture by Republicans and by the Trump administration to try to at least claim there was language to pro-tect people with preexisting conditions. Senator C
RUZ stood on this floor a few years ago during his long overnight filibuster. I sat in the chair listening to him explain how everyone knows, in-cluding him, that you cannot protect people with preexisting conditions without requiring, in some way, shape, or form, that healthy people buy cov-erage. Why is that? Let me walk you through it for a minute because it is not hard to understand, but it is really important to understand because peo-ple don’t like the individual mandate. They are not going to understand that. Nobody likes to be required to do some-thing, but you cannot protect people with preexisting conditions if you don’t require people to buy insurance. The logic goes like this. If you say to insurance companies that you cannot charge people who are sick more than people who are not sick, if you say to an insurance company that you cannot charge someone with cancer more than someone who is healthy and you don’t require that healthy people buy insur-ance, then what does the rational indi-vidual do? The rational individual, in that case, says: Why would I buy health insurance while I am healthy? If I will not be charged anything more for it when I become sick, then there is no rational economic reason for me to be covered when I am healthy. So what insurance companies tell you—what every insurance expert tells you is, if you require insurance compa-nies to charge the same between sick people and healthy people, then healthy people will not buy insurance. If I were advising someone, I am not sure I would tell them to buy insurance if they didn’t have to until they were sick. So the pools get so skewed with sick people and no healthy people that rates dramatically rise for everyone. Some estimates suggest that the rate increases would be 20 percent per year, compounding year after year after year. In the last version of this bill, Repub-licans knew that so they included a version of the individual mandate in their bill. Now, it wasn’t the same mandate, but it was a mandate none-theless. The mandate under the Afford-able Care Act says that if you don’t buy insurance, you will pay a fee on your taxes. What the Republican bill said—the version of TrumpCare that came very close to getting a vote on this floor—is that if you go without insurance, you will pay a penalty when you try to get back on. The timing of the penalty was just different. Under the Affordable Care Act, you pay it when you lose in-surance. Under the first version of TrumpCare, you would pay the penalty when you try to get back on insurance. It is a mandate. It is a penalty. It is just in a different place. Republicans did that because they knew that was the only way to require States or give States the option to con-tinue to require insurance companies to treat sick people the same as healthy people. So why am I talking about this? Be-cause in Graham-Cassidy, the indi-vidual mandate is totally gone—gone— replaced with nothing. Thus, even though it says that States, if they wanted to, could preserve protections for people with preexisting conditions, States did not do that because the Fed-eral Government does not require healthy people to have insurance. If you think that States are going to re-impose an individual mandate, A, there will be some real question as to wheth-er they can do that, and, B, they will not. They will not because that issue has become, thanks to my Republican friends, so politically toxic around the country. You will be left with massive dis-criminatory treatment of people with preexisting conditions, and nowhere for them to go because Medicaid is obliter-ated under this bill. Medicaid dollars get lumped into all the rest of the money. It gets sent to States, and then Medicaid dollars are capped going for-ward—intentionally capped—at a num-ber that is well below what the general rate of increase in the Medicaid Pro-gram is. There is intentionality to the underfunding of Medicaid here. Now, the old bill would have taken, I think, 15 million people off of the rolls of Medicaid. I think I am getting that number right, and we will never know what this number is before the vote happens. It is likely around the same number because this bill treats Med-icaid in roughly the same way, in terms of capping the amount of money States get. The formula by which States get this money is so wildly complicated that no one could understand it between now and next week. I would challenge any Republican, other than BILLCASSIDY  and L
INDSEY GRAHAM , to come down and give us an explanation as to how this formula works. It is the most bi-zarre Rube Goldberg scheme you could ever imagine, but in it is a dramatic re-duction in Medicaid payments to the State over time. So think about this little boy Dea-con. Deacon is 10 years old, and he lives in Ohio. I am just looking here at a pic-ture of him clutching a Pokemon char-acter. I know what Pokemon character this is. It is Pikachu. I know that be-cause I have a 9-year-old who is the same age as Deacon, but, for the grace of God, my 9-year-old is not going through what Deacon the 10-year-old is going through. I will just read a little bit about Dea-con. He loves playing baseball, playing video games, volunteering at animal shelters. He loves being a patient champion for children’s hospitals, spending time with his friends and fam-ily, being a big brother, raising money and awareness for heart disease and de-fects. Now, my 9-year-old doesn’t enjoy raising awareness for heart disease and defects. The reason Deacon enjoys doing that is because he has a condi-tion called hypoplastic left heart syn-drome. That is combined with asthma and acid reflux. It essentially means Deacon has half a heart. We have whole hearts. Deacon has half a heart. Right now, everything is controlled for Deacon by medications. He has had six heart surgeries to get to the point of stability. His heart will fail—not may fail. His heart will fail. He will go into heart failure, requiring a heart transplant. That is Deacon’s future. The heart cannot last on the two- chamber system that Deacon’s sur-geons put into place. Affordable, quality insurance means everything to Deacon. Strep throat could be a death sentence for him. Any little virus that gets into him and goes into his bloodstream, that is it—game over for 10-year-old Deacon. His parent writes: 
My child is alive because he has Medicaid. That allowed for him to have the doctors, the surgeons, and the care he has always needed. Deacon had 6 heart surgeries before 3 years of age. He has continued medications as well as regular doctors checkups as he needs them. Because of his diagnosis, he even has a specialist for simple things like dental care. If he had not had Medicaid coverage, there is no way I could have afforded his care. By his first surgery at 10 days, he was

over the million dollar mark. I would have lost our house easily, quickly. I am a single mom. Medicaid helps keep my son alive and healthy, and it has given me my best friend to love and watch grow up. 
Medicaid helps a boy live a normal life. Where we would have never thought that it would be possible, Med-icaid lets a boy with half a heart be on a baseball team with his friends, a best friend. This is not hyperbole. This isn’t a game. It is not about scoring political points just because you made a promise that you were going to repeal the Af-fordable Care Act in the first year that you had control of this body. This is about this little boy who lives in a State that had the wisdom, on a bipar-tisan basis, to expand Medicaid. Ohio would be one of the biggest los-ers under this bill—a massive with-drawal of billions of dollars away from Ohio’s healthcare system, simply to fulfill a political promise Republicans made. We are not making this up. We are not trying to tug your heartstrings just for our own political purposes. Kids are going to die if they don’t have access to healthcare. If 20 million peo-ple lose insurance, as may be the case under this legislation, thousands of people will not be able to survive. That is $1 million of care. I can guarantee you that this single parent’s home is not worth $1 million. At some point you just stop being able to provide the care necessary to keep people alive. Republicans are treating this like it is a game, talking about taking a vote next week when no one in this country has looked at this legislation. Not a single townhall has been held in which your constituents can weigh in. No Member of this body will have looked at an analysis by the Congressional Budget Office to know what its impact is. This bill will be rammed through in the dead of night, I guarantee you, without any input from people like Deacon and his family. This is the meanest version of TrumpCare yet, in part because of what is in it, in part because of the butchered process, but in part because Deacon’s family will not get to come down here and talk to you about it be-cause you are going to rush it through next week, if reports are to be believed. What a great trick Republicans will have pulled on this country. Everyone said that the repeal bill was dead, that we were going to move on to a bipar-tisan process in the HELP Committee, that the Senate was going to move on to another issue of tax reform. What a great head fake that would be if it were all a lie, if it were all a ruse just to be able to give cover for Republicans to quietly muster support for another devastating assault on America’s healthcare while Democrats were look-ing hopefully at a bipartisan process playing out in the HELP Committee that was never intended to result in an outcome. I hope that is not the case. I really do. I have put enormous faith and trust in Senator ALEXANDER . Admittedly, I gave him a very hard time over the course of the first 6 months of this year because I could not understand what the point was of being on the HELP Committee if we weren’t going to de-bate a reordering of one-fifth of the economy: the healthcare system. Why be a member of the HELP Committee if the biggest reform to the healthcare system during my tenure in the Senate wasn’t going to be debated in the HELP Committee? I thought that was an abomination. I have been very pleased that in the last 2 weeks Senator A
LEXANDER has convened a bipartisan process, which I have invested in. I have shown up to all of those hearings. I have talked to him over and over again on the floor of the Senate and in these committee meet-ings. I have offered constructive sug-gestions about how we can come up with a bipartisan fix to the parts of the Affordable Care Act that aren’t work-ing as well, while maintaining the parts that are working. As I sit here today, I hope and I pray this wasn’t all one big ruse to distract me and the Democratic Members of the Senate while Republicans quietly worked on building support for the meanest version of TrumpCare yet. That would be a deceit, and I hope it is not going to be the case. This isn’t a game. People are going to be really, terribly, badly hurt if this bill becomes law. I don’t even know what the effects will be because we don’t have the analysis. We don’t have a score. I can guess. But I have never been part of anything like this in my 20 years of public service. I have never seen a group of public officials so hell- bent on achieving a political goal as to throw out decades of precedent on how this body has normally worked on major pieces of legislation, shown such casual disregard for good, old-fashioned nonpartisan analysis as is happening if this bill comes to the floor without a CBO score. We can do something together. We can continue the work of the HELP Committee to pass a truly bipartisan product that admittedly would just be a start, that could involve real com-promise on both sides. Republicans could compromise by saying: We know we need to have some stability in these healthcare exchanges, and, thus, we are going to make sure that President Trump can’t take away payments from insurers or threaten to take them away on a month-to-month basis. Democrats can recognize that Republicans want flexibility in these exchanges—want the ability for States to do a little bit more innovation, whether it be with benefit design or reinsurance pools. We can both give, and we can get a product that would build trust between both sides, that might allow us to do some-thing bigger later on. I have no idea whether Deacon’s fam-ily is Republican or Democrat. I have no idea whether his single mother— who is so deeply fearful today of what Republicans are about to do to her and her child, her best friend, her 10-year- old son—voted for Donald Trump or voted for Hillary Clinton. When it hits you—when that heart defect or that schizophrenia or that heroin addiction or that lung cancer strikes you, it doesn’t discriminate as to whether you are a Democrat or Republican. It hits you hard no matter who you voted for. That is why, when we go back home— I know what Republicans hear because I hear it in Connecticut. They want us to work together. They are sick and tired of healthcare being a political football that just gets tossed from one party to the other. We used it to bludg-eon Republicans, and Republicans used it to bludgeon us, and we used it to bludgeon you, back and forth, and back and forth. We are on the verge of passing a bill, getting a bill out of the HELP Com-mittee that might begin to end the use of healthcare as a simple political bludgeon. That is what our constitu-ents want. We are not going to have time to get any public polling on this because no one is going to be able to understand it by next week, but I will guarantee you, it will poll at the same rate that previous versions of TrumpCare have polled—in the teens and the twenties, with base Trump vot-ers being the only folks who support it. That is because people have gotten hip to what is in here. They don’t actually think it is a good idea to take healthcare away from tens of millions of Americans, but they also don’t like the fact that this has been done behind closed doors. This has been done with Republicans only. They want this de-bate to occur in the open. Whether they are Republican or Democrat, they want both sides to be a part of it, and we are closer to that re-ality than ever before. Pulling the rug out from under the bipartisan process is not the meanest or cruelest part, but it is pretty high on the list. Think about Deacon. Think about the tens of thousands of little boys and girls like Deacon who live in your State. Don’t do this to the people of America. Don’t do this to the U.S. Sen-ate. Don’t break this place beyond rec-ognition by ramming this through without any process or without any CBO score next week. Let this bipar-tisan process play out. Let us build some good faith together. That is what the American people want, and that is what the American healthcare system needs. I yield the floor.

HONORING MARCELLA BARNES 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 18, 2017 Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask the House of Representatives to join me in recognizing the achievements of Marcella Barnes, the CEO and founder of Pink Hardhat Construction, LLC. Ms. Barnes, who was raised in New York, began her career immediately after she grad-uated from high school and went on to attend college in California. Once she moved to Cali-fornia, she had a dream to enlist in the military and make a difference in people’s lives. Upon enlisting, she was then stationed in Maryland, which is also where she opened her first busi-ness, Pink Hardhat Construction, LLC. How-ever, once her construction business started to gain traction, Ms. Barnes also noticed a need for providing housing to homeless vet-erans. As a veteran herself, she recognized and understood the challenges that homeless veterans face in obtaining quality, affordable housing. Ms. Barnes decided to do something about it and opened another business, Our Pink Doors, LLC, which provides shelter for homeless veterans. On July 9, 2017, she held a ribbon-cutting ceremony for the grand open-ing of her first veterans’ home. Ms. Barnes is also a member of the Na-tional Congress of Black Women and the Maryland Minority Contractors Association. Therefore, I ask the House of Representa-tives to join me in recognizing Marcella Barnes for her work.

INTRODUCTION OF THE SAFE COMMUNITIES ACT OF 2017 
HON. EARL BLUMENAUER 
OF OREGON  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 18, 2017 Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, more than 10 years ago, following Hurricane Katrina, then-Rep. Curt Weldon and I introduced the bipartisan Safe Communities Act. Today, with wildfires burning in my state and Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Jose´ravaging the South-east, the ability to prepare for, withstand, and quickly recover from disasters is an essential component of livable communities. That’s why I am reintroducing the Safe Communities Act, which will give state and local governments the tools to help them plan for and reduce the impact of these events. Federal investments in natural disasters should include prevention and mitigation as well as response and recovery. In fact, invest-ment in prevention can save money in the long-term. Research by an independent group of experts in 2005 found that every dollar in-vested in actions to reduce disaster losses saves the nation about $4 in future costs. We all agree that by planning for the future com-munities can help prevent damage and save money, but rarely do we do it. The Safe Communities Act will create a new grant program to support state, local and re-gional planning activities aimed at reducing threats posed by natural and human-caused disasters. Grant-eligible projects under this program include comprehensive risk assess-ments and inventories of critical infrastructure, land-use planning for natural hazards and ter-rorism security, updates to building codes and development of new urban design techniques for risk-reduction. The bill will also create a re-search program to investigate the best prac-tices in comprehensive land use and commu-nity planning aimed at reducing threats posed by natural hazards and acts of tenor. The number of people who live in harm’s way is expanding dramatically, and more prop-erties and more lives are at risk from both nat-ural and human-caused disasters. The associ-ated increases in rising disaster recovery costs impact us all. I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure communities have the resources they need to help prepare for future natural disasters. f 
WISHING A HAPPY 100TH BIRTH-DAY TO MS. PEARL GENEVIEVE MOORE 
HON. DAVID G. REICHERT 
OF WASHINGTON  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 18, 2017 Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise to con-gratulate Ms. Pearl Genevieve Moore of Pres-ton, WA on her 100th birthday today. Pearl was born in Washington State on September 18, 1917 to parents Hulda and Olaf Carlson, who immigrated to Preston, Washington from Varmland, Sweden. Pearl graduated from Broadway High School in 1935. In 1941, Pearl married the love of her life, Mr. Marshall Moore. They were married for 56 beautiful years. Pearl credits her wonderful life to God’s grace, her ancestors, and a busy social life. She is actively involved in her church commu-nity and many have been blessed by her hos-pitality and care over the years. Pearl also loves to garden and enjoys eating lots of vegetables, peanuts, and chocolate. Through her big heart and dedication to her community, Pearl has continued to make Preston a better place throughout her lifetime. I join with her family, friends, and the Eighth District in congratulating her on this special occasion and wishing her a wonderful birth-day. 16TH DISTRICT CONGRESSIONAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AWARDS HON. VERN BUCHANAN 
OF FLORIDA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 18, 2017 Mr. BUCHANAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Fire and Rescue and EMS per-sonnel who have provided distinguished serv-ice to the people of Florida’s 16th Congres-sional District. As first responders, fire departments and emergency medical service teams are sum-moned on short notice to serve their respec-tive communities. Oftentimes, they arrive at scenes of great adversity and trauma, to which they reliably bring strength and composure. These brave men and women spend hundreds of hours in training so that they are prepared when they get ‘‘the call.’’ In 2012, I established the 16th District Con-gressional Fire and Rescue and EMS Awards to honor officers, departments, and units for outstanding achievement. On behalf of the people of Florida’s 16th District, it is my privilege to congratulate the following winners, who were selected this year by an independent committee comprised of a cross section of current and retired Fire and Rescue personnel living in the district: Manatee County Community Paramedicine Program was chosen to receive the Congres-sional Unit Citation Award; Training Officer Christopher Stark of the Hillsborough County Fire Rescue was chosen to receive the Congressional Dedication and Professionalism Award; Chief Dennis Jones of the Hillsborough County Fire Rescue was chosen to receive the Congressional Career Service Award; and Division Chief-Fire Marshal Tammy Zurla was chosen to receive the Congressional Dedication and Professionalism Award.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 18, 2017 Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Missouri Association of Student Financial Aid Personnel (MASFAP) on their 50th Anniversary on November 7, 2017. The Missouri Association of Student Fi-nancial Aid was founded on April 3, 1967, starting with a steering committee of only five members. Today, MASFAP has grown to 83 schools and over 790 members. This anniver-sary will provide an opportunity to recognize their continued partnerships and highlight the need for affordable post-secondary education.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD —Extensions of RemarksE1238 September 18, 2017 
Since its founding, the MASFAP has and continues to be a dynamic association dedi-cated to serving and advocating for practi-tioners, users, and providers of student finan-cial aid programs. Many students depend on financial aid programs to assist them through their post-secondary education, providing many students with the means to continue their education. Missouri is home to many in-stitutions of post-secondary education that serve students from Missouri and abroad. Ob-taining a higher education opens doors for stu-dents, develops their individual skills and knowledge, and makes them invaluable re-sources to our communities, state, and nation. MASFAP is ready and willing to assist stu-dents who need help or information. The fi-nancial aid programs provided to students as-sist with tuition, fees, housing, food, books and supplies, transportation and personal ex-penses. Additionally, millions of dollars in grants, scholarships, and student loans allow students to continue pursuing their profes-sional goals. Every day, student financial aid administra-tors throughout Missouri do their best to assist students in identifying the resources and op-tions they have regarding the cost of their education. These administrators work at re-moving barriers so students can be successful in choosing the appropriate assistance pro-gram. The dedication these administrators show to the students and their future is appre-ciated. I ask you to join me in recognizing the Mis-souri Association of Student Financial Aid Per-sonnel on their 50th Anniversary Celebration.

HONORING MARY ‘‘EDITH’’ LOCKARD 
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 18, 2017 Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, communities thrive when hard work, dedication, and sac-rifice are set by the example of its residents. In Yonkers, no one has set that example bet-ter than Mary ‘‘Edith’’ Lockard. Edith was born in Yonkers in 1924 to An-drew and Mary Lena Deloatch. She was the youngest of 6 and the only girl. After grad-uating from Yonkers High School, Edith earned her Associates Degree in Early Child-hood Development from Pace University. Edith has been the life-blood of Messiah Baptist Church for over 76 years. In April of 1940 she was baptized on Easter Sunday at the church, and has remained an active mem-ber serving the parish in any capacity needed. Following high school, Edith focused on raising her family with her husband, Wilfred Lockard. She got involved volunteering in the Yonkers school district and eventually served as the Vice President of the Parents Teachers Association (PTA). She also served at the South Yonkers Youth Council, an organization dedicated to fostering growth and develop-ment for the youth in the community through after school care and activities. They also held summer day camps which exposed the youth to cultural and sporting events, positive role models, and educational opportunities. After her beloved husband Wilfred passed away, Edith began volunteering at St. John’s Hospital. She faithfully served in the mailroom on Thursdays from 1995 to 2001. In 1995 she also became a member of the Nepperhan Senior Center—Senior Group No. 15—located on Warburton Avenue. For over a decade, Edith has faithfully worked for the Yonkers Parks and Recreation. For as active as Edith is in the community, her true passion has always been her family. She is the proud mother of her four children: Juanita, Tyrone, Lindsay, and Lila, she has eight grandchildren, seven great grand-children, and, remarkably, 9 great-great grand-children. Edith’s commitment to helping others has been an inspiration to those in her community and beyond. I want to congratulate Edith for all of her hard, selfless work, and I want to wish her a very happy 93rd birthday on Sep-tember 9, 2017. f 
BERT HACK 
HON. MIMI WALTERS 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 18, 2017 Mrs. MIMI WALTERS of California. Mr. Speaker, on March 24, 1999, Laguna Woods, California officially became Orange County’s 32nd city. A great deal has changed in the last 18 years, but Laguna Woods Councilman Bert Hack has remained a constant in our commu-nity. Since taking office in 1999, Bert served as Mayor five times and sat on numerous boards throughout Southern California. Bert’s deep knowledge of local history and passion for service to others has made him a beloved fixture in Laguna Woods. Bert’s presence on the City Council will surely be missed, but he will undoubtedly con-tinue to serve as an inspiration for all who fol-low in his footsteps. I wish Bert well in retirement, and thank him for his many years of service to Laguna Woods and Orange County.

HONORING SADIE M. MACCHIA 
HON. LEE M. ZELDIN 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 18, 2017 Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Sadie Macchia, who celebrated her 100th bitihday on July 6th, Born on July 6, 1917, in the Bronx, New York, Sadie came into this world with a re-markably low birth weight, and was the sur-viving child of a set of twins, the other of whom was born prematurely and sadly passed away shortly afterward. Sadie was so small that her mother used a shoebox as a cradle, and could not even properly wear a bonnet. With such a low birthweight, her chances for survival seemed slim. Yet, with incredible strength, this miracle baby pulled through in-fancy and is still here with us today, 100 years later. As an adult, Sadie spent many years work-ing as a seamstress in the Bronx while living in her own apartment above her brother, Dominick, and his wife, Angelina. In those days, Sadie was renowned for her hospitality and insatiable laughter, always happy to have friends and family over to share a meal, remi-nisce over old photos, or simply spend time with those dearest to her. A kind and gen-erous soul, she is truly loved by all who know her. To commemorate her 100th birthday, two of her brothers, Guy and Nick, threw her a birth-day party where she was able to celebrate with her extended fmnily. The look on her face to see so many loved ones gathered together to celebrate her birthday was said to be that of pure joy. This miracle baby fought all the odds and is now one of America’s great centennials. It is a privilege to honor Sadie Macchia, who has brought joy and laughter into the hearts of so many others. f

National Convention on their 27th An-nual event and to recognize past and present members. I commend their community service and civic engagement that benefit not only the local Asian community in New York City but also the national and international community. The Association is a charitable organization with a focus on community, education, civic engagement and social welfare. Since its in-ception over 125 years ago, the Moy Family Association has played a key role in commu-nity building efforts, particularly in the vibrant Chinatown communities I represent.

In particular, I congratulate Mr. Robin Mui for his public service. His accomplishments and contributions to the Asian community I represent is immeasurable. Mr. Mui has been instrumental in increasing awareness and dia-logue about issues and concerns that impact Asian American communities. Through their leadership, the Moy Family Association has championed numerous community causes and relief efforts for families impacted by tragedy. This includes raising millions of dollars for the American Red Cross during Hurricane Katrina and for the families of slain NYPD Officers Wenjian Liu and Officer Rafael RaInos in 2014. As a nation, we must embrace the diverse cultures and organizations that have worked to advance the needs of all citizens and have helped to define what it means to be Amer-ican. I ask my colleagues to join me today in congratulating the Moy’s Family Association U.S.A. National Convention on this special oc-casion. I commend their public service and shared goal of enriching the lives of the con-stituents of my district. My best wishes for a successful event.

REMARKS BY STEPHEN W. CAMP 
HON. JOHN B. LARSON 
OF CONNECTICUT  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 18, 2017 Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to include in the R
ECORD remarks made by the Reverend Stephen W. Camp at the Be the Light Interfaith Candle Lighting Vigil at Congregation Beth Israel in West Hartford, CT on August 23, 2017. 
THEREVEREND STEPHEN W. C AMP, M.D IV., S
ENIOR PASTOR , F AITH CONGREGATIONAL  C
HURCH OF HARTFORD , CT ‘‘The prophetic voice Maya Angelou once said, ‘I’ve learned that people will forget what you have said; people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.’ America was sent a message recently, a message that America rarely feels as deeply. As America watched the unfolding story cen-tered in the little sleepy college town in Vir-ginia. it was forced to feel, the kind of feel-ing that one never forgets. It was reminis-cent of Selma and ‘‘Bloody Sunday.’’ It brought to mind Birmingham with the dog and fire hoses; it reminded America of the open hostility and defiance of a George Wal-lace. As America watched in recent days, some were stirred by the memory of ances-tors and family members being marched into ovens, reminded of some of the worst inhu-manity that our world has produced. The genie, we thought, was back in the tightly dosed bottle, the monster was locked away in its cage, but here it was again raring it ugly head, saying, ‘‘I’m not dead yet! Amer-ica felt pain once again. For some I’m sure, it simply felt like a scab had been ripped off an old wound. Still others may have thought these days were be-hind us, a past just-as-soon forgotten. But lest we forget, lest we ignore for even a mo-ment—this pain rooted in forced Indian res-ervations and the buying and selling of human beings, lest we forget, it will surely surface and seek to cause havoc and pain until it is faced and fixed. The events of late teach all of us, as if any had doubt; that America is not healed yet. The work is not done. It seems just yesterday that Jewish cemeteries were vandalized, or just the other day that terrorist bombed a mosque or burned churches in the south. Were they just isolated incidents? No, but somehow they connected us and called us to feel, to be awake, to be alert—to mobilize for good. And here we are again. Charlottesville conjured up old feelings. Many who marched in Charlottesville that day, as we watched, most of us glued to the television, as they boldly marched, unhooded this time, khaki wearing white men, with their contorted angry faces, and carrying tiki torches, trying it seemed to desperately symbolize their power, their might, but only succeeding to pull back the scab and memory of historic oppression, failing to offer even a flickering of light, and of peace. We watched with sadness while they shouted hateful words and embodied a most detestable part of the American mosaic, frankly, only mak-ing many of us remember and feel the acute sickness that is still a part of America. For those who marched with counter intent, with ‘‘never again’’ etched upon their hearts, with ‘‘non-violent direct action’’ embedded in their spirit, many of them young people who have gotten the lessons that many of us who are older have tried to teach. So many coun-teracted and confronted, they stood tall and whether we liked it or not, they stood their ground and they gave us hope that one day the pain would give way to promise. We can take heart, because through them we knew that ‘‘we shall indeed, overcome.’’ But dearly, we have not yet reached that Promised Land. We have not yet fully em-braced the place that Dr. King and Rabbi Hershel who marched arm in arm tried to show and to teach us. We haven’t yet felt how Malcom who epitomized both the hope and the worry of the movement for justice, worry that integrity in the movement would be comprised given the times they were in, yet united with a yearning to taste real free-dom for all. All of them understood that jus-tice had a cost attached to it. However, we still haven’t learned yet, how to include all the voices, sit with all the pain, open and feel all of the diverse ways we are together, but there is hope shining through, maybe given the Boston event, that we will get there. The beloved community will one day be! Think of the blueprint that was left to us, the light that was given and passed to us, as they each in their own ways, gave their lives to pass on to us, a real hope for a better tomorrow. What I guess Charlottesville has chal-lenged me to do, is to keep singing songs of justice, keep speaking words of peace. The challenge is to sing a new song in this often strange land, this place where America is still striving to form a more perfect union, this place where free speech should always be celebrated, must always be protected, but never allowed by any to be abused. We are called to sing together the words of peace, the words of hope, sing so as to feel that hope and that peace until it is never forgot-ten, until it is so deeply felt that no one is left behind without voice or value. So we come together again, gathered by the many ways God gathers us, we come to-gether to sing even when we may not feel like singing, sing even though the words may not always be dear to us or the language un-derstood by everyone is not plain. We come together to share words of peace, even when it seems the world is bent upon acts of vio-lent expression. We come together knowing that love trumps hate, that without love and hope we perish, so we hope, we believe and work for a better day. Maya Angelou was right, people will never forget—when it is felt. It is our work, to help each other feel the presence of peace. It’s our work to care for one another, to bind up those who are broken, to repair the world and make the world a just place for all. This is our work to feel, not the hate that some would have us feel, but to offer a binding, sustaining and enduring feeling that builds community and opens hearts to know and feel that another world is possible. It is there, don’t you feel it, can’t you see it? It is there, just over the horizon. Let’s go there together! Thank you.’’ f PERSONAL EXPLANATION

DESIGNATION OF MAPLE VALLEY, WASHINGTON AS A PURPLE HEART CITY 
HON. DAVID G. REICHERT 
OF WASHINGTON  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 18, 2017 Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize the City of Maple Valley, in light of its designation as a Purple Heart City. The City of Maple Valley will be the first in Wash-ington’s Eighth Congressional District to be-come a Purple Heart, as well as the third city in the State of Washington. Additionally, the designation falls on the anniversary of 9/11, an event that will forever be seen in our hearts as a symbol of strength, hope, and freedom. The Purple Heart is awarded to wounded members of the armed forces of the United States as a combat decoration for their com-mitment to our great country. As you visit the City of Maple Valley, you will find a road sign explaining the Purple Heart significance, which reminds all those visiting, of the sacrifice made for a just and free civilization. Further-more, I would like to also thank the Boy Scout Troop 711 for building the display case for the plaques and other Purple Heart memorabilia, for the public to observe, learn and enjoy. I thank the City of Maple Valley for its dedi-cation to our armed forces who’ve risked their lives for ours. The City will not only be known as a beautiful place for wilderness, recreation and to raise a family; but one as an allegiance to our public servants.

RECOGNIZING GOUVERNEUR HEALTH 
HON. NYDIA M. VELA´ZQUEZ 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 18, 2017 Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Gouverneur Health and its dedi-cated professional staff and volunteers for the critical work they are doing for patients and families in New York City. Gouverneur Health is a Medicare and Med-icaid certified center. It is one of the largest in-stitutions in Lower Manhattan, and the largest freestanding ambulatory care center in New York State. Gouverneur Health has taken care of the ever-changing population of the Lower East Side for more than a century. Gouverneur’s dedicated and professional staff removes bar-riers caused by language, culture and income, enabling patients to make informed decisions vital to their physical, mental and social well- being. With Gouverneur’s help, our neighbors re-ceive important disease prevention information and screenings to ensure a healthy future for children and hard-working families. These im-portant services have grown and evolved over the past century, proving that the hospital is responsive to the needs of the community. As they celebrate 132 years of tremendous work, I am confident that NYC Health + Hos-pitals Gouverneur will continue to build on its history of service and find many more years of success.

HONORING ANGELO R. MARTINELLI 
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 18, 2017 Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor my friend and former colleague in gov-ernment, Angelo R. Martinelli, who has done so much to strengthen and promote the Yon-kers community and beyond. Though known as a Yonkers staple, Angelo was actually born in the Bronx and grew up in Mt. Vernon. After graduating from high school, he enlisted in the United States Army and was honorably discharged in 1946 with the rank of Sergeant. Upon returning home, Angelo worked in the family business, The Yonkers Daily Times, and in 1948 he bought the Gazette Press, the oldest printing firm in Westchester County. In 1973, Angelo was elected Mayor of the City of Yonkers. He served from 1974 to 1979 and again from 1982 to 1987, making him the longest-tenured mayor of Yonkers. During his career, Angelo held a number of other offices and positions in national and state organiza-tions, which earned him a reputation as an ef-fective and forceful advocate for municipal government interests, especially in the areas of senior-citizen and anti-crime programs. In addition, Angelo has served on the Board of Directors of the Yonkers Police Athletic League since 1991 and as Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Yonkers Chamber of Commerce for 22 years. In 1976, he was one of the founding members of the Untermyer Performing Arts Council. He previously served on the Board of St. Joseph’s Medical Center and was Chairman of the Advisory Board of St. Patrick’s Home for the Aged and Infirm. He was also the President of the Queen’s Daugh-ters Day Care Center, and, in January 1984, Mercy College conferred upon him an Hon-orary Doctorate of Humane Letters. Angelo has always been a passionate man when it comes to public service, but his great-est passion and love always belonged to his family. He was married to his beloved late wife, Carol, for 65 years. Together their family grew to include their six sons, five daughters- in-law, twelve grandchildren, and seven great- grandchildren. In 2016, Angelo once again demonstrated his commitment and love for the City of Yonkers, by donating the funds to re-store the Temple of Love at the historic Untermyer Gardens in memory of his late wife, Carol. The donation served as a beautiful trib-ute to both his city and the amazing woman he loved. It is truly an honor to have a friend like An-gelo, just as it is an honor for me to recognize him here today. I thank Angelo for his years of service to our community. Yonkers is surely a better place for all he has done on its be-half. f 
DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, ENVIRONMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2018 
SPEECH OF  
HON. JOE COURTNEY 
OF CONNECTICUT  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, September 12, 2017 
The House in Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union had under consideration the bill (H.R. 3354) making ap-propriations for the Department of the Inte-rior, environment, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2018, and for other purposes: 
Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Chair, I rise in support of my amendment numbered 86 to Division C of H.R. 3354 printed in House Report 115–297 to direct the National Institute of Standards and Technology to establish standards for ac-ceptable levels of pyrrhotite in concrete aggre-gate, and to continue providing technical as-sistance to those interested in pyrrhotite de-tection, prevention, and mitigation tools. Pyrrhotite is a rare natural mineral that has been found in higher than normal concentra-tions in stone aggregate used in concrete poured for residential foundations in northern Connecticut and Massachusetts. Over time, pyrrhotite oxidizes, expanding within the foun-dation and causing the foundation wall to bow and crack. Severe cracking weakens the foun-dation to the point of collapse over a period of 10–15 years, and potentially thousands of homeowners in the region could see their homes collapse. By establishing standards for pyrrhotite con-tent, NIST could prevent a similar problem from occurring in residential buildings in other areas. In addition, providing technical assist-ance to those already affected by this problem will help establish best practices for mitigation of pyrrhotite-related damage. I look forward to continuing to work with the Appropriations Committee and the agency on this important issue, and I urge the adoption of my amend-ment. f 
HONORING BARBARA GRIMM-MAR-SHALL AND KARI GRIMM-ANDER-SON FOR THEIR DEDICATED COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT 
HON. KEVIN McCARTHY 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 18, 2017 Mr. M
CCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today and am joined by my colleague from Cali-fornia, Mr. V
ALADAO , to recognize two out-standing leaders in our community: Barbara Grimm-Marshall and Kari Grimm-Anderson. Throughout the years, Barbara and Kari have been deeply involved in our community and it comes as no surprise they have each been named by the Kern County Fair as 2017 Per-son of the Year. Every year, the Kern County Fair attracts families from all over the Central Valley to par-take in the unique festivities ranging from the Great American Duck Race to the highly-com-petitive 4–H livestock showcases. However, we also take time to acknowledge and pay tribute to individuals who have improved our community with the Person of the Year award. While Barbara and Kari may be known for their leadership roles with the world’s largest carrot operation through their family-owned farm, Grimmway Enterprises, Inc., they have each played an integral part in the betterment of our community. Notably, in 1998, Grimmway Enterprises created a college scholarship program for the children of their employees that has provided access to higher education through more than 300 college scholarships. Through their philanthropic endeavors, Bar-bara and Kari have been instrumental in help-ing students in rural regions of the Central Valley prepare for college, while also working to address the increasing prevalence of child-hood diabetes and obesity through various programs and outreach efforts. Barbara founded and currently serves as the CEO of the Grimm Family Education Foundation and has worked tirelessly to estab-lish rural charter schools throughout Kern County to ensure students have access to a world-class education. In August 2011, the Foundation opened the Grimmway Academy in Arvin, California, enrolling more than 280 students Kindergarten through third grade. Today, the Academy has two campuses, one in Arvin and the other in Shafter, with total en-rollment surpassing 1,200 students for the 2017–2018 school year. Additionally, the Foundation recently opened the Buena Vista Edible Schoolyard, dedicated to exposing stu-dents to the many facets of agricultural and environmental stewardship in the region. Kari is widely known for her insight and con-tributions to a number of civically-minded groups, including the Board of Directors for the Junior League of Bakersfield and the Board of Regents at Concordia University, Irvine. Similarly, Barbara has dedicated her time serving on various boards, such as the Lori Brock Children’s Museum, St. John’s Lu-theran Church, the California State University

Foundation, the Regents of Concordia Univer-sity, and the Board of Directors of Tejon Ranch, among others. The selfless efforts of Barbara and Kari have impacted so many and both have set an exceptional example for all of us to follow as we work to improve our community. Through investing in education to providing resources to those less fortunate, Barbara and Kari are steadfast in their vision and commitment to helping others. We congratulate Barbara and Kari for jointly being named the 2017 Kern County Person of the Year and commend them for their tireless service, work, and vision for our community. We look forward to wit-nessing their continued efforts that touch the hearts of so many.

HONORING THE SERVICE OF CRAIG ANDERSON 
HON. JARED HUFFMAN 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 18, 2017 Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Craig Anderson and his 20 years of active stewardship as the Executive Director of LandPaths, a non-profit organiza-tion in Sonoma County that has become a na-tional innovator in land conservation practices under his leadership. Craig Anderson’s career has consistently engaged his dual passions of land conserva-tion and community engagement. Beginning in 1985, Mr. Anderson worked at the Yosemite Institute where he taught field science courses to high school students. Four years later he became the Director of Outdoor Classroom Programs for the Ojai Valley School, leading students on wilderness trips that exposed some of them to land use and natural history curriculum for the first time. During that same period, Mr. Anderson took his knowledge from the classroom and applied it in the field, when he became the site manager for the McCloud River Preserve. As the site manager he oversaw all activities taking places across the 2,200 acre preserve on a daily basis. All of these experiences prepared Mr. Anderson for his next role as the Executive Director of Land Paths, a position he took on in 1997, and con-tinues to hold to this day. As the Executive Director of Land Paths, Mr. Anderson has grown the organization from a single staff member working out of his apart-ment to a staff of 15. Pushing the organiza-tion’s mission of connecting people to nature, Mr. Anderson successfully spearheaded the agency’s efforts to create nature preserves with public access. LandPaths has created five such preserves throughout Sonoma Coun-ty as a result of his leadership to date. In addi-tion to these efforts, Mr. Anderson led the de-velopment of the award winning Bayer-Farm Park & Community Garden, which has now been held up as a model for expanding green spaces in urban areas. Because of his fore-sight in developing local preserves and com-munity gardens, LandPaths has also been able to create student and community stew-ardship programs that use these properties to ensure the public’s commitment to environ-mental conservation and land use practices. Beyond the local impact of Mr. Anderson’s leadership, he has also been recognized on a national level for his innovative practices and stewardship programs. Mr. Speaker, please join me in expressing deep appreciation for Craig Anderson’s ex-traordinary leadership in the field of land use, conservation and stewardship, by extending to him congratulations on his two decades of service. f 
SUPPORTING THE LEGAL SERVICES CORPORATION 
HON. DAVID G. REICHERT 
OF WASHINGTON  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 18, 2017 Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise in sup-port of the Legal Services Corporation and its important work across the country in facili-tating civil legal aid for those in need. Civil legal aid is one of the most effective strategies for helping victims of domestic vio-lence and that is why our federal government must make a strong investment in the Legal Services Corporation (LSC), which administers federal funding for civil legal aid. From my over 33 years in law enforcement, I know all too well that unlike people who commit crimes, victims do not always have the same opportunity for an attorney. For a low-in-come individual in need of help with a civil legal issue, paying expensive legal fees for an attorney is not an option. And for people who are in abusive relationships, the thought of navigating the legal system alone can often be what keeps them from leaving their abuser. Research shows that providing an attorney can reduce the number of domestic violence victims by as much as 21 percent. A 2015 study out of King County, WA, where I was the Sheriff, found that when survivors received legal representation they were 85 percent more likely to have child visitation rights de-nied to the abusive parent, 77 percent more likely to have restrictions placed on the abu-sive parent’s child visitation, and 47 percent more likely to have treatment ordered for the abusive parent. Our great nation was founded on the prin-ciple of justice for all, not just for those who can afford it. When low-income families and survivors of domestic violence are forced to face the justice system on their own, it is a failure of our society. As the appropriations process moves forward, I urge you to support and strengthen funding for the Legal Services Corporation.

RECOGNIZING MARK GOTTO 
HON. MIKE COFFMAN 
OF COLORADO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 18, 2017 Mr. COFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my appreciation to Mark Gotto, Cen-tennial City Council Member for District 3 Mark Gotto, for his many years of hard work and dedication to the City of Centennial. Council Member Gotto’s leadership and vision has, amongst other accomplishments, contributed to the City of Centennial’s reputation as one of the best in Colorado. Council Member Gotto has consistently and effectively guided the City of Centennial to-wards a more business-friendly atmosphere that increases growth and the quality of life. He has continually provided his guidance and leadership as the City Council Liaison to a va-riety of different boards and committees, such as the Centennial Budget Committee, the Southgate Water and Sanitation District, and the Arapahoe Library District Board of Trust-ees. Outside of his service on the Centennial City Council, Council Member Gotto has also dedicated his time making our community and the State of Colorado a better place. He con-tinues to volunteer at the Children’s Hospital of Colorado on the Anschutz Medical Campus and ensures that the Centennial City Council does not pass any resolution that would nega-tively affect the aging population in his city. Mr. Speaker, City Council Member Mark Gotto represents the very best the State of Colorado and our nation has to offer in public service. I offer my sincere appreciation for his unyielding dedication to public service, and I wish him the very best of luck as he leaves the Centennial City Council and moves on to future endeavors. f 
HONORING THE 50TH ANNIVER-SARY OF THE SMITHSONIAN’S ANACOSTIA COMMUNITY MU-SEUM 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 18, 2017 Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask the House of Representatives to join me in honoring the 50th Anniversary of the Smithsonian’s Anacostia Community Museum. The Anacostia Community Museum, which opened in 1967, has been a staple of the Dis-trict of Columbia community. Not only has the museum served as a major cultural institution, including in highlighting the important contribu-tions made by African Americans to D.C. and the nation, but it has also served as a pillar of educational enrichment and achievement through its Museum Academy Program. In ad-dition, the museum’s Citizen Scientist Program brings high school students and Smithsonian educators, as well as scientists, together to engage in environmental stewardship and learn more about science, technology, engi-neering and mathematics initiatives. The museum also continues to be a domi-nant force in terms of community engagement, creating a hands-on children’s room and a youth advisory council. Additionally, the mu-seum works on a number of events and projects that focus on community restoration within Anacostia. For example, the museum recently hosted a community forum with the National Park Service to illustrate the impor-tance of volunteering within one’s community and also partnered with WTTG Fox 5 to allow visitors to participate in an urban gardening project. Aside from its community engagement and restoration, the Anacostia Community Museum showcases various exhibits that focus on the different issues that impact urban commu-nities, both in D.C. and nationwide. Specifi-cally, the museum works with D.C. residents, artists, community activists, scholars, local offi-cials and other outside organizations to cul-tivate carefully crafted exhibits that challenge

CELEBRATING THE 50TH ANNIVER-SARY OF JONATHAN WILLIAMS PLAZA 
HON. NYDIA M. VELA´ZQUEZ 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 18, 2017 Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 50th Anniversary of Jonathan Williams Plaza, a New York City Public Hous-ing Authority (NYCHA) development located in my district in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. This complex is home to more than 1,340 resi-dents. Built at the height of the Civil Rights movement, and three decades after the New Deal and the 1934 Federal Housing Act, Wil-liams Plaza’s towering buildings have long symbolized innovation and hope. Williams Plaza has provided a sound foun-dation and pathway to self-sufficiency for thou-sands of its residents. The stability it provides families is what helped launch the educational achievement and careers of former public housing residents like U.S. Supreme Court Sonia Sotomayor. Williams Plaza provides meaningful support and services for its residents. Under NYCHA’s Family Partnerships initiative, residents are able to connect to critical resources that help support family stability and tenancy. It offers job training opportunities, on-site afterschool partnership and accessible childcare in addi-tion to NYCHA’s city-wide network of social services. On this special 50th year celebration, I also would like to recognize the Jonathan Williams Plaza Tenant Association for their vol-unteerism. The community service they pro-vide improves the quality of life for their neigh-bors and surrounding community. They are a valuable asset to NYCHA and the resident stakeholders. I also want to recognize Mr. Juan Bello, Housing Manager and his team for their unwavering dedication to residents. I sa-lute the following: Mr. Joel Gross—Tenant Association Presi-dent Ben Zion Weiss—Vice-President Abraham Frankel—Treasurer Joanne Sanchez—Corresponding Secretary Joel Schwartz—Secretary Louise Sanon—Sergeant At Arms Housing Manager—Mr. Juan Bello Superintendent—Marian Polowcyk Housing Assistant—Nina Dinkevich Maintenance Staffer—Efrain Quintana Caretaker—Andrew Adams Resident Volunteer—Abraham Frankel Resident Volunteer—Pedro Roman HONORING MAJOR GENERAL GREGORY S. CHAMPAGNE HON. BLAINE LUETKEMEYER 
OF MISSOURI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 18, 2017 Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the retirement of Major General Gregory S. Champagne who will retire from the United States Air Force and the Missouri Air National Guard on November 1, 2017 with 36 years of dedicated service. Since his com-missioning, Major General Champagne has spent his career as a Missouri Air National Guardsman and currently serves as the Air National Guard Advisor to the Commander, Air Force Global Strike Command at the Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana where training, equipping, and maintenance for all United States intercontinental ballistic missile and bomber forces are conducted. The Air Force Global Strike Command provides stra-tegic deterrence, global strike, and combat support and houses the nation’s inventory of Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missiles, B–1, B–2, and B–52 bomber aircraft under its nine wings. In 1981, Major General Champagne re-ceived his commission through the Academy of Military Science. He has served on numer-ous assignments such as wing staff assign-ments, logistics and flying operations and has flown in combat missions in Operations Pro-vide Comfort and Southern Watch. Further-more, he commanded the 207th Air Expedi-tionary Group at Tallil Air Base, in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Prior to his current post, Major General Champagne was Com-mander, 131st Bomb Wing, Missouri Air Na-tional Guard, and Whiteman Air Force Base. At Whiteman, he oversaw the National Guard’s only B–2 unit that provides nearly 1,100 combat-ready Airmen for both state and federal missions. Throughout his many years of service, Major General Champagne has received nu-merous awards and decorations including: Le-gion of Merit with oak leaf cluster, Bronze Star Medal, Meritorious Service Medal with two oak leaf clusters, Air Force Commendation Medal, Army Commendation Medal, Air Force Achievement Medal, Joint Meritorious Unit Award, Air Force Outstanding Unit Award with oak leaf cluster, Combat Readiness Medal with two silver oak leaf clusters and two bronze oak leaf clusters, National Defense Service Medal with bronze star, Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal with bronze star, and Iraq Campaign Medal with bronze star. Major General Champagne intends to spend precious moments with his wife, Cheri Cham-pagne and his sons, 1st Lieutenant Clayton Champagne and wife, Cara, and Captain Tyler Champagne and wife, Kris and his grandson Nicolas. I ask you to join me in recognizing this dis-tinguished public servant, Major General Greg-ory S. Champagne on his retirement after 36 years of dedicated service to our nation.
