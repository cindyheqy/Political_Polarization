During these days for recess, a time when our work and rest meet us else-where, when many of our citizens mark religious holidays, and when the winter months give way to spring, send Your spirit to renew us, to help us learn from the history we inherited, to sus-tain the values which define our home-land, to work for a more just future, sensitive to the weakest among us. We pray with the hope that when we work for unity and peace, we see a lit-tle more heaven among us. Amen.

HONORING AMY THOMAS AT BOLTON FAMILY HEALTH CLINIC 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, March 29, 2018 Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speak-er, I rise today to honor Mrs. Amy Thomas and the Bolton Family Health Clinic. Amy Thomas was born to Robert and Jea-nette Shoulders on October 17, 1977 in Jack-son, MS. She has an older sister, Tequella Shoulders, who is a Registered Nurse (RN) and is currently pursuing her degree in Psy-chiatric Nurse Practitioner. Amy has been hap-pily married 3 years to her lovable and sup-portive husband, Michael J. Thomas, who is a savvy Businessman, plus Co-Owner, Adminis-trator, and Billing/Coder for the Bolton Family Clinic. Ultimately, Amy loves embracing and practicing her Christian lifestyle where she continuously gives God all the praise and puts Him first in all her endeavors. Also, Amy en-joys caring and helping others, participating in volunteer services, traveling, and mingling with family and friends. Amy Thomas began the long road to be-coming a Family Nurse Practitioner by grad-uating from Bailey Magnet High School. She then earned her BS degree in Nursing from the University of Southern Mississippi where she became an RN. Striving to achieve the goal of advancing her nursing career, Amy ac-complished that goal. Here, she obtained her Master of Science in Nursing from the Univer-sity of Southern Mississippi where she special-ized in Advance Family Nursing Practice and graduated with Dean Honors in 2011 and be-came certified by the American Academy of Nurse Practitioners to practice as a Family Nurse Practitioner. Then in 2014, Amy also became a certified DOT Medical Examiner to help promote and maintain transportation safe-ty. In relation, at this present time, she is now furthering her education even more by pur-suing a Doctoral in Nursing Practice degree from the University of South Alabama special-izing in Family Clinical Practice. Amy Thomas developed a strong 14 years of nursing background by working as an RN in Telemetry/MICU at the University of Medical Center, SICU at the Veteran Affairs Medical Center, and LTAC at Regency Hospital of Jackson. Then, after obtaining her Advance Practice Registered Nursing degree as a Fam-ily Nurse Practitioner, Amy worked 4 years to provide quality Geriatric care to residents in the Nursing Home and Primary Care to pa-tients at Minor Med Care Clinic. One year later, Amy then ventured out and became owner (along with her husband) at the Bolton Family Clinic in the town of Bolton, MS. Here, Amy is presently the sole healthcare provider in the Bolton community. She has future goals of incorporating more specialty services in Bolton so that the residents could have all their healthcare needs met in their own com-munity. This way, quality healthcare could be effectively disseminated with the ultimate goal of building a healthier Bolton community. Amy is affiliated with the following organiza-tions: Mississippi Nurses Association, Mis-sissippi Rural Health Association, American Association of Nurse Practitioners, American Nurses Association and Mississippi Associa-tion for Nurse Practitioners. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Mrs. Amy Thomas for her dedi-cation to serving throughout her community and throughout organizations around Mis-sissippi and the Bolton Family Clinic.

SANDRA LOVE 
HON. DONALD NORCROSS 
OF NEW JERSEY  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, March 29, 2018 Mr. NORCROSS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of the late Sandra Love, a constituent of New Jersey’s First Con-gressional District and distinguished public servant. Mrs. Love served as a New Jersey General Assemblywoman, representing the State’s Fourth Legislative District. Prior to ‘‘Sandi’s’’ tenure in the Legislature, she was the long time mayor of Gloucester Township, New Jer-sey, serving three terms from 1994 to 2006. Among Mrs. Love’s Mayoral accomplish-ments: the establishment of an Economic De-velopment Advisory Committee, forming the Gloucester Township Human Relations Com-mittee, creating a welfare-to-work program, developing the Gloucester Township Ministe-rial, and assisting in an effort that raised a substantial amount of relief funds for the vic-tims of Hurricane Katrina. In addition, Sandi Love was a board mem-ber for the Council on Affordable Housing, served on the Gloucester Township Housing Authority, was a member of the Gloucester Township Scholarship Committee, and was a trustee for Camden County Health Services. Despite her many public constituents and busy schedule, Sandi Love actively volun-teered in the community she loved, contrib-uting her time to the Special Olympics and serving as a trustee for the Mainstage Center for the Performing Arts. For her dedicated civic engagement and commitment to help others in her advocacy, Mrs. Love was honored with the Women Who Make a Difference Award, a Blackwood Rotary Club Paul Harris fellowship, the Camden County Martin Luther King, Jr. award, and a YWCA Award. Mrs. Love was the wife of Al, mother to Jason (Sara) and Jeffrey (Jen), and grand-mother to Cordelia, Sophia, Ian, and August. She will be deeply missed by her family, friends, neighbors, community members, and colleagues in public service. Mr. Speaker, Sandi Love was an excep-tional community leader. Mrs. Love’s service, sacrifice, and compassion will forever endure in South Jersey. I ask you to join me in hon-oring the memory of The Honorable Sandra Love. COST ESTIMATE ON H.R. 5089, STRENGTHENING LOCAL TRANS-PORTATION SECURITY CAPABILI-TIES ACT OF 2018 HON. MICHAEL T. McCAUL 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, March 29, 2018 Mr. M
CCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I include in the R
ECORD the following cost estimate for H.R. 5089, Strengthening Local Transportation Se-curity Capabilities Act of 2018, prepared by the Congressional Budget Office, which was not made available to the Committee at the time of filing of the legislative report. 
U.S. C ONGRESS , C
ONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE , Washington, DC, March 26, 2018. Hon. M
ICHAEL MCCAUL, Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. D
EAR MR. CHAIRMAN : The Congressional Budget Office has prepared the enclosed cost estimate for H.R. 5089, the Strengthening Local Transportation Security Capabilities Act of 2018. If you wish further details on this esti-mate, we will be pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is Megan Carroll. Sincerely, K
EITH HALL, Director. Enclosure. H.R. 5089—S
TRENGTHENING LOCAL TRANSPOR -
TATION SECURITY CAPABILITIES ACT OF 2018 As passed by the House of Representatives on March 22, 2018 
SUMMARY  Under current law, the role of the Depart-ment of Homeland Security (DHS) in safe-guarding surface transportation systems, which are largely owned and operated by state and local entities, primarily involves overseeing, coordinating, and regulating se-curity-related activities. (Surface transpor-tation includes the four general modes of land-based transportation: mass transit, freight rail, highway motor carrier, and pipe-line.) H.R. 5089 would authorize DHS to pur-sue efforts to enhance the security of such systems. Assuming appropriation of the necessary amounts, CBO estimates that implementing H.R. 5089 would cost $21 million over the 2019–2022 period. Enacting the legislation would not affect direct spending or revenues, therefore pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply. CBO estimates that enacting H.R. 5089 would not increase net direct spending or on- budget deficits in any of the four consecutive 10-year periods beginning in 2028. H.R. 5089 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA). 
ESTIMATED COST TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT  The estimated budgetary effect of H.R. 5089 is shown in the following table. The costs of the legislation fall within budget function 400 (transportation).

BASIS OF ESTIMATE  This estimate assumes that H.R. 5089 will be enacted near the start of fiscal year 2019 and that necessary funds will be appro-priated each year. H.R. 5089 would direct DHS to prioritize the assignment of federal officers and intel-ligence analysts to existing fusion centers in jurisdictions where high-risk surface trans-portation systems are located to enhance in-formation sharing about security-related threats. (Fusion centers are state and locally owned facilities that serve as focal points for coordinating the efforts of government agen-cies and other entities involved in law en-forcement and other security-related activi-ties.) The act also would require the depart-ment to establish a framework for operators of transportation facilities to follow in es-tablishing centers to integrate and oversee daily operations and authorize DRS to pro-vide training to nonfederally enforcement agencies. The act does not specify how DHS should prioritize the assignment of its employees, but based on information from the depart-ment about current staffing levels, CBO ex-pects that providing the envisioned level of support to fusion centers would require addi-tional federal personnel. Using information from DHS, CBO estimates that as many as 36 such centers oversee high-risk transpor-tation-related assets. For this estimate, CBO assumes that DRS would deploy one full- time employee (at an average annual cost of about $175,000) to each of those centers. As-suming the department would hire addi-tional staff gradually over the next year, CBO estimates that implementing the legis-lation would cost $3 million in 2019 and $2l million over the next five years. Costs could be higher or lower depending on how many employees DRS determines are necessary to work with the fusion centers and carry out other activities under the act. 
PAY-AS-YOU-GO CONSIDERATIONS  None. 
INCREASE IN LONG -TERM DIRECT SPENDING AND  
DEFICITS  CBO estimates that enacting H.R. 5089 would not increase net direct spending or on- budget deficits in any of the four consecutive 10-year periods beginning in 2028. 
MANDATES  H.R. 5089 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in UMRA.

CELEBRATING THE 50TH ANNIVER-SARY OF THE RESERVE OFFI-CERS ASSOCIATION NATIONAL HEADQUARTERS BUILDING 
HON. JACK BERGMAN 
OF MICHIGAN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, March 29, 2018 Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to congratulate the Reserve Officers Associa-tion of the United States (ROA) on the 50th anniversary celebration of their national head-quarters building in Washington, D.C. On Feb-ruary 22, 1968, the ROA Minuteman Memorial Building officially opened at One Constitution Avenue, NE at the corners of 1st Street and Constitution across the street from the U.S. Capitol Building and the Dirksen Senate Office Building. ROA is a professional association of feder-ally commissioned Reserve and National Guard officers, non-commissioned officers (E5 and above), former officers, and spouses of the uniformed services of the United States to include Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, and Coast Guard, plus the U.S. Public Health Service and the National Oceanic and Atmos-pheric Administration. ROA advocates for ade-quate funding of equipment and training re-quirements, recruiting and retention incentives, and employment rights for all members of the Reserve Components. ROA also advises and educates Congress, the president, and the American people on national security issues. The Association was founded in 1922 when one hundred forty-four officers, most of them combat veterans of World War I, first gathered with General of the Armies John J. ‘‘Black Jack’’ Pershing at the Willard Hotel in Wash-ington, D.C., to formally establish a new orga-nization. During World War II, the Association be-came inactive ‘‘for the duration’’ as its mem-bers went off to war. ROA was reactivated in 1946, and in 1948, Reserve Officers of the Naval Services (RONS) merged with ROA. The Marine Corps joined later the same year, with the Coast Guard entering in 1949. When law created a separate Department of the Air Force, for the first time the nation had, in ROA, a Reserve association embracing all the Services. Public Law 595 of the 81st Congress estab-lished the objective of ROA, to ‘‘support and promote the development and execution of a military policy for the United States that will provide adequate National Defense.’’ Presi-dent Harry S. Truman, one of the early mem-bers of ROA, signed the charter on June 30, 1950. ROA was first headquartered in The Lee House at 1653 Pennsylvania Ave NW from 1924 to 1938. The house, which later became the presidential Blair-Lee House, was conven-iently located directly across the street from what was then called the State-War-Navy Building (now the Eisenhower Executive Office Building) and cater-cornered to the White House. The intervening years between 1938 and 1966 resulted in ROA outgrowing several headquarter ‘‘homes’’ around the capital city. Finally, in early 1966, ROA decided to have a permanent headquarters building and pur-chased three brick boarding houses at 1 Con-stitution Ave NE on Capitol Hill for $314,000 and, thus, began building a permanent na-tional headquarters called the Minuteman Me-morial Building. The architectural firm Mills, Petticord & Mills of Washington, D.C. was asked to proceed with the final plans and specifications for the new ROA headquarters while a major fund-raising campaign began with a $1,500,000 goal to offset the cost of purchasing the land and erecting a new building. The entire project cost ROA $1,610,156, but with the generosity of ROA members and benefactors, no mort-gage was needed in the end. ROA members worldwide were actively in-volved in the concept, design, construction and fundraising of the Minuteman Memorial building, including Lieutenant Commander Alan B. Mills, one of the architects of the new building. So much pride went into the new Minute-man Memorial building that a sign at the con-struction site reminded all passersby that ‘‘The Reserves Care Enough to Share Enough to Keep our Country Free.’’ This legacy con-tinues today with the 821,600 Reserve Com-ponent members who serve daily from every state and in dozens of countries around the globe.

HONORING FIRST CHOICE HEALTH CARE 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, March 29, 2018 Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speak-er, I rise today to honor an organization who has shown what can be done through hard work, dedication and a desire to serve their community, First Choice Health Care. First Choice Health Care has served as a support system to families of Yazoo County. Veronica Starling attended Hinds Nursing Allie Health Center. She was in the first LPN to RN bridge program. Five years later, Star-ling decided to take her career to the next level by becoming a business woman. Starling formed First Choice Health Care through her career as a nurse. First Choice Health Care opened in Yazoo County, Mississippi in 2015. With 52 employees, the local facility provides quality care for loved ones in a home-like at-mosphere. First Choice Home Health can provide serv-ices to all 82 counties within the State of Mis-sissippi. Overall the company employs 218 people and currently provides services in 39 counties. The Yazoo City locations have the largest staff. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing First Choice Home Health for its dedication to serving others and giving back to the community.

RECOGNIZING M CMAHON/RYAN CHILD ADVOCACY CENTER DUR-ING CHILD ABUSE AWARENESS & PREVENTION MONTH 
HON. JOHN KATKO 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, March 29, 2018 Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize April as Child Abuse Awareness & Prevention Month and to honor the tremen-dous work of McMahon/Ryan Child Advocacy Center in Syracuse, New York. According to the Department of Health and Human Services, over 683,000 children were victims of child abuse or neglect in 2015, a number that has held steady for years. Addi-tionally, 1,670 children died from child abuse or neglect in 2015 and according to the Na-tional Child Traumatic Stress Network, the ma-jority of these deaths could have been pre-vented. Since 1983, April has been designated as Child Abuse Awareness & Prevention month. In recent years, the focus of the month on rec-ognition and prevention has expanded to in-clude promoting healthier parenting and strong families. In Central New York, we are incredibly fortu-nate to have McMahon/Ryan Child Advocacy Center as a strong resource. This organization works to prevent child abuse and neglect and to provide care and support for those who have endured abuse. The goal of McMahon/ Ryan is to end child abuse, and to ensure that the community fully understands the impact of abuse. The McMahon/Ryan Child Advocacy Center offers a variety of life-changing programs which work efficiently every day to support vic-tims of Child Abuse, and stop child abuse out-right. Throughout the month of April, McMa-hon/Ryan will recognize Child Abuse Preven-tion Month with its annual ‘‘Go Blue 4 Kids’’ Campaign. In 1989, Bonnie Finney, a grand-mother in Virginia began the blue-ribbon cam-paign as a tribute to her three-year-old grand-son who had died at the hands of abuse. The blue ribbon remains a symbol of childhood abuse and neglect prevention across the United States. Additionally, the blue pinwheel is a national symbol of child abuse and ne-glect prevention. It stands as an uplifting re-minder that all children deserve a happy child-hood and future. Purchasing a pinwheel this month helps McMahon/Ryan contribute to the lives of children directly in our community. I encourage all Central New Yorkers to ‘‘Go Blue’’ during the month of April and to support the work of McMahon/Ryan Child Advocacy Center to help end child abuse. f 
RECOGNIZING THE 39TH ANNIVER-SARY OF THE TAIWAN RELA-TIONS ACT 
HON. ILEANA ROS-LEHTINEN 
OF FLORIDA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, March 29, 2018 Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, April 10, 2018 marks the 39th anniversary of the Tai-wan Relations Act, one of the most important components of U.S. policy toward Taiwan. In addition to President Reagan’s 1982 Six As-surances, the Taiwan Relations Act forms the cornerstone of the U.S.-Taiwan relationship, providing unequivocal guidance for relations with our ally, an ally whose progress has been an inspiration to all those still suffering under repressive governments. Taiwan’s vibrant de-mocracy, open society, and free market are examples to the world of what can be achieved when innovation and human rights are allowed to flourish. They also make Tai-wan a natural partner for the United States, a partnership that has served as an anchor for peace and security in the Western Pacific. As we celebrate the 39th anniversary of this crit-ical law, it is incumbent upon the United States to ensure we are doing everything in our power to ensure the promise of the Tai-wan Relations Act, assisting Taiwan so that she can resist all types of political, economic, and military coercion by the regime in Beijing, and strengthening the already formidable U.S.- Taiwan partnership. The American Institute in Taiwan’s new compound in Taipei’s Neihu district exempli-fies the significant progress being made in the U.S.-Taiwan relationship and our long-term commitment to our ally. Built with American materials and by American workers, the com-pound is a symbol of strong U.S.-Taiwan rela-tions, and made even more powerful by the fact that our lease is for 99 years, a number signifying longevity in Taiwanese culture. With an inaugural ceremony for the new compound to be held on June 12, 2018, I am looking for-ward to visiting as soon as possible and I en-courage all my colleagues to visit and support the U.S.-Taiwan relationship. Signed into law on March 16, 2018, the Tai-wan Travel Act is another illustration of our strong partnership with Taiwan. I was a proud cosponsor of this law which states that it should be U.S. policy to not only allow visits from Taiwanese officials at all levels of gov-ernment, but to encourage and facilitate these visits. It also states that our own policy-mak-ers, including at the highest levels of govern-ment, should visit Taiwan for face-to-face meetings with their counterparts. For too long, administration after administration have caved to Chinese pressure and self-imposed restric-tions in our relations with Taiwan. With the Taiwan Travel Act, the United States is doing the right thing by our friend and ally and taking another step toward taking full advantage of our wonderful partnership. Finally, the U.S.-Taiwan economic relation-ship is very robust as Taiwan is the United States’ eleventh largest trading partner and the United States is Taiwan’s second largest. Taiwan’s free market and importance in global supply chains make it an ideal place for for-eign investment and Americans have recog-nized this fact with the United States becom-ing Taiwan’s largest investor and an important exporter of agricultural goods to Taiwan. We must keep looking for ways to mutually benefit from our growing partnership, including through new trade deals. With the anniversary of the Taiwan Rela-tions Act fast approaching, this is an oppor-tune time to review the U.S.-Taiwan partner-ship and work toward making our relations even stronger, and I am looking forward to working with all my colleagues to see how we can do just that.

HONORING LEON WILSON 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, March 29, 2018 Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speak-er, I rise today to honor a remarkable public servant, Mr. Leon Wilson who is a native of Jackson, MS. He is married to the former Vir-ginia Harris and is the biological father of three children: Malcolm Wilson, Tara Wilson Evans, and Steven Wilson (deceased); and a loving father to Jon Vincent Bell, Karen Bell and Teshia Sawyer. Mr. Wilson received his Bachelor of Science in mathematics from Langston University, Langston, OK and his Masters of Science in mathematics from Jackson State University, Jackson, MS. He did further study at the Uni-versity of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN. Mr. Wilson served as an educator for 30 years at Lanier and Callaway high schools with Jackson Public Schools. In addition to teaching all types of mathematics, he was the football coach, and track and field coach for Lanier High School. During his teaching ca-reer, he never missed an opportunity to talk to teens about making good decisions. He al-ways encouraged them to work hard and would tell them ‘‘be the best at whatever you do.’’ Because of his deep love for children, Leon, after retiring, tutored students who attended Jackson Public Schools and Hinds Community College. During the summer months, he con-tinued to be involved in the lives of youth. He became the director of Grove Park Junior Golf Clinic—a clinic that taught young girls and boys the fundamentals of golfing. He worked with this organization for over 30 years. The only thing he loved as much as helping chil-dren was his Sunday evening golfing games with his friends. After playing 18 holes of golf, his friends and he would go into the club house and would participate in a bible study class. Mr. Wilson has been a member of Central United Methodist Church for 65 years. He has always had a strong belief in God, and loves to discuss the Bible with anyone. During his years at Central, Leon has served in the fol-lowing positions: Member of the Chanel Choir; Member of the Early Morning Glory Choir; Vacation Bible School Teacher; Van Driver; United Methodist Men (Treasurer); Disciple Bible Study (Teacher); Staff/Pastor Parish Relations Committee (Chairperson): 2 terms under Rev. E. L. Henry, 2 terms under Rev. Embra Jackson; Speaker at Early Morning Service; Tutored at Central’s After School Program; Speaker at Brown Elementary Forum. He is loved by many and is known by many names. His students call him ‘‘Chief’’ because he was the person in charge in his room. Ath-letes and some of our church members call him ‘‘Coach.’’ Golfers call him ‘‘Head Pealer’’ because he defeated them most of the time on the golf course. Still others just call him a ‘‘good person’’ because he does whatever he can to help them. Although he answers to all these names, the one that means the most to him is being known as ‘‘one who loves the Lord.’’ Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Mr. Leon Wilson for his dedica-tion to serving. f 
CELEBRATING THE BICENTENNIAL ANNIVERSARY OF THE TOWN OF GHENT, NEW YORK 
HON. JOHN J. FASO 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, March 29, 2018 Mr. FASO. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor the Town of Ghent on the occasion of its bicentennial. On April 3, 1818, Ghent was established as a town in Columbia County, New York through numerous members of The Society of Friends, which includes early settlers such as the Macy, Tripp, and Bunker families. The town of Ghent is situated in the midst of a thriving agriculture population and is the center of considerable trade and the outlet of a large amount of produce. While the settle-ment was small until the advent of the rail-roads, the community’s attention to the devel-opment of infrastructure rapidly made it what it is today. For over 200 years, Ghent has participated in the American story, contributing to our great state and nation. On April 3, 2018, the resi-dents of Ghent will hold a well-deserved cele-bration of its history and accomplishments. In the neighborly and hospitable tradition of Ghent, this bicentennial celebration will reflect the values of this beautiful community, bring-ing families and residents together to com-memorate the town they love and share. I formally thank the Town of Ghent and each of its residents of the past two centuries for their contributions to New York’s 19th dis-trict.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD —Extensions of RemarksE383 March 29, 2018 
I was not always supportive of medical mari-juana. What changed my mind was hearing testimonials from suffering people who had turned to medical marijuana for relief. The choice to use medical cannabis for treatment was often a decision made when all other treatments had failed, when patients and fami-lies alike had lost hope. I have seen families in the throes of grief at their loved ones’ illnesses—including parents who watched their children with epilepsy suffer from daily, debilitating seizures. Every day brought a new heartbreak, until medical can-nabis finally brought patients and families some much-needed relief. For many patients, this was the first relief from their symptoms that they had felt in many years. But while some patients discover medical cannabis after research, many patients do not know, or even consider, that medical mari-juana may help their conditions. AMMPA, the American Medical Marijuana Physicians Association, has been instru-mental—particularly in Florida—in raising pa-tients’ awareness of medical cannabis as a valid treatment option. They have helped many find relief when other treatments had not worked. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the United States Congress, I want to recognize the Board of Di-rectors of the American Medical Marijuana Physicians Association, and to thank them for their good work.

HONORING NORTH SUNFLOWER MEDICAL CENTER 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, March 29, 2018 Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speak-er, I rise today to honor a remarkable organi-zation, North Sunflower Medical Center. North Sunflower is succeeding at a time when many rural hospitals in the U.S. are struggling to survive. It serves as a lifeline in a county where nearly 40 percent of residents are living in poverty and in a state with some of the highest levels of obesity, diabetes and deaths from cardiovascular disease in the na-tion. And it has helped keep the tiny town of Ruleville afloat. It opened eye and dental clin-ics, a gift shop, a diagnostic center and a hos-pice in downtown stores, many of which had been vacant and in disrepair. The 25-bed hos-pital also sponsors fundraisers for the local high school sports teams and supports area colleges and events, including the Great Ruleville Roast & Run in late September. North Sunflower isn’t immune to the prob-lems plaguing its peers. Its costs are going up at a time when its reimbursements aren’t. Medicare, Medicaid and private insurers are cutting their payments and taking longer to send the checks. After years of growth, it may have to rethink some of the services it offers. ‘‘It’s a daily struggle and it’s getting harder,’’ said Billy Marlow, North Sunflower’s executive director who engineered the turnaround. Marlow had no background in health care when, in 2004, he was asked to join the board and help save the hospital. Born at North Sun-flower and raised in the area, he was a real estate developer and farmer. Soon after, he was named board chairman and then interim administrator. It didn’t take long for him to realize North Sunflower had to develop sources of revenue outside the core hospital. One of his first moves was to relocate the health clinic to a more prominent spot along the road and ex-tend the hours. It’s now open from 8 a.m. to midnight every day and treats 3,500 patients a month, up from 120 in 2004. It saves the hos-pital and patients money by absorbing those who show up at the emergency room but don’t need that high a level of care. The clinic is now a profit center, as is the hospice, pharmacy and durable medical equip-ment facility that sells items such as wheel-chairs, back and knee braces, home oxygen equipment and blood sugar monitors. Marlow opened or expanded all of these. Another top priority was renovating the hos-pital itself. The rooms were old, some of the ceilings were crumbling and the technology was outdated. This led both patients and doc-tors to avoid the place. ‘‘When you have a hospital that’s dirty or has a bad image, you can’t recruit,’’ said Marlow, who credits the employees and ad-ministrators for the rejuvenation. To help fund all the changes, Marlow con-verted North Sunflower to a critical access hospital, a federal designation aimed at keep-ing rural providers alive. The shift increased the medical center’s Medicare reimburse-ments. A federal loan and a county bond helped pay for a new surgical unit and the Beacon Wellness Center, which contains a sleep clin-ic, community gym and rehab programs. And Marlow sold the hospital’s home health aide agency, stashing away $2 million in the bank. Marlow also secured some creative financing. He negotiated a deal with GE to provide new X-ray equipment and a CT scanner. And he hired an outside company to overhaul and up-grade the hospital’s rooms and paid off the bill over time. Along with all internal changes, the hospital developed extensive marketing campaigns. Its slogan, Take me to Ruleville, is everywhere— on billboards and bumper stickers, wrapped around its shuttle vans, in TV advertisements and YouTube videos. Area residents have noticed. North Sun-flower received higher than average ratings from patients on a variety of quality measures, according to Medicare’s Hospital Compare profile. Some 83 percent of patients said they would ‘‘definitely recommend’’ the medical center, compared to an average of 70 percent for Mississippi hospitals and 72 percent na-tionwide. Many area residents said they started com-ing to North Sunflower’s clinic when it opened about a decade ago, not realizing it had ex-isted for years before. Now, they travel miles to see doctors there, bypassing closer hos-pitals along the way. Doctors are interested in working at North Sunflower. In recent years, it has added an array of specialists—an orthopedic surgeon, podiatrist, pediatric hematologist, among oth-ers—who visit anywhere from once a month to a few times a week. A licensed social worker now provides adolescent and family coun-seling at the clinic. And its outpatient cardiac rehab unit just received industry accreditation. Attracting and retaining quality staff to prac-tice in the Delta is also a challenge. North Sunflower pays its doctors top dollar—often more than what they’d make in bigger cities— and covers a portion of their medical school loans. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing North Sunflower Medical Center for its dedication to serving and giving back to the community. f 
RECOGNIZING TIMOTHY HOLABIRD 
HON. DOUG LaMALFA 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, March 29, 2018 Mr. L
AMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today, on behalf of myself and Mr. McClintock, to honor the life arid service of Timothy Holabird, a man well known for his dedication to the con-stituents of Northern California. Mr. Holabird served as Mr. M
CCLINTOCK ’s, and later as my, District Representative. Mr. Holabird has been recognized by many of the citizens and leaders in our communities for his contributions while serving as the local Representative to Modoc, Lassen, Plumas, and Sierra Counties. In his capacity, Mr. Holabird worked for the people, finding resolu-tion for the constituent wronged by our federal government. His tenacity to do good by the people, and his endless drive to ensure fed-eral agencies were staying true to their objec-tives and mission, would quickly tire the aver-age person out. But not so for Mr. Holabird. He was always available to hear the local citi-zen’s concerns, walk them through possible solutions, and ready to fight on their behalf. Mr. Holabird also had an in-depth knowl-edge of public lands policy, and a knack for understanding the appropriate role of an agen-cy in relation to state and local needs. With his friendly demeanor, he could get all parties to the table, establish common goals, and en-sure the actual problems were being resolved. One instance that comes to mind, was back in 2012, when four devastating wild fires burned through the District. Mr. Holabird personally bridged the communication gap with agencies attacking the fires and the communities imme-diately threatened, ensuring both homes and lives were saved. He pursued the concerns of local leaders, and addressed the shortfall of resources with federal agencies to the point of his own physical exhaustion. It is with sadness for his loss of life I rise today. Tim was a friend who I will miss dearly. But I will always remember our drives through that amazing, soul-filling back country we are blessed to represent, where Tim knew most all the people, and could recite the history of each community we passed. It was more his-tory than I could remember in one sitting but I loved it, as we all do in sharing his passion for our country and our NorCal home. God bless him and we know he will be missed by many.

IN RECOGNITION OF NATIONAL STOP THE BLEED DAY 
HON. RAUL RUIZ 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, March 29, 2018 Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, as national Stop the Bleed day approaches on March 31, I encour-age my colleagues and friends to get trained on how to control bleeding in a trauma situa-tion to help end preventable deaths. The American College of Surgeons’ Stop the Bleed program offers training to the public on how to control bleeding in an emergency using simple techniques that can be learned by almost ev-eryone, such as direct pressure, bandaging, and even tourniquets. In the United States, traumatic injuries cause the death of more than 180,000 people each year. While tragically some traumas re-sult in near instantaneous death, many others occur in the first few hours or days and they are most often caused by uncontrolled bleed-ing. Traumatic injuries and bleeding can have many root causes including shootings, vehicle crashes, falls, workplace accidents, and nat-ural disasters. As an emergency physician, I have seen these heartbreaking cases time and again. In trauma care we think of the ‘‘Golden Hour,’’ the time during which, if prompt medical atten-tion is provided we have the best chance of saving a life. The Stop the Bleed campaign teaches members of the community how to re-spond to a bleeding emergency, and just as we see with CPR, the earlier the intervention begins, the greater the chance of eliminating preventable death. This is especially important in the moments before the arrival of medical personnel. Please join with me and consider getting trained to Stop the Bleed.

HONORING JOE TROTTER DOCKINS 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, March 29, 2018 Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speak-er, I rise today to honor a remarkable public servant, Mr. Joe Trotter Dockins who was born in Starkville, Mississippi on July 5, 1930 to the late Mr. and Mrs. Mathew and Mary Frances Dockins. He was married to the late Mrs. Odelle D. Dockins for 54 years and from that union they had two children; a son, Metric and a daughter, JoAndrea. At the young age of 5, Mr. Dockins grew up working in his parents’ grocery store that stayed in business thirty seven years. He re-ceived Christ early in life at Griffin United Methodist Church in Starkville, Mississippi. In his younger years, he participated in the Boy Scouts of America in his hometown. Although he never achieved the honor of being an Eagle Scout, his involvement and support in scouting has continued throughout his career. While growing up in Starkville, he received his high school diploma from Oktibbeha Coun-ty Training School, formerly Henderson High School and since integration it is now Hender-son Junior High School. He graduated with honors with a B.S. Degree in Economics from Alcorn College, now known as Alcorn State University in May 1953.

HONORING CHIEF PETER INGVERTSEN 
HON. ELIZABETH H. ESTY 
OF CONNECTICUT  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, March 29, 2018 Ms. ESTY of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Peter N. Ingvertsen upon his retirement after serving as Chief of Police for the Town of Simsbury, Connecticut for the past 18 years. Chief Ingvertsen is a widely known and respected leader in our commu-nity, and his dedication to public service is an inspiration for his fellow law enforcement offi-cers and all of us who pursue a career in the public good. Chief Ingvertsen demonstrated a passion for public service from a young age and began working as a police cadent as a teenager in Farmington. He eventually rose to become Pa-trol Officer, Corporal, Sargent, Lieutenant, and Captain, and, before joining the Simsbury Po-lice Department in 2000, served as Acting Chief for Farmington and as the Town of Suffield’s Chief of Police. Through his long career in law enforcement, Chief Ingvertsen has become a leader not only in Simsbury, but across Connecticut and New England. He has earned certifications from the New England Command Institute and the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s National Academy and holds Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in Public Administration. What’s more, Chief Ingvertsen has also shared his time and talents to support a num-ber of civic causes. He has been a leader in various Police Associations, including as Vice President of the Connecticut Police Chiefs As-sociation, where he advocated for his fellow public servants and worked to strengthen their professional network. Chief Ingvertsen has also supported the Simsbury Lions Club and the Farmington Exchange Club, which do im-portant work in his local towns. Mr. Speaker, Chief Ingvertsen spent his ca-reer working to keep our community safe and providing experienced, wise leadership to our communities. It is proper that we honor him here today, and I extend my best wishes for an enjoyable retirement to Chief Ingvertsen and his family.

INTRODUCTION OF THE NO LEAD IN THE AIR ACT 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, March 29, 2018 Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise to intro-duce the No Lead in the Air Act. Although the House’s Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) reauthorization bill includes my provision en-couraging the use of unleaded aviation gaso-line by January 1, 2023, that bill is still pend-ing. Therefore, I introduce my bill to prohibit the use of lead in aircraft fuel by 2023. Lead exposure can have harmful effects on children as well as adults. Since 1980, the amount of

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD —Extensions of RemarksE385 March 29, 2018 
lead in the air has decreased 89 percent, but while lead gas for automobiles has been banned since 1995, the piston-engine aircraft industry and airports that supply their fuel con-tinue to use leaded aircraft fuel. Without a fed-eral ban, they will continue to do so and put our communities and children at risk. Lead particles from airplane exhaust can fall widely during flight and there may be high concentrations of lead near airports. It is esti-mated that 16 million people live and three million children go to school within a half-mile of airports that sell leaded aircraft fuel called avgas. The health effects of lead in children include behavioral and learning problems, lower IQ, hyperactivity, slowed growth, hearing problems, and anemia. Lead exposure can cause premature births and spontaneous abortions in pregnant women, and adults can suffer from increased blood pressure, de-creased kidney function, and reproductive problems. Seventy-five percent of piston-engined air-craft already operate safely with fuel that does not use lead. However, small airports continue to only sell leaded avgas for these piston-en-gine aircraft. But small airports will have to comply if the federal government bans the use of leaded fuel. The U.S. Environmental Protec-tion Agency (EPA), which implements the Clean Air Act, announced plans in 2010 to phase out leaded aviation fuel, but in the inter-vening six years we still have not seen a pro-posed rule. The FAA has created a task force of government and aviation industry stake-holders to study alternative fuels for piston-en-gine aircraft that would not use lead. With so much evidence of the harmful im-pacts of lead exposure, we can no longer put our communities at risk. My bill would give enough time for a full phase-out of lead in air-craft fuel—five years—by directing the FAA Administrator, in consultation with the EPA Ad-ministrator, to issue regulations prohibiting the use of leaded fuel in aircraft in U.S. airspace beginning January 1, 2023. I urge my colleagues to support this legisla-tion.
