IN CELEBRATION OF THE ASIAN 
AMERICAN HOTEL OWNERS AS-SOCIATION’S 26TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. AMI BERA 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, April 17, 2015 
Mr. BERA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ap-
plaud the success of the Asian American Hotel Owners Association, known as AAHOA. Founded in 1989, AAHOA is the world’s larg-est hotel owners association and the leading voice of hotel owners in the United States. I am proud to count myself and my family as members. 
This year, AAHOA celebrates its 26th anni-
versary in Long Beach, California at its annual convention. AAHOA’s growth and success over the years serves as a testament to the American dream. As first and second genera-tion Indian Americans, AAHOA members and their families immigrated to the United States seeking opportunity. These entrepreneurs found this opportunity in the hotel business, and over a quarter century later, AAHOA members have a profound influence on the hospitality industry. 
AHHOA is comprised of more than 14,000 
small business owners who own nearly 50 percent of all hotels in America, employ more than 600,000 workers, and have an annual payroll of almost $12 billion. AAHOA members are critical to growing the economy, creating jobs, and providing safe, reliable, and afford-able lodging for millions of travelers. And, we in Congress owe it to these small business owners to create an environment where they can grow. 
I’m also honored to recognize AAHOA chair-
man Pratik Patel for his exceptional leadership this past year. A second generation hotelier, Pratik lives in San Antonio, Texas with his wife, Akta, his daughters, Jayna and Misha, and his parents, Ravindra and Lilawatiowns. As the co-founder and principal partner at REM Hospitality, he manages more than a dozen hotel and other real estate properties where he applies the lessons of hard work and perseverance he learned growing up in the hotel industry. 
Since becoming AAHOA chairman, Pratik 
has lead the association to record levels of membership, a unified public policy advocacy program, and unparalleled industry leadership. I am proud to commend Pratik on his accom-plishments and his dynamic leadership in his community and industry. 
I would also like to recognize AAHOA’s offi-
cers, Vice Chairman Jay ‘‘Jimmy’’ Patel, Treasurer Bharat ‘‘Bruce’’ Patel, Secretary Bhavesh B. Patel and President Chip Rogers, along with AAHOA’s 25 past chairmen whose dedication to the organization and the hospi-tality industry have helped to create jobs, pro-mote investment in their local communities, and grow America’s economy. 
I am proud of AAHOA’s growth and look for-
ward to working with them in the future. CELEBRATING THE 36TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE TAIWAN RELA-TIONS ACT 
HON. MIKE BOST 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, April 17, 2015 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I rise to commemo-
rate the 36th anniversary of the enactment of the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA), which was passed by the United States Congress and signed into law on April 10, 1979. The TRA provides a basis for relations between the United States and Taiwan. 36 years later, the TRA remains the foundation of the continuous bilateral relationship between our two coun-tries and represents the United States’ com-mitment to the people on Taiwan. 
Since the enactment of the TRA, Wash-
ington and Taipei have enjoyed a robust part-nership based on the shared values of democ-racy, economic freedom, and rule of law. Since passage of the TRA, Taiwan has flour-ished into a democracy and is well positioned to play an important role economically in the Asia-Pacific, and globally. In 2014, Taiwan be-came our 10th largest trading partner, sur-passing India and Saudi Arabia. The TRA pro-vides the confidence that has allowed Taiwan to govern itself, expand trade with the global marketplace, and engage in productive rela-tions. 
The United States and Taiwan share a com-
mon commitment to freedom, democracy, and a government elected by the people, for the people. As we commemorate the 36th anni-versary of the TRA, I look forward to Taiwan’s continued growth as a trade and security part-ner and celebrate its relationship with the United States.

IN HONOR OF THE ROWAN- 
KANNAPOLIS ABC BOARD AND ROWAN-SALISBURY SCHOOLS 
HON. RICHARD HUDSON 
OF NORTH CAROLINA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, April 17, 2015 
Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
commend the Rowan-Kannapolis ABC and Rowan-Salisbury Schools on educating more than 100,000 students on the dangers of un-derage drinking in middle schools and high schools across Rowan County. 
The Rowan-Kannapolis ABC Board and 
Rowan-Salisbury Schools have worked to-gether for more than a decade encouraging students not to drink underage through a se-ries of assemblies at schools in the region. Since the Rowan-Kannapolis ABC started the program in 2003, their initiative has served as a model for similar programs across the state. 
Over the years, they have partnered with 
former Washington Redskins coach and cur-rent NASCAR team owner Joe Gibbs to bring famous athletes and other notable guest 
speakers to talk with the students and share real-life testimonies of struggles they have faced. 
This year’s assembly series, called ‘‘Game 
Plan for Life,’’ will emphasize that ‘‘decisions equal our destiny.’’ The assembly series will impact about 4,650 students in North Caro-lina’s 8th Congressional District. 
I am proud to commend this program for 
bringing together our community to make a difference in student decision-making regard-ing alcohol. I would also like to commend Mr. Terry Osborne of the Rowan-Kannapolis ABC Board, Rowan County Sheriff Kevin Auten, and Salisbury Police Chief Rory Collins for their continued support of this program.

HONORING ‘‘ARE YOU KIDDING’’ 
SOCK COMPANY 
HON. CARLOS CURBELO 
OF FLORIDA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, April 17, 2015 
Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize a truly innovative set of brothers. Just last month, I met with Brandon and Sebastian Martinez, business-savvy 7- and 9-year-old brothers and students who I have the honor to represent in Congress. They are an example of how one is never too young to follow their dreams. Ever since Se-bastian and Brandon were toddlers they had a fascination with socks. They had collected a variety of colorful, eccentric, and patterned pairs. Their mother, Rachel Martinez, decided to have them design their own. They began in May of 2014 with their small business ‘‘Are You Kidding?’’ and rapidly skyrocketed onto the national stage when they presented their idea to Daymond John, an investor on the hit television show ‘Shark Tank’, and George Stephanopoulos from ‘Good Morning America’. They have sold their socks to many different stores and have donated thousands of dollars of their earnings to the American Cancer Soci-ety. Small businesses like that of the Martinez brothers make up the fabric of our economy. They have demonstrated their commitment to charitable causes and today I would like to recognize them for their leadership and com-mitment to our community.

the Mississippi River in Minnesota’s 2nd Con-
gressional District of which I proudly rep-resent. 
This plant provides 30 percent of electricity 
for Xcel Energy customers in Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wisconsin, and Michi-gan making it an important part of the region’s energy infrastructure. 
However, without Yucca or a comparable 
solution, all fuel generated in its 42 years of operation has been stored on-site. That equates to 2,550 used fuel assemblies and close to 1000 metric tons of nuclear waste sit-ting on an island in the middle of the Mis-sissippi River. 
Mr. Speaker, this is absurd. In 2009, the Administration ended the Yucca 
program without any alternative strategy and after taxpayers already spent 15 billion dollars to ensure the safety and security of the Yucca Mountain site. 
The dereliction by the Administration leaves 
us open to both environmental and national security risks. Minnesotans know too well the threat of home-grown terrorism with recent threats made to the Mall of America. We need a safe and secure site to store our nuclear waste out of the reach of potential terrorists. We need to move forward with Yucca Moun-tain. 
Mr. Speaker, my constituents and all Min-
nesotans deserve better and I join my col-leagues today in urging support for the Yucca Mountain site.

INTRODUCING A RESOLUTION EX-
PRESSING THE SENSE OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES THAT VETERANS DESERVE THE HEALTH AND LIVING STAND-ARDS THEY FOUGHT TO PRO-TECT 
HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS 
OF FLORIDA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, April 17, 2015 
Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to intro-
duce a resolution expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that veterans de-serve the health and living standards they fought to protect. This resolution pays tribute to the vast numbers of men and women who have served our nation in uniform, yet return home from service homeless, some of whom survive war to die on the streets of this coun-try. 
Today, we are completing the two longest 
wars in U.S. history at great sacrifice to many soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines and their families. When these men and women return home they utilize their skills and leadership as wonderful assets in their communities. But for some, there are no homes. 
In the words of one homeless veteran, 
‘‘When we go into the military, we learn self- discipline, and we learn not to ask for any-thing, we learn to get it for ourselves, or just do without it. And we are a proud people, us military veterans. We don’t ask for anything. But it should never be a society that allows 
their veterans to go across the water to pro-tect this country and come back and have to live on the streets. It shouldn’t be that way.’’ 
These courageous Americans have stood 
up in defense of our freedom, and we owe them more than our gratitude—we owe them our firm commitment to ensure that they re-ceive the care and benefits they earned through their service. 
On any given night, nearly 50,000 military 
veterans sleep in homeless shelters or on the streets. Furthermore, approximately 260,000 veterans use homeless shelters or other serv-ices during the course of a year. 
Homeless veterans have become a focal 
point in the broader fight to prevent and end homelessness in America. We may all take pride and comfort in the recent finding that homelessness among veterans has begun to decrease. One of the biggest contributors to the decreased number of homeless veterans has been the increased federal investment in efficient and effective programs. In addition, there has been significant progress, but more must be done. It is time that we recognize these unsung heroes who have returned from service to face hard times and homelessness. 
Mr. Speaker, it is time that we recognize our 
nation’s homeless veterans. I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in supporting this critically important reso-lution.

TO HONOR THE CAREER OF 
CAPTAIN DARRELL BURGESS 
HON. RICHARD HUDSON 
OF NORTH CAROLINA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, April 17, 2015 
Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Stanly County Sheriff Captain Darrell Burgess for his faithful service over the last 40 years to North Carolina’s 8th Congressional District. 
Captain Burgess has served professionally 
with the Stanly County Sheriff’s Office where he moved up in the ranks from an employee of the Communications Division, to a sworn Deputy Sheriff after his completion of Basic Law Enforcement Training, and finally to Cap-tain of Patrol. He has been chosen twice by his peers as the Stanly County Law Enforce-ment Officer of the Year. 
During his time with the Sheriff’s Office, 
Captain Burgess served as one of the first K– 9 officers in Stanly County, where he worked with a bloodhound named Lucky. He holds a certification as a state instructor from the North Carolina Police Work Dog Association, as well as with the North American Police Work Dog Association. Additionally, Captain Burgess volunteers with the North Carolina Canine Emergency Response Team. 
Captain Burgess has dedicated his time to 
Stanly County, both as a volunteer and public servant, since 1970 when he first started working for the North Carolina Department of Agriculture. Captain Burgess was one of the first Emergency Medical Technicians in the 
state, served with the Oakboro Rural Fire De-partment, and volunteered for more than 30 years with the Stanly County Rescue Squad, where he even served as chief. Despite a kid-ney transplant in 2008, Captain Burgess has never slowed down and returned to work and volunteering after only three months. 
Because of his lifetime of service through 
his volunteer work and vocation, Captain Bur-gess was bestowed the ‘‘Order of the Long Leaf Pine’’ award in April 2015, which is the highest civilian honor awarded in North Caro-lina. Our state and local community have greatly benefitted from his servant leadership. 
It is an honor to extend these remarks today 
to congratulate Captain Burgess on his retire-ment and receiving the ‘‘Order of the Long Leaf Pine’’ award.

CELEBRATING THE 36TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE TAIWAN RELA-TIONS ACT 
HON. TED LIEU 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, April 17, 2015 
Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise to note that on April 10—while Congress was out of session—we celebrated the 36th anniversary of the enactment of the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA). As a Taiwan-born Amer-ican immigrant, I take pride in this landmark piece of legislation, which has provided Tai-wan with a great deal of stability and support as it transformed itself into a vibrant democ-racy, advanced economy and civil society. 
The TRA was intended by Congress to en-
dure, continuing the important relationship be-tween close friends and allies. I am heartened by the strengthening of ties that have taken place in recent years, from Taiwan’s admis-sion to the U.S. Visa Waiver Program in 2012, the first visit of a Cabinet-level official since the Clinton Administration in 2014, and Tai-wan’s shift from our 12th-largest trading part-ner in 2013 to our 10th-largest in 2014. 
As Los Angeles County’s fourth largest trad-
ing partner, Taiwan has a unique relationship with my district. With the largest Taiwanese population in the country, it is no coincidence that Los Angeles County is often seen as the international gateway between the United States and Taiwan. 
Taiwan has much to offer the international 
community. It has proven a responsible global citizen by assisting international organizations during humanitarian crises and disasters, from its efforts following the 2011 To ¯hoku earth-
quake and tsunami to its contribution of 100,000 sets of Personal Protective Equip-ment to West Africa last year for use in the fight against Ebola. These acts are emblem-atic of a people with whom we share many values. 
On this occasion of the 36th anniversary of 
the Taiwan Relations Act, I ask my colleagues to join me in offering our greetings and best wishes to the people and leaders of Taiwan.
