IN RECOGNITION OF TEACHER AND 
MUSICIAN WILLIAM D EWITT 
HON. GREGORIO KILILI CAMACHO 
SABLAN 
OF THE NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, July 31, 2015 
Mr. SABLAN. Mr. Speaker, allow me to add 
to the record of the U.S. House of Represent-atives the story Mr. William DeWitt, a teacher, who has brought the art of music in the North-ern Mariana Islands to an unprecedented level of excellence and who has given to thousands of our young people the joy of finding within themselves their own musical talents. 
Mr. William DeWitt first came to the North-
ern Mariana Islands in 1993, beginning his ca-reer in middle and junior high school, teaching a variety of subjects, including band, piano, and choir. He then accepted an offer to teach at Marianas High School and was successful there at reviving its band program. Enthusiasm for instrumental music education began to cre-scendo, and in 2002 Mr. DeWitt was invited to join the faculty of the newly inaugurated Saipan Southern High School, which was de-signed to be a magnet school for students with an interest in the arts and technology. He has now spent thirteen years at Saipan South-ern, helping countless students fulfill their dream to make music and share it with the world. In doing so, Mr. DeWitt and the stu-dents he has guided have created a legacy, the Saipan Southern High School Manta Ray Band, that is certainly one of the greatest sources of pride for the Northern Marianas Public School System and, indeed, for our en-tire community. 
When Mr. DeWitt came to Saipan 22 years 
ago, he could not have known what he would accomplish. Our island community has always teemed with multi-generational musical talent and held a deep love for singing. But band music and its array of instruments—the trum-pet, flute, trombone, and clarinet—were less well known. Mr. DeWitt changed that. 
Mr. DeWitt also oversaw the incorporation of 
a growing diversity of students into our schools using music as a unifying influence and adding the international flavor of this new student body to its musical sensibility. Up to 250 students now participate in some aspect of the Manta Ray Band program at Saipan Southern. They come from many ethnicities and cultures—Chamorro, Carolinian, Palauan, Marshallese, Filipino, Korean, Hawaiian, Japa-nese, Chinese, Indian—and William DeWitt has helped them learn to join together as one, making music. 
Perhaps, this very diversity is key to the 
success and world-wide recognition the Manta Ray Band has achieved under the baton of Mr. DeWitt. Five times in the last seven years the Manta Ray Band has earned the Tumon Bay Music Festival Sweepstakes Award, the most wins by any organization in the festival’s history. The Manta Rays have been invited to and performed at two Olympic Games: Beijing in 2008 and London in 2012. The Band has 
showcased its talents at the Sydney Opera House, Carnegie Hall, Westminster Abbey, and Disneyland. And just last month, at the Los Angeles Musical Festival the Manta Ray Band earned the Gold Award as the highest scoring ensemble in festival competition. 
This Gold Award is something of a fairy-tale 
ending to Mr. DeWitt’s career. His band exe-cuted its performance with a new precision and intensity. His students displayed an infec-tious enthusiasm and rhythmic jaunt that gave their concert an element of variety and versatility no other ensemble could match. But backstage after the event amidst the triumph, while cameras clicked, tears flowed and hugs abounded, as the Manta Rays dealt with the recognition that this pinnacle also marked the end of an era—for Mr. William DeWitt had taken his final bow with the band. 
William DeWitt and his family will now be 
able to spend time with his parents in Cali-fornia, where he will also pursue a post-grad-uate degree. We wish him well. And we will al-ways be grateful to him for the way that he drew from a very small population of students their maximum talent, so inculcating them in the fundamental elements of musicianship that they were able to soar on international stages. 
As significant as what he gave to each indi-
vidual student, we will remember what Mr. Wil-liam DeWitt gave to the larger communities of which we are part: the pride and honor his musicians brought to Saipan Southern High School, to the Public School System, and to the Northern Mariana Islands as a whole. This musical venture he has led became a partner-ship for all of us. Individuals and businesses gladly supported the Manta Ray Band with contributions totaling more than a million dol-lars over the course of the past decade. And, as a community, we should honor William DeWitt’s legacy by continuing to give our young musicians the opportunity to develop, master, and showcase their talents. 
Lastly, we acknowledge, as does Mr. 
DeWitt, his wife Lois and his children Emily, Abigail, and James, who throughout have been his source of inspiration and support. We thank them for allowing their husband and fa-ther to commit so much of his time and energy to the students of Saipan Southern and the Northern Mariana Islands. 
And we thank you, Mr. William DeWitt. May 
the richness of island life always flow in your blood, just as your accomplishments will al-ways be engraved into our island history.

THE MAN WHO WAS LARGER THAN 
LIFE 
HON. J. FRENCH HILL 
OF ARKANSAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, July 31, 2015 
Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, from the beginning 
of his life, Richard ‘‘Dick’’ Bass was a force to be reckoned with. He always strove to be the first and best at whatever he did—whether as 
a student, oilman, rancher, ski resort devel-oper, or mountaineer. 
As a young man of sixteen, he enrolled in 
Yale University, graduating with a B.S. in Ge-ology at the age of twenty. The gregarious spirit and boundless curiosity that prompted him to climb one of Europe’s highest peaks, the Matterhorn, at nineteen, would continue to be both servant and driver throughout his life. 
Shortly after moving back to Texas to join 
the family oil business, Dick began taking reg-ular trips to Colorado to ski. His love for skiing and his fellow outdoor enthusiasts motivated him to seek out involvement in the industry. Shortly after starting these trips, he and his brother purchased stock in a small under-developed area in Eagle County, Colorado, that became the globally famous Town of Vail. The success and increased public interest in Vail led to his co-ownership and development of the Snowbird ski resort in Utah. He and his Snowbird partner, Ted Johnson, traveled across Europe searching for inspiration and in-novation to bring their vision to life. 
His pioneering spirit was not limited to in-
vestments and skiing and hearken back to his younger self’s interest in mountain climbing. He was determined to become the first man to conquer the Seven Summits, the highest mountains in each of the continents, and achieved this monumental undertaking on April 30, 1985. Throughout his life, his mindset was always that of ceaseless perseverance, as exemplified by his three attempts and final summit of Mt. Everest. 
Dick Bass may have passed on to his new-
est adventure at the age of eighty-five, but his entire life serves as a testament to the power of determination and enterprise. Dick was larg-er than life, actively living every second to the fullest and taking on any challenge thrown at him. He left a truly indelible mark on the world, his wife, Alice, his children Dan Bass, Bonnie Smith, Barbara Moroney, Jim Bass, and his thirteen grandchildren. 
I was proud to count Dick Bass as a family 
friend and a source of inspiration to me in my love of the mountains and my business ca-reer. As John Muir said, ‘‘Climb the mountains and get their good tidings’’; Dick, your legacy lives on.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 
REVEREND WILLIE L. HILL 
HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR. 
OF GEORGIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, July 31, 2015 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor an outstanding Man of God who has been a longstanding source of inspi-ration, spiritual guidance, and moral leadership to the people of Southwest Georgia, the Rev-erend Willie L. Hill. Reverend Hill is retiring after 28 years of pastoring the Greater Beallwood Baptist Church in Columbus, Geor-gia. The congregation will be honoring Rev.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E1194 July 31, 2015 
Hill for his leadership at a retirement dinner on 
Saturday, August 15, 2015 at 6:00 p.m. at the Columbus Country Club and at a retirement program on Sunday, August 16, 2015 during the 11:00 a.m. service at the church. 
A native of Columbus, Georgia, Willie L. Hill 
was born to the late Hollis and Dora Hill. He was educated in the public school system of 
Muscogee County. Reverend Hill then served our nation honorably in the United States Army during the Vietnam War. After com-pleting his service, he attended Chattahoo-chee Valley Community College in Phenix City, Alabama, where he earned an associ-ate’s degree, and later attended Troy Univer-sity to complete a bachelor’s degree in Crimi-nology. It was then that Rev. Hill heard God’s call to preach and enrolled in the American Baptist College to study theology. 
Rev. Hill pastored the Greater Beallwood 
Baptist Church for 28 years, faithfully carrying out his vision for the church and leading its members in the fulfillment of a God-first life. In the years after Rev. Hill became pastor, Greater Beallwood expanded greatly, growing from a century-old church that was facing fi-nancial hardship to a spiritual praising center serving almost 350 people weekly. Not only did Rev. Hill’s leadership grow the congrega-tion in number and in spirit, but it also was in-strumental in the building of a new sanctuary that would accommodate the numerous church services and meetings. 
A strong advocate of access to Christian 
education, Rev. Hill founded Children’s Church, a separate training and worship serv-ice for children ages 5 through 12 to grow in their faith. Children’s Church serves as a valu-able resource for members of the Greater Beallwood Baptist Church and has helped chil-dren learn about the word of God in a way that they can relate to and understand. 
Throughout his pastoral career, always 
seeking to improve the craft of Christian min-istry and discipleship, Rev. Hill has served as President of the Inter-Denominational Ministe-rial Alliance for eight years and Vice President for four years. He served as President of the Fourth District Congress of Christian Edu-cation for two years, and he also co-founded the Columbus Ministerial Association. An avid golfer and fierce competitor, Rev. Hill served on the Golf Authority of the Columbus Consoli-dated Government for ten years. 
Jeremiah 3:15 says, ‘‘Then I will give you 
shepherds after my own heart, who will lead you with knowledge and understanding.’’ Rev-erend Willie Hill is one such shepherd and a man of integrity who exudes the genuine prin-ciples and values of Christian discipleship. A charismatic evangelical leader and pioneer, his spiritual zeal is both infectious and highly contagious. 
Rev. Hill is surrounded by the love and sup-
port of his congregation, but also his family— his wife of 52 years, Helen; their two sons, Daren and Brandon; and three beloved grand-children. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me, my wife Vivian, and the more than 730,000 residents of Georgia’s Second Con-gressional District in thanking the Reverend Willie L. Hill for his service to our nation, the Columbus community, the Greater Beallwood Baptist Church, and the Kingdom of God. HONORING DR. R. SCOTT RALLS, 
RETIRING PRESIDENT OF THE NORTH CAROLINA COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM 
HON. DAVID E. PRICE 
OF NORTH CAROLINA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, July 31, 2015 
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize Dr. Scott Ralls, the seventh president of the North Carolina Com-munity College System, who stepped down as president of the system this summer after seven years of service. 
North Carolina’s community college system 
is one of the state’s greatest educational as-sets. It is one of the nation’s largest commu-nity college systems, and its reach is exten-sive, with most North Carolinians residing within 30 miles of one of its 58 colleges. The system serves more than 850,000 individuals annually, with 321,000 students in degree, certificate and curriculum programs and al-most 500,000 students taking continuing edu-cation classes. Some 40 percent of the state’s wage earners today have received some edu-cation or training at a North Carolina commu-nity college in the past 10 years. 
Dr. Ralls was an exemplary president, car-
rying on the fine tradition of leadership of his predecessor, and our former House colleague, Martin Lancaster. Taking the helm in 2008, President Ralls’ tenure began just as the re-cession hit and the state’s unemployment rate began to soar. During the first three years of his presidency, displaced workers flocked to the state’s community colleges; the system’s enrollment grew 28 percent from 2007 to 2010. At the same time, the system weathered a budget crunch, all the while embarking on a strategy to revamp curriculum, improve com-pletion rates, and forge new transfer agree-ments with the state’s university system. 
Even with these challenges, Dr. Ralls 
helped the System obtain international rec-ognition for its efforts to foster economic and workforce development. Ralls’s efforts in-cluded expanding health care programs, re-energizing technical education, strengthening the connection between economic and work-force development, and furthering strong part-nerships between public schools, community colleges and the University of North Carolina System to promote seamless education path-ways. 
President Ralls also focused efforts on im-
proving student success. He was an early champion for early college high schools, and today, North Carolina hosts one-third of all early colleges in the U.S.—the vast majority located on the campuses of community col-leges. In addition, in 2009, under Dr. Ralls’s leadership, the North Carolina Community Col-lege System initiated a comprehensive set of strategic initiatives focused on student suc-cess and program completion entitled SuccessNC, consolidating curriculums into 32 critical growth areas for North Carolina’s econ-omy and providing students with opportunities to earn industry-recognized, stackable creden-tials, resulting in a more competitive work-force. The Brookings Institution and the Rockefeller Foundation recognized this model in describing one of the most ‘‘forward-thinking economy-shifting efforts underway in Amer-ica’s state and metropolitan areas.’’ During his tenure, President Ralls was elect-
ed by national peers to be the President of the National Association of Industry-Specific Train-ing Directors. He also led a state task force responsible for creating policies and proce-dures for the New and Expanding Industry Training Program, which resulted in a 16% re-duction in expenditures and 11% increase in total training projects. Further, he chaired a task force on workplace safety training and generated new policies for administering the NC Worker Training Tax Credit Program. 
Dr. Ralls serves on several national and 
state boards and commissions and is the Chair of the National Council of State Direc-tors of Community Colleges. He has earned a number of awards and honors, including a Certificate of Appreciation from the U.S. De-partment of Commerce (1995), and a Certifi-cate of Appreciation from the NC Rural Pros-perity Task Force (2000). He was also award-ed the 2006 Freedom Fund Award from the Craven County NAACP, and was dubbed a 2007–2008 Impact Business Leader by the Charlotte Business Leader Magazine. 
Prior to serving as the North Carolina Com-
munity College System President, Dr. Ralls was president of Craven Community College in New Bern and Havelock. This makes him only the second former North Carolina com-munity college president to hold the System presidency, and he is leaving to once again assume the presidency of a fine institution, the Northern Virginia Community College (NVCC). While at Craven, he led efforts to support col-lege enrollment growth, while facing significant impacts of military deployment. At Craven, Ralls led in establishing workforce develop-ment programs in targeted industry sectors; helped create Craven Early College; initiated University Connections to foster on-site and on-line degree completion opportunities, and fostered an Undergraduate Engineering Edu-cation partnership with N.C. State College of Engineering. 
Dr. Ralls, a leader of national distinction, is 
also an approachable, collaborative person who has been a delight for me and others to work with personally. He guided North Caro-lina’s community colleges through the eco-nomic downturn and state budget cuts and oversaw a period of remarkable growth. Thanks to his tireless efforts, thousands of North Carolinians have had the opportunity to obtain the education and training they need to realize their full potential. I thank Dr. Ralls for his years of service to the state of North Caro-lina and wish him the very best as he as-sumes the helm at NVCC.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E1195 July 31, 2015 
The goal of the Braddock District Council is 
to promote the civic, community, and general welfare of the citizens of the Braddock District. The Council represents the interests of com-munity associations, facilitates cooperation and coordination between associations, and provides a path of communications between associations and officials or elected represent-atives of the Braddock District. 
I am pleased to join the Braddock District 
Council of Community Associations in recog-nizing the following Recipients of the 2015 Best of Braddock Awards: 
Citizens of the Year: Amy Zydel for her selfless devotion of time 
and talent to foster care children and foster care parents in the Braddock District and all of Fairfax County. She also is a key supporter of ‘‘Let’s Help Kids,’’ a local charity aimed at giv-ing a helping hand to elementary school chil-dren whose parents are suffering financial hardship. 
Duwain Ketch for his many years of working 
with the Kings Park and Burke Centre Librar-ies. He currently serves on the Executive Board of the Fairfax Library Foundation and heads the Foundation’s Scholarship Com-mittee. Mr. Ketch previously has served as a member of the Burke Centre Conservancy Board of Trustees, and he is a member of the Rotary Club of Burke. 
Young Person of the Year: Jonathan 
McCarty—a member of Boy Scout Troop 1115—for his Eagle Scout project. Jonathan led a group of volunteers in completing trail improvements in Accotink Park by digging a ditch next to the trail which will help reduce the amount of standing water on the trail after rainstorms. All of the work was done by hand because it is located in an area of archeo-logical importance. 
Most ‘‘Can-Do’’ Public Employee: Dennis 
Barton of the Fairfax County Park Authority (FCPA) for volunteering to work overtime with Jonathan McCarty to haul away thirteen cubic feet of dirt that was removed when digging a trail ditch. Without his help, the project couldn’t have been completed. 
Club or Organization Making a Difference in 
the Braddock District: Friends of Long Branch Stream Valley. Less than a year old, this group organized itself for the express purpose of improving both environmental and rec-reational opportunities in the Long Branch Stream Valley, a part of the Accotink Water-shed. 
Neighborhood Enhancement or Beautifi-
cation in the Braddock District (2 honorees): 
The Commonwealth Swim Club. When de-
clining membership and tight budgets caused the pool board to cut back on grounds mainte-nance funds, the grounds began to show signs of neglect. James Watkins, a member of the club and a handyman, offered his time and resources to remedy the problems. He re-paired the entrance to the pool, restored the primary storm water runoff channel, installed new lighting, and landscaped and beautified the area leading to the clubhouse. 
Kings Park West Townhouses HOA. When 
Marilyn Stoney’s property began experiencing flooding, she came to the board with a simple request which led to a community-wide storm water management project. Ms. Stoney volun-teered her experience as a program manager to research the problems, develop solutions, solicit bids, oversee the work, and obtain a grant to assist with replanting once construc-tion was completed. A dozen members of the 
community assisted with the planting. 
Special Recognition also is being given to 
the employees of the Fairfax County Park Au-thority who worked with the residents of Olde Forge/Surrey Square to build the new commu-nity playground. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me 
in congratulating these outstanding residents and organizations and also in thanking them for their service to our community. Their ef-
forts and leadership have been a great benefit to the Braddock District and are deserving of our highest praise.

HONORING ALBERT SORANO 
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, July 31, 2015 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, a community is 
only as strong as the commitments of its citi-zens to its success. Albert Sorano has been one of those committed citizens, a true vision-ary in the city of Yonkers. 
Albert was born in the Bronx and became a 
communicant of St. Bartholomew’s Church. A graduate of New York City Schools, Albert served honorably in the United States Military during the War in Vietnam. Following his serv-ice, Albert moved to Yonkers where he be-came one of the most sought after mentors in the city. 
Albert dove into serving the Yonkers com-
munity by assisting and leading in Career training and Job Placement. He excelled as a major Fundraiser and Event Coordinator for non-profit organizations, including organizing a major fundraising effort to benefit the Ursuline Sisters in New Rochelle. The $125,000 raised was used to establish an infirmary for ill and disabled retired Sisters has been a Yonkers resident for close to 40 years. In 2004, Albert became a strong member of the Exchange Club of Yonkers, rising to the position of Presi-dent for three terms from July 2006 to June 2009, and has been on the Board of Directors for many years. 
Albert continued using his gifts to rally the 
community to fundraise for the Child Abuse Prevention Center in White Plains, College Scholarships for Yonkers High School grad-uates, the Yonkers 5th Grade City Wide Spell-ing Bee, and the Freedom Shrine installations in schools, libraries and city facilities with rec-ognition of outstanding private citizens. 
Albert’s greatest commitment however has 
always been serving the young people in the neighborhood, including those individuals that had been at risk or just released from jail. 
This year, the Exchange Club of Yonkers is 
honoring Albert at the club’s annual ‘‘Book of Golden Deeds Gala.’’ He is incredibly deserv-ing of this recognition, and I count myself for-tunate to represent such a fine individual in the Halls of Congress. Congratulations to Al-bert for receiving this wonderful award. COMMEMORATING 50TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF MEDICARE AND MED-ICAID 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, July 31, 2015 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
commemorate the 50th Anniversary of the passage of Medicaid and Medicare, two of the most beneficial and consequential government programs ever launched. 
On July 30, 1965, President Lyndon B. 
Johnson signed Medicare and Medicaid into law as part of the Social Security Act and in the process made good on the commitments made by Presidents Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman, and John Kennedy to provide health security to Ameri-cans in their old age. 
Medicare is a promise kept to those who 
have contributed a lifetime to our nation to enjoy their golden years with peace of mind and the security of reliable, affordable, and high quality healthcare. 
Likewise, Medicaid created a crucial part-
nership between the government and the peo-ple to provide a basic health care safety net for the most vulnerable Americans: children of adults with low incomes, persons with disabil-ities, and the poor. 
Mr. Speaker, half a century later, the legacy 
of these programs have proven how effective and critical government action can be to the life and well-being of our nation’s most vulner-able. 
In 1965, almost half of all Americans aged 
65 and older had no health coverage, living in fear that the colossal healthcare costs would drive them and their families into poverty. 
Today, because of Medicare, over 98% of 
seniors have health insurance, which has led to a five-year increase in life expectancy for those over 65. 
Today, 55 million Americans rely on Medi-
care for health care, ranging from preventive services, hospital visits, lab tests, to critical medical supplies, and prescription drugs. 
It is difficult for some to imagine what 1965 
was really like, when today affordable, acces-sible and available health insurance is a reality for so many people living with disabilities. 
Before Medicaid was enacted children from 
poor families, pregnant women, and low-in-come working Americans were not able to af-ford even the most basic medical care they needed to remain healthy and productive. 
When the legislation was first passed, many 
claimed that Medicaid would not live up to its promise; but today, because of expansion of Medicaid through passage of the Affordable Care Act the program provides comprehensive coverage for over 70 million children, pregnant women, low-income adults, and people living with disabilities. 
Mr. Speaker, it cannot be seriously disputed 
that Medicare and Medicaid have changed our country and made it better. 
In my home state of Texas and in commu-
nities across the country, both programs have significantly changed the lives and improved health outcomes of many Americans over the past century and represent the best of Amer-ican values. 
Unfortunately, Texas has the highest per-
centage of uninsured (27.6%) in the nation,

4% more than Louisiana the next state on the 
list and Texas’ refusal to participate in the Medicaid expansion created by the Affordable Care act puts the poor residents in my state in jeopardy. 
So the 50th anniversary of Medicaid is bit-
tersweet for Texans because while we cele-brate a program that has saved lives, helped people live longer, expanded care to marginalized communities, and reduced dis-parities in access to healthcare, thousands of low income Texans still do not have the peace of mind that comes with access to affordable, quality health care enjoyed by low-income residents of states that have expanded their Medicaid program with funds made possible by the Affordable Care Act. 
In the 18th Congressional District of Texas 
there are 195,400 persons with Medicaid and 74,704 with medical care provided by Medi-care. 
Mr. Speaker, my constituents favor the Af-
fordable Care Act because they understand the insecurity and feeling of helplessness of being uninsured or underinsured. 
Like Medicare and Medicaid, the Affordable 
Care Act, or ‘‘Obamacare,’’ was vehemently opposed and derided by its adversaries, who said it was too costly, would not work, was un-necessary, or would change the character of America for the worse. 
Like the critics of Social Security, Medicare, 
and the G.I. Bill, all of whom are silent now, they are wrong. 
The Affordable Care Act has been an un-
qualified success. 
This historic legislation has extended afford-
able health coverage to tens of millions of Americans, and has helped to bring peace of mind to many of those for whom relief seemed far out of reach. 
The Affordable Care Act was driven by a 
simple premise: that citizens of the most pros-perous nation on earth should not be forced to choose between their health and their financial security. 
Since the passage of the ACA in 2010, the 
number of uninsured Americans has fallen by nearly one-third, or roughly 16 million people. 
These Americans come from all walks of 
life. 
They are women, who can no longer be de-
nied coverage or be force to pay exorbitant amounts for coverage simply because of their sex. 
There are nine million seniors and persons 
with disabilities, who have saved an average of $1,600 on expensive and lifesaving pre-scription medication. 
And they are this country’s most at risk citi-
zens; people who are working hard and strug-gling to make ends meet while living in near- poverty, and who have been covered by Med-icaid expansion in 27 states and the District of Columbia. 
These benefits have been felt across the 
country, especially in my home state of Texas: 
1. 10.7 million individuals with pre-existing 
conditions such as asthma, cancer, or diabe-tes—including up to 1,632,000 children—no longer have to worry about being denied cov-erage or charged higher prices because of their health status or history; 
2. 4.9 million uninsured Texans have new 
health insurance options through Medicaid or private health plans in the ACA Marketplace; and 
3. 5.2 million persons on private insurance 
have gained coverage for at least one free preventive health care service such as a 
mammogram, birth control, or an immunization in 2011 and 2012. 
In addition to the tangible healthcare bene-
fits for millions of families, the ACA has had powerful effects on the financial state of our nation. 
Since the passage of the Affordable Care 
Act, we have extended the solvency of the Medicare Trust fund by more than a decade, and helped save taxpayers $116 billion through new Medicare efficiencies. 
The Department of Health and Human Serv-
ices has estimated that hospitals saved more than $5.7 billion in costs that would have nor-mally gone unpaid by patients without insur-ance. 
Contrary to the claims of the law’s critics, 
private insurance companies have leaped at the opportunity to compete for business among the newly insured, and the healthcare industry has boomed. 
Through all of these successes, however, 
House Republicans remain obsessed with de-stroying this law, and with unraveling the se-curity it provides to millions of Americans. 
Medicare and Medicaid also continue to 
drive innovation and set the standard for cov-erage, quality, and innovation in American healthcare. 
Mr. Speaker, Medicare and Medicaid con-
tinue to play crucial roles in providing equi-table and affordable healthcare, leading inno-vation in payment and delivery reform, car-rying out outreach to the most vulnerable com-munities, and reshaping the delivery of care for the future. 
Because of these programs, more Ameri-
cans have access to affordable, equitable health care today than at any point in our his-tory. 
And I am committed to making sure that 
number will continue to grow. 
On this 50th anniversary of Medicare and 
Medicaid, we should remember that a healthy America is a prosperous America. 
And as we look ahead to the next half cen-
tury, we can celebrate that what was put in place in 1965 has given us the foundation for a healthy and prosperous future for all Ameri-cans.

HONORING BRIGADIER GENERAL 
DAVID T. BUCKALEW 
HON. EVAN H. JENKINS 
OF WEST VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, July 31, 2015 
Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to honor the service of Brigadier General David T. Buckalew of the West Vir-ginia National Guard. General Buckalew has served in the West Virginia Air National Guard for more than 40 years, having enlisted in the Guard’s 130th Airlift Wing in Charleston, West Virginia in December 1971. After completing his education at West Virginia State University and the Academy of Military Science, General Buckalew returned to West Virginia in Decem-ber 1983 to serve as a logistics plans officer for the 130th Airlift Wing. 
General Buckalew continued to serve honor-
ably and was promoted regularly, advancing to the position of Director of Joint Staff in 2011. He has received numerous awards and deco-rations for his service to our country, including 
the distinguished Meritorious Service Medal with two Bronze Oak Leaf Clusters. 
I know the servicemen and women of the 
West Virginia Air National Guard have been inspired by General Buckalew’s character and his commitment to service, and they will miss General Buckalew’s presence and tremendous leadership. However, I am certain that the les-sons and inspiration that he has bestowed on Guardsmen will continue to have a positive impact on their service to our nation and West Virginia. 
General Buckalew is one of West Virginia’s 
finest Mountaineers, and I along with many others wish him well in his retirement. God-speed, General.

RECOGNIZING THE RETIREMENT 
OF TAWNY HAMMOND 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, July 31, 2015 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the distinguished career of my constituent Tawny Hammond and to congratu-late her on her retirement following 26 years of service to Fairfax County and our commu-nity. 
Ms. Hammond began her career with the 
county at the Fairfax County Park Authority (FCPA) in 1989 and served in a variety of roles including management of recreation cen-
ters, a large lakefront park and a historic farm park. Additionally, she was involved in stra-tegic planning and accreditation, and was in-strumental in FCPA being awarded multiple gold medals by the National Recreation and Park Association. During her tenure, she rep-resented Fairfax County Park Authority at re-gional, state and national conferences, pro-viding presentations on community building, revenue generation and innovative program-ming. In recognition of her extraordinary serv-ice to preserving and enhancing the county park system, she received numerous perform-ance and achievement awards, most notably the A. Heath Onthank Award in 2002, which is Fairfax County’s highest honor for its employ-ees. 
Ms. Hammond was named Director of the 
Fairfax County Animal Shelter in 2012. In just three years, she has turned the shelter into a national model for the humane treatment of animals and has made Fairfax one of the top life-saving communities in the nation. The CEO of the Humane Society of the United States proclaimed the shelter to be one of the top 1% of municipal shelters in the nation. Under Director Hammond’s leadership, Fairfax County became the largest jurisdiction in the US with a live release rate of animals above 90%. On her watch, adoptions of shelter pets have nearly doubled, with 2014 seeing the highest number of dogs ever adopted in a sin-gle year (more than 1000). 
Each year, approximately 5,000 animals 
come through the shelter’s doors. Director Hammond implemented policies and programs so that no animals are euthanized for lack of space or other resources and so that all adoptable animals find loving permanent homes. She implemented new programs in-cluding shelter dog play groups and low in-come spay and neuter services, eliminated

breed adoption restrictions, established com-
munity cat rooms, and expanded the trap-neu-ter-retum program, which is now the largest of its type in the Commonwealth of Virginia. She grew the volunteer program to 300 active vol-unteers and 150 foster families, launched the animal shelter Facebook page, which has be-come the County’s most popular Facebook page, and started a partnership with the Fair-fax County Park Authority to offer Scout pro-grams, camps, programs and obedience classes in the shelter training room. She did all this while overseeing the total reconstruc-tion of the shelter. 
For these accomplishments, she received 
the 2014 Leadership Award from the Metro-politan D.C. Council of Governments, the 2014 Compassion Award by the Virginia Federation of Humane Societies, and was recently named to the Board of the Virginia Federation of Hu-mane Societies. Upon her retirement, she was again awarded the A. Heath Onthank Award— the first person to earn this distinction twice. 
Ms. Hammond is also well known for her 
service to the community outside of her job. She lead ‘‘Springfield Days’’ for more than 20 years, helping it grow to one of the County’s largest special events, and served for ten years as president of the Springfield Civic As-sociation where she was credited with making the community group accessible to the dis-abled and successfully tackling tough neigh-borhood issues such as boarding houses and hoarding. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me 
in thanking Tawny Hammond for a lifetime of service to our community and in congratulating her on her retirement. When I was Chairman of the County Board, we often joked when re-tirement announcements like this were made that we should pass an ordinance not allowing such talented and dedicated people to leave public or community service, and I certainly wish that was the case here. I wish Tawny and her family all the best in this next chapter of her life.

IN RECOGNITION OF FIRST AFRI-
CAN BAPTIST CHURCH’S 175TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR. 
OF GEORGIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, July 31, 2015 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, it is 
my honor and pleasure to extend my sincere congratulations to the congregation of First Af-rican Baptist Church in Columbus, Georgia as the church’s membership and leadership cele-brate a remarkable 175 years. The congrega-tion of First African Baptist Church will cele-brate this very significant anniversary with a Jubilee Celebration on Sunday, August 9, 2015 at the church in Columbus, Georgia. 
Tracing its roots back to the antebellum 
South, African Baptist Church was founded by slaves in 1840 in a building on the corner of Third Avenue and Twelfth Street in Columbus, only blocks away from the Chattahoochee River. This building was the sanctuary for-merly used by First Baptist Church, which was established in 1829 as the first church in Co-lumbus. 
Though founded by slaves, First African 
Baptist Church was pastored by white min-isters during its first twenty-two years. Pos-
sessing a spirit of love and acceptance for all of humankind regardless of skin color that was unique in this time period and in this society, the members of the church opened its doors to all in Columbus who felt the call to worship. By 1858, 731 professed believers had been baptized by the church—390 white and 341 black. 
From its inception through 1915, the church 
relocated three times to accommodate its con-gregation that swelled with the development of the City of Columbus. The second location was a frame building located at the corner of St. Clair and Front Street, now known as Elev-enth and Front. In 1881, the Georgia General Assembly gave the land site located at Elev-enth Street and Sixth Avenue to the church, and it was renamed the Six Avenue Baptist Church. This site is now occupied by Golden Foundry and Machine Company. 
The current location is on the corner of Fifth 
Avenue and Ninth Street, where the church was renamed the First African Baptist Church in 1915. Along with the 175th anniversary of the church’s existence, today I celebrate with the congregation of First African Baptist the centennial of the church’s current location. 
Throughout the years, the church would be 
remodeled and renovated several times. With these aesthetic changes came changes to the church mission. Today, under the leadership of Reverend Roderick B. Green, the church continues to grow and change with the vision of holistic transformation and continual im-provement in Christ. 
The story of First African Baptist Church, 
which began as a small group of people wor-shipping 175 years ago and has grown into an expansive and successful church, is truly an inspiring one of the dedication and persever-ance of a faithful congregation of people who put all their love and trust in the Lord. 
Mr. Speaker, today I ask my colleagues to 
join me in paying tribute to First African Bap-tist Church in Columbus, Georgia for their long history of coming together through the good and difficult times to praise and worship our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

COMMEMORATING 125 YEARS OF 
SERVICE OF THE EAST DUNDEE FIRE PROTECTION DISTRICT 
HON. PETER J. ROSKAM 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, July 31, 2015 
Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
recognize the East Dundee Fire Protection District on their 125th anniversary celebration. 
Throughout the year, the community will 
gather to recognize the heroic firefighters and paramedics who have proudly and faithfully served their community. 
In 1890, the department’s first year of serv-
ice, firefighters responded to 25 calls while protecting the residents living in the area. Today, the fire protection district boasts a 2 million dollar budget, responds to over 1,350 calls, and covers over 10,000 residents from the Fox River to the Arboretum in South Bar-rington. 
Throughout their history, the East Dundee 
Fire Department has seen its ranks swell with family members. Max Freeman, the district’s first fire chief, served with his brother Earl in 
the 1950’s and another fire chief, Eugene Rakow, served as chief until 1986, when his son Mark took his place until late 2009. 
The thirty men and women of the East Dun-
dee Fire Protection District risk their lives daily to protect the surrounding community. Their bravery and courage are deserving of our rec-ognition and admiration. 
Please join me in celebrating this special 
occasion and the long years of service and commitment that it represents.

DECLARATION FOR ONE UNITED 
KOREA 
HON. MICHAEL M. HONDA 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, July 31, 2015 
Mr. HONDA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
submit a declaration for one united Korea as established by the organization One Dream One Korea. 
On this 70th anniversary of the liberation 
and the division of Korea, we, the people and friends of Korea, declare that: 
Korean unification is inevitable. We are 
one people in one land who have shared a common history and culture for millennia. Reunification of the Korean Peninsula is a profound aspiration in the hearts of the Ko-rean people, and a national destiny that su-persede 70 years of separation and all dif-ferences of ideology and government sys-tems. 
Korean unification is desirable. The suf-
fering of people in North Korea and the con-tinuing anguish of separated families cry out for a concerted response from the civilized world. Nuclear threats destabilize the secu-rity of Northeast Asia in particular and the world in general. Meanwhile the people of South Korea seek a pathway to transcend materialism and dysfunctional political di-vides. Building One Korea offers a funda-mental solution to all these problems and will advance peace and prosperity in North-east Asia to the benefit of the world at large. 
Korean unification is now achievable. In 
the past century Korea endured colonization and then division, at the hands of more pow-erful nations. Today, for the first time in modern history, Korean people possess the political and economic power to determine their own future, together with growing global support for the establishment of One Korea. We are at a historic crossroads. Set against the enormous challenges of ending the division and creating a new nation, we have an opportunity to achieve a true great-ness that history rarely accords to any peo-ple. Now is the time to build a national con-sensus for a shared vision of One Korea on the foundation of Korean identity and a com-mon destiny and to garner international sup-port for it. 
The Korean people share one dream: To 
live in One Korea we can all be proud of. Since time immemorial, the Korean people have longed for a model country; one guided by universal principles, shared moral values, and the rule of law, guaranteeing the basic human rights and freedoms endowed to all people by the Creator, as the foundation for a just and prosperous society. In realizing such a model, One Korea will become a strong, sovereign nation that acts as a peacemaker, committed to resolving conflict in Northeast Asia and the wider world. It will be a 2lst century leader as a compas-sionate, humane nation acting with concern

for posterity, and as a responsible steward of 
the earth. 
One Korea will benefit all and threaten 
none. Korea has never invaded another coun-try in its entire history. The love of peace lies deep in our heritage. Therefore, One Korea will foster new guiding principles for peace in the 21st century through inte-grating the values of East and West, and soften the sharp edges of global power con-frontations. One Korea will offer a powerful example, especially for developing nations, of a traditional society that has advanced by embracing the positive aspects of modernity while seeking to retain the enduring values of the past. 
For Korea, those values are expressed in 
the principle of Hong-Ik Ingan: Living for the benefit of all humanity. Since the very origin of Korea, it has been embedded in the hearts, minds, customs, and traditions of the Korean people. It offers a broad, guiding phi-losophy for One Korea where ‘‘Hong-Ik De-mocracy’’ will offer a 21st Century model of government of the people, by the people, and for the people. 
Inspired by this vision of One Korea we, 
the undersigned, submit the following pro-posals for adoption and support by ALL: 
We encourage initiatives to awaken under-
standing of the principles that have shaped Korea’s distinctive heritage in order to strengthen national and international re-solve to bring about One Korea. 
We support efforts to start and sustain co- 
prosperity projects to build infrastructure that allows ordinary people in North Korea to improve their living standards through their own efforts. We advocate people-to-peo-ple contact through cultural exchanges, joint service projects and other initiatives that can rebuild connections between Kore-ans of north and south. 
We call on our brethren in North Korea to 
embrace the program for co-prosperity so that both South and North can cooperate to improve the lives of ordinary people. Let us prosper together, thus building a bridge to-wards peaceful unification when the people themselves can decide how they wish to gov-ern themselves. 
We urge the eight million Korean people 
living outside of the Korean Peninsula to dedicate themselves to the global movement toward One Korea and call on Korean com-patriots abroad to mobilize the substantive support of their adopted lands. 
We appeal to the governments and people 
of all nations, and in particular the United States, the People’s Republic of China, Japan, Russia, and Mongolia, to actively co- operate in advancing Korean unification as the key to the joint security and mutual prosperity of all the nations of the Northeast Asia region and the Pacific rim. 
We call for multi-national entities, such as 
the United Nations, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the Asian In-frastructure Investment Bank, the World Health Organization, and international non- governmental organizations, to provide ad-vice and assistance especially during the challenging transitional period to assure the success of One Korea. 
Therefore, at this historic juncture, we do 
solemnly declare that the Korean people shall be, justly and by right, one family, one people, and one nation. We will work to-gether to realize the dream of One Korea, fulfilling, our historical destiny, and estab-lishing a shining example for generations to come. RECOGNIZING THE 75TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE FAIRFAX COUNTY POLICE DEPARTMENT 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, July 31, 2015 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to rec-
ognize the 75th Anniversary of the Fairfax County Police Department (FCPD) and to thank its officers and staff for their service to our community. 
The Department’s roots actually date back 
to the 1920s when a small group of officers was assembled to handle the then perceived growing traffic problems in Fairfax County, which then had a population of about 22,000 people. By 1940, the county population had nearly doubled to 44,000. The need for an independent police force had become clear and a small department comprised of just 6 of-ficers was established. 
Today, Fairfax County, with a population of 
about 1.2 million people, is the safest jurisdic-tion of its size in the United States. In fact, the total number of serious crimes against people and property committed in the county is actu-ally lower today than it was in 1970 when FCPD began tracking statistics even though the population has more than doubled since then. Remarkably, FCPD has achieved this level of safety with the lowest officer-to-com-munity-member ratio for a jurisdiction of its size and has lost only six officers in the line of duty in 75 years. 
FCPD accomplishes this success through 
strong relationships with the community, other county agencies, and its counterparts in other jurisdictions. I enjoyed a strong relationship with the department during my 14 years on the Board of Supervisors, particularly during my five years as chairman, and that partner-ship continues with my service in the U.S. Congress. 
Community engagement is a particularly 
high priority for FCPD. Officers are visible in our schools and mentor our youth. They meet with local business owners and coordinate with neighborhood watch programs. They meet with local minority communities and faith groups to foster better understanding and co-operation. Moreover, the Chief’s Council on Diversity Recruitment strives to ensure that the diversity of the force reflects that of the community. 
Almost every year since 1995, I have ridden 
alongside the Chief or another police officer to National Night Out events throughout Fairfax County and it is inspiring to see the depth of community support for our law enforcement of-ficers. This is a tribute to the level of passion and commitment displayed by the Department to their mission and our residents. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me 
in congratulating the Fairfax County Police De-partment on its 75th anniversary and in thank-ing the men and women of the Fairfax County Police Department who have made Fairfax County the safest jurisdiction of its size in the United States. This accomplishment certainly contributes to the County being rated as one of the best communities in the nation in which to live, work, and raise a family. HONORING JACKIE BORCHEW 
HON. ROBERT J. DOLD 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, July 31, 2015 
Mr. DOLD. Mr. Speaker, I am honored 
today to recognize Jackie Borchew for her tire-less efforts and dedication to Orphans of the Storm, an animal shelter in Riverwoods, Illi-nois. In her many years of service, she has helped find countless permanent homes for abandoned dogs and cats. 
Jackie’s years of enthusiastic service to Or-
phans of the Storm has most assuredly con-tributed to raising awareness of the shelter and the good work they do to benefit the ani-mal community. Jackie has helped Orphans pursue their mission of saving, caring for and adopting out dogs and cats into loving perma-nent homes. Through off-site adoption events and other countless volunteer efforts, Jackie has been essential to establishing Orphans as a staple for the animal community throughout the region. 
There will most certainly be a hole left be-
hind as Jackie leaves Orphans to embark on her next endeavor. Although she will be missed, all of her efforts have created a strong foundation for the shelter to continue to place abandoned pets into loving homes. I feel per-sonally privileged to have Jackie as a member of our community, and I look forward to seeing what the next stage of her life brings.

Friday, July 31, 2015 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to rec-
ognize the 50th Anniversary of the Rotary Club of Annandale and to thank its members for their service to our community. 
The world’s first service club, the Rotary 
Club of Chicago was formed February 23, 1905, by Paul P. Harris. The name ‘‘Rotary’’ is derived from the early practice of rotating meetings among members’ offices. The Rotary Club concept thrived in its early years, and by 1921 there were chapters on six continents. In 1922, the name ‘‘Rotary International’’ was adopted. The objective of Rotary International is to encourage and foster community service. International understanding, goodwill, and peace are promoted through the shared com-mitment to service of Rotarians from around the world. Rotary International now boasts more than 1.2 million members in 166 coun-tries, and I am pleased to be counted among their honorary ranks. 
Chartered in 1965, the Rotary Club of An-
nandale is an integral part of the community and engages in numerous public service ac-tivities. The Club supports various local com-munity service organizations that provide day care facilities, housing for the homeless, lit-eracy classes, and summer camps for low in-come families, through financial donations and volunteer work programs. In addition, the Club is very committed to supporting educational programs, including the support of student

service organizations at Annandale High

The Club also presents Rotary Medals to the outstanding graduate at each of the elementary, middle, and high schools in the greater Annandale area. 
Rotary International is renowned for its 
worldwide humanitarian projects. The Annan-dale Rotary Club embraces this philosophy and has sponsored projects in other countries, including efforts to and equip a school in Haiti. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me 
in congratulating the Rotary Club of Annan-dale on its 50th Anniversary and thanking its members, volunteers, and supporters for put-ting service above self.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, July 31, 2015 
Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
recognize the Carpentersville Fire Department on their centennial anniversary celebration. 
On September 19th, the community will 
gather to recognize the heroic firefighters and paramedics who have proudly and faithfully served the families and businesses of Carpentersville and the surrounding area. 
In October of 1914, an ordinance was cre-
ated by the village of Carpentersville to estab-lish a volunteer fire department and on Feb-ruary 23rd, 1915 the Carpentersville Fire De-partment assembled for its first meeting in the village hall. A long cry from the one call it re-ceived in 1915, the Carpentersville Fire De-partment responded to 3,518 calls in 2014. However, their mission to protect the quality of life of those they serve has been the same since its founding. 
The men and women who comprise the 
Carpentersville Fire Department risk their lives daily to protect their communities. Their brav-ery and courage deserve of our recognition. 
Please join me in celebrating this special 
occasion and the long years of service and commitment that it represents.

RECOGNIZING MR. ANTONIO 
CAMPOS 
HON. DAVID G. VALADAO 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, July 31, 2015 
Mr. VALADAO. Mr. Speaker, I, along with 
Congressman N UNES and Congressman 
COSTA , rise today to congratulate Antonio 
‘‘Tony’’ Campos for receiving the 2015 Ag One Community Salute. 
Mr. Campos was born and raised in 
Orondritz, Spain. At the age of seventeen, Mr. Campos immigrated to the United States. Al-though he was originally a sheepherder, he began farming Vineyards near Caruthers, Cali-fornia in collaboration with his brothers, Esteban and Fermin, four years after arriving 
in America. In 1971, they began growing al-monds and launched Campos Brothers Farms. 
Throughout his life, Mr. Campos has been 
an active leader in the agricultural community and the Central Valley as a whole. He has served on the Almond Board of California, the Raisin Bargaining Association, the Raisin Ad-ministrative Committee, the National Farmers Organization, the California Bean Advisory Board, and the Fresno County Farm Bureau. Additionally, Mr. Campos has made a point of supporting charitable organizations throughout our community, such as Ag One, Valley Chil-dren’s Hospital, Catholic Charities Diocese of Fresno, Basque Cultural Center, Caruthers High School, and Jordan College. 
Today, Mr. Campos lives on the farm he es-
tablished when he first came to America with his wife, Juliet, and their three children, Jean-nine, Joseph, and Steven. Through their dedi-cation, hard work, and commitment to family values, Campos Brothers Farms has grown to be an industry leader in almond production and processing. 
On Friday, July 31, 2015, Ag One will honor 
Mr. Campos as the 2015 Community Salute for his success as a local almond farmer and his commitment to serving his community. 
Mr. Speaker, we ask our colleagues in the 
United States House of Representatives to join us in commending Antonio Campos for successfully pursuing the American Dream and congratulating him for being recognized as the 2015 Community Salute.

HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA

Friday, July 31, 2015 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to rec-

The world’s first service club, the Rotary 
Club of Chicago was formed February 23, 1905, by Paul P. Harris. The name ‘‘Rotary’’ is derived from the early practice of rotating meetings among members’ offices. The Rotary Club concept thrived in its early years and by 1921 there were chapters on six continents. In 1922, the name ‘‘Rotary International’’ was adopted.

Rotary International now boasts more than 1.2 million members and Clubs exist in 166 countries located on six different continents. And I am pleased to be counted among their honorary ranks. 
The Vienna Club was chartered June 30, 
1965. Shortly thereafter, the Club sponsored a circus as its very first fundraiser. The event raised $1,000 towards the construction of the Vienna Community Center. Since then, the Club has engaged in a wide variety of activi-ties that have benefitted the community. 
In the early years, the Club offered several 
different scholarships to local students, pro-vided career counseling, organized CPR train-ing, and engaged in several service projects. 
Today, the Rotary Club of Vienna is perhaps best known for hosting the annual ViVa Vi-enna Festival every Memorial Day Weekend. This event attracts thousands of people from throughout the region and is a great source of pride for the Vienna community. Perhaps more importantly, the most recent festival raised ap-proximately $160,000 that the Club will donate to dozens of organizations locally and through-out the world. 
The efforts and effectiveness of the Vienna 
Rotary Club have been recognized with Rotary International awards for best club, vocational service, literacy programs, international serv-ice, membership, best all-round club, best small club bulletin, community service, and outstanding club. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me 
in congratulating the Rotary Club of Vienna on its 50th Anniversary and thanking its mem-bers, volunteers and supporters for putting service above self.

TRIBUTE TO YOUNG STAFF MEM-

HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, July 31, 2015 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as Mem-
bers of Congress we know well, perhaps bet-ter than most, how blessed our nation is to have in reserve such exceptional young men and women who will go on to become leaders in their local communities, states, and the na-tion in the areas of business, education, gov-ernment, philanthropy, the arts and culture, and the military.

We know this because we see them and 
benefit from their contributions every day. Many of them work for us in our offices as jun-ior staff members, congressional fellows, or in-terns and they do amazing work for and on behalf of the constituents we are privileged to represent. 
Mr. Speaker, I believe there is no higher 
calling than the call to serve a cause larger than ourselves. That is why I ran for public of-fice. I was inspired to serve by President Ken-nedy who said, ‘‘Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country,’’ and by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. who said: 
Everybody can be great because anybody 
can serve. . . . You only need a heart full of grace. A soul generated by love. 
By this measure, there are several other 
great young men and women who served as volunteers this year in my offices. They may toil in obscurity but their contributions to the constituents we serve are deeply appreciated. That is why today I rise to pay tribute to eight extraordinary young persons for their service to my constituents in the 18th Congressional District of Texas and to the American people. They are: 
Christopher Lange from the University of 
California at Berkeley and the United States Air Force; 
Earl King from North Carolina Central 
School of Law; 
BerThaddaeus Bailey from the University of 
Oklahoma; 
Jesse Guadiana from the University of 
Texas; 
Ashley Melero from Texas Tech University; Cassie Gianni from the University of Hous-
ton and the LBJ School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas; 
Aisha Yaqoob of the University of Georgia; Aaron Richards of St. John’s University; and Asad Moten from Harvard University and 
the F. Edward He ´bert School of Medicine at 
the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences. 
Mr. Speaker, the energy, intelligence, and 
idealism these wonderful young people brought to my office and those interning in the offices of my colleagues help keep our democ-racy vibrant. The insights, skills, and knowl-edge of the governmental process they gain from their experiences will last a lifetime and prove invaluable to them as they go about making their mark in this world. 
Because of persons like them the future of 
our country is bright and its best days lie ahead. I wish them all well. 
Mr. Speaker, I am grateful that such 
thoughtful committed young men and women can be found working in my office, those of my colleagues, and in every community in America. Their good works will keep America great, good, and forever young.

CONGRATULATING THE ROBERT E. 
SIMON JR. CHILDREN’S CENTER ON THE OCCASION OF ITS 25TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, July 31, 2015 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to con-
gratulate the Robert E. Simon Jr. Children’s Center on the occasion of its 25th Anniversary and its relocation to a new facility. 
The education and well-being of our children 
are among the highest priorities that we as a community share. The Robert E. Simon Jr. Children’s Center provides a safe, nurturing, instructional atmosphere that promotes cre-ativity, curiosity, independence, and coopera-tion. 
The Simon Center is a nonprofit organiza-
tion located in the 11th Congressional District in Reston, Virginia, and named after Mr. Rob-ert E. Simon, the founder of Reston. The Cen-ter was founded in 1990 as part of the Reston Area Child Care Consortium. The consortium was made up of employers, community resi-dents, parents, educators, and professionals concerned about child care needs in our com-munity. The Simon Center fulfilled Mr. Simon’s original vision for providing quality childcare in his master plan for Reston. 
Mr. Simon’s original plan placed the Center 
adjacent to an elder care facility to add an ‘‘inter-generational’’ component. That feature was part of the Center’s original space as it was connected to a rehabilitation center and a close walk to an assisted-living facility. For 24 years, this arrangement flourished and both the children and the senior citizens in the neighborhood benefitted greatly. 
The Simon Center is dedicated to meeting 
the emotional, social, physical, and intellectual needs of children aged three months to five years in a safe, child-oriented environment. Since 2000, the Center has held an advanced accreditation by the National Academy of Early Childhood Programs, a division of The National Association for the Education of Young Children. The Simon Center prides itself on helping 
children grow through the exploration of their environment and the community. Its caring and highly qualified staff, low teacher turnover, parent-run board of directors, and low chil-dren-to-staff nursery ratios create a stable, nurturing environment for our children. The Center provides families greater flexibility with a year-round program and convenient hours with minimal closings. 
The benefits of quality early education pro-
grams are indisputable. The Center for Public Education has conducted extensive research into both the short term and long term effects of Pre-K educational programs. In every measurable area including kindergarten readi-ness, high school graduation rates, test scores at various points throughout elementary and high school, average income at age 40, even in home ownership rates, children who had participated in Pre-K programs fared much better than their counterparts who did not. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join 
me in congratulating the Robert E. Simon, Jr. Children’s Center on the occasion of its 25th Anniversary and commending its staff and supporters for their unwavering devotion to our children.

RECOGNIZING MR. ALEX 
SANCHEZ’S LIFETIME OF SERVICE 
HON. MICHAEL M. HONDA 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, July 31, 2015 
Mr. HONDA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize Mr. Alex Sanchez, a public servant and long standing friend who most recently re-tired as Executive Director of the Housing Au-thority of the County of Santa Clara. It is my great pleasure to commend Mr. Sanchez for his lifelong commitment and dedication to pro-viding affordable housing opportunities for Californians. The reach of his legacy has gone even further, as he has also tirelessly and very effectively advocated for the development and promotion of national housing policies to serve all Americans in need. 
I have had the honor of working with Mr. 
Sanchez for over a quarter of a century to pro-mote housing policies at the State and federal level to assist lower income households in Sil-icon Valley. The task has been incredibly daunting, given that we serve the most expen-
sive region in the country. 
I first met Mr. Sanchez in 1988, when I was 
asked to join the American Leadership Forum (ALF) as a representative of the educational sector. ALF/Silicon Valley was just forming and a group of local leaders were asked to serve as Class I, which included nearly 30 in-dividuals representing business and local gov-ernments, educational institutions and non- profits. 
At the time, I worked for a local school dis-
trict and also served on a Board of Education for a different school district. Mr. Sanchez had just been named Director of Housing for the City of San Jose. He and I spent many months together and discussed our visions and plans for bettering our community. 
One of the most significant moments was to 
take a two week trip with the ALF group to Colorado Springs, Colorado to discuss the value of community and the need to work to-gether. During this two-week period, we be-came very close and ultimately helped each

other to climb the 8,000 feet to the top of 
Pike’s Peak. 
Mr. Sanchez met his biggest challenge . . . 
to meet the San Jose Mayor’s and City Coun-cil’s goals to produce thousands of units of af-fordable housing. Through our time with ALF and the opportunity to work with each other, I was able to witness Alex’s selfless and coura-geous drive to promote policies and design programs to increase the supply of affordable housing. 
It has been a great privilege to have shared 
a friendship and working partnership with Alex Sanchez over the years. I commend him for his 27 years of distinguished service with the City of San Jose Housing Department and the Housing Authority of the County of Santa Clara. Alex has greatly improved the lives of thousands of people and I thank him for his years of dedicated service to Silicon Valley. 
His work has been recognized through his 
leadership positions in a number of national and state housing policy organizations. He is a founder of the California Housing Consor-tium, and served as a member of the Housing Leadership Council of the Silicon Valley Lead-ership Group. Most recently, he was appointed by Governor Jerry Brown to Chair the Cali-fornia Housing Partnership Corporation. 
Mr. Sanchez’s exemplary leadership will be 
greatly missed. I rise today to wish him my very deepest congratulations for his excep-tional level of commitment to public service across various California communities, includ-ing the City of Bell Gardens and the City of Santa Ana. I extend him my greatest personal wishes for health and happiness throughout his very well-earned retirement.

There are over 72,000 clinical nurse special-

These critical health care providers identify and implement best practices, which reduce health care costs. The expertise of clinical nurse specialists will be crucial as our nation’s population continues to age and de-mand for health care grows. 
The National Association of Clinical Nurse 
Specialists represents this important profes-sion nationally. I would like to congratulate the association on celebrating their 20th anniver-sary this year. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me

RECOGNIZING THE PASSING OF 
ALFRED W. BLUMROSEN 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, July 31, 2015 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise to ask the 
House of Representatives to join me in hon-oring Alfred W. Blumrosen, Thomas A. Cowan Professor of Law Emeritus, Rutgers School of Law Law School, who died this month, for his pioneering work in the development of the na-tion’s equal opportunity laws and for his fron-tier role in the shaping of the Equal Employ-ment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), which celebrated its 50th year of operation on July 2, 2015. 
The nation is fortunate that Professor 
Blumrosen’s dedication to equal rights led him to choose a brand new field of law, equal em-ployment law, to which to devote his brilliant mind. When Professor Blumrosen was born, in 1928, there were no laws requiring equal treatment in the United States. His legacy is work that was instrumental in laying the groundwork for modern anti-discrimination law. Professor Blumrosen inspired generations of 
law students at Rutgers School of Law for al-most 50 years. As a public intellectual, his steady stream of publications in discrimination and labor law, were matched by his work on the ground helping to put new anti-discrimina-tion laws in action. Blumrosen’s work in both these worlds was cited just last month in a dissent in a housing discrimination case, 
Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs v. Inclusive Communities Project, by Justice Clarence Thomas, who gave Professor Blumrosen credit for the development of dis-parate-impact theory, the most powerful tool used in equal opportunity legal work. 
‘‘Alfred Blumrosen, one of the principal cre-
ators of disparate-impact liability at EEOC, re-jected what he described as a ‘‘defeatist view of Title VII’’ that saw the statute as a ‘‘com-promise’’ with a limited scope. A. Blumrosen, Black Employment and the Law 57–58 (1971). Blumrosen ‘‘felt that most of the problems con-fronting the EEOC could be solved by creative interpretation of Title VII which would be upheld by the courts, partly out of deference to the administrators. . . . EEOC’s guidelines from those years are a case study in Blumrosen’s ‘creative interpretation.’ Although EEOC lacked substantive rulemaking authority it repeatedly issued guidelines on the subject of disparate impact.’’ . . . EEOC’s strategy paid off. The Court embraced EEOC’s theory of disparate impact, concluding that the agen-cy’s position was ‘‘entitled to great deference.’’ See Griggs 401 U.S., at 433–434. 
Professor Blumrosen began his leadership 
in developing anti-discrimination law and the EEOC itself as soon as Title VII, the employ-ment equal rights section of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, was enacted. He was the EEOC’s first chief of conciliations, where early Title VII law was often made by securing negotiated agreements with employers. He was director of federal-state relations, guiding state and local anti-discrimination agencies in applying this burgeoning new area of law. Although Blumrosen’s work in anti-discrimination law was particularly prominent at the EEOC, his work with other agencies was also important, particularly with the Office of Federal Contract Compliance, including his research with that agency to show that so-called reverse dis-crimination was uncommon in affirmative ac-tion cases. He served as special attorney in the Civil Rights Division of U.S. Department of Justice. Blumrosen was always generous in lending his brilliant mind to develop equal em-ployment law—as counsel to Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays and Handler, a New York law firm, and as counsel to the National Associa-tion for the Advancement of Colored People, among others. 
Mr. Speaker, when I chaired the EEOC, 
Professor Blumrosen was a principal advisor on much of my most important work. He was particularly instrumental in helping us develop our guidelines on Employee Selection Proce-dures as well as our affirmative action guide-lines to motivate employers to correct discrimi-natory patterns before they led to liability. Al was on the front lines with me in the total reor-ganization of EEOC operations nationwide to eliminate its huge backlog while significantly increasing remedies for complainants using negotiated agreements. 
Notwithstanding his groundbreaking law de-
velopment work in the public sector, Professor Blumrosen remained a prolific scholar, whose efforts in the field often informed his scholar-
ship. For his essay ‘‘Six Conditions for Mean-ingful Self-Regulation’’, he received the Ross Prize from the American Bar Association. 
I was fortunate to write the introduction to 
one of his books, coauthored by his late wife, the late Ruth Gerber Blumrosen, Slave Nation: How Slavery United the Colonies and Sparked the American Revolution. Ruth Blumrosen, a professor of business and an adjunct pro-fessor of law at Rutgers, often collaborated with her husband. Together, they were a for-midable team of scholars. Not surprisingly, their work in the law also infected their two sons, Steven and Alexander, who are both at-torneys and legal scholars. 
Mr. Speaker, Alfred Blumrosen spent his 
professional life as a leader on the develop-ment of equal opportunity law and in bringing equality to the workplace. It is rare that a law-yer or a professor has been able to be so in-fluential simultaneously in law development and in implementation of one of the nation’s most important laws. 
Alfred Blumrosen was fortunate to live to 
see the 50th anniversary of Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 50th anniversary of the opening of the EEOC itself just this past July 2. A fair share of both of these com-memorations belongs to Professor Blumrosen. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask the House of Represent-
atives to join me in honoring Alfred K. Blumrosen for a lifetime of productive trail-blazing work that was instrumental in the cre-ation of equal opportunity law, in the invention of the Equal Employment Opportunity Com-mission, and in sparking scholarship in a new field of American law.

While serving as the special assistant for Signals Intelligence and Information Operations, Naval Network War-fare Command, he led the Navy’s expansion of its operational role in cyberspace. Mr. Streufert also served with the State Depart-ment where he served as Chief Information Security Officer before transferring to DHS and assuming the position of Director of the FNR, which he held for more than three years. 
Mr. Streufert is well known in government 
and industry as the ‘‘brains and energy’’ be-
hind the government’s move to secure and continuously monitor the federal information technology network, which was a revolutionary approach he developed while with USAID and State. Upon joining DHS, he cultivated this ap-proach into a strategy for government-wide cy-bersecurity acquisitions that leveraged the ad-vantages of volume purchasing and thereby reducing taxpayer cost. This program, now known as Continuous Diagnostics and Mitiga-tion (CDM), enhances the cybersecurity of net-works and systems across the government by enabling vulnerabilities to be identified and mitigated more quickly. 
In addition to being an innovative tech-
nologist and industry trailblazer, Mr. Streufert is known for being a true leader and mentor. His empowerment and mentorship of his fed-eral colleagues and staff will serve as his leg-acy as those employees become the next generation of our nation’s leaders, due largely to his example and guidance. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me 
in congratulating Mr. John Streufert on his re-tirement and in thanking him for his 34 years of distinguished service to the people of the United States of America. His accomplish-ments, innovation, and leadership have con-tributed greatly to our nation and are worthy of our highest praise. COMMEMORATING 100 YEARS OF

TRIBUTE TO ANNA TERESA 
NARVA ´EZ BOU 
HON. NYDIA M. VELA´ZQUEZ 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, July 31, 2015 
Ms. VELA ´ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
on behalf of Anna Teresa Narva ´ez Bou in 
celebration of her 100th birthday. She was born in Corozal, Puerto Rico on July 26, 1915. She married Ramon Narva ´ez Ferrer and had 
two children, Ramond Luis Narva ´ez Bou and 
Carmen Lourdes Narva ´ez Bou. 
Don˜a Teresa, as she is affectionately 
known, came to New York in 1952 during the great migration from Puerto Rico to the States. The Great Depression of the 1930s and the impact of World War II in the 1940s on the is-land doubly effected poverty and the prospect of employment for many Puerto Ricans. This combined with the launch of commercial air travel influenced her and her family to come to New York. She settled at 25 McKibbin Street in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. A few years later they were displaced due to the city’s urban re-newal development project in the area. Hous-
ing discrimination patterns and the language barrier resulted in further displacement for the family in the years that followed. 
In spite of the challenges faced by living in 
a new city and learning a new language and culture, Don ˜a Teresa persevered. She earned 
her living working at a factory and lived her life, then and now, selflessly with honor and pride. She raised her children and instilled the values of integrity, fairness, service, faith and community. Her determination motivated her to triumph during difficult times. Her experi-ences compelled her to advocate for safe, de-cent and affordable housing for the growing Puerto Rican community in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. 
Today, Don ˜a Teresa continues to exemplify 
a love for her family and friends. She is proud of her children and grandchildren who embody a life of service whether in the community or serving the nation. Her sense of humor, gen-erosity, and perseverance has served her well for 100 years. 
Mr. Speaker, it is women like Don ˜a Teresa 
that embody the heart of our great nation as well as the spirit of the proud Puerto Rican woman and mother who dreamed of a better life for her family and community. 
Therefore, I join with the residents of the en-
tire 7th Congressional District of New York in wishing Anna Teresa Narva ´ez-Bou a very 
happy 100th birthday.

HONORING THE 2015 LITERACY 
COUNCIL OF NORTHERN VIR-GINIA AWARD RECIPIENTS 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, July 31, 2015 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate the recipients of the 2015 Lit-erary Council of Northern Virginia Community Partner Awards and Volunteer of the Year Awards. Founded in 1962, the Literary Council of Northern Virginia (LCNV) is a non-profit educational organization that recruits and trains volunteers to teach adults who need help reading, writing, speaking, and under-standing the English language. 
The mission of LCNV is to empower adults 
by providing a wide range of programs that teach the basic literacy skills needed in order to become self-sufficient and full participants in society. These programs include Basic Adult Literacy Tutoring, which works with adults who speak and understand English but 
are beginning readers and writers, and ESOL tutoring programs that teach reading, writing, listening comprehension, and speaking to those in our community for whom English is not their native language. In addition, LCNV offers two classroom programs: The ESOL Learning Center program, which serves low-in-come immigrant adults and teaches life skills important in the work place and community, and Family Learning Programs, which teach English proficiency to parents while their chil-dren participate in separate literacy-related ac-tivities. 
Over more than 50 years, thousands of peo-
ple and families have gained new knowledge through LCNV programs. This would not have been possible without the dedication and com-mitment of the many volunteers and commu-nity partners. It is my great honor to recognize
