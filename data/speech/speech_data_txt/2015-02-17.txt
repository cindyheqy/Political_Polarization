THE REPUBLICANS’ WAR ON 
IMMIGRANTS 
HON. DINA TITUS 
OF NEVADA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Tuesday, February 17, 2015 
Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, last week I visited 
with two constituents, Aida and Norma, who have lived and worked in this country for years, rearing their families here and paying taxes. I also saw my former student Blanca after she met with President Obama to talk about the positive impact the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program has had on her life. Like Aida and Norma, Blanca is a long time resident of Southern Nevada and an active member of our community; she holds a degree from UNLV and is planning to attend law school. 
Thanks to the Deferred Action for Parental 
Accountability (DAPA) program, Aida and Nor-ma’s families no longer live in constant fear of separation. And because of DACA, Blanca can continue to pursue her American Dream without the threat of deportation. 
But unfortunately, Republicans are waging a 
war against immigrants. They are actively working to repeal DACA and DAPA and strip away these critical protections for DREAMers and their families. They refuse to consider comprehensive immigration reform. They are wasting time suing the President for taking ex-ecutive action to prevent the separation of families. And they are jeopardizing national security by tying anti-immigrant riders to the DHS funding bill. 
By refusing to work with House Democrats 
to find a long-term, comprehensive fix to our broken immigration system, Republicans are 
turning their backs on women like Aida, Norma, and Blanca. They are keeping people in the shadows and costing our economy over $800 billion. They’d rather attack families than terrorists. 
I urge Republicans to immediately stop wag-
ing their morally indefensible, economically foolish, and physically dangerous war on un-documented families, listen to the American people, and immediately pass the immigration reform we need.

HONORING THE LIFE AND MED-
ICAL CONTRIBUTIONS OF DR. JOHN SHEA, JR. 
HON. STEVE COHEN 
OF TENNESSEE  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Tuesday, February 17, 2015 
Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life and medical contributions of re-nowned surgeon, innovator and ‘‘father of mid-
dle-ear surgery,’’ Memphian Dr. John Shea, Jr. A graduate of the University of Notre Dame and Harvard Medical School, Dr. Shea served in the Korean War before returning to Mem-phis and taking over his father’s medical prac-tice in 1952. Two years later, he traveled to Vienna, Austria where he began extensive re-search into otosclerosis that would lead to his inventing the world’s first prosthetic stapes— the tiny stirrup-shaped bone in the middle ear—and performing the groundbreaking stapedectomy procedure, which has since been used by doctors world-wide. 
While in Vienna, he read German manu-
scripts on otosclerosis, which is a condition of the inner ear that causes calcification of the stapes and is considered a leading cause of deafness. Although the medical community ended surgical attempts to address this condi-tion 50 years earlier, Dr. Shea had a vision to combat this cause of deafness in middle-aged adults by replacing the calcified bone with a prosthetic. While many of his colleagues ques-tioned the procedure as dangerous, Dr. Shea was convinced through his research that the revolutionary surgery would work. On May 1, 1956, he successfully performed the first stapedectomy and went on to repeat the pro-cedure nearly 50,000 times during his career before retiring in 2011. 
In addition to inventing the prosthetic stapes 
and developing the stapedectomy, Dr. Shea contributed to otology surgical instruments in-cluding drills and microscopes, and intratympanic perfusion treatment for Meniere’s disease or spontaneous vertigo. His ingenuity earned him a spot on the London Times list of ‘‘1,000 Makers of the Twentieth Century’’ and a 1962 featured cover article in LIFE magazine as one of five people who were recognized as part of ‘‘The Takeover Generation.’’ In 2013, he donated 406 papers, including over 300 published articles, docu-menting his life’s work to the local Memphis Public Library’s Memphis Room. Dr. Shea be-longed to more than 50 scientific societies, and was a clinical professor in the otolaryn-gology departments of the University of Ten-nessee, the University of Mississippi, the Uni-versity of North Carolina and Tulane Univer-sity. Additionally, he received honorary doctor-ates from Memphis schools Christian Brothers University and Rhodes College, and an hon-orary fellowship from the Australian and English Royal College of Surgeons. 
My father, Dr. Morris D. Cohen, knew Dr. 
Shea and his father as he, too, was a physi-cian and operated the Children’s Clinic at 1155 Madison, down the street from Dr. Shea, Sr.’s Ear Nose and Throat Hospital. He told me about the hospital and spoke admiringly of Dr. Shea and his father. Memphis has long been home to many great medical institutions, 
including Campbell Clinic, the University of Tennessee Health Science Center, the Elvis Presley Trauma Center at Regional One Health (formerly The Med) and the Shea Ear Clinic. Many Memphis physicians have re-ceived national acclaim but none have been more renowned than Dr. John Shea, Jr., 
In 1985, Dr. Shea opened the Shea Ear 
Clinic at Poplar and Ridgeway in Memphis where his son, Dr. Paul Shea continues the family practice today. Dr. Shea, Jr. was a pio-neer in the field of otology and a legendary doctor who helped usher in a new era of treat-ment. He came from one family of physicians and leaves behind another. Memphis will miss John Shea, Jr., and I send my condolences to his wife Lynda Lee Mead; sons Paul and Dr. John Shea III (private practice otologist); daughters Susanna Shea and Wendy Canarios; seven grandchildren and three great grandchildren; and his friends and loved ones. I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the life and medical contributions of Dr. John Shea, Jr. His was a life well-lived.

HONORING SANDRA COLLINS 
HON. DAVID G. REICHERT 
OF WASHINGTON  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Tuesday, February 17, 2015 
Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Speaker, today, I wish 
to honor an extraordinary woman who testified before the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources while I was chairman. San-dra Collins, from my home state of Wash-ington, has seen a lot in her life. She dealt with domestic violence, addiction, homeless-ness, separation from her children, and de-pression. She didn’t let any of this stop her. 
With the help of the WorkFirst Community 
Jobs Program and Goodwill, she turned her life around. Now, not only is Sandra clean, employed, and reunited with her children, she is succeeding beyond her own expectations. On February 19th, a new Goodwill Outlet Store will open in Olympia, WA. Sandra will be its manager. The new store brings jobs and hundreds of thousands of dollars to the local economy—and when local economies are thriving, so is our national economy. 
I could not be more proud of Sandra and 
what she has achieved. I am honored to have met her and am so pleased that her testimony will help shape future legislation. I congratu-late her today, on her success and her hard work. She is an example for all.
