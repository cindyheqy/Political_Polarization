Background PROSPECTUS-LEASE 
U.S. INTERNATIONAL TRADE COMMISSION WASHINGTON, 
DC PBS 
Prospectus Number PDC-03-WA16 
lTC is an independent, quasi-judicial Federal agency with broad investigative responsibilities 
on matters of trade. The agency investigates the effects of dumped and 
subsidized imports on domestic industries and conducts global safeguard investigations. The Commission also adjudicates cases involving imports that 
infiinge on intellectual property rights. Through such proceedings, the agency facilitates a rules-based international trading 
system. lTC also serves as a Federal resource where trade data and 
other trade policy-related information is gathered and analyzed. The infonnation and 
analysis is provided to the President. the Office of the United States Trade Representative 
(USTR) and Congress to facilitate the development of sound and infonned U.S. trade policy. 
lTC makes most of its infonnation and analysis available to the public to promote understanding 
of international trade issues. 
Justific:ation 
lTC is currently housed at 500 E Street, SW, in Washington, DC. The current lease 
expires on August 10, 2017, and lTC requires continued housing for 517 personnel 
cunently working in this location to carry out its mission. The current lease includes a Public 
Courtroom Complex including a Main Hearing Room and three courtrooms. This Complex provides the necessary space 
for hearing claims of unfair tmde from domestic industries 
and adjudicating patent infringement and intellectual property claims brought 
by intellectual property owners. 
GSA will consider whether ITC's continued housing needs should be satisfied in the 
existing location based on an analysis of other potential locations within the delineated 
area. If other potential locations are identified, a cost-benefit analysis will be conducted 
to detennine whether the Government can expect to recover the relocation and 
duplication costs of the real and personal property needed for lTC to accomplish its 
mission. The future lease will maintain ITC's existing office and overall utilization rates. 
Summary of Energy Compliance 
GSA will incorporate energy efficiency requirements into the Request for Lease 
Proposals and other documents related to the procurement of space based on the approved prospectus. 
GSA encourages offerors to exceed minimum requirements set 
forth in the procurement and to achieve an Energy Star performance rating of 75 or higher.

Justification 
The existing U.S. Courthouse, constructed in 1929, does not meet the U.S. Courts Design Guide standards, does not provide for future expansion, and lacks adequate security. The existing prisoner sallyport and secured elevator provide access to 
only 
half of the courtrooms. Due to lack of available space in the U.S. Courthouse, several court functions and court-related agencies currently occupy space in the leased Courthouse Annex. The District court and Bankruptcy court operations are 
split 
between the two buildings, also causing a split of U.S. Marshals Service operations. 
In addition, secured parking is only available in the leased Courthouse Annex, across a parking lot from 
the U.S. Courthouse. 
The new courthouse will allow for co-location of court operations, separate circulation for the public, judges, 
and prisoners, thereby improving security as well as efficiency 
of court operations. Relocation of agencies from leased space to the new courthouse 
will result in savings of approximately $1,795,000 in future annual lease payments to the private sector.

Summary of Energy Compliance 
This project will be designed to confom1 to requirements of the Facilities Standards for the 
Public Buildings Service and will implement strategies to meet the Guiding 
Principles for High Performance and Sustainable Buildings. GSA encourages design opportunities to increase energy 
and water efficiency above the minimum 
performance criteria. 
Future of Existing Federal Building! 
The Federal tenancy in Des Moines does not support the need for t\\'O courthouses: 
therefore, GSA will explore alternatives associated with the disposal of the existing courthouse. 
Some of these alternatives include donation or exchange.

Justification 
The existing U.S. Courthouse, constructed in 1966, does not meet the. United States 
Courts Design Guide standards, and lacks adequate security. The existing building configuration cannot provide secure travel for judges without traveling into common hallways. Due to lack 
of suitable expansion space in the Federal building, several courtrooms have been constructed with columns within the courtrooms, which blocks views 
of portions of some courtrooms. The new courthouse 
will provide for a single location of court operations and separate circulation 
for the public, judges, and prisoners, thereby improving security as well as efficiency 
of court operations.

FY 2016 Proled Summary 
The General Services Administration (GSA} proposes design and construction of an 
annex of approximately 46,000 gross square feet, including 25 inside parking spaces, and 
repair and alteration of the Tomochichi Federal Building and Courthouse (FB..cT) at 125 
Bull Street in Savannah, GA. The project will meet the lO.year space needs of the court 
and court-related agencies, and the structure/site will allow for expansion to meet the 
anticipated 30-year needs of the court. The Judiciary's Courthouse Project Priorities list 
(approved by the Judicial Conference of the United States on September 17, 2015) 
includes a courthouse project in Savannah, GA. 
Through Public Law I I 1-I 17 (FY 20 J 0), Congress appropriated $7,900,000 for re-design 
of a new courthouse in Savannah to house the long-term needs of the U.S. District Court. 
GSA; in collaboration with the court, has determined that alteration of the Tomochichi 
FB-CT, in conjunction with the construction of a new courthouse annex, can meet the 
space requirements of the district and bankruptcy courts with the application of the 
Judiciary's courtroom sharing policies and allowing for the continued occupation of the 
historic Tomochichi FB-CT.

NEW U.S. COURTHOUSE ANNEX 
ALTERATION- TOMOCHICHI FEDERAL BUILDING & COURTHOUSE 
SAV ANNAB, GA 
Overview of Prolect Prospectus Nwnber: PGA-CTC-SA16 
Congressional District: 1 
The 1899 Tomochichi FB-CT building is listed in the National Register of Historic 
Places. The building consists of four courtrooms (two district, one magistrate, and one 
bankruptcy). The major tenants in the building are the U.S. District and Bankruptcy 
Courts. GSA will modernize the Tomochichi FB-CT in conjunction with the construction 
of a new courthouse annex to meet the Judiciary's current and anticipated long-term 
needs in Savannah. 
The proposed project includes demolishing two federally owned buildings in GSA's 
portfolio (Juliette Gordon Low Federal Buildings A & B), which are located on a site 
adjacent to the Tomochichi FB-CT, and new construction of the courthouse annex on the 
site of the demolished buildings. The new courthouse annex will include space for one 
bankruptcy courtroom and chambers, a Bankruptcy Clerk, and the U.S. Probation Office. 
Renovation of the Tomochichi FB-CT wi!l include interior construction for buildout of 
tenant space for court and related agencies, and common area finishes. In addition, the 
renovation will address several critical building needs, focusing on replacement or 
refurbishment of the building's major systems, including: plumbing; electrical; heating, 
ventilating, and air conditioning (HV AC); elevator; and fire protection systems, which all 
require extensive replacement or refurbishment due to their age and lack of energy 
efficiency. The project will also offer the opportunity to prepare vacant space for 
backfill with agencies currently in leased locations. 
The new courthouse annex and renovated Tomochichi FB-CT will together provide four 
courtrooms and five chambers consistent with the application of courtroom sharing policies 
and limitation on the provision of space for projected judgeships. When 
complete, the new annex and renovation of the Tomochichi FB-CT will provide for the 
I 0-year space requirements, and the structures/site will allow for expansion to meet the 
anticipated 30-ycar needs of the U.S. District and Bankruptcy Courts in Savannah.

SAVANNAH,GA 
Justification Prospectus Number: PGA-CTC-SA16 Congressional District: 
1 
The existing Tomochichi FB-cr is unable to meet the cwrent and future requirements of 
the Judiciary. The current space and building infrastructure do not meet today's standards 
for security, operational functionality, accessibility, or environmental efficiency. 
The courthouse does not have secure circulation for judges or separate 
circulation for the public and prisoners. In addition, the building's systems are beyond 
their useful Jives, do not comply with firellife safety standards, and do not meet the 
Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standards. 
Due to the age of the Tomochichi FB-CT, upgrades or replacement of major building 
systems, including plumbing. HVAC, electrical, and life safety, are needed to enable continued operation 
for the courts and to address energy efficiency. The addition of the 
annex will meet the lang-term space needs of the courts, while also addressing the current 
security and circulation deficiencies. 
Previously approved prospectuses for Savannah included construction of a larger new 
courthouse. Application of the Judiciary's courtroom sharing policies, limitation on the 
provision of space for projected judgeships, and continued use of the historic Tomochichi 
FB..cT, detennined that the court's housing requirements ean be accomplished in a smaller 
project. Together, the new annex and renovation of the Tomochichi FB-CT will 
improve security, create discrete circulation patterns, provide for future growth, and co­
locate the court operations.

The General Services Administration (GSA) proposes the acquisition of a site, and the design and construction 
of a new U.S. Courthouse of approximately 62,000 gross square feet, including I 7 inside parking spaces, 
in Greenville, MS. GSA will design and construct the courthouse to meet the 1 
0-year space needs of the court and court-related agencies, and the site 
will also accommodate the anticipated 30-year needs of the court, which indicate no anticipated growth.

The courts and related agencies currently occupy space in the historic Federal Building­
United States Post Office Courthouse (FB-PO-CT) in downtown Greenville. The existing building, built in I959, is shared by the Judiciary, Department 
of Justice, Postal 
Service, and Social Security Administration. The new courthouse will provide two courtrooms and three chambers consistent with the application 
of courtroom sharing policies and limitation on the provision 
of space for projected judgeships. The site for the new courthouse is still 
to be determined.

The existing FB-PO-CT, constructed in 1959, does not meet the United States Courts Design Guide standards and lacks adequate security. Although building technology and security have evolved significantly since the building's original design and construction, only minimal upgrades have been made to the building. Most 
of the building's systems are at the end 
of their useful lives, and need complete replacement to operate efficiently and meet existing life safety and building codes.

Backgroun«;t 
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is currently located in an approximately 
308,000 RSF leased location at 1650 Arch Street, Philadelphia, PA. This primarily office space serves 
as a Regional office for the EPA. The lease expires May 31, 2018. and a 
long-term housing solution is needed for the agency. This prospectus request seeks 
authority to procure a long-lenn leasing solution for this requirement. 
Acquisition Strategy GSA 
is planning to satisfy this requirement through a single award solicitation. All offers must provide space consistent with the 
delineated area defined by this prospectus. 
Justification 
EPA has developed a program of requirements for replacement space to house its Region 3 Regional Headquarters in 
Philadelphia, PA. The proposed requirements utilize new space standards developed to improve space efficiency 
and employee productivity and 
will reduce EPA's footprint by 85,847 RSF. In the absence of this reduction, the status 
quo cost of continued occupancy at the proposed market rental rate would be 
S II ,698, J 86 per year. 
Summary of Energy Compliance GSA 
will incorporate energy efficiency requirements into the Request for Lease 
Proposals and other documents related to the procurement of space based on the approved 
prospectus. GSA encourages offerors to exceed minimum requirements set forth in the procurement and to achieve 
an energy Star performance rating of 75 or 
higher .

DC PBS 
Prospectus Number: POC-10-WA17 
Background 
The PBGC mission is to protect the retirement incomes of more than 40 million American 
workers in more than 26,000 private-sector defined benefit pension plans. 
PBGC was created by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) of 1974 to encourage 
the continuation and maintenance of private-sector defined benefit pension 
plans, provide timely and uninterrupted payment of pension benefits, and keep pension insurance premiums 
at a minimum; 
Justification 
PBGC maintains three headquarter leases located at 1200 K Street NW, 1275 K Street 
NW, and 1225 I Street NW, in Washington, DC. These leases are cotenninous, expiring December 
2018. The PBGC has a continuing need for headquarters office and support space 
to fulfill its mission. Consolidating the three existing leases will streamline 
operations and improve PBGC's footprint by 35,360 RSF. Without this reduction, the status-quo cost 
of continued occupancy would be $23.358,000. 
Summary of Energy Compliance 
GSA will incorporate energy efficiency requirements into the Request for Lease 
Proposals and other documents related to the procurement of space based on the' 
approved prospectus. GSA encourages offerors to exceed minimum requirements set 
forth in the procurement and to achieve an Energy Star perfonnance rating of 75 or 
higher. 
Resolutions of Approval 
Resolutions adopted by the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and 
the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works approving this prospectus will 
constitute approval to make appropriations to lease space in a facility that will yield the required rentable 
area. 
Interim Leasing 
GSA will execute such interim leasing actions as are necessary to ensure continued housing 
of the tenant agency prior to the effective date of the new lease. It is in the best interest ofthe Government 
to avert the financial risk of holdover tenancy.

Background Congressional District: 4 $6,791,189 (Leases effective 05110/1993 and 06/15/2004) 
The original 320,825 RSF building, 116 Lake View, was constructed in 1993 to meet the 
space requirements of the Department of the Navy, and it was used as a warehouse and 
torpedo testing facility. In 2004, the United States Joint Forces Command (USJFCOM) 
was the sole tenant when it expanded the facility by 82,912 RSF with the construction of 
116B Lake View, which is connected to 116 Lake View as one structure. Upon the disestablishment 
of USJFCOM in August 2011, DOD-JS became the sole occupant and 
has a continuing need for housing to carry out its mission. 
GSA will consider whether DOD-JS's continued housing needs should be satisfied in the 
existing location based on an analysis of other potential locations within the delineated 
area. If other potential locations are identified, a cost-benefit analysis will be conducted 
to detennine whether the Government can expect to recover the relocation and duplication costs 
of real and personal property needed for DOD-JS to accomplish its mission. 
Justification 
The Joint Staff is currently housed at J 16 & 1168 Lake View Parkway. GSA executed 
the original lease in 1993 and a five-year renewal option effective on May 9t 2013. There 
are no remaining lease renewal or purchase options. A purchase option will be solicited 
in the proposed lease procurement. The existing building functions as a training center 
and DOD-JS has a continuing need for space to carry out its mission. 
Summary of Energy Compliance 
GSA will incorporate energy efficiency requirements into the Request for Lease 
Proposals and other documents related to the procurement of space based on the 
approved prospectus. GSA encourages offerors to exceed minimum requirements set 
forth in the procurement and to achieve an energy Star performance rating of 75 or 
higher.

EOIR and OPLA are currently.co-located.at 100 Montgomery Street in San Francisco, CA under a lease that 
expires on October 12, 2016. In conjunction with approximately 9,000 RSF in a 
nearby Federal building, this location acts as one of the 59 EOIR Courts around the country. The 
judges and staff administer and interpret Federal immigration 1aw and regulations through immigration 
court proceedings, appellate reviews, and administrative hearings. 
On March 16,2016, GSA awarded a 10 year lease for approximately 84,300 rentable square feet 
which will become effective immediately following the existing lease expirations on October 12, 
2016. The original prospectus proposed to decrease OPLA's requirement by approximately 
6,800 rentable square feet. OPLA is in the process of hiring 37 additional personnel not anticipated in 
the original prospectus to support the growing docket in the San Francisco EOIR 
Court and these personnel are anticipated to be onboard by July 2016. The existing space, 
removed from the previous prospectus is needed to meet this requirement This prospectus decreases the 
requested approved rental rate per rentable square foot from $76.00 to $75.00, increases 
the estimated maximum rentable square feet from 85.000 to 91,100, and improves 
OPLA's overall utilization rate from 239 usable square feet (USF) per person to 210 USF per 
person. 
Summary of Energy Compliance 
GSA wilt incorporate energy efficiency requirements into the Request for Lease Proposals and other documents related 
to the procurement of space based on the approved prospectus. GSA 
encourages offerors to exceed minimum requirements set forth in the procurement and to achieve 
an Energy Star performance rating of75 or higher. 
Resolutions of Approval 
Resolutions adopted by the House Committee on Transportation and Intiastructure and the Senate Committee 
on Environment and Public Works approving this prospectus will constitute 
approval to make appropriations to lease space in a facility that will yield the required rentable 
area.

Acquisition Strategy $5,647,558 $3,211,969 (Lease effective 8/15/1997) 
The NARA-FRC is currently located in subterranean space. In order to maximize competition, 
GSA will consider aboveground and subterranean space for this procurement and will relocate the agency 
if economically advantageous to the Federal Government. 
Justification 
NARA-FRC is one of 18 Federal Records Centers across the nation used by Federal agencies for records-related services. The FRCs work together to provide temporary and permanent record storage services. The facility storage services are full at this location and any new incoming client boxes are accommodated 
by moving existing records to other Federal Records Centers 
or by the disposal of eligible records. The current location provides storage conditions that meet pennanent 
or archival requirements, which accounts for 57 percent 
of permanent record storage. NARA-FRC requires space to accommodate the movement, processing, and retrieving 
of 
large quantities of client record boxes into its computer systems, along with the ability to store client records in an environment that meets regulations for Federal Records Storage (36 CFR 1234). The movement 
of client record boxes is accommodated using eight-foot carts, which require ample circulation space for maneuvering. Although Federal agencies are attempting to convert to electronic storage, the demand for paper record storage still remains and since 
2000 has grown by 2.38 percent per year. 
2New leases may contain an escalation clause to provide for annual changes in real estate taxes and operating costs.

Prospectus Number: PDC-09- W A 17 
Background 
The EEOC is a bipartisan commission comprised of five presidentially appointed members, including the Chair, Vice Chair, and three Commissioners. 
The EEOC is responsible for enforcing Federal 
laws that make it illegal to discriminate against a job applicant or an employee because 
of the person's race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy), national origin, age 
(40 or older), disability, or genetic information. It is also illegal to discriminate against a person because the person complained about discrimination, filed a charge 
of 
discrimination, or participated in an employment discrimination investigation or lawsuit. 
The EEOC has the authority to investigate charges of discrimination against employers that are covered by the law. Additionally, the 
EEOC provides leadership and guidance to Federal agencies 
on all aspects of the Federal Government's equal employment opportunity program. 
Justification 
The current lease at 131 M Street NE expires on October 8, 2018. The EEOC is projecting a staffing increase 
of new hires to address Federal and private sector case backlog. The EEOC 
requires continued housing for the personnel currently working in this location, as well as 
those additional personnel anticipated to be hired. 
Acquisition Strategy 
In order to maximize the flexibility and competition in acquiring space to the EEOC, GSA 
may issue a single, multiple-award solicitation that will allow offerors to provide blocks of 
space able to meet requirements in whole or in part. All offers must provide space consistent with the delineated area defined 
by this prospectus. 
Summary of Energy Compliance 
GSA will incorporate energy efficiency requirements into the Request for Lease Proposals 
and other documents related to the procurement of space based on the approved prospectus. 
GSA encourages offerors to exceed minimum requirements set forth in the procurement and 
to achieve an Energy Star performance rating of75 or higher. Resolutions 
of Approval 
Resolutions adopted by the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and the 
Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works approving this prospectus will 
constitute approval to make appropriations to lease space in a facility that will yield the required rentable area.

Prospectus Number: PDC-0 t-WA 17 
FEMA 's mission is to support Americans and first responders to ensure that as a Nation 
we work together to build, sustain, and improve our capability to prepare for, protect against, respond to, recover from, and mitigate 
all hazards. The Robert T. Stafford 
Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, Public Law 100-707, signed into law November 23, 1988, amended the Disaster Relief Act 
of 1974, Public Law 93-288. It created the system in place today by which a 
Presidential Disaster Declaration of an 
emergency triggers financial and physical assistance through FEMA. The Act gives FEMA the responsibility for coordinating government-wide relief efforts. Justification The lease at 
400 C Street expires prior to FEMA's planned move to St. Elizabeths campus under the Enhanced 
Plan. GSA currently pays approximately $5.5 million in annual rent for the leases that are proposed to be housed in this extension, a cost to the Government and taxpayer that 
will no longer be incurred once the Enhanced Plan is fully executed. Therefore, authorization is needed to extend the lease for a short term to align with the move to St. Elizabeths. As 
the leases at 800 K Street, NW, expire in 2016 and 
2019, personnel will relocate to 400 C Street, SW. The personnel in the lease at 1800 
South Bell Street will backfill the lease at 400 C Street, SW, by the end of the 2016. The balance 
of the leased space, not necessary under the extension, will be returned to the lessor. The President's Fiscal Year (FY) 
2017 budget proposed the funding necessary to complete the design and construction 
of a new facility to house FEMA at the St. 
Elizabeth's campus. As presented in the FY 2017 capital program prospectus in support 
of the DHS consolidation at the St. Elizabeths campus, GSA anticipates that construction completion 
of the new FEMA facility will occur in FY 2019. 
Resolutions of Approval 
Resolutions adopted by the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and the 
Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works approving this prospectus will constitute approval to make appropriations to lease space in a facility that 
will yield the required rentable area. 2

Provided that, except for interim leases as described above, the Administrator may not enter into any leases that are below pro-spectus level for the purposes of meeting any of the requirements, or portions thereof, in-cluded in the prospectus that would result in an overall utilization rate of 134 square feet or higher per person.

Justification The current lease at 
801 Eye Street NW, Washington, DC, expires December 31, 2018, 
and will expire prior to ICE's move to the St. Elizabeths campus under the Enhanced 
Plan. GSA pays approximately $5.1 million in annual rent, a cost to the Government and taxpayer that 
will no longer be incurred once the Enhanced Plan is fully executed. Therefore, authorization is needed to extend the lease for a short term to align with the move to 
St. Elizabeths. ICE will attain a reduced footprint upon the move to the St. 
Elizabeths campus. Retrofit of ICE space to achieve a reduction in square footage is not cost beneficial under this short-term extension Resolutions 
of Approval Resolutions adopted by the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and the 
Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works approving this prospectus will constitute approval to make appropriations to lease space 
in a facility that will yield the required rentable area. 
Interim Leasing 
GSA will execute such interim leasing actions as are necessary to ensure continued housing 
of the tenant agency prior to the effective date of the lease. It is in the best interest 
of the Government to avert the financial risk of holdover tenancy.

COMMITTEE RESOLUTION  
LEASE —DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY ,

WASHINGTON , DC Resolved by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the U.S. House of Rep-resentatives, that pursuant to 40 U.S.C. §3307, appropriations are authorized for a lease ex-tension of up to 502,997 rentable square feet of space for the Department of Homeland Se-curity, Immigration and Customs Enforce-ment currently located at 500 12th Street SW in Washington, D.C. at a proposed total an-nual cost of $22,635,000 for a lease term of up to 4 years, a prospectus for which is attached to and included in this resolution. Approval of this prospectus constitutes au-thority to execute an interim lease for all tenants, if necessary, prior to the execution of the new lease. Provided that, the Administrator of General Services and tenant agencies agree to apply an overall utilization rate of 238 square feet or less per person, except that, if the Admin-istrator determines that the overall utiliza-tion rate cannot be achieved, the Adminis-trator shall provide an explanatory state-ment to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Rep-resentatives prior to exercising any lease au-thority provided in this resolution. Provided that, except for interim leases as described above, the Administrator may not enter into any leases that are below pro-spectus level for the purposes of meeting any of the requirements, or portions thereof, in-cluded in the prospectus that would result in an overall utilization rate of 238 square feet or higher per person. Provided that, to the maximum extent practicable, the Administrator shall include in the lease contract(s) a purchase option.

Provided further, that the General Services Administration shall not delegate to any other agency the authority granted by this resolution.

WASHINGTON, DC 
Prospectus Number: PDC-04-WA 17 
Executive Summary 
The General Services Administration (GSA) proposes a lease for approximately 502,997 
rentable square feet for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), currently located at 
500 12th Street SW. Washington, DC 
ICE has occupied space in the building since January 17, 2008, under two leases that expire January 
16, 2018. 
The lease will enable ICE to provide continued housing for the current personnel and meet its current mission requirements. Improvement to 
ICE's utilization rate will be achieved 
upon the agency's move to the St. Elizabeths campus under the Enhanced Plan 
for DHS headquarters consolidation.

1 DHS security requirements may necessitate control of parking at the leased location. This control may be accomplished 
as a lessor furnished service, an operating agreement with the lessor, or as part ofthe Government's 
leasehold interest in the building(s). Any parking included in the Government's leasehold 
interest may result in a total proposed annual cost in excess of the amounts indicated above. 
2This estimate is for fiscal year 2018 and may be escalated by 2.1 percent annually to the effective date of 
the lease to account for inflatmn. The proposed rental rate is fully serviced including all operating expenses whether 
paid by the lessor or directly by the Government. GSA will conduct the procurement using prevailing 
market rental rates as a benchmark for negotiating this leaore to ensure that lease award is made 
in the best interest of the Government. 
:; Any new lease may contain escalation clauses to provide for annual changes in fe'dl estate taxes and 
operating costs.

WASHINGTON, DC PBS 
Prospectus 
Number: PDC-04-W 
A 17 Current Total Annual Cost: 
$20,578,200 (1/17/2008) 
Justification The current leases 
at 500 12111 Street SW, Washington, DC, expire January 16, 2018, and prior to ICE's move to the 
St. Elizabeths campus under the Enhanced Plan for the DHS 
headquarters consolidation. GSA currently pays approximately $20.6 million in annual rent for the leases that are proposed to be housed in this extension, a cost to the Government and taxpayer that will no longer be incurred once the Enhanced 
Plan is fully executed. Therefore, authorization is needed 
to extend the lease for a short term to align with the move to 
St. Elizabeths. ICE will attain a reduced footprint upon the move to St. 
Elizabeths. Retrofit of the existing ICE space to achieve a reduction in square footage is not cost beneficial under this short-term extension. 
Resolutions of Approval 
Resolutions adopted by the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and the 
Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works approving this prospectus will constitute approval to make appropriations to lease space in a 
facility that will yield the required 
rentable area. 
Interim Leasing GSA 
will execute such interim leasing actions as are necessary to ensure continued housing 
of the tenant agency prior to the effective date of the lease. It is in the best interest 
of the Government to avert the financial risk of holdover tenancy.

Star performance rating of 75 or higher. Resolutions 
of Approval Resolutions adopted 
by the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and the 
Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works approving this prospectus will constitute approval to make appropriations to lease space 
in a facility that will yield the required rentable area. Interim Leasing

Senate 
The Senate met at 3 p.m. and was called to order by the President pro tempore (Mr. H
ATCH ). 
f 
PRAYER The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-fered the following prayer: Let us pray. Eternal God, help us to so live that the generations to come will know about Your mighty acts. Today give our lawmakers the singularity of heart to seek, find, and follow Your will so that their legacy will be exemplary. Lord, guide them in the path You have created, inspiring them with the potency of Your powerful presence. May they trust You in times of adver-sity and prosperity, knowing that they will reap a productive harvest if they persevere. Keep them from under-estimating the power of Your great Name as You make them instruments of Your peace. Help us to not pray primarily in our distress and need but rather also in joy’s fullness and in our gratitude for abundant living. Lord, we ask for Your healing for the victims of the New York City and New Jersey explosions and the Minnesota stabbing attacks. We pray in Your merciful Name. Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The President pro tempore led the Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Repub-lic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. C

CCONNELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

MEASURE PLACED ON THE CALENDAR—S. 3348 Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, I understand that there is a bill at the desk due for a second reading. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will read the bill by title for the second time. The legislative clerk read as follows: 
A bill (S. 3348) to amend the Federal Elec-tion Campaign Act of 1971 to require can-didates of major parties for the office of President to disclose recent tax return infor-mation. 
Mr. M CCONNELL. Mr. President, in order to place the bill on the calendar under the provisions of rule XIV, I ob-ject to further proceedings. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-tion having been heard, the bill will be placed on the calendar.

ATTACKS IN NEW YORK, NEW JERSEY, AND MINNESOTA Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, over the weekend, several incidents that appear to be acts of terrorism left dozens injured and many across the country shaken. While we are thankful that no loss of life has been reported, we also know that the injured will face a difficult road to recovery and heal-ing. Our prayers are with each of them and all of those affected in this trying time. Authorities acted expeditiously to uncover the facts, and just hours ago they captured a suspect in connection to the New York and New Jersey bomb-ings. We thank them for their swift ac-tions and continued efforts to keep Americans safe. Although an arrest has now been made, there is still much we do not know about these incidents, in-cluding whether there was involvement of a terrorist organization overseas. In-vestigators are continuing their work even as we speak, and we are moni-toring that situation closely as it unfolds. No matter the motive behind these incidents, it is clear that we must do everything we can to bolster security measures and counter the threats fac-ing our homeland. These acts are very real reminders of the national security threats and challenges that we face both from beyond our borders and from within. Ensuring the safety of all Americans remains our top priority, so we will continue to do our part in working with our intelligence commu-nity, military leaders, and our law en-forcement personnel in their efforts to protect the American people. f 
CONTINUING RESOLUTION Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, Members have been working toward an agreement on a continuing resolution that will fund the government and pro-vide critical resources to support vet-erans and combat Zika. Senate Repub-licans stand ready to move forward with this important measure now. I encourage our colleagues across the aisle to work with us to complete the negotiations so we can advance this important measure.

HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES 
CAPTAIN MATTHEW D . ROLAND  
Mr. M CCONNELL. Mr. President, today I rise in honor of Kentucky’s bravest young men, one of whom, Capt. Matthew D. Roland, of Lexington, KY, gave his life in service to our country on August 26, 2015. Captain Roland was a proud airman and member of the 23rd Special Tactics

Squadron in Hurlburt Field, FL. He was 27 years old. Captain Roland was killed in combat at Camp Antonik in Helmand Province, Afghanistan. He was driving the lead vehicle in a convoy when that convoy was attacked by enemy combatants dressed as friendly Afghan forces. It was a complex attack. The first warning that something was wrong came when an enemy combatant ap-proached Captain Roland’s vehicle. When he was within 5 feet of the vehi-cle, he began to raise his weapon. With-out hesitation, Captain Roland’s first thoughts were for the safety of his fel-low servicemembers. He yelled ‘‘Insider attack’’ while radioing a warning to all vehicles in the convoy. Simulta-neously, he drove in reverse, away from the gunmen, to protect his passengers. Tragically, a split second later, the lead gunman who had approached the vehicle, shot Captain Roland, instantly killing him, but the message he had conveyed over the radio gave the other personnel in his convoy the oppor-tunity to take cover and ready their weapons. Because of his warning, American casualties were fewer and the enemy combatants were neutral-ized, including the one who killed Cap-tain Roland. For his actions, Captain Roland was posthumously awarded the Silver Star for Valor. The citation accompanying the award read: 
Captain Roland’s actions are in keeping with the finest traditions of military her-oism and reflect distinct credit upon himself, the NATO Special Operations Component Command . . . and the United States Air Force. 
Over the course of his military ca-reer, Captain Roland received several other awards, medals, and declarations, including the Bronze Star, Purple Heart, Meritorious Service Medal, Air Force Achievement Medal, Air Force Organizational Excellence Award, Na-tional Defense Service Medal, and NATO Medal. Captain Roland was born at Ells-worth Air Force Base in Rapid City, SD. His father, retired U.S. Air Force Col. Mark Roland, moved frequently for assignments, and Matthew grew up in Abilene, TX, and Albuquerque, NM, before the family settled in Lexington, KY, where Matthew attended Lex-ington Catholic High School. In high school, it was clear to many that Matthew was a driven young man who knew what he wanted out of life. Tim Wiesenhahn, his cross-country coach at Lexington Catholic, remem-bered that. Tim said: 
He really wanted to be successful. I like to say he was driven to succeed. You just kind of knew he was going to be a leader. . . . The best runners really work at it, and Matt really wanted to be successful, and he put in the work. 
A friend of Matthew’s from high school, Clint Roberts, saw the same de-termination in the future airman. He said: 
I don’t remember a time when Matt didn’t know what he wanted to do with his life. From the time we met at cross-country prac-tice in high school until the last time I talked to him, Matt always seemed like he controlled his life and path in a way that ev-eryone strives to. Matthew attained the Eagle Scout rank in Boy Scouting and graduated from Lexington Catholic in 2006. He en-tered the U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, CO, where he grad-uated in 2010 with a bachelor of science degree in aeronautical engineering. Matthew then completed the rigorous special tactics program in 2012 to be-come a special tactics officer. As an STO, he was a team leader who super-vised combat preparedness training for a 35-member team. He was a military static line and free-fall parachutist, Air Force combat scuba diver, and a joint terminal attack controller. He led reconnaissance, strike, and recov-ery missions. He was deployed three times over his 5 years of service in the Air Force, twice to Afghanistan and once to Africa, and wherever he served, he gained a reputation as a rock during stressful times, always cool under pres-sure yet always easy to befriend. Capt. Ben Self, a fellow special tac-tics officer, said: 
The attribute that stood out to me most was his unflinching stoic presence when we needed it most. I relied on Matt when times were toughest, and I will continue to do so as his memory lives on through all of us. 
‘‘Matt was anything but typical,’’ says Col. Paul Brister, his commander. ‘‘On the battlefield, he was a lion—le-thal, precise, humble and compas-sionate. He was always flawless. I’m convinced I learned more from him than he could ever learn from me.’’ Another airman said of Matthew: ‘‘He was unquestionably our leader . . . not just by the [regulations] or rank, but through his ability to command our respect and trust as men.’’ A letter written to Matthew’s par-ents after his death revealed what Mat-thew did when off duty. ‘‘Besides Matt’s great qualities as a teammate, air commando and USAF officer, Matt has two memorable habits,’’ wrote LTC John Sannes and CSM Dwight Utley. The letter continued: 
He loved to walk around in his American flag shorts, and he loved his mom’s chocolate chip cookies. As a testimony to Matt’s gen-erous heart, he burned his legs helping a con-tractor weld a gate while wearing his flag shorts, and he always shared his cookies with the guys on his team. 
Matthew’s loved ones are foremost in our thoughts as I share his story with my Senate colleagues and the entire Nation today. They include his par-ents, Colonel Mark and Barbara Ro-land; his sister, Erica Roland; his niece, Willamina Roland; his grand-parents, Dr. and Mrs. Earl Roland; his grandmother, Rita Thomas; and many other beloved family members and friends. Matthew’s final resting place is Ar-lington National Cemetery, not far from where we stand. He was buried with full military honors. One of Matthew’s fellow airmen said this about hearing of his death: [Matthew] brought America to the tent flaps and mud walls of our enemies on two continents. . . . He did not compromise on what he believed, and the nation is lucky he spent his time and energy protecting her. 
I couldn’t agree more. I am sure my colleagues agree that America is in-deed lucky to have had Capt. Matthew D. Roland fighting for our freedoms. I would like his family to know that the Members of the Senate honor his serv-ice and his sacrifice and will be forever grateful.

CONTINUING RESOLUTION Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have been asked a number of times walking into my office this morning if there has been an agreement on the Zika funding and the continuing resolution, which is to keep our government open and fund-ed. No, we have not is the answer. We have made progress. I am encouraged by the headway we have made. But as I said before, as Democrats, we are going to be cautious. There is still work to be done before we can say there has been an agreement made. 
f 
TERROR ATTACKS IN NEW JER-SEY, NEW YORK, AND MIN-NESOTA Mr. REID. Mr. President, many Americans are taking the news about this weekend’s terror attacks in New Jersey, New York, and even Minnesota very seriously. As a country, we are al-ways stunned when these violent acts occur, and we are absolutely sickened by the acts of violence of this terrorist activity. We grieve with the victims, their families, and their loved ones. I had a long, thorough briefing today by the FBI. I appreciate their good work always. They have a difficult job doing everything they can to make sure we are safe. I am aware of the many people in-jured in these cowardly attacks, in-cluding police officers. I wish them all a full and complete recovery. Despite the many injured, we are very grateful that no one was killed in these attacks. It is a credit to both law enforcement and America’s terrific, good, brave first responders. Earlier today, the suspect wanted in connection with these cowardly at-tacks was shot and apprehended by po-lice officers, but, of course, not before he wounded two of these police officers. These officers’ quick response most likely kept Americans safe. These events remind us of these brave men and women who risk their lives every day to protect the Amer-ican people. First responders in New York, New Jersey, and Minnesota rushed into danger this weekend to protect innocent people. They cer-tainly saved lives. Now we must do ev-erything we can to ensure justice is

served and law enforcement gets the support needed to conduct their inves-tigation. It is not enough to simply offer help after these heinous attacks take place. Congress must do more to prevent these acts of terrorism altogether. There are things we can do, and some of them are really easy. Right now, as we speak, there is a loophole in our law that allows potential FBI terror sus-pects to legally purchase guns and ex-plosives. Stop and think about that for just a moment. A person with sus-pected ties to terrorism can walk into a store now and buy all of the explo-sives, all the guns, and all the ammuni-tion they want. In Nevada, a man who has been so charitable has set up a camp for chil-dren every summer. It costs him lots of money. It is in a beautiful part of the mountain area right outside of Las Vegas. We have, within 10 minutes of Las Vegas, a 12,000-foot mountain. At the foot of those mountains, he has a beautiful camp. Here is what they are doing now. You can go to a gun store in Las Vegas, and you can buy explosives. They put them up in the trees. We don’t have that many trees in Nevada. They will put explosives up in a tree, and they shoot at it, and it blows up. It blows up the tree and anything around it. That is for sport. Anyone can walk into a gun store and buy explosives. It doesn’t matter who it is. You can also be a terrorist and do the same thing. Again, I ask ev-eryone to think about that. A person with suspected ties to terrorism can walk into a store now and buy all of the explosives they want. They can buy all the guns they want. The so-called terror gap is out-rageous and terribly reckless. How can something like this go unaddressed in modern-day America? Democrats have tried repeatedly for the past year to close that loophole, but we have been prevented from doing that by the Republicans. We can argue from now on about whether this bill could have prevented this weekend’s attacks, but one thing is for sure: It could prevent the next attack. But we know this loophole shouldn’t exist. We know terror suspects shouldn’t be given a free pass to buy all the guns and all the explosives they want, and we know the American peo-ple want this loophole closed. Eighty- five percent of the people in Indiana, in Nevada, in Kentucky—85 percent of the people in America—support legislation keeping explosives and guns out of the hands of suspected terrorists. If you can’t fly, why should you be able to buy a gun? If you can’t fly, why should you be able to buy explosives? The only reason the FBI terror suspects are al-lowed to buy guns and explosives is simply because of Republican opposi-tion. That is the reason. This state of affairs defies belief. It is hard to believe that in America today an FBI terror suspect who cannot fly on an airplane can walk into a gun store in Las Vegas, New York City, or anyplace and legally purchase explo-sives and assault weapons. But it is true because Republicans refuse to close the terror gap loophole. In the aftermath of these attacks, our constituents are looking for us to help. They want to feel safe. They want to be safe. We can help provide that safety by closing the terror loophole, but Democrats can’t do it alone. We need help from the Republicans. Mr. President, I see no one seeking recognition, so I ask the Chair to an-nounce the business of the day.

ZIKA VIRUS FUNDING  
Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, we have a bit of good news because earlier today the CDC, or the Centers for Dis-ease Control, announced that it had lifted its travel advisory to not go into a section north of downtown Miami called Wynwood. It is the neighborhood where the first locally transmitted Zika virus was found. So the fact that they said today that this area is no longer considered an area of active transmission is certainly good news, not only for those who live there but for those businesses that are dependent on those who are planning to visit there. That is just one area of Florida. There are now 835 active cases of Zika-infected people in the State of Florida. If you compare that to the number for the total United States, talking about infections, in 49 of the 50 States, it is 3,132. If you add our broth-ers and sisters in Puerto Rico and the territories, fellow American citizens, 17,315 are infected with the Zika virus. In Florida, 86 pregnant women are in-fected with the Zika virus. The total in the Nation is 731. In Puerto Rico—pri-marily there, although bringing in all the territories, it is 1,156. Combining Puerto Rico, the territories, and the United States, we are talking about close to 2,000 pregnant women infected with the Zika virus. We know that the CDC has said that there is anywhere from a 1-percent to 12-percent chance—if a woman is in-fected in the first trimester of preg-nancy, there is a 1- to 12-percent chance that her baby will be born with defects. If you do the math on the near-ly 2,000 pregnant women, we are talk-ing about a substantial number of birth defects, including the possibility of what we have heard about and seen— microcephaly, babies with a deformed brain and shrunken head. In Puerto Rico they already had one live birth of microcephaly and they had one who did not live after birth. We can expect to see huge numbers coming on down the line. That is all the more reason for us—since we start-ed our request for funding last spring— to get at this by doing a Zika vaccine. It is now ready to go into the FDA first trials. A vaccine is at least 2 years away, but we have to get started, and that costs money. The administration has been robbing Peter to pay Paul, finding every little pot of money that it can borrow from since last spring in order to try to fund the preventive measures of a vaccine, mosquito control, and all the attend-ant health expenditures through our health care centers that are sponsored and paid for by the government, and particularly for the very poor. As a matter of fact, the government raided the Ebola fund of $576 million to ad-vance it to Zika. Well, we need to pay back all of those funds that were raid-ed, and that is incumbent upon us now here at the last minute before we ad-journ to go home to campaign before the election. You know, those words are suddenly similar to the words we used in early July, trying to get that done before the summer recess for the political conventions. Yet we did not. The good news is that it looks as though there is now an agreement on Zika. As a result, we can come up with a funding bill to keep the government open until we can pass a permanent funding bill for this fiscal year starting October 1. We will pass a temporary one until sometime in early December. That will give us a chance to try to do the permanent one. In the meantime, the government has to stay open. We have to fund the functions of govern-ment, including national security and the U.S. Department of Defense. So one would think that this bill would be all done, but, unrelated to Zika, there are other issues that are threatening the funding bill. At the end of the day, we will get it done. Some of the issues are over as arcane a subject as who is going to administer the issuance of domain names on the Internet. There seems to be some con-troversy over that. As a result, we are here at the last minute, at the last

hour, having to act on a funding bill, and now we have issues that are now all wound around the axle again. I want to say very positively that I appreciate the progress that is being made on the Zika funding. It is not as if we haven’t tried this before. Last May we had a bill that passed in a bi-partisan fashion for $1.1 billion that did not have the attached political riders. It passed in the Senate by 89 votes out of 100 Senators. Then, of course, the bill in the House of Representatives got all wound up with all kinds of political messaging. I want to state very posi-tively that I am very happy that it seems as if those issues have been put aside and there has been an agreement reached. Now let’s get through the rest of this on the funding bill and go ahead and execute our responsibilities that we have to the United States of Amer-ica. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Florida. 
TRIBUTE TO EMOGENE STEGALL  
Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I want to praise the work of a local elected of-ficial in Florida who has admirably served as supervisor of elections in Lake County, FL. This is an elected po-sition in which she has now served for 44 years, and she is going to retire from her position as the chief elections offi-cer after this upcoming election in No-vember. That is an incredible tenure of public service, and Emogene Stegall should be commended for being the longtime supervisor of elections. ‘‘Emogene’’ is a name that is almost synonymous with ‘‘Lake County’’ be-cause she has been an elected official for nearly half a century. What is so special about her is not only how many years she has held the office but how she embodied the details and the ideals of public service. Since she was first elected in 1972, a lot has changed about the way elec-tions are conducted, but through all of those decades, the same fundamental principles have guided Emogene Stegall’s work: a dedication to treating all voters fairly without any regard for party affiliation and safeguarding tax-payer dollars—no partisan politics, no attention-grabbing headlines, just humble public service. Before being elected supervisor, Emogene had already worked 14 years as the supervisor’s deputy, starting in 1958. At that time there were only about 17,000 registered voters in Lake County and a handful of voting ma-chines. Most of it was done by paper ballot. Her office used typewriters and carbon paper to function, and voting results were announced on the radio. Fast-forward to today. Emogene has been reelected many times over since winning her first election in 1972, and the number of registered voters in the county has gone from 17,000 to over 200,000. Now the supervisor’s office is filled with computers, and computer programs tally the votes on election day before publishing them on the Internet so the voters receive almost instant results. Even with all these changes, Emogene is still there, opening her of-fice to constituents of all political stripes and working long hours to make sure election day runs smoothly and that all citizens in Lake County can exercise their constitutional right to vote. Her principled approach to ful-filling her responsibilities explains why she has continued to be reelected to her post time and time again even though she is a registered Democrat in a county that shifted to Republican control long ago. The changes Emogene has witnessed run deeper than the office equipment and the party politics. When she was first elected, Lake County, along with much of the South of the United States, was still suffering from the scourge of Jim Crowe. African Ameri-cans in particular were often denied the right to vote. Even after the civil rights legislation was passed in the 1960s, the country still needed public servants to implement the law without prejudice in order to usher in change and combat racism. Emogene’s stead-fast commitment to ensuring the peo-ple’s right to vote helped achieve that transformation and in a way brings our Nation closer to realizing the ideal of equality that we have reached and have tried to reach since our founding. It is also notable that Emogene Stegall served as the first woman elected official and community leader at a time when women’s educational and professional opportunities were much more limited than today. After so many decades of public serv-ice, Emogene will oversee her last elec-tion day this November. But her legacy for being a committed and tireless pub-lic servant will continue to be remem-bered. She has used her position to ben-efit the community she was elected to serve. She never was elected, nor used it, for herself or her own interests.

So I am hon-ored to share her story and acknowl-edge her accomplishments on this oc-casion today on the floor of the Senate as Emogene Stegall will conduct and is preparing for her last election as Su-pervisor of Elections. What a great public service. What a great public servant whom we can honor today. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

JUSTICE AGAINST SPONSORS OF TERRORISM ACT  
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, over the weekend, we were reminded once again of the threat that terrorism poses to our communities all across this coun-try. I know we are all grateful the ex-plosions that occurred in New Jersey and Manhattan and the knife attack in Minnesota did not hurt more people. I am thankful for the authorities, the law enforcement officials, the emer-gency medical officials and others who have responded so heroically. I am grateful there has already been a sus-pect detained in the New York and New Jersey incident before he could at-tempt additional attacks. This is just another reminder, as if we needed more reminders, of the im-portance of remaining vigilant to the threat of terrorism in the United States. Our values and our way of life seem to be under near constant attack, certainly under constant threat. We have a responsibility to do everything we can within our power to support and protect those affected by the evil of terrorism within our borders. Last week, the Senate sent a piece of legislation, an important piece of legis-lation from my perspective, called the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act to President Obama for his signa-ture. He has until Friday to act on it. I want to clarify for my colleagues exactly what is contained in this legis-lation because I have heard from some stories that make me think they are being misled by some but also maybe there is just some confusion I can help clear up. This legislation, the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, or sometimes called the 9/11 families bill, makes some narrow amendments to a longstanding Federal statute, the For-eign Sovereign Immunities Act, and the anti-terrorism act. What it does provide is for Americans to be able to seek recourse in a court of law from governments or people who sponsor terrorist attacks on American soil. You would think that would not be particularly controversial. Put another way, this bill does not allow a lawsuit to proceed against a foreign nation un-less they are alleged to have been be-hind a terror attack on American soil. As I said, this is pretty straight-forward, which is why it passed the Senate and the House unanimously. I want to be clear what the bill does and does not do. First of all, the legis-lation does not single out any par-ticular country for some kind of unfair treatment. It stands for the simple proposition that Americans should have recourse against those involved in terrorist attacks on our homeland, just as they do against others who commit other wrongs. I have had some of my colleagues say: Yes, but perception is reality. Well, misperception is not reality. The fact is, there is no country mentioned in the legislation, this extension of ex-isting law. To the extent it singles out anybody, it only singles out countries, without naming any, that fund terror-ists who commit terrorism on our soil. Some have suggested this could hurt our relationship with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, in particular. This bill has nothing to do, on its face, with our

strong partnership with Saudi Arabia, which is based on mutual interests. The reality is, the nuclear deal struck by President Obama involving the country of Iran has done far more to damage our relationship with our allies in the Middle East, including the King-dom of Saudi Arabia. It has caused many of our allies, not just the Saudis but others in the Mid-dle East, to question whether we are a reliable ally in the areas where we do share a common interest. We know many of our Gulf State al-lies, including the Saudis, believe the President has not done enough to achieve his own stated goal of defeat-ing the terrorist army of ISIS, which threatens Saudi Arabia from Iraq, just across its northern border. Quite to the contrary, we know President Obama ig-nored the advice of his own military advisers and unwisely withdrew all combat forces from Iraq in a precipi-tous way before that country was ready and able to defend itself, only to see ISIS rush in and fill the vacuum left after the departure of American leader-ship and ground forces. The bottom line is that this legisla-tion should not upset our relationships with any country with which we share common interests, including the Saudis. They should not take passage of this legislation as a reason to some-how question our commitment to an alliance based on shared values or shared interests. This bill targets those who fund ter-rorist activity against us—plain and simple. I should also add that all this bill does is to give victims an oppor-tunity to have their case heard in court. It doesn’t decide the merits of the case. It simply gives them an ave-nue for justice. Second, I want to debunk this idea that somehow the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act will sud-denly result in lawsuits being filed against Americans by foreign govern-ments. The reality is this already hap-pens. We have an entire office at the Justice Department—the Office of For-eign Litigation—that defends the United States in foreign courts. As its Web site explains, that litiga-tion includes ‘‘litigation arising from U.S. agency or military activities in foreign countries,’’ which is one reason why, before we pulled out all of our troops from Iraq, President Obama and his administration should have done a better job pursuing a status of forces agreement with the country of Iraq. But because they did not negotiate that, they decided to pull out, and we have reaped the whirlwind as a result. While likely a minority, there are cases, in fact, brought abroad that im-plicate our own overseas activity. For example, in 2010, CBS News reported on a case in Pakistan in which the CIA was sued for an alleged drone strike. This is a matter of public record that CBS News reported. The point is that today foreign governments allow suits against the United States from time to time, and they are defended based on international law and based on the merits of the case. That is because of their legal systems and domestic poli-tics. Our laws are simply not consulted as a determining factor. Why would a foreign country apply American law or precedent or procedure? But let me also make clear: The Jus-tice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act makes only modest changes to current foreign sovereign immunity laws—laws that have already been passed by the U.S. Congress—and it has been written in a narrow manner to prevent such suits should any reciprocal law be passed. Finally, I remind my colleagues that this legislation was crafted and created through consensus. Before the Senate passed it several months ago, my col-leagues and I took great care to ad-dress concerns from Members on both sides of the aisle, as you would expect. Working with other Members, we made changes to the legislation they re-quested so we could keep support for this legislation and support for the families of victims strong. It then unanimously passed the Senate in May. Over in the House, it passed without dissent. I have to say that it is hard to find any piece of legislation that can pass unanimously in the Senate and in the House of Representatives. It just doesn’t happen very often. But even with so much bipartisan, bi-cameral support, President Obama still says he intends to veto the legislation. As I have said before, that is his pre-rogative, but I hope he does so soon so that Congress has the opportunity to vote to override his veto. Once he does veto it, I hope Congress will quickly act. I have been reminded of a passage in Henry Kissinger’s book called ‘‘World Order,’’ where he talks about how the West, in particular, often views the world as an orderly rules-based system. Of course, the problem with that is re-ality. The world does not all acknowl-edge a rules-based system, no matter who imagines it. Other countries will take actions based on what they per-ceive to advance their own interests, not because they just want to follow a certain set of rules that somebody else wrote up. That will remain true for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia even after the Justice Against Sponsors of Ter-rorism Act becomes law. That is why our relationship with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia will continue, because they have been fighting terrorism on their own soil and we know that we share other interests as well. But at the end of the day, we need to do what is right for the American peo-ple, just as other countries would do right for their own citizens. We should not change our domestic laws because of our concerns about other countries perhaps being offended or because they have other interests other than what we are trying to vindicate here, which are the rights of the families who lost loved ones on 9/11 due to a terrorist at-tack on American soil. They should have the opportunity to make their case if they can, and nothing in this judges the merits of the case or makes any conclusion about whether they will be successful or not. But, certainly, they represent part of the American people who we work for, and they are entitled to get access to the courts for the purpose of making the case if they can. This bill sends a clear signal to every country that the United States is not afraid to stand and ensure that our countrymen and countrywomen have the ability to pursue justice here in our courts. That is nonnegotiable. I hope the President will act quickly. The President can string this out into next week if he wants, but he has al-ready said he is going to veto it. So why put the families through any more delay, anguish, and uncertainty? The President should go ahead and veto the legislation. Then the Senate and the House of Representatives should take up a veto override vote. I am confident of what the outcome of that would be, based on the unanimous consent to the bill in the Senate and the unanimous vote in the House of Representatives.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES5876 September 19, 2016 
RECOGNIZING THE UNITED STATES AIR FORCE  
Mr. GARDNER. Madam President, I rise to recognize the U.S. Air Force on the occasion of its 69th birthday. On September 18, 1947, President Tru-man signed the National Security Act, which established the U.S. Air Force as an independent service equal to the U.S. Army and U.S. Navy. The mission of the U.S. Air Force is to fly, fight, and win in airspace and cyberspace, and Colorado is proud to call itself home to units that play a vital role in executing all aspects of the Air Force mission. Although it is the youngest of the armed services, the Air Force has ac-complished a tremendous amount—a tremendous amount—in those 69 years. With a combined force strength of more than 660,000 Active, Reserve, Na-tional Guard, and civilian personnel within the U.S. Air Force, it is a force to be reckoned with. The U.S. Air Force’s ability to maintain air superi-ority is evidenced by the fact that the last time an American ground troop was killed by ordnance delivered from an enemy aircraft was in 1953. On any given day, there are more than 21,000 Air Force personnel de-ployed to 179 worldwide locations, 16,000 airmen deployed to the CENTCOM area of operations, and more than 1,000 airmen working di-rectly with partner nations. While American airmen serve all over the world, there are thousands of airmen in my State of Colorado protecting our Nation’s interests. Colorado is home to five major Air Force installations that include Buck-ley Air Force Base, Schriever Air Force Base, Peterson Air Force Base, Chey-enne Mountain Air Force Station, and the United States Air Force Academy. Buckley Air Force Base is home to the 460th Space Wing and has air oper-ations, space-based missile warning ca-pabilities, space surveillance oper-ations, space communications oper-ations, and support functions. If North Korea, Iran, or any adversary fires a missile at the U.S. homeland, Buckley would be the first to see it. Buckley is also one of 18 bases nationwide being considered by the Air Force to host the next-generation F–35 jet, and it is my firm belief it fully merits that designa-tion as well. Peterson Air Force Base, named after 1st Lt. Edward J. Peterson, a Colorado native, has been in operation since 1926. Over its 90-plus years, Peterson Air Force Base has served a variety of operational and training missions and is currently home to the 21st Space Wing and Air Force Space Command as well. Peterson is also home to the U.S. Northern Command—NORTHCOM—and the North American Aerospace Defense Command, or NORAD. NORAD- NORTHCOM is responsible for pro-tecting the U.S. homeland from the myriad of threats we face in today’s complex global security environment. On a day like today, when we reflect on what happened in Minnesota, when we reflect on what happened in New Jer-sey, and when we reflect on what hap-pened in New York, we know that ef-forts to protect our homeland are criti-cally important. In a recent letter to the President, several colleagues and I expressed grave concerns about the rapid ad-vancement of North Korea’s nuclear ballistic missile program. That regime represents a grave threat to global peace and stability and is a direct threat to the U.S. homeland—and that is what our bases in Colorado are re-sponsible for. While we in Congress urge the President to take actions to counter the North Korean threat, the American people rely on the hard- working men and women at NORAD- NORTHCOM to protect us from this rogue regime. Just down the road from Peterson Air Force Base is Schriever Air Force Base, which is home to the 50th Space Wing of the Air Force Space Command. Schriever provides command and con-trol for over 170 Department of Defense warning, navigational, and commu-nications satellites. The global posi-tioning satellite, or GPS, is operated by the 2nd Space Operations Squadron at Schriever. If you successfully use your Google Maps today, it is because of the good work by the satellite opera-tors at Schriever. Schriever is home to the Joint Inter-agency Space Operations Center, or JICSpOC. Established in 2015, the JICSpOC consolidates efforts between the DOD, U.S. Strategic Command, and the intelligence community to create unity of effort and facilitate U.S. infor-mation-sharing across the national se-curity space enterprise. JICSpOC will enhance U.S. space operations, con-tribute to operational command and control within the Department of De-fense, and improve the Nation’s ability to protect and defend critical infra-structure in an increasingly contested space environment. Since 1966, Cheyenne Mountain Air Force, stationed in Colorado Springs, has been a synergistic hub for tracking security threats worldwide and serves as an essential component to the de-fense of North America and global se-curity. Cheyenne Mountain is an engi-neering marvel that provides an elec-tromagnetic pulse-hardened facility to protect our Nation’s most vital inter-ests. Many of the people around the country may know Cheyenne Mountain Air Force Station as the site of Mat-thew Broderick in the movie ‘‘WarGames.’’ Last but not least of the major Air Force installations in Colorado is the U.S. Air Force Academy. Since the 1955 swearing-in of its first class of cadets, the Air Force Academy has been devel-oping leaders of character to lead the world’s best Air Force. The Air Force Academy educates, trains, and inspires men and women to become officers of character, motivated to lead the U.S. Air Force in service to our Nation. In addition to celebrating the Air Force’s 69th birthday, I would also like to recognize that this year, 2016, is the 40th anniversary of women cadets en-rolling in the U.S. Air Force Academy. Just as the Air Force leads the way as the preeminent global air power, the Air Force Academy has been leading the way with the integration of women cadets into the Cadet Wing. In 1972, the Air Force Academy issued Operational Plan 36–72, which laid the groundwork for the arrival of its first 156 female cadets in the sum-mer of 1976. In the proceeding 40 years, women cadets and graduates have made extraordinary contributions to both the academy and to the Air Force. These contributions are exemplified by women such as Michelle Johnson, who in 1980 became the first woman cadet wing commander, which is the highest ranking cadet in the academy, and then in 1981 she became the first woman cadet to become a Rhodes scholar. In 2013, Lt. Gen. Michelle Johnson became the first female super-intendent of any military service acad-emy when she became the super-intendent of the U.S. Air Force Acad-emy. Heather Wilson was the first fe-male veteran to serve in Congress. Lt. Gen. Susan J. Helms was the first woman graduate of the Air Force Acad-emy to go into space. Lieutenant Ros-lyn Schulte became the first female graduate killed by enemy action in 2009. These women and countless others are why the State of Colorado is proud, honored, and humbled to host the U.S. Air Force Academy. On behalf of all Coloradoans and a grateful nation, I wish the U.S. Air Force a happy 69th birthday. Aim high, fly, fight, and win. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. BLUMENTHAL.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5877 September 19, 2016 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I see my friend and colleague, the chair-man of the VA Committee, here. I will happily yield to him to speak first, or I can proceed and then yield to him afterwards. Mr. ISAKSON. I appreciate that. I yield to the Senator from Connecticut to begin. Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I am pleased and honored to be here today to speak in support of H.R. 5985, the Department of Veterans Affairs Ex-piring Authorities Act. We will vote on it shortly. I thank my colleagues for what I expect to be an overwhelmingly positive vote to affirm our commit-ment to the veterans of America and that neither dysfunction nor distrac-tion of what is happening during this season of elections will prevent us from keeping the lights on in the Veterans Affairs Department. As its name implies, this measure would maintain 27 vital ongoing pro-grams and services that the VA pro-vides through the next year. I com-mend Chairman M
ILLER and Ranking Member T
AKANO in the House for draft-ing this bipartisan measure that is so important and necessary. We have worked collaboratively with them. Chairman I
SAKSON and I have met with them numerous times, and it has truly been a cooperative and collaborative effort. This legislation authorizes an in-crease in the existing VA caregivers program of $10 million, going from $724 million to $734 million, as well as a grants program that assists homeless veterans and provides them with sup-port services. The bill we will vote on this evening will also give the Secretary of the VA the exact same power as the Secretary of Education has with respect to title IV in the event of a university’s sudden loss of accreditation. It is critically important. As we have seen with ITT and Corinthian, for-profit colleges have abruptly closed, leaving veterans stranded. This bill will empower the VA Secretary to provisionally approve programs for use with the GI bill so that veterans may transition to an-other course of study. Without this provision becoming law now, veterans who attended those schools like ITT may find themselves in a similar un-tenable, unacceptable, unfair situation. They lose education benefits and, equally troubling, benefits for their housing and food allowance, which they so critically need. I am pleased we can vote on this measure tonight and send it to the President’s desk for his signature. But the simple, stark fact is that this bill is simply a small down payment—a small step in the direction that we must move and that the Senate must accomplish in the days that remain in this session to honor all who have served. It is just one of a series of con-gressional actions that are needed be-fore we recess to ensure that for-profit schools that put their profits before veterans’ rights to an education do not hurt our veterans as their business model collapses. The Senate should also pass the Vet-erans Education Relief and Reinstate-ment Act that Senator TILLIS of North Carolina and I have introduced. This bill is bipartisan, as is this bill, and would grant an emergency housing sti-pend to those students who are ad-versely affected by destabilizing per-manent school closures. Corinthian College and, more recently, ITT give a voice and face to this staggeringly real problem for so many veterans who are the victims of the exploitation by these for-profit schools. Our mission of ensuring that no vet-eran is left behind will not be com-pleted by the vote we take this evening. It is just a down payment. I urge my colleagues to join with me in supporting H.R. 5985 and beginning and concluding the hard work of passing other bills that have been reported out of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Com-mittee, with the strong bipartisan work, collaboration, and partnership among the chairman, Senator I
SAKSON , and myself. I thank Senator I
SAKSON for being here this evening, and I will be honored to yield to him now. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Georgia. Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I am honored to join the ranking member, Senator B
LUMENTHAL from Con-necticut, on this important day. This morning when I woke up, I began preparing for a speech I made at Oglethorpe University at 11 o’clock this morning on Constitution Day, and it reminded me of what an important September day today is. Senator Robert Byrd, the distin-guished Democrat, majority leader, and President pro tempore of the Sen-ate for many years and who served here for many decades, amended an appro-priations act on September 19, 2004, to designate today as Constitution Day. So it is a great honor for me to speak on the floor to honor our veterans on the day we honor our Constitution be-cause, without our veterans, there would be no Constitution. Without those who fight to defend our freedom and our liberty around the world, there would be no Constitution. So it is a great day to do this. I wish to express my agreement with exactly what Senator B
LUMENTHAL  said. This is a mere down payment. It is an acknowledgment. There is lots of work to be done. Critically, though, this extender bill addresses any num-ber of programs in the VA that will ex-pire at the end of the fiscal year unless they are extended. Most importantly are homeless programs, which are criti-cally important, and adaptive sports programs, which are critically impor-tant as well. So by adopting this bill, our home-less programs will stay in place and our adaptive sports programs will stay in place. As Senator B
LUMENTHAL said, should the Secretary of Education shut down an institution midterm, this pro-vides help to that student who is a vet-eran to see to it that they don’t lose their benefit and they can continue their education. Again, this is a small down payment. We have other things yet to be done. Hopefully, they will be done after we come back for the lameduck session after the election. But tonight, all Members of the Senate from both par-ties—Republicans and Democrats—can help us make a down payment on Con-stitution Day to those who make our freedom and liberty possible—our vet-erans of the United States of America. I urge an ‘‘aye’’ vote from each Mem-ber of the Senate. I yield back the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient sec-ond. The clerk will call the roll.

VOTING RIGHTS Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, last year our country celebrated the 50th anni-versary of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, one of the most important pieces of legislation that was passed in the 20th century. It opened the door for millions of Americans to exercise their constitutional right to vote. But this year will mark the first Presidential election in half a century without the full protections guaranteed by that landmark law. One of the worst deci-sions this corporate-dominated Su-preme Court made was Shelby County v. Holder, which struck down a key part of the law, taking the teeth out of provisions that protect voters from suppression laws. Since that misguided decision, States across the country have passed new voting restrictions that would dis-enfranchise hundreds of thousands of Americans. At least 17 States have passed new voting restrictions since the Shelby County restriction. We know who is hurt most by these laws— African Americans, Latinos, young people, and seniors. In North Carolina, before enacting one of these laws, the State legislature specifically asked for data on voting patterns by race. Once they had this data, they decided to eliminate or limit the voting methods used by Afri-can-American voters. Thankfully, the Fourth Circuit Court struck down this blatant attempt to disenfranchise one group of voters, writing: ‘‘The new pro-visions target African Americans with almost surgical precision.’’ In my State of Ohio, the courts have shamefully allowed laws such as these to stay on the books. Last week we were dealt multiple blows. First, the Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal on the Sixth Circuit’s decision ending ‘‘Golden Week’’—cre-ated by a Republican legislature a dec-ade ago—when voters can register and vote on the same day during the 1 week early-voting period. In May, Judge Watson—a George W. Bush appointee in the Southern District in Columbus— found that the laws limiting early vot-ing and registration would dispropor-tionately impact African Americans. Judge Watson did the right thing, but the ultraconservative Sixth Circuit ruled to overturn that ruling, ending ‘‘Golden Week.’’ Last week the Su-preme Court nodded 4 to 4 because the Republican majority leader won’t let the Senate do its job to have hearings and confirmation on Judge Garland. The Supreme Court declined to inter-vene. Then the Sixth Circuit overturned a lower court ruling that had thrown out new Ohio laws imposing stricter re-quirements on absentee and provisional voters. Judge Damon Keith’s dissent in this case captured what these restric-tions are really all about. He notes that during the committee debate over the law, one legislator asked: ‘‘Should we really be making it easier for those people who take the bus after church on Sunday to vote?’’—making it crys-tal clear exactly what they were tar-geting and whom they were targeting. Judge Keith continues: 
Democracies die behind closed doors. Voting is the ultimate expression of self- government. Instead of making it easier for all persons, unrestrained and unfettered, to exercise this fundamental right to vote, leg-islators are making it harder. States are audaciously nullifying a right for which our ancestors relentlessly fought and—in some instances—even tragically died. 
I would point out that only about a decade ago, this body and the House overwhelmingly, bipartisanly renewed the Voting Rights Act that the Court struck down. Now one political party is digging in in opposition to that. It is no secret what these laws are about. State legislators have made it per-fectly clear. In 2008, African Americans voted early in person at a rate more than 20 times greater than White voters. We all remember the scenes from Cuyahoga County, Cleveland, in 2004 when some voters waited as long as 7 hours to vote. For hourly workers, college stu-dents who work a third shift, parents who have to drop their children off at school, and many others, early voting ensures that their voices will be heard. In 2012, 10 percent of the electorate— 600,000 people—voted early in my State. That is 600,000 voices that might not have been heard were it not for early voting. But some judges who dress in suits and lead very privileged lives with generous benefits from taxpayers have decided these voices aren’t worth hearing. As Judge Keith said, democ-racies die behind closed doors. This body refuses to hold a hearing on the nominee who would have allowed the Supreme Court to hear the appeal on the ‘‘Golden Week’’ issue and issue a real decision. This body refuses to bring to the floor the bipartisan Voting Rights Ad-vancement Act. In 1981, when signing an extension to the Voting Rights Act, President Reagan called the right to vote ‘‘the crown jewel of American liberties.’’ Ronald Reagan would have seen his po-litical party today going in exactly the opposite direction, and that is sad. f 
HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES 
SEAMAN 1ST CLASS WILLIAM WELCH  
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise to honor Seaman 1st Class William W. Welch, a native of Springfield, OH—an American hero who laid down his life for our country during the attack on Pearl Harbor. Seaman Welch was known to his fam-ily as Billy. He enlisted in the Navy, as so many did in those days, at 17. He left during his senior year at Spring-field Catholic Central High School, so determined was he to serve his coun-try. On December 7, 1941, Welch was stationed on the USS Oklahoma, docked at the U.S. Naval Base at Pearl Harbor. The Oklahoma was the first to be hit that fateful morning by the Jap-anese. Of the more than 1,300 crew aboard, 429 perished that day—a loss of life sec-ond only to the better known USS Ari-zona. The ship capsized, and Billy Welch was among the first of so many Americans to make the ultimate sac-rifice for our Nation during World War II. Billy’s grieving family was dealt an additional blow when their son’s re-mains were not returned to them, and they were unable to give him a burial befitting his sacrifice. It wasn’t until 1943 that the Navy was able to right the Oklahoma and began trying to identify the remains. By then, with the technology available in the 1940s, it was too late for most sailors. Billy and his fellow sailors were buried as ‘‘unknowns,’’ and they had rested in the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Honolulu until last year. In 2014, Billy Welch’s nephew, Mi-chael, contacted my office. He was

fighting—for want of a better term— with the Department of Defense, beg-ging them to try to identify his uncle’s remains with the new technology avail-able in 2014. He was part of a movement of families and veterans trying to piece together where their loved ones were buried and get them returned home. In 2015, the Pentagon announced plans to exhume and attempt to iden-tify the fallen sailors and soldiers bur-ied in the Pacific. DOD began removing caskets and using dental records and DNA to identify the remains and re-turn those fallen heroes to their fami-lies. Billy Welch was identified. Now, with the help of dedicated staff in my office, next month he will finally be returned to Springfield and buried with full military honors in his hometown. It will be my honor to stand with Seaman Welch’s family at Saint Joseph Catho-lic Church in Springfield and witness this hero be shown the honor and ap-preciation he deserves and his family has been denied for so long. Billy and his fellow sailors may not have known the contribution they were making that day on the USS Oklahoma to future generations at home and around the world as the first to sac-rifice their lives fighting tyranny dur-ing the Second World War. That makes their actions all the more heroic. There is a reason we call them the ‘‘greatest generation.’’ We are losing more and more of that generation with each passing day. Less than 700,000 World War II veterans re-main with us. We lose some 430 of those heroes each day. My father, a World War II veteran stationed in New Zea-land and Iran—what he always called Persia World War II—passed away back in the year 2000. Projects like this one are all the more important and more timely. We need to identify these sailors and sol-diers now, while their loved ones are still with us and still able to pay their proper respects. We owe William Welch and all those who gave their lives for our country a burial and, equally im-portant, a tribute that befits their service and their sacrifice. I will be honored to take part in that tribute for Seaman Welch next month. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. M

TRIBUTE TO ROY SCHOTT Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a hard-working businessowner, veteran, and respected Kentuckian, Mr. Roy Schott. Mr. Schott recently celebrated 61 years of work as a mechanic and service station owner and 55 years as a U-Haul outlet. His dedication to his work is some-thing to be admired by us all. Mr. Schott’s journey began at the age of 15 when he discovered his inter-est and aptitude in mechanics. This led him to his first job in a garage, where he repaired motor vehicles. In 1951, he left his job and home to serve our coun-try in the Korean war as a motor ser-geant. Upon returning to London, KY, from his time in the military, he and a friend opened a service station. Mr. Schott made an addition to his busi-ness in 1961 after seeing a U-Haul ad in the paper. The service station became Schott Marathon and U-Haul Dealer-ship. At that time, U-Haul charged only $3 a day to rent a trailer, later adding a $1 fee for hitch rentals. Mr. Schott’s secrets to U-Haul suc-cess are good help, good customer serv-ice, and a good field manager. To this day, he has remained active in his busi-ness, coming every day to work along-side his loyal employees and inter-acting with his customers. After the loss of his wife in 2002, Mr. Schott con-sidered retiring, but ultimately decided that he loves his job too much to ever stop. I am very honored to represent Mr. Schott here in the U.S. Senate and want to wish him congratulations on his many years of service not only to the people of London, KY, but also to this nation. I am sure my U.S. Senate colleagues join me in expressing grati-tude and admiration for his service as well. He truly represents the finest of Kentucky. Mr. President, an area publication, the Sentinel-Echo, published a compel-ling article on Roy Schott’s life. I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the RECORD . There being no objection, the mate-rial was ordered to be printed in the R
ECORD , as follows: 
[From the Sentinel-Echo, Aug. 22, 2016] S
TILL GOING STRONG : R OYSCHOTT CELE-
BRATES 61 Y EARS OF KEEPING VEHICLES ON  
THEROAD (By Nita Johnson) London businessman Roy Schott has many memories. He will share some of those, but often says they are not important. But after 61 years of operating Schott’s Service Station on Main Street, he has a lot of memories and a lot of knowledge to go with it. ‘‘Be sure to find out what kind of oil it needs,’’ he said to a customer who called his business on Thursday afternoon, before going into the service section and assisting an em-ployee with loosening bolts on a car part. Schott said he got involved in the me-chanic business because it paid better than some other vocations available in 1943. ‘‘I started working at a garage that is where the Sentinel-Echo is now,’’ he said. ‘‘I got $1.50 a day. Other places only paid $1 a day, except the railroad and it paid $1 an hour.’’ Schott learned to weld as part of his job, recalling that parts weren’t manufactured then as they are today. ‘‘If a bus came in with a broken window, you had to fix it with a piece of tin,’’ he said. Schott left the business in 1951 with many other Laurel Countians who went to serve their country in the Korean War. He served two years during that conflict ‘‘when all hell was going on.’’ War is no good memory for Schott, who still tears up when he thinks about the end of World War II. ‘‘When World War II ended, the bell at the courthouse rang all day,’’ he said. ‘‘There would be four or five bodies of boys come in every day.’’ Schott served as combat engineer in Korea, where he was a motor sergeant and oversaw 23 trucks. He remembers those trying times through a book presented to Korean veterans by the Korean government. The book shows pictures of the devastation during and fol-lowing the war there, but highlights the achievements made over the years as the country rebuilt. Once safely back home after the Korean War, Schott opened his service station on South Main Street near the former Ormsby Hardware. While also operating his service station, Schott became an authorized U-Haul rental facility. He credits Bill Ormsby for that venture—one that earned him recogni-tion from U-Haul last year for 55 years as an authorized dealer. ‘‘I’m the oldest one in the state, probably the oldest one in the country,’’ he laughed. But in 1955, Schott got a loan to start his own business. He remembers that day when his loan was approved. ‘‘It was August 28, 1955,’’ he said. ‘‘When you borrow money you know the date you got it.’’ He moved the business to its current spot on North Main Street across from London Elementary School in 1960. Now, 56 years later, he continues the tradition he began, still working performing his magic on brakes, tires and air conditioning units. The business has served him well, providing for his four children over the years. He also has grandchildren, of whom he cannot hide his pride. ‘‘Let me tell you about my grandchildren. No, that would take too long,’’ he said with a laugh. Schott plans to continue to work until he is no longer able, refusing to retire. When asked if he still works on vehicles himself, he holds out his hands as proof. ‘‘I guess I do,’’ he said. He once considered retirement following the death of his wife 14 years ago. But his son-in-law quickly talked him out of it. ‘‘He said, ‘What are you going to do, climb the walls?’ so I decided to stay open,’’ he said. He believes working and staying busy is why he continues to be able to serve resi-dents in the London and Laurel areas. ‘‘A friend who retired told me to work all I could,’’ he said. ‘‘He said the walls would close in on you after a little while. So when people ask me if I’m going to stay here until they have to carry me out, I tell them I guess they will.’’ f 
GEAR UP HAWAII Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, today, September 19, marks the beginning of National Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Pro-grams, GEAR UP, Week, and I would like to recognize the meaningful work of GEAR UP in Hawaii. Since 1998, GEAR UP has provided support and resources to low-income students across the country to inform them about, prepare for, and succeed in college. GEAR UP helps these students, many who are first-generation college students, overcome the challenges they face in their communities.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES5880 September 19, 2016 
GEAR UP Hawaii serves over 16,000 students each year from low-income and underserved communities through-out the State in grades 7 through 12 and in their first year in college. The program equips students with the tools they need to succeed in college and their careers. GEAR UP delivers a number of services to students, includ-ing supporting early college-level aca-demic preparation in high school, pro-viding opportunities for early college options, increasing college access and financial aid information to students and families, and advising students during their first year of college to in-crease first-year completion. GEAR UP Hawaii has gained national recognition for its success in closing the achieve-ment gap among groups traditionally underrepresented in higher education and helping low-income students pre-pare for college. Through its collaborative partner-ships between Hawaii’s State Depart-ment of Education, K–12 schools, the University of Hawaii, local businesses, and community organizations, GEAR UP Hawaii inspires students to see postsecondary education as something they can achieve. The early outreach GEAR UP Hawaii performs is key to improving access to postsecondary edu-cation for students from low-income families in our State. The program’s results demonstrate that GEAR UP Hawaii is making sig-nificant strides towards increasing the number of low-income students who are prepared for and enroll in college. For example, 20 percent of Step Up Scholars, a GEAR UP Hawaii program, graduated from high school in June 2015 with the Board of Education Rec-ognition Diploma, BOERD, compared to 14 percent of students statewide. The BOERD is an honors diploma that requires students to earn a minimum cumulative grade point average of 3.0 and complete a senior project. Addi-tionally, GEAR UP has increased the availability of High School Based Run-ning Start, HBRS, courses, which allow high school students to attend Univer-sity of Hawaii classes to earn both high school and college credits. For the Ha-waii class of 2014, 83 percent of students who took at least one HBRS course en-rolled in college the semester after graduation compared to the statewide average of 56 percent. Thanks to these programs, thousands of Hawaii’s stu-dents graduate from high school every year better prepared for college and for their futures. A college education is a path of op-portunity for our students. GEAR UP Hawaii has been and will continue to be critical in supporting the State’s goal of having 55 percent of working- age adults in the State earn a college degree by 2025. I commend GEAR UP Hawaii for the vital role it plays in helping Hawaii’s students access and excel in their higher education. ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
REMEMBERING BEN CRAIG ∑Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, all who knew Ben Craig know that his passing marks the loss of an exceptional family man, local leader, and community banker. Ben was a great neighbor and a shining example of a Kansan who im-proved the lives of all he knew. The youngest of five children, Ben was born in 1929 to Benjamin D. Craig, Sr., and Orpha (Cox) Craig. He grew up and went to school in Baxter Springs, where he was an avid baseball player and sports fan. During high school, he was the pitcher for the Baxter Whiz Kids, the local regional team. He attended the University of Kan-sas, and during his college years, he pursued his minor league baseball dreams playing with the New York Yankees and the St. Louis Browns. After the Korean war began in 1950, Ben enlisted in the Air Force and spent 18 months stationed in Tripoli, Libya. Following his deployment, he returned to the States and was stationed at Sewart Air Force Base near Nashville, TN. He was joined by his new bride, Evadean Talbot, who he married after returning home from Tripoli. In 1954, he was honorably discharged from the service as an E–5 tech sergeant. Ben’s long career in business began after leaving the Air Force when he took a job with the Cassville, MO, chamber of commerce. He later worked with the Kansas City, KS, chamber be-fore beginning a banking career that would span decades. Ben served as president of Metcalf Bank in Kansas City for 35 years and then as chairman of the board until 2007. When the bank was sold in 2007, Ben remained on the board of directors and served as chair-man emeritus until his death. In addition to strengthening the Kan-sas City economy with his work in the banking community, where small busi-nesses and families alike could depend on Ben for solid financial assistance and advice, Ben served in leadership positions in a number of local charities and service organizations. For 52 years, he had perfect attendance in the Over-land Park Rotary Club, which is where I first met him. He also played a key role in establishing many of the Kansas City institutions we know today, such as Johnson County Community Col-lege, Shawnee Mission Medical Center, and the Overland Park Chamber of Commerce. Ben was preceded in death by his wife of 52 years, Evadean. He leaves behind his friend and companion of the last 10 years, Vivian Sirratt, along with his daughters, Denise Koonse (Charles), Kellee Hearst (Rex), granddaughters, Amanda Lubiewski (Michael), Kelsey Houchen (Andrew), and great-grand-daughters, Abigail and Emily Lubiewski. Ben’s dedication to public service and constant desire to find ways he could help others will benefit generations of Kansans to come. He had a kind heart and giving nature. Ben was a natural leader who freely gave his time to all he knew. I am thankful for my friend-ship with him. May he rest in peace. ∑

REMEMBERING RODGER M
CCONNELL ∑Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, on July 21, 2016, shortly before his 72nd birth-day, the United States lost a great man, an outstanding soldier, and an unparalleled advocate for his fellow veterans—and I lost a great friend. Rodger McConnell’s legacy will be for-ever remembered as one of persever-ance, passion, a humbling work ethic, and an enduring love of Starbucks cof-fee. Born in August 1944, Rodger grad-uated high school in 1962 and found em-ployment with a local gas company for several years. Answering the call of duty, Rodger enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1966. He saw combat in Vietnam as a cavalry troop forward observer for mortars and artillery with the 9th Infantry Division and the 11th Armored Cavalry Regi-ment before his honorable discharge a year later. In his postwar years, Rodger over-came several personal hardships, in-cluding homelessness and posttraumatic stress disorder, but he remained undaunted and undefeated. It was these struggles that created an empathetic man, who became a tireless and fearless advocate for other strug-gling veterans. Eventually receiving a liberal arts degree from Carroll College and a mas-ter’s degree in K–12 education from Montana State University-Northern, Rodger spent several years as an educa-tor before he retired in 2003 and launched into his unwavering service for veterans in Cascade County. Working with State District Judge Greg Pinski, Rodger helped create a veterans court to help veterans navi-gate the justice system and get the help and treatment they need to get back on their feet. Rodger also played a pivotal role in constructing the Mon-tana Veterans Memorial, which serves as a landmark in Great Falls to honor those who have served. Most notably, Rodger spearheaded the ‘‘Stand Down’’ event in Great Falls, providing veterans with clothing and access to job training and health services. Through this important event, Rodger made a difference in the lives of hundreds of veterans. Rodger was also an extremely active volunteer, contributing to the Great Falls community by registering voters, hosting a radio show on a local Great Falls station, and volunteering with the local Optimist Club. In Rodger’s eyes, the community was his family, and he was theirs. Let us now take a moment to recog-nize the exceptional life of Rodger McConnell and the legacy he left be-hind. It is a legacy I hope each of us can aspire towards.∑

RECOGNIZING HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH 
HON. PETER J. VISCLOSKY 
OF INDIANA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 19, 2016 Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, it is with deep respect and sincere admiration that I rise to celebrate National Hispanic Heritage Month and its 2016 theme, Hispanic Americans: Em-bracing, Enriching, and Enabling America. From September 15, 2016, through October 15, 2016, in honor of Hispanic Heritage Month, the people of the United States will once again celebrate the cultures and tradi-tions and honor the many outstanding con-tributions of our Hispanic American brothers and sisters. Hispanic Heritage Month, which begins each year on September 15, recognizes the anni-versaries of the independence of five Latin American countries: Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua. Mexico and Chile observe their independence days on September 16 and September 18. Since its in-ception as National Hispanic Heritage Week in 1968, which later became National Hispanic Heritage Month in 1988, Americans have taken this time to not only honor the rich cul-ture and traditions of Hispanic Americans, but also to reflect on the tremendous impact His-panic Americans have had within their com-munities and throughout our nation. The tire-less efforts of generations of Hispanic Ameri-cans have resulted in a better America. America’s success is reliant upon the rich heritage and cultural diversity of its people. Hispanic Heritage Month celebrates the many Hispanic leaders and members of our commu-nities who have added to the prosperity of the United States in every facet of our society. Mr. Speaker, at this time, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to once again join me in recognizing Hispanic Heritage Month. Throughout America’s history, present, and future, the Hispanic community has played and will continue to play a major role in enriching the quality of life for the people of the United States, and for their outstanding contributions they are worthy of our respect and gratitude.

IN RECOGNITION OF GAM GRAPH-ICS AND MARKETING’S 40TH AN-NIVERSARY 
HON. BARBARA COMSTOCK 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 19, 2016 Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate GAM Graphics and Marketing in Sterling, Virginia who celebrated their 40th anniversary this July. Opened by Charles Grant in 1976, GAM Graphics and Marketing provides quality printing and commercial serv-ices to countless citizens throughout our great Commonwealth. GAM was founded in the 1970s with the mission of teaching marketable job skills to students. Originally the printing was done by the students, mainly serving churches and mission groups; however commercial requests started in 1976. Within five years GAM was producing print products ranging from busi-ness cards to full-bound books and bulk mail-ings. GAM is a company run with compassion and a focus on providing excellent quality and service to their clients. In 1985, Nathaniel Grant took the reins at GAM and with his lead-ership the company continued to grow. Na-thaniel and his sister Faith purchased the company from their parents in 1996. Under the guidance of Nathaniel and Faith, GAM modernized and the company continued to grow without any adverse effect on their excel-lent quality and service. In closing Mr. Speaker, I ask that my col-leagues join me in sending our most sincere appreciation to a company that has given so much to their neighbors. The Grant Family and the staff of GAM Graphics and Marketing serve as an example to all. On behalf of Vir-ginia’s 10th Congressional District I wish them continued success in the future. f 
IN RECOGNITION OF 90 YEARS OF TOLEDO BLADE OWNERSHIP BY THE BLOCK FAMILY 
HON. ROBERT E. LATTA 
OF OHIO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 19, 2016 Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, ninety years ago, Paul Block, Sr. took charge of the Toledo Blade and the Block family has led the es-teemed daily ever since. The Blade has been an institution of Northwest Ohio since 1835, but the steady guiding hand of the Blocks has led the newspaper to new heights over the past nine decades. The Toledo Blade has resided at the same location since shortly after Block Sr. pur-chased the downtown Toledo site in 1927 for $4.5 million. The day the building opened, Cal-vin Coolidge pressed a gold key from Wash-ington to start the new presses. Throughout the ups and downs in the city and region, the Blade has been there to report the news and keep its readers informed. The success of the Blade would not be pos-sible without the support and vision of the Block family. They have led the paper through revolutionary advancements in how the news is reported and distributed. That includes using technology like the Internet and social media to spread the stories of the day. The current leadership of John Robinson Block as Publisher and Editor-in-Chief of the Blade and Allan Block as Chairman of Block Communications has served the paper well into the 21st century as the daily still boasts a circulation of 120,000 readers. Along with print editions, readership is at an all-time high with countless others consuming the news through the website, apps, and on other plat-forms. Mr. Speaker, ninety years of media leader-ship from one family is very admirable, and it should be celebrated. I’d like to recognize the Block family for their leadership of a great Ohio institution, the Toledo Blade. f 
IN RECOGNITION OF BLUEMONT CONCERT SERIES’ 40TH ANNIVER-SARY 
HON. BARBARA COMSTOCK 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 19, 2016 Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the Bluemont Concert Series as it proudly celebrates 40 years of providing high- quality concerts and cultural events in local-ities throughout northwestern and central Vir-ginia. Originally, the organization received its name from its hometown of Bluemont in Loudoun County, Virginia. Since 1976, Bluemont has presented over 9,300 events fostering a sense of community in the Com-monwealth through its presentations of art and culture. This extraordinary concert series has entertained audiences of over three million people including schools, health care facilities, assisted living centers, and nursing homes. This is an important milestone for this wonder-ful organization. Cultivating a cultural and artistic presence in Virginia’s 10th Congressional District is impor-tant to the overall health of our community. It is organizations such as the Bluemont Concert Series that allow us to enjoy a broad range of diverse experiences that would be otherwise inaccessible. The mission of Bluemont, pro-viding family-oriented and affordable events, has given residents in Virginia the opportunity to enjoy music, song, poetry, and storytelling. The concert series has presented a wide range of musical genres including bluegrass, Hawaiian swing, folk, jazz, rock and roll, clas-sical flute and Caribbean steel bands; which has helped to strengthen the cultural spirit within our community. Over the years, Bluemont has reached lives, not only through its concert series, but also through its school programs and its Artists-in- Education initiative. Bluemont’s Outreach Pro-gram offers quality entertainment at no charge to appreciative audiences in nursing homes and assisted living facilities. Its outstanding work has earned Bluemont many accolades and awards, including the Distinguished Serv-ice Award from the Virginia Alliance for Arts Education. The Bluemont Concert Series has provided a valuable service to community and their families. Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in congratulating the Bluemont Concert Series on 40 years of serving the great Com-monwealth of Virginia. I wish Bluemont all the best in its future endeavors.

A RECENT ADOPTED RESOLUTION 
HON. JOHN J. DUNCAN, JR. 
OF TENNESSEE  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 19, 2016 Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, on August 9, 2016 I had a conversation with my good friend and Knoxville Attorney James M. Crain. Mr. Crain and I had the opportunity to dis-cuss the federal edict announcing that every public school in America is to allow students to use whichever bathroom they choose. During our conversation Mr. Crain discussed a resolution adopted by the West Knoxville/ Knox County Republican Club offered by Mr. Crain. Newscom published an opinion editorial ti-tled, ‘‘A Bathroom of One’s Own,’’ that is con-sistent with the adopted resolution. This article is well reasoned and is con-sistent with the views of many of the people from my District in East Tennessee. I think most people are tired of all the pub-licity on this issue and wish we could get back to a time when sexual preference was kept purely private. I also believe that the Federal government should have very limited power over the deci-sions State and local governments make about their schools. This has long been my position. Mr. Speaker, I would like to call to the atten-tion of my Colleagues and other readers of the R
ECORD the resolution adopted by the West Knoxville/Knox County Republican Club and the article that ran in The Weekly Standard on June 7, 2016. 
A BATHROOM OF ONE ’S OWN —NEWSCOM  Two weeks ago the Obama administration issued a federal edict decreeing that every public school in America allow students to use whichever bathroom they choose, under pain of lawsuit and/or loss of federal funding. Less than a week after that, New York City’s Commission on Human Rights issued its own edict, declaring that anyone under the city’s rule who refused to use the pre-ferred gender pronouns in dealing with transgender individuals—he, she, ‘‘xe,’’ or ‘‘hir’’—would be guilty of harassment and subject to penalties up to $125,000 for the first infraction and $250,000 ‘‘for violations that are the result of willful, wanton, or ma-licious conduct.’’ As law professor Eugene Volokh noted, the use of the term ‘‘harass-ment’’ is important, because it means that employers and businesses are responsible not just for their own behavior but for the be-havior of their employees and customers. And New York is, if you can imagine it, be-hind the times. Out in Oregon, Leo Spell, a fifth-grade teacher in the Gresham-Barlow school district, decided she was transgender. (Soell made this decision public only after receiving tenure.) Soell’s transition took the form of insisting that she was neither male nor female and demanding that her col-leagues refer to her as ‘‘they.’’ When other teachers continued to call Soell ‘‘she’’ and ‘‘her’’ and ‘‘Miss Soell,’’ Soell filed a harass-ment complaint. The school district settled with they for $60,000 and promised to initiate a sweeping set of transgender reforms. To hammer home the power dynamic, the school district claimed, in the statement accom-panying the payout, that it was quite ‘‘pleased’’ with the outcome. If you think that’s depressing, it could al-ways be worse. In Canada, the minister of justice recently introduced legislation ban-ning discrimination based on ‘‘gender iden-tity’’ and ‘‘gender expression,’’ which could join previous legislation criminalizing anti- trans ‘‘hate propaganda.’’ Should the bill pass, you could do up to two years, hard time, if you think the wrong thoughts or say the wrong words. If this all seems like an inordinate amount of heavy artillery for an infinitesimally tiny issue, that’s actually the point. Much as fights in academia are so bitter because the stakes are so small, transgender activists are crushingly authoritarian because the justice of their cause is so uncertain. What the trans project lacks in moral and logical clarity, it hopes to overcome with vehemence and in-timidation. The confusion is abundant. If you tell a transgender activist that gender is deter-mined biologically, through chromosomal composition, they reply, Well, what about people with Klinefelter (XXY) syndrome? But even with Klinefelter’s chromosomal anomalies, only a very small proportion of persons will fall into a category of ‘‘intersex.’’ As National Review’s Celina Durgin points out, arguments about the tiny, tiny sliver of the population who are bio-logically considered ‘‘intersex’’ actually run counter to transgender ideology, which places ‘‘gender identity’’—a self-discovered concept—on a separate plane above mere bi-ology. In other words, if being biologically XX is irrelevant to whether or not you are a girl, then why should it matter if you’re XXY? Resorting to arguments about the intersexed is actually an admission of the primacy of biology. Or consider ‘‘gender fluidity,’’ another pil-lar of the transgender project. According to this precept, some people may be one gender on Monday and another on Tuesday. Who can say which is which, or who is when? Not you. The individual is what he/she/they/xe/hir says at any given moment. And once you’ve divorced gender from biol-ogy and agreed that someone who is chromosomally XY can be a woman, you have no valid reason to object if, the next day, she says she is a man again. If you sign on for transgenderism, you’re signing on for gender fluidity, too. It doesn’t stop there, of course. Once you shoot past gender fluidity and the nongen-dered ‘‘theys’’ like Leo Soell and ‘‘pangenders’’ (who claim to be everything rolled into one), there’s a whole other uni-verse of gender identities out there. For in-stance, ‘‘otherkin.’’ What are ‘‘otherkin’’? Otherkin is the gen-der identity of people who believe that they are nonhuman. Last summer Vice.com profiled a fellow who identifies as a fox. Some identify as dogs. Some as lions. Some as dragons. Some otherkin even go through body-modifications to make their physical selves look more like their otherkin iden-tity. The otherkin aren’t officially part of the LGBTTQQIAAP alliance yet. But just wait. They’re coming. Because to deny them their place at the table—to deny that a human person can be not just an animal, but a crea-ture that does not even exist in the real world—is to put the entire transgender project in jeopardy. Because transgender theory, which posits that the self is infi-nitely plastic, cannot survive a single lim-iting precept. Fortunately, we are not yet fighting over the rights of otherkin unicorns. In the here- and-now, we merely have wars over public bathroom and school locker room accom-modations. This may seem like a small-scale concern. The Census Bureau and the New York Times tried to estimate the number of transgendered persons in the United States last year and came up with a figure some-where between 21,000 and 90,000. Or, to put it another way, transgenders probably make up between 0.007 percent and 0.029 percent of the American population. When you’re dealing with fractions this small, it’s hard to be pre-cise. But because virtue-signaling is the highest form of morality in modern America, the full force of the federal government is being brought to bear on transgender bathroom rights, not only through Obama’s federal edict, but through the Obama Justice De-partment’s fight against the state of North Carolina. In March, the elected officials of North Carolina voted on and passed a piece of legis-lation, HB–2, which was designed to stop the forced march toward mandating that people must be free to use whatever bathroom they desire. (It is instructive to note that the ini-tiatives pushing the transgender agenda are almost never enacted legislatively; they are often rammed through bureaucracies and commissions or accomplished by executive fiat.) HB–2 was not a perfect piece of legislation. But the reaction to it was illuminating. The Charlotte Observer’s editorial board pro-claimed, ‘‘Yes, the thought of male genitalia in girls’ locker rooms—and vice versa— might be distressing to some. But the battle for equality has always been in part about overcoming discomfort . . .’’ Which brings us to the final bit of confu-sion in the transgender project. At the heart of the bathroom issue is a simple question: Is there a valid reason for separate facilities for men and women? Is there any rational justification for having separate bathrooms, or locker rooms, or changing rooms, for men and boys on the one hand, and women and girls on the other? The trans argument, per the Charlotte Ob-server, is essentially ‘‘no.’’ By their logic, if women just need to get over their discomfort at seeing naked men next to them, then there’s no reasonable explanation for why women could want their own facilities. Except that this would mean there is no reasonable explanation for why someone who is transgender should prefer one set of facili-ties over another. If biologically born women need to ‘‘overcome discomfort’’ about having naked men around them, why shouldn’t a bi-ological man who identifies as a woman not similarly have to overcome his discomfort at being around other naked men? The logical paradox of the transgender bathroom war is that it insists that the type of gender and genitalia in a public facility is completely irrelevant—except to the transgendered, for whom it is of supreme im-portance. At the end of the day, if you’re not in favor of unisex facilities for all—one bathroom for everyone to use—then the transgender case falls apart. Because the transgender project tacitly admits that there are reasons of pri-vacy, modesty, and prudence for segregating the sexes. It merely wishes to trump these concerns from the vast majority for the spe-cial pleading of a small, powerful, and illiberal group. It is the very definition of the tyranny of the minority. R

Whereas, Persons—and particularly fe-males—are made extremely uncomfortable by the presence of persons of the opposite sex in such facilities; and Whereas, There is no way to determine the legitimacy of a claim of ‘‘gender identity,’’ thus opening the door to false claims made to gain entrance to such facilities for im-moral and illegal purposes; and Whereas, Agencies of the Federal Govern-ment have exceeded their lawful authority by construing various Acts of Congress as conferring a right to utilize such facilities designated for persons of the opposite sex upon persons claiming a ‘‘gender identity’’ different from their biological sex, to wit: a. On January 7, 2015, the Department of Energy Office for Civil Rights issued a letter construing 34 C.F.R. 106.33 (implementing 20 USC 1681(a)) as requiring that transgender students in schools that receive Federal funds must ‘‘generally’’ be allowed to utilize bathrooms and locker rooms assigned to the gender with which they identify. The Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit, citing def-erence to administrative construction, has reinstated a suit by a transgender ‘‘male’’ to require her Virginia high school to allow her to use the boys rest room, and b. The Department of Justice has sent a letter to the Governor of North Carolina, as-serting that the provisions of North Carolina H.B. 2 violates the Civil Rights Act of 1964 because it treats Transgender persons dif-ferently than non-transgender persons by de-nying all persons the right to use multi-per-son facilities assigned to persons of the oppo-site sex, and Whereas, the expanded interpretations set out above will require schools, in particular, to require that schoolchildren share toilet, locker and shower facilities with any person of the opposite sex that claims a different ‘‘gender identity,’’ and Whereas, with particular reference to 20 USC 1681(a), this expanded interpretation of ‘‘sex’’ will have the effect of mandating that transgendered ‘‘females’’ be allowed to try out for and compete in women’s sports and, because of the greater strength and speed po-tential of biological males, will largely de-stroy the very women’s sports programs that the provision was designed to foster, and which it has fostered with great success; Now, therefore, be it Resolved as follows; 1. That the foregoing expansions of these Acts of Congress to create rights never in-tended or contemplated at the time they were enacted is an unconstitutional exercise of legislative power by the Executive Branch, and must be addressed IMME-DIATELY! 2. That the United States Code must be amended to clarify the erroneous ‘‘interpre-tation’’ placed on it by the Executive Branch by enacting a statute worded substantially as follows: As used in this Code, the word ‘‘sex’’ refers only to biological sex unless expressly stated to the contrary. No such reference in this Code either requires or prohibits any par-ticular treatment of transgender individuals unless some particular treatment is ex-pressly stated therein. 3. That since such legislation is certain to be vetoed by our President, the foregoing bill MUST BE PASSED AND PRESENTED TO HIM in a timely manner, so that upon re-turning it to Congress, ample time for votes to override that veto can be held BEFORE THE ELECTION IN NOVEMBER. 4. That this resolution be forwarded to our Representative and to both of our Senators, with the notation that failure to vigorously pursue the passage of the above statute will be construed by the Club as your agreement with these unconstitutional actions by the Executive Branch. 5. The undersigned officers of the West Knoxville/Knox County Republican Club exe-cute this resolution in their capacities as of-ficers only, and that the undersigned rep-resent that this Resolution was passed with-out opposition by the voting members present at the June 13, 2016 meeting of the club.

CONGRATULATING THE LCHS ATH-LETIC HALL OF FAME CLASS OF 2016 
HON. BARBARA COMSTOCK 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 19, 2016 Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the following coaches, contributors, and athletes for being selected to the Loudoun County High School Athletic Hall of Fame Class of 2016. Pat McManus, Alan Smith, Dr. Robert K. Belote, James M. ‘‘Jimmy’’ Kidwell, Reginal ‘‘Reggie’’ Evans, Susan Moxley, David DiMillio, Kristen DiMillio, Kevin Grigsby, Jo-anna Penn, Shari Mayr, Derrick Ellison, and Marie Bolton were all named to the LCHS Hall of Fame. These individuals have earned this honor through their passion and commitment to athletics. These outstanding men and women’s hard work, perseverance, and athletic excellence are exemplified in their receipt of this honor. Coming from a family of educators, I under-stand not only how important a strong edu-cation is to the future of our country, but also the need for athletic competition to form a well-rounded member of society. We need to encourage more people to imitate these indi-viduals who have worked so hard to accom-plishing this incredible goal. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to highlight the importance of this achievement and what it represents for these men and women. I ask that my colleagues join me in congratulating them on being inducted into the Loudoun County High School Athletic Hall of Fame Class of 2016. I wish them all the best in their future endeavors.

CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE COST ESTIMATE FOR H.R. 4487 
HON. BILL SHUSTER 
OF PENNSYLVANIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 19, 2016 Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, in accordance with House Report 114–589, Part 1, I submit the following Congressional Budget Cost Esti-mate for H.R. 4487. 
CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE , U.S. C
ONGRESS , Washington, DC, July 5, 2016. Hon. B
ILLSHUSTER , Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. D
EAR MR. CHAIRMAN : The Congressional Budget Office has prepared the enclosed cost estimate for H.R. 4487, the Public Buildings Reform and Savings Act of 2016. If you wish further details on this esti-mate, we will be pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is Matthew Pickford. Sincerely, KEITH HALL. Enclosure. H.R. 4487—Public Buildings Reform and Sav-ings Act of 2016 H.R. 4487 would amend federal law to pro-vide new authorities to the General Services Administration (GSA) and the Department of Homeland Security’s Federal Protective Service (FPS) to manage federal real estate assets and security at those facilities. The act also would require GSA to prepare a number of reports for the Congress and the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to complete an audit of GSA’s national broker contract. Finally, the legislation would re-quire that lactation rooms be available in all federal buildings that are open to the public. Based on information from GSA and the FPS, CBO estimates that implementing H.R. 4487 would cost $3 million over the 2017–2021 period, mostly for GSA to prepare reports on a variety of subjects, including a comparison of the cost of owning or leasing space, an ex-planation of why the costs of construction projects exceed their initial estimates, a re-view of current rental rates, and an analysis of the use of refrigerants in equipment in-stalled in federal buildings. CBO also esti-mates that it would cost GAO less than $500,000 annually to prepare the required audit. Based on information from GSA, CBO estimates that the act’s requirements to es-tablish lactation rooms in federal buildings would have an insignificant cost because it would apply only to federal buildings that are open to the public and that have lacta-tion rooms designated for use by federal em-ployees. Finally, CBO estimates that pro-viding the FPS with additional law enforce-ment authorities would not have a signifi-cant cost. Enacting the legislation would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay- as-you-go procedures do not apply. CBO esti-mates that enacting H.R. 4487 would not in-crease direct spending or on-budget deficits in any of the four consecutive 10–year peri-ods beginning in 2027. CBO also reviewed provisions of the legis-lation that would require GSA to build a new headquarters for the Department of Energy (DOE), to be financed by exchanging or sell-ing DOE’s current headquarters in the For-restal Building Complex in Washington, D.C. Based on information from GSA and prop-erty developers, CBO expects that con-structing a new DOE headquarters could not be accomplished solely through a sale or ex-change of the current facility, and would re-quire the expenditure of additional appro-priated funds, which are not authorized by this act. Under H.R. 4487, if a new head-quarters facility could not be built, GSA would be directed to sell any underutilized or vacant property in the Forrestal Complex. Based on information from GSA, CBO does not expect that enacting the bill would re-sult in more sales than would otherwise occur under current law. H.R. 4487 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and would not affect the budgets of state, local, or trib-al governments. The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Matthew Pickford. The estimate was ap-proved by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy As-sistant Director for Budget Analysis.

IN RECOGNITION OF LOUDOUN INTERFAITH RELIEF’S 25TH AN-NIVERSARY 
HON. BARBARA COMSTOCK 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 19, 2016 Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to ac-knowledge the 25th anniversary of Loudoun Interfaith Relief, Loudoun County, Virginia’s largest food pantry, and their steadfast service to the good citizens of the Loudoun commu-nity. I would like to personally commend the volunteers who so selflessly dedicate them-selves to providing support to those less fortu-nate without asking anything in return. These notable citizens truly embody the very best of our nation’s values through their service to the community and commitment to the betterment of others’ lives. Loudoun Interfaith Relief has increased their service exponentially since it began. In 1991, LIR provided 50,000 pounds of food over 4,800 pantry visits. In 2016, LIR served 11,000 individuals in 73,000 visits with 1.2 mil-lion pounds of food. The pantry is now open six days a week and has over 320 volunteers working to provide services to those in need. This growth is a clear testament to the out-standing dedication to service conducted by the staff and volunteers at Loudoun Interfaith Relief. Mr. Speaker, it brings me immense pride to recognize such a fine organization, and I sin-cerely hope that we all can live up to their tre-mendous example. I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Loudoun Interfaith Relief. I wish them all the best and hope that they continue to be a positive example of service to the community.

TRIBUTE TO THE KOCH FAMILY FARM IN PUEBLO COUNTY, COL-ORADO 
HON. SCOTT R. TIPTON 
OF COLORADO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 19, 2016 Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Koch Farm, located in Pueblo Coun-ty, Colorado. Last month, the Koch Farm was honored by the Colorado Department of Agri-culture and History for its 102 years of con-tributions to Colorado’s agriculture economy, and its deep family roots in the community. The Koch Farm was founded in 1914 at the beginning of World War I. It survived the dust bowl of the 1930s, fluctuating crop prices, and many other harsh conditions that have dev-astated other Colorado farms over the past decade. As a family, the Kochs were able to persevere, keeping their family’s traditions and the farm alive. It’s through the hard work and determination of family members like John and Conrad Wyss, the founders of the farm; Mark Koch, the current operator of the farm, and his siblings; and their father, John Koch, who passed away earlier this year, that this farm continues to thrive today. Mr. Speaker, I am immensely proud of the family tradition and determination that the Koch Family Farm embodies. I congratulate the Koch Family Farm for receiving the distinct honor of being designated as a part of the Colorado Department of Agriculture and His-tory homestead collection. The Koch family truly deserves this honor. f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF OFFICER MIKE BRUNSON 
HON. BARBARA COMSTOCK 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 19, 2016 Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of my constituent, Officer Mi-chael ‘‘Mike’’ Todd Brunson, a master police officer in the Winchester Police Department. Officer Brunson passed away on September 11th, 2016 at the age of 48. He will be sorely missed by his family, his fellow officers, and his entire community. Mike Brunson was sworn into the Win-chester Police Department on February 10, 1995 and was promoted to the position of Master Police Officer in September of 2006. Officer Brunson was a respected and well known member of our community. In addition to protecting his neighbors, Mike helped found his department’s community policing unit, and even served as a counselor at the Kids and Cops Camp. Officer Brunson was a member of the SWAT Team, a firearms instructor and field training officer. He also received a Meri-torious Action Award and a Valor Award in 2014 for risking his life to enter a burning home in search for a 2 year old boy. Winchester Police Chief Kevin Sanzenbacher in his statement said that Mike ‘‘was a great person, a great father, grand-father, husband, son and friend. He will be truly missed.’’ Lt. J. Cornwell of the Frederick County Sheriffs Office had Officer Brunson as his first field training officer and said ‘‘he was a very courteous and nice man who was al-ways willing to pass on information that he had’’ and that it was a ‘‘shame to lose him, es-pecially at that young age.’’ Officer Mike Brunson is survived by his mother, Carol D. Rockwell, his wife, Kimberly Brunson; his daughter Elizabeth Thurman and her husband Jesse, his daughter Katherine Brunson; a step-daughter, Eve Neal, and step-son, Ste-phen Neal-Crowe; as well as his two grand-children Ryleigh Grace and Oliver James Thurman. Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in celebrating the life of Officer Michael ‘‘Mike’’ Todd Brunson. May he rest in peace, and his family be comforted.

HONORING BOB M CFADDEN IN THE DALLES, OREGON 
HON. GREG WALDEN 
OF OREGON  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 19, 2016 Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my good friend Bob McFadden for his many years of dedicated public service to the Port of The Dalles. Bob has retired after serving 11 years as commissioner and the last two years as President for the Port of The Dalles, and I would like to pay tribute to his leadership for the people of The Dalles. Bob was born near Mollala, Oregon and graduated from Portland’s Parkrose High School. Following graduation, Bob studied cul-inary arts and the hospitality industry at the Horst Mager Culinary Institute before begin-ning a career in culinary work and hotel man-agement for Holiday Inn in the Portland area. During his tenure with the hotel industry, he met a fellow Parkrose High graduate, Kris, who would become his wife of 42 years. They would go on together to work in the Houston, Texas area before receiving an offer to man-age a hotel in The Dalles and so the two moved their new family to The Dalles in 1982. After arriving in The Dalles, Bob began his real estate career as well as his time as an Oregon athletics official for high school football and basketball. His career as a referee in the Mid-Columbia region also included service as basketball and football commissioner and the peer awarded State Football Referee of the Year. Being a family man with a business to oper-ate is a difficult and time consuming role in itself. In addition to being a great father, suc-cessful realtor, and a reliable referee for the region’s student athletes, Bob found even more time to give to his community in a num-ber of roles including membership and presi-dency of The DaIles Rotary and Lions Clubs, serving on the Mid-Columbia Fire and Rescue Board, North Wasco County School District Budget Committee, and a term on The Dalles City Council. Bob and Kris also helped estab-lish the long time sister city program with Miyoshi City, Japan that regularly sends citi-zens abroad and brings citizens of Miyoshi City to The DaIles to better promote under-standing and exchange in the global commu-nity. Bob’s service with The Port of The DaIles began in 2003, where he served as commis-sioner until 2014 when he was elected Presi-dent, a position he held until his retirement at the end of June. During his term, he has been an integral part of the economic driver that is The Port of The DaIles. Despite the progres-sive loss of major job creators over the years, The Port commission has managed to work with the community to create fruitful ideas to bring new jobs into the area. As a member of the Port’s Community Outreach Team, I knew I could count on Bob to provide valuable in-sight in crafting solutions to the issues facing The DaIles and Wasco County. As Bob begins his transition into retirement, I know he and Kris will look forward to more time together. Mr. Speaker and my colleagues, please join me in recognizing and thanking my good friend, Bob McFadden for his many years of leadership and service to The Dalles. f

2013, when she first started them with her ‘‘breast friend’’ Michelle Batt. The success of these events has helped raise awareness and spread knowledge on the subject of breast cancer. Their hard work exemplifies the caring attitude of Loudoun County’s residents. The 2016 Breast Friend event will entail dis-cussion with a panel of doctors who are work-ing in fields related to breast cancer, as well as Ms. Clark’s own story about her experience with breast cancer. The overall mission of Ms. Clark and the Breast Friends team is to pro-vide support to a community of women suf-fering from breast cancer. I believe that it is important to continue working to help defeat breast cancer; while also supporting those organizations and pro-grams such as Breast Friends that do so much for those already suffering from this dis-ease. These events serve a vital role in the continued education of our community about diseases such as breast cancer, and in the creation of support networks for those affected by it. It is my hope that this event will endure into the future and continue this legacy of commu-nity support and awareness. I thank and com-mend everyone involved in the 2016 Breast Friends event. Their caring spirit will result in critically important issues being discussed to a greater degree in our society. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join in recognizing Ms. Nicole Clark of Loudoun County for her work as host of the 2016 Breast Friends event in Hamilton, Virginia. Al-though Michelle Batt will not be in the country for this year’s event, she will continue to be an integral part of the important work done by the Breast Friends in our great Commonwealth. I commend both Nicole and Michelle for their continued dedication to supporting those suf-fering from breast cancer. I wish them all the best in their future endeavors.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 19, 2016 Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life and legacy of Mrs. Brenda Faye Young Russell, who sadly passed away on Saturday, March 12, 2016. Brenda attended North Carolina A&T State University and received a Bachelor of Science Degree in Economics and Business Adminis-tration in 1969. After receiving her degree, she embarked upon a career in business by secur-ing a position as an economist at The Rouse Company in Columbia, Maryland. In 1975. Brenda married Mr. Daniel Russell, who was also employed by the Company. Later in her career, Mrs. Russell worked as a merchandising manager and developed sev-eral retail businesses through Maryland. Ulti-mately, she created Russell-Turcot and Com-pany, a real estate development and con-sulting firm. Her talents and expertise sur-passed the retail and consulting industries, and extended to community leadership. Mrs. Russell served her community by assuming the position of Acting President for the Wash-ington Urban League. In recognition of her outstanding contribu-tions to small business and society, Mrs. Rus-sell was honored by the Metropolitan Demo-cratic Women’s Club and received the Mayor Marion Barry Award for ‘‘Exemplary Business Achievement’’ in the retail industry in 1983. In-deed, the Washington Post described Mrs. Brenda Russell as ‘‘the walking embodiment of a successful retailer.’’ Mr. Speaker, I am honored to pay my re-spects to Brenda and her family. She is sur-vived by her husband, Daniel Russell; her daughter, Doni Kristen; and many others who grew to love and cherish her. I offer my deep-est condolences to Brenda’s family. Her spirit, loving memory, and legacy will always live on. f

CELEBRATING THE 100TH ANNI-VERSARY OF EL PASO HIGH SCHOOL 
HON. BETO O’ROURKE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 19, 2016 Mr. O’ROURKE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and celebrate the 100th Anniversary of El Paso High School (EPHS). September 18, 2016 marks the 100th anni-versary of El Paso’s oldest operating high school, El Paso High. During these 100 years, the ‘‘Lady on the Hill’’ has played an influential role in defining the best of our community and country. El Paso High has a long and proud history of service. In the early 1900’s El Paso High School’s first Texas Cadet Guard became one of the first Junior Reserve Officers Training Corps (JROTC) in the United States. She has prepared notable officers like William D. Haw-kins, an El Paso High JROTC alumnus and Medal of Honor recipient of the U.S. Marine Corps, after whom the U.S.S. Hawkins was named. In 1925, an airfield on the U.S. Army’s installation at Fort Bliss was named after James Buster Biggs, another EPHS graduate who was killed in a plane crash at Beltran, France in 1918. El Paso High School also represents the best of our country’s connection with the rest of the hemisphere. Located just three miles from the U.S.-Mexico border, EPHS is 93 per-cent Hispanic, and has implemented a nation-ally recognized Dual Language Gifted and Tal-ented Program. Also known as Mundos Unidos, or Connecting Worlds, the unique pro-gram was awarded the multi-million dollar Jacob K. Javits Grant from the U.S. Depart-ment of Education. The program has helped EPHS graduates to receive top scholarships at the top universities. Innovation and creativity flourish here. F. Murray Abraham, a 1958 graduate, began his acting career at El Paso High School. His tal-ent won him a drama scholarship to the Texas Western College, and later an Academy Award for Best Actor in the film Amadeus. Jim Ward and Cedric Bixler-Zavala, best known for their collaboration in the groundbreaking band At the Drive-In, are both proud Tigers. Another accomplished El Paso High grad-uate, Tom Lea, moved the nation through his art, writing, and war-time correspondence. Lea brought the Southwestern region to life in his famous murals that can be found in public buildings from Washington, D.C. to Dallas, Texas. Mr. Lea also worked as an eyewitness correspondent for Life Magazine, where he traveled more than 100,000 miles to record the experiences of U.S. and Allied officers in World War II. He wrote and illustrated The Brave Bulls and The Wonderful Country, which were later adapted into Hollywood mov-ies. Ruben Salazar, a pioneer journalist during the 1960’s Chicano movement, was the first Mexican-American to cover the Chicano com-munity in mainstream media. His news cov-erage included police discrimination against Mexican-Americans, Chicano protests, and the relations between Chicanos and African Amer-icans. On August 29, 1970, Salazar covered the Chicano Moratorium anti-war protest in East Los Angeles, the largest Mexican-Amer-ican rally in U.S. history. Sheriff’s deputies and officers wielded clubs and fired tear gas at protestors in the area, hitting and instantly kill-ing Salazar. His unfortunate death and fear-less character has made him a civil rights leader for our country. Abraham, Lea, and Salazar are among the many high-skilled, gift-ed minds El Paso High has produced. Our city’s oldest high school has exceptionally pre-pared some of our nation’s best visionaries. The beauty of El Paso High School lies not only within its students, but with its architec-ture as well. In 1980, El Paso High became an official historic landmark in the National Reg-ister of Historic Places. Its unique Greco- Roman architecture was inspired by the Por-tico of Octavia in Rome, Italy. Henry Trost, the chief architect, designed the school and some of the most unique buildings in the Southwest. Mr. Speaker, I ask the House of Represent-atives to rise with me to honor El Paso High School and the extraordinary work they have

IN HONOR OF THE COMMEMORA-TION OF THE 1861 BATTLE OF DRANESVILLE 
HON. BARBARA COMSTOCK 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 19, 2016 Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I would like to honor the Commemoration of the 1861 Bat-tle of Dranesville on Saturday, September 24th. The battle marked the first time Union forces defeated the Confederacy in the east-ern theatre. On December 20th, 1861, Brigadier General Edward Ord, leading the Union forces, en-gaged the Confederate army under the com-mand of Brigadier General J.E.B. Stuart at the village of Dranesville, Virginia. The Union force of 5,000 men was attacked by 4.000 Confederate soldiers along the Leesburg Pike. Due to their superior position, Union artillery was able to out-duel their Confederate coun-terparts while the infantry forces squared off. After two hours of fighting, the Confederate army retreated from the field. The Union vic-tory provided a much needed morale boost during America’s most deadly war. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the Commemoration of the 1861 Battle of Dranesville. We must always remember and honor those who sacrificed their lives to preserve our nation.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE FRIENDS OF THE CLAUDE MOORE COLO-NIAL FARM AT TURKEY RUN 
HON. BARBARA COMSTOCK 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 19, 2016 Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize The Friends of the Claude Moore Colonial Farm at Turkey Run in Fairfax Coun-ty, Virginia for their support of this educational farm throughout the years. This society has been integral in the continued operations of this park site, which serves as a historical ref-erence to colonial farm life for the citizens of Fairfax County and for visitors from around the country. The Friends of the Claude Moore Colonial Farm at Turkey Run hosts their annual Okto-berfest fundraising event, which has live enter-tainment and a myriad of other activities. The Claude Moore Colonial Farm at Turkey Run has been open for over 40 years, and has been the only privately funded and operated park in the National Park System for the past 35 years. This park site offers many learning experiences for its visitors to be immersed in the authentic methods of colonial agriculture. Agriculture continues to be a vital force in my district as well as the nation as a whole, and I would like to applaud this group’s dedi-cation to maintaining an establishment that celebrates our nation’s farming heritage. The Claude Moore Colonial Farm at Turkey Run is a wonderful destination for many students and young people to learn about our country’s his-tory and develop a greater appreciation for those men and woman who laid the founda-tion of the United States of America. Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in recognizing The Friends of the Claude Moore Colonial Farm at Turkey Run for their valuable efforts to preserve one of our nation’s great parks. I wish them all the best at their upcoming Oktoberfest event and in their future endeavors. f

HON. BARBARA COMSTOCK 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 19, 2016 Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I would like to honor the 5th anniversary of Sprout Thera-peutic Riding and Education Center in Aldie, Virginia. The center provides equine assisted activities and therapies for those seeking op-portunities for personal growth. With seven horses and a dedicated staff, the center seeks to raise awareness about special needs while providing a dynamic envi-ronment for participants to learn and socialize. Their riding lessons focus on gaining riding skills, increasing physical strength, and achieving the rider’s desired social, emotional, and life skills. Their work is an inspiration and I am proud to have such a wonderful organi-zation in the Virginia’s 10th Congressional Dis-trict. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join in recognizing the 5th anniversary of Sprout Therapeutic Riding and Education Center and thanking all those who provide comfort and support to our neighbors in need. I know the center will continue to provide excellent oppor-tunities for any who wish to partake. I wish them all the best in their future endeavors.
