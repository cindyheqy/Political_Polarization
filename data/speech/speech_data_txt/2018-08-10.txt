PRAYER Reverend Alisa Lasater Wailoo, Cap-itol Hill United Methodist Church, Washington, D.C., offered the following prayer: Let us join with the Psalm writer who prays, ‘‘Out of the depths I cry to You, O Lord.’’ Lord, we cry out to You today from the depths of our blessings. We thank You for this great land, the leaders of this Chamber, their tireless staffs, and the gorgeous array of people that make up America. Lord, we cry out today aware of fires raging around our Nation. We pray for the people of California and the coura-geous firefighters. Rain down Your mercy and fan in us a passion to care for the land and all who live upon it. Lord, we also cry out to You from the depths of the pain and division in our country. Free us from our own biases and extinguish any hate so Your bridge-building love can blaze brightly in us. Finally, Lord, we cry out for all who are home in their districts this month. Refresh their passion to serve, and help them, like Moses, see the burning bushes in their midst, places where You call us to hear the suffering of Your people and respond with life- changing leadership. May it be so for each of us. Amen. f

IN MEMORY OF FORMER U.S. SEN-ATOR AND GOVERNOR PAUL LAXALT OF NEVADA 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, August 10, 2018 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the memory of former Nevada Sen-ator and Governor Paul Laxalt. Mr. Laxalt passed away this past Monday in McLean, Virginia. A child of immigrants and a Nevada native from Carson City, he served our nation with distinction in the Pacific during the Second World War. He applied himself to serving his commu-nity, first as a district attorney in 1950, then as Lieutenant Governor in 1962. After winning the governorship of Nevada in 1968, he stabilized the state’s gambling indus-try from the grips of organized crime and de-veloped a system of community colleges. Mr. Laxalt is perhaps best remembered as President Reagan’s campaign chairman and the moderate Republican Senator from Ne-vada. But he was above all a man who cared deeply for the nation, which he served with dignity and integrity. Former Senator Harry Reid, whom Mr. Lax-alt defeated in 1974 when Senator Reid was the state’s lieutenant governor, and who suc-ceeded him in the Senate in 1987, said of Mr. Laxalt, ‘‘We have been political adversaries all my adult life, but he and I are friends.’’ Though they disagreed on many policy issues, Senator Reid added, he viewed Mr. Laxalt as a man of utmost integrity in the Sen-ate. Mr. Speaker, I therefore pay tribute today not only to Paul Laxalt’s honorable life of serv-ice, but also to the spirit of upholding integrity over bitter ideological entrenchment. The life and story of Mr. Laxalt—his dedica-tion to country over party, to the public over self, and to the greater good over personal gain—is certainly a model of conduct for those who seek to lead this nation. I urge my colleagues, in memory of this statesman of integrity, to work to recover our sense of civility and work toward mending our differences for the common good.

OFFSHORE WIND FOR TERRITORIES ACT 
HON. MADELEINE Z. BORDALLO 
OF GUAM  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, August 10, 2018 Ms. BORDALLO. Mr. Speaker, today I intro-duce the ‘‘Offshore Wind for Territories Act,’’ which would authorize wind energy develop-ment off the coasts of all 5 U.S. territories. I thank my colleagues—Resident Commis-sioner G
ONZA´LEZ-COLO´Nfrom Puerto Rico, Congresswoman RADEWAGEN from American Samoa, and Congressman S
OTO from Flor-ida—for their support as original cosponsors. Guam and the other territories remain heav-ily reliant on costly imports of foreign-refined petroleum for electricity generation and trans-portation fuel. Electricity usage and costs for territorial resi-dents are nearly twice the national average, while at the same time our median household incomes are less than half that of the main-land United States. As such, reducing the territories’ depend-ence on costly foreign fuel imports with do-mestically produced offshore wind energy should be a priority for Congress, and some-thing everybody can support. Current federal law does not authorize off-shore development in the Exclusive Economic Zone around U.S. territories, which extends 200 nautical miles seaward from our coast-lines. This oversight precludes potentially viable offshore wind projects near Guam and other U.S. territories from moving forward or even getting started. To rectify this problem, my bill would amend the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to in-clude American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, as well as our respective Exclu-sive Economic Zones. Further, my bill would direct the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management to complete a feasibility study on the offshore wind develop-ment potential for each territory, issue a call for information to gauge commercial interest, and offer wind lease sales as appropriate. The wind lease scoping and sale process outlined by my bill mirrors the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management’s existing process for other forms of offshore development. Any offshore wind project in the territories must be sited appropriately, which is why my bill would ensure that the governors of each territory are consulted throughout this process. My bill also requires consultation with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and the U.S. Department of Defense. My late husband, our former Governor Ricky Bordallo, proposed powering Guam with wind and solar energy during the 1970s and 1980s. Now decades later, his vision may soon be realized. Importantly, my bill would guarantee each territory a state-equivalent share of all royalty payments made to the federal government by offshore wind developers for projects in our re-spective Exclusive Economic Zones. The royalty revenue-sharing under my bill is the same as that which current federal law provides for the states of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama from offshore devel-opment in the Gulf of Mexico. My bill would also direct a portion of federal royalties collected to support the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Coral Reef Conservation Program. This will provide dedicated funding for coral reef conservation in U.S. territories and else-where, at no additional cost to American tax-payers. In addition to improving self-reliance and lowering electricity costs, my bill would ensure that offshore wind development in federal waters provides a direct, economic benefit to adjacent U.S. territories. Given that land is limited, offshore wind de-velopment has enormous potential for our is-lands. Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting the ‘‘Offshore Wind for Terri-tories Act.’’

JOURNEY OF HOPE CYCLISTS 
HON. KEVIN YODER 
OF KANSAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, August 10, 2018 Mr. YODER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Journey of Hope cyclists riding over 4,000 miles across the country this sum-mer to raise awareness for people living with disabilities. In 1987, one man’s dream of riding his bike across the country inspired the largest fra-ternal fundraising and awareness event of its kind, the Journey of Hope. Today, the Journey of Hope consists of three cross-country routes covering 32 dif-ferent states and over 12,000 miles that con-verge upon the U.S. Capitol here in Wash-ington. On a typical day, the cyclists ride over 75 miles. However, their day is far from over. The remainder of their days are spent visiting local groups that support people with disabilities and volunteering in the community. Next week, the three Journey of Hope teams will arrive at our nation’s Capital having raised over $665,000 for the disabled. Mr. Speaker, I call upon all of us in this body to join with me in thanking the Journey of Hope cyclists for their service to the dis-abled community.

HONORING COUNCILMAN GLEN LARUE 
HON. JIM BANKS 
OF INDIANA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, August 10, 2018 Mr. BANKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Whitley County Councilman Glen Larue. For 20 years, Councilman Larue has represented Columbia Township. Addition-ally, Glen has served as dispatcher for the Whitley County Sheriff’s Department and as a Columbia City volunteer fireman. I had the honor of serving with Councilman Larue in 2009 and 2010 and I saw firsthand his dedica-tion and commitment to public service. I wish him the best as he begins the next chapter of his life. Whitley County and Columbia Town-ship will miss his leadership and commitment to public service.

CATCHER’S UNIVERSITY BASE-BALL 12U FINISHES SECOND AT THE 2018 NATIONS WORLD SE-RIES 
HON. PETE OLSON 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, August 10, 2018 Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Catcher’s University Baseball 12U team from Katy, TX for winning second place at the 2018 Nations World Series. Catcher’s University Baseball 12U team, under the coaching of head manager Rick Ruff, capped off a season of 34 wins, 9 losses and 2 ties with a second place finish at the 2018 Nations World Series. Team members T.K. Rollins, Blake Davila, Tanner Reese, Ty Garrett, Myles Jackson, Jackson Cleveland, Pablo Lazcano Jr., Jose DeJongh, Christian Jaquay, Kaden Reising, O.D.

On behalf of the Twenty-Second Congres-sional District of Texas, congratulations again to Catcher’s University Baseball 12U team from Katy, TX for winning second place at the 2018 Nations World Series. I look forward to seeing what y’all accomplish in the future on and off the field.

TRIBUTE TO PATRICIA LOWDEN 
HON. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM 
OF NEW MEXICO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, August 10, 2018 Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratu-late Patricia Lowden of Acoma Pueblo in New Mexico for her role in the Pueblo Pottery Mug project and her success as a Native artist. The Pueblo Pottery Mug project started as a collaboration between five Pueblo artists and the first Pueblo-owned Starbucks in New Mex-ico. The mugs were first sold in 2016 at the Starbucks store in Albuquerque. Each mug was hand-crafted by a different Pueblo artist to celebrate the opening of the new store and to symbolize the collaboration between New Mexico Pueblos and Starbucks. After quickly selling out of the unique mugs—selling over 6,000 mugs—the Shumakolowa gift shop col-laborated with the artists to sell mugs at their location in the Indian Pueblo Cultural Center. Patricia was born into a family of potters from the Big Sun and Eagle clan of Acoma Pueblo. She learned the art of pottery at fif-teen years old from the three generations of potters that came before her. Patricia uses tra-ditional methods to create her pottery, which entails soaking chunks of clay that have been carefully selected, then drying and grinding the chunks of clay into powder. Patricia is known for her famed Anasazi re-vival black-on-white and traditional Acoma or-ange, black, and white polychrome style pot-tery. Her work features modern interpretations of traditional Acoma symbols such as rain, clouds, mountains, and rain parrots. Mr. Speaker, I applaud Patricia Lowden for being a part of the Pueblo Pottery Mug project. This project has given the community, as well as visitors to New Mexico, an oppor-tunity to appreciate usable pieces of art that are inspired by Native culture and traditions. I look forward to seeing this project continue to flourish and support talented Native artists from Pueblos throughout New Mexico. f 
HONORING KEVIN J. KEEFE 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, August 10, 2018 Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask the House of Representatives to join me in recognizing Kevin J. Keefe for his 31 years of outstanding federal service, including as a civilian attorney for the Department of the Navy (DON) Office of the General Counsel (OGC). In May 1987, Mr. Keefe was first appointed to federal service as an Attorney Advisor with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commis-sion (EEOC) Office of Review and Appeals, where he remained until 1989. He went on to serve as Assistant Counsel at DON OGC from 1989 to 1995, and as Senior Advisor in the Executive Office for United States Attorneys at the Department of Justice (DOJ) from 1995 to 1998. Mr. Keefe returned to DON OGC in 1998 as Supervisory Associate Counsel for the Strategic Systems Program (SSP), where he spent the last 20 years representing DON in various roles. Kevin J. Keefe quickly established himself for his great foresight in anticipating and eval-uating legal issues, particularly in considering potential future implications for the DON. Throughout his tenure, Mr. Keefe earned and maintained the trust of senior leaders at SSP with his superb legal acumen and was well- known for his thorough litigation work. Mr. Keefe has secured numerous favorable deci-sions from the EEOC and the Merit Systems Protection Board on behalf of DON in his cen-tral practice area of civilian personnel law. Moreover, he has assisted the U.S. Attorney’s office in representing DON when SSP per-sonnel cases were appealed to the federal District Court or to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In these instances, U.S. attorneys relied on motions and briefs drafted by Mr. Keefe to prevail in federal court. Kevin J. Keefe’s achievements have been celebrated throughout his career with a variety of awards for his outstanding work in the fed-eral government. These include the DON Mer-itorious Civilian Service Award, a DOJ Special Achievement Award, a Letter of Recognition from the Director of SSP and other perform-ance-related accolades. Mr. Speaker, I ask the House of Represent-atives to join me in recognizing Kevin J. Keefe, on the occasion of his retirement, for his many years of excellence in federal serv-ice.

UALR BIKE-SHARING PROGRAM 
HON. J. FRENCH HILL 
OF ARKANSAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, August 10, 2018 Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recog-nize the University of Arkansas-Little Rock’s new bike-sharing program and to emphasize its leading example of advocacy for active life-styles. I appreciate the efforts of Jim Carr, Chair for the University’s Committee on Sustainability, who lead the initiative to bring the bike share program to the Little Rock campus. This program has provided students, faculty, staff, and visitors a convenient and healthy way to get around campus. Nearly 200 bright-orange bikes have been delivered to UA-Little Rock and have been placed near high-traffic areas, such as dor-mitories and Ottenheimer Library. As a long-time biker, I am pleased to see the campus work to provide an alternative and convenient transportation option to relieve congestion and promote a healthier campus. As a former board member of Bicycles Ad-vocacy of Central Arkansas, I am glad to see UA-Little Rock’s bike-sharing program as one more step on the path to a more vibrant, healthy, and bike-friendly community. f 
IN RECOGNITION OF THE SAMUEL U. RODGERS HEALTH CENTER’S 50TH YEAR OF SERVICE 
HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER 
OF MISSOURI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, August 10, 2018 Mr. CLEAVER. Mr. Speaker, I proudly rise today to recognize and celebrate 50 years of service from the Samuel U. Rodgers Health Center. This milestone embodies the vision Dr. Samuel U. Rodgers had for a foundation that would provide families with affordable health care. With over four decades of service Dr. Rogers’ health center has been respon-sible for providing cost effective and quality health care to thousands of families in Mis-souri’s Fifth Congressional District. Dr. Samuel U. Rodgers’ passion for serving low income families can be traced back to his early days in Kansas City when he first arrived as an intern for a then-segregated general hospital. During this time Dr. Rodgers wit-nessed firsthand the challenges minority and low-income families faced while trying to ac-cess quality and affordable health care. This experience would inspire him to go on to be-come the first African American OBGYN in Kansas City, and then later, the first African American to open a successful all-black med-ical practice. Dr. Rodgers’ commitment to en-suring that all people, regardless of their eth-nicity or economic background, receive afford-able health care would later inspire him to open Missouri’s first federally-recognized health center, the Samuel U. Rodgers Health Center. When Dr. Rodgers opened his health cen-ter, he did so with the intent to serve both indi-viduals and families who otherwise would not be able to afford quality healthcare. Moreover, Dr. Rodgers emphasized the need to also pro-vide patients access to resources that help maintain their long-term health. Today, there are five Samuel U. Rodgers Health Centers located throughout the Greater Kansas City area. Each one continues Dr. Rodgers’ legacy of compassion and equitable health care for all. The Samuel U. Rodgers Health Centers offer a variety of services that range from dental care to behavioral health

services. As fundamental pillars of the com-munity, these health centers strengthen and contribute to the prosperity of my district and I have no doubt that Dr. Rodgers would be proud to see the sustained success of his vi-sion. Healthcare is one of the most critical factors a community needs to prosper. The Samuel U. Rodgers Health Center is truly a blueprint when it comes to demonstrating the power of arming communities with the access and re-sources necessary to maintain their health. It is a privilege to stand today and recognize the half-century of service of the Samuel U. Rodgers Health Center. Mr. Speaker, please join me in thanking and honoring the Samuel U. Rodgers Health Center for selflessly serv-ing families across the Greater Kansas City area for 50 years.

CONGRATULATING GRACE SEIBOLDT ON WINNING THREE MEDALS AT THE 2018 SPECIAL OLYMPICS USA GAMES 
HON. PETER J. ROSKAM 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, August 10, 2018 Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to recognize Grace Seiboldt, an ex-ceptionally talented young woman from the Sixth District of Illinois. Grace recently com-peted for Team Illinois in the 2018 Special Olympics USA National Games where she won two gold medals and one silver medal. Grace started swimming when she was just five years old and began competing in the Special Olympics in 2007. After competing for the last 11 years at the state level, she quali-fied along with 46 Special Olympic athletes from Illinois to compete in the Special Olym-pics USA National Games. Grace joined with more than 4,000 athletes and coaches from across the United States in Seattle for the games and was incredibly successful. She earned gold medals in the 200 individual med-ley and the 4 × 100 medley relay, where she swam the butterfly leg. She also received a silver medal for her performance in the 400 freestyle. This is an incredible feat for some-one competing at her first National Games. Grace’s prowess as an elite swimmer has not gone unnoticed. Her skills caught the eye of an assistant coach with the USA Paralympics, and she was invited to attend the national training camp in September at the University of Delaware. If chosen, Grace will join with 7,000 athletes from around the world to compete at the Special Olympics World Games in Abu Dhabi next March. This is a great honor and I have no doubt Grace would make the United States proud. Mr. Speaker and my Distinguished Col-leagues, please join me in recognizing Grace Seiboldt for her remarkable achievements and all the best in her future endeavors. RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF MR. VALENTINE ‘‘ROCK’’ GRUNDMAN HON. WILL HURD 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, August 10, 2018 Mr. HURD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to rec-ognize the incredible contributions and life of Mr. Valentine ‘‘Rock’’ Grundman of San Anto-nio, Texas. Rock’s service to the United States began in 1957 when he received a commission as an Air Force Judge Advocate General Officer. From there, he served as counsel at the Fed-eral Trade Commission, and as an advisor to Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, and George W. Bush. Throughout his career, Rock Grundman re-mained active in the military, retiring as a Lieutenant Colonel in 1992. During this serv-ice, he successfully defended the Secretaries of the Army and the Air Force in the first anti-trust case brought against the U.S. Govern-ment. For these efforts, he received the Meri-torious Service Medal in 1980. While serving in the Air Force Reserves, Rock also served as Adjunct Faculty at the University of Texas at Dallas Graduate Business School. Rock Grundman lived a life of public service that extended well beyond his career and mili-tary service. He was a member of the vestry and senior warden for St. William Laud Epis-copal Church and President of the Pittsburg Rotary Club. His leadership and service to his community are truly a testament to the char-acter and spirit of Texas’s 23rd Congressional District. Rock Grundman passed away on June 13, 2018, leaving behind an extraordinary legacy and family. While we mourn the loss of Rock, his reputation and the values he represented will live on through his family, his friends, and community. I would like to extend my most sincere condolences to Mr. Grundman’s family during this difficult time and am proud to rec-ognize all that he did for the great state of Texas and the United States of America.

TRIBUTE TO MARTHA ROMERO 
HON. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM 
OF NEW MEXICO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, August 10, 2018 Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratu-late Martha Romero of Nambe´Pueblo in New Mexico for her role in the Pueblo Pottery Mug project and her success as a Native artist. The Pueblo Pottery Mug project started as a collaboration between five Pueblo artists and the first Pueblo-owned Starbucks in New Mex-ico. The mugs were first sold in 2016 at the Starbucks store in Albuquerque. Each mug was hand-crafted by a different Pueblo artist to celebrate the opening of the new store and to symbolize the collaboration between New Mexico Pueblos and Starbucks. After quickly selling out of the unique mugs—selling over 6,000 mugs—the Shumakolowa gift shop col-laborated with the artists to sell mugs at their location in the Indian Pueblo Cultural Center. Martha learned the practices of pottery-mak-ing from her mother, Rosa Alice Baca. After taking a hiatus from pottery, she took up the work once again, an experience which helped her reconnect to an art form closely tied to her Pueblo, tradition, culture, and mother. In the words of Martha, ‘‘I am spiritually awakened when creating pottery! It brings me closer to my mother who has completed the circle. In relearning what she taught me, I find a con-nection to my mother and our beloved Nambe´.’’ Martha’s unique unpainted pieces dem-onstrate the clay’s natural shine and have a beautiful connection with her Indian name Kwahtenbay, which means rainbow. Using hand-gathered micaceous clay and traditional coiling methods, she crafts simple yet elegant designs that echo traditional utilitarian Nambe ´ techniques. Mr. Speaker, I applaud Martha Romero for being a part of the Pueblo Pottery Mug project. This project has given the community, as well as visitors to New Mexico, an oppor-tunity to appreciate usable pieces of art that are inspired by Native culture and traditions. I look forward to seeing this project continue to flourish and support talented Native artists from Pueblos throughout New Mexico. f 
CELEBRATING IDYLLWILD’S TWENTY-FIFTH ANNUAL ‘‘JAZZ IN THE PINES’’ 
HON. RAUL RUIZ 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, August 10, 2018 Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to rec-ognize Idyllwild’s ‘‘Jazz in the Pines’’ festival, a celebration of music, art, and community in my congressional district. Jazz in the Pines is one of my family’s fa-vorite traditions. It’s a chance to marvel at the handiwork of local artists, catch up with friends, and listen to the sweet, sweet sounds of smooth jazz. Every year, we join our neigh-bors in the San Jacinto Mountains to celebrate the natural and cultural beauty that makes Idyllwild unlike any other place on earth. The proceeds of this yearly celebration ben-efit the Idyllwild Arts, a foundation that teaches adults and children of all ages to realize and develop their artistic talent. Through summer camps and college preparatory courses, Idyllwild Arts is enriching the lives of students from Idyllwild and across the country. This year’s Jazz in the Pines is particularly special. Not only does it mark the festival’s twenty-fifth year—it comes in the wake of and in spite of the largest wildfire to threaten the community of Idyllwild in nearly five years. The Cranston fire burned more than 13,000 acres, destroying buildings, closing major roads, and forcing thousands from their homes. But no matter how large the fire grew, our mountain community’s passion for cele-brating music and the arts burned brighter. We owe this year’s festival to the incredible first responders who risked their lives to pro-tect Idyllwild, Pine Cove, Mountain Center, Fern Valley, and many surrounding commu-nities. I am also grateful to the hundreds of musicians, artists, and volunteers who made this year’s event possible. Jazz in the Pines was born from conversa-tions around a kitchen table. Today, it dem-onstrates what we can achieve when neigh-bors, local businesses, and non-profits work

OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, August 10, 2018 Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and celebrate the opening of Habitat for Humanity’s new Thousand Islands Area Re-Store. Habitat for Humanity has a long history of serving Jefferson and Lewis counties by pro-viding affordable housing to those in need. In order to continue its mission, Habitat for Hu-manity is expanding its services to a new Re-Store in Watertown, New York. At this loca-tion, Habitat for Humanity will sell furniture, appliances, home accessories, building mate-rials and more for an affordable price. Habitat for Humanity’s ability to offer these goods and services at the ReStore is made possible by the hard work of volunteers and donors throughout the community. By working on be-half of their neighbors, the volunteers of Habi-tat for Humanity continue to enrich the North Country community. On behalf of New York’s 21st District, I want to thank Habitat for Humanity and its volun-teers for providing an invaluable service to the North Country. We are grateful for Habitat for Humanity’s commitment to this region, and look forward to the benefits that the ReStore will provide for years to come.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 100TH AN-NIVERSARY OF NICHOLS, WIS-CONSIN 
HON. MIKE GALLAGHER 
OF WISCONSIN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, August 10, 2018 Mr. GALLAGHER. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to acknowledge the 100th Anniversary of Nich-ols, Wisconsin. On September 8, 2018, Nich-ols will mark this event through its planned Centennial Celebration. The event will focus on the rich history of the village from its incep-tion until today. When Mr. Arthur Nichols first observed the land, he was impressed by the location, be-lieving it to be the perfect place for a modern city. The State Highway, Wolf River, and Wis-consin Northern Railroad running near the town made it a prime location for the develop-ment of a booming city. Mr. Nichols was a dreamer and when he and several of the early settlers purchased the 160 acres, they thought it would become the hub between Green Bay, Appleton, Clintonville, and Shawano. Nichols quickly had running water, sewage treatment, electricity, and even telephone service. Nichols’ infrastructure expanded and a bridge was built over the nearby Shioc River. Despite a small population Nichols spirit was immense and its desire to grow was evident. Early residents worked together to establish a church, school, and businesses like a barber-shop, laundromat, gas station, and grocery store to fill the needs of the community. Growth quickly expanded from infrastructure and business to entertainment. While a foot-ball team some may know started in nearby Green Bay in 1919, Nichols residents started a baseball team in 1922, known as the Nich-ols Nitro’s. Nichols may be small but is a strong and determined community. Building on its found-ers, the generations following those settlers continue that strength, determination, and pride in keeping the founders’ early motto of being ‘‘the street where old friends meet’’. I ask that the Members of the House of Representatives join me in commending the celebration of the centennial anniversary of the Village of Nichols, Wisconsin. A great place where people have been building rela-tionships and stories for the last 100 years. May it continue this fine tradition for many years to come. f 
IN RECOGNITION OF 44TH ANNI-VERSARY OF THE RESIGNATION OF PRESIDENT RICHARD M. NIXON 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, August 10, 2018 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in remembrance of the long national nightmare that ended 44 years ago today when Richard Milhous Nixon addressed the nation from the Oval Office and announced that he would re-sign the office of the Presidency. The next day, August 9, 1974, he submitted his letter of resignation to Henry Kissinger and left for California. In November 1973, long before it was clear that Richard Nixon would be driven from of-fice, the noted historian Arthur Schlesinger ex-plained in his essay, ‘‘The Runaway Presi-dency,’’ why Nixon’s malfeasance was unique, and why it would eventually lead to his down-fall: 
The presidency has been in crisis before; but the constitutional offense that led to the impeachment of Andrew Johnson was trivial compared to the charges now accumulating around the Nixon Administration. There are, indeed, constitutional offenses here but . . . what is unique in the history of the presidency is the long list of potential criminal charges against the Nixon Adminis-tration. 
When the Watergate burglars were arrested in 1972 after breaking into the Democratic Na-tional Committee headquarters in the Water-gate complex in Washington, D.C., White House press secretary Ron Ziegler dismissed the incident as a ‘‘third-rate burglary.’’ The execution of the plot to burglarize the DNC may have been third-rate and amateur-ish, but that was not the essence of the vast criminal enterprise that would become known as ‘‘Watergate.’’ ‘‘Watergate’’ is short-hand for the systemic, calculated effort conceived and managed from the inner circle of the Nixon White House to subvert elections, punish political enemies, un-dermine the media, and mislead the American people. President Nixon obstructed justice from the Oval Office, used the Internal Revenue Serv-ice to go after his political enemies, launched an illegal war in Cambodia, waged dirty tricks against his opponents, kept an ‘‘enemies list,’’ was recorded in the Oval Office describing Jews as ‘‘aggressive, abrasive and obnoxious’’ and Italians as not having their ‘‘heads screwed on tight,’’ had articles of impeach-ment against him approved by the House Ju-diciary Committee, and left a permanent stain on American democracy. In short, President Nixon attempted to sub-vert our democratic institutions and flout the rule of law. America’s democratic institutions, however, are made of sterner stuff, and withstood this assault because in America, no one office or person is above the law. As President Theodore Roosevelt put it so well on December 7, 1903 in his third Annual Address to Congress: ‘‘No man is above the law and no man is below it: nor do we ask any man’s permission when we ask him to obey it.’’ That is why former FBI agent G. Gordon Liddy and former CIA employee James McCord, security director of the Committee to Re-elect the President (CREEP) would be found guilty of conspiracy, burglary and bug-ging DNC headquarters. E. Howard Hunt, a former CIA operative and head of the White House ‘‘Plumbers’’ unit, and four others would plead guilty. In April, White House counsel John Dean, chief of staff H.R. Haldeman, domestic policy chief John D. Ehrlichman, and Attorney Gen-eral Richard Kleindienst resigned amidst the growing scandal. On October 20, 1973, President Nixon or-dered Attorney General Elliot Richardson to fire Special Counsel Archibald Cox, who re-fused, as did Deputy Attorney General William Ruckelshaus. Solicitor General Robert Bork did not refuse and executed Nixon’s order, setting off what is now known as the ‘‘Saturday Night Massacre.’’ In January 1975, several high-ranking Nixon appointees—including H.R. Haldeman, John D. Ehrlichman, and John Mitchell—would be tried, convicted, and sentenced to prison. White House Counsel Charles Colson pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice and served seven months. White House Counsel John Dean pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice and served four months. White House Chief of Staff H.R. Haldeman was convicted of conspiracy and obstruction of justice and served 18 months. In all, more than 40 government officials were indicted or jailed. As we look back on the Nixon resignation and his imperial presidency, it is worthwhile to reflect upon the statements of Congress-woman Barbara Jordan, who held the seat I currently hold, made during a House Judiciary Committee impeachment hearing: 
Common sense would be revolted if we en-gaged upon this process for petty reasons. Congress has a lot to do: Appropriations, tax reform, health insurance, campaign fi-nance reform, housing, environmental pro-tection, energy sufficiency, mass transpor-tation. Pettiness cannot be allowed to stand in the face of such overwhelming problems. So today we are not being petty. We are trying to be big, because the task we have before us is a big one.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD —Extensions of RemarksE1141 August 10, 2018 
Mr. Speaker, the circumstances in which we find ourselves today do not call for pettiness. Nor do they call for twitter politics and spec-tacle. They call for leadership; a recognition that a respect for the rule of law and holding our leaders accountable for their misdeeds is a fundamental democratic responsibility. In August 1974, the vigilant and tireless ef-forts by law enforcement, journalists, and our nation’s leaders led President Nixon to yield to the rule of law. The saving grace of Richard Nixon is that, at the end, he put the interests of the nation ahead of himself by resigning his office. Arthur Schlesinger’s 1973 essay appears prescient in its prediction that ‘‘corruption ap-pears to visit the White House in fifty-year cy-cles.’’ As Professor Schlesinger wrote, ‘‘If the trails are followed to their end, many, many years will pass before another White House staff dares take the liberties with the Constitution and the laws the Nixon White House has taken,’’ which ‘‘suggests that exposure and retribution inoculate the presidency against its latent criminal impulses for about half a cen-tury.’’ Professor Schlesinger also offered a warn-ing that ‘‘corruption appears to visit the White House in fifty-year cycles.’’ Mr. Speaker, on this historic day, let us re-member that Congress is a co-equal branch of government and has a duty to hold the execu-tive accountable for misconduct, abuse of power, and ‘High Crimes and Misdemeanors.’ As Congresswoman Barbara Jordan de-clared: ‘‘My faith in the Constitution is whole; it is complete; it is total. And I am not going to sit here and be an idle spectator to the dim-inution, the subversion, the destruction, of the Constitution.’’ And today, Mr. Speaker, let me affirm that my faith in the Constitution is whole, complete, and total. Our nation is founded on the principle that all are equal under the law, and that one can only delay—never escape—the swift sword of justice. We must always be faithful to the duties im-posed upon us by the Constitution.

CONWAY HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER CRYSTAL CERTAIN 
HON. J. FRENCH HILL 
OF ARKANSAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, August 10, 2018 Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recog-nize the efforts of Crystal Certain, an art teacher at Conway High School, who is com-mitted to making a difference in central Arkan-sas. Crystal partnered with the Community Ac-tion Program of Central Arkansas to provide food to hungry children in our community. She started by funding the project out of her own pocket and the practice grew into a class-room food-pantry project. Her students named it the ‘‘Certain Little Free Class Pantry’’. Nearly 400 children at her school get nour-ishing food from her pantry project. The Community Action Program of Central Arkansas is providing meals during the sum-mer months and is operating the project from inside the agency’s pantry. In addition to providing meals, Crystal also provides students with healthy recipes that they can prepare for themselves. I am proud to represent her and all of the teachers of central Arkansas who are making a difference in the lives of our young people. f 
SUGAR LAND RECEIVES DISTIN-GUISHED BUDGET PRESEN-TATION AWARD 
HON. PETE OLSON

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, August 10, 2018 Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my hometown, the city of Sugar Land, TX for receiving its 22nd consecutive Distinguished Budget Presentation Award for its Fiscal Year 2018 Annual Budget. Sugar Land was recognized for strong finan-cial leadership, transparency initiatives, contin-ued financial resiliency, including fiscally con-servative budgeting and proactive planning.

Independent judges measured Sugar Land’s standing in these four categories and said the budget was ‘‘proficient’’ in all and met or ex-ceeded 14 mandatory criteria. On behalf of the Twenty-Second Congres-sional District of Texas, congratulations again to the city of Sugar Land, TX on receiving its 22nd consecutive Distinguished Budget Award for its Fiscal Year 2018 Annual Budget.

TRIBUTE TO HELEN BIRD 
HON. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM 
OF NEW MEXICO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, August 10, 2018 Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratu-late Helen Bird of Santo Domingo Pueblo in New Mexico for her role in the Pueblo Pottery Mug project and her success as a Native art-ist. The Pueblo Pottery Mug project started as a collaboration between five Pueblo artists and the first Pueblo-owned Starbucks in New Mex-ico. The mugs were first sold in 2016 at the Starbucks store in Albuquerque. Each mug was hand-crafted by a different Pueblo artist to celebrate the opening of the new store and to symbolize the collaboration between New Mexico Pueblos and Starbucks. After quickly selling out of the unique mugs—selling over 6,000 mugs—the Shumakolowa gift shop col-laborated with the artists to sell mugs at their location in the Indian Pueblo Cultural Center. Growing up in the Pueblo of Santo Do-mingo, Helen learned traditional pottery tech-niques from her great-aunt at a very young age and has been making pottery profes-sionally for nearly 30 years. Widely credited as being a profoundly influential figure in revital-izing Santo Domingo pottery, Helen sought to elevate it to an exquisite art form. Helen’s designs come from her Santo Do-mingo heritage. Her elegant pieces are well known for their signature bird designs from pottery found in the Bandelier National Monu-ment. Mr. Speaker, I applaud Helen Bird for being a part of the Pueblo Pottery Mug project. This project has given the community, as well as visitors to New Mexico, an opportunity to ap-preciate usable pieces of art that. are inspired by Native culture and traditions. I look forward to seeing this project continue to flourish and support talented Native artists from Pueblos throughout New Mexico. f 
CELEBRATING THE BIRTH ANNI-VERSARY OF THE 52ND DAI AL MUTLAQ, HIS HOLINESS DR. SYEDNA MOHAMMED BURHANUDDIN RA, AND THE BIRTHDAY OF THE 53RD AND PRESENT DAI AL MUTLAQ, HIS HOLINESS DR. SYEDNA MUFADDAL SAIFUDDIN TUS 
HON. PETER J. ROSKAM 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, August 10, 2018 Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the birth anniversary of the 52nd Dai Al Mutlaq, his holiness Dr. Syedna Moham-med Burhanuddin RA, and the birthday of the 53rd and present Dai Al Mutlaq, his Holiness Dr. Syedna Mufaddal Saifuddin. The Dawoodi Bohras’ patriotism and commitment to the United States and their recognition of Inter-national Women’s Day should serve as an ex-ample for all. The Dawoodi Bohras mostly reside in India, Pakistan, Africa, Europe, USA, South East Asia and Australia. Their name, ‘Bohra’ comes from the Gujarati word ‘vehru’ which means trader; as the community has always main-tained a strong and robust business commu-nity. The late Dr. Syedna Burhanuddin RA had a profound impact on this as he unceasingly encouraged his adherents to start their own business. In addition to fostering a robust business community, the Bohras are loyal and law-abid-ing citizens throughout the world. They have maintained cordial relations with all levels of government with an aim to foster harmony and goodwill. They embrace technology and equal opportunities, and consider patriotism a reli-gious obligation. The Dawoodi Bohras are a sect within Shia Islam and follow the seven pillars of Islamism: guardianship of the faith, purity, prayer, alms-giving, fasting, pilgrimage to Mecca and struggle. Mr. Speaker, and distinguished colleagues, please join me in celebrating the birth anniver-sary of the 52nd Dai Al Mutlaq, his Holiness Dr. Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin RA and the birthday of the 53rd and present Dai Al Mutlaq, his Holiness Dr. Syedna Mufaddal Saifuddin TUS and wishing the Dawoodi Bohras a year of peace and prosperity.

CONGRATULATING CHRIS JEFFERS ON HIS RETIREMENT 
HON. JUDY CHU 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, August 10, 2018 Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Chris Jeffers, a true public servant, on his retirement after a remarkable 38 years serving in local govern-ment. For the past 29 years, Chris has served as City Manager of two San Gabriel Valley cities in my district, Monterey Park and Glendora, where his leadership and dedication have made him a pillar in our communities. As City Manager of my hometown of Monterey Park for 16 years, Chris led an expansion of our li-brary, added hundreds of new housing units for seniors and new residents, and expanded the city’s business and retail space. He chaired the American Communities for Clean-up Equity, a nationwide coalition of local gov-ernments working with the Environmental Pro-tection Agency (EPA), and coordinated devel-opment of the Greater San Gabriel Valley Community Development Corporation, a part-nership of local cities and banks created to in-vest in small business startups. In 2007, Chris accepted the role of City Manager in nearby Glendora. During his ten-ure, the city was named the Los Angeles area’s most business-friendly city under 65,000 residents in 2014 and was twice recog-nized by the Public Technology Institute for its adoption of new technologies to streamline the way that the government interacts with citizens and businesses. Glendora has even been awarded best downtown and friendliest city by the San Gabriel Newspaper Group for four years running, and a survey of local small business owners showed that over 80% found the city to be an excellent place to have a business. Chris’s record speaks for itself, and he is proof of the tremendous impact that one can make through dedication to public service. I thank him for his 38 years of contributions to our communities and wish him nothing but the best in retirement.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, August 10, 2018 Mr. HURD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to rec-ognize Pecos County State Bank on their 90th Anniversary. Pecos County State Bank was first founded by farmers and ranchers on July 3, 1928.

OF KENTUCKY  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, August 10, 2018 Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Magistrate Terry M. Hadley of Adair County in the First District of Kentucky upon his retirement from Duo County Telecom. Over the past 37 years, Terry has devel-oped a well-deserved reputation as an expert technician and loyal employee throughout mul-tiple changes in his company’s ownership. He is known throughout his community of Colum-bia, Kentucky for having an excellent rapport with customers and colleagues alike, and his knowledge and experience made him the first choice for customers in need of assistance with their phone, cable, or internet service. After retirement, Terry Hadley plans to con-tinue serving his community as a magistrate for Adair County, Kentucky. He also looks for-ward to spending time with his wife, Rita Had-ley, and their children and grandchildren and pursuing his interest in collecting antiques, particularly antique cars. I join with Terry’s family and friends, as well as all those he has helped during his career, to express our appreciation for his years of service to his community. I am honored to rep-resent him and wish him well in his retirement.

HONORING THE BRAVERY OF SOUTH TEXAS LAW ENFORCE-MENT OFFICERS 
HON. VICENTE GONZALEZ 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, August 10, 2018 Mr. GONZALEZ of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the bravery of fellow South Texans: Lieutenant Phillip Foley, Officer Lucino Cabrera, Officer Ulysses Guerrero, Of-ficer Alberto Rios-Cantu, and Officer Osiel Reyes of the City of McAllen Police Depart-ment. These five law enforcement officers en-gaged and prevented the Deutsch and Deutsch Jewelry store robbery on Saturday, July 28, 2018, at La Plaza Mall in McAllen, Texas. They apprehended seven male sus-pects who were attempting to rob this jewelry store midday during an otherwise calm week-end in South Texas. After entering the store with what appeared to be firearms, the suspects intimidated and threatened store staff while smashing glass displays. One off-duty officer working at a nearby store was alerted to the commotion and immediately went to appraise the situa-tion. He then approached the active scene with the assistance of an off-duty Pharr Police narcotics officer, an off-duty McAllen Police lieutenant and off-duty McAllen Police officers. Together they arrested the suspects and se-cured the scene. Thanks to the brave actions of these offi-cers, all seven suspects were taken into cus-tody, and no one was harmed and no shots were fired. Though off-duty, these officers re-mained committed to the safety and well-being of our community. I would be remiss to not thank McAllen Police Chief Victor Rodriguez for his leadership at the helm of the police de-partment for now more than 17 years. His vi-sion, tenacity, and approach to guiding the more than 400 people under his command at McAllen Police is admirable and second to none. Mr. Speaker, it is my distinct privilege to represent and recognize these courageous of-ficers from South Texas. These heroes de-serve our utmost respect and gratitude for a job extremely well done. f 
TRIBUTE TO FREDERICA ANTONIO 
HON. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM 
OF NEW MEXICO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, August 10, 2018 Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratu-late Frederica Antonio of Acoma Pueblo in New Mexico for her role in the Pueblo Pottery Mug project and her success as a Native art-ist. The Pueblo Pottery Mug project started as a collaboration between five Pueblo artists and the first Pueblo-owned Starbucks in New Mex-ico. The mugs were first sold in 2016 at the Starbucks store in Albuquerque.

After quickly selling out of the unique mugs—selling over 6,000 mugs—the Shumakolowa gift shop col-laborated with the artists to sell mugs at their location in the Indian Pueblo Cultural Center. Growing up in the Pueblo of Acoma, Fred-erica’s intricately designed work is a continu-ation of her long family tradition of hand- coiling and painting pottery. Much of the sym-bolism found on her pottery is connected to Mother Earth and prayers for rain. Frederica’s work heavily relies on the re-sources of the land. She hand-paints her ves-sels with fine-tipped brushes she fashions from the stems of yucca plants. She uses these traditional methods, taught to her by her mother-in-law, Mildred Antonio, to create her contemporary pieces. Mr. Speaker, I applaud Frederica Antonio for being a part of the Pueblo Pottery Mug project. This project has given the community, as well as visitors to New Mexico, an oppor-tunity to appreciate usable pieces of art that are inspired by Native culture and traditions. I look forward to seeing this project continue to flourish and support talented Native artists from Pueblos throughout New Mexico.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recog-nize a great Arkansan and one of the pillars of collegiate athletics in Arkansas—Coach Greg Harnden. Coach Harnden is retiring after 21 years as the Athletic Director of Harding University in Searcy, Arkansas. He helped facilitate Harding’s move from the NAIA to the NCAA as well as Harding’s move from the Gulf South Conference to its current home in the Great American Conference.

NOMINATION OF JUDGE BRETT KAVANAUGH TO THE SUPREME COURT 
HON. BARBARA LEE 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, August 10, 2018 Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with my colleagues in the Congressional Black Caucus to voice my opposition to President Trump’s nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court. The stakes could not be higher: Judge Kavanaugh is not the Justice that our nation needs, nor deserves. Voting rights, women’s reproductive rights, and af-firmative action are all under threat. Judge Kavanaugh’s confirmation could rede-fine the Supreme Court, and threatens to un-dermine some of our nation’s most important rights for decades to come. Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination poses a threat to voting rights. When the state of South Carolina tried to enforce a draconian voter ID law, the Obama Administration blocked the law. When the case was referred to the US District Court, Judge Kavanaugh, writing for the majority, upheld the voter I.D. law saying, ‘‘the South Carolina Law has nei-ther a discriminatory effect nor a discrimina-tory purpose. Moreover, South Carolina did not act with a discriminatory purpose.’’ The three-judge panel, led by Kavanaugh, upheld the law. The bill was signed by former Gov-ernor, and now UN Ambassador Nikki Haley. Kavanaugh’s nomination also poses a threat to reproductive rights. The landmark 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision not only gave women ac-cess to basic health care rights, but it also strengthened a woman’s right to choose. We’ve seen this playbook before, Mr. Speak-er; Republicans will stop at nothing to end Roe as we know it. They will chip away it. They will undermine it. They will erode it. And we know that women of color and women from low-income communities will be the most adversely impacted by restrictions on access to reproductive healthcare. From Kavanagh’s tacit approval of Justice Rehnquist’s dissent in Roe vs. Wade, to his own dissent in the 2017 ‘‘Jane Doe’’ vs. HHS case saying, ‘‘(we can’t allow) a new right for unlawful immigrant minors in U.S. Government detention to obtain immediate abortion on de-mand,’’ it is clear Judge Kavanaugh will be re-ceptive to cases prohibiting women’s right to choose. Finally, while Judge Kavanaugh has never written a judicial opinion on affirmative action, he has written an amicus brief for the Center for Equal Opportunity, an organization op-posed to the consideration of race in college admissions decisions. If affirmative action were to be limited or ended, historically disenfranchised students would have fewer opportunities to access mainstream institutions of higher learning. As a co-chair of the Congressional Pro- choice Caucus, and as a member of the Con-gressional Black Caucus, I will keep fighting to protect women’s reproductive rights, voting rights, and affirmative action. We must urge the Senate to oppose Trump’s dangerous nominee who represents a direct threat to our values as a nation. We can and must stop the nomination of Judge Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court. f 
RECOGNIZING THE 60TH ANNIVER-SARY OF HANOVER PARK, ILLI-NOIS 
HON. PETER J. ROSKAM 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, August 10, 2018 Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the in-corporation of Hanover Park, Illinois. Through its continued dedication to building a friendly and welcoming community for residents and visitors alike, Hanover Park is a model for other cities and towns to follow. In the years since its first permanent settlers in 1874 and its incorporation in 1958, Hanover Park has become a center of culture and com-merce. As home to 80 nationalities and 30 spoken languages, it is a diverse village. This diversity also transfers into their business en-vironment. Hanover Park has thriving business parks, a growing retail community, and easy access to global markets. While the Village’s police and fire departments are consistently recognized as two of the finest in the state, the local government is highly engaged and enthusiastic. All of these sectors make Han-over Park a vibrant and thriving community, as well as a great place to work, live, and raise a family. On the occasion of this 60th Anniversary, we join together to celebrate Hanover Park’s legacy of growth and prosperity and look ahead to the opportunities facing this Village and our great Nation. Today marks 60 years of working together to build a brighter future and reminds us that our work continues. Mr. Speaker and Distinguished Colleagues, please join me in recognizing the 60th anni-versary of the incorporation of Hanover Park, Illinois, and wishing its residents great success in the years ahead.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Bluffton Mayor Ted Ellis who recently announced his retirement after more than two decades of distinguished service. A native of Bluffton, Mayor Ellis has been a fix-ture in his community for many years. He served nine years on the Wells County Coun-cil before being elected Mayor in 1995. Mayor Ellis is one of the longest serving mayors in Indiana history and is known for his commitment to his community and the Hoosier state. In fact, the Governor of Indiana recog-nized Mayor Ellis’ contributions by naming him a ‘‘Sagamore of the Wabash,’’ Indiana’s high-est civilian honor. Mayor Ellis also was hon-ored by the Indiana Association of Cities and Towns with the Russell Lloyd Award for his ‘‘outstanding contributions to local govern-ment.’’ I want to congratulate Mayor Ellis, his wife Marge, and his family on an exceptional ca-reer and I wish him an enjoyable retirement.

TRIBUTE TO ROBIN TELLER

Robin is from the Pueblo of Isleta, where pottery has historically been made for func-tional or ceremonial uses. Since 1988, she has become known for her iconic storytellers, nativity scenes, human and animal figures, and polychrome vessels that honor the tradi-tions of her Pueblo. She uses the traditional method of digging clay, tuffa, and pigments from different areas of the Isleta Pueblo, some of which were used by generations past to col-lect clay. Robin’s work comes from the traditional de-signs of the Isleta Pueblo: red and black fluid geometric designs on a white background de-picting nature’s elements. Her work is also largely influenced by the generations of strong women in her family line. Mr. Speaker, I applaud Robin Teller for being a part of the Pueblo Pottery Mug project.

A HERO AMONG US—A TRIBUTE TO FIRST SERGEANT DAVID H. M
CNERNEY 
HON. TED POE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, August 10, 2018 Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, on Vet-eran’s Day, like every year, I started the morn-ing early and headed out to the first of many ceremonies across our district to honor the men and women who have proudly worn the military uniform of the United States. I just love it. I love seeing our veterans, especially the older heroes who seem to exude a kind of pride in their country and their service that only those of that great generation posses. But I found myself looking for a certain face, a certain hero of mine that I look forward to seeing at these events every year. While I kept reminding myself I wouldn’t find him this year, I saw everything he represented in the eyes of every veteran I met. Longtime Crosby resident, David H. McNer-ney, was a hero among us. First Sergeant McNerney received the Medal of Honor for his heroic actions in the Vietnam War. While this is enough to impress most anyone, it’s only part of the story. McNerney served not one tour of duty, not even two or three tours of duty—he served four combat tours of duty. Like some of my other favorite war heroes, McNerney wasn’t born in Texas, but got here as fast as he could. Born in Lowell, Massa-chusetts in 1931, he moved to Houston with his family in high school. After graduating from St. Thomas High School, McNerney enlisted in the Navy. After serving two tours in the Ko-rean War, he was discharged in 1952. McNerney gave college a try, enrolling at the University of Houston, but quickly realized his education would come from the battlefield rather than the classroom. In 1953, McNerney enlisted in the United States Army. Shortly after arriving at Fort Bliss, he was stationed in Korea and Okinawa. In 1962 he was sent to Vietnam as one of the first 500 military advi-sors deployed. In 1966, during his third combat tour of duty, he was stationed in the Central Highlands near the Cambodian border as a first sergeant with Company A, 1st Battalion, 8th Infantry Regiment, 4th Infantry Division. On the after-noon of March 21, 1967, he and his company were dropped in Polei Doc to recover a miss-ing reconnaissance team. The next morning, they came under heavy attack by the North Vi-etnamese and were easily outnumber three-to- one. McNerney quickly took the front line and was wounded by a grenade. The company commander was killed and without hesitation, and despite being wound-ed, McNerney took command of the unit. Under intense fire, McNerney took out an enemy machine gun position, but the unit took heavy casualties. In the midst of the chaos, he climbed a tree in plain sight of the North Viet-namese to mark his unit’s location before call-ing in an airstrike within 65 feet of their own position. He continued to move throughout the battle-field, pulling the wounded to safety and secur-ing demolition material to clear the area for the medical evacuation helicopters. Despite his own injuries, McNerney refused evacuation and stayed with his men until the new com-pany commander arrived the next day. His ac-tions not only stopped the enemy from ad-vancing and saved the lives of his men, his valor on the battlefield earned him the Medal of Honor. Now, this is where I usually say: ‘‘And that’s just the way it is.’’ But, the story is not over. David McNerney volunteered for a fourth tour in Vietnam before retiring as a first sergeant in December 1969. Let me say that again: David McNerney volunteered for a fourth tour in Viet-nam. The men that served with him have praised his leadership and bravery. They don’t mince words when it comes to what he has meant to them: There’s a bunch of guys walking around today who wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for him. Dennis Thompson Sr., who served in Viet-nam with McNerney, said: ‘‘If, in fact, he were not there, everyone would have gotten mas-sacred that day. People have to know that the man was a genuine hero.’’ First Sergeant David McNerney died Octo-ber 12, 2010 at the age of 79. His obituary said that he humbly summarized his pres-tigious military career by saying, ‘‘I was a pro-fessional soldier.’’ This Veteran’s Day was not the same for me. His absence was noticed, but his service is never forgotten. My friend, First Sergeant David McNerney, was a hero among us. And that’s just the way it is.

HONORING CAYETANO CABRIELES 
HON. VICENTE GONZALEZ 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, August 10, 2018 Mr. GONZALEZ of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Mr. Cayetano Cabrieles who celebrated his 100th birthday and received the Champion of Life Award on August 7, 2018. Cayetano Cabrieles was born in Linares, Nuevo Leon, Mexico in 1918. He worked on a ranch for much of his childhood, enduring ad-versity and overcoming many challenges. At the age of 23, Mr. Cabrieles married Juana Maria Mendoza, and together the couple raised four children. Mr. Cabrieles now lives in San Juan, Texas where he continues to work tirelessly to provide for his family. Though Mr. Cabrieles suffered many injuries while working, he nevertheless persevered. After a lifetime of strenuous work, Mr. Cabrieles retired at the age of 80 and now re-sides at the Palmas Health Care Center. Mr. Speaker, I’m honored to share Mr. Cayetano Cabrieles’s life story and recognize this true pioneer on his 100th birthday. Con-gratulations again to Mr. Cabrieles on this major milestone. TRIBUTE TO ELIZABETH MEDINA HON. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM 
OF NEW MEXICO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, August 10, 2018 Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratu-late Elizabeth Medina of Jemez Pueblo in New Mexico for her role in the Pueblo Pottery Mug project and her success as a Native artist. The Pueblo Pottery Mug project started as a collaboration between five Pueblo artists and the first Pueblo-owned Starbucks in New Mex-ico. The mugs were first sold in 2016 at the Starbucks store in Albuquerque. Each mug was hand-crafted by a different Pueblo artist to celebrate the opening of the new store and to symbolize the collaboration between New Mexico Pueblos and Starbucks. After quickly selling out of the unique mugs—selling over 6,000 mugs—the Shumakolowa gift shop col-laborated with the artists to sell mugs at their location in the Indian Pueblo Cultural Center. Elizabeth is originally from Jemez Pueblo and married into Zia Pueblo where she now lives with her husband, fellow artist Marcellus. She learned how to make traditional Zia pot-tery from her mother-in-law, renowned potter Sofia Medina, using the teachings of the past and the resources of the land to create and shape her pottery. Her work is celebrated for its craftsmanship, exquisitely painted designs, and elegance of form. Elizabeth’s work typically combines tradi-tional Zia symbols such as rainbows, birds, and flowers. Using kaolinite clay that is often featured in Zia pottery, she tempers it with ba-saltic rock to achieve a traditional finish. Her work displays a true appreciation for the teachings of the past and influences many of today’s artists. Mr. Speaker, I applaud Elizabeth Medina for being a part of the Pueblo Pottery Mug project. This project has given the community, as well as visitors to New Mexico, an oppor-tunity to appreciate usable pieces of art that are inspired by Native culture and traditions. I look forward to seeing this project continue to flourish and support talented Native artists from Pueblos throughout New Mexico.
