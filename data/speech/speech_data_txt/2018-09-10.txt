RESIGNATION FROM THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-fore the House the following resigna-tion from the House of Representa-tives: 
CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES , H
OUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , Washington, DC, September 10, 2018. D
EAR SPEAKER RYAN: One of my guiding principles during my tenure in Congress has been to protect the taxpayers that I rep-resent. This is why in my first days in office, I rejected my congressional pension, turned down the healthcare subsidy for members of Congress, and fought against a congressional pay raise. I believe members of Congress should not be treated any differently than those they govern. I’ve done my best to live these principles: I refused my pay during government shutdowns and have slept in my office to cut costs and be a more effective legislator. During my time in Congress, we’ve been able to accomplish some great things. I’ve had the honor to lead on important issues such as eliminating the Sexual Harassment Slush Fund for members of Congress, in-creasing protections for sexual assault vic-tims in the military, and getting the PAWS Act to the floor for a vote later this month, which will provide much needed help for service members dealing with Post-Trau-matic Stress. I’ve also been proud to play a significant role in helping pass one of the largest tax cuts in our country’s history and moving the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jeru-salem. As the Republican nominee for Governor of Florida, it is clear to me that I will likely miss the vast majority of our remaining ses-sion days for this Congress. Under these cir-cumstances, it would be inappropriate for me to accept a salary. In order to honor my principles and protect the taxpayer, I offi-cially resign from the House of Representa-tives effective immediately. For purposes of pay, I ask that my resignation be retroactive to September 1 so that I do not receive any pay for the month of September. This is not a decision I make lightly. It has been an honor to serve the people of Flor-ida’s Sixth Congressional District, and I look forward to serving them and the rest of Flor-ida as our state’s next Governor. Respectfully, R
ONDESANTIS .

The term ‘‘program, project, or activity’’ shall include the most specific level of budget items identified in the Energy and Water Development Appro-priations Act, 2019 and the conference report accompanying the Act. Dam Removal.—No specific funding was provided in fiscal year 2018 and none was re-quested by any agencies funded in this Act in fiscal year 2019 for the purpose of removing a federally owned or operated dam without prior authorization by Congress. Con-sequently, no specific funds for unauthorized federal dam removal are included for any agency funded in this Act. Columbia River spill.—Many conferees have grave concerns about judicial interference in the operation of the hydroelectric dams on the Columbia and Snake Rivers. In 2016, a federal judge overturned the 2014 Federal Co-lumbia River Power System Biological Opin-ion, a plan that was painstakingly nego-tiated by scientists and engineering experts at federal agencies under the Bush and Obama Administrations, affected states, sov-ereign Northwest tribes, and local stake-holders. More troubling, the judge also or-dered additional forced spill through the sys-tem beginning in early April 2018 without re-quiring plaintiffs to show that harm or threat to species would result without that action. There was no specific scientific back-ing cited for this decision. Spilling at this in-creased level can threaten the reliability of the federal power and transmission systems and result in impacts to transportation and barging systems, flood control capabilities, and irrigation systems. Additionally, some scientific studies warn that increased gas levels stemming from the spill ordered by the decision could in fact harm the very fish species the Biological Opinion was developed to protect. Estimates of the cost to the transmission system and ratepayers are ap-proximately $40 million for 2018 alone. C
IVILWORKS REORGANIZATION PROPOSAL  On July 30, 2018, the Secretary of Defense approved a Secretary of the Army memo-randum identifying specific actions the Army will take in support of the Administra-tion’s proposed reorganization of the Civil Works program of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The proposal includes taking the Civil Works program out of the Corps with navigation going to the Department of Transportation for infrastructure grants and the remaining accounts to the Department of the Interior. The conferees are opposed to the proposed reorganization as it could ultimately have detrimental impacts for implementation of the Civil Works program and for the numer-ous non-federal entities that rely on the Corps’ technical expertise, including in re-sponse to natural disasters. The conferees are extremely concerned that an action of this magnitude, which

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH7970 September 10, 2018 
crosses multiple jurisdictional lines and has far-reaching consequences, was not properly brought to Congress as a proposal, allowing for oversight and hearings as to its effects. Notification and discussion with Members of Congress and Committee staffs was non-existent. Further, this type of proposal, as the Department of Defense and the Corps are well aware, will require enactment of legisla-tion, which has neither been proposed nor re-quested to date. Therefore, no funds provided in this Act or any previous Act to any agen-cy shall be used to implement this proposal. TITLE I—CORPS OF ENGINEERS—CIVIL DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY C
ORPS OF ENGINEERS —CIVIL The summary tables included in this title set forth the dispositions with respect to the individual appropriations, projects, and ac-tivities of the Corps of Engineers. Additional items of the Act are discussed below. Recent statutory changes regarding the In-land Waterways Trust Fund (IWTF) have re-sulted in an increase to the size of the cap-ital improvement program that can be sup-ported by the IWTF. The agreement reflects congressional interest in supporting this larger program. The Corps is directed to take the preparatory steps necessary to ensure that new construction projects can be initi-ated as soon as can be supported under the larger capital program (i.e., as ongoing projects approach completion). Concerns persist that the effort to update the Water Resources Principles and Guide-lines did not proceed consistent with the lan-guage or intent of section 2031 of the Water Resources Development Act of 2007. No funds provided to the Corps of Engineers shall be used to develop or implement rules or guid-ance to support implementation of the final Principles and Requirements for Federal In-vestments in Water Resources released in March 2013 or the final Interagency Guide-lines released in December 2014. The Corps shall continue to use the document dated March 10, 1983, and entitled ‘‘Economic and Environmental Principles and Guidelines for Water and Related Land Resources Imple-mentation Studies’’ during the fiscal year period covered by the Energy and Water De-velopment Appropriations Act for 2019. Asian Carp.—In lieu of House and Senate direction, the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers, shall make every effort to submit to Congress the Re-port of the Chief of Engineers for the Bran-don Road feasibility study according to the original published schedule of February 2019. The conferees understand that the money al-located to the study in the fiscal year 2018 work plan and the fiscal year 2019 budget re-quest is sufficient to complete the feasibility phase. The Corps is encouraged to move ex-peditiously to the preconstruction engineer-ing and design (PED) phase once feasibility is complete, including requesting sufficient funding in future budget submissions. The Corps is directed to provide quarterly up-dates to the Committees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress on the progress and status of efforts to prevent the further spread of Asian carp as well as the location and density of carp populations, including the use of emergency procedures. The Corps shall continue to collaborate with the U.S. Coast Guard, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the State of Illinois, and members of the Asian Carp Regional Coordi-nating Committee to identify and evaluate whether navigation protocols would be bene-ficial or effective in reducing the risk of ves-sels inadvertently carrying aquatic invasive species, including Asian carp, through the Brandon Road Lock and Dam in Joliet, Illi-nois. Any findings of such an evaluation shall be included in the quarterly briefings to the Committees. The Corps is further di-rected to implement navigation protocols shown to be effective at reducing the risk of entrainment without jeopardizing the safety of vessels and crews. The Corps and other federal and state agencies are conducting on-going research on potential solutions. The Corps shall brief the Committees on Appro-priations of both Houses of Congress on such navigation protocols and potential solutions within 30 days of enactment of this Act. Budget Structure Changes.—The agreement includes House and Senate language regard-ing budget structure changes. Apportionment Under a Continuing Resolu-tion.—The conferees are concerned about re-cent changes in the way funds are appor-tioned under a continuing resolution. Artifi-cially limiting the Corps’ flexibility to fund the highest priority projects during the time of a continuing resolution by creating de-marcations between funds from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund, the Inland Water-ways Trust Fund, and the general fund im-pedes efficient and effective implementation of the Civil Works program. The conferees believe the previous policy on apportionment under a continuing resolution, which pro-vides maximum flexibility, should be re-stored. Report on Flood and Storm Damage Reduc-tion Business Line.—Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Corps shall provide to the Committees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress a report that provides a definition for the terms ‘‘coastal project’’ and ‘‘inland project’’ within the flood and coastal storm damage reduction business line. For each of the last ten fiscal years, the report shall include the total amount of funding allocated to coastal projects and the total amount of funding al-located to inland projects within this busi-ness line. The report shall name each project and include an analysis comparing the level of funding in proportion to the amount of work needed in coastal areas. Report on Certain Cost-Shared Projects. —The Corps shall submit to the appropriate com-mittees of Congress a report that includes a list of all cost-shared Corps projects that as of the date of enactment of this Act are physically and fiscally complete and for which excess non-federal funds have not been returned to the non-federal project sponsor. With respect to each project on the list, the report shall describe the status of returning the excess funds to the non-federal project sponsor and providing the non-federal project sponsor a final accounting of the project. Everglades Restoration and Lake Okee-chobee.—The restoration of the Everglades, as described in the Comprehensive Ever-glades Restoration Plan (CERP) authorized by Public Law 106–541 is the most ambitious environmental restoration program in our nation’s history. The objectives of CERP are the restoration, preservation, and protection of the South Florida ecosystem, while pro-viding for other water related needs, includ-ing water supply and flood protection. The Corps shall continue to implement CERP, as authorized, to ensure the protec-tion of water quality, to reduce the loss of fresh water, and to improve the environment of the South Florida ecosystem, while achieving and maintaining the benefits to the natural system and human environment described in the Plan. The equal partnership between the federal government and the State of Florida remains essential to accom-plishing the objectives of the Plan. The con-ferees note that the Plan authorizes a 50/50 federal-state cost share for all aspects of congressionally authorized restoration projects, including, where applicable, water quality project features or components. The discharge of excess water from Lake Okeechobee to the Caloosahatchee Estuary and the Indian River Lagoon represents a significant loss of fresh water from the South Florida ecosystem. The diversion of those discharges to CERP projects or fea-tures, such as the Everglades Agricultural Area Storage Reservoir, designed to store and treat water prior to release into the Cen-tral Everglades, is an essential source of fresh water for meeting the objectives of the Plan. To minimize downstream impacts from reduced water quality and harmful algal blooms to local communities and wildlife habitat, the Corps is encouraged, when ap-propriate, to only conduct releases of water from Lake Okeechobee to the Caloosahatchee Estuary or the Indian River Lagoon in pulses, unless a release is nec-essary to protect the integrity of the Herbert Hoover Dike and minimize threats to lives and human health. A
DDITIONAL FUNDING  The agreement includes funding in addi-tion to the budget request to ensure contin-ued improvements to our national economy, public safety, and environmental health that result from water resources projects. This funding is for additional work that either was not included in the budget request or was inadequately budgeted. The bill contains a provision requiring the Corps to allocate funds in accordance with only the direction in this agreement. In lieu of all House and Senate report direction—under any head-ing—regarding additional funding, new starts, and the fiscal year 2019 work plan, the Corps shall follow the direction included in this conference report. The executive branch retains complete dis-cretion over project-specific allocation deci-sions within the additional funds provided, subject to only the direction here and under the heading ‘‘Additional Funding’’ or ‘‘Addi-tional Funding for Ongoing Work’’ within each of the Investigations, Construction, Mississippi River and Tributaries, and Oper-ation and Maintenance accounts. A study or project may not be excluded from evaluation for being ‘‘inconsistent with Administration policy.’’ Voluntary funding in excess of le-gally required cost shares for studies and projects is acceptable, but shall not be used as a criterion for allocating the additional funding provided or for the selection of new starts. The Administration is reminded that these funds are in addition to the budget request, and Administration budget metrics shall not be a reason to disqualify a study or project from being funded. It is expected that all of the additional funding provided will be allo-cated to specific programs, projects, or ac-tivities. The focus of the allocation process shall favor the obligation, rather than ex-penditure, of funds. The Corps shall evaluate all studies and projects only within accounts and categories consistent with previous congressional fund-ing. When allocating the additional funding provided in this Act, the Corps shall consider eligibility and implementation decisions under Public Law 115–123 so as to maximize the reduction of risk to public safety and in-frastructure and the reduction of future damages from floods and storms nationwide. A project or study shall be eligible for ad-ditional funding within the Investigations, Construction, and Mississippi River and Tributaries accounts if: (1) it has received funding, other than through a reprogram-ming, in at least one of the previous three fiscal years; (2) it was previously funded and could reach a significant milestone, com-plete a discrete element of work, or produce significant outputs in calendar year 2019; or (3) as appropriate, it is selected as one of the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H7971 September 10, 2018 
new starts allowed in accordance with this Act and the additional direction provided below. Projects with executed Advanced Project Partnership Agreements, or similar agreements, shall be eligible for additional funding provided in this bill. None of the ad-ditional funding in any account may be used for any item where funding was specifically denied or for projects in the Continuing Au-thorities Program. Funds shall be allocated consistent with statutory cost share require-ments. Work Plan.—Not later than 60 days after the enactment of this Act, the Corps shall provide to the Committees on Appropria-tions of both Houses of Congress a work plan including the following information: (1) a de-tailed description of the process and criteria used to evaluate studies and projects; (2) de-lineation of how these funds are to be allo-cated; (3) a summary of the work to be ac-complished with each allocation, including phase of work and the study or project’s re-maining cost to complete (excluding Oper-ation and Maintenance); and (4) a list of all studies and projects that were considered eli-gible for funding but did not receive funding, including an explanation of whether the study or project could have used funds in cal-endar year 2019 and the specific reasons each study or project was considered as being less competitive for an allocation of funds. New Starts.—The agreement includes six new starts in the Investigations account and five new starts in the Construction account to be distributed across the authorized mis-sion areas of the Corps. Of the new starts in Investigations, one shall be for a navigation study; one shall be for a flood and storm damage reduction study; one shall be for an environmental res-toration study; and three shall be for naviga-tion, flood and storm damage reduction, en-vironmental restoration, water supply, or multi-purpose studies. In the appropriate categories, the Corps shall consider selection of a small, remote, or subsistence navigation study and a multi-purpose watershed study to address coastal resiliency. Of the new con-struction starts, one shall be for a naviga-tion project; one shall be for a flood and storm damage reduction project; one shall be for an environmental restoration project; and two shall be for navigation, flood and storm damage reduction, environmental res-toration, or multi-purpose projects. In the appropriate categories, the Corps shall con-sider selection of a coastal storm damage re-duction project. No funding shall be used to initiate new programs, projects, or activities in the Mississippi River and Tributaries or Operation and Maintenance accounts. The Corps is directed to propose a single group of new starts as a part of the work plan. None of the funds may be used for any item for which the agreement has specifi-cally denied funding. The Corps may not change or substitute the new starts selected once the work plan has been provided to the Committees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress. Each new start shall be funded from the appropriate additional fund-ing line item. Any project for which the new start requirements are not met by the end of fiscal year 2019 shall be treated as if the project had not been selected as a new start; such a project shall be required to compete again for new start funding in future years. As all new starts are to be chosen by the Corps, all shall be considered of equal impor-tance, and the expectation is that future budget submissions will include appropriate funding for all new starts selected. There continues to be confusion regarding the executive branch’s policies and guide-lines regarding which studies and projects require new start designations. Therefore, the Corps is directed to notify the Commit-tees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress at least 7 days prior to execution of an agreement for construction of any project except environmental infrastructure projects and projects under the Continuing Authori-ties Program. Additionally, the agreement reiterates and clarifies previous congres-sional direction as follows. Neither study nor construction activities related to individual projects authorized under section 1037 of the Water Resources Reform and Development Act (WRRDA) of 2014 shall require a new start or new investment decision; these ac-tivities shall be considered ongoing work. No new start or new investment decision shall be required when moving from feasibility to PED. A new start designation shall be re-quired to initiate construction of individ-ually-authorized projects funded within pro-grammatic line items. No new start or new investment decision shall be required to ini-tiate work on a separable element of a project when construction of one or more separable elements of that project was initi-ated previously; it shall be considered ongo-ing work. A new construction start shall not be required for work undertaken to correct a design deficiency on an existing federal project; it shall be considered ongoing work. The Corps is reminded that resumptions are just that—resumption of previously-initiated studies or projects and, as such, do not re-quire new start designations. In addition to the priority factors used to allocate all additional funding provided in the Investigations account, the Corps should give careful consideration to the out-year budget impacts of the studies selected and to whether there appears to be an identifiable local sponsor that will be ready and able to provide, in a timely manner, the necessary cost share for the feasibility and PED phases. The Corps is reminded that the flood and storm damage reduction mission area can include instances where non-federal sponsors are seeking assistance with flood control and unauthorized discharges from permitted wastewater treatment facilities and that the navigation mission area in-cludes work in remote and subsistence har-bor areas. Within the flood and storm dam-age reduction mission, the Corps is urged to strive for an appropriate balance between in-land and coastal projects. In addition to the priority factors used to allocate all additional funding provided in the Construction account, the Corps also shall consider the out-year budget impacts of the selected new starts; and the cost sharing sponsor’s ability and willingness to promptly provide the cash contribution (if any), as well as required lands, easements, rights-of- way, relocations, and disposal areas. When considering new construction starts, only those that can execute a project cost sharing agreement not later than September 30, 2019, shall be chosen. To ensure that the new construction starts are affordable and will not unduly delay completion of any ongoing projects, the Sec-retary is required to submit to the Commit-tees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress a realistic out-year budget scenario prior to issuing a work allowance for a new start. It is understood that specific budget decisions are made on an annual basis and that this scenario is neither a request for nor a guarantee of future funding for any project. Nonetheless, this scenario shall in-clude an estimate of annual funding for each new start utilizing a realistic funding sce-nario through completion of the project, as well as the specific impacts of that esti-mated funding on the ability of the Corps to make continued progress on each previously funded construction project (including im-pacts to the optimum timeline and funding requirements of the ongoing projects) and on the ability to consider initiating new projects in the future. The scenario shall as-sume a Construction account funding level at the average of the past three budget re-quests. E
XECUTION OF CORPS FUNDING  The conferees are concerned with delays in executing funds that have been appropriated in regular and supplemental appropriations bills. While the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has a responsibility to oversee execution of the funds, the conferees are con-cerned that OMB is adding additional bur-dens to the Corps’ processes that may result in unnecessary delays and potentially over-riding technical and expert judgments by the Corps. The conferees expect funds appro-priated in this Act to be quickly and effi-ciently executed, consistent with the terms and conditions in this conference report. 
INVESTIGATIONS  The agreement includes $125,000,000 for In-vestigations. The agreement includes legisla-tive language regarding parameters for new study starts. The allocation for projects and activities within the Investigations account is shown in the following table:

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H7975 September 10, 2018 
Passaic River Basin Mainstem, New Jersey. — Flooding has long been a problem in the Pas-saic River Basin. The Corps is encouraged to continue to work in coordination with the non-federal sponsor on plans to reduce flood-ing in the basin, including the reevaluation of the Passaic River Basin Mainstem project. The Corps is directed to brief the Commit-tees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress not later than 30 days after the en-actment of this Act on the current status of this project. Peckman River, New Jersey.—There have been repeated delays with the Peckman River Feasibility Study. The Corps is di-rected to provide to the Committees on Ap-propriations of both Houses of Congress quarterly briefings on the current schedule to bring this study to completion, with the first briefing to occur not later than 30 days after the enactment of this Act. Rahway River Basin (Upper Basin), New Jer-sey.—There have been extended delays with the Rahway River Basin Flood Risk Manage-ment Feasibility Study where flooding is of acute concern to the affected communities. The Corps is encouraged to continue to work with the non-federal sponsor on plans to re-duce flooding caused by the Rahway River in affected areas. The Corps is directed to pro-vide to the Committees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress quarterly briefings on the current schedule to bring this study to completion, with the first briefing to occur not later than 30 days after the enact-ment of this Act. The Corps is encouraged to include funding for this study in future budg-et submissions. Additional Funding.—The Corps is expected to allocate the additional funding provided in this account primarily to specific feasi-bility and PED phases, rather than to Re-maining Items line items as has been the case in previous work plans. Of the addi-tional funding provided in this account for navigation and coastal and deep draft navi-gation, the Corps shall allocate not less than $2,500,000 for navigation PED. Of the addi-tional funding provided in this account for flood and storm damage reduction and shore protection, the Corps shall allocate not less than $400,000 for shore protection PED. When allocating the additional funding provided in this account, the Corps shall consider giving priority to completing or accelerating ongo-ing studies or to initiating new studies that will enhance the nation’s economic develop-ment, job growth, and international com-petitiveness; are for projects located in areas that have suffered recent natural disasters; are for projects that protect life and prop-erty; are for projects to restore floodplain and aquatic habitat through cost-effective and tested means; or are for projects to ad-dress legal requirements. The Corps shall use these funds for additional work in both the feasibility and PED phases. The agreement includes sufficient additional funding to un-dertake a significant amount of feasibility and PED work. The Administration is re-minded that a project study is not complete until the PED phase is complete. The Corps is reminded that environmental restoration can include projects that address degraded conditions due to prior flood protection work. The Corps is reminded that the updat-ing of economic analyses and economic im-pact studies are eligible to receive additional funding. Water Resources Priorities Study.—No fund- ing shall be used for this study. Disposition of Completed Projects. —The agreement includes Senate direction. Addi-tionally, the agreement supports the budget request for the disposition study pursuant to facilities that closed as a result of Public Law 113–121. The Corps is directed to provide to the Committees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress copies of this study upon completion. For Corps facilities that are deemed as excess in such study, the Com-mittee supports the disposal of those facili-ties through the appropriate General Serv-ices Administration process. Research and Development.—Within avail-able funds, the Corps shall advance work on activities included in the House and Senate reports. Puget Sound.—The conferees encourage the Corps to proceed with the tiered implemen-tation strategy using all existing authorities as outlined in the Puget Sound Nearshore Ecosystem Restoration Project Feasibility Study, Completion Strategy Guidance dated June 2015. The Corps is further directed to recognize the Puget Sound Nearshore Study as the feasibility component for the purposes of Section 544 of the Water Resources Devel-opment Act of 2000. The Corps is commended for initiating PED on the Duckabush River Estuary component of this project. The Corps is urged to include funding in future budget submissions to continue PED, as completing this project is critical to restor-ing the natural processes in the nearshore zone that sustain biological and economic resources. Upper Mississippi River-Illinois Waterway System.—The fiscal year 2018 work plan allo-cated $1,000,000 to initiate and complete an economic update of the Navigation Eco-system Sustainability Program. Not later than 60 days after the enactment of this Act, the Corps shall provide to the Committees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress a report on the scope of the economic update and any expected future costs for completing the study phase. The Corps is encouraged to complete the economic update expeditiously, so that PED can resume in a timely fashion. 
CONSTRUCTION  The agreement includes $2,183,000,000 for Construction. The agreement includes legis-lative language regarding Chickamauga Lock, Tennessee River, Tennessee. The agreement includes legislative language re-garding parameters for new construction starts. The allocation for projects and activities within the Construction account is shown in the following table:

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H7979 September 10, 2018 
Updated Capability.—The agreement ad-justs some project-specific allocations down-ward from the budget request based on up-dated information regarding the amount of work that could be accomplished in fiscal year 2019. Additional Funding.—The agreement in-cludes additional funds for projects and ac-tivities to enhance the nation’s economic growth and international competitiveness. Of the additional funds provided in this ac-count, the Corps shall allocate not less than $4,445,000 to projects with riverfront develop-ment components. Of the additional funding provided in this account for flood and storm damage reduction and flood control, the Corps shall allocate not less than $9,800,000 to additional nonstructural flood control projects. Of the additional funds provided in this account for flood and storm damage re-duction, navigation, and other authorized project purposes, the Corps shall allocate not less than $25,000,000 to authorized reimburse-ments for projects with executed project co-operation agreements and that have com-pleted construction or where non-federal sponsors intend to use the funds for addi-tional water resources development activi-ties. Of the additional funding provided in this account for flood and storm damage re-duction and flood control, the Corps shall al-locate not less than $20,000,000 to continue construction of projects that principally ad-dress drainage in urban areas, of which not less than $4,500,000 shall be for projects that principally include improvements to rainfall drainage systems that address flood dam-ages. Of the additional funding provided in this account, the Corps shall allocate not less than $1,800,000 to complete a plan for a purpose outside the Corps’ traditional mis-sion. The Corps is reminded that dam safety projects authorized under section 5003 of the Water Resources Development Act of 2007 are eligible to compete for the additional fund-ing provided in this account. Public Law 115–123 included funding within the Flood Control and Coastal Emergencies account to restore authorized shore protec-tion projects to full project profile. That funding is expected to address most of the current year capability. Therefore, to ensure funding is not directed to where it cannot be used, the agreement includes $55,000,000 for construction of shore protection projects. The Corps is reminded that if additional work can be done, these projects are also eli-gible to compete for additional funding for flood and storm damage reduction. When allocating the additional funding provided in this account, the Corps is en-couraged to evaluate authorized reimburse-ments in the same manner as if the projects were being evaluated for new or ongoing con-struction. When allocating the additional funding provided in this account, the Corps shall consider giving priority to the fol-lowing: 1. benefits of the funded work to the na-tional economy; 2. extent to which the work will enhance national, regional, or local economic devel-opment; 3. number of jobs created directly and sup-ported in the supply chain by the funded ac-tivity; 4. significance to national security, includ-ing the strategic significance of commod-ities; 5. ability to obligate the funds allocated within the fiscal year, including consider-ation of the ability of the non-federal spon-sor to provide any required cost share; 6. ability to complete the project, sepa-rable element, or project phase with the funds allocated; 7. legal requirements, including respon-sibilities to Tribes; 8. for flood and storm damage reduction projects (including authorized nonstructural measures and periodic beach renourish-ments), a. population, economic activity, or public infrastructure at risk, as appropriate; and b. the severity of risk of flooding or the frequency with which an area has experi-enced flooding; 9. for shore protection projects, projects in areas that have suffered severe beach erosion requiring additional sand placement outside of the normal beach renourishment cycle or in which the normal beach renourishment cycle has been delayed; 10. for navigation projects, the number of jobs or level of economic activity to be sup-ported by completion of the project, sepa-rable element, or project phase; 11. for projects cost shared with the IWTF, the economic impact on the local, regional, and national economy if the project is not funded, as well as discrete elements of work that can be completed within the funding provided in this line item; 12. for other authorized project purposes and environmental restoration or compli-ance projects, to include the beneficial use of dredged material; and 13. for environmental infrastructure, projects with the greater economic impact, projects in rural communities, projects in communities with significant shoreline and instances of runoff, projects in or that ben-efit counties or parishes with high poverty rates, projects in financially distressed mu-nicipalities, projects that improve stormwater capture capabilities, and projects that will provide substantial bene-fits to water quality improvements. The following is the only direction with re-gard to the availability of additional funds for IWTF projects. The agreement provides funds making use of all estimated annual revenues and some additional prior-year rev-enues in the IWTF. The Corps shall allocate all funds provided in the IWTF Revenues line item along with the statutory cost share from funds provided in the Navigation line item prior to allocating the remainder of funds in the Navigation line item. Aquatic Plant Control Program. —Of the funding provided for the Aquatic Plant Con-trol Program, $1,000,000 shall be for activities for the control of the flowering rush. Of the funding provided for the Aquatic Plant Con-trol Program, $5,000,000 shall be for nation-wide research and development to address invasive aquatic plants; within this funding, the Corps is encouraged to support cost shared aquatic plant management programs. Of the funding provided for the Aquatic Plant Control Program, $5,000,000 shall be for watercraft inspection stations, as authorized by section 1039 of the WRRDA of 2014, and $1,000,000 shall be for related monitoring. Continuing Authorities Program (CAP). —The agreement continues to support all sections of the Continuing Authorities Program. Funding is provided for eight CAP sections at a total of $66,000,000, an increase of $62,500,000 above the budget request, which proposed funding for only four sections. This program provides a useful tool for the Corps to undertake small localized projects with-out the lengthy study and authorization process typical of larger Corps projects. Within the Continuing Authorities Program and to the extent already authorized by law, the Corps is encouraged to consider projects that enhance coastal and ocean ecosystem resiliency and projects that restore degraded wetland habitat and stream habitat im-pacted by construction of Corps levees. The management of the Continuing Authorities Program shall continue consistent with di-rection provided in previous fiscal years. Dam Safety and Seepage/Stability Correction Program.—The conferees reject the budget re-quest proposal regarding Herbert Hoover Dike, which would make funds provided in this program available only if the State of Florida commits certain funds. Consistent with long-standing congressional direction, the Corps may not require funding in excess of legally required cost shares for studies and projects as a criterion for funding deci-sions. The Corps shall apply these funds to the highest priority projects. Beneficial Use of Dredged Material Pilot Pro-gram.—The agreement includes House direc-tion on this program. Public-Private Partnerships.—The agree-ment only includes direction in the Expenses account. Oyster Restoration.—The conferees support Gulf Coast oyster restoration efforts and the Chesapeake Bay Oyster Restoration pro-gram. The Corps is encouraged to include funding in future budget submissions for these efforts. Metro East Levees.—The conferees urge the Corps to include funding for the Metro East levee system in future budget submissions. Rehabilitation of Corps Constructed Dams. — Implementation guidance for section 1177 of the WIIN Act is awaiting approval. The Corps is directed to submit this implementa-tion guidance to the Committees on Appro-priations of both Houses of Congress as expe-ditiously as possible. Natural Infrastructure Options.—The agree-ment includes Senate direction with the clarification that it applies during the project formulation phase. Camp Ellis Beach, Saco, Maine.—The con- ferees are concerned by the continued delay in implementing a solution at Camp Ellis Beach in Saco, Maine. To address continued erosion, which has destroyed 37 homes to date, the Corps’ initial study recommended a shore damage mitigation project consisting of a 750-foot-long spur jetty, and placement of about 360,000 cubic yards of beach fill along the beach. The project’s design and costs are under review and being updated in preparation for a new report to Congress de-tailing a path ahead on the project. Accord-ingly, the conferees direct the Secretary to expeditiously submit this report to the Com-mittees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress. This report shall include any addi-tional legislative authorities necessary for the project to be approved and constructed. Soo Locks, Sault Ste. Marie, Chippewa Coun-ty, Michigan.—The conferees are aware that the Corps has released a new Soo Lock Eco-nomic Validation Study and Post Authoriza-tion Change Report with a strong benefit to cost ratio and a recommendation to move forward on construction of a new lock. The Corps is urged to include funding for the new lock in future budget submissions. 
MISSISSIPPI RIVER AND TRIBUTARIES  The agreement includes $368,000,000 for Mississippi River and Tributaries. The allocation for projects and activities within the Mississippi River and Tributaries account is shown in the following table:

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH8004 September 10, 2018 
Updated Capability.—The agreement ad-justs some project-specific allocations down-ward from the budget request based on up-dated information regarding the amount of work that could be accomplished in fiscal year 2019. Additional Funding for Ongoing Work. — When allocating the additional funding pro-vided in this account, the Corps shall con-sider giving priority to the following: 1. ability to complete ongoing work main-taining authorized depths and widths of har-bors and shipping channels, including where contaminated sediments are present; 2. ability to address critical maintenance backlog; 3. presence of the U.S. Coast Guard; 4. extent to which the work will enhance national, regional, or local economic devel-opment, including domestic manufacturing capacity; 5. extent to which the work will promote job growth or international competitiveness; 6. number of jobs created directly by the funded activity; 7. ability to obligate the funds allocated within the fiscal year; 8. ability to complete the project, sepa-rable element, project phase, or useful incre-ment of work within the funds allocated; 9. addressing hazardous barriers to naviga-tion due to shallow channels; 10. risk of imminent failure or closure of the facility; and 11. for harbor maintenance activities, a. total tonnage handled; b. total exports; c. total imports; d. dollar value of cargo handled; e. energy infrastructure and national secu-rity needs served; f. designation as strategic seaports; g. lack of alternative means of freight movement; and h. savings over alternative means of freight movement. Additional funding provided for donor and energy transfer ports shall be allocated in accordance with 33 U.S.C. 2238c. The Corps is encouraged to include funding for this pro-gram in future budget submissions. The Corps is directed to execute fully subsection (c) of 33 U.S.C. 2238c not later than 90 days after enactment of this Act. The Corps is reminded that debris removal activities pursuant to 33 U.S.C. 603a, includ-ing in urban waterways, and activities nec-essary to carry out soil moisture and snowpack monitoring are eligible to compete for additional funding in this account. Concerns persist that the Administration’s criteria for navigation maintenance do not allow small, remote, or subsistence harbors and waterways to properly compete for scarce navigation maintenance funds. The Corps is urged to revise the criteria used for determining which navigation projects are funded in order to develop a reasonable and equitable allocation under this account. The criteria should include the economic impact that these projects provide to local and re-gional economies. Aquatic Nuisance Research Program. —Within available funds, the Corps is encouraged to support research that will identify and de-velop improved strategies for early detec-tion, prevention, and management tech-niques and procedures to reduce the occur-rence and impacts of harmful algal blooms in our nation’s water resources. Coastal Inlet Research Program.—The con- ferees understand that communities, infra-structure, commerce, and resources that are tied to the coastal nearshore region are all vulnerable to damage from extreme coastal events and long-term coastal change. Fund-ing in addition to the budget request is in-cluded for the Corps to establish and lead a multi-university effort to identify engineer-ing frameworks to address coastal resilience needs, to develop adaptive pathways that lead to coastal resilience, measure the coast-al forces that lead to infrastructure damage and erosion during extreme storm events, and to improve coupling of terrestrial and coastal models. Funding in addition to the budget request is also included for the Corps to continue work with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Water Center on protecting the nation’s water resources. Facility Protection.—The agreement pro-vides funding for completion and deployment of tools to address hydrologic extremes. Monitoring of Completed Navigation Projects.—Of the funding provided, $4,000,000 shall be to support the structural health monitoring program to facilitate research to maximize operations, enhance efficiency, and protect asset life through catastrophic failure mitigation; $2,000,000 shall be for re-search related to the impacts of reduced navigational lock operations as described in the Senate report; and $600,000 shall be avail-able for additional work on advanced non-de-structive testing methods of inspection and the validation of technologies such as pro-tective coatings. The Corps is directed to brief the Committees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress not later than 90 days after the enactment of this Act on its planned activities in each area, future fund-ing requirements of ongoing efforts, and the scope and effectiveness of programs at var-ious annual funding levels. The Corps is en-couraged to also consider the need for addi-tional work on the evaluation of grouted trunnion rods. National Dam Safety Program.—The Corps, in cooperation with the Federal Energy Reg-ulatory Commission and the Bureau of Rec-lamation, shall contract with an independent peer review organization to conduct a com-prehensive Independent External Peer Re-view (IEPR) of risk-informed dam safety practices in these three federal agencies with the intent to inform improvements broadly in national dam safety practices. The Corps is directed to contract with an independent peer review organization in accordance with its current review policy and the National Academy of Science IEPR process. The IEPR shall also consider how dam safety practices are affected by human factors, as well as how risk informed analysis in other industries may be applicable to dam safety practices. National (Multiple Project) Natural Resources Management Activities.—Any costs to cover administrative fees or any other efforts nec-essary to resolve encroachments that were the result of past land surveying errors made by the Corps are eligible for funding provided above the budget request. Water Operations Technical Support. —Fund- ing in addition to the budget request is in-cluded for research into atmospheric rivers first funded in fiscal year 2015, of which $5,000,000 is included to continue ongoing ef-forts, and an additional $2,500,000 is provided to expand this research effort to other loca-tions as appropriate. Prior to obligating these funds for this expanded effort, how-ever, the Corps shall brief the Committees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress on the details of an expanded effort, includ-ing activities to be undertaken, the total and annual cost estimate, expected transfer-ability of tools developed of other results of the research, as well as the likelihood of ad-ditional investment being necessary. The Corps shall scope the expanded effort to fit within recent annual funding levels. Great Lakes Navigation System.—The agree-ment includes funding for individual projects within this System that exceeds the funding level envisioned in section 210(d)(1)(B)(ii) of the Water Resources Development Act of 1986. Kennebec River Long-Term Maintenance Dredging.—The agreement includes Senate direction. WIFIA Planning and Development. —The agreement only includes direction in the Ex-penses account. 
REGULATORY PROGRAM  The agreement includes $200,000,000 for the Regulatory Program. 
FORMERLY UTILIZED SITES REMEDIAL ACTION  
PROGRAM  The agreement includes $150,000,000 for the Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program. FLOOD CONTROL AND COASTAL EMERGENCIES The agreement includes $35,000,000 for Flood Control and Coastal Emergencies. 
EXPENSES  The agreement includes $193,000,000 for Ex-penses. Alternative financing.—The agreement in-cludes House direction and Senate direction under the heading ‘‘Public-Private Partner-ships’’ in the Construction account. Addi-tionally, funds above the budget request in this account are available, if needed, to im-plement House or Senate direction or to fur-ther efforts to develop a programmatic pro-posal on the WIFIA program for inclusion in a future budget submission. Inventory of Corps projects.—The agreement includes Senate direction with the clarifica-tion that the inventory is of existing and on-going studies and projects. 
OFFICE OF THE ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF THE  
ARMY FOR CIVIL WORKS  The agreement includes $5,000,000 for the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works. The agreement in-cludes legislative language that restricts the availability of funding until the Secretary submits a work plan that allocates at least 95 percent of the additional funding provided in each account (i.e., 95 percent of additional funding provided in Investigations, 95 per-cent of additional funding provided in Con-struction, etc.). This restriction shall not af-fect the roles and responsibilities established in previous fiscal years of the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, the Corps headquarters, the Corps field operating agencies, or any other execu-tive branch agency.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH8038 September 10, 2018 
TITLE IV—INDEPENDENT AGENCIES The budget request proposes to eliminate the Delta Regional Authority, Denali Com-mission, and Northern Border Regional Com-mission. The budget requests funding to con-duct closeout of the agencies in fiscal year 2019. Because Congress strongly opposes the termination of these agencies, the agree-ment includes funding to continue their ac-tivities. The Administration shall continue all activities funded by this Act as well as follow directive language included in this re-port. No funds shall be used for the planning of or implementation of termination of these agencies. A
PPALACHIAN REGIONAL COMMISSION  The conferees provide $165,000,000 for the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC). The agreement includes the following di-rection in lieu of all direction included in the House and Senate reports. To diversify and enhance regional business development, $10,000,000 is provided to con-tinue the program of high-speed broadband deployment in distressed counties within the Central Appalachian region that have been most negatively impacted by the downturn in the coal industry. This funding shall be in addition to the 30 percent directed to dis-tressed counties. Within available funds, $73,000,000 is pro-vided for base funds and $50,000,000 is for the POWER Initiative to support communities, primarily in Appalachia, that have been ad-versely impacted by the closure of coal-pow-ered generating plants and a declining coal industry by providing resources for economic diversification, job creation, job training, and other employment services. Within available funds, not less than $16,000,000 is provided for a program of indus-trial site and workforce development in Southern and South Central Appalachia, fo-cused primarily on the automotive supplier sector and the aviation sector. Up to $13,500,000 of that amount is provided for ac-tivities in Southern Appalachia. The funds shall be distributed to States that have dis-tressed counties in Southern and South Cen-tral Appalachia using the ARC Area Develop-ment Formula. Within available funds, the agreement pro-vides $16,000,000 for a program of basic infra-structure improvements in distressed coun-ties in Central Appalachia. Funds shall be distributed according to ARC’s distressed counties formula and shall be in addition to the regular allocation to distressed counties. In addition, the ARC is directed to engage in a partnership with a rural consortium that includes academic entities, rural health care providers, and economic development entities in order to develop information and data on overall agricultural and human health issues, how economic distress can be overcome through addressing these issues, and strategies for implementing solutions. The ARC is directed to provide to the Com-mittees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress not later than one year after the enactment of this Act a report describing ac-tivities in support of this effort. D
EFENSE NUCLEAR FACILITIES SAFETY BOARD  
SALARIES AND EXPENSES  The conferees provide $31,000,000 for the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board. The conferees include a provision that prohibits implementation of any reform or reorganiza-tion plan, including the plan announced on August 15, 2018, unless that plan is specifi-cally authorized in law. D
ELTA REGIONAL AUTHORITY  
SALARIES AND EXPENSES  The conferees provide $25,000,000 for the Delta Regional Authority (DRA). Within available funds, the agreement pro-vides not less than $10,000,000 for flood con-trol, basic public infrastructure develop-ment, and transportation improvements, which shall be allocated separate from the State formula funding method. The agree-ment does not include a statutory waiver with regard to DRA’s priority of funding. The DRA is further directed to focus on ac-tivities relating to basic public infrastruc-ture and transportation infrastructure be-fore allocating funding toward other priority areas. DENALI COMMISSION  The conferees provide $15,000,000 for the Denali Commission. N
ORTHERN BORDER REGIONAL COMMISSION  The conferees provide $20,000,000 for the Northern Border Regional Commission. Within available funds, not less than $4,000,000 is provided for initiatives that seek to address the decline in forest-based econo-mies throughout the region. The agreement includes legislative language regarding the management of the Northern Border Re-gional Commission in fiscal year 2019. S
OUTHEAST CRESCENT REGIONAL COMMISSION  The conferees provide $250,000 for the Southeast Crescent Regional Commission. N
UCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION  
SALARIES AND EXPENSES  The Commission’s mission is to ensure the safety and security of the nation’s use of nu-clear power and nuclear materials and pro-tect the workers and public who use and ben-efit from these materials and facilities. The agreement provides $898,350,000 for Nuclear Regulatory Commission (Commission) sala-ries and expenses. This amount is offset by estimated revenues of $770,477,000, resulting in a net appropriation of $127,873,000. The agreement includes $10,300,000 for activities related to the development of regulatory in-frastructure for advanced nuclear reactor technologies and $16,080,000 for international activities, which are not subject to the Com-mission’s general fee recovery collection re-quirements. The agreement directs the use of $20,000,000 in prior-year unobligated bal-ances. The agreement includes the following di-rection in lieu of all direction included in the House and Senate reports: Nuclear Reactor Safety.—The agreement in-cludes $469,767,000 for Nuclear Reactor Safe-ty. This control point includes the Commis-sion’s Operating Reactors and New Reactors business lines. Integrated University Program.—The agree-ment includes $15,000,000 for the Integrated University Program. Of this amount, $5,000,000 is to be used for grants to support projects that do not align with pro-grammatic missions but are critical to main-taining the discipline of nuclear science and engineering. Nuclear Materials and Waste Safety. —The agreement includes $108,609,000 for Nuclear Materials and Waste Safety. Included within this control point are the Fuel Facilities, Nuclear Material Users, and Spent Fuel Storage and Transportation business lines. Decommissioning and Low-Level Waste. —The agreement includes $25,393,000 for Decommis-sioning and Low-Level Waste. Corporate Support.—The agreement in-cludes $299,581,000 for Corporate Support. The agreement provides, within available funds, not more than $9,500,000 for the salaries, travel, and other support costs for the Office of the Commission. These salaries and ex-penses shall include only salaries and benefit and travel costs, and are not to include gen-eral, administrative, or infrastructure costs. The use and expenditure of these funds shall be jointly managed through majority vote of the Commission. The Commission shall con-tinue to include a breakout and explanation of the Commission salaries and expenses in its annual budget requests. If the Commis-sion wishes to change the composition of the funds in future years, it must do so in an an-nual budget request or through a reprogram-ming. Budget Execution Plan.—The Commission shall provide a specific budget execution plan to the Committees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress not later than 30 days after the enactment of this Act. The plan shall include details at the product line level within each of the control points. Unobligated Balances from Prior Appropria-tions.—The Commission carries unobligated balances from appropriations received prior to fiscal year 2018. The agreement requires the use of $20,000,000 of these balances, de-rived from fee-based activities. The Commis-sion is directed to apply these savings in a manner that continues to ensure the protec-tion of public health and safety and main-tains the effectiveness of the current inspec-tion program. Because the Commission has already collected fees corresponding to these activities in prior years, the agreement does not include these funds within the fee base calculation for determining authorized reve-nues and does not provide authority to col-lect additional offsetting receipts for their use. Any remaining unobligated balances carried forward from prior years are subject to the reprogramming guidelines in section 402 of the Act, and shall only be used to sup-plement appropriations consistent with those guidelines. Rulemaking.—The Commission shall submit to the Committees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress a list of all rulemaking activities planned, to include their priority, schedule, and actions taken to adhere to the backfit rule, in the annual budget request and the semi-annual report to Congress on li-censing and regulatory activities. Transformation Initiative.—The Trans-formation Initiative is intended to enhance the Commission’s ability to evaluate and regulate new and novel technologies—such as accident tolerant fuels, new materials and new manufacturing approaches, big data, digital instrumentation and controls, and small modular and advanced reactor de-signs—that will challenge the Commission’s current regulatory framework. In future budget requests, the Commission is directed to include concrete proposals developed under the Initiative and to reflect savings achieved from their implementation. Accident Tolerant Fuels.—Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Commission shall submit to the Commit-tees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress a plan describing the Commission’s activities with respect to the testing of ma-terials, the development of consensus stand-ards, and the validation of computer codes and how these activities will be integrated with the work of external organizations. The plan shall describe how the Advanced Test Reactor, the Transient Reactor Test Facil-ity, and the Halden Reactor support these ef-forts. Digital Instrumentation and Control .—Not later than 90 days after the date of enact-ment of this Act, the Commission shall sub-mit to the Committees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress a report describing approaches to permitting the use of digital instrumentation and control in safety appli-cations outside of the nuclear industry. The report shall discuss whether the permitting approaches used in non-nuclear applications would be acceptable in nuclear applications, and if not, explain why not. Reporting Requirements.—The agreement di-rects the Commission to continue to provide

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H8049 September 10, 2018 
DIVISION B—LEGISLATIVE BRANCH APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2019 The following is an explanation of the ef-fects of Division B, which makes appropria-tions for the Legislative Branch for fiscal year 2019. Unless otherwise noted, reference to the House and Senate reports are to House Report 115–696 and Senate Report 115–274. The language included in these reports should be complied with and carry the same emphasis as the language included in the ex-planatory statement, unless specifically ad-dressed to the contrary in this explanatory statement. While repeating some report lan-guage for emphasis, this explanatory state-ment does not intend to negate the language referred to above unless expressly provided herein. Reprogramming Guidelines: It is expected that all agencies notify the Committees on Appropriations of the House and the Senate of any significant departures from budget plans presented to the Committees in any agency’s budget justifications. In particular, agencies funded through this bill are re-quired to notify the Committees prior to each reprogramming of funds in excess of the lesser of 10 percent or $750,000 between pro-grams, projects or activities, or in excess of $750,000 between object classifications (ex-cept for shifts within the pay categories, ob-ject class 11, 12, and 13 or as further specified in each agency’s respective section). This in-cludes cumulative reprogrammings that to-gether total at least $750,000 from or to a par-ticular program, activity, or object classi-fication as well as reprogramming full time equivalents (FTE) or funds to create new or-ganizational entities within the agency or to restructure entities which already exist. The Committees desire to be notified of re-programming actions which involve less than the above-mentioned amounts if such actions would have the effect of changing an agency’s funding requirements in future years or if programs or projects specifically cited in the Committees’ reports are af-fected. Inspector General Budgets: The conferees be-lieve it is important to ensure independence between Legislative Branch Inspectors Gen-eral (IG) and their respective reporting agen-cies and expect to see a separate section in each agency’s fiscal year 2020 budget jus-tification reflecting a detailed budget re-quest for the agency’s IG Office. Addition-ally, the conferees direct each IG to keep the Committees fully apprised of its funding needs, and the conferees direct each agency not to interfere with or require approval for such communications. TITLE I SENATE The agreement includes $934,666,642 for Senate operations. This item relates solely to the Senate, and is in accordance with long practice under which each body determines its own housekeeping requirements and the other concurs without intervention. Senate Employees’ Child Care Center (SECCC): In lieu of language included in Sen-ate Report 115–274, the agreement directs the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to review the current operations of the SECCC. GAO must receive input from related con-stituencies including SECCC Board Members and the Executive Director. GAO shall con-duct a study and provide its findings to the Committee on Appropriations and the Com-mittee on Rules and Administration no later than 180 days after enactment of this act. The study shall: examine the current statu-tory impediments to and feasibility of incor-porating the SECCC into either the office of the Sergeant at Arms or the office of the Secretary of the Senate; the current costs to operate the facility, including capital, oper-ating, salaries, benefits and other expenses and how those might convey to one of the Senate entities named; investigate the cre-ation and operation of a revolving fund by which tuition and other payments may be re-ceived; detail the best method of dissolving the 501(c)(3) that currently runs the SECCC; and recommend a personnel process to gov-ern hires, transfers, promotions, and approv-als for training. The study should also in-clude an accounting of the SECCC’s require-ments to maintain certification and licens-ing as a certified and/or accredited child care and child development facility in the Dis-trict of Columbia. That accounting should also include any requirements for insurance or other liability protections for the staff or the facility. The study should disclose all costs associated with the operation of the center that are currently incurred by the SECCC, the Architect of the Capitol, the Senate Sergeant at Arms, and the Secretary of the Senate. When developing its findings, the Committee strongly encourages GAO to consider the structure and capacity of child care facilities that serve employees of other Legislative Branch agencies, the House of Representatives, and Executive Branch agen-cies. The conferees further direct the Comp-troller General to brief the Committee on Rules and Administration not later than 90 days after enactment on preliminary find-ings of the Comptroller General’s evaluation, with the report to follow at a date to be de-termined at the time of the briefing. In lieu of language included in Senate Re-port 115–274, the agreement includes the fol-lowing: Senate Staff Compensation Review: Ensuring Senate staff compensation is competitive and fair is critical to attracting and retain-ing highly-qualified staff. The Secretary of the Senate is directed to conduct a review, or contract with an independent external en-tity to conduct a review, of the salaries and benefits of staff employed by Senators’ of-fices and Senate Committees to evaluate the extent to which Senate staff receive similar pay for similar work, both internally and ex-ternally to the Senate. The review must con-sider job responsibilities, experience, and outside qualifications, including education, for such comparisons. Providing such com-pensation data is strictly voluntary for any Senator’s office or Senate Committee, and any such office may direct that its data be excluded from any data provided for the re-view. The review should note how many of-fices, in the aggregate, chose not to partici-pate. The Secretary, or contracting entity, must also take all reasonable and necessary steps to ensure that the data gathered is se-curely protected and kept confidential. The Committee directs that such a review be started, or contracted out, within 12 months of enactment and that a report summarizing such review be submitted, within 18 months of enactment, to the Committee on Appro-priations and upon request to any Senator. Such report must provide summaries of such comparisons and exclude any information that could be used to identify any individual, any Senators’ office, any Committee, or any other entity of the Senate, similar to reports published in 2001 and 2006. Senate Intern Compensation: The agreement reiterates directives included in Senate Re-port 115–274 related to Senate Intern Com-pensation and notes that $5,000,000 is pro-vided for such purpose. Death Gratuity: Consistent with tradition, the agreement provides $174,000 to the widow of Senator John Sidney McCain III. Administrative Provisions The agreement provides for unspent amounts remaining in Senators’ Official Per-sonnel and Office Expense Account to be used for deficit or debt reduction; amends the Federal Election Campaign Act relating to electronic filings; and extends the author-ity as provided for in section 21(d) of Senate Resolution 64 of the 113th Congress, as amended by section 178 of Public Law 114– 223. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES The agreement includes $1,232,663,035 for House operations. This item relates solely to the House, and is in accordance with long practice under which each body determines its own housekeeping requirements and the other concurs without intervention. Chief Administrative Office House Campus Food Service: The conferees commend the Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) for the addition of several branded op-tions to the House campus and encourage the CAO to continue exploring opportunities to add more. Members Dining Room (MDR): Dating back to 1858, the MDR has provided a social space where Members meet with one another and with their constituents. This is a unique and special experience for visitors of all ages. There have been ongoing concerns over the years regarding improvements to food serv-ice and quality in the MDR. The conferees direct the Chief Administrative Officer to ex-plore applying the branded option concept to the dining room in an effort to provide con-sistent service, better food selection, and quality food to Members and their guests. The CAO is to report back to the appro-priate stakeholders regarding options and timelines within 90 days. Office of the Legislative Counsel of the House Funding: The House Office of Legislative Counsel (HOLC) staffing has not increased proportionally to meet Member expectations for drafting assistance. The HOLC has re-cently experienced a loss of key personnel, including to the executive branch. While the current Legislative Counsel is to be com-mended for his strategic management ap-proach and successful recruitment of tal-ented personnel, the HOLC needs additional resources to hire and retain additional attor-neys, paralegals, and administrative staff. An additional $2,000,000 is provided so that HOLC will be better positioned over the long-term to meet its statutory responsi-bility and support Members and staff throughout the legislative process. The con-ferees specifically expect HOLC to ensure the availability of drafting assistance to Mem-bers, committees and leadership offices when legislative activity is expected or legislative deadlines are approaching. Paid Internships: The conferees believe that House internships should be available to the broadest possible pool of candidates who have the ability and interest to serve. Un-paid internships can be an impediment to otherwise qualified candidates who cannot independently afford to work without pay. One important step to expanding the oppor-tunity for public service within the House is to provide interns financial compensation via a salary. The underlying bill provides up to $20,000 per Member office for the sole purpose of paid internships. The paid internship posi-tions shall not count against the number of employees who may be employed by a Mem-ber of the House under 2 U.S.C. 5321. The Committee on House Administration will promulgate rules and regulations on the im-plementation of this new authority. Administrative Provisions The agreement provides for unspent amounts remaining in Members’ Representa-tional Allowances account to be used for def-icit or debt reduction; prohibits the delivery

APITOL POLICE  
SALARIES  The agreement includes $374,804,000 for sal-aries of the Capitol Police (USCP). The in-crease includes necessary half year funds to provide full year funding for those sworn hired from fiscal year 2018 funding to staff the House Garage Security initiative and limited prescreening; half year funding to fully fund 48 civilian positions hired from fis-cal year 2018 funding that will replace posi-tions currently staffed by sworn officers, who will be redeployed to meet critical mis-sion requirements and provide immediate personnel utility; and additional half year funds in fiscal year 2019 for the hiring of 72 sworn and 21 civilian positions for additional sworn prescreeners at office buildings and the implementation of enhanced screening at the Capitol Visitor Center, as well as one po-sition for the USCP Office of Inspector Gen-eral. No more than $43,668,000 is rec-ommended for overtime in fiscal year 2019. This provides for approximately 665,000 hours of additional duty. Risk-Based Protections for Members of Con-gress: As highlighted by the 2017 shooting in Alexandria, Virginia, evolving threats to Congress include the physical targeting of Members of Congress. In addition to securing the Capitol campus, the conferees find that ensuring the continuity of government must include protecting the physical security of Members. This bill includes $1,000,000 to en-hance Member security outside of the Cap-itol campus in the National Capital Region, as warranted by risk-based analyses. Such funds may be used to reimburse local law en-forcement and/or support additional dig-nitary protection teams to be assigned on a flexible and dynamic basis. The conferees further expect the USCP to adopt Inspector General recommendations on improving the effectiveness of USCP units, including those other than the Uniformed Services Bureau, to better position the USCP to expand off- campus security for Members. The USCP is directed to report to the Committees within 90 days of enactment on plans for utilizing the increased funding for off-campus Member security in the National Capital Region, in-cluding cost estimates for expanding such ef-forts. The USCP is also directed to include in such report a recommendation to the Com-mittees on specific features of such events that may warrant a threat assessment. Such recommendation should be made in a format that could better inform Members and staff of events that may need to be alerted to the USCP. Use of Grounds: The conferees understand the need to maintain safety and order on the Capitol grounds and the USCP is commended for their efforts. Given the family-style neighborhood that the Capitol shares with the surrounding community the conferees continue to instruct the Capitol Police to forebear enforcement of 2 U.S.C. 1963 (‘‘an act to protect the public property, turf, and grass of the Capitol Grounds from injury’’) and the Traffic Regulations for the United States Capitol Grounds when encountering snow sledders on the grounds. Horse Mounted Unit: For a period of time prior to fiscal year 2006 the USCP operated a six-person Horse Mounted Unit (HMU). The non-personnel start-up costs and annual op-erating budget required to have a dedicated USCP HMU at this time would take re-sources away from USCP priorities. How-ever, some believe that having a HMU occa-sionally patrol the Capitol campus could be beneficial both from an aesthetic and secu-rity perspective. The USCP is directed to provide a report to the Committees within 90 days of enactment that explores the possi-bility of entering into a memorandum of un-derstanding with the United States Park Po-lice (USPP) and the Metropolitan Police De-partment to provide HMU support around the Capitol campus. The report must address all aspects of such MOU, including any an-ticipated direct costs and any reimburse-ment payments. The report must also pro-vide a detailed analysis of the security im-provements that could be made under such an MOU, including accounting for the poten-tial frequency of USPP and MPD HMU pres-ence on the campus. USCP Office of Inspector General: The agree- ment includes funds to support not less than six FTEs within the USCP Office of Inspector General. G
ENERAL EXPENSES  The agreement includes $81,504,000 for gen-eral expenses of the Capitol Police. OFFICE OF COMPLIANCE  
SALARIES AND EXPENSES  The agreement includes $6,332,670 for sala-ries and expenses. Compliance and Training Additional Re-sources: The conferees recognize the contin-ued work on reforming the Congressional Ac-countability Act (CAA) and the process by which harassment and discrimination are re-ported in the workplace. In support of the ongoing CAA reform efforts and the increas-ing role and expectations of the Office of Compliance (OOC) including training of Leg-islative Branch offices and agencies, which includes the addition of the Library of Con-gress earlier this year, the agreement pro-vides an additional $1,373,670 above the fiscal year 2018 enacted level. C
ONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE  
SALARIES AND EXPENSES  The agreement includes $50,737,000 for sala-ries and expenses. Responsiveness to Congress: The Congres-sional Budget Office (CBO) provides Congress with estimates and analyses which can play an influential role in the legislative process. The conferees support the CBO’s initiatives to improve responsiveness to Congress. To better understand the needs of the agency with respect to these initiatives, the con-ferees request additional details and plans for current and future efforts. Specifically, the conferees request information pertaining to the allocation of time and resources spent on formal cost estimates versus informal cost estimates and an update on the agency’s plans to enhance the tracking of this infor-mation. A
RCHITECT OF THE CAPITOL  The agreement includes $733,745,000 for the activities of the Architect of the Capitol (AOC). Office of Inspector General (OIG): Within funds provided the conferees direct the AOC OIG to employ not fewer than 14 full-time equivalent positions during fiscal year 2019. C

Cannon Tunnel Improvements: The tunnel connecting the Cannon House Office Building and the Capitol Building is the path many visitors travel in route to visiting the Cap-itol. The current condition of the Cannon tunnel is that of a basement ambience. Fur-thermore the tunnel is subject to leaks which have recently caused the tunnel to be closed. The Architect of the Capitol, in con-sultation with the Clerk of the House, is di-rected to develop a comprehensive plan to enhance the tunnel. The plan should include cost estimates, timeline, and renderings to improve the welcoming experience as visi-tors make their way to the Capitol. Capitol South Metro Station Arrival Area: The conferees recognize the symbolism of the Capitol complex to our nation and around the world. A desire exists to make improvements to the welcoming experience as visitors arrive at the campus. The Archi-tect of the Capitol is directed to further study, evaluate, and develop designs for the transformation of First Street, SE into a more welcoming environment with specific improvements targeted to creating a safe and secure arrival area at the Capitol South Metro station.

APITOL VISITOR CENTER  The agreement includes $23,322,000 for the Capitol Visitor Center. 
ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS  The agreement prohibits payments of bo-nuses to contractors behind schedule or over budget; prohibits expenditure of funds for scrims for projects performed by the Archi-tect of the Capitol; allows interagency trans-fers of funds to support the security needs of Congress; amends the small purchase thresh-old; authorizes details of employees; and au-thorizes employees to accept reimbursement of expenses for attending meetings and other functions in an official capacity. Acceptance of Travel Expenses from Non-Fed-eral Sources: The Architect of the Capitol is directed to update its Ethics Order to incor-porate this new authority as well as includ-ing the requirement applicable to executive branch agencies that the Architect of the Capitol submit semi-annual reports on all expenses paid in amounts greater than $250. LIBRARY OF CONGRESS 
SALARIES AND EXPENSES  The agreement includes $474,052,000 in di-rect appropriations and authority to spend receipts of $6,000,000, for a total of $480,052,000. This amount includes $2,383,000 for the Vet-erans History Project and $8,653,000 for the Teaching with Primary Sources program. Visitor Experience: The vision for the Visitor Experience enhancements at the Library of Congress’ Thomas Jefferson Building has strong support in Congress. By expanding, revitalizing, and better showcasing the Li-brary’s available programs and historical ar-tifacts, the Visitor Experience will capitalize on investments in the Library while also opening up the Library’s treasures to more visitors from across the United States and the world. To date, $10,000,000 of taxpayer money has been appropriated and a commit-ment of $10,000,000 in private donations for this public/private partnership initiative has been secured. The preliminary cost estimate provided by the Library of Congress for this project is $60,000,000. The conferees believe a substantial down payment for this initiative has been invested which demonstrates the robust support and commitment of Congress. While one third of the funding for this initiative has been se-cured, routine budget justification mate-rials, such as a detailed cost estimate, de-sign, and timeline are still under develop-ment at the Library. As directed in Public Law 115–141 and its accompanying explana-tory statement, the Committees on Appro-priations of the House and Senate look for-ward to receiving and reviewing a com-prehensive Visitor Experience plan, which will provide the basis for appropriation of further project funding and ensure taxpayer dollars are being spent wisely. Ultimately this project has the potential to transform the way in which the collection and story of the world’s largest library is shared with millions of people for decades to come. The conferees applaud the forward thinking vision of the Visitor Experience con- cept and look forward to continuing Con-gress’ partnership with the Library of Con-gress to make this concept a reality. Preservation: The Library utilizes multiple preservation strategies to extend the life of its vast collections for future generations to enjoy, including building and operating cli-mate-controlled storage facilities, preparing new acquisitions for commercial binding and shelving, deacidification, and digital refor-matting. The conferees support the Library’s preservation efforts and direct the Library to continue funding for ongoing preservation activities at not less than the current level for each ongoing preservation strategy. National Film and Sound Recording Preserva-tion Programs: As noted in the Senate Report 115–274, the conferees expect that the Library will provide support to these programs. COPYRIGHT OFFICE 
SALARIES AND EXPENSES  The agreement includes $43,589,000 in direct appropriations to the Copyright Office which fully funds the agency’s amended request. An additional $45,490,000 is made available from receipts for salaries and expenses and $4,328,000 is available from prior year unobli-gated balances, for a total of $93,407,000. CONGRESSIONAL RESEARCH SERVICE 
SALARIES AND EXPENSES  The agreement includes $125,688,000 for sal-aries and expenses. Technology Assessment Study: The Commit-tees have heard testimony on, and received dozens of requests advocating for restoring funding to the Office of Technology Assess-ment, and more generally on how Congress equips itself with the deep technical advice necessary to understand and tackle the growing number of science and technology policy challenges facing our country. The conferees direct the Congressional Research Service (CRS) to engage with the National Academy of Public Administration or a simi-lar external entity to produce a report de-tailing the current resources available to Members of Congress within the Legislative Branch regarding science and technology policy, including the GAO. This study should also assess the potential need within the Legislative Branch to create a separate enti-ty charged with the mission of providing nonpartisan advice on issues of science and technology. Furthermore, the study should also address if the creation of such entity du-plicates services already available to Mem-bers of Congress. CRS should work with the Committees in developing the parameters of the study and once complete, the study should be made available to relevant over-sight Committees. BOOKS FOR THE BLIND AND PHYSICALLY HANDICAPPED SALARIES AND EXPENSES  The agreement includes $52,783,000 for sala-ries and expenses.

other services required by Congress. While the conferees support this efficient use of funds for these efforts, the conferees direct GPO to include such planned spending for fu-ture fiscal years in its agency budget jus-tifications. This will ensure that all future project and other spending planning by GPO will be transparent and justified to the Con-gress.

GOVERNMENT PUBLISHING OFFICE  
BUSINESS OPERATIONS REVOLVING FUND  The agreement includes $6,000,000. GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE 
SALARIES AND EXPENSES  The agreement includes $589,749,653 in di-rect appropriations for salaries and expenses of the Government Accountability Office (GAO). In addition, $35,900,000 is available from offsetting collections, for a total of $625,649,653. This level of funding will enable GAO to hire an additional 50 FTE compared to both the fiscal year 2018 funding level and the re-quest level. Added to GAO’s ongoing hiring plan, total staffing levels will increase by 130 FTE compared to the fiscal year 2018 level. Technology Assessment: There is general support in Congress to bolster capacity of and enhance access to quality, independent science and technological expertise. Since 2002, GAO has provided direct support to Congress in the area of technology assess-ment through objective, rigorous, and timely assessments of emerging science and tech-nologies. The Center for Science, Tech-nology, and Engineering (CSTE) within GAO has developed such a capacity, providing wide-ranging technical expertise across all of GAO’s areas of work. However, because the scope of technological complexities con-tinues to grow significantly, the conferees seek opportunities to expand technology as-sessment capacity within the Legislative Branch. The conferees encourage GAO to reorga-nize its technology and science function by creating a new more prominent office within GAO. GAO is directed to provide the Com-mittees a detailed plan and timeline describ-ing how this new office can expand and en-hance GAO’s capabilities in scientific and technological assessments. This plan should be developed in consultation with internal stakeholders of the Legislative Branch such as congressional staff and Members of Con-gress in addition to external stakeholders, including nonprofit organizations and sub-ject matter experts knowledgeable in the field of emerging and current technologies. Further, such a plan should include a de-scription of the revised organizational struc-ture within GAO, provide potential cost esti-mates as necessary, and analyze the fol-lowing issues: the appropriate scope of work and depth of analysis; the optimum size and staff skillset needed to fulfill its mission; the opportunity and utility of shared efficiencies within GAO; and the opportunities to in-crease GAO’s engagement and support with Congress. GAO is directed to submit this re-port to the Committees within 180 days of enactment. USCP Mandatory Retirement Age: The con- ferees direct the Government Accountability Office to provide a written report to the Committees within one year of enactment on the feasibility and impact of permanently raising the USCP sworn employee manda-tory retirement age from 57 years of age to 60 years of age. The report should address the young and vigorous law enforcement stand-ard; the potential impact to benefits afforded to USCP sworn employees under the Capitol Police Retirement Act, the Social Security benefit, the Federal Employees Retirement System benefit, and the Thrift Savings Plan annuity; the long-term financial impact on the USCP if enacted; and provide benchmark data against other Federal law enforcement agencies to ensure Federal law enforcement parity for the USCP will not be impacted should the mandatory retirement age be raised to 60 years of age. In addition, in con-sultation with the Office of Personnel Man-agement, the Government Accountability Office should provide amendment language to the Capitol Police Retirement Act for such a change to be made and validate that the ‘‘young and vigorous’’ basis of CPRA mandatory age retirement requirements is acceptable for the entire federal workforce given present-day health and wellness stand-ards. OPENWORLD LEADERSHIP CENTER TRUST  F
UND The agreement includes $5,600,000. Mission: The conferees applaud the Open World Leadership Center (OWLC) as it enters its twentieth year of operation. The high-light of OWLC’s accomplishments has been the engagement of program participants with United States Government officials, in-cluding Members of Congress, which helps to improve the image of the United States in countries where leaders have limited direct interface with Americans and our values. The political landscape around the world is constantly shifting, and Congress’s needs for dialogue with leaders around the world who shape America’s image in their own coun-tries is increasing. The conferees look for-ward to the OWLC being a continued and po-tentially growing resource for the initiation and ongoing means of dialogue with emerg-ing legislatures and/or countries undergoing governmental transition. The conferees di-rect OWLC to collaborate with its current Board of Directors as well as Congressional stakeholders to present a report outlining potential ways in which OWLC can meet its mission in an evolving world.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H8067 September 10, 2018 
DIVISION C—MILITARY CONSTRUCTION, VETERANS AFFAIRS, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2019 The following is an explanation of the ef-fects of Division C, which makes appropria-tions for Military Construction, Veterans Af-fairs, and Related Agencies for fiscal year 2019. Unless otherwise noted, reference to the House and Senate reports are to House Re-port 115–673 and Senate Report 115–269. The language set forth in House Report 115–673 and Senate Report 115–269 should be com-plied with and carry the same emphasis as the language included in the joint explana-tory statement, unless specifically addressed to the contrary in this joint explanatory statement. While repeating some report lan-guage for emphasis, this joint explanatory statement does not intend to negate the lan-guage referred to above unless expressly pro-vided herein. In cases in which the House or the Senate has directed the submission of a report, such report is to be submitted to both Houses of Congress. House or Senate report-ing requirements with deadlines prior to, or within 15 days after enactment of this Act shall be submitted no later than 60 days after enactment of this Act. All other report-ing deadlines not specifically directed by this joint explanatory statement are to be met. TITLE I DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE Bid Savings.—Cost variation notices re-quired by 10 U.S.C. 2853 continue to dem-onstrate the Department of Defense (DOD) continues to have bid savings on previously appropriated military construction projects. Therefore, the conference agreement in-cludes rescissions to the Air Force, Army National Guard, Homeowners Assistance Program, the NATO Security Investment Program and Navy and Marine Corps Family Housing accounts. The Secretary of Defense is directed to continue to submit 1002 reports on military construction bid savings at the end of each fiscal quarter to the Committees. Incremental Funding.—In general, the con-ferees support full funding for military con-struction projects if they are executable. However, it continues to be the practice of the Committees to provide incremental fund-ing for certain large projects to enable the services to more efficiently allocate military construction dollars among projects that can be executed in the year of appropriation. Therefore, the conference agreement in-cludes 9 projects that have been incremen-tally funded, however the full authorization of the projects will be provided in the Na-tional Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019. Facilities Sustainment, Restoration and Mod-ernization (FSRM).—The Department of De-fense is directed to continue describing on form 1390 the backlog of FSRM requirements at installations with future construction projects. For troop housing requests, form 1391 should describe any FSRM conducted in the past two years. Likewise, future require-ments for unaccompanied housing at the cor-responding installation should be included. Additionally, the forms should include English equivalent measurements for projects presented in metric measurement. Rules for funding repairs of facilities under the Operation and Maintenance accounts are described below: (1) components of the facility may be re-paired by replacement. Such replacement can be up to current standards or codes; (2) interior arrangements and restorations may be included as repair; (3) additions, new facilities, and functional conversions must be performed as military construction projects. Such projects may be done concurrently with repair projects as long as the final conjunctively funded project is a complete and usable facility; and (4) the appropriate service secretary shall notify the appropriate committees 21 days prior to carrying out any repair project with an estimated cost in excess of $7,500,000. The Committees strongly encourage the services and defense agencies to indicate the plant re-placement value of the facility to be repaired on each such notification. Enhancing force protection and security on military installations.—In collaboration with the House Armed Services Committee, the conference agreement includes section 132 which provides $50,000,000 to each of the mili-tary construction accounts for Navy and Ma-rine Corps and the Air Force to help allevi-ate deficiencies in access control points, air traffic control towers, fire stations, and AT/ FP deficiencies across the enterprise. There has been much concern on both sides of the aisle that these types of military construc-tion projects continually fall short of secur-ing funding in a fiscal year due to higher pri-orities within the Services. Each Service Secretary is directed to submit a spend plan for the additional funds no later than 30 days after enactment of this Act to the congres-sional defense committees. Cell Site Simulators.—The conferees are con-cerned with the potential threat of cell site simulators located near DOD facilities. Therefore, the conferees direct the Secretary of Defense to submit to the congressional de-fense committees within 180 days of enact-ment of this Act a full accounting of cell site simulators detected near DOD facilities dur-ing the three year period ending on the date of enactment of this Act. The report should also include the actions taken by the Sec-retary to protect personnel of the Depart-ment, their families, and facilities of the De-partment from foreign powers using such technology to conduct surveillance. US Army Corps of Engineers restructuring (USACE).—On July 30, 2018, the Secretary of Defense approved a Secretary of the Army memorandum identifying specific actions the Army will take in support of the Admin-istration’s proposed reorganization of USACE’s Civil Works Program. The reorga-nization includes taking the Civil Works pro-gram out of the Army Corps of Engineers with navigation going to the Department of Transportation for infrastructure grants and the remaining accounts to the Department of Interior. The conferees are perplexed as to why there was no notification or discussion with Members of Congress and Committees staffs on an action of this magnitude that crosses multiple subcommittees’ jurisdiction. This type of proposal, as the Department is well aware, will require legislative language which has not been proposed or requested to date. The conferees are opposed to the reor-ganization as it could ultimately have im-pacts for implementation of the Military Construction, BRAC and Family Housing programs. M
ILITARY CONSTRUCTION , ARMY The conference agreement provides $1,021,768,000 for Military Construction, Army. Within this amount, the agreement provides $110,068,000 for study, planning, de-sign, architect and engineer services, and host nation support. The agreement also pro-vides an additional $10,000,000 above the re-quest to supplement unspecified minor mili-tary construction. Sunflower Army Ammunition Plant. —Con- sistent with the direction in the Senate Re-port 115–269, the conferees direct the Army to continue its remediation and evaluations at the former Sunflower Army Ammunition Plant, comply with applicable regulations and permit requirements, and work with reg-ulatory agencies to ensure all response sites are remediated to applicable and approved standards. The Army should continue to communicate with Sunflower Redevelop-ment, LLC and conduct regular stakeholder meetings and monthly conference calls to address questions or issues related to clean-up and redevelopment. Badger Army Ammunition Plant.—Consistent with the direction in the Senate Report 115– 269, the conferees direct the Army to con-tinue to test, using both aggregate and chemical-specific methods, for emerging con-taminants subject to an EPA Health Advi-sory Level at the former Badger Army Am-munition Plant, in nearby surface waters, and in drinking water in affected sur-rounding communities. The Army is directed to provide to local stakeholders the results of that testing and, if testing results show threats to human health, a plan to remediate the contamination, including dedicated fund-ing resources, schedule, and specific actions. Conveyance of property.—The conferees note that the Army is proposing to convey 17.1 acres of land known as Shenandoah Square and the 126 existing housing units to raise capital to improve other military housing owned by private entities. Under the pro-posed action, the existing 126 housing units would be demolished to allow for the con-struction of high-density residential hous-ing. The residents have expressed concern about the displacement from Shenandoah Square as it is in one of the most expensive housing markets in the country and the un-certainty about the affordability of new po-tential housing on the site. Therefore, the conferees urge the Department of the Army to explore all possible alternatives to a con-veyance of Shenandoah Square, including a sublease of the property to an entity that can better develop affordable housing on the property. MILITARY CONSTRUCTION , NAVY AND MARINE  C
ORPS  The conference agreement provides $2,118,619,000 for Military Construction, Navy and Marine Corps. Within this amount, the conference agreement provides $185,542,000 for study, planning, design, architect and en-gineer services. M
ILITARY CONSTRUCTION , AIRFORCE  The conference agreement provides $1,440,323,000 for Military Construction, Air Force. Within this amount, the conference agreement provides $206,577,000 for study, planning, design, architect and engineer services. Little Rock Air Force Base.—As described in the Senate report 115–269, the conferees di-rect the Secretary of the Air Force to submit a report coordinated with the Army Corps of Engineers no later than 90 days after enact-ment of this Act providing the status on the cancelled runway project at Little Rock AFB and the replacement project, including what happened to the funding used for the original contract, a justification for the increase in cost for the new project, if any of the com-pleted work from the cancelled project is sal-vageable, how the Air Force is resolving the issues that led to contract termination and ensuring, to the extent possible, that they are not repeated in follow-on contracts, and how and when a future project will be fund-ed. Additionally, the conferees direct the Air Force to appoint a senior official who shall be responsible for the project and will pro-vide quarterly project updates to the con-gressional defense committees. Air Force Weapons Storage Facility Re-programming.—On July 9, 2018, the Depart-ment of Defense sent the Committees a re-programming request that included source funds from a cancelled prior year project, which the conferees had each rescinded in

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH8068 September 10, 2018 
their respective bills. The conferees recog-nize the importance of the Weapons Storage Facility (WSF) modernization program, but are concerned that the Department has po-tentially developed improper and unneces-sary requirements that are leading to execu-tion delays and cost overruns against an al-ready strained military construction budget. This has resulted in schedule delays to fol-low on projects, which also may experience similar challenges unless corrective action is taken. The conferees encourage the Depart-ment to sufficiently solicit and incorporate input from all stakeholders in developing re-quirements, to include the Air Force Stra-tegic Deterrence and Nuclear Integration di-rectorate, and further encourage the Air Force to incorporate lessons learned from prior Navy WSF modernization efforts. The conferees direct the Department to provide quarterly briefings to update the Commit-tees on status, requirements changes, and timeline updates for current and future projects associated with the WSF moderniza-tion program. The conferees urge the Depart-ment to expeditiously seek alternative fund-ing sources for the current reprogramming from unobligated balances or bid savings to avoid further execution delays. M
ILITARY CONSTRUCTION , DEFENSE -WIDE 
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)  The conference agreement provides $2,550,728,000 for Military Construction, De-fense-Wide. Within this amount, the con-ference agreement provides $192,345,000 for study, planning, design, architect and engi-neer services. Parking issues at DOD facilities.—The con- ferees are concerned that Military Construc-tion budget constraints are negatively af-fecting the ability of the Department of De-fense to address urgent parking require-ments at certain U.S. military installations. The lack of parking is a safety issue and a detriment to the well-being of employees, both civilian and military. The conferees are concerned that the Department does not have a coherent strategy to address the growing parking requirements at installa-tions that have seen significant growth. For example, Fort Meade, which already was home to the National Security Agency, be-came the headquarters of the newly formed U.S. Cyber Command in 2010. By 2011, the De-fense Information Systems Agency, which handles the Pentagon’s IT and communica-tions needs, had moved onto the base. In 2005, the base had just over 33,500 employees. Today, it has about 57,000, more than double the number of workers at the Pentagon. As a result of this growth, parking at Fort Meade has become a serious issue. Therefore, the conferees direct the Secretary of Defense to submit to the Committees with the fiscal year 2020 military construction budget re-quest: an updated list of unfunded require-ments for parking facilities, access control points, and road construction at DOD facili-ties that have serious parking, access, and road congestion issues. Finally, the Sec-retary is further directed to submit, with the fiscal year 2020 military construction budget request, a list of how those requirements will be incorporated into their construction re-quests for fiscal years 2021 through 2025. MIT/Lincoln Labs.—The conferees have in-crementally funded the Air Force MIT/Lin-coln Lab project commensurate with the outlay rate of funds for fiscal year 2019 as re-flected in budget documents. While the con-ference agreement does not provide full fund-ing for this project, the conferees strongly support MIT/Lincoln Labs mission and its completion. The conferees fully expect the Air Force to continue to prioritize funding for this project in executable increments. Energy Resilience and Conservation Invest-ment Program (ERCIP).—The conference agreement provides $193,390,000 for ERCIP, an increase of $43,390,000 over the budget re-quest to fund the top six unfunded require-ments of the program for energy resilience. Also, an additional $5,000,000 is provided under the Defense-Wide planning and design account specifically for ERCIP. The Sec-retary of Defense is directed to submit to the congressional defense committees a spend plan for the additional ERCIP funds, to in-clude the planning and design funds, no later than 30 days after enactment of this Act. MILITARY CONSTRUCTION , ARMYNATIONAL  G
UARD  The conference agreement provides $190,122,000 for Military Construction, Army National Guard. Within this amount, the conference agreement provides $16,622,000 for study, planning, design, architect and engi-neer services. The conference agreement also provides an additional $10,000,000 above the budget request to supplement unspecified minor military construction. M
ILITARY CONSTRUCTION , AIRNATIONAL  G

ILITARY CONSTRUCTION , ARMYRESERVE  The conference agreement provides $64,919,000 for Military Construction, Army Reserve. Within this amount, the conference agreement provides $5,855,000 for study, plan-ning, design, architect and engineer services. M
ILITARY CONSTRUCTION , NAVYRESERVE  The conference agreement provides $43,065,000 for Military Construction, Navy Reserve. Within this amount, the conference agreement provides $4,695,000 for study, plan-ning, design, architect and engineer services. M
ILITARY CONSTRUCTION , AIRFORCE RESERVE  The conference agreement provides $38,063,000 for Military Construction, Air Force Reserve. Within this amount, the con-ference agreement provides $4,055,000 for study, planning, design, architect and engi-neer services. N
ORTH ATLANTIC TREATY ORGANIZATION  S
ECURITY INVESTMENT PROGRAM  The conference agreement provides $171,064,000 for the North Atlantic Treaty Or-ganization Security Investment Program. D
EPARTMENT OF DEFENSE BASECLOSURE  A
CCOUNT  The conference agreement provides $342,000,000 for the Department of Defense Base Closure Account, an increase of $74,462,000 above the request. The additional funding is for the Department to accelerate environmental remediation at installations closed under previous Base Realignment and Closure rounds. Navy Clean Up Cost.—The conference report provides an additional $60,462,000 for the Navy to accelerate environmental remedi-ation at installations closed under previous Base Closure and Realignment rounds. Fur-thermore, the Navy shall provide to the Committees a spend plan for these additional funds no later than 30 days after enactment of this Act. Perfluorooctane Sulfonate (PFOS) and Perfluorooctanoic Acid (PFOA). —The con- ference report provides $14,000,000 in addi-tional funds for identification, mitigation, and clean-up costs across the Department of Defense for PFOS and PFOA. DOD is di-rected to submit a spend plan for these addi-tional funds to the Committees no later than 30 days after enactment of this Act. D
EMOLITION OF PREVIOUS BRAC F ACILI -
TIES.—The conferees are concerned that the Department of Defense does not have an ade-quate plan for demolishing previous BRAC sites. For example, the Ontario International Airport was the Ontario Air National Guard Station that was established in 1949. This fa-cility remained in operation for decades, as-sisting training and support for the Korean, Vietnam, and countless other wars and con-flicts. In 1997, the facility was closed, yet the old site has sat largely unchanged for 20 years due to the environmental hazards of demolition. The conferees urge the Depart-ment to dedicate funds to demolish BRAC fa-cilities and turn the land over to the local community as quickly as possible. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE FAMILY HOUSING  
ITEM OF INTEREST  Military family housing units.—The con- ferees are concerned for the well-being of servicemembers and their families residing in on-post military housing with regard to their exposure to toxic levels of lead based paint. It has been reported that installations around the country possess housing units that contain lead based paint levels exceed-ing the federal threshold for acceptable lev-els and could have grave implications on servicemembers and their families’ health. In addition, the conferees are interested in what steps the Department is taking for oversight of DOD privatized family housing. Therefore, the conferees direct the DOD In-spector General to conduct an investigation and submit a report to the congressional de-fense committees on toxic lead levels at military housing on all installations no later than 90 days after the enactment of this Act.

TITLE II DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS V
ETERANS BENEFITS ADMINISTRATION  
COMPENSATION AND PENSIONS  
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)  The conference agreement provides $109,017,152,000 for Compensation and Pen-sions in advance for fiscal year 2020. Of the amount provided, not more than $18,047,000 is to be transferred to General Operating Ex-penses, Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) and Information Technology Systems for reimbursement of necessary expenses in implementing provisions of title 38. The con-ference agreement also provides $2,994,366,000 for fiscal year 2019 in addition to the advance appropriation provided last year. 
READJUSTMENT BENEFITS  The conference agreement provides $14,065,282,000 for Readjustment Benefits in advance for fiscal year 2020. 
VETERANS INSURANCE AND INDEMNITIES  The conference agreement provides $111,340,000 for Veterans Insurance and In-demnities in advance for fiscal year 2020. 
VETERANS HOUSING BENEFIT PROGRAM FUND  The conference agreement provides such sums as may be necessary for costs associ-ated with direct and guaranteed loans for the Veterans Housing Benefit Program Fund. The conference agreement limits obligations for direct loans to not more than $500,000 and provides that $200,612,000 shall be available for administrative expenses. 
VOCATIONAL REHABILITATION LOANS PROGRAM  
ACCOUNT  The conference agreement provides $39,000 for the cost of direct loans from the Voca-tional Rehabilitation Loans Program Ac-count, plus $396,000 to be paid to the appro-priation for General Operating Expenses, Veterans Benefits Administration. The con-ference agreement provides for a direct loan limitation of $2,037,000. 
NATIVE AMERICAN VETERAN HOUSING LOAN  
PROGRAM ACCOUNT  The conference agreement provides $1,163,000 for administrative expenses of the Native American Veteran Housing Loan Pro-gram Account. 
GENERAL OPERATING EXPENSES , VETERANS  
BENEFITS ADMINISTRATION  The conference agreement provides $2,956,316,000 for General Operating Expenses, Veterans Benefits Administration and, of the amount provided, not to exceed 10 percent is available for obligation until September 30, 2020. The conference agreement provides $87,407,000 above the request to manage dis-ability claims and appeals backlogs and the intent of the conference agreement is that these additional funds be used for the Vet-erans Claims Intake Program; additional claims and appellate staff; increased staff for the Vocational Rehabilitation and Employ-ment program; and overtime payments, as necessary. Claims prioritization.—As indicated in the House report, VA is urged to prioritize the most vulnerable veterans, such as those who are elderly or in poor health, for initial claims processing and claims appeals. Medical disability exams.—As described in the Senate report, VA is directed to ensure that any non-VA physician contracted to conduct medical disability examinations have a current unrestricted license to prac-tice as a physician, and is not barred from practicing in any State, the District of Co-lumbia, or a Commonwealth, Territory, or possession of the United States. Equitable relief.—As described in the House report, the Secretary is directed to continue to grant or extend equitable relief to eligible veterans initially deemed eligible in in-stances of administrative error. VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION MEDICAL SERVICES  The conference agreement provides $51,411,165,000 in advance for fiscal year 2020 for Medical Services and makes $1,500,000,000 of the advance available through fiscal year 2021. The conference agreement also provides $750,000,000 for fiscal year 2019 in addition to the advance appropriation provided last year and includes bill language requiring the Sec-retary to ensure that sufficient amounts are available for the acquisition of prosthetics designed specifically for female veterans. Opioid abuse.—The conference agreement provides $348,000,000 for opioid treatment and prevention programs and $52,025,000 to con-tinue to implement opioid safety initiatives outlined as part of the Comprehensive Addic-tion and Recovery Act, as well as to develop programs aimed at ensuring that non-VA providers treating veterans through commu-nity care programs are informed and in com-pliance with all VA standards for opioid safe-ty and prescription guidelines. The con-ference agreement also includes $270,000,000 for the Office of Rural Health’s Rural Health Initiative, which funds several pilot projects aimed at treating and preventing opioid abuse, including projects focused on alter-natives to opioid-centered pain management in rural, highly rural, and remote areas; and $54,337,000 for the Justice Outreach Homeless Prevention program within the VA’s Vet-erans Homelessness Programs which among other things ensures that veterans encoun-tered by police, in jails or courts, have time-ly access to substance abuse treatment or prevention programs and services. The conferees direct VA to ensure that all clinicians, including pharmacists, receive guidance on assessing the risks and benefits of critical drug interactions with opioids when a pharmacist overrides such inter-action under section 913 of Public Law 114–98. The conferees urge VA to ensure that all VA providers who prescribe opioids consistently use the Opioid Therapy Risk Report tool under the Opioid Safety Initiative, including prior to initiating opioid therapy, to ensure safe prescribing, and to help prevent diver-sion, abuse, and double-prescribing. More-over, VA should further improve the timeli-ness of data available in the tool to allow real-time access to data on a patient who was prescribed opioid therapy by another fa-cility, in another State, or by mail order to prevent overprescribing and abuse potential. As noted in the House report, VA is urged to assist the two States that have not installed the technology to exchange data from their State prescription drug monitoring boards with VA. The conferees urge robust imple-mentation of VA’s plan to expand the scope of research, education, delivery, and integra-tion of Complementary and Integrative Health into the health care services. In addi-tion, the conferees urge VA to prioritize con-tinued implementation of the reforms made to the patient advocacy program as required by the Jason Simcakoski Memorial and Promise Act (Title IX, Public Law 114–98). Furthermore, VA is urged to implement re-cent GAO recommendations to improve over-sight of the controlled substance inspection program and to document its progress; as well as Office of the Inspector General rec-ommendations, including ensuring that com-munity care providers review the safe opioid prescribing guidelines and Opioid Safety Ini-tiative protocols and implementing a process to provide community care providers a com-plete up-to-date list of medications and med-ical history of the veteran during non-VA care consults. The conferees also direct the Department to create an opioid abuse healthcare kit for community healthcare providers and ensure completion of a con-tinuing medication course in pain manage-ment by providers at VA health facilities. Lastly, all directives contained in House Re-port 115–673 and Senate Report 115–269 not specifically addressed above shall be com-plied with. Mental health.—The conference agreement provides $8,618,628,000 for mental health pro-grams and includes $206,128,000 for suicide prevention outreach, an increase of $16,128,000 above the request. To best meet the needs of veterans seeking assistance, the conferees instruct the Secretary to make any necessary improvements to Veterans Crisis Line (VCL) operations including, but not limited to, ensuring appropriate staffing for call centers and back-up centers, pro-viding necessary training for VCL staff, and ensuring that staff are able to appropriately and effectively respond to the needs of vet-erans needing assistance. The conferees also direct the Secretary to provide the Commit-tees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress a report, no later than 90 days after enactment of this Act, which contains an up-date detailing findings on the outcomes and efficacy of the VCL from the Veterans Crisis Line Study Act of 2017. In addition, the con-ferees urge VA to increase support for pri-mary care-mental health integration and re-covery models, expand telemental health services, build on success of evidence-based psychotherapy initiatives, and guide treat-ment decisions by measuring the outcomes of interventions. National Center for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.—The conference agreement pro-vides $40,000,000 for the National Center for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (NCPTSD). The conferees direct the Department to sub-mit to the Committees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress, no later than 90 days after enactment of this Act, an assess-ment of the additional full time staff needed to carry out the priorities of the NCPTSD, as described in the congressional budget jus-tification, as well as a hiring plan, and a plan for ensuring that all community care mental health providers receive information about NCPTSD and its consultation pro-gram. Inpatient substance abuse.—As indicated in the House report, VA is urged to focus on re-ducing the burdensome wait times for vet-erans seeking inpatient substance abuse treatment. Non-citizen veteran outreach.—As stated in the House report, VA is urged to conduct more aggressive outreach to at-risk, non-cit-izen veterans to offer mental health coun-seling and other early intervention drug and alcohol services. Licensed professional mental health coun-selors and marriage and family therapists. —As stated in the Senate report, VA is directed to work with the Office of Personnel Manage-ment to create an Occupational Series for Licensed Professional Mental Health Coun-selors and Marriage and Family Therapists and to create a staffing plan to fill such open positions and assess shortages. Homeless assistance programs.—The con- ference agreement provides $1,818,534,000 for homeless assistance programs, which in-cludes $380,000,000 for the homeless sup-portive services for low income veterans and families, a level which is $60,000,000 above the request. Additionally, the agreement in-cludes $54,337,000 for Justice Outreach Home-less Prevention Program, $5,000,000 above the request. The conferees expect the Depart-ment to dedicate funding for VA’s Homeless Assistance Programs consistent with the in-creases described in this agreement and with Congressional Justifications which were

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H8083 September 10, 2018 
transmitted with the fiscal year 2019 budget request and not to divert the resources to other areas. The conferees direct that notifi-cation should be provided to the Committees of any reprogramming of funding provided for Homeless Assistance Programs. Lastly, all directives contained in House Report 115– 673 and Senate Report 115–269 not specifically addressed above shall be complied with. Veteran Homelessness in the Greater Los An-geles Region.—As indicated in the Senate re-port, VA is directed to provide a report out-lining the cost and feasibility of contracting with local community-based agencies and non-profit organizations to provide addi-tional case management services in regions where the Department does not meet the rec-ommended 25:1 case management staffing ratio. Construction assistance for nonprofit organi-zations.—As described in the House report, VA is urged to assess the possibility of as-sisting nonprofit organizations with capital costs related to the construction of new housing units for homeless veterans on non- VA property, particularly those utilizing De-partment of Housing and Urban Develop-ment-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (HUD–VASH) vouchers. Rural healthcare.—The conference agree-ment provides $270,000,000 for the Office of Rural Health (ORH) and the Rural Health Initiative, which is $20,000,000 above the President’s request, and VA is encouraged to use some of these additional funds to in-crease the number of Rural Health Resource Centers as a means of increasing access to care for veterans in rural areas. In addition, VA is encouraged to expand evidence-based home-based primary care programs to addi-tional American Indian reservations and other rural areas. Increased access also re-quires a sufficient number of healthcare pro-viders and the conferees are concerned about the ability of VA to adequately recruit and retain sufficient numbers of these providers in rural areas. As such, VA is urged to adopt the recommendations in GAO report GAO– 18–124 and encouraged to consider the ex-panded use of doctors of osteopathic medi-cine, physician assistants, and nurse practi-tioners to help address any rural health pro-vider gap. Any such gap may be further miti-gated through the use of telehealth for med-ical services. As indicated in the Senate re-port, the Secretary is directed to sustain continuity of care for rural veterans through provider agreements, based on previous mod-els such as the Access Received Closer to Home program, to ensure veterans do not ex-perience a lapse in existing healthcare access during the transition to the new community care program and any resulting integrated networks. Also, as indicated in the Senate report, the conference agreement directs no less than $4,000,000 to continue a pilot pro-gram to train veterans in agricultural voca-tions, while also tending to behavioral and mental health needs with behavioral healthcare services and treatments from li-censed providers at no fewer than three loca-tions. To further support veterans in rural areas, the conferees urge the VA to increase accessibility in rural communities to the Community Clergy Training to Support Rural Veterans Mental Health Initiative. The Department is also encouraged to im-prove partnerships with local faith-based or-ganizations, as well as the Department of Defense, in conjunction with the ‘‘Strong Bonds’’ program. Telemedicine.—The conference agreement includes $30,000,000 above the budget request for telehealth capabilities and this addi-tional funding should be used to further ex-pand telehealth capacity and services in rural and remote areas. To better assess VA’s efforts regarding the use of telehealth capabilities, the conferees direct VA to pro-vide a report to the Committees on Appro-priations of both Houses of Congress, no later than January 31, 2019, specifying meas-ures the Department is taking to expand telehealth and telemental health capabilities in rural areas, particularly regions with lim-ited broadband access. The report should also include information on any ongoing col-laboration between VA and other Federal agencies to target remote and rural areas to maximize coverage. Readjustment counseling service.—In Public Law 115–141, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018, the Department was provided $2,500,000 and directed to develop a program to partner with organizations that provide outdoor experiences for veterans as part of a continuum of care to treat combat-related injuries. The conferees direct the Depart-ment to provide an update on the status of this program to the Committees on Appro-priations of both Houses of Congress no later than 30 days after enactment of this Act. Utilization of healthcare services by veterans in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa, Guam, and the Freely Associated States.—As described in the Senate report, VA is directed to provide to the Com-mittees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress a strategic plan to implement and improve the utilization of healthcare serv-ices for veterans in outlying areas through piloting the expansion of health services via telehealth or other community care pro-viders. Women’s health.—The conferees note that the number of female veterans continues to increase. In response to this growth the con-ference agreement provides $521,352,000, $10,000,000 above the request, for gender-spe-cific care and for the continuing redesign of VA’s women’s healthcare delivery system and facilities to ensure women receive equi-table, timely, and high-quality care. This in-cludes privacy and environment of care issues for female veterans as highlighted in a 2016 GAO report. As described in the Senate report, VA is directed to submit a report on retrofitting facilities to eliminate barriers to care for women veterans to the Commit-tees on Appropriations and the Committees on Veterans’ Affairs of both Houses of Con-gress within 180 days of enactment of this Act. The conferees also continue to urge VA to ensure the gender-specific health needs of female veterans are met and continue its ef-forts to expand access to care for female vet-erans in areas such as obstetrics and gyneco-logical care, treatment for gender-specific conditions and diseases, and female veteran suicide. The conferees strongly believe that in order to ensure that female veterans needs are met VA must make the hiring of more fe-male healthcare professionals a top priority. Therefore, the conferees reiterate the guid-ance provided in House Report 115–673 direct-ing VA to provide statistics on female healthcare professionals at the Department. Intimate partner violence program. —As de- scribed in the Senate report, VA is directed to fully resource the VA Intimate Partner Violence Program at $17,000,000 in fiscal year 2019 and include it as a program of interest with budget detail in the justifications ac-companying the fiscal year 2020 budget sub-mission. Breast cancer screening guidelines.—The con- ferees support the Department’s effort to en-sure that the breast cancer screening guide-lines are consistent with the private sector, and the Committees will continue to mon-itor the Department’s implementation of its policy to offer mammograms to female vet-erans starting at age 40. The Department should closely follow ongoing debate as the scientific community reaches a consensus on breast cancer screening and mammography coverage to provide veterans the best care possible. The bill language that was included in the House bill stands to ensure VA main-tains this policy through fiscal year 2024. Rare cancers.—The conferees direct VA to assess options for modifying the December 2017 collaboration agreement between VA, the Department of Defense, and the National Cancer Institute to include collaboration on rare cancers. The conferees also encourage VA to fund research in delivering treatments for rare cancers that take a platform-agnos-tic approach to developing new therapeutics. Colorectal cancer screening.—The conferees are dismayed by VA’s failure to comply with the direction in the fiscal year 2018 Joint Ex-planatory Statement to offer all seven colorectal cancer screening strategies rec-ommended as A-rated modalities by the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPTF) and adopted by the National Committee for Quality Assurance Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set measures. While VA endorsed six screening strategies, it declined to endorse stool DNA screening, a widely used screening strategy. This makes VA an outlier within the medical community and the growth in community care will widen the gap between the screen-ing tools used by VA and non-VA providers. To ensure the inclusion of this critical tool in the fight against cancer in veterans, the conferees direct VA to endorse all seven mo-dalities for colorectal cancer screening. Home dialysis.—Approximately 20,000 vet-erans with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) receive their dialysis care from a VA Center, either directly or via contract with a dialy-sis provider. The Committee directs that the VA provide a report on how many patients receive home dialysis via peritoneal dialysis and home hemodialysis, if the number of pa-tients has increased over the past 5 years, and if the VA has set any use increase tar-gets for home dialysis use among its ESRD patients. National Intrepid Center of Excellence Sat-ellite Strategic Basing.—As described in the Senate report, VA is directed to study the value and merit to establishing a joint De-partment of Defense/Department of Veteran Affairs National Intrepid Center of Excel-lence Intrepid Spirit Center that serves both the active duty and veteran populations for the mutual benefit and growth in treatment and care for traumatic brain injury. The study will be reported to the Committees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress no later than 180 days after enactment of this Act. Long-term care.—The conference agreement provides $9,024,330,000 as requested for long- term care, of which $6,168,524,000 is for insti-tutional care and $2,855,806,000 is for non-in-stitutional care. Caregivers program.—The conferees believe that VA will incur obligations for the care-givers program totaling at least $865,000,000 in fiscal year 2019. Costs could be higher than this level depending on the implementation of new requirements in recently passed legis-lation. VA is directed to provide quarterly projections and monthly expenditure reports for the caregivers program to the Commit-tees. If VA does not obligate this amount of funding for caregivers based on quarterly projections, the Department is directed to report the rationale for the discrepancy to the Committees. No later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the De-partment is instructed to provide a report on the number of coordinators of caregiver sup-port services at each VA medical center, the number of staff assigned to appeals for the program at each medical center, and a deter-mination by the Secretary of the appropriate staff-to-participant ratio for the program. Hospice care for veterans.—As noted in the House and Senate reports, the conferees view

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH8084 September 10, 2018 
the implementation of hospice care protocols tailored to the unique end-of-life care needs of combat veterans as potentially beneficial for Vietnam-era veterans, as well as for Af-ghanistan, Iraq, and Syria veterans in the fu-ture. Therefore, the conference agreement includes $1,000,000 for the implementation of a pilot program to develop the techniques, best practices and support mechanisms to serve these veterans. As part of this pilot program, VA is encouraged to engage non- profit hospice and palliative care providers with Vietnam veteran-centric programs. The conferees also direct VA to provide the Com-mittees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress a report, not later than 180 days after enactment of this Act, on the status of the pilot program. Nursing home quality ratings.—To ensure transparency and accountability for veterans and their families in regard to nursing home care, the conferees direct VA to publish an-nually the quality of care rating assigned by the Department to each of its nursing homes and contracted community nursing homes. Call routing.—The conferees are concerned by reports that veterans calling their com-munity-based outpatient clinics (CBOC) to make an appointment are sometimes auto-matically routed to central call centers at VA medical centers with no follow-up by the CBOCs after the initial call. As a result, vet-erans may feel the need to physically visit the CBOC just to make an appointment. This is an unreasonable burden and may result in veterans not pursuing the care that they need. The conferees believe that our veterans deserve timely access to healthcare services and should be able to make their medical ap-pointments via telephone. Therefore, the conferees urge the VA to ensure that VA phone systems allow veterans to call their local CBOC directly for appointments at those facilities rather than having their calls routed to a call center. The conferees further direct VA to provide to the Committees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress a report, not later than 90 days after enact-ment of this Act, which explains the Depart-ment’s guidance on call routing of the sched-uling of appointments. Advanced practice registered nurses. —As stated in the House report, the Secretary is urged to work with facilities that have not yet implemented VA’s final rule granting full practice authority to advanced practice registered nurses to ensure quick implemen-tation. Physician assistants.—As stated in the Sen-ate report, VA is directed to accelerate the rollout of competitive pay for physician as-sistants and develop a plan on how to better utilize the Health Professional Scholarship Program and Education Debt Reduction Pro-gram. Proposed prosthetics services regulation. —The conferees support a veteran’s right to obtain prosthetic and rehabilitative items as med-ical services from the best possible source and look forward to a rule that will not limit a veteran’s choice. Historically Black Colleges and Universities medical research programs.—As indicated in the House report, VA is directed to take con-crete steps to improve its ongoing commit-ment to, and partnership with, minority health professions schools. Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI) affiliations with VA healthcare facilities.—As noted in the House report, the Secretary is urged to de-velop a plan to expand local VA medical fa-cilities’ participation with HSI medical schools. The conferees direct the Department to provide a report on its efforts not later than 30 days after enactment of this Act. National Veterans Sports Program.—The con- ference agreement provides $23,825,000 for the National Veterans Sports Program, with $2,000,000 designated for veterans monthly assistance allowances; $15,000,000 for the Adaptive Sports Grants Program (ASGP); and $6,825,000 for the support of national vet-erans sports and special events programs like the Paralympics. The funding for the ASGP is an increase of $6,000,000 over the fis-cal year 2018 level and $7,000,000 over the re-quest. Given the promising results reported using equine therapy for veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder, $1,500,000 within the ASGP total is provided for equine therapy, an increase of $500,000 over the fis-cal year 2018 level. As stated in Senate Re-port 115–269 the conferees request that the Department provide a feasibility assessment for the cost of expanding the grant program to include recreational and lifelong sports, such as open ocean swimming, surfing, out-rigger canoeing, hunting, and fishing, as well as any legal barriers to expansion. Burn pits.—The conference agreement pro-vides $5,000,000 for Veterans Health Adminis-tration clinical proposals, developed in con-junction with research, focusing on post-de-ployment health for veterans exposed to air-borne hazards and open burn pits. In addi-tion, the Secretary is directed to provide an assessment of the process for informing vet-erans through VA and community care pro-viders about the Airborne Hazards and Open Burn Pit Registry and their eligibility for registering. Burn Pits Center of Excellence.—The con- ferees are aware that VA currently runs an Airborne Hazards Center of Excellence (AHCE) at the War Related Illness and In-jury Study Center. The AHCE was estab-lished in 2013 to provide an objective and comprehensive assessment of veterans’ cardiopulmonary function, military and non- military exposures, and health-related symp-toms for those with airborne hazard con-cerns. In addition, the AHCE conducts clin-ical and translational research and actively develops and delivers new educational con-tent to healthcare providers, veterans and other stakeholders. In order to better pre-vent, diagnose, mitigate, and treat condi-tions related to exposure to burn pits, as well as to leverage expertise in airborne haz-ards, the conferees have provided an addi-tional $5,000,000 for the Center to develop a concentration in burn pit study and re-search. Furthermore, to fully recognize the importance of this new mission and incor-porate the expansion into the Center’s over-arching expertise in Airborne Hazards, the Department is directed to rename the Center to the Airborne Hazards and Burn Pits Cen-ter of Excellence. To the maximum extent practicable, the Department should collabo-rate with the Department of Defense, insti-tutions of higher education, and other appro-priate public and private entities (including international entities) to carry out respon-sibilities and activities of this Center of Ex-cellence. Additionally, the conferees direct the Department to report back to the Com-mittees on Appropriations no later than 120 days after enactment of this Act progress made in establishing this enhanced center of excellence. Headache Centers of Excellence.—In fiscal year 2018, VA was provided $10,000,000 in Pub-lic Law 115–141, the Consolidated Appropria-tions Act of 2018, for the establishment of Headache Centers of Excellence. The con-ferees direct the Department to provide an update on the status of these Centers to the Committees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress no later than 30 days after enactment of this Act. 
MEDICAL COMMUNITY CARE  The conference agreement provides $10,758,399,000 in advance fiscal year 2020 funding for Medical Community Care, with $2,000,000,000 available until September 30, 2021. The conference agreement provides an ad-ditional $1,000,000,000 above the fiscal year 2019 advance appropriation for the Medical Community Care account. This level is $500,000,000 more than was requested by the Administration and these funds are available for unanticipated costs in VA’s traditional community care programs, as well as for re-quirements resulting from the passage of the MISSION Act. As a result of the MISSION Act, the conferees note that as early as May 2019 the Choice program, currently funded with direct spending, will be streamlined and consolidated with VA’s traditional discre-tionary community care programs. Although the administration indicated a significant portion of the costs were assumed in the President’s Budget request, it has not pro-vided a funding estimate for the consolidated program. Ultimately, the timing of consoli-dation and any change in cost is dependent on the issuance of regulations that will out-line the new program structure. As a result, the conferees direct the Department to pro-vide monthly reports to the Committees identifying obligations for the Medical Com-munity Care program against available ap-propriations, as well as anticipated funding needs based on the developing program structure. MEDICAL SUPPORT AND COMPLIANCE  The conference agreement provides $7,239,156,000 in advance for fiscal year 2020 for Medical Support and Compliance and makes $100,000,000 of the advance funding available through fiscal year 2021. The bill also includes Sec. 236, which rescinds $211,000,000 of fiscal year 2019 funds pre-viously appropriated for this account. 
MEDICAL FACILITIES  The conference agreement provides $6,141,880,000 in advance for fiscal year 2020 for Medical Facilities, as well as $90,180,000 in fiscal year 2019 funding, which is in addi-tion to the advance funding provided last year. Of the advance funding, $250,000,000 is made available through fiscal year 2021. Facility expansion.—Given the current co- location of VA clinics on some military in-stallations, such as at Tripler Army Medical Center in Hawaii and Joint Base Elmendorf in Alaska, and the likely benefits to VA of expanding this model to other military in-stallations, VA is directed, as described in the House report, to complete a study on the potential benefits of placing VA clinics on military installations located in areas with high veteran populations and where nearby VA infrastructure is overburdened. 
MEDICAL AND PROSTHETIC RESEARCH  The conference agreement provides $779,000,000 for Medical and Prosthetic Re-search, available until September 30, 2020 and includes a proviso making $27,000,000 of these funds available through fiscal year 2023. Bill language is included to ensure that the Secretary allocates adequate funding for prosthetic research specifically for female veterans and for toxic exposures. VA/Department of Energy computing collabo-ration.—Of the amount provided for Medical and Prosthetics Research, $27,000,000 is for VA’s collaboration with the Department of Energy (DOE) via a long-term inter-agency agreement to leverage DOE’s next genera-tion artificial intelligence, big data, and high-performance computing technologies, as well as multi-modal diagnostics and data integration, in order to develop specific pre-cision medicine applications. VA cancer moonshot contribution. —As indi- cated in the Senate report, the Department is directed to include skin cancer as a sub-ject of its efforts to provide targeted cancer

treatments to veterans through genomic science. Center of Excellence for Research on Return-ing War Veterans.—The House report directed VA to provide a report based on initial con-cerns regarding the potential impact that moving the Posttraumatic-stress Residential Rehabilitation Program might have on the Waco Center of Excellence for Research on Returning War Veterans. Those concerns have been adequately addressed by informa-tion provided subsequently in an inde-pendent assessment, and a report from VA on this issue is no longer required. Public-private partnerships.—The conferees urge VA to expedite consideration of pro-posals for public-private partnerships to le-verage co-location of VA and university bio-medical scientists engaged in multidisci-plinary research. 
NATIONAL CEMETERY ADMINISTRATION  The conference agreement provides $315,836,000 for the National Cemetery Ad-ministration (NCA). Of the amount provided, not to exceed 10 percent is available until September 30, 2020. 
DEPARTMENTAL ADMINISTRATION  
GENERAL ADMINISTRATION  
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)  The conference agreement provides $355,897,000 for General Administration. Of the amount provided, not to exceed 10 per-cent is available for obligation until Sep-tember 30, 2020. The conference agreement continues to include bill language permit-ting the transfer of funds from this account to General Operating Expenses, Veterans Benefits Administration. The conference agreement provides fund-ing for General Administration in the amounts specified below: 
Office (in thousands of dollars) 
Office of the Secretary ..................................................... 15,079 Office of General Counsel ................................................ 99,675 Office of Management ..................................................... 63,402 Office of Human Resources ............................................. 62,172 Office of Enterprise Integration ....................................... 27,967 Office of Ops, Security and Preparedness ...................... 22,547 Office of Public and Intergovernmental Affairs .............. 12,663 Office of Congressional and Legislative Affairs ............. 5,900 Office of Acquisition Logistics and Construction ........... 46,492 
The Secretary may alter these allocations if the Committees have been notified and written approval is provided. Additional budgetary information. —As de- scribed in the House report, VA is directed to include in its budget justification materials a table for each account that shows a five- year funding history, for requested and en-acted levels. Financial management system.—The con- ference agreement includes $10,800,000 in this account, in addition to amounts provided in the Information Technology Systems ac-count, for the development of a new financial management system. While the conferees do not question the need for a new financial management system, VA’s record of previous failures in developing such a system support the need for rigorous oversight of this pro-gram. As part of this oversight, VA is di-rected to provide quarterly reports that in-clude obligations, broken down by appro-priated, franchise, and other accounts. These reports should also include the development of an integrated master schedule and dash-board, life cycle costs, staffing, and schedule. In addition, VA is directed to conduct end- user surveys in a timeframe and with a con-tent identified by the conferees. Contractor accountability.—For contracts over $500,000,000 whenever the Secretary pro-vides a Show Cause Notice to a contracted service provider that establishes that the contractor did not cure the conditions en-dangering performance under the subject contract within the time frame prescribed in the Cure Notice, which necessitates a termi-nation for default, VA must submit to the Committees on Appropriations and the Com-mittees on Veterans’ Affairs of the Senate and the House of Representatives notifica-tion of issuance of each Show Cause Notice. At a minimum, the notification should in-clude: (1) an explanation of the reasons for providing such notice; (2) a description of the effect of the contractor failure, including with respect to cost, schedule, and require-ments; (3) a description of the actions taken by the Secretary to mitigate such failure (other than issuance of the cure notice); and, (4) a description of the actions taken by the contractor to address such failure. Prompt payments.—The conferees are con-cerned that VA is not paying small busi-nesses in a timely manner. Small business vendors depend on timely payments to pay for their services, pay their employees, and conduct business that they have agreed to perform for VA. Therefore, the conferees urge the Department to ensure that pay-ments are made to small businesses prompt-ly. Medical Care Collections Fund.—The con- ferees are aware that the Department con-tinues to struggle with collections of third- party billings, which has impacted revenue in the Medical Care Collections Fund. The Department has indicated that it will take action by the end of fiscal year 2018 to ad-dress this long-standing problem. The con-ferees direct VA to report to the Committees on Appropriations of both Houses of Con-gress no later than 60 days after enactment of this Act on how the Department is com-plying with directives regarding third-party billing contained in Public Laws 114–113 and 115–141. Debts incurred by individuals.—The Depart-ment is directed, within 180 days of enact-ment of this Act, to develop a means to track and monitor information on the age and amount of debts owed by individuals to the United States as a result of those indi-viduals’ participation in a VA-administered benefits program; whether such debts are the result of delays in VA processing of changes to beneficiary status or other VA actions; and whether such debts are disputed by those individuals. Further, VA is directed to sub-mit a report describing the plan no later than 90 days after it is developed. Inconsistencies in contracting policy after the Kingdomware decision.—In Public Law 115–96 VA was urged to issue additional guidance to provide a standard set of criteria for con-tracting officers to evaluate veteran-owned providers’ capabilities and to take steps to ensure their implementation consistently across the VISNs, in alignment with the GAO’s recommendations, especially about option years. The conferees have learned that VA has still not issued guidance and again urge VA to provide additional guid-ance. BOARD OF VETERANS APPEALS  The conference agreement provides $174,748,000 for the Board of Veterans Ap-peals, of which not to exceed 10 percent shall remain available until September 30, 2020. Appeals reform.—As VA has made progress in reducing the backlog of initial disability claims, there has been an increase in the number of appeals. Reforming the appeals process is critical in addressing this increase and requires the commitment of sufficient resources. As such, the Board of Veterans Appeals is urged, as described in the House report, to commit the necessary resources to reduce the backlog of appeals. 
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS  
(INCLUDING TRANSFER OF FUNDS)  The conference agreement provides $4,103,000,000 for Information Technology (IT) Systems. The conference agreement identi-fies separately in bill language the funding available for pay and associated costs ($1,199,220,000); operations and maintenance ($2,523,209,000); and systems development ($380,571,000). The conference agreement makes not to exceed 3 percent of pay and as-sociated costs funding available until the end of fiscal year 2020; not to exceed 5 per-cent of operations and maintenance funding available until the end of fiscal year 2020; and all IT systems development funding available until the end of fiscal year 2020. The conference agreement includes $32,013,000 in information technology funding for the Veterans Benefits Management Sys-tem that processes disability claims; $9,505,000 for the Board of Veterans Appeals claims appeals modernization effort; $72,821,000 for development of a new VA fi-nancial management system; and $22,081,000 for replacement of the NCA burial operations support system. The conference agreement continues lan-guage permitting funding to be transferred among the three IT subaccounts, subject to approval from the Committees. The conference agreement continues lan-guage providing that funding may be trans-ferred among development projects or to new projects subject to the Committees’ ap-proval. The conference agreement continues lan-guage indicating that no development project may be increased or decreased by more than $1,000,000 prior to receiving ap-proval of the Committees or a period of 30 days has elapsed. The conference agreement provides fund-ing for IT development for the projects and in the amounts specified in the following table:

This table is intended to serve as the De-partment’s approved list of development projects; any requested changes are subject to reprogramming requirements. Cybersecurity implementation.—As stated in the House report, VA is urged to ensure that patient records being transferred from DOD to VA have the same level of security and data-level protections as provided by the De-partment of Defense. Appointment scheduling.—The conferees un-derstand that the new electronic health record (EHR) contract includes an appoint-ment scheduling system component that will be rolled out across the VA network in con-junction with the EHR system over a ten- year time period. While supportive of the im-plementation of a single EHR that includes all elements, including appointment sched-uling, the conferees are disturbed that some regions of the country will not benefit from the scheduling system for a decade. An im-proved scheduling system must be one of VA’s top priorities to address the continuing problem of delayed appointments. The con-ferees urge VA to consider alternatives that would permit all regions of the country to receive the benefits of a modern scheduling system in advance of the nationwide EHR system roll-out. The conferees understand that VA may consider decoupling the sched-uling system from the rest of the EHR imple-mentation, permitting its nationwide imple-mentation far sooner. If that alternative is not adopted, VA is encouraged to consider implementing the commercial off-the-shelf scheduling solutions it is currently piloting. If evaluations of these pilots indicate that they provide significant interim or long- term benefits, the conferees urge their ex-pansion to additional geographic areas. The conferees direct VA to report within 90 days of enactment of this Act whether it has de-cided to separate the scheduling component within the EHR contract and implement it separately on a faster track. If the Depart-ment declines to take this action, the con-ferees direct the agency to notify the Com-mittees within 150 days of enactment of this Act of its alternative plans to accelerate na-tionwide implementation of an improved scheduling system. 
VETERANS ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD  The conference agreement provides $1,107,000,000 for activities related to the de-velopment and rollout of a new VA EHR, the associated contractual costs, and the sala-ries and expenses of employees hired under titles 5 and 38, United States Code. The fund-ing amount is $100,000,000 below the request based on the Department’s assertion that it could accommodate such a decrement with no adverse impact to program cost, schedule, or performance. Also, because this is a very substantial new effort and the timing of obli-gation of funding is uncertain, the con-ference agreement makes these funds avail-able for three years. Of the amount provided, not less than $412,000,000 is for improvement or establishment of infrastructure associated with the program. Additionally, the con-ference agreement includes bill language re-quiring the approval of the Committees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress before any funds may be used to deviate from the deployment schedules provided to those committees by VA. Given the potential resistance from some users in adopting a new electronic health record system, the conferees direct VA to focus sufficient resources and attention on the challenge of change management during deployment. The conferees further direct VA to: maintain clear and agreed-upon metrics and goals with the DOD in regard to elec-tronic health record interoperability and es-tablish clear timeframes for meeting those goals; update the VA/DOD Interagency Pro-gram Office guidance to reflect agreed-upon metrics and goals; and ensure clinician feed-back is sought and considered as the EHR system is modernized. Quarterly reporting.—The conferees con-tinue to direct GAO to perform quarterly performance reviews of the VA electronic health record deployment to keep the Com-mittees on Appropriations of both Houses of Congress apprised of VA’s progress. The con-ferees also continue to include bill language directing VA to provide quarterly updates on the status of the electronic health record program. VA is directed to provide obliga-tions, expenditures, and deployment imple-mentation by facility. The conferees also continue to include bill language directing that these funds are available only to the Of-fice of the Deputy Secretary. 
OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL  The conference agreement provides $192,000,000 for the Office of Inspector Gen-eral. Of the amount provided, not to exceed 10 percent is available for obligation until September 30, 2020. Community Living Centers (CLC).—The con- ferees direct the VA Office of Inspector Gen-eral to conduct an inspection of VA CLCs and report on best practices from VA and/or private sector that would improve the per-formance of VA CLCs that perform poorly on VA’s ranking system. Washington DC Veterans Affairs Medical Center.—The conferees urge the Inspector General to dedicate all necessary resources to provide rigorous oversight of the Wash-ington, DC, Veterans Affairs Medical Center,

SALARIES AND EXPENSES  The conference agreement includes $80,800,000 for Cemeterial Expenses, Army— Salaries and Expenses. Within that amount, up to $15,000,000 in funding is available until September 30, 2021. 
CONSTRUCTION  The conference agreement provides $33,600,000 for planning and design and con-struction of Southern Expansion to remain available until expended. Arlington National Cemetery Southern Expan-sion.—The conference agreement provides $33,600,000 for all activities, including con-struction of the Southern Expansion. The conferees note that the project is expected to cost upwards of $350,000,000 has an estimated completion date of 2025, adds 37 acres of land, and will extend the cemetery’s life into the 2050s. While the conferees strongly support extending the life of the cemetery, there are concerns that the proposed expansion lacks proper planning. For example the Commit-tees were initially told that the Southern Expansion would cost $274,000,000 however, now it appears that estimate was vastly un-derestimated. Therefore, no later than 180 days after enactment of this Act the con-ferees direct the Army to provide a com-prehensive plan that includes cost estimate and construction schedule. Furthermore, after this reporting requirement is met the Army shall provide quarterly updates until this project is completed. A

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H8089 September 10, 2018 
Trust Fund Solvency.—There continues to be a belief that both legislative and adminis-trative actions are necessary to improve Trust Fund solvency, eliminate AFRH’s reli-ance on the General Fund, and maintain the high-quality services provided to AFRH resi-dents.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF THE HONORABLE LAWRENCE D
ENARDIS, PH.D. 
HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO 
OF CONNECTICUT  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 10, 2018 Ms. D
ELAURO. Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise today to pay tribute to the life of an outstanding member of our com-munity, and my good friend, the Honorable Lawrence DeNardis, who passed away earlier this week. Larry was an extraordinary human being whose good work touched countless lives in many ways. He will be deeply missed by all of those fortunate enough to have known him. Larry served in public life where he dem-onstrated a unique commitment to public serv-ice. He served five terms in the Connecticut State Senate as well as one term in this body as the United States Representative for Con-necticut’s Third Congressional District. After his term in Congress, Larry went on to serve as the Acting Assistant Secretary for Legisla-tion at the United States Department of Health and Human Services. He was also appointed by former President George W. Bush as a member of the Board of Regents of the Na-tional Library of Medicine—a position which he held for four years. Larry spent much of his life as an educator and administrator in higher education. Long before either of us were involved in politics, Larry served for sixteen years as the Asso-ciate Professor and Chairman of Political Science at Albertus Magnus College, where he hired me to teach a course on international politics. He was also Visiting Professor of Government at Connecticut College, Guest Scholar at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars of the Smithsonian Institu-tion, and seminar instructor at Yale University. At the close of his professional life, Larry served for over a decade as President of the University of New Haven and under his lead-ership and direction the University truly pros-pered. I have often spoke of our nation’s need for talented, creative educators, willing to help our young people learn and grow—Larry was just that kind of teacher. His good work and diligent efforts to provide a quality education touched the lives of thousands of young peo-ple—going a long way in providing them with a strong foundation on which to build their fu-tures. It is not often that you find an individual who so willingly dedicates himself to the betterment of his community. In addition to his profes-sional contributions, Larry has worked with nu-merous local business and service organiza-tions aimed at providing a better quality of life for the residents of the Greater New Haven area. We may have come from different political viewpoints, but I could always count on Larry to provide insight or guidance when I asked. I consider myself fortunate to have had the opportunity to work with him and to call him my friend. Larry was many things to many people, teacher, community leader, friend, and mentor, but first and foremost, he was a hus-band, father, and family man. My deepest sympathies go out to his wife, Mary Lou; his four children Larry, Jr., Gregory, Mark, and Lesley; family, friends, and colleagues as we remember Lawrence DeNardis and the inspir-ing legacy of service he left to us all.

HONORING JAMES NORLYN HOFF 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 10, 2018 Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mr. James Norlyn Hoff and remember his rich and full life. Mr. Hoff was born in Portland, Oregon and spent his early years in Tillamook and Grand Pass, Oregon. His family moved to Eureka, California when he was twelve years old. Mr. Hoff graduated from Eureka High School and then interned for California Assemblyman Frank Belloti in Sacramento, California. He fol-lowed this experience with a second political internship in Washington, D.C., where he worked for Congressman Don Clausen. Mr. Hoff graduated from Humboldt State University with a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science. He was the first Northern Californian to receive the Graduate Fellowship from the Rotary Foundation of Rotary International for the 1972–73 academic year. He was spon-sored by the Rotary Club of Eureka and spent the year studying political science at the Uni-versity of Grenoble in France. When he returned to Eureka, Mr. Hoff worked for Simpson Timber Company, where he ran their plywood plant. He eventually moved to Seattle, Washington to work in the company’s corporate office. After he spent several years working at the company’s cor-porate office in Seattle, Mr. Hoff left to work at his father’s radio station, KRED–AM, in Eure-ka. He also built and ran a radio station, KPDJ–FM, and became known as the local media giant. In 1989, Mr. Hoff started Hoff Outdoor Advertising, which he eventually sold to his mentee. Mr. Hoff met his wife Claire in Meg `eve, France when he went back to visit her par-ents. Two years later they met again when she was visiting the United States. They were married in Eureka in 1979 and had two beau-tiful children, Alexia and Henry. His son Henry currently serves in the active duty Army as-signed to the 3rd Brigade, 10th Mountain Divi-sion as a Staff Sergeant. Mr. Hoff enjoyed skeet shooting in his free time and won many father and son competitions. Mr. Speaker, James Norlyn Hoff is the hus-band, father, businessman and community member we should all strive to be. It is there-fore fitting and proper that we honor him here today. f 
IN RECOGNITION OF THE 75TH AN-NIVERSARY OF THE LUDLOW LIONS CLUB 
HON. RICHARD E. NEAL 
OF MASSACHUSETTS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 10, 2018 Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to recognize and congratulate the Ludlow Lions Club on the occasion of its 75th anniversary. As the world’s largest serv-ice club organization, Lions Club International is full of members who volunteer their time to humanitarian causes, fundraising projects, and service endeavors not only in their local com-munities but also around the globe. The Lud-low Lions Club, chartered in 1943, certainly embodies this commitment to helping those in need, wherever need exists. The Ludlow Lions Club is one of the busiest clubs in Massachusetts and currently has over 30 members who give their time freely to help others. Their leadership, dedication, and ex-emplary character is undoubtedly worthy of

recognition. Over the past 75 years, the Lud-low Lions have devoted themselves to a near countless number of diverse ventures and fundraisers, including annual food drives, col-lege fundraisers, diabetes awareness cam-paigns, environmental conservation activities, emergency sight and hearing projects, and various youth development programs like the Peace Poster Project to just name a few. It is evident that the Ludlow Lions Club has made numerous positive contributions to the commu-nity of which it takes pride in being an integral part. I am confident that they will continue to serve and represent western Massachusetts with honor and distinction for years to come. Mr. Speaker, over the course of its history the Ludlow Lions Club has truly embodied the motto ‘‘We Serve.’’ Its loyal members have routinely demonstrated an exceptional commit-ment to helping those less fortunate. That pas-sionate dedication is a hallmark of the agen-cy’s long and admirable tradition of service in western Massachusetts. On the occasion of the Ludlow Lions Club’s 75th anniversary, I wish the organization and its devoted mem-bers all the best and much continued pros-perity.

INTRODUCTION OF THE COM-BATING IMPLICIT BIAS IN EDU-CATION ACT 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 10, 2018 Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today, I intro-duce the Combating Implicit Bias in Education Act. My bill would create a $25 million grant program for schools to train teachers, prin-cipals and other personnel on implicit bias, in-cluding with respect to actual or perceived race, religion, sex (including sexual orientation and gender identity), disability, ethnicity and socioeconomic status. The Department of Education’s Civil Rights Data Collection for the 2015–2016 school year found that students of color, males and those with disabilities received far more severe and frequent punishment than white, female and non-disabled students. Despite the findings of this report, the Trump Administration and U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos are con-sidering eliminating the Obama Administra-tion’s guidance seeking to curb exclusionary discipline. Students experiencing implicit bias and even outright discrimination face far great-er expulsion and suspension rates, fueling the school-to-prison pipeline and widening the stu-dent achievement gap. The bill aims to reduce the effect of implicit bias on school discipline, academic achieve-ment and academic attainment through re-search-based training for education personnel. Providing teachers and school officials with training could help close the achievement gap and reduce suspensions and expulsions. Under my bill, the Institute of Education Sciences under the Department of Education is tasked with evaluating and reporting on the effectiveness of the training. I strongly urge my colleagues to support this legislation. f

The first woman to be elected Governor of Connecticut, and the first woman in the nation to be elected without having been the spouse or widow of a former governor, Ella Grasso was a trailblazer for women in the world of politics. Each year, the Connecticut Demo-cratic Party honors a woman serving in public life whose contributions to our state reflect Ella Grasso’s leadership and vision. I can think of no one who has shown more dedication and commitment to making our state a better place for all of our residents than our own Nancy Wyman. Nancy was an x-ray technician and mother of two when she first ran for public office seeking a seat on the Tolland Board of Edu-cation. She was successful in her pursuit and thus began a career in public service that has spanned more than three decades. Following her eight-year tenure as a member of the Board of Education, Nancy went on to run and serve in Connecticut’s State House of Rep-resentatives for four terms before seeking statewide office in 1994. Nancy was the first woman to be elected Comptroller, a position which she held for sixteen years and only left when she was asked by now-Governor Dannel Malloy to be his Lieutenant Governor. As Lieu-tenant Governor, Nancy has chaired the Board of Access Health CT, Connecticut’s official health insurance marketplace. Created in 2011 to comply with the federal Affordable Care Act, her leadership has helped Access Health CT to become nationally recognized as one of the best health exchanges in the country and a model on which other states have developed their exchanges. Whether on the Board of Education, in the State House, as Comptroller, or Lieutenant Governor, Nancy has served our state and its residents with honor and distinc-tion, earning her the respect and admiration of all of those who worked with her no matter their political persuasion. Nancy is one of Connecticut’s most beloved politicians. With her witty sense of humor, her straight-shooting honesty, and the sky-high heels she is known for wearing for everything from press conferences to parades, Nancy connects with people from every walk of life. You know she is in your corner every time. I, like so many others, consider myself fortunate to call her my friend and I would be remiss if I did not take this opportunity to thank her for the countless times she has been there for me. She is my soul-sister—a kindred spirit whom I have been proud to work with and I cannot thank her enough for her friendship, support, and good work on our behalf. Nancy Wyman, in so many ways, is a re-flection of the very spirit in which the Ella Grasso Award is given, and I am honored to have this opportunity to join all of those gath-ered to recognize her and her legacy of serv-ice to Connecticut. I wish Nancy, her husband Michael, their two daughters and their hus-bands, Stacey and Steve Papa and Meryl and Bill Baldwin, and her grandchildren Kyle, Tay-lor, Lindsey, Max and Sydney, all the best for many more years of health and happiness.
