PRAYER The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-fered the following prayer: Let us pray. Precious Lord, always faithful and always true, use our lawmakers today as ambassadors of reconciliation and renewal. Open their minds to the coun-sels of Your eternal wisdom as You fill them with Your peace. Lord, increase their hunger and thirst for right living and lead them nearer to You. As they seek to be agents of Your peace, help them to honor You both in spirit and deeds. Inspire them to reach decisions based on truth, wisdom, compassion, and fairness for all. Watch over, O God, and care for the men and women in our military, sur-rounding them with the shield of Your protection and favor. We pray in Your mighty Name. Amen.

ZIKA VIRUS Mr. REID. Madam President, I was encouraged this morning to hear that President Obama is aggressively re-sponding to the Zika virus. Anyone who has heard the news about this ter-rible mosquito bite over the last sev-eral weeks has heard about the spread of Zika. This virus is primarily spread by mosquitoes in Central America, South America, the Caribbean, and the Pacific islands. Zika has been linked to birth defects in children, as well as other health problems. To date, there have been no confirmed cases of Americans getting Zika from mosquitoes in the conti-nental United States, but we must not lower our guard. Instead, we must take action. The President has taken action, and I appreciate that very much. That is why last week the entire Senate Demo-cratic caucus sent a letter to President Obama urging quick action responding to the Zika virus. To his credit, that is exactly what President Obama has done. Today the President announced that he is asking Congress for $1.8 bil-lion to combat the outbreak. This funding will, among other things, fur-ther research of the virus and a poten-tial vaccine; improve mosquito control methods here at home; create rapid-re-sponse teams in the United States; en-hance treatment for those who are in-fected; help deploy prevention and edu-cation strategies to key populations, including pregnant women and their partners; support international aid ac-tivities in affected areas; and train health care workers in affected coun-tries. It is critical that we approve the funds now, immediately, and give our government the resources it needs to fight the virus. We also need to make sure our Nation’s response to the virus includes increasing access to contra-ceptives for women in Zika-affected re-gions—for those who choose to use them. We in the Congress must follow President Obama’s direction and ag-gressively combat Zika. So I call on my colleagues to support this impor-tant funding. I have been called to the White House tomorrow afternoon at the same time the Republican leader has called a briefing on the Zika virus. I am going to send staff to that meeting. I can’t be at the White House and that briefing at the same time, but I will get a thor-ough, detailed account of what takes place at that briefing. I appreciate Sen-ator MCCONNELL arranging that meet-ing, and I apologize for not being able to be there.

AFFORDABLE CARE ACT Mr. REID. Madam President, last week marked the end of an open enroll-ment for the health exchanges created by the Affordable Care Act. The num-bers are in, and once again millions of Americans signed up for quality health care. Normally—it is normal now, and each year it keeps going up—nationally almost 13 million Americans selected their plans through health insurance marketplaces. In Nevada, almost 90,000 people enrolled in Nevada’s health ex-change. That represents a 20-percent increase over 2015 enrollment numbers. These numbers are further evidence that the Affordable Care Act— ObamaCare—is working. The law is helping Americans get access to qual-ity health care, many for the first time in their entire lives. That is why it is particularly frustrating to watch Re-publicans continue banging their heads when it comes to ObamaCare. Last Tuesday—Groundhog Day, fittingly— House Republicans voted for the 63rd time to repeal or undermine the Af-fordable Care Act. That is 63 times House Republicans have ignored all the evidence that proves the Affordable Care Act is helping their constituents. It is not just House Republicans; it seems as if every day my friend the Re-publican leader comes to the floor and rails against ObamaCare. He has led Senate Republicans in voting to repeal or defund the Affordable Care Act 17 different times. Yet more than 10 per-cent of the Republican leader’s own constituents are benefiting from the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES694 February 8, 2016 
Affordable Care Act. Madam President, 500,000 Kentucky residents use ObamaCare—half a million people. Last week an Associated Press arti-cle highlighted the fact that Kentucky has seen the largest drop in the per-centage of its uninsured. I will read from an AP story: 
Kentucky and Arkansas had the largest drops in the percentage of people without health insurance in the country, according to the Gallup-Healthways survey. In 2013, more than 20 percent of Kentuckians did not have health insurance. By the end of 2015, after the State expanded its Medicaid pro-gram and created a health-insurance ex-change, that figure was down to 7.5 percent. 
There it is in black and white. In 2013, 20 percent of Kentuckians didn’t have health insurance, and now it is down to 7.5 percent. That is a remark-ably strong decrease of the uninsured. If my friend the Republican leader had his way and repealed ObamaCare, all progress in Kentucky would be gone. Sadly, Kentucky’s tea party Gov-ernor is following in Senator M
CCON-
NELL ’s footsteps. Gov. Matt Bevin wants to tear apart his State’s health exchange, regardless of the impact on his constituents. I will read again from the AP article: 
Bevin, a Republican, has already given the order to dismantle Kynect, Kentucky’s state-based exchange. And he plans to repeal Kentucky’s Medicaid expansion and replace it with something else that [would] mean fewer people would be eligible and the ones who stay eligible would have to pay a small premium. Bevin needs approval from the fed-eral government to do that. If he does not get it, Bevin has said he would repeal the ex-pansion entirely. 
It is time for Republicans to accept the fact that ObamaCare is here to stay. It is not going anyplace. Once and for all, it has moved past repeal. Start making the Affordable Care Act work even better for the American people.

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-jority leader is recognized.

ZIKA VIRUS Mr. M
CCONNELL. Madam President, I recently asked Secretary Burwell to come to the Senate to brief committee chairs, ranking members, and leaders in both parties on the administration’s response to the Zika virus. I appreciate her team working with us to schedule that briefing for tomorrow. Here are the two areas in which we want to get a better understanding at the briefing: No. 1, what preparations are being made to protect Americans? No. 2, what are the administration’s funding priorities given limited Fed-eral resources? Concern about the Zika virus is growing in our country, and protecting constituents, especially children, from a communicable disease is a high pri-ority for all of us. I am looking forward to hearing more tomorrow about both the administration’s proposed response and its priorities for combatting this disease. f 
ENERGY POLICY MODERNIZATION BILL Mr. M
CCONNELL. Madam President, the legislation currently before us—the Energy Policy Modernization Act—is the product of a year’s worth of con-structive and collaborative work. In the Energy Committee, it passed over-whelmingly with the support of both parties. Here on the floor, it has been subject to an open amendment process, with input from both sides. More than 30 amendments from both Democrats and Republicans have already been adopted. The Senator from Alaska re-cently sought consent to continue that progress by getting several more amendments pending. It is unclear why any colleague would object to her ef-fort or why they would effectively block consideration of their own amendments, but that is what hap-pened. It is disappointing for our coun-try. We are hoping our friends will recon-sider. Remember, the Energy Policy Modernization Act is broad bipartisan legislation designed to help Americans produce more energy, pay less for en-ergy, and save energy, all while helping strengthen our long-term national se-curity. We should pass it. I am asking colleagues to take yes for an answer and allow the open amendment process to continue so that we can pass it, which is so important to helping our country prepare for the energy demands of today and the en-ergy opportunities of tomorrow.

HEEDING HURRICANE WARNINGS Mr. NELSON. Madam President, hur-ricanes can be deadly. We are accus-tomed to them in Florida. They are part of our lifestyle. We know enough about hurricanes and the ferociousness and strength of Mother Nature to know that when a hurricane starts bearing down, you better be prepared, and that is especially so with regard to boats. Hurricanes cause giant-sized waves and strong winds that make it impossible to navigate a boat. So when the fore-cast calls for a hurricane, boats ought to get out of the way. Sadly, last year the El Faro, a cargo vessel that sailed from Jacksonville to Puerto Rico and back, along with its sister ship, sailed right into a hurri-cane off the Bahamas. As a result, the last call to shore, although the cap-tain’s voice was calm, was to report that they had lost power and were therefore listing, which meant that something had been breached and water was coming into the ship. That was the last we heard from the captain. We now know that that ship is 5 miles below the surface of the Atlantic, on the eastern side of the Bahama Islands. Thirty-three people lost their lives, most of whom were from the Jackson-ville, FL, area. The National Transpor-tation Safety Board is conducting an investigation, and the question is whether or not they are going to put down another U.S. Navy submersible so they can continue their search for the recorder that would give them the complete data from the ship. I am bringing this up again because the very same thing almost happened yesterday, only this time a 4,000-pas-senger cruise ship, sailing from the New York area to Port Canaveral, FL, and then on to other destinations in the Caribbean, sailed right into a hur-ricane that had winds topping 100 miles per hour. I wish I had a blowup of the image of these hurricanes to show the Senate. Yesterday’s storm was right off the coast of North and South Carolina. When these two images are compared side by side, we can see how yester-day’s storm is similar to Hurricane Isa-bel. They look menacingly similar. The thing about yesterday’s storm is that it was forecasted for days. So why in the world would a cruise ship with thousands of passengers on it go sailing right into it? Some of the passengers have made comments, including Robert Huschka, executive editor of the Detroit Free Press, who was a passenger on the cruise. He said: ‘‘I am not going to lie. It was truly terrifying.’’ Passengers talked about how the water was coming into the upper decks. The pictures that were taken by the passengers on the ship speak for them-selves. I am sure there was a coura-geous crew on board, but the question is: Why, after what happened to the El Faro last year, did it sail into the storm? Even if they were surprised by the change of the direction of the storm, which is what happened with the hurricane last year, why in the world would a ship go anywhere close to where the hurricane could be, par-ticularly as the storm starts to cross the warm waters of the Gulf Stream,

and, therefore, gets all the more fuel for the counterclockwise rotation of the winds from the warm water? I want the National Transportation Safety Board, over which the Senate Commerce Committee has some juris-diction—of which I have the privilege of being the ranking member—to come up with a quick report. Now, thank goodness, that so far only four passengers were reported in-jured and no one was killed. That ship is now returning to port back in the New York area. Thank goodness there was not much damage, and that it is seaworthy. But the question is, When there is a storm brewing, why are mis-takes made just like what happened to the El Faro? Before it left the Port of Jacksonville, they knew that a hurri-cane was coming. We need to know what happened in this case as well so we can prevent these kinds of accidents that could be so tragic in the future. The Senate Commerce Committee has oversight of the National Transpor-tation Safety Board, and I want them to come up with answers very quickly and make an admonition to Americans that when a storm is brewing, you don’t go out of port. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. C

TRIBUTE TO RICHARD ANDERSON  
Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, on Fri-day of last week as I was getting ready to leave to go home to the State of Georgia, the United States of America, and the aviation industry received no-tice that Richard Anderson, CEO of Delta Airlines, will retire after a career of over 25 years in the aviation indus-try, but in particular a great career at Delta Airlines over the last decade. I rise to memorialize on the floor of the Senate how much my State and the aviation industry owes to Richard An-derson. Richard took over Delta at a very critical time. In fact, Delta was in des-perate straits. Because of his work at Delta, he revitalized the culture of the company, he revitalized the aviation industry in Georgia, and he made it a market for all of us to be proud of. In fact, in 1 year, 2 years ago, Delta was one of the 50 most admired companies in the United States of America and led the world in terms of aviation as stated by Aviation Magazine, but most importantly Richard Anderson came to Washington, DC, when all the aviation industry was in trouble. He was then with Northwest. Delta was having dif-ficulties. He worked with the U.S. Sen-ate, worked with the Finance Com-mittee, worked with me, MIKEENZI, and others to reform the pension per-formance act of 2005, and change the way pensions were calculated in order to save the pensions of Delta Airlines and many other airlines in the United States of America. His hands-on effort to revitalize that company led to the most prosperous year in its history in 2016, and the most prosperous decade it had in the last 10 years. So as he announces he is leaving Delta Airlines and the aviation indus-try for other things to do, I want to, on the floor of the Senate, commend him for all he has done to make Delta Air-lines in the State of Georgia great, all he has done for the aviation industry, and all he has done for the economy of the greatest country on the face of this Earth—the United States of America. I yield back the remainder of my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Iowa. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today the Senate will vote on the nom-ination of Judge Ebinger from Iowa. I am very pleased to be here to support her and to urge all my colleagues to also support her nomination. I am very proud of the work my col-league Senator E
RNST and I have done to fill the vacancies in Iowa’s district courts by putting forward two excep-tionally talented and qualified nomi-nees, Judges Ebinger and Strand. I said this in committee but, for the benefit of all Members of the Senate, the Iowa nominees are two of the best judicial candidates the President has nomi-nated during his Presidency. To fill the vacancies in Iowa, I set up a Judicial Selection Commission and invited all interested Iowa lawyers to apply. The applicants were vetted by highly qualified members of the Iowa legal community. After spending hun-dreds of hours reviewing the applica-tions, the Commission interviewed all 39 applicants. Eleven candidates of the thirty-nine were then selected for a lengthy second round of interviews. At the end of the process, the Commission sent their recommendations to me. In consultation with my fellow Iowa Sen-ator, I was proud to recommend Judges Strand and Ebinger to the White House. Judges Strand and Ebinger have the highest credentials and character and will serve the State of Iowa with honor and with distinction. I would like to say a little bit more about Judge Ebinger because she is the one of the two we are voting on today. Judge Ebinger received her under-graduate degree in 1997 from George-town University School of Foreign Service and her law degree from Yale Law School in 2004. She then served as a special assistant U.S. attorney in the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Iowa in Cedar Rapids. There, she prosecuted criminal cases involving narcotics, immigration, fire-arms offenses, and violent crimes. She then clerked for Judge Michael Melloy on the Eighth Circuit for 2 years, also in Cedar Rapids, IA. Following her clerkship, she moved to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Iowa as an assist-ant U.S. attorney. During this time, her practice shifted primarily to white- collar crime. She also handled intake for all child support enforcement cases and sex offender registry violations. Judge Ebinger received a number of awards for her work with the U.S. At-torney’s Office. In 2012, she was ap-pointed to serve as a district judge in Iowa State court and was retained as a district judge in the 2014 election. As a State court judge, she presided over a court of general jurisdiction, handling civil law and equity, criminal, and family court proceedings. She has pre-sided over 40 cases that have gone to verdict or trial. Judge Ebinger is a highly qualified, well-respected judge already, and I urge my colleagues to support her nomination today. Mr. President, I yield the floor. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today we will vote on the nomination of Rebecca Ebinger to fill a judicial vacancy in the Federal district court in the southern district of Iowa. Ms. Ebinger is a highly qualified nominee who has devoted her legal ca-reer to public service. Since 2012, she has served as a district judge in Iowa State court. Prior to joining the bench, Judge Ebinger served as a prosecutor at the Federal and State levels in Iowa, including in the U.S. attorney’s offices for the southern and northern districts of Iowa. During her tenure as a Federal prosecutor, she was the lead attorney on cases involving violence against women. Judge Ebinger has the strong support of her home State Senators, Chairman G
RASSLEY of the Judiciary Committee and Senator E
RNST .

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES696 February 8, 2016 
With her qualifications, I can under-stand why Chairman G
RASSLEY rec-ommended her to the President for this nomination. What I cannot understand is why moneyed Washington interest groups are calling on Republican Sen-ators to oppose the confirmation of any judicial nominee, regardless of a nomi-nee’s merit or qualifications. Judicial nominees like Judge Ebinger have worked hard to build admirable legal careers that have put them at the top of their profession. When judicial nominees submit themselves to the nominations process, they do so ex-pecting and deserving to be considered by Senators exercising their own inde-pendent judgement. Judicial nominees not only deserve our independent and considered judge-ment, it is our constitutional obliga-tion as Senators to provide it. The duty to provide advice and consent on the President’s nominees is our own and cannot be abdicated to Washington political action committees. This is es-pecially true when such political ac-tion committees are advocating that we turn our backs on the American people by completely shutting down the judicial confirmation process. Too many Americans who have sought justice in our Federal courts since last year have instead found delays and empty courtrooms because of Senate Republicans’ obstruction on judicial nominees. Over the course of last year, Senate Republicans allowed confirmation votes on just 11 judicial nominees—and judicial vacancies soared across the country. When Sen-ate Republicans took over the majority in January of last year, there were 43 judicial vacancies. Since then, vacan-cies have dramatically increased to 77—an increase of more than 75 per-cent. Furthermore, the number of judi-cial vacancies deemed to be ‘‘emer-gencies’’ by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts because caseloads in those courts are unmanageably high has nearly tripled under Republican Senate leadership—from 12 when Re-publicans took over last year to 32 today. Refusing to confirm any judicial nominees for the rest of this year would make the high number of vacan-cies in our Federal judiciary even worse. In addition to the vote on Judge Ebinger’s confirmation today, we have agreed to vote this week on another Iowa district court judge. When we re-turn from the Presidents’ Day recess, I hope Republicans will continue con-firming judicial nominees with bipar-tisan support, as Democrats did when we held the majority. In 2008, when I was chairman of the committee with a Republican President, we worked to confirm judicial nominees as late as September of the Presidential election year. In fact, Senate Democrats helped confirm all 10 of President Bush’s dis-trict court nominees pending on the Senate floor in a single day by unani-mous consent on September 26, 2008. This was similarly true in 2004, when I was ranking member of the committee with a Republican President, and we worked to confirm nominees as late as September of the Presidential election year. There are 19 judicial nominees await-ing confirmation on the Senate floor. The next judicial nominee pending after we return from the President’s Day recess will be Waverly Crenshaw, an exceptional African-American dis-trict court nominee from Tennessee who has the support of his Republican home State Senators, Senators A
LEX-
ANDER and C ORKER . I hope the Senators from Tennessee will be able to con-vince their majority leader to schedule the Tennessee nominee’s vote to occur this month. This is an emergency judi-cial vacancy in their State, so it is clear that this position is sorely needed for Tennesseans to receive swift justice in the middle district of Tennessee. I urge my fellow Senators to vote to confirm Judge Ebinger and look for-ward to working with my fellow Sen-ators to ensure timely confirmation of the other judicial nominees pending be-fore the Senate. Mr. GRASSLEY. I suggest the ab-sence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield back time.

CCONNELL. Mr. President, on behalf of the junior Senator from Texas, Mr. C
RUZ, I object. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-tion is heard. The Senator from Minnesota. Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, as I said, this has been a bipartisan effort to get these two nominees confirmed. There is no one holding up the vote on these nominations except for Senator C
RUZ. We asked him to remove these holds. He has not voiced any concerns about these individual nominees. He has voiced concerns about unrelated foreign policy issues. There have been other holds in the past, but everyone has lifted their hold. I note that even Senator C
OTTON from Arkansas has said that there are no issues with the qualifications of these nominees and that these nominees should proceed to a vote. As I said, this is the fifth time I have come to the floor. I have also been joined by Senator C
ARDIN , Senator S
HAHEEN , and Senator F RANKEN . This is something that has to get done. Listen to these numbers: Sam Heins has been waiting for 293 days to be con-firmed as the U.S. ambassador to Nor-way. Azita Raji has been waiting 474 days to be confirmed as the first female U.S. Ambassador to Sweden. Both of these nominees were voted out of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee without controversy and with signifi-cant bipartisan support. Not a single Senator has questioned the qualifica-tions of Sam Heins or Azita Raji. That is because they are both qualified to take these jobs. We have an ambassador in France. We have an ambassador in England. We have an ambassador in Italy. We have an ambassador in Germany. We have an ambassador to nearly every Euro-pean nation but not these two Scan-dinavian countries. More than 1,200 refugees seek asylum in Sweden every single day. I cannot tell my colleagues how many times I have heard people on both sides of the aisle talk about how during this ref-ugee crisis we need a strong and unified Europe, and we need to be their allies, and they need to be our allies. While we may have disagreements on how to solve all of the refugee crises, we have to at least give support to our allies who are taking in these refugees. Sweden accepts more refugees per capita than any other country in the European Union. Norway expects to take in as many as 25,000 refugees this year. It has already provided more than $6 million to Greece to help re-spond to the influx of refugees seeking a way to enter Europe. All of us on both sides of the aisle have talked about this. Yet, right now, no Ambas-sadors are in those two critical coun-tries. I would note they have Ambassadors from China in those countries. They have Ambassadors from Russia. They have Ambassadors. So the people of their countries who love the United States, who respect the United States, who travel to the United States, they want to know: How come every major nation has an ambassador to our coun-try but not the United States of Amer-ica? We also understand the important economic contributions Sweden and Norway make to our country. These diplomatic relations are 200 years old. That is why we have widespread sup-port for these nominees. Yet one Sen-ator—how can one Senator stand in the way of a vote affecting relations that are 200 years old? Our economic partnership with these countries is enormous. Sweden sup-ports over 330,700 American jobs across 50 States. In the case of Norway, our trade partnership is $16 billion—$7 bil-lion in exports, $9 billion in imports. Leaving these countries without a U.S. Ambassador is a slap in the face to their governments, their people, and all of the American workers who are supported by Swedish and Norwegian investment in the United States. That is happening today. In addition to Sam Heins and Azita Raji, there are other nominees who are vital in our fight against terrorism; however, I am going to focus today on these two nominees. We have two countries, Norway and Sweden, that are members of NATO, that have joined us in the fight against Islamic extremists, that have joined us in the fight against ISIS. This is no way to treat them. I would also add, in kind of a com-bination of our national security inter-ests and economic interests, that Nor-way has now signed to purchase 252 fighter planes—22 just recently—from Lockheed Martin. Those fighter planes are made in America. The country of Norway could have decided to buy those fighter planes from any nation in the world. They could have bought those fighter planes from Europe. Where did they buy those fighter planes from? They brought them from the United States, from Lockheed Mar-tin, and that company is located in Texas. Those fighter planes are made in Fort Worth, TX, Senator CRUZ’s home State. So what do we say to Norway when they invest? We can do the math— nearly $200 million a plane, 22 planes. So they have strong national security, as we see Russian aggression and Is-lamic extremism and as they join with us in fights across the world. What do we say? You are not worthy of an am-bassador. Because one Senator—the Senator from the State where those fighter planes are made, from Fort Worth, TX—has decided to hold this up. What are we doing when we say to a major company in the United States that got a major deal with a foreign government that that government is not worthy of having an ambassador? What kind of encouragement do we give when we don’t even let them have an ambassador? This is one of many examples of what is going on and why the people are so angry. We have heard from the Foreign Minister. We have seen comments from people of Norwegian descent and Swed-ish descent who do not understand how this could be going on right now, given everything Europe is confronting. It is my hope that we will be able to work these things out. We have been given various reasons from letters that have been written, to streets in front of embassies, for this hold. But we are hopeful that somehow we are going to be able to work this out. This is be-cause of one Senator who is not even here in this Chamber day after day after day when I return to put these names in for Ambassador. We are not stopping. Senator S
HA-

EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER THE LAW Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about a very important issue for our Nation’s judicial system and two bills that I and my colleague from Montana have introduced. The bills’ primary focus is what all of us in the Senate want, and that is equal jus-tice under the law.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES698 February 8, 2016 
One of the bills would split the dys-functional and unwieldy U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The other bill would form a commission to evaluate the court and make rec-ommendations based on its findings. Like a lot of us here, when I am in Washington I like to get out and try to get a run in in the morning and look at the beautiful monuments, memorials. Oftentimes I run past the U.S. Supreme Court, and I often look at the inscrip-tion etched on the beautiful Court there that says simply ‘‘Equal justice under law.’’ I think of Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell’s famous quote restated: 
Equal justice under the law is not merely a caption on the facade of the Supreme Court building, it is perhaps the most inspiring ideal of our society. It is one of the ends for which our entire legal system exists. . . . 
I also think of the thousands of law-yers and judges and clerks, past and present, who have lived their lives at-tempting to fulfill its important ideal and how our democratic system of gov-ernment is dependent on striving for this ideal. We should do everything in this body to make sure that simple concept— equal justice under the law—is a re-ality for all Americans. All Americans should feel assured that when we seek justice, the burdens we encounter, the time we encounter to achieve justice won’t be smaller or greater depending on the part of the country in which we live. Unfortunately, that is not the case. Unfortunately, if you are a citizen of the United States and you live in one of the States over which the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has ju-risdiction over your legal issues in the administration of justice, one in five Americans do not get equal justice under the law. What our bills are fo-cused on doing is righting that wrong because the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is simply too large, its scope is too wide, and it has long passed its ability to provide equal jus-tice and to contribute as a functional court system in the U.S. court of ap-peals Federal court system in our country. This is no surprise. We have known this for decades. Dividing the Ninth Circuit is not a new idea. In fact, not doing it is radical. If you look at the history of the United States, when Fed-eral courts of appeals have grown in terms of population, what has hap-pened every time for decades, for well over 100 years, is that when the court grows too big and the administration of justice grinds to a halt, the court is split so that you have that justice. That is the usual course of American history. What is not usual is the re-fusal to do this. To give a few examples, in 1973 a con-gressionally chartered Commission rec-ommended to this body that for the ad-ministration of justice for American citizens, the Ninth Circuit should be split. It actually recommended that the Fifth and Ninth Circuit should be split. The Fifth Circuit was eventually split, but according to the Commission, the Ninth Circuit, which it said had se-rious difficulties with backlog, delay, and justice for Americans, was not split, and it has only gotten worse. To give a few facts, there are 65 mil-lion people living within the bound-aries of the Ninth Circuit. That rep-resents 20 percent of the total popu-lation of the United States—one in five Americans. That is almost two times as many people as there are in the next biggest circuit in the U.S. court of ap-peals system, and it is almost three times the average population of all the other circuits combined. It is not only just the size of the court. The caseload is what is inhibiting justice for Americans in the Ninth Cir-cuit. At the end of a 12-month period last year, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals had almost 14,000 pending ap-peals; the next largest court of appeals had about 4,700. Justice delayed is jus-tice denied. In previous hearings in the Senate, we found that it takes, on average, for the Ninth Circuit, almost 40 percent longer to dispose of an appeal than in any other circuit in the country. This is simply a function of a court that is too big and too unwieldy. Because of the size and inefficiency of the court, the court has started to come up with creative shortcuts—questionable proce-dural shortcuts which I believe are shortchanging justice for tens of thou-sands of Americans every year in this court of appeals. Let me give you a few examples. Every court in the U.S. Federal sys-tem, in order to have uniformity of law, when they have difficult issues, they meet as a court in what they call an en banc meeting. This provides uni-formity in all the courts. There is only one court that doesn’t do that. Because it has 29 judges—much more than any other court—the Ninth Circuit does not meet as a whole court; therefore, lim-iting its ability to address intracircuit conflicts, with no uniformity in the law in the Ninth Circuit, and it is seen again and again and again. Further, and perhaps most alarming—again be-cause of its size—the Ninth Circuit is the only court of Federal appeals where a nonelected, nonappointed, nonarticle II judge called an appellate commis-sioner rules on matters by the thou-sands that should be handled by article III life-tenured judges—not an appel-late commissioner who is none of those things. In a 2005 congressional hearing, one of the Ninth Circuit judges testified ‘‘that the appellate commissioner re-solved 4,600 motions that would other-wise have been heard by judges.’’ This is fast-food justice for one in five Americans who are part of the Ninth Circuit. This Senator plans to come down to the floor over the next several weeks and speak to my experience on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. I had the opportunity—the honor—to be a ju-dicial law clerk for one of the most es-teemed judges, Judge Kleinfeld of Fair-banks, AK, many years ago, but I did see firsthand how the unwieldy size of this court of appeals limits justice, not just for Alaskans but for any citizen who is under the jurisdiction of this court. Chief Justice Warren Burger warned in 1970 that ‘‘a sense of confidence in the courts is essential to maintain the fabric of ordered liberty for a free peo-ple.’’ He cautioned that inefficiency and delay in our courts of appeals could destroy that confidence. Unfortu-nately, as it is currently constituted, the Ninth Circuit is inefficient, it delays, and therefore denies justice for millions of Americans, and we cannot allow the confidence in our system of justice to be undermined by continuing a court of appeals that is so large and so unwieldy. That is why the Senator from Montana and I intend with our bills to bring equal justice for all Americans. I turn to my colleague from Montana for his views on this very important issue. Mr. DAINES. I thank the junior Sen-ator from Alaska, and I appreciate him joining me in this most important ef-fort and also for the leadership he has demonstrated on this issue. As the jun-ior Senator from Alaska knows, the Ninth Circuit Court is broken. It is overburdened and is unable to provide quality service and expeditious justice for the Americans it is supposed to serve. When we offer the Pledge of Alle-giance, we close with ‘‘and justice for all.’’ As I frequently tell my staff, we in public service are ultimately in the customer service business. As U.S. Sen-ators, our No. 1 job is to represent and to serve the people in our States. Our courts should reflect the same serving mentality as they uphold their respon-sibility to justice, but when our courts are overburdened and overworked, it is the American people who are left un-derserved and waiting far too long for justice. Unfortunately, under the cur-rent structure, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals is unable to provide Ameri-cans in the West the service they de-serve. Take a look at this chart behind me. At 64.4 million people served, the cur-rent Ninth Circuit is the largest circuit by population as well as the largest land area. As the junior Senator from Alaska will sometimes remind us, if they divide Alaska in two, Texas is the third largest State in the Nation. It is not just about the geographical size of the West. Look at the number of people who are served in the Ninth Circuit. It includes Montana, Alaska, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Nevada, Arizona, Cali-fornia, and Hawaii, not to mention sev-eral U.S. territories, Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands. That alone amounts to 20 percent of the Nation’s population. Let’s put this in context. That is 85 percent larger than the next largest

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S699 February 8, 2016 
circuit which serves just 34.8 million people, and this chart illustrates that well. Needless to say, the Ninth Cir-cuit’s caseload is significantly greater than any other circuit, and that means backlogs and that means delays. Not only is it larger, it is disproportion-ately larger. On average, the Ninth Cir-cuit has had more than 32 percent of all cases pending nationally. As the junior Senator from Alaska mentioned, it cur-rently has over 14,000 cases pending. As you can see in this next chart behind me, that is three times more than the next closest circuit, the Fifth Circuit, which has around 4,700 cases pending. Processing all these cases takes time; in fact, on the average, over the last 5 years, nearly 15 months from appeal to determination. It is time to take a serious look at how our court system can better serve the American people, and that is why Senator S
ULLIVAN and I have intro-duced two separate bills to address these challenges. Our bills would bring much needed reform, not just to the Ninth Circuit but also to the entire Federal circuit courts of appeals sys-tem. The Circuit Court of Appeals Re-structuring and Modernization Act would split the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals into two circuits, providing a more manageable balance of popu-lation and geography for both circuits so western Americans can be better served by our courts. The Federal Courts of Appeals Mod-ernization Act would establish a com-mission to study the Federal circuit courts of appeals system and identify changes needed to promote an expedi-tious and effective disposition of the Ninth Circuit caseload. Keep this in mind. When we split the circuits into a new Ninth and the Twelfth Circuits, the Ninth Circuit would still have a larger caseload than any other circuit. In the new Ninth Circuit’s jurisdiction, there would be 40.8 million people. It would continue to maintain its status as first in population. In the Twelfth Circuit’s jurisdiction, this new circuit we would establish, there would be 24.3 million people, which makes it the sev-enth largest in population among the circuits. It is just a little bit below the average. Those numbers alone should make it clear reforms are needed. It is worth remembering that the challenges facing the Ninth Circuit have been longstanding, and the efforts to find solutions are bipartisan. In fact, two prior Commissions—one in 1973 and the other in 1988, which, by the way, was championed by California Senator D
IANNE FEINSTEIN —both determined that the Ninth Circuit had an overly burdensome size and scope and sug-gested that changes be made with the structure of the Federal courts of ap-peals. It is time to move forward with con-crete solutions to address this problem. The bills introduced by the junior Sen-ator from Alaska and I will do so. I was trained as an engineer. As an engineer, one identifies a problem and most importantly finds a solution. We have a capacity constraint which can be alleviated. In thinking about our communities, as our communities grow, we need to add more schools, add more teachers, and add more police of-ficers. We need to ensure that all Americans have access to the justice they deserve. It is time to split the Ninth Circuit. I want to thank the junior Senator from Alaska for championing this im-portant issue, and I look forward to working with him to find a resolution. Mr. SULLIVAN. I thank my col-league from Montana and for his point in particular. The charts make a very compelling case, but I think his point in particular about constraints—when things get too large, they become an organization that cannot function. I think when you look at the debate that has occurred previously about the Ninth Circuit, somehow we have gotten to the point where it is some kind of radical idea to split the Ninth Circuit. But if you look at the history of our country, the radical idea is actually not splitting the Ninth Circuit. The outlier position is not to take a court either that has this many cases pend-ing or that controls this much of the population and not do something about it. The history of this body, starting with the Judiciary Act of 1789 that cre-ated three circuit courts: Eastern, Mid-dle, and Southern—only a few years later, Congress acted again—in 1802, a mere 13 years later—and Congress dou-bled the number of circuit courts to six. What we have seen throughout our history is when this kind of situation exists where one court has an enor-mously oversized population, Con-gress—as my colleague from Montana mentioned—acts in a bipartisan man-ner, and they act for the sole reason to make sure all Americans are getting effective administration of justice. When your citizens wait longer than any other Americans and have delays more than any other Americans and when your court that you are subject to the jurisdiction of starts to create procedural shortcuts, not a lot of which are known—and we are going to talk about some of those over the next several weeks—and no other court does that, you start to see that one in five Americans is burdened by this and bur-dened by the lack of what the Supreme Court says: ‘‘Equal Justice Under Law.’’ I again thank my colleague from Montana. I know he has some views on what would happen again if this doesn’t happen in his State or in my State. But this isn’t just about the West; this is about all Americans. We all deserve the same justice. Just by looking at these two posters, cases pending, as I talked about ear-lier, and the time it takes to get ap-peals completed and the enormous pop-ulation of just one circuit, what is clear to me is that the Congress needs to act. I am honored to be working with my good friend from Montana where we are offering Congress a variety of different ways to approach this—a commission, a bill to split the circuit. But I want to emphasize that this is not a radical idea; the radical idea that is out of step with American history is to not do something about this. Every time in America’s history since the Judiciary Act of 1789 when this type of situation has occurred, Congress has acted, and they acted be-cause they knew equal justice under the law was at stake. Mr. DAINES. I remember as we were raising our four children, sometimes it would be late at night with a sick child, and I would turn on ‘‘Sesame Street’’ with the child. I remember there was that ‘‘One of These Things (Is Not Like the Others)’’ song. As I look at that chart, this could be a ‘‘Sesame Street’’ illustration. One of these circuits is not like the others. It is such a stark contrast to what we see with the Ninth Circuit. With the disproportionate number of cases that are pending in the Ninth Circuit, this is not that complicated of a problem in terms of trying to iden-tify where the problem lies. It is sim-ply a factor of constraints, and it starts with the population chart my colleague from Alaska has, but then it results in a disproportionate share of cases coming out of that population. That is why something must be done. These two prior Commissions that have studied this before, the one in 1973—which, by the way, in 1973, I was 11 years old. I was about ‘‘Sesame Street’’ age then. At that point they said the Ninth Circuit had an overly burdensome size in 1973. Yet again in 1998, I am grateful that California Sen-ator DIANNE FEINSTEIN was cham-pioning that Commission. She looked at this same issue 18 years ago and de-termined that the Ninth Circuit was overly burdened and suggested changes be made to the structure of the Federal courts of appeal. So I look forward to working with my colleague from Alaska as we have identified this problem and now move forward to a solution. If there is some-thing we hear over and over again from the American people, it is this: You are not solving the problems facing this country. We have a problem. We have a solu-tion. I look forward to vigorous discus-sions and continuing to get more infor-mation, and I look forward to the al-ternatives. We think this is the best so-lution—to split the Ninth, add the Twelfth Circuit. Even after that is done—you take the Ninth and create the new Twelfth Circuit—the Ninth Circuit will still be the largest circuit by population in the United States. I again thank the junior Senator from Alaska for taking the lead in this effort and look forward to continuing this discussion. Mr. SULLIVAN. I appreciate my col-league’s efforts as well. We will con-tinue to be focused on this.

I will end by mentioning—my col-league mentioned the Sesame Street adage ‘‘One of these things is not like the other.’’ But one other area where this is the case, as I mentioned before, is in the en banc procedures. That is when the courts of appeal—every one of them in the country with the exception of one—when they have difficult issues, they sit together. All the active judges sit together. This provides uniformity and predictability in these courts. But one of these courts is not like the oth-ers. The Ninth Circuit cannot do this. It is too big. So they have developed what is called a limited en banc review, which by definition is incorrect and an oxymoron because ‘‘en banc’’ means the whole court. So that is why you have so many opinions in this court that are not uniform, that are problem-atic, and that undermine the adminis-tration of justice for the one in five Americans who is subject to this court’s jurisdiction. I look forward to working on this with my good friend the Senator from Montana and Members on both sides of the aisle. This should be a bipartisan issue for every Member of this body who wants to make sure their citizens have equal justice under the law. I yield the floor.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
REMEMBERING FORREST R. JARVIS ∑Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, today I wish to honor Forrest R. ‘‘Dick’’ Jar-vis, a beloved native of north central West Virginia who passed away on Jan-uary 27, 2016. Dick was a remarkable community leader, veteran, family man, and friend; and he left a tremendous legacy throughout my home State. Put sim-ply, Dick stood out among others. He was the epitome of what West Vir-ginians are all about, with his hos-pitable nature and unwavering com-mitment to helping those in need. Upon graduating from Rivesville High School in 1948, Dick enlisted in

the U.S. Navy, where he reported aboard the Destroyer USS Brownson DD 868 during the Korean war. His self-less service to our State and Nation is truly admirable and will never be for-gotten. Once discharged, he returned to West Virginia and entered the insurance business, where he retired as a sales manager after more than 25 years of service. Dick was an outstanding community leader and was also a member of nu-merous organizations. He was president of the Morgantown Life Underwriters Association and the West Virginia As-sociation of Life Underwriters and was a Life Underwriter Training Council Fellow. He was active in the Demo-cratic Party of Monongalia County and served two terms as county Democratic chairman. He served five terms on Star City Council and was president of the Monongalia County Volunteer Fire Companies Association for 10 years. Among his many accomplishments, Dick was instrumental in starting the MECCA 911 emergency dispatch center in Monongalia County and served as chairman of the policy board for more than 8 years. He was a lifetime member of the Star City Volunteer Fire Depart-ment, the VFW Post 548, the USS Brownson DD 868 Association, and the Tin Can Sailors Association. It is a very special individual who can sacrifice so much for our Nation, only to return home and continue the tradition of giving back to our commu-nities. Dick led by example and treated his neighbors as friends and his friends as family. He instilled this same loyal community service mindset through-out his family. He leaves behind his loving wife, Willa; his daughter Re-becca and her husband Reverend Mark Combs; his grandsons, Matthew and Alexander; and his dear brother Rob-ert. Dick was a beloved family man, friend, and inspiration to the Star City community. His glowing smile and positive attitude were contagious and will live on in the memories and hearts of all those who had the privilege of knowing him. Dick’s service was great-ly appreciated and will certainly never be forgotten.∑

TRIBUTE TO STEVE PRINGLE ∑Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, agri-culture is the backbone of our country. It is a significant economic driver, and perhaps more importantly, it offers our citizens a way of life that is unique in today’s world. Within agriculture, I often encounter thoughtful, committed men and women who work every day to raise their families, run their busi-nesses, serve their neighbors, and pro-vide a better future for the next gen-eration. Those qualities are found in Steve Pringle, who has served on behalf of Texas Farm Bureau for over 25 years. Under Steve’s leadership, the organiza-tion has influenced agricultural policy, promoted rural values, and worked to show an increasingly urban populace how food is produced. I met Steve many years ago, and over those years, we grew to be friends. As agricultural issues repeatedly came to the forefront of debate in Washington— from trade and energy, to the economy, overregulation, and the farm bill—he was always someone whom I could count on to give me trustworthy advice and counsel. Steve is a veteran, a husband, and a father. His long and distinguished ca-reer includes stints at the House Agri-culture Committee, Texas A&M Uni-versity, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. For over a quarter cen-tury however, Steve has been the face of Texas Farm Bureau. Steve’s passion for improving the lives of farmers and ranchers and advocating for the future of rural America has always impressed me. Steve Pringle embodies many traits we can all admire, including a deep gratitude for the hard-working families who provide the food, fuel, and fiber Americans rely on. Texas farmers and ranchers found in Steve Pringle a true public servant who worked hard to make certain their voices were heard on Capitol Hill. These traits have earned Steve the respect of his peers in Texas, in my home State of Kansas, and from across the country. Steve, we are grateful for your serv-ice and wish you and your wife, Linda, well in the next chapter of your life. ∑ f

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS By Mr. HATCH (for himself and Mr. L
EAHY ): S. 2510. A bill to encourage and facili-tate international participation in the performing arts and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, Senator H
ATCH and I are reintroducing the Arts Require Timely Service Act or ARTS Act. This bipartisan measure would assist nonprofit arts organiza-tions in obtaining visas for visiting for-eign artists. For many renowned art-ists abroad hoping to share their talent with American audiences, our visa sys-tem is often inconsistent and unreli-able. Although current law establishes a specific processing period for artist visas, petitioners regularly confront prolonged and uncertain wait times. This delay and uncertainty carries great costs for the nonprofit organiza-tions that seek to bring foreign artists to American audiences. While expedited visa processing is available, many of these organizations are unable to afford those fees, and the resulting delays in regular processing lead to interruptions and cancellations in performance schedules. Ultimately, the inefficiencies in obtaining foreign artist visas stifle the promotion of international cultural exchange and impede the mission of great American cultural institutions. The ARTS Act addresses these chal-lenges by requiring the Secretary of Homeland Security to provide expe-dited processing services, without a fee, if an O- or P- artist visa is not ad-judicated within a 14-day time frame, and the petition is filed by or on behalf of a nonprofit organization. The legis-lation ensures that nonprofit arts orga-nizations do not have to choose be-tween making adjustments to their programming and incurring additional unexpected costs. We should be encour-aging international participation in the performing arts, not thwarting it. That is why more than 80 national or-ganizations consisting of musicians, or-chestras, museums, performing artists, and local arts organizations such as the Vermont Symphony Orchestra, support the ARTS Act. I have long been a supporter of the arts and am proud of the great con-tributions the arts community has made in my home state of Vermont. Organizations such as the Vermont Symphony Orchestra, Vermont Per-formance Lab, and Burlington City Arts enrich our State’s dynamic cul-ture, are integral to our economy, and ensure that all communities benefit from the remarkable power of the arts. The ARTS Act acknowledges the

IKULSKI ) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions: 
S. R ES. 365 Whereas heart disease affects men, women, and children of every age and race in the United States; Whereas, between 2003 and 2013, the death rate from heart disease fell nearly 40 per-cent, but heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in the United States, taking the lives of approximately 370,000 in-dividuals in the United States and account-ing for 1 in 7 deaths nationwide; Whereas congenital heart defects are the most common birth defect in the United States, as well as the leading killer of in-fants with birth defects; Whereas, every year, an estimated 750,000 individuals in the United States have a heart attack, of which an estimated 116,000 individ-uals die; Whereas cardiovascular disease and stroke account for $316,000,000,000 in health care ex-penditures and lost productivity annually; Whereas cardiovascular disease and stroke will account for $1,393,000,000,000 in health care expenditures and lost productivity an-nually by 2030; Whereas individuals in the United States have made great progress in reducing the death rate for coronary heart disease, but this progress has been more modest with re-spect to the death rate for coronary heart disease for women and minorities; Whereas many people do not recognize that heart disease is the number 1 killer of women in the United States, taking the lives of 287,220 women in 2012; Whereas nearly 
2⁄3of women who unexpect-edly die of heart disease have no previous symptoms of disease; Whereas nearly 
1⁄2of all African-American adults have some form of cardiovascular dis-ease, including 48 percent of African-Amer-ican women and 46 percent of African-Amer-ican men; Whereas many minority women, including African-American, Hispanic, Asian-Amer-ican, and Native-American women and women from indigenous populations, have a greater prevalence of risk factors or are at a higher risk of death from heart disease, stroke, and other cardiovascular diseases, but such women are less likely to know of the risk; Whereas, between 1965 and 2016, treatment of cardiovascular disease for women has largely been based on medical research on men; Whereas, due to the differences in heart disease between males and females, more re-search and data on the effects of heart dis-ease treatments for women is vital; Whereas extensive clinical and statistical studies have identified major and contrib-uting factors that increase the risk of heart disease, including high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, smoking tobacco products, exposure to tobacco smoke, physical inac-tivity, obesity, and diabetes mellitus; Whereas an individual can greatly reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease through lifestyle modification coupled with medical treatment when necessary; Whereas greater awareness and early de-tection of risk factors of heart disease can improve and save the lives of thousands of individuals in the United States each year; Whereas under the Joint Resolution enti-tled ‘‘Joint Resolution to provide for the des-ignation of the month of February in each year as ‘American Heart Month’’’, approved December 30, 1963 (36 U.S.C. 101), Congress re-quested that the President issue an annual proclamation designating February as ‘‘American Heart Month’’; Whereas the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health, the American Heart Association, and many other organizations celebrate ‘‘Na-tional Wear Red Day’’ during February by ‘‘going red’’ to increase awareness about heart disease as the leading killer of women; and Whereas, every year since 1964, the Presi-dent has issued a proclamation designating the month of February as ‘‘American Heart Month’’: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Senate— (1) supports the goals and ideals of ‘‘Amer-ican Heart Month’’ and ‘‘National Wear Red Day’’; (2) recognizes and reaffirms the commit-ment in the United States to fighting heart disease and stroke by— (A) promoting awareness about the causes, risks, and prevention of heart disease and stroke; (B) supporting research on heart disease and stroke; and (C) expanding access to medical treatment; (3) commends the efforts of States, terri-tories and possessions of the United States, localities, nonprofit organizations, busi-nesses and other entities, and the people of the United States who support ‘‘American Heart Month’’ and ‘‘National Wear Red Day’’; and (4) encourages every individual in the United States to learn about the risk of the individual for heart disease. f SENATE RESOLUTION 366—RECOG-NIZING THE CULTURAL AND HIS-TORICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF LUNAR NEW YEAR Mr. COONS (for himself, Ms. H
IRONO , Mr. R
EID, Mr. K IRK, and Mr. R UBIO) submitted the following resolution; which was considered and agreed to: 
S. R ES. 366 Whereas Lunar New Year begins on the second new moon following the winter sol-stice, or the first day of the new year accord-ing to the lunisolar calendar, and extends until the full moon 15 days later; Whereas February 8, 2016, marks the first day of Lunar New Year for calendar year 2016; Whereas the 15th day of the new year, ac-cording to the lunisolar calendar, is called the Lantern Festival; Whereas Lunar New Year is often referred to as ‘‘Spring Festival’’ in various Asian countries; Whereas many religious and ethnic com-munities use lunar-based calendars; Whereas Lunar New Year began in China more than 4,000 years ago and is widely cele-brated in East and Southeast Asia; Whereas the Asian diaspora has expanded the Lunar New Year celebration into an an-nual worldwide event; Whereas Lunar New Year is celebrated by millions of Asian Americans, and by many non-Asian Americans, in the United States; Whereas Lunar New Year is celebrated with community activities and cultural per-formances; Whereas participants celebrating Lunar New Year travel to spend the holiday reunit-ing with family and friends; and Whereas Lunar New Year is traditionally a time to wish others good fortune, health, prosperity, and happiness: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Senate— (1) recognizes the cultural and historical significance of Lunar New Year; (2) in observance of Lunar New Year, ex-presses its deepest respect for Asian Ameri-cans and all individuals throughout the world who celebrate this significant occa-sion; and (3) wishes Asian Americans and all individ-uals who observe this holiday a happy and prosperous new year. f AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED

At the end of title II, add the following: Subtitle F—Heat Efficiency Through Applied Technology 
SEC. 2501. SHORT TITLE. 
This subtitle may be cited as the ‘‘Heat Ef-ficiency through Applied Technology Act’’ or the ‘‘HEAT Act’’. 
SEC. 2502. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds that— (1) combined heat and power technology, also known as cogeneration, is a technology that efficiently produces electricity and thermal energy at the point of use of the technology; (2) by combining the provision of both elec-tricity and thermal energy in a single step, combined heat and power technology makes significantly more-efficient use of fuel, as compared to separate generation of heat and power, which has significant economic and environmental advantages; (3) waste heat to power is a technology that captures heat discarded by an existing industrial process and uses that heat to gen-erate power with no additional fuel and no incremental emissions, reducing the need for electricity from other sources and the grid, and any associated emissions; (4) waste heat or waste heat to power is considered renewable energy in 17 States; (5)(A) a 2012 joint report by the Depart-ment of Energy and the Environmental Pro-tection Agency estimated that by achieving the national goal outlined in Executive Order 13624 (77 Fed. Reg. 54779) (September 5, 2012) of deploying 40 gigawatts of new com-bined heat and power technology by 2020, the United States would increase the total com-bined heat and power capacity of the United States by 50 percent in less than a decade; and (B) additional efficiency would— (i) save 1,000,000,000,000,000 BTUs of energy; and (ii) reduce emissions by 150,000,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide annually, a quantity equivalent to the emissions from more than 25,000,000 cars; (6) a 2012 report by the Environmental Pro-tection Agency estimated the amount of waste heat available at a temperature high enough for power generation from industrial and nonindustrial applications represents an additional 10 gigawatts of electric gener-ating capacity on a national basis; (7) distributed energy generation, includ-ing through combined heat and power tech-nology and waste heat to power technology, has ancillary benefits, such as— (A) removing load from the electricity dis-tribution grid; and (B) improving the overall reliability of the electricity distribution system; and (8)(A) a number of regulatory barriers im-pede broad deployment of combined heat and power technology and waste heat to power technology; and (B) a 2008 study by Oak Ridge National Laboratory identified interconnection issues, regulated fees and tariffs, and envi-ronmental permitting as areas that could be streamlined with respect to the provision of combined heat and power technology and waste heat to power technology. 
SEC. 2503. UPDATING OUTPUT-BASED EMISSIONS STANDARDS. 
(a) D EFINITIONS .—In this section: (1) ADMINISTRATOR .—The term ‘‘Adminis-trator’’ means the Administrator of the En-vironmental Protection Agency. (2) C
OMBINED HEAT AND POWER TECH -
NOLOGY .—The term ‘‘combined heat and power technology’’ means the generation of electric energy and heat in a single, inte-grated system that meets the efficiency cri-teria in clauses (ii) and (iii) of section 48(c)(3)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, under which heat that is conventionally rejected is recovered and used to meet ther-mal energy requirements. (3) O
UTPUT -BASED EMISSION STANDARD .—The term ‘‘output-based emission standard’’ means a standard that relates emissions to the electrical, thermal, or mechanical pro-ductive output of a device or process rather than the heat input of fuel burned or pollut-ant concentration in the exhaust. (4) Q
UALIFIED WASTE HEAT RESOURCE .— (A) I
N GENERAL .—The term ‘‘qualified waste heat resource’’ means— (i) exhaust heat or flared gas from any in-dustrial process; (ii) waste gas or industrial tail gas that would otherwise be flared, incinerated, or vented; (iii) a pressure drop in any gas for an in-dustrial or commercial process; or (iv) any other form of waste heat resource as the Secretary may determine. (B) E
XCLUSION .—The term ‘‘qualified waste heat resource’’ does not include a heat re-source from a process the primary purpose of which is the generation of electricity using a fossil fuel. (5) S
TATE .—The term ‘‘State’’ has the meaning given that term in section 302 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7602). (6) W
ASTE HEAT TO POWER TECHNOLOGY .— The term ‘‘waste heat to power technology’’ means a system that generates electricity through the recovery of a qualified waste heat resource. (b) E

HONORING MARINE SERGEANT ADAM C. SCHOELLER 
HON. LOU BARLETTA 
OF PENNSYLVANIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, February 8, 2016 Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I honor my constituent, Ma-rine Sergeant Adam C. Schoeller of Boiling Springs, and to express my deepest condo-lences to his family and friends. On January 14, 2016, Sgt. Schoeller and 11 of his fellow patriots went missing off of the coast of Oahu during a late night training ses-sion when the two CH–53E Super Stallion hel-icopters they were travelling in crashed. These honorable Marines tragically lost their lives while in the line of duty, and the American people are forever grateful for the service they provided to their country. Sgt. Schoeller graduated from Boiling Springs High School in 2008 and enlisted to serve his country with the United States Ma-rine Corps immediately afterward. Deployed during Operation Enduring Freedom, Sgt. Schoeller’s leadership and bravery distinguish his outstanding service to our nation, as evi-denced by the over 200 people who attended a vigil in his honor held at the Boiling Springs Clock tower and Veterans Memorial. Sgt. Schoeller received various honors such as the Air Medal, National Defense Service Medal, and the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal—decorations which are indicative of his dedication to our country. Sgt. Schoeller is survived by his wife, Samantha Wickel-Schoeller, whom he recently married on July 4, 2015. Samantha, his father Ralph, his mother Laurie, sister Shannon, and brother Collin were all able to travel to Hawaii through the Semper Fi Fund following this ter-rible tragedy. Mr. Speaker, please join me in honoring the life and service of Sgt. Adam C. Schoeller, for his selfless heroism and dedication to his fam-ily, community, and country.

PERSONAL EXPLANATION 
HON. GENE GREEN 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, February 8, 2016 Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to state that I was unable to vote on Thursday, February 4, 2016 due to district events our office is hosting in Houston and Harris County, Texas. If I had been able to vote, I would have voted as follows: On the Democratic Motion to Recommit H.R. 766, I would have voted ‘‘Yea.’’ On final passage of H.R. 766, the Financial Institution Customer Protection Act, I would have voted ‘‘No.’’ RECOGNIZING THE LUNAR NEW YEAR HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, February 8, 2016 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Lunar New Year and to applaud the significant contributions made by Chinese Americans to American life and cul-ture. Today, February 8, marks the first day of the ‘‘Year of the Monkey.’’ The Lunar New Year, or ‘‘Nian,’’ is a tradi-tion that has been celebrated for more than a thousand years by the Chinese and other per-sons of Asian ancestry. The Lunar New Year is cause for celebra-tion in communities all across our country but might I say that no city does it better than my home city of Houston, which will be hosting the Annual Lunar New Year Houston Celebra-tion this coming weekend. Celebrants will be treated to a variety of fes-tivities, including parades, festivals, art exhib-its, and musical performances. Mr. Speaker, Americans of Asian Pacific an-cestry have positively influenced our country through their strong commitment to family, faith, hard work, and service. They have enhanced and shaped our na-tional character with centuries-old traditions that reflect the multiethnic and multicultural customs of their communities. Asian Americans have enriched our culture and economy and made significant contribu-tions in every area of American life from the arts and humanities, to the natural and social sciences, to business and the economy, in government, sports, the military, and tech-nology and innovation. Notable Chinese Americans who have dis-tinguished themselves in the field of the arts and humanities include the two-time Academy Award winning cinematographer, James Wong Howe; Ang Lee, the Academy Award winning director; Maya Lin, the architect who designed the iconic Vietnam Veterans Memorial; I. M. Pei, the famous architect and designer of the Louvre Pyramid; Amy Tan, the best-selling au-thor of The Joy Luck Club; Yo-Yo Ma, the world-renowned cellist; and the legendary Bruce Lee, who revolutionized the martial arts film genre. In the field of business, American life has been enriched by the contributions of Steve Chen, the co-founder of YouTube; Jen-Hsun Huang, the co-founder and CEO of NVIDIA, the computer graphics card company; Min H. Kao, co-founder of Garmin, the GPS software giant; William Wang, the founder and CEO of Vizio; and Jerry Yang, cofounder of Yahoo. Mr. Speaker, Connie Chung made history as the first Chinese American woman to co- anchor a major network’s national news broadcast, as did Norman Bay, the first Chi-nese American United States Attorney; and Thomas Tang, the first Chinese American fed-eral judge. Many contemporary Chinese Americans have risen to occupy some of the most impor-tant positions in the nation, including my col-leagues, JUDYCHUand G RACE MENG, the first and second Chinese-American woman elected to the U.S. House of Representatives; Dr. Ste-ven Chum, Nobel laureate in Physics and United States Secretary of Energy from 2009– 2013; Hiram L. Fong, the first U.S. Senator of Chinese ancestry; Ed Lee, the Mayor of San Francisco; and Gary Locke, former Secretary of Commerce, Ambassador to China, and only Chinese American ever to serve as a Gov-ernor. Mr. Speaker, Kurt Lee was the first Asian American Marine Corps officer and he was fol-lowed by John Liu Fugh, the first Chinese American officer to be promoted to the rank of Major General in the United States Army and Coral Wong Pietsch, the first female Chinese American Army General; and it is a source of great pride that the Congressional Medal of Honor was awarded to Francis Wai, so far the only Chinese American to have been so hon-ored. In the fields of science, engineering, and medicine, Chinese Americans have made sig-nificant contributions that have fundamentally changed the way we live and work, including those of Min Chueh Chang, the co-inventor of the first birth control pill; Charles Kao, the 2009 Nobel laureate in Physics who pioneered the development and use of fiber optics in telecommunications; Yuan-Cheng Fung, the founder of modern biomechanics; and NASA astronauts Leroy Chiao and Edward Lu. Mr. Speaker, according to most recent data reported by the Census Bureau, there are more than 423,609 businesses owned by Chi-nese Americans generating $142.8 billion in economic output towards the U.S. economy, along with creating over 780,000 jobs. As the Member of Congress from the 18th Congressional District of Texas, I am honored to represent a district rich in cultural and eth-nic diversity and with a vibrant Chinese-Amer-ican community. Mr. Speaker, there are more than four mil-lion Chinese-Americans in the United States and Texas is home to more than 167,000 of them; of this latter number, approximately 25 percent, or 43,940, Chinese-Americans live in Harris County, making it the tenth largest com-munity of persons of Chinese heritage in the nation. Mr. Speaker, Chinese-Americans have made much progress in the United States since May 10, 1860, the date the first trans-continental railroad was completed. That massive construction project trans-formed our country for the better and could not have been completed had it not been for the labor of Chinese immigrants. Despite the enormous progress made chal-lenges still remain for persons of Chinese an-cestry, particularly the nation’s antiquated im-migration system which needs to be reformed to make it fairer and more humane. Celebrating the Lunar New Year helps us to remember how much our country has bene-fitted from the energy, creativity, and service of Chinese Americans.

HONORING CARLETON ZEISZ UPON THE OCCASION OF HIS RETIRE-MENT FROM PUBLIC SERVICE 
HON. BRIAN HIGGINS 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, February 8, 2016 Mr. HIGGINS. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize Carleton Zeisz as he is honored by the City of Tonawanda Democratic Committee upon his retirement from public service. Carl’s career spans an impressive twenty-four years of service. Carl began his tenure with the City of Tona-wanda as an Alderman in 1992 and 1993. He became the Common Council President in 1994, and held the post for twenty-two years, until 2015. In 2009, Carl earned the Out-standing Public Service Award from the Con-servative Party. Many major projects in the City of Tona-wanda have benefited from Carl’s efforts as he worked throughout the years together with the Mayor and Common Council. His efforts include the development of Gateway Park, the Niawanda Park Pavilion, the implementation of Central Dispatch, the development of Kibler High, closing the Tonawanda Landfill, the Ni-agara Street and Young Street development, and a multitude of other infrastructure projects. Carl’s greatest asset was his ability to get many to work together for the good of Tona-wanda. In addition to his career in public service, Carl has worked in General Cinema theaters for twenty-four years at eight different loca-tions, with twenty-one years in the position of General Manager. In 1989, he was recognized as General Manager of the Northeast for Gen-eral Cinema. For the past eleven years, Carl has worked at Maple Ridge 8. In 2015, Carl was recognized as Runner-up General Man-ager of the year, chosen from managers out of 341 AMC Theatres. I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Carl for his years of service to the City of Tonawanda and wishing him the best in his retirement from service.

RECOGNIZING THE HOLY ROSARY PARISH OF HAZLETON, PA ON ITS 100TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. LOU BARLETTA 
OF PENNSYLVANIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, February 8, 2016 Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to draw attention to a great, iconic Catholic church located in my district, one that was vital in my upbringing as a young man. My own Holy Rosary Parish in Hazleton, Pennsyl-vania is celebrating its 100th anniversary, and it remains a historic landmark within my con-gressional district, providing generations of people with a place to come together and wor-ship. Like many Catholics in the Hazleton area, I have many fond memories of events centered in and around Holy Rosary. My grandfather was one of the parish founders, and I, myself, took my First Holy Communion there and was confirmed in the church. I am a third-genera-tion member of Holy Rosary, my children are fourth-generation, and my grandchildren are fifth-generation. My personal experiences mir-ror those of countless others from our area, as we share the overall culture the church pro-vides for the citizens of Pennsylvania’s 11th Congressional District and beyond. Founded in April of 1916 as a mission church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, the church was originally established to serve the Italian immigrants of Hazleton’s south side. Since then, the church has continually en-gaged with the community at large and is re-garded as one of the most welcoming organi-zations in the region. To celebrate the church’s 100th Anniversary, the congregation has embraced a theme of remembering the past, celebrating the present, and preserving the future. Actively involved in the community, the Holy Rosary Parish of Hazleton hosts an annual Mass in honor of the Hazleton Fire Depart-ment, which includes a September 11th me-morial service. The church property includes a 9–11 Memorial and actual steel from the World Trade Center in commemoration of the brave men and women who responded to that day’s tragic events. The congregation also routinely engages with their homebound pa-rishioners—whether it is a priest providing Holy Communion, or a youth group member bringing a poinsettia at Christmas time. With an eye to the future, the church is also imple-menting a collaborative outreach effort with the purpose of providing evening meals and nightly shelter to the community’s homeless population during the winter months. Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to honor the Holy Rosary Parish of Hazleton, Pennsylvania as it celebrates its 100th anniversary, and I commend its congregation, both past and present, for their tireless efforts to preserve its longstanding legacy. f

PATRICIA SPENCER 
HON. KATHY CASTOR 
OF FLORIDA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, February 8, 2016 Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and to honor the life of an extraordinary leader and passionate advocate for freedom and justice, Ms. Patricia Spencer. Growing up in Montgomery, Alabama in the 1930s, Patricia Spencer followed in her moth-er and grandmother’s footsteps, becoming a member of the NAACP at the age of seven, a group of which she was still a member 72 years later. At the age of nineteen, while serv-ing as secretary of the local NAACP branch, Ms. Spencer received the news that her men-tor on the NAACP Youth Council, Rosa Parks, was arrested while riding the Montgomery bus. Ms. Spencer immediately started churning out fliers urging others to boycott the bus. During this time Ms. Spencer also babysat Yolanda King, the first eldest child of Martin Luther King, Jr. Ms. Spencer attended Alabama State Uni-versity and then moved to Orlando, FL to take a position as an operator with Southern Bell, the first African American to hold this position. From there she moved to Detroit and served 13 years on the local school board. In recogni-tion of her service to the Detroit area, the Mar-tin Luther King, Jr. High School Auditorium and the swimming facility at Charles Kettering High School bear her name. In the mid 1990s she moved to Tampa, FL. Once settled in she immediately started to volunteer with the Hillsborough NAACP branch, where she used her vast knowledge of the organization’s rules to mentor members and secure funding for the branch. She served as Membership Chair and Area Director for the NAACP’s state con-ference as well as Secretary of the Hillsborough County branch. She will forever be remembered for her constant efforts to boost NAACP membership. As a notable NAACPer, Ms. Spencer also co-chaired the Afro-Academic, Cultural, Technologic and Scientific Olympics. This pro-gram recruits high school students to compete in science and visual arts competitions. Though she gave countless hours to the orga-nization as a volunteer, she still had time to serve others. She was affiliated with other local organizations as well. At WUSF Radio Reading Service, she was a reader for the vis-ually impaired listeners tuned in to the station. She was a Board Member of Osher Lifelong Learning Institute (OLLI–USF), a non-degree- seeking program at the University of South Florida and she also served on the Board of the Early Learning Coalition. The American Red Cross was one of her favorite charities and she was the Vice President of Sisters Network, Inc., Tampa Chapter. She also was Chair of the Hillsborough County Public Schools—School Choice Committee. In 2007, Governor Charlie Crist appointed her as a member of the Hillsborough County Civil Service Board. Ms. Spencer will be forever remembered as a leader in the Tampa Bay community for her unequivocal support of justice and fairness. On December 14th, 2015, she passed away two days following her 79th birthday. Mr. Speaker, I join the Tampa Bay community in honoring Ms. Patricia Spencer for her lifelong commitment to service.

COMMEMORATING THE LIFE OF SEN. HARRIET SPANEL 
HON. SUZAN K. DelBENE 
OF WASHINGTON  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, February 8, 2016 Ms. D
ELBENE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Ms. Harriet Spanel, who recently passed away at the age of 77. Harriet served in the Washington State Leg-islature for more than two decades, rep-resenting Northwest Washington with im-mense dedication and conviction. Harriet had an intense passion for making her community a better place. She served on many local boards and committees, and took a hands on approach to what she saw as her civic responsibility. So it was no surprise that when Harriet de-cided to run for office and was elected to the state House, and then the Senate, she jumped in head first without hesitation. Throughout her political career, Harriet was a strong proponent for her constituents, stick-ing up for the local fishing economy and for the preservation of some of our state’s most beautiful lands She was a constant advocate for her com-munity, always fighting for what she believed would make a positive difference, however large or small. My heart goes out to all her family and friends. Harriet will be greatly missed by the countless lives she touched, but her presence through the work she accomplished will con-tinue to resonate in Whatcom, San Juan and Skagit counties as well as throughout our state for years to come.

RECOGNIZING LEHIGH CARBON COMMUNITY COLLEGE FOR ITS 50TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. LOU BARLETTA 
OF PENNSYLVANIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, February 8, 2016 Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to help commemorate the 50th anniversary of the establishment of Lehigh Carbon Commu-nity College. With humble roots in Schnecksville, Pennsylvania, the school was founded in 1966 and has expanded to include three modern satellite campuses serving more than 7,500 students in the Lehigh, Carbon, Schuylkill, and surrounding counties. As a student-centered learning institution, Lehigh Carbon Community College exempli-fies values that permeate all aspects of the higher education experience. Through prac-tical access to real-world skills, classroom di-versity that embodies the human experience, and quality teacher-student contact, Lehigh Carbon Community College offers students the tools they will need to meet the world’s most daunting challenges. In January 2005, Lehigh Carbon Community College received a 21st Century Learning Center Grant from the Pennsylvania Depart-ment of Education for the implementation of the Schools and Homes in Education (SHINE) after school program. This program was de-signed to address the before and after-school programs available to students in the commu-nity. The first full year proved to be a suc-cess—86 percent of classroom teachers in-volved noted significant improvement in home-work assignments, and kindergarten children improved an average of 32 percent in letter recognition, number recognition, and sound association. In the spring of 2006, Lehigh Carbon Com-munity College received notice that the pro-gram would receive additional funding for ex-pansion into Mahanoy Area and Shenandoah Valley School Districts. This new program was to focus on kindergarten through 5th grade, and has continued to show the value that after-school programs provide when coupled with exceptional leadership and resources. Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to recognize Lehigh Carbon Community College as it cele-brates its 50th anniversary. On behalf of a grateful community, I wish to thank the college and its members for their tireless service to the community and unwavering commitment to accessible education. f 
HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF MRS. JULIA AARON HUMBLES 
HON. CEDRIC L. RICHMOND 
OF LOUISIANA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, February 8, 2016 Mr. RICHMOND. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Julia Aaron Humbles, a New Orleans native and a lifelong civil rights activist. Mrs. Humbles passed away on Janu-ary 26, 2016, at the age of 72. In the 1960’s, Mrs. Humbles was among a group of young activists from New Orleans that organized sit-ins, and challenged unjust laws on buses traveling across the Deep South. Mrs. Humbles and her companions were arrested more than 30 times for their civil rights work. In 1961, Mrs. Humbles received national at-tention because of a photo of her and fellow activist David Dennis sitting on the front seat of a bus next to a soldier armed with a rifle and bayonet. Soldiers had been ordered to protect the Freedom Riders as they rode across the Deep South, determined to deseg-regate bus stations. By the age of 18, Mrs. Humbles was al-ready very active in the New Orleans chapter of the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) and was selected to be on the first Freedom Ride bus. Two New Orleanians, Mrs. Humbles and Je-rome Smith, were selected for the first Free-dom Ride bus, which ultimately was firebombed outside Anniston, Alabama. Fortu-nately, the two were not on that bus; they were in Orleans Parish Prison for picketing outside the segregated Woolworth stores on Canal Street. Mrs. Humbles graduated from the Charity Hospital School of Surgical Technology in New Orleans and worked as a surgical techni-cian for 30 years. In 1988, after the death of her husband, Joseph Lee Humbles Sr., she moved to Atlanta for a job at Northside Hos-pital. Mrs. Humbles’ legacy will forever be a part of the city and her dedication to justice em-bodies the spirit of New Orleans. Stories like hers will inspire generations of Americans to fight for their dreams. She will be sorely missed by her family, her friends, and all those who are able to pursue their dreams be-cause of her courage. Mr. Speaker, as a beneficiary of Mrs. Hum-bles courage, commitment and sacrifice, I cel-ebrate her life and legacy, because she has made America a more perfect union. With that, I yield back the balance of my time. f

TRIBUTE TO RUTH BERMAN AND CONSTANCE KURTZ 
HON. PATRICK MURPHY 
OF FLORIDA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, February 8, 2016 Mr. MURPHY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I along with Representatives T
EDDEUTCH and L
OISFRANKEL rise to recognize Ruth Berman and Constance Kurtz on the occasion of re-ceiving the SAGE Pioneer award this Satur-day, February 6, 2016. Ruth Berman and Constance Kurtz, affec-tionately known to all as Ruthie and Connie, are fierce, unyielding advocates and activists who have changed hearts and minds on LGBT rights, marriage equality, and women’s rights. Since falling in love and coming out in the 1970s, Ruthie and Connie have risen to na-tional prominence, successfully winning do-mestic partner benefits for City of New York employees in 1988. Additionally, through tele-vision appearances on The Phil Donohue Show, interviews with Geraldo Rivera and Bill Boggs, and their 2002 documentary ‘‘Connie and Ruthie: Every Room in the House,’’ they have connected with individuals worldwide and shown the personal impact of changing social climates. That commitment to the personal impact of love and acceptance continues through their work as certified counselors. In that capacity, they founded The Answer is Loving Coun-seling Center, where they have served for over twenty years. Additionally, they founded branches of Parents, Friends and Family of Lesbians and Gays (PFLAG) in Florida and New York. In 2000, they began serving as co- chairs of the New York State National Organi-zation for Women (NOW) Lesbian Rights Task Force.

I was privileged to introduce a bill this ses-sion with my colleagues S
UZANNE BONAMICI  and T
EDDEUTCH to expand the Older Ameri-cans Act (OAA) to improve services available for older LGBT adults. This legislation recog-nizes LGBT seniors as a vulnerable popu-lation, which will open the door for improved health and longterm care services for elders in the LGBT community. I, along with Representatives D
EUTCH and F
RANKEL , have known Ruthie and Connie for many years. They are my constituents and my inspiration for the bill. For decades, their advo-cacy and leadership in the LGBT community has not wavered as they have aged, but the services available to them and other aging LGBT adults are profoundly unequal to those of other American populations. Their living message inspired the Ruthie and Connie LGBT Elder Americans Act of 2015 (H.R. 3793). For these reasons and more, it is with great please that we join SAGE (Services & Advo-cacy for Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, & Transgender Elders) to recognize Ruthie and Connie for their lifetime of love and service.

OF LOUISIANA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, February 8, 2016 Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I rise to commemorate the 90th anniversary of the Louisiana Munic-ipal Association. Since January 28, 1926, the LMA has rep-resented over 305 villages, towns, cities, and parishes across the state of Louisiana. The three-fold mission of the LMA has been one of education, advocacy and service and includes advocacy at the national level. At the state level, they work to fight blight, promote the work of law enforcement and public safety efforts, and encourage economic growth. The LMA exemplifies the cooperation nec-essary to move our state forward. I’d like to recognize the accomplishments of the LMA over the last 90 years and thank them for their ongoing efforts.

HONORING NEW ORLEANS’ FIRST AFRICAN AMERICAN FIREFIGHTER 
HON. CEDRIC L. RICHMOND 
OF LOUISIANA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, February 8, 2016 Mr. RICHMOND. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 50th year since the City of New Orleans hired its first African American Firefighter. George Mondy was the first African Amer-ican to join the paid department as a profes-sional firefighter with the New Orleans Fire Department. Firefighter Mondy opened the doors to professional firefighting in February 1965. As he worked diligently to overcome ra-cial barriers of the times, his persistence and perseverance paid off. Firefighter Mondy was promoted to Fire Apparatus Operator to drive and operate the fire trucks. He retired in 1991, after 26 years with the department. Shortly after his retirement, Operator Mondy applied and was rehired as a fire supply technician. Firefighter Mondy was a trailblazer on whose shoulders many firefighters stand today. I be-lieve it was his can do attitude and manifesta-tion of competence that let the department know it was depriving itself and the City of New Orleans by not hiring African Americans. The late George Mondy’s name has been writ-ten in the history of the New Orleans Fire De-partment. Today, I submit Firefighter Mondy’s name to be written in the U.S. CONGRESSIONAL  R
ECORD . Mr. Speaker, as a beneficiary of the cour-age, commitment and sacrifice of Firefighter Mondy, I celebrate his life and legacy, be-cause he helped make America a more per-fect union. With that, I yield back the balance of my time.

REMEMBERING PHIL NEIGHBORS, COMMUNITY SERVANT 
HON. K. MICHAEL CONAWAY 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday February 8, 2016 Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and service of Phil Neighbors. Phil was a pillar in the San Angelo community, and I had the pleasure of working with him fre-quently over the last decade. Phil dedicated his life to three things: to God, his family, and his community. He and his wife, Susan, had two children to-gether, and four grandchildren. It wasn’t un-common for Phil to run straight to a city event from his grandsons’ ball games—he seemed to make time for everyone while placing the truly important things in life first. Phil was deeply ingrained in Angelo. A grad-uate of Angelo State University, he led the San Angelo Chamber of Commerce for the last 10 years. In this role, he strengthened the community and helped Angelo become a bet-ter place to live and raise a family. He dedi-cated his life to this calling, taking on many duties, none of which were too small or large, for the betterment of the community. One example was the bridge he helped build between the Goodfellow Air Force Base and the Angelo community. He established a strong and lasting bond for the betterment of both. He embraced our service-members, and was always willing to support them and our military in any way that he could. As a deacon in the Baptist church, Phil led the church’s college program and many mis-sion trips to Mexico. He was a selfless serv-ant, a trait that extended beyond the city, state, and country’s borders. Everyone felt and knew Phil’s warmness and thoughtfulness of others. His guidance and quiet diligence was reassuring to those around him and helped shape a community that is exemplary in Texas and the nation. Phil had no small part in cre-ating such a community. We lost Phil far too soon, just days after his 64th birthday. His loss will be felt across the community and state, and his service will not be forgotten. Please join me in remembering and celebrating the extraordinary life of our friend Phil Neighbors. RECOGNIZING THE OUTSTANDING SERVICE TO THE COMMUNITY OF TACOMA OF DR. DUNG XUAN NGUYEN HON. DEREK KILMER 
OF WASHINGTON  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, February 8, 2016 Mr. KILMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Dr. Dung Xuan Nguyen of Tacoma, WA. Dr. Nguyen has served his community with dedication and compassion through his medical practice and his outreach and support to local immigrant families. Dr. Nguyen has practiced in the Lincoln Dis-trict of Tacoma for forty years, offering medical service and strong advocacy for the uninsured and homeless in Tacoma’s Vietnamese-Amer-ican community. Mr. Speaker, for the past seven years, Dr. Nguyen has served as the President of the Vi-etnamese-American Community of Tacoma- Pierce County, which provides information and advocacy to the Vietnamese-American com-munity in the Tacoma region. Dr. Nguyen’s office is often a clearinghouse for ride-share services, community outreach and gatherings, and other essential services for new residents of the neighborhood. Mr. Speaker, Dr. Nguyen has even dedi-cated his time to help create public art to me-morialize the fallen soldiers of the Vietnam War—both U.S. and South Vietnamese serv-icemen. He designed and donated a black monolith memorial to the Vietnamese Cultural Center in Seattle in 2012 with the inscription ‘‘The Nation Will Always Remember Those Who Sacrificed.’’ Dr. Nguyen has shown dedication to com-munity and advocacy for those who need it. He has lived up to the values of our nation, welcoming immigrants to his community and honoring his adopted home through his work in the Tacoma community. Mr. Speaker, I’m proud to express my grati-tude for Dr. Dung Xuan Nguyen’s inspirational medical care and volunteerism to the lives of Tacoma’s citizens and their families today in the United States Congress.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Reverend Dr. Noah Spencer Smith and to recognize his decades of service to the citizens of Minneapolis. Born in Marion, Indiana in 1908, Reverend Dr. Smith’s parents enriched his childhood through music, art, and a lasting devotion to the African Methodist Episcopal church. After graduating high school in 1927, Reverend Dr. Smith’s love of music led him to drum in a jazz band, touring and composing songs for many years. He later took a job as a railroad dining car waiter to support his family. Eventually settling in Minneapolis and join-ing St. Peter’s AME Church, Reverend Dr. Smith was active in choir, Sunday school, and the Order of Service before answering his

deeper calling to enter the ministry. In 1960, Reverend Dr. Smith was ordained as an Itinerant Elder in the African Methodist Epis-copal Church, receiving a pastorate at St. Mark’s Church in Duluth, MN. He returned to Minneapolis in 1988 to serve the congregation of St. James’ Church, the oldest black con-gregation in Minnesota, until reaching the mandatory retirement age of 90. Reverend Dr. Smith was among the oldest graduates from three separate Minnesota col-leges. He earned an Associate of Arts degree from Minneapolis Community College at age 74, a Bachelor of Arts in Religious Studies from Macalester College at age 78, and a Master of Divinity degree from United Theo-logical Seminary at the age of 81. An excep-tional student, Reverend Dr. Smith received the Sidney Barrow Award in Religion during his time at Macalester, and in 2013 was be-stowed an honorary Doctorate of Ministry from United Theological Seminary at 105 years old. Reverend Dr. Smith was widely admired and respected both in the Minneapolis com-munity and in the African Methodist Episcopal Church worldwide. After his retirement from St. James’ at 90, he tirelessly worked for 16 more years as a member of the Wayman Church ministerial staff where he continued to preach, helped found the Wayman Church Bible Institute, taught Bible studies, and mentored many members of the clergy. Rev-erend Dr. Smith’s final ministerial act was September 6, 2015, giving a scripture lesson during service at Lily of The Valley Church in Apple Valley, Minnesota. Lily of the Valley Af-rican Methodist Episcopal Church is a church that he not only helped found, but was also the first AME church to open in Minnesota in nearly 80 years. Reverend Dr. Noah Spencer Smith passed away on September 24, 2015 at the age of 107. At the time of his death, Reverend Dr. Smith was the oldest active minister in the United States. His memory stands as an ex-ample for all in Minneapolis never to cease your calling. Through a deep dedication to his faith, he fostered a community that will blos-som for years to come.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, February 8, 2016 Mr. NOLAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Lisa Kruse of McGregor, Minnesota for being named 2015 Person of the Year by the Aitkin Age for her outstanding service to her community. As Director of Community Education Lisa works tirelessly to promote wellness to all peo-ple in her community. She has brought activi-ties to McGregor for all ages, from indoor re-cess equipment, to an ice rink at the High School, and to fitness classes for seniors. The programs Lisa helps bring to her com-munity go beyond physical health. Recently she attended training to educate others in her community on the impacts of Adverse Child-hood Experiences. She obtained grants to make McGregor schools a Reading Corps site where additional reading help is available for struggling students to promote literacy to early readers in kindergarten through third grade. Her assistance to McGregor’s Early Childhood program helped it earn Parent Aware’s highest rating of four stars. In addition to all she does to promote edu-cation and wellness Lisa was instrumental in bringing the Governor’s fishing opener to Ait-kin County for the first time ever. After four years of hard work by Lisa the 2016 Gov-ernor’s Fishing Opener will be held at Big Sandy Lake nearby her hometown. She is a great example of what it means to be an ac-tive citizen. Once again I would like to thank Lisa Kruse for all she does for her hometown of McGregor, Minnesota. f 
DELANO STEWART 
HON. KATHY CASTOR 
OF FLORIDA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, February 8, 2016 Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of an extraordinary leader and pillar of the Tampa Bay legal com-munity, Mr. Delano Stewart. Delano Stewart retired in July 2015 after an illustrious 50-year legal career in the state of Florida. A graduate of Hillsborough County public schools, Mr. Stewart went on to matric-ulate from Morehouse College and Howard University Law School. His memorable career began as the first African-American Assistant Public Defender in Hillsborough County’s his-tory. In 1970, he went on to open the first inte-grated law firm in the state of Florida. In addi-tion to his legal work, Mr. Stewart was the first African-American elected to the Board of Di-rectors of the Hillsborough County Bar Asso-ciation, and the first African-American member of the Rough Riders civic club. Mr. Stewart’s memorable career was shaped by many stalwart figures in the civil rights movement. At the age of 12, inspired by a visit from Thurgood Marshall, who was in Tampa as an NAACP attorney assisting in the African-American teachers’ campaign for equal pay, Mr. Stewart desired to become a lawyer. His passion for the civil rights movement was further stoked upon traveling to Washington, DC for Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s ‘‘I Have a Dream’’ speech. Additionally, Mr. Stewart is proud to champion Garland Stewart, the first African-American administrator in Hillsborough County school district history who played a key role in integrating the district, as the great-est influence on his life. Beyond his legal career, he founded The Delano S. Stewart Diversity Award which is given each year to an individual for lifetime achievements in improving the lives of African- Americans and promoting diversity in the legal profession. During this new chapter of his life, Mr. Stew-art plans on spending more time with his wife and their six children and eight grandchildren as well as working on his novel. In Delano Stewart’s own words he is not retiring, rather he is finding new ways to help people with his specialized legal training. Mr. Speaker, I join the Tampa Bay community in honoring Mr. Delano Stewart for his lifelong commitment to fairness and justice for all. NATIONAL SCHOOL COUNSELING WEEK HON. LINDA T. SA´NCHEZ 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, February 8, 2016 Ms. LINDA T. SA´NCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, earlier this week I introduced a reso-lution recognizing February 1–5th as National School Counseling Week. This resolution is an important one; school counselors are critical to the success of our students, particularly the ones who are at a high risk of dropping out. We ask much of our counselors. The rec-ommended counselor to student ratio is one to 250, while the national average is almost dou-ble that; one to 482. Each year, only 80% of students are graduating from high school. Schools desperately need more counselors who can put students on the path to success by ensuring they have the tools they need to graduate. In the spirit of properly recognizing hard-working school counselors across the country, today I wish to honor the work of an incredible school counselor and administrator from Montebello Unified School District, Andy Cos-tello. Recently retired, he spent much of his career working for Montebello Unified, and has become a pillar of our community. Mr. Costello has a passion for supporting and uplifting students and their families. Al-ways going above and beyond to make sure families received the best guidance and sup-port possible. Now retired, Andy continues to be engaged with the community. Mr. Costello is involved in counseling associations, and the college access program, College Bound Today, at Montebello Unified. It is important to recognize leaders like Mr. Costello. The true heroes of our community. The ones that help make our future brighter, by uplifting the next generation. He has had an immense impact on our community.

Mr. Speaker, born into an American energy family, Patrick Eu-gene Hosford arrived on February 6, 1936 in Seminole, Oklahoma where his father was working for what was then known as Gulf Oil. Eugene and June Hosford’s oldest son, like his father, would go on to graduate from the University of Oklahoma and immediately put his engineering degree to work in the energy industry. For many years, Pat worked for Pan Amer-ican, which became Amoco. Then Pat ven-tured out on his own forming his own energy companies and making his mark as an inde-pendent oilman. Pat even formed a manufac-turing company to make pup joints for the en-ergy industry. A quarter century ago Pat, and his lovely wife of 59 years, Colleen, whom he met on the campus at the University of Oklahoma, made The Woodlands their home. Their three sons all earned engineering degrees from the

University of Texas, which makes the annual Sooners-Longhorn match-up quite the event in the Hosford house. All three of Pat’s sons have made their mark on domestic energy production. Jim, John, and Mike, their wives, 9 children and two great-grandchildren are Pat’s pride and joy. Now retired, Pat finds being a grandfather to be as great a rush as striking oil. I had the privilege of being in the same Woodlands office building with Pat for years. Seeing Pat frequently meant I benefitted from his experience and insight into our area’s top business sector. His service on the Wood-lands-South Montgomery County Chamber of Commerce board was a great help in the early days of The Woodlands when we were work-ing to attract new energy companies to our community. Pat served wherever and when-ever he was needed with a smile on his face, a faithful heart, and an open door for anyone who needed solid advice or help. A man of strong faith, Pat has always been active in his local church. One of my funniest, if not strangest, memo-ries of Pat was seeing him, and other Wood-lands leaders, dressed up bizarrely and jok-ingly offering folks a chance to make a dona-tion or kiss a pig. Their over the top stunts made us laugh while raising a lot of money for the local United Way. Thank you will never be enough, Pat. Cathy and I are blessed to have you and Colleen as friends, as sounding boards and supporters since I first ran for office as a Texas State Representative. Today it is my privilege to honor Patrick Eugene Hosford on his 80th birthday and to wish him 80 more.

A LIFE-SAVING ACT OF KINDNESS 
HON. RICHARD M. NOLAN 
OF MINNESOTA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, February 8, 2016 Mr. NOLAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Minnesota State Trooper Glen Bihler and Mary Dinger of Aitkin, MN for their selfless acts of kindness toward a fellow Minnesotan in need of shelter on a cold winter night. Winters in Minnesota tend to be cold but the temperature on January 19th was particularly cold at 15 degrees below zero. Mary Dinger was driving along Highway 169 in Aitkin Coun-ty, Minnesota. At mile marker 249 Mary saw a man lying down on the side of the road. Al-though we are all taught not to stop and pick up strangers—particularly on dark rural roads late at night—Mary stopped to help and let the man warm up in her car while she called 911 and waited for a state Trooper to arrive. After Trooper Bihler picked up the man and con-firmed he did not have frostbite, Bihler brought him to a fast-food restaurant for a hot meal. Trooper Bihler said he was just doing what he could to help the man out. Afterwards he brought the man to the lobby of the Aitkin County Sheriff’s office, the only place open so late, where he could rest in a warm place until a ride could be arranged to a shelter in the Twin Cities. Once again I want to thank both Minneso-tans for the compassion and care they showed for a fellow citizen desperately in need. PERSONAL EXPLANATION HON. THEODORE E. DEUTCH

HONORING THE LIFE OF HAWAI‘I STATE SENATOR GILBERT KAHELE 
HON. TULSI GABBARD 
OF HAWAII  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, February 8, 2016 Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, on January 26, 2016, the Aloha State lost the Honorable Gil Kahele, a U.S. Marine, a Hawaii State Senator, and a loving husband and father. His life was extraordinary from beginning to end, and he will be sorely missed. Hawai‘i Island State Senator Gilbert Kahele was born to Peter and Rebecca Kahele, both of Hawaiian descent, in a grass shack by the sea on May 15, 1942 at Kalihi, just south of the Hawaiian fishing village of Miloli‘i in South Kona. His parents valued education, so in 1947, they moved the family to Hilo, 90 miles away when Gil was five years old. It was a big change for the Kahele family because Hilo was a bustling town after recovering from World War II and the 1946 tsunami. It was full of commerce, cars, buildings, sporting events, and multiple nationalities, a far cry from the isolated fishing village of Miloli‘i on the other side of the island. Gil attended Hilo High School and played on the Vikings football team—graduating with the class of 1960. After graduation, Gil began his long career of service to his country by joining the United States Marine Corps. Stationed at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, Twenty-Nine Palms and Camp Pendleton, California, Gil was part of the engineering troop responsible for refrigeration. As a young Hawaiian trav-eling through the South in the 1960’s, Gil re-members riding a bus across the country and seeing the discrimination of African Americans on buses, in bus stations, and restrooms in the South. He saw segregation for the very first time. The black man was treated dif-ferently than the white man in this part of the country, something that was uncommon to him growing up in Hawai‘i where everyone was treated with aloha. After four years serving as a Marine, Gil was honorably discharged and settled in Cali-fornia for a few years. His first son Gibson was born in October of 1963, and he attended Chapman and Laney Colleges in Northern California. After graduating with an Associate Degree in Science in 1967 from Laney Col-lege, Gil moved back to Hawai‘i where he began a civil service career that would last 33 years. He got a job with the Federal Govern-ment at Naval Station Wahiawa as a refrigera-tion mechanic. He married United Airlines stewardess Linda Haggberg in October of 1971, and the couple lived in Wahiawa. In 1976, the couple moved to Hilo. They had two children, Kai and Noelani. For the next 25 years Gil drove from Hilo up the Saddle Road to his job at the Pohakuloa Training Area, where he would eventually retire in 2000 as the Director of Public Works. During the 1980s, Gil spent a lot of time in Miloli‘i and made a name for himself as a suc-cessful community organizer in South Kona as a result of his ability to bring people together in the village to rally around a common cause or project. In 1986, Gil teamed up with Boone Morrison to produce a documentary, ‘‘Song of South Kona’’. Featuring Diana Aki, the film took a look at the history of the village and the songs that had been passed down through generations of musicians. Additionally, Gil, the president of Pa‘a Pono Miloli‘i at the time, suc-cessfully prevented the development of Kapua Bay and Kahuku by the Farms of Kapua and the Hawaiian Riviera Resort. Tragically, Gil’s younger sister Mona died in a car accident along with her husband Eric, leaving their three young children without par-ents. To Gil and Linda, family was their pri-ority, so they adopted the three children, Ihilani, Ilima and Imaika, and Gil began to spend more time in Hilo and less time in Miloli‘i. In 2011, Hawaii Governor Neil Abercrombie selected Gil Kahele to fill a vacancy in the State Senate, where he would end up serving for the remainder of his life. Gil boasted an im-pressive record rather quickly because of his sincere desire to make a difference for the people of the Big Island and all of Hawai‘i I recently saw Gil in Washington, DC, where as always, he was ready with a smile, a hug, a heart full of aloha. My heart is with the Kahele family (ohana), and all of Hawai‘i Is-land. Gil, you are missed. Thank you (Mahalo nui loa) for dedicating your life to serving oth-ers and for demonstrating how much we can achieve when we work together in the spirit of aloha. God bless you (Ke Akua me ke Aloha).

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD —Extensions of RemarksE131 February 8, 2016 
INTRODUCTION OF THE ‘‘RIGHTS FOR TRANSPORTATION SECU-RITY OFFICERS ACT OF 2016’’ 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, February 8, 2016 Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speak-er, today, I join with Representative N
ITA L
OWEY (D–NY) to introduce the ‘‘Rights for Transportation Security Officers Act of 2016,’’ legislation to ensure that the dedicated men and women that serve on the frontlines at our Nation’s airports have receive the rights and protections afforded to their counterparts with-in the Department and the Federal govern-ment. When the Transportation Security Adminis-tration (TSA) was established in 2002, in re-sponse to the September 11th attacks, Con-gress acted swiftly to transfer responsibility for security screening at airports from the private sector to the Federal government. We did so with the expectation that a system-wide ap-proach would be taken to protecting our Na-tion’s vital aviation sector and the passengers that are its lifeblood. Over the years, Congress has come to realize that some of the flexibili-ties that were provided to TSA when it was established were too broad and warranted re-finement. For instance, when Congress recog-nized that TSA’s exercise of acquisition flexi-bilities was not yielding the outcomes that TSA and the flying public need, TSA was required to comply with the Federal Acquisition Regula-tion, just like most other Federal agencies. We are introducing the ‘‘Rights for Transportation Security Officers Act of 2016,’’ because we believe that the time has come for TSA’s per-sonnel and labor management systems to be brought into compliance with the longstanding Federal systems and protections afforded to Federal workers under Title 5. TSA has had its fair share of challenges, particularly with respect to its personnel serv-ices. Repeatedly, there have been instances where TSA’s personnel system at attracting, retaining, and developing talent has fallen short. And with respect to labor management, the promise of the 2011 determination by then-TSA Administrator John Pistole has not lived up to its promise, insofar as the labor union that was elected as the exclusive rep-resentative for the Transportation Security Of-ficer workforce can only bargain and represent workers in limited cases and issues in dispute that may be raised to a neutral third party are limited. The fight for basic worker protections for Transportation Security Officers has been a long one. These dedicated individuals serve honorably on the front lines, protecting us from those who want to do us harm through our aviation sector. Back in 2007, we came close to ensuring that Transportation Security Offi-cers would be put under Title 5 but a veto threat from then-President Bush all but closed the door to getting the fix. When President Obama took office, the TSA workforce and many of us in Congress were hopeful that under new leadership, workers would get the rights and protections that had been denied to them for years. However, now that we have seen successive TSA Administrators fail to ad-dress longstanding unsettled workforce issues, it is imperative that Congress come together and enact legislation that will grant the work-force rights and benefits that they deserve. I hope that other Members will join myself and Representative LOWEY and support this important legislation.

INTRODUCTION OF SEAT EGRESS IN AIR TRAVEL (SEAT) ACT 
HON. STEVE COHEN 
OF TENNESSEE  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, February 8, 2016 Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the Seat Egress in Air Travel (SEAT) Act. This bill would direct the Federal Aviation Adminis-tration (FAA) to establish minimum seat size standards for passenger seats on aircrafts op-erated by carriers in the U.S. for the health and safety of passengers. Consumers are tired of being squeezed— both physically and fiscally. The average dis-tance between rows of seats has dropped from 35 inches before airline deregulation in the 1970s to about 31 inches today. The aver-age width of an airline seat has also shrunk from 18 inches to about 16
1⁄2. This isn’t just a matter of comfort. It is about safety and health. The FAA requires that planes be capable of evacuation in 90 sec-onds or less, but the FAA hasn’t conducted emergency evacuation tests on airlines with a distance between rows of less than 29 inches. Some airlines fly with rows as close as 28 inches apart. Furthermore, doctors warn of deep vein thrombosis which can afflict pas-sengers who don’t move their legs enough on longer flights. Moreover, average seat sizes have been shrinking while the average size of Americans has been growing. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the aver-age man in 1960 weighed 166, and the aver-age woman weighed 140 pounds. Now the av-erage man is 196 pounds and the average woman is 166 pounds—and both are about an inch taller. This just doesn’t make any sense. I hope that Congress will quickly act on this bill to di-rect the FAA to establish minimum seat size standards to provide appropriately for the safety and health of airline passengers.

INTRODUCTION OF THE ‘‘MAKING YOUR RETIREMENT ACCESSIBLE ACT’’ OR THE ‘‘
MYRA ACT’’ 
HON. JOSEPH CROWLEY 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, February 8, 2016 Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to introduce, along with Congressman K
EITH E
LLISON , the ‘‘Making Your Retirement Acces-sible Act,’’ also known as the ‘‘myRA Act,’’ to help address the savings and retirement secu-rity crisis in America. Here are a few startling facts: According to a 2015 Federal Reserve Re-port, 31 percent of non-retired individuals said they have no retirement savings or pension whatsoever. Among workers who do not participate in a 401(k) or other defined contribution plan, 42 percent say that is because their employer does not offer one. For part-time workers, it can be even more difficult, as a 2015 BLS Economic Release found that 62 percent of part-time workers don’t have access to a retirement plan at work. To address this looming crisis, the Obama Administration recently launched the myRA program to help workers who face obstacles to saving, such as by not having access to an employer-sponsored retirement plan or not having enough in personal funds to purchase and contribute to their own IRA. The myRA program allows workers to open their own retirement savings account with as little as $1, and gives them the ability to make automatic payments every pay period. Employers would only be responsible for setting up a payroll deduction for employees to create and deposit funds into their individ-ualized myRA accounts. myRA accounts not only encourage workers to build a nest egg for their future, but also give workers peace of mind that they can ac-cess these funds in emergencies. Under the myRA program, participants can withdraw funds from their account tax-free and penalty-free—so these funds can be used as an emergency rainy-day fund as well as a fu-ture retirement account, further breaking down a barrier against savings. The funds invested go solely into U.S. Gov-ernment savings bonds, ensuring these ac-counts remain stable, not at risk in the market. Further, the accounts do not have any asso-ciated maintenance charges or fees, which means every dollar that is invested will be re-turned—plus interest—to the account holder. Recognizing most Americans will have a number of jobs in their lifetime; myRA ac-counts are also portable, allowing employees to change jobs while still being able to easily maintain their accounts. The Administration has taken an important step forward by using their existing legal au-thority to create this program. I salute them for their actions in creating this program. The myRA program represents an important saving tool, and as such it should be wel-comed as more than just an administrative program—it should be codified into law. Today, Congressman ELLISON and I are tak-ing that next step to ensure this worthwhile program can continue, allowing everyone in our country to plan ahead for a secure retire-ment for themselves and their families.
