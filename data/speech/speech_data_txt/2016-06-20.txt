Eternal God, as the final game of the National Basketball Association re-minded us of redemption, we place our confidence in You, the Redeemer of hu-manity. Be exalted, O God, above the highest Heaven. May Your splendor shine over all the Earth. Today, use our Senators to do mighty things for Your glory. May they settle for nothing less than their best efforts to fulfill Your purposes. As they depend on Your strength, do for them more than they can imagine. Em-power them to strengthen the founda-tion of justice, righteousness, and truth, doing their part to accomplish Your will. Lord, make our lawmakers so sen-sitive to Your grand vision for our Na-tion that they will be a conscience for our citizens in calling them back to You. We pray in Your sacred Name. Amen.

FIGHTING TERRORISM Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, the terrorist attack that claimed 49 inno-cent victims in Orlando left families broken and our country shaken. It was a deliberately targeted attack inspired by the hateful ideology of ISIL, and it tragically reminded us of the con-tinuing threat of ISIL-directed and ISIL-inspired attacks right here in our country. We know that the way to prevent more of these terrorist attacks is to ac-tually defeat ISIL where it trains, op-erates, and prepares for attacks, like in Iraq and Syria. The President at least appeared to recognize that this weekend when he said that ‘‘we are and we will keep doing everything in our power to stop these kinds of attacks and to ulti-mately destroy ISIL.’’ But as the Nation just learned from CIA Director John Brennan, ISIL re-mains ‘‘a formidable, resilient, and largely cohesive enemy.’’ Our efforts thus far ‘‘have not reduced the group’s terrorism capability and global reach’’—this is Brennan—and ISIL is ‘‘training and attempting to deploy operatives for further attacks’’ in the West. It is evident that the President’s campaign to contain ISIL has not been sufficient to defeat this group abroad or prevent more ISIL-inspired attacks right here at home. He needs to finally lead a campaign to accomplish this ob-jective or at least prepare the military and intelligence community to help the next President do so if he won’t. Here in the Senate, we should con-tinue our efforts to fight terror beyond our borders and prevent attacks within them. These have been priorities for Republican Senators for a long time, and they continue to be at the fore-front of our efforts now. We have offered proposals to help connect the dots with respect to ter-rorist communications. We have of-fered proposals to help address the threat of lone-wolf attacks like the one we saw in Orlando. And we have offered proposals to help ensure terrorists are not able to purchase weapons. We will consider two of them today, along with two Democratic alter-natives. The first proposal, from Sen-ator CORNYN , would immediately block the sale of a firearm or explosive or ex-plosives to a suspected terrorist and, once probable cause is shown, not only permanently block that sale but also allow the suspected terrorist to be ar-rested and detained. This would apply to anyone currently investigated as a terrorist suspect as well as to anyone who was investigated within the last 5 years. Unlike Senator C
ORNYN ’s proposal, the Democratic alternative would not—would not—prevent a terrorist from buying explosives as the alter-native pertains only to firearms. Un-like Senator C
ORNYN ’s proposal, the Democratic alternative would not no-tify State and local law enforcement when a terrorist tries to buy a weapon nor would the alternative even give au-thority for that terrorist to be arrested or detained. Unlike Senator C
ORNYN ’s proposal, the Democratic alternative would not ensure due process, protect our con-stitutional rights, or require the gov-ernment to periodically review its pro-cedures to ensure it is investigating the right people. The second proposal, from Senator G
RASSLEY , would improve the back-ground check database by helping en-sure all levels of government are actu-ally submitting the necessary records, including mental health records. It would also allow for additional re-sources to update and improve the sys-tem further. Unlike Senator G
RASSLEY ’s proposal, the Democratic alternative would not study the causes of mass shootings. Unlike Senator G
RASSLEY ’s proposal, the Democratic alternative would not help prevent failed gun walking oper-ations like Fast and Furious. Unlike Senator G
RASSLEY ’s proposal, the Democratic alternative would not require the Department of Justice to

explain why it has not been using the gun laws already on the books to pros-ecute gun cases. We know that weap-ons-related convictions under the Obama administration are down more than 30 percent compared to a decade ago. So, look, no one wants terrorists to be able to buy guns or explosives—no one. Instead of using this as an oppor-tunity to push a partisan agenda or craft the next 30-second campaign ad, colleagues like Senator C
ORNYN and Senator G
RASSLEY are pursuing real so-lutions that can help keep Americans safer from the threat of terrorism. They are approaching this serious topic in a serious and constitutional way. They also understand that ultimately the most important way to prevent more terrorist tragedies at home is by defeating terrorism overseas. Serious solutions—that is what the American people now demand more than ever. That is where we should keep our focus.

GUN VIOLENCE Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have an epidemic of gun violence. It is here. I wish it weren’t, but it is here, and it is getting worse every day. Last week’s attack at a popular night club in Orlando, FL, was the deadliest shooting in modern American history. It was an act of hate and an act of terror. Forty-nine people were killed, and dozens were wounded. Many of those wounded are going to suffer for the rest of their lives from paralysis, blindness, and other maladies caused by the evil of Mr. Mateen. Sadly, mass shootings are occurring with sickening regularity in our coun-try. Let’s just talk about some of them in recent years. Tucson, AZ, 2011: Six were killed, and a number were injured, one of whom was Gabby Giffords—a wonderful, won-derful human being. She was critically injured. Her good husband, a famous astronaut, is doing everything he can to make her life as normal as possible. Carson City, NV, 2011: Four were killed in a popular restaurant in Car-son City called Heidi’s. Three of the dead were National Guardsmen getting ready to do their duty, having a break. In fact, they were having breakfast when they were gunned down by a mad-man. Aurora, CO: People there watching a popular movie in 2012 were gunned down in a night of terror. Newton, CT, 2012: Twenty little kids—20 babies—and six educators were killed. The Navy Yard, Washington, DC, 2013: Twelve were killed. Las Vegas, NV, 2014: A couple of peo-ple had just left the Bundy domestic terror situation. I guess they didn’t get enough opportunities to do terrible things up there. So they came to Las Vegas and went to a restaurant where two police officers were sitting there having breakfast—two men with fami-lies. This man and woman walked up, having left the Bundy enclave, and shot both of them in the head right in front of everybody. They walked out, went next door to Walmart, and killed another unsuspecting shopper. Charleston, SC, 1 year ago: Nine were killed in a church—praying and sing-ing. That is what you should do in a church, but a murderer was there, and he killed nine of them. Roseburg, OR, 2015: Nine were killed at a community college. Colorado Springs, CO: Some crazy person hell-bent on doing something in his own mind—stopping abortion— killed three innocent people. They had nothing to do with abortion. They were just innocent people. San Bernardino, CA: In a government facility, people there for a holiday cele-bration were maimed and 14 killed by two domestic terrorists. Kalamazoo, MI, 2016: An Uber driver picked up a fare, drove around town to kill another one and got six. So if we add these up, it comes to 100, not counting the 49 who were killed a week or so ago. We add to that the 90 who are killed every day—90 every day—with guns in America. That is a pretty staggering number. But after the murders I have outlined here—Tucson; Carson City; Aurora; Newton, CT; DC; Las Vegas; Charles-ton, SC; Roseburg, OR; San Bernardino, CA; Colorado Springs, CO; Kalamazoo, MI—the American people have looked to Congress to stop them. No more, they say. The American people don’t feel safe. They want to feel safe. They want the violence to stop. They want it to end. But instead of getting help from their elected officials, our con-stituents see a disturbing pattern of in-action. It is always the same. After each tragedy, we Democrats try to pass sensible gun safety measures. Sadly, our efforts are blocked by the Repub-lican Congress, which takes its march-ing orders from the National Rifle As-sociation. In April 2013, just months after the shootings in Aurora and Newtown, Democrats proposed legislation that would expand background checks and reinstate the assault weapons ban, limit the size of ammunition clips. The man who went into the nightclub a week ago had an assault rifle that would hold a magazine of 30 shells. He could fire that every time he pulled the trigger. It would take him about 3 or 4 seconds to empty the 30 shells. He could reload in 1 or 2 seconds. We don’t know for sure, but he had at least two extra clips, so 90 bullets. Does anyone think there is anything you hunt in America that requires 90 bullets? Is there anyone who thinks that in Amer-ica you need 30 bullets to go hunting— for what? Well, the man in Orlando, FL, went hunting for people. We tried to limit the size of ammuni-tion clips, to prevent firearms traf-ficking, but the NRA didn’t accept any of our proposals, and so the Senate Re-publicans didn’t accept them and they filibustered and blocked every one of them. It happened again last December. Following the shooting in San Bernardino, Senator FEINSTEIN pro-posed legislation to close the so-called terror loophole. Senator F
EINSTEIN ’s bill would have prevented suspected terrorists from legally purchasing fire-arms and explosives. Keeping terrorists from buying guns should be something upon which every Member of the Sen-ate agrees. Again, the NRA said no, the Republicans said no, and they blocked Senator F
EINSTEIN ’s legislation. That is a pattern we see. We see it repeat-edly. It doesn’t matter how sensible the legislation or how terrible the trag-edy, the Republicans are beholden to the National Rifle Association, the NRA, and not the people who elect them to come here and represent them. Today I am afraid it will be more of the same. About 2 hours from now, the U.S. Senate will have an opportunity to stop the rampant gun violence that has plagued our Nation. Stop it all? No, but it certainly will do something. So, at 5:30, Senators will vote on four gun- related amendments, two from Demo-crats, two from Republicans. Two of these amendments—the Murphy and Feinstein amendments—are serious proposals to protect Americans from gun violence. The Murphy-Booker- Schumer amendment would close loop-holes in our background check system and ensure that firearms and explo-sives are kept out of the hands of ter-rorists and criminals and those who suffer from mental illness. Senator F
EINSTEIN ’s amendment would close the terror loophole, which allows suspected terrorists to legally purchase weapons and explosives. Both of these proposals are in keeping with what America wants and what America needs. About 90 percent of Americans favor expanded background checks, and more than 80 percent of Americans want to close the terror loophole. These are Democrats, Republicans, and Independents. I might say, as to the National Rifle Association, all NRA Members don’t feel the way the leaders of the NRA do. Even though 90 percent of Americans favor expanded back-ground checks and more than 80 per-cent want to close the terror loophole, Republicans will again, I am confident, reject the voice of the American peo-ple. Instead, Republicans are proposing legislation that will actually make it easier for someone who has a mental illness to get a gun. Instead, Repub-licans are proposing legislation that will actually make it more difficult for law enforcement to keep guns out of the hands of the dangerous. The first Republican amendment pro-posed by the senior Senator from Iowa would make it easier for a person with severe mental illness to buy a gun.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4335 June 20, 2016 
That is what it says. The Republicans would make it easier for one who just gets out of a psychiatric facility to walk out of a psychiatric facility and go buy whatever he wants in the way of firearms. The second Republican amendment, the Senator from Texas proposed legis-lation that would allow the sale of fire-arms to terrorists after a brief 72-hour waiting period, which would com-promise ongoing counterterrorism in-vestigations. The Grassley and Cornyn amendments are political stunts that are meaningless in doing something to stop gun violence. These are amend-ments to divert attention from real legislation. Why? So Republicans can say: Hey, look, we tried. And all the time they are cheerleaders to the bosses at the NRA who are cheering them. My Republican colleagues are again stuck in the same rut, the same warp, giving in to the demands of the NRA. The Republican leaders always find an excuse to say no. Democrats look at any reasonable proposal when it comes to gun safety. Right now there are Democrats like Senator H
EINRICH who are working with Republicans to find a solution. We are open to any of their ideas, provided the legislation really does keep guns and explosives away from suspected terrorists, criminals, and people with mental illness—but we know the NRA will never support any of these proposals. That is why we need the Senate Republicans to take a stand against gun violence and against the NRA. As I stand here, the NRA is sending a lot of direct mail. They are even get-ting better now and putting stuff on the Internet, saying: We need more money. They are trying to take your guns away from you. It is a fundraising operation. What we need is the Senate Republicans to take a stand against gun violence and against the NRA for a change. If they don’t—if the Senate Re-publicans continue down this path and reject the Feinstein and Murphy amendments, it will be the third time recently they walked away from sen-sible gun legislation. It will be the third time recently Republicans have walked away from sensible gun legisla-tion and will be the third time Repub-licans will have voted to give suspected terrorists, criminals, and the mentally ill access to firearms. It will be the third time recently that the Senate Re-publicans have protected the gun lobby, even as their own constituents have been gunned down in cold blood. The Senate Republicans should be embarrassed, but they are not because the NRA is happy. The Republicans need to put the lives of innocent Amer-icans ahead of the NRA. I yield the floor and ask the Chair to announce the business of the day.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Vermont. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, a few days after the mass shooting in Or-lando, I received a very powerful letter from Ella Staats, a young Vermonter who, like Americans across our land, was sickened and horrified by this senseless act of hatred that we saw in Orlando. What was pointed out to me in this letter, this eloquent, passionate heart-felt letter, is that Ella is 15 years old. In her letter addressed to me, under the auspices of the Young Writers Project, she explained that even at her age, she has ‘‘already seen so many mass shootings that it is becoming harder and harder to faze [her].’’ Ella calls on Congress to act, writing: ‘‘It is time that the gun laws in our country were completely reformed’’ so these violent and hateful acts will be pre-vented. After I read and reread her eloquent letter, I was moved. I sat down in my home in Vermont, and I started to draft a response, going through all the votes I had taken over the years. I started looking up all the hearings I had convened on gun violence, all the bills I authored and cosponsored, those I moved through the Judiciary Com-mittee and even on the Senate floor, but then I stopped—this was just a catalogue. I decided the nature and the quality and the moving aspect of Ella’s letter deserved a response on the Senate floor because Ella has given voice to some-thing urgent that many people in Vermont and across the country are feeling right now. Here is my reply to Ella: Dear Ella, thank you for your thoughtful letter. I have read it several times and I want you to know how powerful it is to speak up about issues as important as this one. Some worry that many of your generation have dis-engaged from involvement in the big issues of our day, but your letter gave me hope. You are right. It is long past time for Congress to reform the laws that allow mass gun violence to flour-ish in our country. You deserve to feel safe. You should not have to fear that guns designed for the battlefield will end up in the hands of terrorists or violent criminals. A large majority of our fellow Americans feel just as we do and support sensible answers. But your government has let you down. Time and time and time again, commonsense remedies are thwarted by obstruction and inertia and powerful lobbies, and only if more people like you stand up will we be able to change this. Ella, I want you to know that I have been working for years to find prac-tical solutions that will stop the gun violence that continues to touch every corner of our country. But I bet that the last thing you want is a list of all the bills I have written or voted for but have not passed. You want to know how we are going to overcome the well- funded opposition to passage of laws that will reduce gun violence. First, we must remember the amaz-ing men, women and children who die from gun violence every day. Sadly these tragedies are not limited to mass shootings. It is essential that we pay attention to the loss that thousands of mothers and fathers, sons and daugh-ters feel each day because of a shooting that could have been prevented. Second, we need new voices like yours. We need you to hold us account-able. We need more people to demand reform so that we can finally overcome the well-funded opposition to common-sense laws that would keep guns out of the hands of criminals and terrorists. Ella, I share your frustrations and I beg you not to become numb to this hatred and violence. I urge you to speak out in your community, on so-cial media and to demand account-ability. It often takes time—too long a time—but speaking out, sharing your ideas and views, and contacting your elected representatives makes a dif-ference. I hope the votes that I cast on your behalf tonight demonstrate that I hear you and I agree that we must act to prevent the next Orlando. Ella, thank you for doing that—for speaking out and for holding us accountable. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-sent that Ella Staat’s full letter be printed in the R
ECORD . There being no objection, the mate-rial was ordered to be printed in the R
ECORD , as follows:

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES4336 June 20, 2016 
(By Ella Staats ) D
EARSENATOR LEAHY : I am a Vermont teen who has been deeply saddened by the Orlando shooting. I am en-raged at this terrible act of targeted violence against the LGBT+ community, saddened by the immense loss of life, and mourning for the victims and their families. It is time that the gun laws in our country were completely reformed. It is time that people with such senseless hatred cannot commit such a terrible crime so easily. I would expect and, frankly, hope that you and every Congressperson around the United States are receiving thousands more letters like this one. Because something needs to change. I am a teenager growing up in a world where, at 15, I have already seen so many mass shootings that it is becoming harder and harder to faze me. But the homophobia, and the scale of this attack deeply disturb me. I may not know everything about politics, but I am urging you to please, please do something. Some-thing big. This may not be a long letter, but I hope I have gotten my point across. I am tired of excuses. I am tired of waiting. I am tired because I know this is not the last awful shooting I will see in my lifetime. Un-less this government finally steps up and makes a change, this will continue to be the norm. And a country where something like the Orlando shootings is commonplace is not a country I want to spend the rest of my life in. 
Mr. LEAHY. Like Ella, Marcelle and I continue to mourn the deaths of 49 in-nocent people in Orlando just over a week ago. Just a year ago we were mourning the loss of 9 parishioners who were murdered in their church by a hateful domestic terrorist. It is unac-ceptable that hundreds more have died as a result of mass shootings since that tragic day in Charleston. This includes the victims killed at military facilities in Tennessee, a college in Oregon, a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado, an office gathering in San Bernardino, and dozens of other communities around the country. Enough is enough. Ella is rightfully tired of excuses—and so am I. We can-not accept that daily shootings are the new normal. I was proud to join Sen-ator M
URPHY , Senator B OOKER , Senator B
LUMENTHAL , and others here on the Senate floor last Wednesday in a call to action, and I commend those Sen-ators for their determined leadership last week. We have to do something. Congress must act. When Democrats were last in the ma-jority in the Senate, I was Chairman of the Judiciary Committee last Congress and we took action. We convened hear-ings, debated and reported out sensible legislation to punish criminals who traffic in firearms, to close loopholes that allow criminals to acquire guns, and other measures to prevent mass shootings. We had broad support from the public and a bipartisan group of Senators. But Senate Republicans blocked every single one of these re-sponsible proposals. And since re-tak-ing control of the Senate, Republicans have stood in the way of even the most modest reforms. There have been no hearings and there was no willingness to allow votes on any gun violence leg-islation until Democrats took a stand. Last week, Democrats demanded ac-tion on this issue, and tonight we will have four votes, and Americans across the country will know where each Sen-ator stands. I am a responsible and proud gun owner, and most Vermonters know we should do everything we can to keep guns out of the hands of sus-pected terrorists. In order to do that, we must close the loophole that allows suspected terrorists to pass the back-ground checks conducted at gun stores. Senator FEINSTEIN ’s amendment would give law enforcement the discretion to actually stop the sale of a gun to a known or suspected terrorist who pre-sents a public safety threat. Had Sen-ator F
EINSTEIN ’s amendment been law when the Orlando shooter attempted to buy his assault weapon, the FBI would have had notice to see what he was doing and could have prevented the tragedy in Orlando. The Department of Justice, which includes the FBI, sup-ports Senator F
EINSTEIN ’s amendment and I support this commonsense amendment. Closing the ‘‘terror gap’’ is not enough. If a potential terrorist is pre-vented from buying a gun in a local store, we have to ensure that he cannot simply buy the same gun online with-out any sort of background check. If background checks are not universal— online, at gun shows, and everywhere else—then what is the point? Senator M
URPHY ’s amendment closes a major loophole by requiring background checks for every firearm sale, includ-ing gun shows and Internet sales—with reasonable exceptions including trans-fers to close family members. The amendments offered by Senators F
EINSTEIN and M URPHY are sensible ap-proaches that will help stop the gun vi-olence that is plaguing our Nation. In contrast, the alternatives offered by Senators C
ORNYN and G RASSLEY do not adequately address the problems we face—and in some respects they make things worse. The Cornyn amendment would impose impractical and unneces-sary burdens on law enforcement, and could allow a known or suspected ter-rorist to buy a gun even when the gov-ernment has filed an emergency peti-tion to block the sale. And the Grass-ley amendment does nothing to fix the gaping holes in the background check system. I am concerned that the Grass-ley amendment could actually make it easier for individuals with known men-tal illnesses to obtain firearms. Anyone who is watching this debate to deter-mine which proposals would help pre-vent the next Orlando tragedy need to understand that neither the Cornyn nor Grassley amendments would have stopped the Orlando shooter from get-ting his guns. Congress must pass bills that fix loopholes in a responsible way, not create more dangerous gaps in our gun laws. The vast majority of Americans sup-port stronger background checks. They want to prevent terrorists of all types from obtaining guns. When I pick up a firearm from a gun store in Vermont, even though the person may have known me all his life, I have to go through a background check. That does not bother me a bit. But I do not want somebody who has warrants out-standing against them or restraining orders from their spouse against them to be able to walk into a gun show and buy the same weapon with no back-ground check. If Senators listen to their constituents, they will do the right thing and vote for the Feinstein and the Murphy amendments to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and suspected terrorists. And they will vote against the Cornyn and Grassley amendments. In the wake of mass gun violence, whether the victims are members of the LGBT community, African-Amer-ican church parishioners, first graders in an elementary school, college stu-dents, or military servicemembers or others in our community, we are called to come together in solidarity as Americans. We must come together in support of the victims, their families, law enforcement personnel and first re-sponders, and the entire community to-night. Let’s enact real solutions. They might prevent further acts of senseless violence. To the millions of Americans who agree with Ella, I hope you are watch-ing the Senate today. I thank Ella for reminding us all that we cannot stand idly by, wait for the next tragedy, and simply offer our thoughts and prayers. Now is the time Congress has to act to pass commonsense measures that have languished for too long and could save American lives. I support the amendments offered by Senator FEIN-
STEIN and Senator M URPHY . I hope my fellow Senators will do the same. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Maryland. Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, we are now debating the Commerce-Jus-tice-Science appropriations bill. I am the vice chair of that subcommittee and just wanted to make people aware that the pending bill funds the Depart-ment of Commerce—which hopefully works to create jobs in our country— the Justice Department, the National Science Foundation, the space agency, all related to how we build a strong economy and how we protect our peo-ple. It is a bill that I have worked on not only all year long, but I have worked on this bill for close to 30 years. When this subcommittee bill moves, it will be the final subcommittee in which I will have been in a major chairman-ship, vice-chairmanship role. So people would think: Gee, Senator Barb wants to move this major bill along. I sure do. I have worked hands- on with my colleague, the Senator from Alabama, Mr. S
HELBY . We have a good bill. We have a bill for which I will continue to advocate.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4337 June 20, 2016 
But people say: Well then, Barb, why would you support a filibuster? I will tell you why I supported a filibuster: guns, guns, guns, guns. And on the an-niversary of the assassination of those people at the Charleston church, we had yet another mass murder scene occur in Orlando, FL. We organized the filibuster so that we could get a vote to stop the ter-rorist suspects from getting guns and also to extend background checks for all gun sales and to extend those back-ground checks to the Internet and gun shows so that we could curb violence. I actually wanted to go further. I wanted to bring back the ban on as-sault weapons that expired because an assault weapon is no more than a weap-on of war to be used by the military or those in defense of our country who have to kill a lot of people in a short amount of time with as few trigger pulls as possible. But, no, we couldn’t get that, so we went to these two bills—one to close the terrorist loop-hole and the other to extend back-ground checks. I supported the men of Newtown. I see one Senator on the floor now, the distinguished Senator from Con-necticut, a former attorney general who was in the Senate when Newtown happened, along with his junior col-league, Senator C
HRIS MURPHY also of Connecticut, and Senator B
OOKER of New Jersey. They led this fight. I am proud of what they did be-cause—what did they filibuster for? Only to get a vote. We had to have a filibuster to get a vote on offering ideas on how we could curb gun vio-lence in our country and protect our own people. One is against terrorists getting guns, and the other is extend-ing background checks to the Internet sales and to gun show sales. I come from a State with a proud heritage of hunting. In many parts of our State, it is part of our way of life. We respect that, and this will in no way impede anybody from being able to do that. Yet we had to filibuster to get a vote—not even a filibuster on the bill. In just a matter of 2 hours from now, we will be voting on those two amendments. I hope those amendments pass. The other side of the aisle also has alternatives to those. That is the American way. We presented an idea, and they think they have an idea. But let’s vote on who has the best idea to curb violence and protect us against terrorism. This isn’t the first time someone filled with hate and armed with a high- powered weapon has killed his fellow citizens. Time and again, innocent Americans have died—in a church in Charleston, in schools such as New-town, in a movie theater, or at work. The list goes on. Also, the availability of guns occurs in our cities—in places such as Balti-more where we have a high homicide rate due to the drug trade. We would like to be able to address that today, but instead we have focused on these two specific things. As I said, I would like to have done more, but this is a fantastic start. I salute those col-leagues who led the filibuster. America wants us to take action. Let’s go to closing the terrorist loop-hole. When I get on an airplane, I go through a metal detector, I take my shoes off, and I take my jacket off. There was a time when they even looked at what I had in my tube of lip-stick so that it would not be a lethal weapon. I support that. I don’t want to be blown up in the sky, and I don’t want anybody else on that plane to be ei-ther. But why is it we would go through such incredible scrutiny to board an airplane to protect us against terrorists, yet we have no scrutiny of the people on a terrorist watch list to be able to buy a gun. You can be on a terrorist watch list, but one of the ways you are going to commit terror is to kill people—one through mass murder like the horrific 9/11 event that still sears our memory and breaks our heart every time we think about it. But, my gosh, if I am going to get on an airplane and they are going to want to know what is in my tube of lipstick when I go through—that it is not a lethal weap-on—certainly, why don’t we try to curb lethal weapons? That is why I support the Feinstein amendment. You could walk into a gun store now, and in 3 days or less you can walk out with a high-powered rifle, a high-capacity magazine, unless you have committed a crime. You cannot get on an airplane, but you can buy an AR–15. This is unbeliev-able, and this is what Senator F
EIN-
STEIN ’s amendment would fix. I am proud to be a cosponsor of her amend-ment. I am pleased the Senate will vote on it, and I hope we can pass it. The distinguished Senator from Texas, Mr. C
ORNYN , has an alternative. Let him explain it and defend it. I think the Feinstein amendment is su-perior. I also hope we pass the Murphy amendment to close the gun show loop-hole. Today 40 percent of gun sales are unlicensed. They are sold online or at gun shows. It means that 40 percent of the gun sales have no background check, giving felons, domestic-violence abusers, or terrorists easy access to guns. This amendment will help with two things: It will get all of the names of all people prohibited from buying guns into the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, which is the Federal background check system run by the FBI, and it will require background checks for the sale or transfer of all firearms by private sell-ers. Background checks do work. In 18 States where background checks are required for all handgun sales, 46 per-cent fewer women are killed by domes-tic partners and 48 percent fewer law enforcement officers are killed with handguns. So if you want to protect law en-forcement, if you want to protect us from domestic violence abusers, you want to close this gun show loophole. It will not only deal with terrorists, but it will deal with people who are deeply, deeply troubled. I urge my colleagues to pass the Mur-phy-Blumenthal amendment. Before I leave the floor, I wish to say something to the Senator from Con-necticut. After Newtown, I really thought we would do something. After the massacre of 20 children and 6 edu-cators who literally put themselves in harm’s way to save the children—6 edu-cators, 20 children, killed by an assault weapon—I thought we would do some-thing. If we didn’t do it after Newtown, I didn’t know when we would do it. Then there was Aurora, there was Charles-ton, and now there is Orlando. But we didn’t do it after Newtown. I really hope this is a new day. I thank the Senator for standing up for those families and for all in this coun-try. I am honored and pleased to stand with him. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from New Hampshire. Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I rise today to say to my colleagues who are here that I hope that we can stop the politics and really focus on a result that will make a difference for the American people. All of our hearts were broken across this country as we woke up the Sunday before last to the news of the horrific terrorist attack on the nightclub in Or-lando that took the lives of 49 innocent people, and 53 more were injured. I can’t imagine how their families feel and the pain their loved ones must be experiencing. Our prayers are with them and those who were wounded and with our brave first responders who had to go there to address this horrible ter-rorist attack. This was an attack that shook our Nation. It was an attack on our LGBT community in a place where people come together to enjoy themselves to celebrate who they are. It was an act of terrorism; it was an act of hatred. This was the worst terrorist attack on our soil since September 11. It is a somber reminder—unfortu-nately, the terrorist who committed this attack, someone who pledged alle-giance to the leader of ISIS, someone who, unfortunately, committed an act of terrorism and an act of hatred—that ISIS continues to plan and inspire at-tacks against us here at home and that we do have to take this fight to ISIS much more aggressively and make sure that they don’t continue to have the capacity to inspire terrorist attacks against us on our homeland or against our allies around the world, as we have seen in other places such as Paris and Brussels. We have to defeat radical Islamic ter-rorists, and we have to destroy ISIS so

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES4338 June 20, 2016 
they can no longer spread hatred, vio-lence, and death. Unfortunately, the terrorist who committed this horrible attack in Or-lando was investigated by our FBI. During that investigation, he was placed on what is called the selectee list. That list is part of a larger list sometimes referred to as the terrorist watch list. When an individual goes to purchase a firearm and they are on the terrorist watch list, the FBI is notified that purchase is taking place. They have up to 72 hours to take some ac-tion or to further their investigation. This individual, this horrible terrorist was taken off the list because the FBI had closed its investigation. So I hope we do not lose sight on this floor of the fact that we better do ev-erything we can to understand any gaps that exist in our intelligence sys-tem regarding that investigation, un-derstand why it was closed, and make sure investigations like this don’t get closed in the future. We must have a situation where the FBI has the re-sources and tools it needs to follow up properly when they have someone in their sights the way they had with this terrorist. The reality is, had he been on the list, as he had been previously be-fore the investigation was closed, the FBI would have been notified of his firearm purchase. On the floor today, we have proposals to address whether terrorists should be allowed to purchase guns. Make no mistake, Mr. President, gun control won’t stop terrorism. However, I think we can all agree that we do not want terrorists to purchase firearms. With both these competing proposals on the floor, we do have some common ground: that terrorists should not be permitted to purchase firearms. Unfor-tunately, where we find ourselves is playing our typical political football. I believe we should stop playing political football with something so important. As a member of the Committee on Armed Services, I am going to recom-mit myself—and I hope everyone in this body will—to doing everything I can to defeat ISIS. I also believe we should recommit ourselves to finding out if there are gaps in our intelligence system that need to be addressed and understanding why this investigation was closed. We must also make sure the FBI has the tools it needs to pre-vent these attacks. I also believe we should work to-gether to ensure that terrorists are not allowed to buy firearms. But we know what is going to happen. We will not find a solution by sticking to two measures that failed before, mostly on party lines. So I have been working with Senator C
OLLINS , Senator F LAKE , and Senator G
RAHAM , and talking to people on both sides of the aisle about coming together with a compromise that can pass this body and make sure terrorists are not allowed to buy guns. If you are too dangerous to board a commercial plane, it stands to reason you should not be able to buy a gun. It is as simple as that. And I think people on both sides of the aisle agree on that in principle. So why can’t we act in good faith and figure out the best way to achieve that goal? This is a gravely serious issue that requires a serious re-sponse. There is a solution here, and I am committed to finding it, but to find that solution, we have to come to-gether. Instead of having competing pro-posals that have already mostly failed in this Chamber when we took those votes back in December, let’s put aside the gamesmanship and come together to get a proposal that will be effective and get a result for the American peo-ple. The Senate will be considering two proposals, as I referenced. Both have failed, mostly on party lines. By all ac-counts, these proposals are likely to fail again and we will then be right back where we started—no safer, no smarter, no more successful in pro-tecting our citizens. There will be more political blame, but we will be no clos-er to a solution, to a result on some-thing that matters, that means we will move forward in ensuring that terror-ists do not have access to firearms. I am here to talk about a better way. During the past week, in working with Senators COLLINS , FLAKE , GRAHAM , and others and reaching out to my col-leagues on the other side of the aisle, we want to propose legislation that may actually pass the Senate. To get to that solution, we have to move this debate forward. That is why I will be voting today to advance both options before us in order to provide an oppor-tunity for us to come together with a bipartisan compromise that will get a result for the American people. There is an opportunity in this de-bate to go forward and to get a result. Unfortunately, both bills on the floor aren’t the answer. We know that. They both failed before. So I will be con-tinuing to push to get a result. What we are doing this afternoon in this political exercise is pushing for legislation that both sides know is going to fail. Both options before us— that of Senator F
EINSTEIN and Senator C
ORNYN —are well-intentioned, but each has flaws that I am concerned about. Senator F
EINSTEIN ’s approach is very broad, and it would include the entire terrorism database. It could include in-stances where there has only been a de-rogatory allegation made about an American which has not been vali-dated. There are real due process ques-tions about that, using the broader list. It is much broader than the phrase ‘‘no fly, no buy.’’ I think we all under-stand that—no fly, no buy. But this is much broader, and it is misleading to call the Feinstein proposal that pro-posal. If you cannot get on a plane, you shouldn’t be able to buy a firearm, but this measure doesn’t require the gov-ernment show anything other than a reasonable belief that you have been engaged in conduct relating to ter-rorism, and it doesn’t necessarily mean it has been validated. In December, I supported Senator CORNYN ’s legislation because it was similar to Senator F
EINSTEIN ’s legisla-tion but it had additional, stronger due process protections. However, Senator C
ORNYN ’s legislation requires the FBI to act in 72 hours, to go to a court in 72 hours to present probable cause. Having been a former murder pros-ecutor, I am concerned that is not enough time under these circumstances to take proper action and to be able to mount all of that before a court to meet a probable cause standard. So I think there are some concerns that I have in terms of the timing with Sen-ator C
ORNYN ’s legislation and also the fact that if you had probable cause, you probably would have already charged someone with a crime. There is a better way. These two pieces of legislation that I will be mov-ing forward in this debate are a start, but they are not the end. They are not an end until we get a commonsense re-sult that ensures that terrorists can’t buy guns and that we protect the due process rights of American citizens. So our proposal is one that would ensure that if you are on the no-fly list— which, by the way, roughly 800 Ameri-cans are on the no-fly list—that would ensure you could not go and purchase a firearm. But if you believe you are being wrongfully denied your right, you can challenge that in court. If the government is wrong, then they are going to have to pay your costs and at-torney fees. Our legislation would also ensure that individuals like the horrible ter-rorist who committed these attacks in Orlando and who are on a smaller sublist called the selectee list, which is a list that is smaller than the overall terrorist watch list—there must be rea-sonable suspicion that an individual meets additional heightened criteria, where they have additional derogatory information above and beyond the cri-teria required for the broader database that someone is engaged in terrorism. The Orlando terrorist who committed these horrific attacks was on this list. That group of individuals would not be permitted to purchase a firearm, but they, too, would have the opportunity to go to court and to challenge that de-cision and, if the government is wrong, to make sure their costs are paid for. Our proposal would also ensure that if you have been on this list for the last 5 years, the FBI would be notified if you went to purchase a firearm. Why is that important? Because unfortunately the terrorist who committed these hor-rible attacks was taken off the list. We better find out why that happened. But we will make sure, in this legislation, that if you were on the list and you go to purchase a firearm, that at least the FBI is notified so they can follow up. If they want to conduct additional inves-tigation and surveillance—like I hope they would have done in this instance had they learned about this indi-vidual—they have the opportunity to do that.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4339 June 20, 2016 
We believe this is a fair, workable so-lution. It is a solution that makes sense. It is a solution when we think about the overall terror database, which has about 1 million people on it. The no-fly list has about 800 Americans on it. If you combine the selectee list and the no-fly list, we are talking about fewer than 2,500 Americans. If you are on that list and you are being focused on in an open investigation by the FBI, with the belief you are en-gaged in terrorism or engaged with ter-rorists, then you should not be able to buy a firearm. We have a responsibility to protect peoples’ constitutional rights. We need to make sure there is due process for anything we do here. That is our basic responsibility. That is why our legisla-tion makes sure terrorists can’t buy guns, and it also makes sure the due process rights of Americans are pro-tected. If the government is wrong, their costs and attorney’s fees will be paid for because the government should have that burden. I suspect these two proposals may fail tonight—not because of anything I will do, because I am going to be ask-ing to get to this debate. I want a re-sult. I think we should stop playing po-litical football with this. If these two proposals fail tonight—which, unfortu-nately, I think is likely to happen since it is almost Groundhog Day again, since they are similar to two proposals we voted on in December, and we know what the result of that was: They both failed—I hope we can come together. I have talked about a good-faith, workable solution tonight that makes sense. I hope that on both sides of the aisle we can work together to get a re-sult for the American people. We need to make sure we get something done and ensure terrorists cannot purchase firearms. But let’s also make sure we continue to go after ISIS and defeat ISIS so they cannot inspire further at-tacks like this on our country. Let’s also make sure that if there are gaps in our intelligence system—because the FBI didn’t follow up or should have fol-lowed up or they need more resources to follow these cases to their end—that we work together to address that as well because this was a horrific act of terrorism, and we need to treat it ac-cordingly. It is my hope that we can work to-gether on bipartisan solutions that will help keep the American people safe. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Connecticut is recognized. Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I am pleased to follow my colleague and friend from New Hampshire, who served as attorney general of her State during part of the time that I served as attorney general in the State of Con-necticut. We have in this body common ground in seeking more effective law enforcement solutions to all of the harm and unspeakable violence that has so plagued our Nation in recent years. But I cannot help but remark that we would not be having this de-bate but for an effort last week—in fact, a filibuster—that took the floor under the leadership of my great col-league and friend Senator M
URPHY , supported by Senator B
OOKER and my-self and then by tens of other Senators, to make sure that we debate and that we vote. Our feeling was that there should be no business as usual on this appropriations bill—as important as it might be—in the wake of the terrorist extremist harm in Orlando. We demanded action because Amer-ica is demanding action. We have been deluged before today, and I am sure that we will be deluged after, by Amer-icans saying that the time has come for commonsense measures to stop gun violence inspired by ISIS or other ter-rorist extremists abroad and supported by them, as well as the homegrown ter-rorists and the lone wolf. During the 15 hours that we were on the floor, our offices were deluged by encouragement and support from Con-necticut and from all around the coun-try, joining us in saying: Enough is enough; the time for action is now. These were letters, tweets, Facebook posts, demonstrations, rallies, and other insistent cries for Congress to do its job and respond to this public health crisis, much as we would to any other epidemic. It is an epidemic that we face—an epidemic of gun violence. In Connecticut, we have a special un-derstanding with the people of Orlando about what it is like to have a commu-nity go through such a horrible trag-edy. We sought action in the wake of Newtown some years ago, and I am often asked: What now has changed since Newtown? What will make the difference? The reason I think we have reached a tipping point and why I think there has been a sea change and a critically important change in the dynamic here in the Senate is that we now know that these endless progres-sions of massacres, gang violence, do-mestic violence, and other gun crimes at every level will continue and, in-deed, will rise in number and severity unless we act and, equally, if not more importantly, that the link to terrorist extremists abroad has become irre-trievable. We know violent terrorists at home, inspired and supported by ISIS abroad, will continue to wreak havoc and take lives. They will con-tinue to use AR–15s and semi-auto-matic assault weapons, which have been designed to kill and maim as many people as possible, as quickly as possible. We have become much better at stop-ping terrorists from carrying bombs onto planes because we adopted a no- fly list, and we have a terrorist watch list. Those AR–15s and other military- style assault weapons have now become the weapon of choice, rather than ex-plosives. The form no longer preferred by terrorists is a plane. Now it is a nightclub, an office, a school, a church, or wherever people gather. There is no question that we need to take the fight to ISIS, as my colleague from New Hampshire has said, and it needs to be taken to ISIS more aggressively and effectively. But the Nation also needs to harden its defenses at home and to use information and intelligence that comes to us about people who are pre-paring, undertaking, or engaging ac-tively in terrorist activity—as evi-denced by fact, not mere speculation— and make sure that we are protected from them by stopping them from buy-ing guns. With weapons that can be easily and legally purchased, one or two gunmen can wreak unimaginable havoc, killing and injuring hundreds of people in a matter of minutes. They need to be barred from buying guns. That is why I am supporting, strongly and enthusiastically, the proposal made by my colleague, Senator F
EIN-
STEIN , that embodies the basic prin-ciple: no fly, no gun. If you are too dan-gerous to be permitted on a plane, you should be deemed too dangerous to buy a gun. That is in no way to interfere with anybody’s Second Amendment rights. I believe in the Second Amend-ment. It is the law of the land. There should be due process, as well, for any-body who is erroneously on any list. The Feinstein proposal, which I am pleased to cosponsor, would give the Attorney General of the United States the flexible authority to stop people who are on a compilation of lists—no fly, terrorist watch lists—or under in-vestigation by the FBI 5 years pre-viously from buying a gun. That is the basic principle that is at stake. It of-fers a strong hope. Indeed, it might well have prevented the shooter in Or-lando from buying a gun, because he had been under investigation by the FBI in the previous 5 years. These measures are necessary to pro-tect America. The alternative, the pro-posal made by Senator C
ORNYN , I be-lieve is unworkable and ineffective. The government has to meet a probable cause standard and prove in a public proceeding, a trial, that standard is met. If an individual can be proved by probable cause to be sufficiently dan-gerous to be barred from a gun pur-chase, that person can be arrested. The Cornyn proposal, in effect, makes it more difficult to stop someone from buying a gun than to arrest them. So it seems to be that in most circumstances it would be ineffective—indeed, mean-ingless. To put it simply, the Cornyn amendment essentially adds nothing to the tools law enforcement already have. I have heard it described as a wolf in sheep’s clothing. In my view, it is actually a sheep in wolf’s clothing, with the pretense of being strong and effective in the fight of terrorism but in fact much less than meets the eye. Folks in law enforcement will know that investigations and analyses con-cerning highly complex and sensitive information that has to do with ter-rorism sometimes take time, and the 72-hour requirement placed an unreal-istic and unworkable limit on the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES4340 June 20, 2016 
United States. I want to emphasize again that none of this is to say that due process is to be deemed unimpor-tant. In fact, anyone erroneously on this list ought to be provided with ef-fective and speedy due process, which is what the Feinstein amendment does. We are also going to be voting on an-other pair of amendments addressed at the broader background check issue. I urge my colleagues to support the measure that I have led with my col-leagues, Senator M
URPHY , Senator S
CHUMER , and Senator B OOKER , which ensures that our background system works in the only rational way it should—by requiring everyone pur-chasing a firearm to undergo a back-ground check. That background check process is necessary for any terrorist list to be effectively implemented, be-cause otherwise there would be no way of knowing whether someone is on such a list. ‘‘No fly, no gun’’ is effective only if there is a list that can be enforced by review of background. These measures are supported by 90 percent of the American people or more. Everywhere I went over the weekend in Con-necticut—Boys State convention spon-sored by the American Legion in Winstead, the Branford Road Race for Father’s Day, yesterday, the blessing of the fleet in Southport—Americans and the people of Connecticut have shown us that we must act. This Cham-ber is the place where there are speech-es. It is often filled with words. Now is the time for action. An alternative to the Murphy-Schu-mer-Blumenthal-Booker amendment has been offered by Senator G
RASSLEY . Unfortunately, it would not only fail to fix the problem, but, in fact, it would worsen the status quo. It makes broad sweeping changes to portions of our gun laws that now prevent people with dangerous mental illnesses from ob-taining weapons. This proposal would make an abrupt sweeping change to the definition that could result in many in-dividuals currently prohibited from purchasing firearms suddenly being able to do so, even if they do in fact have conditions that make them dan-gerous to themselves or others. There is no single solution to the problem of extremist terrorism in-spired or supported by ISIS or enemies abroad. We need to be mindful and ag-gressive and effective in countering. The link to terrorism abroad is undeni-ably seen at home. I want to commit that today is in a sense the beginning of a new chapter, when perhaps we can seek common ground in light of the sea change and the tipping point we have reached in this Nation. We can seek common ground on measures that are realistic. My quarrel with the Collins amendment is that it would, in fact, fail to cover 90 percent of the suspected terrorists who pose danger, and it would not have stopped the shooter in Orlando, as the Feinstein proposal might well have done. There is a basis for common ground. I am committed to seek it. We have not only the opportunity but the obliga-tion to do more and to do it better. This effort will not be a sprint, as I said literally within days of the New-town tragedy. It is an effort that re-quires continued work to stop assault weapons and AR–15s, which are weap-ons of war and mass destruction, to prevent illegal trafficking and straw purchases, to enact a mental health initiative and school safety measures, to prevent domestic violence from ca-reening into gun violence, and to pre-vent the continued broad immunity unique to the gun industry under PLCAA. These steps will come in time because the American people are say-ing, as we said last week on the floor of the Senate: Enough is enough. The time is now for action. I thank my colleagues for supporting this ef-fort and for their continuing support and, most importantly, the people of Connecticut who have been so generous and caring and most important for the survivors and victims who have shared their stories again and again. The face and voice of Newtown has been here through groups such as Sandy Hook Promise and Newtown Action Alliance. In the end, citizen activism will enable us to do more and do better to counter extremist violence and gun violence throughout America. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. ERNST ). The Senator from Texas. Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, be-fore I yield to the Senator from Cali-fornia, I ask unanimous consent that she be recognized for up to 20 minutes, and following that, that I be recognized for my remarks. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, re-serving the right to object, may I ask for 10 minutes after my colleagues have spoken? The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator modify his request? Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I am not sure I understood it. If it is 10 minutes after I conclude my remarks, then I have no objection to that. Mrs. BOXER. Yes. Mrs. FEINSTEIN. If I may, Madam President, I thought what the Senator was proposing was that he would have 20 minutes and I would have 20 min-utes. Mr. CORNYN. Right. Mrs. BOXER. That is fine. Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I will go first, and then he is going to do his 20 minutes, and then Mrs. B
OXER will speak. Mrs. BOXER. That is exactly what I asked. Mr. CORNYN. I have no objection to that. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modified request? Mr. CORNYN. No objection. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I appreciate the Senator from Texas. 
AMENDMENT NO . 4720 
Madam President, I rise to speak in support of the amendment to keep guns out of the hands of known or suspected terrorists. The Orlando attack again exposed a dangerous loophole in our law that allows known or suspected terrorists to legally purchase guns through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, known as NICS. We call this loophole the terror gap. Let me explain what that means. There are currently 10 categories of people who are blocked from buying guns through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, known as NICS, and here they are. They include felons, those under felony indictment, fugitives from justice, drug users or addicts, those committed to mental institutions or adjudicated as mentally defective, foreign nation-als here unlawfully or those with non-immigrant visas, such as temporary workers, those dishonorably discharged from the military, and those with a do-mestic violence restraining order. But one group that cannot be blocked from buying guns are those who are known or suspected terrorists on the FBI’s consolidated terrorist watch list. They can buy guns, but certain aliens can’t, dishonorably discharged can’t, people of renounced citizenship can’t, drug users can’t, fugitives from justice, felons, et cetera, are the ones who can-not. We know that individuals on the watch list have exploited this loophole. According to FBI data, over the past 11 years, the success rate for known or suspected terrorists who undergo back-ground checks to buy guns is 91 per-cent. So 91 percent of over 2,000 gun buyers were found by a GAO study to be able to purchase guns. Closing this dangerous loophole was first proposed by the Bush Justice Department in 2007. In fact, we derived the language in our amendment from that original bill. Our amendment would give the At-torney General the authority to block a gun sale to known or suspected ter-rorists. It also provides an appeals process, both administrative and judi-cial. Let me read that language be-cause it is derived out of the 2007 Bush Justice Department. ‘‘The Attorney General may deny the transfer of [a] firearm if the Attorney General determines, based on the total-ity of circumstances, that the trans-feree represents a threat to public safe-ty based on a reasonable suspicion that the transferee is engaged, or has been engaged, in conduct constituting, in preparation for, in aid of, or related to terrorism, or providing material sup-port or resources therefor.’’ That is from that bill. In order to ensure that FBI would be alerted in the case of an individual such as Omar Mateen, our amendment also includes language proposed by Senators LEAHY and N ELSON . This lan-guage would ensure that any suspected terrorist who tries to buy a gun within 5 years of being investigated for ter-rorism crimes would automatically trigger a notification to the Justice Department about the attempted pur-chase.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4341 June 20, 2016 
As you know, in 2013 and 2014, the FBI conducted two inquiries on the Or-lando gunman related to suspected ter-rorism. Even though the FBI was in-vestigating him for possible terrorism, and at one point placed him on the FBI’s terrorist watch list, it had no power to prevent him from purchasing weapons at a gun store. That is the key issue. It had no power to prevent him from purchasing a gun at a gun store. Had this amendment been in place, it would have allowed the Attorney General to know about the Orlando shooter’s attempt to buy a Sig Sauer MCX assault rifle, and then investigate to determine whether to deny the gun based off this man’s en-tire history. Let me now explain how the terrorist screening database, also known as the consolidated terrorist watch list, works. Under this amendment, the At-torney General would look to this database to identify a known or sus-pected terrorist. To be included in this database, the FBI must have a reason-able suspicion—based on a totality of circumstances and objective facts— that a person is a known or suspected terrorist. Information is derived from intelligence and law enforcement sources at home and abroad. To ensure that only individuals who pose a threat to national security are placed on this list, FBI Director Comey told the Intel-ligence Committee in February that information is thoroughly vetted. The FBI’s process is also rigorously audited to reduce the number of false positives. There are approximately 1 million records in this database, but less than one-half of 1 percent are U.S. persons. This is the net. This is the terrorist screening database. This is the product of intelligence and law enforcement. It is scrutinized, and if it is worthy, it is placed on this database—1 million records maintained by the FBI’s Ter-rorist Screening Center, fewer than 5,000 U.S. persons. That is one-half of 1 percent. This is a targeted list that is care-fully put together. It is focused on known or suspected terrorists believed to represent a risk to public safety. One thing I want to say, and I will re-peat this when I discuss Senator C
OL-
LINS’ bill, but many people confuse this list with the no-fly list. The no-fly list is this dark blue center. It is 81,000 records. It is maintained by the FBI’s Terrorist Screening Center, and it has fewer than 1,000 persons. Then there is the selectee list. It is even smaller. It is 28,000 records main-tained by the FBI’s Terrorist Screening Center—fewer than 1,700 U.S. persons. But you can see, if you are going to have a net, the net has to be big enough. I am going to explain to you why in a moment. Our amendment also includes due process protections. It allows an indi-vidual who believes they were mistak-enly denied a gun to learn the reason for the denial and appeal that decision, both administratively with the Justice Department and judicially. This is the same appeals process currently in place for anyone who believes they are wrongly denied a gun through the NICS database, which I just went through a few minutes ago. Let me speak about two Republican proposals, why I think they wouldn’t work. I am delighted the Senator from Texas is on the floor. We both sit on the Judiciary Committee. I have had the pleasure of working with him for a number of years. But his amendment requires the probable cause standard to be met. That is a very high standard because if that standard is met, there is already enough evidence to arrest the person, search their home and car, seize their property, and indict the per-son. It is not a practical standard to block a gun purchase. It would just be an in-finitesimal part of what is actually out there. The proposal also says that somebody should be entitled to a full- blown contested hearing with counsel, but if this hearing is not completed within 72 hours, the gun sale goes through. The hearing would require the filing of an emergency petition, the service of process, the opportunity for the individual to get a lawyer, and then the actual full-blown hearing. This is nearly impossible to achieve within 72 hours, and if it isn’t achieved, the terrorist gets the gun. Senator COLLINS has also circulated alternative language. I consider myself a friend of hers. I have great respect for her. We serve on the Intelligence Com-mittee together. But my view is that her alternative is not enough to close the loophole that creates this terror gap and allows terrorists to buy guns. This alternative would focus on nar-row parts of the database. This no-fly list—you can see how small it is—and the selectee list, which is here—the se-lectee list includes those persons who can fly but who receive additional screening before boarding a plane. Focusing so narrowly on these two smaller lists is not enough, and I would like to tell you why. It would leave out a huge number of known or suspected terrorists—one, as you can see. I have gone through that. I have gone through the no-fly list. If we were to focus only on the no-fly list and the selectee list, we would be leaving out 891,000 foreign nationals—names given to us by law enforcement, intelligence sources, both here and among our allies—who are on the terrorist watch list and approxi-mately 2,300 U.S. persons determined by the FBI to be known or suspected terrorists. Focusing on the smaller lists leaves out close to 90 percent of known or suspected terrorists, covering both U.S. persons and foreigners. I remind my colleagues, you don’t need to be a U.S. person to legally buy guns in this country. That makes it important to understand how this list is larger. Let me give you an example. Travelers using the Visa Waiver Pro-gram can legally buy guns. There are 20 million travelers in that program annually, and more than 100,000 of them don’t go home when they should. Now I would like to share one exam-ple where a known or suspected ter-rorist was on the FBI’s radar but likely had not been placed on the no-fly list. Over the weekend, my staff went through 86 cases and pulled out some of them. I have them here, and at this time I would like to mention one. Nader Saadeh, a U.S. citizen, was radicalized and became a devoted fol-lower of ISIL. The FBI received a crit-ical tip about Saadeh in April of 2015. The tip included a detailed account of his radicalization and support of ISIL. This is all available in a 13-page crimi-nal complaint. In May, Saadeh flew from New York City to Jordan. He was detained and later arrested by the FBI. Here is someone who clearly met the definition of a known or suspected ter-rorist but was permitted to fly out of a major U.S. airport in the city where the 9/11 attacks occurred. This shows the danger of focusing only on narrow subsets of the terrorist watch list. To me, that just doesn’t make sense. There is broad support for our amendment, including more than 260 organizations and community leaders around the country. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the list be added to the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD directly fol-lowing my remarks. The Justice Department and the White House support this amendment. They believe it is a workable approach to help prevent terrorists from obtain-ing weapons. We worked with the Jus-tice Department, and the Justice De-partment made some additions to our amendment. They released a statement of support. I will read it in part: ‘‘This amendment gives the Justice Depart-ment an important additional tool to prevent the sale of guns to suspected terrorists by licensed firearms dealers while ensuring protection of the de-partment’s operational and investiga-tive sensitivities.’’ Thirty-eight Senators have cospon-sored the amendment, including Re-publican Senator M
ARK KIRK, making it bipartisan. Closing the terror loophole gap is an important step, but it isn’t enough. Let me explain why. Today, you can buy a gun at a gun show without a back-ground check. As a matter of fact, my chief of staff, a woman, was pursued at a gun show to buy a .50-caliber rifle, which is a sniper rifle from which a bullet can travel for a mile and still go through a brick wall. You can buy a gun on the Internet without a back-ground check. You can buy a gun on the private market without a back-ground check. That is why we must pass the amendment offered by Sen-ators M
URPHY , SCHUMER , BOOKER , and B
LUMENTHAL . This would ensure that guns sold at gun shows, over the Inter-net, and from person to person are sub-ject to background checks. If we don’t also make that change, known or sus-pected terrorists will still be able to

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES4342 June 20, 2016 
buy guns at gun shows with no ques-tions asked. Now, with ISIL intent on perpe-trating and inspiring attacks in this country, there is an increased urgency to make it harder for terrorists to get their hands on guns. To me, this isn’t a gun control issue. It is really a na-tional security issue. If there is any doubt about that, let me briefly share a portion of CIA Director John Bren-nan’s remarks from last week’s open hearing of the Senate Intelligence Committee. He said: 
We judge that ISIL is training and at-tempting to deploy operatives for further at-tacks. ISIL has a large cadre of Western fighters who could potentially serve as operatives for attacks in the West. The group is probably exploring a variety of means for infiltrating operatives into the West, including refugee flows, smuggling routes, and legitimate methods of travel. Further, as we have seen in Orlando, San Bernardino, and elsewhere, ISIL is attempt-ing to inspire attacks by sympathizers who have no direct links to the group. Last month for example, a senior ISIL figure pub-licly urged the group’s followers to conduct attacks in their home countries if they were unable to travel to Syria and Iraq. 
Those are the words of the head of the world’s most prominent intel-ligence agency. We should heed those words. We know ISIL adherents and sympathizers are already inside the United States. In fact, since March of 2014, Federal prosecutors have charged 86 men and women around the country in connection with the Islamic State, and 36 have been convicted. We also know that terrorists are well aware just how weak our gun laws are and that they urge their followers to ex-ploit them. In 2011, a man by the name of Adam Gadahn, an Al Qaeda spokesman—he is actually an American who went to Syria and was a suicide bomber—urged terrorists to take advantage of our weak gun laws. Gadahn stated on the Internet: ‘‘America is absolutely awash with easily obtainable firearms.’’ This bears repeating. Terrorist groups—like Al Qaeda, ISIL, al-Nusra, and others—know that our gun laws are weak and can be exploited. We can’t continue to do nothing in the face of such potential death and po-tential devastation. I have been fight-ing to reduce gun violence throughout my career, since my days as a county supervisor and as mayor of San Fran-cisco. I know how difficult it is to make changes because the opposition is so extreme and opposes any measure to curtail gun violence—no matter what it is. It was against all odds that the assault weapons legislation passed in 1994, and the gun lobby fought hard not only to defeat the amendment, which succeeded, but to defeat those in the House who supported it, and that start-ed its own reign of terror. When the Brady background check passed in 1993, multiple cloture mo-tions on the bill failed before it ulti-mately passed with 63 votes, but that bill did not cover sales at gun shows, private sales, or Internet sales, which have increased significantly. After the Newtown shooting, I thought we would do something to stem the tide of these weapons. We tried. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator’s time has expired. Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I am just about finished. I ask unani-mous consent for an additional minute. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, we tried to renew the ban on assault weapons, but that failed. We tried to expand the background check, even through a compromise offered by Sen-ator MANCHIN , but that effort failed. I remember that when the vote on the background check failed, the New York Daily News put the photos of the New-town victims on the front cover. There were 20 young children, ages 6 and 7, and their educators, and the headline read: ‘‘For Shame.’’ It is time for us to stand up. It is time to force elected representatives to take action. We must expand back-ground checks. We must make sure that the government can stop a gun from being sold to a known or sus-pected terrorist, and that is not too much to ask. I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor. There being no objection, the mate-rial was ordered to be printed in the R

AMENDMENT NO . 4749 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, as to the two main amendments that we will hear about tonight regarding the no-fly list, the watch list, or the known suspected terrorist list, we agree that terrorists should not have guns. Ter-rorists should not have guns. The only difference between the amendment of the Senator from California and my amendment is that once the gun pur-chase was stopped, under her amend-ment the bad guy walks away, and like the bombers who used the makeshift bomb in Massachusetts or some other device, they would be able to go buy guns illegally or create some other weapon of mass destruction and com-mit terrorist acts. My amendment would make sure that the law enforce-ment officials were notified on a time-ly basis, and then they would have up to 3 additional days to go to court and show probable cause to get a wiretap to listen to phone conversations, to exe-cute search warrants to get additional information, and then to go before a judge and not just to deny access to the firearm but to take the terrorists off the street. Actually, in many ways, the amendment of my friend from Cali-fornia would not be as tough on the terrorists as mine would be. We really should not be focusing on restricting the rights of law-abiding citizens under the Second Amendment without due process of law. That is what the Feinstein amendment does. We ought to be asking ourselves if there are those in this Chamber who believe you can deny American citizens their constitutional rights without due process of law based on a secret list that the government maintains. I don’t care who it is. Whether it is the Obama administration or the former Bush ad-ministration, I don’t think any Amer-ican should sacrifice their constitu-tional rights without forcing the gov-ernment to go to an impartial mag-istrate or judge and be able to show sufficient evidence to convince the judge that they have the evidence to deny those constitutional rights. This is really surreal to me. Our colleagues want to make this about gun control when what we should be making this about is the fight to eliminate the Islamic extremism that is the root cause for what happened in Orlando. My colleagues, in many ways, want to treat the symptoms without fighting the disease. There is abso-lutely nothing in the Feinstein amend-ment that would have prevented the Orlando shooting from occurring— nothing. Conversely, under my amendment, the FBI would be immediately notified of anybody who was or had been on a watch list during the preceding 5 years, and this would obviously escalate the investigation. The FBI could go to court, get a search warrant, get a wire-tap, after getting the appropriate waiv-ers, and get the sort of evidence nec-essary to detain or arrest, in other words, the terrorists rather than just deny them access to a firearm. If they are too dangerous to buy a firearm, they are too dangerous to be loose on our streets. The Boston Marathon bombers, which I mentioned a moment ago, the San Bernardino jihadists, and the ISIS- inspired radicals in Garland, TX, are all examples of the fact that Islamic extremists want the American people to trade our liberties and values for fear and panic. CIA Director John Brennan made it clear last week that this threat from ISIS, or the Islamic State, is not going away. He said that the President and just about every other member of the administration have refused to ac-knowledge that the administration’s efforts ‘‘have not reduced the group’s terrorism capability and global reach.’’ Each time an attack has happened, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to make this about their

gun control agenda. We can have that debate, but to act like this is a sub-stitute for dealing with the threat of ISIS, either abroad or here at home through radicalization of American citizens using social media and the Internet, is just a diversion. I think all we need to do is to look at what the administration decided on the 911 transcripts from Orlando. Origi-nally, they said they were going to re-dact those transcripts. Well, I am glad they had a chance to reconsider it be-cause this reveals what was going on in that nightclub in Orlando. This reveals what the motivation was of the shoot-er. This wasn’t just some street crime incident. This was a premeditated ter-rorist attack on American soil. Failing to release the complete 911 tapes would have been an affront not only to any promise of open government—and the administration said they were going to be the most open, transparent govern-ment in American history—but it would be an insult to the American people. You can’t redact away the hurt and pain that so many are feeling from the loss of loved ones or the loss of a sense of security. You can’t redact away the reality that a hate-filled kill-er pledged his allegiance to a terrorist organization before killing 49 Ameri-cans. I still believe one of the administra-tion’s goals is to avoid any discussion about their failed strategy to combat radical Islamic terrorism either abroad or here at home. Instead, they decided to pivot and limit Americans’ constitu-tional rights without due process of law. If they can do that to the Second Amendment, can they do it to the First Amendment? How about the Fourth or Fifth Amendment? How many more provisions of the Bill of Rights do our Democratic friends believe can be de-nied, absent due process of law or forc-ing the government to go in front of an impartial judge and actually producing some evidence? We are indeed facing a serious threat from radical terrorism, both overseas and at home, and if we can’t be honest and clear-eyed about who is attacking us, how in the world do we have any chance to defeat them? Because that needs to be our ultimate goal—to degrade and ultimately de-stroy ISIS. We all agree that terrorists should not be able to purchase a weapon. That is not up for debate, and anybody who suggests that it is, is simply mis-leading you. The question before us is whether we are going to do so in a way that is constitutional. The question be-fore us is, Are we going to do it in a way that would actually improve ter-rorist investigations or not? My amendment is called the SHIELD Act, and it would stop terrorists from buying guns while ensuring that law- abiding citizens placed on a watch list by mistake don’t have their rights taken away because of some secret list created by the Obama administration or by this government. And it will also—this is important—it will also set up a process to monitor, investigate, and detain terrorists where warranted by evidence. In that way, my proposal is far and away stronger than the pro-posal of the senior Senator from Cali-fornia for several reasons. First, her amendment is unconstitu-tional. Last week I mentioned the problems that the late Senator Teddy Kennedy had when his name came up on a watch list by mistake. He was de-nied a ticket at an airport on one of his trips between Washington and Boston. After realizing the problem, he had a lot of trouble getting it resolved. And you can bet, if Teddy Kennedy had trouble getting it resolved, what kind of a chance does an average American have? He said as much. He said: Now, if they have that kind of difficulty for a Member of Congress, how in the world are average Americans, getting caught up in this kind of thing, going to be able to get treated fairly and not have their rights abused? Senator Kennedy asked the question we all need to be asking right now. If a well-known, well-connected, and pow-erful public figure like Ted Kennedy had trouble getting his name removed from a watch list, do we have any con-fidence that average Americans won’t have their constitutional rights denied with no legal process to remedy it? Our friends across the aisle wouldn’t pro-vide due process for law-abiding citi-zens placed on a watch list by mistake, like the late Senator Kennedy, and mine would. Secondly, the Feinstein amendment has another fatal flaw. There are no ad-ditional tools for law enforcement to monitor, investigate, and detain sus-pected terrorists. My proposal not only stops them from buying a gun, it would take them off the streets. FBI Director Comey has testified be-fore the Senate that legislation that merely blocks a firearm transfer to a person on a watch list, without more, could actually disrupt a terrorism in-vestigation. That is because if we auto-matically block the transfer, then it would tip the suspected terrorists that law enforcement is watching them and building a case, and they would simply turn to some other weapon, either ille-gal or manufactured. This could have tragic consequences, as a terrorist could take immediate steps to speed up their attack, obtain illegal weapons, as I said, or bomb-making materials, all the while thwarting law enforcement surveillance. We need to be careful about enacting legislation that could, in the words of the FBI Director, effectively blow a terrorism investigation. No matter how well-intentioned, I believe that would be the effect of Senator F
EIN-
STEIN ’s amendment. The truth is, under that amendment a motivated terrorist could buy a gun, be denied, then walk out of the gun shop and find another avenue to carry out a terrorist attack. By letting a dangerous terrorist roam free on the streets, the proposal of our Democratic friends would make us less safe, not more. My legislation, in contrast, would not only block that person from buying a firearm because the FBI would be im-mediately notified and they wouldn’t be able to take it with them—they would have to wait at least 3 days while the FBI conducted an additional investigation—it would also allow the authorities the opportunity to carry out that investigation, followed by an expedited court hearing where a judge could block the sale and authorize the arrest of the terrorist if, in fact, there was some evidence to prove that was the case. If the judge deems there is probable cause to block the sale, the terrorist can be immediately detained by law enforcement. I repeat myself: If someone is dan-gerous enough not to own a firearm, aren’t they also dangerous enough to be taken off the streets? The amend-ment of the Senator from California would let the bad guy go. In this way, my proposal goes much further than our Democratic friends who have to do more to prevent terror-ists from buying guns, and we have to lock them up and stop them before they kill innocent Americans too. Importantly, my amendment would apply to anyone who was previously under an investigation for suspicion of terrorism within the last 5 years, like the Orlando attacker. The Orlando attacker wasn’t even on the watch list, so I don’t know what my friend from California is trying to propose here by saying that if you are on a watch list, you ought to be denied a gun. But I guess she is saying that even if you are not on a watch list, you ought to be de-nied a gun. We have said that if you have been on a watch list for the last 5 years, then the FBI would be provided notice. Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, will the Senator yield for just one for-ward comment? Our bill does the same thing. Mr. CORNYN. I will yield to the Sen-ator after my remarks. I am almost through. When similar proposals were offered in December, the amendment from the senior Senator from California didn’t even get a majority of votes in this body. My related proposal back in De-cember was bipartisan and garnered 55 votes. I am glad the junior Senator from In-diana and the junior Senator from West Virginia—both Democrats—sup-ported that bill then, and I hope they will do so again. Both made the deci-sion to do what was right instead of what was politically convenient. The due process clause of the U.S. Constitu-tion is more than just a convenience; it is, after all, our Constitution. Senators pledge to uphold and defend the Con-stitution of the United States, but then to vote for an amendment that would deny constitutional rights without due process of law—it sure seems inten-tioned with that oath.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4345 June 20, 2016 
We must advance commonsense legis-lation to defend ourselves against Is-lamic extremism, and I believe my amendment is a good place to start. It is not the only idea. The Senator from Maine, Ms. C
OLLINS , and the Sen-ator from Pennsylvania, Mr. T
OOMEY , have some interesting ideas that I know they would like to develop and have a chance perhaps to vote on, but in the meantime, we need to do more to equip the FBI with the law enforce-ment tools they need to gather infor-mation on terrorists so that we can lock them up, and we have to be able to collect the dots before we can connect the dots. I hope today my colleagues vote for my amendment. It blocks terrorists from buying guns, it detains terrorists if there is evidence to prove sufficient to satisfy a judge that they should be taken off the streets, and it upholds the Second Amendment to the Con-stitution of the United States. Again, the question before us couldn’t be clearer. We are going to vote on two proposals, both of which stop terrorists from buying guns. One is constitutional; one is not. I would strongly urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to support the one that is constitutional, and that would be the SHIELD Act, or the Cor-nyn amendment. I yield to the Senator for a question. Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, it is my belief that our amendment does cover the—Senator L
EAHY and Senator N
ELSON submitted to us an amendment, which is incorporated, which does cover the Orlando killer. I wanted the Senator to know that. Thank you very much. Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I would say to my friend from California, the problem in this instance is this shooter was a licensed security guard. He was guarding a courthouse. He also had a firearms license from the State of Florida. So there is nothing about her amendment that would have pre-vented him from purchasing a firearm. Indeed, the only thing that might have happened would be that the FBI would be notified under the 5-year lookback provision, but the FBI had already con-ducted two investigations of this par-ticular shooter and had cleared him, notwithstanding all of the troubling signals we see now in retrospect. So I still believe there is nothing in the Feinstein amendment that would have prevented this shooter from purchasing firearms because he had a firearms li-cense already and had previously been cleared by two FBI investigations and taken off the watch list. Madam President, I yield the floor. Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, what is the order? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from California has up to 10 min-utes. Mrs. BOXER. OK. I understand that Senator N
ELSON wants some time and Senator M
URPHY wants some time. May I ask through the Chair how much time remains on our side? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is not equally divided. Mrs. BOXER. Let me suggest, then, that after I finish on our side, that Senator NELSON be followed by Senator M
URPHY at times they can work out on our side and Senator G
RASSLEY in be-tween—for how many minutes? Mr. GRASSLEY. You guys want to take up all the time; is that what you want to do? Mrs. BOXER. I didn’t say that, no, sir. Madam President, I think we will let everyone work it out, but I know I have 10 minutes, so I will take that time at this time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from California. Mrs. BOXER. Thank you, Madam President. First, I thank my colleague Senator F
EINSTEIN for her decades of work to address gun violence. I also thank Sen-ators M
URPHY , BLUMENTHAL , and B OOK-
ERfor standing on their feet for almost 15 hours to force the Republican leader-ship to at least allow some votes on gun safety. Six months after we joined the Sen-ate, Senator F
EINSTEIN and I—this was in 1993—learned the horrific impacts of assault weapons when a deranged gun-man entered the law offices of 101 Cali-fornia Street in San Francisco and killed eight people and wounded six others. When you lose someone you know to gun violence, it is very hard to get that out of your soul. And one of those killed in that attack in a law of-fice with an assault weapon was one of my son’s best friends. Yes, the soul of our family and his family and all the other families who were gunned down— I will tell you this: The pain does not go away. And I know we all feel that. I know we all feel that. The question is, ‘‘What are we going to do about it?’’ If not now, when is the time to do some-thing about it? After Orlando—the worst mass shoot-ing in American history—and I see my friend Senator N
ELSON , who has been there and who has looked into the eyes of families, and he will never be the same, having done that. This is a moment for us to do the right thing, to finally take action. Is it going to stop everything in the future? No. But it is a crisis, so we have to do what we can do. We should have done it after San Bernardino, we should have done it after Sandy Hook, and we should have done it after Santa Bar-bara and Aurora, but we didn’t, so let’s do it now. By the end of this year, 30,000 Ameri-cans will have died from gun violence. In 10 years, roughly 300,000 Americans are killed by guns—300,000. We lost more than 4,000 after 10 years in Iraq and nearly 60,000 after 10 years in Vietnam. Losing those incredibly large numbers of soldiers—64,000, roughly, in 10 years of those two wars— tore our Nation apart. It tore our Na-tion apart. But we lose 300,000 Ameri-cans from gun violence over 10 years and my Republican friends do nothing. That is the hard, cold truth. They claim they want to do something, but, as Senator FEINSTEIN pointed out, when we look at the bottom line of their proposals, they essentially do nothing. And the gun epidemic con-tinues. How many times do we come to the Senate floor to send our thoughts and prayers to families, but we don’t do anything of substance to back those prayers up—not since my colleague got through her assault weapons ban. Since then we have done nothing, and that was in the 1990s. Unfortunately, I was just on the floor in December after a mass shooting at a holiday party that killed 14 people and wounded 17 others in San Bernardino. I stood right here, and I begged for us to come together and pass sensible laws to prevent another community from the gut-wrenching heartbreak my state was going through. That was just six months ago. We did nothing. I was on the floor after a mass shoot-ing in Santa Barbara in 2014, and I called for us to pass a pause that gives family and friends who fear their loved ones are going to use a gun in a dan-gerous way—to give them a way to temporarily stop that loved one from obtaining a gun and do it legally through a court hearing. California passed that law. We did nothing—no action. When is it finally going to happen? When are we going to do something? I would urge every single person watching this debate to watch the votes. The only two proposals that do anything are the Feinstein proposal and the Murphy proposal. One deals with keeping guns out of the hands of terrorists; the other makes sure that people who buy a gun at a gun show or a private transaction get a background check. Should terrorists have guns? Every one of us says: Oh, no. Do we need to defeat ISIS? Yes, they are one of the most brutal, vicious ter-rorist groups, and that is why I support the President’s actions to take them out. I was glad to see the Iraqis recap-ture Fallujah from ISIS, but that doesn’t stop the lone wolves over here. We need to make sure those lone wolves don’t get a gun. Should mentally unstable people have guns? No. We need to address that. Should weapons of war be allowed on our streets? Even the inventor of the assault-style weapon—his family said he never meant it to be used on the streets. It is a weapon of war. Those weapons have no business being in ci-vilian hands. Today we have some good news out of the Supreme Court. They refused to take up a case that challenged the as-sault weapons ban in Connecticut. That is good news. It follows the legal opinions we have seen from the Court that say: Yes, there is a right to bear arms, but, yes, you can have common-sense gun laws so that people who can

be trusted get a weapon and those who cannot, do not. Responsible people should be able to get a gun and pass a background check. What happened in the world? Look at this chart. Do you see this big huge line? That is America. These are the rest of all the industrialized nations in terms of gun deaths. We know that tough gun safety laws around the world save lives. Germany tightened their laws and shooting deaths dropped in half from 106 in 2002 to 61 in 2012 after they acted. In Australia, after they acted, gun deaths dropped from 98 in 1996 to 35 in 2014—after they took action. In my home State of California, there was a 56 percent drop in gun violence between 1993 and 2010, according to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, because our State took action. Accord-ing to Johns Hopkins, Connecticut also saw an estimated 40-percent drop in gun-related murders in 10 years be-cause they passed a 1995 law requiring a license before a gun purchase. No, we can’t prevent every single tragedy, but we can respect the Second Amendment and still pass common-sense gun safety laws. We should pass Senator F
EINSTEIN ’s amendment to prevent a suspected ter-rorist from buying firearms or explo-sives, and we should pass Senator M
UR-
PHY’s amendment requiring back-ground checks for all firearms sold or transferred privately. There are 30,000 reasons to pass these amendments—one for every American who will die by year’s end because of gun violence. There is another number I want to conclude with—100. We are 100 Senators. We have the honor and the privilege of being here. We can do something about those 30,000 deaths a year. No, we are not going to cure it all with two measures. It is going to take more time than that. But people deserve to be safe at work, safe at school, safe at a shopping mall, at a movie theater, at a res-taurant, at a health care clinic, and, yes, at a nightclub. So it is up to us to act. One hundred of us can look at the fact that we lose 300,000 Americans over 10 years, and we have done noth-ing since the 1990s. Today we can change all that. I do thank so very much my col-leagues, Senator F
EINSTEIN and Sen-ator B
LUMENTHAL , for their work on this legislation. Mr. President, I retain the time for the debate on our side. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. C
OATS ). The Senator from Iowa. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, be-fore I speak, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to speak for up to 20 minutes, to be followed by Senators Nelson and Murphy for 5 minutes each. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, would you please tell me when I have used 17 minutes, and then I want to re-serve 3 minutes for the Senator from Pennsylvania to follow me with his 3 minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will do so. AMENDMENT NO . 4751 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I wish to address three topics. First, I want to express my unwaver-ing support for those who were killed and wounded in Orlando and for their families, friends, loved ones, and com-munity members. This terrorist attack represents a great tragedy and an affront to our way of life and very existence as Amer-icans. I look forward to doing what I can as chairman of the Judiciary Committee to support and give the FBI the tools it needs to investigate the circumstances of this attack by a radical Islamic ter-rorist. All Americans have every reason to be upset and even furious over the deadliest attack since the awful events of September 11. I, too, am angry. I am angry that this individual was interviewed twice, yet evaded detection. I am angry that this radical made his plans known to others and generally raised suspicions of oth-ers, yet was still able to carry out his horrific plot. And I am upset that the attack in a sense reflects the failure of our foreign policy. There are more lone wolf at-tacks because there are more lone wolves. I was asked recently: Why does it make any difference whether President Obama references ‘‘radical Islamic ter-rorism’’ or not? The answer is that growing numbers of jihadists are spewing radical Islamic terrorist ideology over the Internet, radicalizing Americans into lone wolves. President Obama said, after the Or-lando attack, that the shooter was not involved in a ‘‘larger plot,’’ as if that would provide comfort. By not calling out that the attack developed from radical Islamic ter-rorism, he failed to recognize the dan-gerous ideology that derives from rad-ical Islam and its deadly influence on individuals who are not part of any ‘‘larger plot.’’ Moving on to my second course of business, I am here to talk about guns and the Second Amendment. Over the course of multiple hours on Wednesday, we heard my colleagues across the aisle take all of their anger and focus it on firearms—not the war on terror, not radical Islam, not our porous borders, but guns. Through the hours of finger wagging, many things were stated as the gospel truth, and if we are truly to have a dis-cussion regarding guns, those mis-leading or incomplete statements must be corrected. We can have a debate on the merits. My colleagues across the aisle are en-titled to their opinions, but they are not entitled to manufacture their own facts. From the first moment the minority leader hit the floor on Wednesday, we heard erroneous statements on the law on gun purchasing by those who would commit terror. He cited comments from a jihadist that would-be terrorists can go to gun shows and buy fully automatic weap-ons without a background check. Well, they can’t. Even the Washington Post Fact Checker gave the minority leader two pinocchios on this claim. No one can buy a fully automatic weapon without a background check. The gun used in Orlando was not a fully automatic weapon. It was a semi-automatic weapon, where each pull of the trigger makes one shot. Those guns are used legitimately for recreational purposes by large numbers of law-abiding Americans for target practice. Surely the minority leader knows the law on this point. The fact that a radical Islamic ter-rorist would lie about the law is not a reason that the law needs to be changed. The minority leader also invoked what he referred to as the ‘‘terror loop-hole.’’ So did the Senator from Connecticut, whose amendment is before us. What is this terror loophole? To hear the minority talk about it, it means that terrorists are able to law-fully purchase firearms. This is nonsense. Anyone convicted of terrorism can’t legally buy a gun. For people we know are going to commit terrorism, I hope that we are not only preventing that individual from buying a gun, but we are either killing, arresting, or detaining that in-dividual, depending on where he or she is found and in what capacity. What the other side means when they say terror loophole is someone who might be on any number of flawed ter-rorist watch lists. If we actually had a list that con-tained only actual terrorists, I would gladly support an effort to not only prevent them from acquiring firearms, but also to detain and bring them to justice as quickly as possible. What we really have are these flawed watch lists that contain errors and are at the same time both under- and over- inclusive. Time and again, the other side says they support Second Amendment rights. Don’t believe them. The terrorist watch list amendment they now propose achieves the remark-able feat of violating two different pro-visions of the Bill of Rights at the same time. It violates the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms and it vio-lates the Fifth Amendment’s Due Proc-ess Clause. The Senator from Connecticut has discussed on the floor that the Second Amendment is not absolute.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4347 June 20, 2016 
That is a truism. No one says it is ab-solute. The question for the other side is: What rights do they think the Second Amendment protects? Secretary Clinton has refused to say that she believes that the Second Amendment protects a fundamental in-dividual right. If it doesn’t, then what individual rights of gun ownership does it pro-tect? And the terrorist watch list amend-ment also doesn’t treat the Second Amendment as protecting a funda-mental individual right to own any guns. The amendment violates the Second Amendment because a fundamental constitutional right cannot be in-fringed without due process of law. The executive branch compiles a se-cret no-fly list without notice to the individual, any opportunity to be heard, or any judicial finding that there is probable cause to believe that the individual should be on the list. As a result, the list fails to include some who should be on it, and it in-cludes people who shouldn’t. We know that our former colleague, Senator Kennedy, was on the list. This Senator helped a former high- ranking army officer be removed from the list. The statement that the other side made that there is no due process prob-lem because all these individuals are dangerous is false for many reasons, in-cluding that there is no proof that they are all actually dangerous. Depriving people of constitutional rights based on an inaccurate list and no process at all prior to that denial of rights violates due process. One list is compiled for purposes of allowing flight, which, unlike gun own-ership, is not a constitutional right. It was never designed for any other purpose. To apply it to gun purchases is, in the words of an Obama administration official, ‘‘apples and oranges.’’ But the amendment treats apples as oranges. The other side just doesn’t care that the Feinstein amendment is unconsti-tutional. We know that because experts have made this indisputable point for 6 months since the amendment was first proposed. But when the amendment is offered again, the same flaws appear. Like the Bourbon kings, the sponsors have learned nothing and forgotten nothing. To be sure, the Bush administration proposed a similar wrong-headed idea. But that was before the Supreme Court recognized that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to gun ownership. And Congress did not pass that pro-posal. It is important to note that some of the most prominent voices against the terrorist watch list amendment are people who support gun control. For instance, in an editorial fea-turing a photo of Senators F
EINSTEIN  and M
URPHY , the Los Angeles Times asked and answered the question this way: ‘‘Should people on the no-fly list be able to buy guns? Yes.’’ The editorial pointed out correctly that people on the various no-fly list and terrorist watch lists are not con-victed of any crime. We don’t know that a person is actu-ally dangerous because he or she is on the list. The vast majority of the people on the list are foreigners who are already prohibited from buying guns. And the Los Angeles Times accu-rately stated that, since the Second Amendment is a fundamental right, the ‘‘reasonable suspicion’’ standard in the Feinstein Amendment is too weak a standard for a government agency to abridge that right without judicial su-pervision. And it also faulted the amendment for only allowing a challenge to a gun sale after it was denied, with no judi-cial involvement prior to that point. The editorial also noted that the San Bernardino shootings would not have been stopped had an amendment pro-hibiting people on the terrorist watch list from buying guns been in place. And I will add neither would the killings in Orlando, since this person was not on the list at the time of the gun purchase. Claims made to the contrary on the floor are without merit. My amendment, which I will discuss in a little while, and the Cornyn amendment, would have given law en-forcement notice that this individual sought to purchase a gun, for them to take appropriate action. The Los Angeles Times was not the only major newspaper that editorial-ized against the Feinstein amend-ment—so did the largest newspaper in my state of Iowa, the Des Moines Reg-ister, for many of the same reasons. I know that the minority leader pays close attention to the Register’s edi-torials. But if he blew up their editorial against the Feinstein amendment on a chart behind him on the Senate floor, as he has with various other of their editorials, I must have missed it. Just this past week, the New York Times ran an opinion piece by Adam Winkler, another Californian, and a law professor at UCLA. Professor Winkler noted that the Na-tional Rifle Association has raised ob-jections to the Feinstein amendment, in particular, that the Attorney Gen-eral has too much leeway under that amendment in placing people on the list based only on suspicion. And they object as well to the bill’s flawed process of denying the sale based solely on the Justice Depart-ment’s say so, and allowing a prospec-tive purchaser to sue the Department in court, but only after their right is denied. But unlike many other gun control supporters, Professor Winkler wrote, ‘‘We should take the N.R.A’s criticisms seriously. ‘‘Due process of law is a vital con-stitutional principle and Americans have a right to own firearms for self- protection.’’ Professor Winkler also wrote, ‘‘If the attorney general believes a suspected terrorist should be added to the list, she should have to go to court first and offer up evidence. ‘‘Only after concluding that the at-torney general has probable cause should the court approve the denial of the suspect’s right to own a gun.’’ This proposal’s violation of the Sec-ond Amendment is demonstrated by considering whether the other side would condition the exercise of any other constitutional right in the same way. Lone wolves are susceptible to rad-ical Islamist terrorist propaganda on the internet. But the sponsors of that amendment would never propose curtailing a per-son’s First Amendment right to search the internet because the Attorney Gen-eral suspected they might be a ter-rorist. What if inclusion on one of these lists deprived an individual of their right to worship at a church, mosque, or tem-ple? Or their ability to qualify for public assistance, the ability to obtain an abortion, or their right to vote? It is not credible to believe that the Senators who support the amendment from the Senator from California would be so passionate about stripping these other rights and benefits based upon inclusion on a flawed list. Let’s talk straight. Taking away a fundamental constitu-tional right based on a flawed list and the Attorney General’s suspicion can’t be called closing a terrorist loophole. I am not sure how you tell constitu-ents that you believe that the Second Amendment guarantees an individual right to keep and bear arms if you vote for that amendment. The terrorist watch list amendment is not only unconstitutional, but is based on faulty premises. Its supporters would have the public believe that a person on that list can go buy a gun without anyone stopping them. This is simply not true. At a Judiciary Committee hearing last December, FBI Director James Comey stated that currently the FBI is notified when an individual in the ter-rorist database attempts to buy a fire-arm. More to the point, Mr. Comey stated there are ‘‘a variety of things that we do when we are notified that someone on our known or suspected terrorist database is attempting to buy a fire-arm. ‘‘The FBI is alerted when that is trig-gered, and then we do an investigation to understand are there disqualifiers that we are aware of that could stop the transaction. And if the transaction goes through, the agents who are as-signed to that case, to that subject, are alerted so they can investigate.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES4348 June 20, 2016 
So let’s be clear, the FBI is notified when someone in the database at-tempts to purchase a firearm, and then they investigate the individual. All of the rhetoric you heard about the FBI not knowing about a par-ticular purchase is not true; they are notified. The reason they were not notified in Orlando is because the terrorist had been removed from the watch list. There have been so many poorly rea-soned arguments and misstatements of law and fact on the Senate floor that cry out for a response. One thing this attack should show is the need for increased ability of our in-telligence agencies to identify and monitor individuals who are either tied to radical Islamic terrorism or are po-tential lone wolves. Recently, a Senator spoke of his un-willingness to give the FBI additional surveillance tools in the form of na-tional security letters for fear that the FBI might use that power as it had un-fairly investigated the likes of Martin Luther King, Jr. This same Member came to the floor Wednesday, demanding we used a flawed list to deny Second Amendment rights without due process. I don’t see how it is possible to si-multaneously deny the FBI the tools its needs to fight terrorism, but favor depriving the civil liberties of lawful gun owners based upon a flawed list that could be subject to the same over-reach. The Senator from Connecticut has of-fered an amendment requiring uni-versal background checks. Such an amendment would not re-duce crime, according to the Deputy Director of the Obama administration’s National Institute of Justice. He wrote that the problems of crimi-nal obtaining guns through straw pur-chases and theft, the main ways they do get them, ‘‘would likely become larger if background checks at gun shows and private sellers were ad-dressed.’’ And the amendment of the Senator from Connecticut would eliminate pri-vate sales. Talk about unintended consequences. In the same memo, the Deputy Direc-tor concluded concerning universal background checks that their ‘‘[e]ffectiveness depends on . . . requir-ing gun registration.’’ Criminals already don’t comply with background checks. When ‘‘universal’’ checks are cir-cumvented, we will be back here debat-ing gun registration. We should not do anything that will further the cause of gun registration. In addition, the Senator from Con-necticut and others invoke the so- called ‘‘gun show loop hole.’’ That is the leading basis offered for his amendment. Anyone watching the floor Wednes-day and today would be left with the impression that people who buy a fire-arm at a gun show aren’t subject to a background check. In fact, all gun show purchases made from commercial gun dealers require a background check. These commercial gun dealers, or Federal firearms licensees as the law refers to them, typically make up the majority of the gun vendors at gun shows. So let’s be clear: If someone goes to a gun show and purchases a firearm from a commercial gun dealer, they are subject to a background check, period. So, then, who are these people who aren’t subject to a background check? If you are an individual and you want to sell your gun to another individual, you may do so, assuming you don’t know or have reasonable cause to be-lieve that such person is prohibited from owning a gun. The government does not dictate where this sale takes place. You can sell your hunting rifle to your neighbor’s daughter, and you can make that sale in your home, drive-way, or a parking lot. You can also make this sale to an-other individual at a gun show. This is what is referred to as a peer- to-peer transaction: Two adults en-gaged in a personal transaction. Just as there is no background check required in your driveway, there gen-erally is no background check required when that private, peer-to-peer sale happens to occur at a gun show. This is not a loophole in the pejo-rative sense of the word; this is an American lawfully selling their prop-erty to another without Federal Gov-ernment involvement. In this same vein, to hear my col-leagues discuss it, you would assume that these gun shows were lawless free- for-alls for felons and terrorists to ob-tain their newest illegal weapon. In fact, local, State, and Federal law enforcement are often present at gun shows, both in uniform and covertly in plain clothes. They monitor and intervene in sus-pected unlawful firearms sales, such as straw purchasing, attempted purchases by prohibited individuals, and the at-tempted sale of illegal firearms. As the Washington Times reported late last year, law enforcement arrests at gun shows hit new highs last year. I recently attended a gun show in Iowa, and there was a robust law en-forcement presence. But we have heard that communities that would otherwise be violence-free due to their strict gun control laws are dangerous because of people who buy guns at gun shows in other States and bring them to those otherwise safe cit-ies, causing large numbers of homi-cides. This claim has no basis in reality. Federal law enforcement is present at gun shows. They monitor vehicles with out-of- state license plates. They stop cars from such shows that head to cross State lines. Their important efforts to enforce the law and to protect us all should be praised and recognized, not minimized or omitted. In fact, enforcement of any kind has yet to be a topic in this debate. The push is for new gun control measures without any appreciation for what can be done to address the prob-lem of violence with the laws already on the books. President Obama has stated un-equivocally that firearms enforcement has been a priority for his administra-tion. This simply is not true. The Obama administration chose to focus its criminal justice resources elsewhere. Federal firearms prosecutions are down at least 25 percent under this President. In addition, he suspended successful programs specifically designed to thwart firearms offenses. Unfortunately, as has so often been the case with the Obama administra-tion, the rhetoric just does not match the action. As I have repeatedly called for, we need greater enforcement of the exist-ing law, which simply has not hap-pened under this administration. In fact, in a remarkably senseless move, the Obama Administration eliminated an earlier restriction on the ability of foreign citizens to purchase guns unless they had lived in a par-ticular State for 90 days. Remember that when considering 
that asylees or refugees or visitors who have not been screened before entering this country under the visa waiver pro-gram can legally buy a gun. Last week, the Senator from Con-necticut contended that there is less gun crime and fewer homicides in States that have passed strict gun con-trol laws, like his State. Perhaps gun crime has declined there. But homicide rates are higher in Con-necticut than in many States that pro-vide greater protection of gun rights, such as my State of Iowa. And leaving aside the question of causation versus correlation, all one has to do is look at Maryland to refute the claim that imposing tougher gun control reduces crime. Maryland, under its prior Governor, imposed some of the toughest regula-tions on purchasing guns. What has happened? Murders in Maryland, and particu-larly in Baltimore, have increased dra-matically. Murder is increasing right here in Washington, DC, despite very stringent gun control laws. The other side wants it both ways, heads-I-win, tails-you-lose. Where crime falls and State laws are stringent, they say the State laws work, regardless of laws anywhere else. Where crime rises in States with gun control, they argue it is because other States have lenient laws. You can’t apply a situational anal-ysis to the effectiveness of State gun laws.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4349 June 20, 2016 
The Washington Post recently re-ported a study that found no correla-tion at all, much less causation, be-tween homicides and State gun laws. And that same newspaper’s ‘‘Fact Checker’’ gave my colleague’s claim three pinocchios. Similarly, we hear that if we only re-enacted the assault weapons ban, we could stop mass shootings. This is an argument not for a policy that has never been tried, but a policy that has been tried and failed. Nonetheless, for some inexplicable reason, we continue to hear calls for an assault weapons ban. Columbine occurred when the assault weapons ban was in effect. Murder rates continued to fall after the assault weapons ban expired. And even Justice Department-funded research found the effects of the ban on crime to be none to minimal. But even when gun control fails, the calls to enact more never stop. Additional gun control, as William F. Buckley, Jr., stated in a different con-text, was once ‘‘a fixed rational convic-tion, then blind faith, and now . . . rank superstition.’’ Once again, the Washington Post fact-checked the Democrats’ erroneous claim and gave it three pinocchios. The Senator from Connecticut has also statements made about online pur-chases of guns, as if a would-be ter-rorist could order one from Amazon and it would show up at their door without a background check. That is not the law, either. Guns can be ordered online. But anyone who orders a gun from out of State or from a licensed dealer online is not allowed to actually take possession of a gun without undergoing a background check. In-state private sales are not subject to that requirement, but that is true of all in-state private sales whether or not advertised on the Internet. The Senator from Connecticut’s amendment would create a new Federal felony for not reporting a lost or stolen gun to local police and to the U.S. At-torney General. This new crime would apply only to lawful gun owners and not to crimi-nals. The amendment provides, ‘‘It shall be unlawful for any person who lawfully possesses or owns a firearm . . .’’ to fail to report the theft or loss. There is no requirement that a per-son who unlawfully owns a gun report its threat or loss. This provision poses a major threat to freedom—because in America, we prohibit criminal actions. Although that limits freedom, it does so much less than a law that criminal-izes inaction. It is very rare to criminalize inac-tion. Only a few classes of people have an obligation to act, like police officers and doctors. But for ordinary citizens, this is rare. One very limited exception is to file a tax return, and it took a constitu-tional amendment to give the govern-ment the power to mandate that. We should not impose a prison sen-tence of up to 5 years on a law-abiding person who fails to act. I have been calling the Second Amendment a fundamental right. What does this mean to you and me as Americans? It means that the right to bear arms falls into the same category as our other most closely held individual rights: the right to free speech, the right to freedom of religion, and the right to due process under the law. It should be emphasized that the Sec-ond Amendment right to bear arms is an individual, fundamental constitu-tional right. Let me remind my minority col-leagues of this as they are ready to run roughshod over the Bill of Rights. Finally, I now want to talk about my amendment, which will be offered as a side-by-side with the Murphy amend-ment. The Protecting Communities and Preserving the Second Amendment Act of 2016 has five key components that are designed to fix our current back-ground check system, among other things. First, as we all know from our own life experience, a database is only as good as the data it contains, with accu-racy and completeness being para-mount. Our National Instant Criminal Back-ground Check System, or NICS, is the background check database for fire-arms purchases. This database needs improvement. In that vein, my amendment requires that agencies containing relevant records make their submission to NICS a priority and provides specific guid-ance that federal courts are to upload their records to NICS forthwith. Yes, we currently have a database that con-tains inconclusive Federal court records; there is simply no excuse for this. In addition, this amendment incentivizes States to submit relevant mental health records to NICS. And my amendment has real teeth, authorizing $125 million for operating and improving the NICS system. Next, my amendment modernizes the prohibition on those with certain men-tal illness or involuntary commitments from acquiring or possessing firearms. We not only update the definitions, but provide critical due process protec-tions for individuals like veterans and others prior to an adjudication of men-tal incompetence. Contrary to what some have said, my amendment does not permit someone who has been involuntarily committed to a mental institution to legally pur-chase a gun simply by virtue of their release. A second, additional requirement must be satisfied as well. Either a court or similar body must make an adjudication, or an appro-priate official of the institution must find, that the individual poses no dan-ger to himself, herself, or others. Mere release from the institution, for in-stance because of a need to find space for another individual, will not allow the person to be able to buy a gun under the plain terms of my amend-ment. Third, my amendment contains mul-tiple provisions that requires agencies to report to Congress on NICS records submissions, firearms prosecutions, declinations, and convictions, as well as Federal ammunition purchasing. There is also a requirement that any Department of Justice component that wishes to use the potentially dangerous tactic of ‘‘gun walking’’ obtain direct approval from the Attorney General, Deputy Attorney General, or the As-sistant Attorney General for the crimi-nal division and include an operational plan with built in safeguards to pre-vent firearms from being transferred to a third party as occurred in the fatally flawed ‘‘Fast and Furious’’ investiga-tion. Finally, my amendment includes a provision that would alert the authori-ties if a firearms or explosives transfer request involves a person who is, or within the previous 5 years was, inves-tigated as a known or suspected ter-rorist. This notification provision would en-sure that law enforcement is alerted when all those who are, or were within the last 5 years, suspected of terrorism, seek to obtain a firearm or explosive. This provision ensures protection of Americans’ fundamental Second Amendment rights, but also alerts key law enforcement officials to the possi-bility of a terrorist plot. The other sides says that no progress is being made on gun crimes. But my amendment would improve the situation, even for people who would favor going further. We can make important improve-
ments, such as through my amend-ment. Senators who are unwilling to sup-port important progress are putting a higher premium on politics. The Second Amendment right to bear arms is a fundamental right, and any legislative action must start and finish with recognition of this fact. Mr. President, I yield my time to the Senator from Pennsylvania, regardless of how much time it is. Mr. TOOMEY. I thank the Senator from Iowa for yielding to me. Mr. President, what I really wish to do is express my deep frustration that we are here with what is about to hap-pen on the Senate floor because we are talking past each other. We have a sys-tem, a series of votes, all designed to fail. We are going to accomplish noth-ing. That is what we are making sure of tonight. It doesn’t have to be this way. That is what is so maddening about this. I will briefly give you one aspect of this. The background check legislation we are going to vote on is the version that

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES4350 June 20, 2016 
goes further than the bipartisan com-promise that Senator M
ANCHIN and I worked out a couple of years ago. What are the chances that is going to pass? I would say pretty close to zero. We know that. If we are going to have a vote on background checks, it ought to be the only bill that I am aware of in recent time that has had bipartisan support. It may not pass, I understand that, but at least it would have a chance. We are not even going to have that vote. Let’s talk about the other big, con-troversial issue that we are going to vote on—we already know the outcome of this vote—and that is about terror-ists and whether terrorists can buy guns and what do we do about this. Let me start with what ought to be a pretty simple goal that we ought to be able to agree on. No. 1, terrorists shouldn’t be able to buy guns legally. That shouldn’t be terribly controver-sial, but it also shouldn’t be controver-sial that if an innocent American is de-nied his or her right to buy a gun be-cause they are alleged to be a terrorist, they ought to have an opportunity to clear their name. Guess what. Govern-ments make mistakes. The Federal Government makes mistakes all the time. The mere fact that they have a list almost guarantees that somebody is wrongly on that list. That is not a reason to do nothing, but it is a reason that you have to have a meaningful process whereby people could challenge their status on the list. I think the bills we are going to vote on tonight have serious flaws. First, the Feinstein amendment. There is no due process at all, nothing to speak of. Think about the way this is designed—the way this bill is de-signed. By the way, we have already had this vote, and it failed overwhelm-ingly. Under the Feinstein approach, the Attorney General can put anyone he or she wants on the list. There is no judi-cial review; there is no kind of review. She can create the criteria, she creates her list, and now all of a sudden anyone on that list is denied the opportunity to buy a gun. Proponents will argue that there is an opportunity for the gun buyer. The problem is that person has to go to court. The burden is on the buyer to prove his innocence, and he doesn’t even get to see the evidence. How can you possibly prove the evidence against you is flawed if you are not allowed to see the evidence? Clearly, that is not a serious attempt to give someone who is wrongfully placed on the list the chance to clear his name. The Cornyn approach. The Cornyn approach is better than what we have now because it creates a new tool. It provides a new tool that the AG does not have—the Attorney General doesn’t have—and that is a 3-day pe-riod during which the Attorney Gen-eral would have an opportunity to make and win a case. I think that is a difficult thing for an Attorney General to do, and I have suggested this legisla-tion is flawed because of that. It is bet-ter than what we have now, but it is probably not enough in many cir-cumstances—which is why we shouldn’t just be talking past each other and revoting on things we know are going to fail. I have legislation, and Senator C
OL-
LINS is working on legislation. What we both have tried to do with different mechanisms is to make sure that a ter-rorist cannot buy a gun legally but also to make sure that the people on the list are put there properly and, if there is a mistake, a law-abiding Amer-ican citizen has a reasonable oppor-tunity to litigate that to get his or her name off the list. In my approach, the Attorney Gen-eral can come up with a list, but it has to be vetted by a court. If someone is not on the list, there is an emergency mechanism available to the Attorney General that would block the sale—it would block the sale if the Attorney General said so—and then provide a reasonable and manageable amount of time during which this could be liti-gated. In other words, if the buyer says ‘‘Wait a minute; I am not the John Smith you think I am, and I shouldn’t be denied my Second Amendment right,’’ under my approach—and I be-lieve under Senator C
OLLINS ’ ap-proach—that innocent American would have a chance to have his or her day in court, which is denied under the Fein-stein approach. The bottom line is we know the Fein-stein bill is going to fail. We know the Cornyn bill is going to fail. They are both going to fail tonight. There is no-body who disputes that. Why aren’t we working on something that could actually get done, some-thing that would actually stop terror-ists from being able to legally buy guns and at the same time give a law-abid-ing American the opportunity to clear his name if he is wrongfully put on the list? That is what we ought to be doing. I am not saying I have the only way to get this accomplished. I think Senator C
OLLINS ’ legislation is going to be un-veiled soon. I know she has been work-ing on this very constructively with a group of folks. But one or the other of these approaches—either the Collins approach or mine—needs to get a vote in this body because it is the only kind of approach that really is a serious way to balance these two important prior-ities and has a chance to earn bipar-tisan support. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Florida. 
AMENDMENT NO . 4720 
Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, yes, this Senator is from Florida. This Senator is from Orlando. This is an AR–15. It is the civilian semi-automatic version of the military version M–16. This is what the killer used in Orlando a week ago. It is the same .223 caliber. It is collapsible stock. It is the SIG SAUER MCX. Do we think that a person who is on the no-fly list ought to be able to buy one of these lethal killing machines? I have been a hunter all my life. I grew up on a ranch. I own numbers of guns, but my guns are for hunting. These guns are for killing, and that is exactly what that weapon did to 49 peo-ple just a little over a week ago. If we have a list, and it is approxi-mately 1,000 American citizens or American people who are here legally, both—not Americans—that category is called American persons. There are roughly a thousand on the no-fly list. If they cannot get on a plane to fly, should they be able to go out and buy one of these? There are another 1,700 folks that are on a selectee list, and those are the ones for which there is close to credible evidence that they are a terrorist— 1,700. There is close to credible evi-dence that they are a terrorist, and do we want them to go and buy this kind of a weapon? Then there is another category, and that is those on what we call the ter-rorist watch list. In this country that is about 5,000 people—American per-sons—for which there is declaratory evidence that they are a terrorist. Do we want them to be able to purchase these weapons? The Feinstein bill—that group of 5,000; that is it in America, there are 5,000. There are many more who are internationals, but there are 5,000 American persons on that list. I don’t think we want them to be able to buy this gun. Even if that had been the law, it would not have caught Mateen. Thus, Senator FEINSTEIN included the bill that I had filed which would catch Mateen because it says if you have been on the terrorist watch list—as he was back in 2013 and 2014, and they didn’t have any prosecutable evidence, so they closed that case—when you purchase a gun, the FBI would be noti-fied so that the FBI could make an up- to-date decision that they want to go back and interview that person. If they had seen Omar Mateen pur-chasing these, knowing that he had been on their watch list, they would have gone and talked to him. That is what is in front of us. It seems to me it is common sense. We hear words out here: Oh, this is the NRA locking down its votes, putting the fear of God in our Republican friends and colleagues about the next Republican primary they are going to be in. I am so proud of the Senator from Connecticut and what he did for 15 hours to bring this thing to a head. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Florida has ex-pired. Mr. NELSON. Thank you for listen-ing to my plea. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Connecticut.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4351 June 20, 2016 
AMENDMENT NO . 4750 
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. I thank all the staff and, again, all colleagues—40 of them—for joining us on the floor on Wednesday night into the early hours. Let’s be clear about what happened. Let’s be clear about the fact that this body was going to ignore what hap-pened last weekend in Orlando—the largest mass shooting in the history of this country. We were going to pretend that it didn’t happen. If not for the ac-tions of Senator B
OOKER , Senator B
LUMENTHAL , 30-some odd others, and me, we would be moving on to business that had nothing to do with keeping this Nation safer. I don’t know how these votes are going to turn out tonight. I know peo-ple are skeptical, but we are at least going to get to see where people stand on some pretty simple concepts—the concept that if you are suspected of terrorism, you should not be able to walk out of a gun store in this country with a dangerous assault weapon. A new poll today tells us that 87 per-cent of Americans support that. Guess what. A greater percentage of Repub-licans than Democrats support that. Do you know why that number is so high? Because this country is under at-tack. This country is under attack, and the new weapon of choice of terrorists is not a plane or an explosive device, it is an assault weapon. After September 11, we made a deci-sion. We made a decision to stop ter-rorists from getting onto planes be-cause they were using them to kill Americans. Well, today terrorist re-cruiters are specifically instructing would-be terrorists to go into gun shops and to gun shows and walk out with assault weapons that, as we saw last weekend, can kill 50 people in an instant. So why wouldn’t we apply the same careful protection and make sure people who are suspected of terrorism can’t get on a plane and also can’t get an assault weapon? Second, why don’t we make sure that protection exists whether they are walking into a gun store or a gun show? That same poll that came out today suggested that an even greater percent-age of Americans—90 percent—support expanding background checks so that you have to prove that you are not a criminal, that you are not a potential terrorist before you buy a weapon. These two measures are not con-troversial anywhere else in the Amer-ican public except for here. And the amendments offered by Senator G
RASS -
LEY and Senator C ORNYN aren’t even half measures. Senator G
RASSLEY ’s amendment would take people off the background check list, would allow people who were leaving a psychiatric institution to buy a weapon the next day. Senator C
ORNYN ’s bill would force the Department of Justice to go to court to stop a suspected terrorist from getting a weapon. They are just shields. They are just shields for Mem-bers who don’t want to stand up and do the right thing. The reason I came to the floor on Wednesday and didn’t leave for 15 hours is that I know at a deep personal level what Orlando is going through. I don’t know what the families are going through. That is something which is unique to losing a loved one. But I know what that community is going through. And I believe that for all of the scarring psychological harm that comes from losing a loved one or a neighbor, more harm is piled on when you find out the people you elected to run your country just don’t care. It hurts something awful when you lose someone, but it gets worse when your leaders are silent—are totally silent— in the face of your personal horror. Long after all of the moms and dads had left the firehouse in Sandy Hook after learning their boys and girls were lying dead on the floor of that school, there was one father who was left and who wouldn’t leave—who couldn’t leave. His name was Neil Heslin. He came to this Congress to tell us his story, and as we head into this vote, I will leave you with his words. In speak-ing about his son Jesse—he was a di-vorced dad with one son, his best friend. His best friend, his son, was dead. He said: Before he died, Jesse and I used to talk about maybe coming to Washington some-day. He wanted to go up to the Washington Monument. When we talked about it last year, Jesse asked if we could come and meet the President . . . because Jesse believed in you. He learned about you in school and he believed in you. I want to believe in you, too. I know you can’t give me Jesse back. Believe me, if I thought you could, I’d be asking for that. But I want to believe that you will think about what I told you here today. I want to believe that you will think about it and you’ll do something about it, whatever you can do, to make sure no other father has to see what I’ve seen. 
My friends, we need to have an an-swer for Neil and the 80 other fathers every single day who join the ranks of those who know his pain. I urge the adoption of the Murphy and the Fein-stein amendments. I yield back.

CONGRATULATING THE CLEVE-LAND CAVALIERS ON WINNING THE NBA CHAMPIONSHIP Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, last night was a big night for Ohio and for the Cleveland Cavaliers in the NBA finals. I have tried not to rub it in today. My colleague Senator B
ROWN and I have been careful not to offend our California colleagues. However, I did wear my Cavaliers tie today. It was a very exciting night for Cleveland. I rise to simply commend the Cavs for an outstanding perform-ance and a really gutsy performance throughout the entire series. This team worked together and they showed that together they could over-come all kinds of obstacles and chal-lenges: Kyrie Irving, Tristan Thomp-son, Kevin Love, J.R. Smith, Mo Wil-liams, Matthew Dellavedova, Richard Jefferson, Iman Shumpert, Coach Tyronn Lue, and then, of course, the king, LeBron James. It was an amazing performance. There have been a lot of good teams and a lot of great professional sports in Cleveland over the past 50 years, but this is the first championship won by a Cleveland team since 1964 and first ever for the Cavaliers so this is a big deal in Cleveland. We are very excited about it. During that long drought, it would have been tempting to go give up, but Cleveland fans never did. They never do. Cleveland is ‘‘Believeland,’’ as it has been called recently, and now it is the comeback city. It was not an easy series. It followed a tough year last year. We had a lot of injuries last year, which hammered our ability to be competitive in the finals, and we changed coaches in the middle of the season. We were trailing three games to one. I went to the game a week ago Friday when we lost in Cleve-land and went out West. It was a tough situation. Being down 3 to 1 in NBA finals means you usually lose. In fact, no one had ever won being down 3 to 1. But the Cavs aren’t just any team; they overcame the odds and showed real grit and persistence, determina-tion, and perseverance. And that is more than just basketball; that em-braces and embodies the spirit of Cleveland, and it is a lesson for all of us. LeBron James put it well when he said:

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES4354 June 20, 2016 
In northeast Ohio, nothing is given. Every-thing is earned. You work for what you have. 
And the Cavs certainly earned it. They worked hard for it, and they de-serve it. It was fitting that the win was sealed by LeBron James, a proud son of Akron, OH, a graduate of St. Vincent- St. Mary High School, and the unani-mously chosen NBA Finals MVP who, by the way, led all players on both teams in the series in every single major statistical category. So in points scored, in rebounds and assists, steals and blocks, he led everyone. We are told this is the first time anyone has ever done that, by the way, in any se-ries. Extraordinary. LeBron scored or assisted on half of the Cavs’ points in the finals. He became the third player in NBA history to achieve a triple-dou-ble in game 7 of the finals. He almost averaged a triple-double. Over the course of the series, he scored, on aver-age, 29 points, 11 rebounds, and 8.9 as-sists per game. His mission to bring this champion-ship to Cleveland is now complete. He came home to Ohio for the same reason so many Ohioans come back or stay in Ohio: That is where he wanted to raise his family, and I commend him for that and also the fact that he really wanted to bring this championship back home. When he announced his return to Cleveland, he said, ‘‘Before anyone ever cared where I would play basketball, I was just a kid from Northeast Ohio.’’ Of course, I want to congratulate Golden State on a historic season, and I want to offer my condolences to my friends and colleagues, Senators Fein-stein and Boxer. Senator F
EINSTEIN and I made a friendly wager on this. To-morrow, since the Cavs have won, she will be giving me a case of California wine, and I am pleased I get to keep the case of Great Lakes beer that I had bought for her. Congratulations to general manager David Griffin, who made a lot of dif-ficult decisions and took the risks nec-essary in putting together a champion-ship team. Congratulations to the owner, Dan Gilbert. This is a guy whose strong and consistent support of Cleveland, both on the court and off the court, is pay-ing off for Cleveland, and we appreciate him—and, of course, for his helping to be sure LeBron James came back. Congratulations, above all, to Believeland—to Cleveland—and to an incredible championship run here. Mr. President, I am all in for the Cavs. I yield back. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. WORLD REFUGEE DAY Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, we commemorate World Refugee Day. It is a day we make clear that we stand with those who have survived the hor-rors of war, torture, and persecution. It is a day when we remember our com-mon humanity and the moral impera-tive to love and care for one another. I can think of no better time than now to pause and remember those funda-mental principles. The rhetoric of hate and intolerance has reached a fright-ening pitch in this country, much of it directed against innocent victims of persecution. We must forcefully reject this un-American rhetoric. With more than 65 million people forcibly dis-placed around the globe, we must not lower our torch—we must raise it high-er. Our national values demand it, and our national interest requires it. As we reflect upon the fate of refugees across the world, we must reclaim our history as a refuge for the persecuted. Today— and every day—I stand with refugees. Over the past 5 years, the world has witnessed millions of Syrians des-perately fleeing the terror inflicted by ISIS and Bashar Al-Assad’s regime. Hundreds of thousands have died, and more than half of Syria’s 23 million people have been forced from their homes. The vast majority of these are women and children. As a humani-tarian leader among nations, the United States must play a significant role in efforts to resettle those dis-placed by this devastating conflict. While we must do more for Syria and the surrounding countries, we must not turn a blind eye to the humanitarian crisis growing even closer to home. In the Northern Triangle of Central America, ruthless armed criminal or-ganizations in El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala brutalize women and children with impunity. El Salvador and Guatemala have the highest child murder rates in the world—higher even than the child murder rates in the once-active war zones of Iraq and Af-ghanistan. These three Central Amer-ican countries also account for some of the highest rates of female homicides worldwide. This pandemic of gang vio-lence in the Northern Triangle has forced thousands of mothers and chil-dren to flee and seek refuge wherever they can find it. I remain deeply trou-bled by the administration’s con-tinuing immigration raids directed at these vulnerable women and children. We must do everything we can to en-sure that these individuals receive meaningful due process before they are sent back to the chaos and violence from which they fled. In the face of such staggering suf-fering, we must live up to our long tra-dition of being a safe and welcoming haven for those fleeing persecution. Since the passage of the landmark Ref-ugee Act of 1980, the people and com-munities of the United States have opened their arms to more than 2.5 mil-lion refugees. America is the great country that it is because of the con-tributions of refugees, including the likes of Albert Einstein and Madeleine Albright. I am especially proud that Vermont has welcomed nearly 8,000 refugees from more than a dozen war-torn coun-tries. These refugees have enriched our communities and are making impor-tant contributions to our State. They have become college-educated citizens, small business owners, nurses, and soc-cer coaches. Recently, Mayor Chris-topher Louras and members of the Rut-land community announced plans to resettle 100 Syrian refugees. I applaud their decision, which should serve as an example to other communities in Vermont and across the country. I am confident that Vermont will prove to be a welcoming home for all of these families. And we must do more. Last year, the United States announced a very mod-est plan to resettle 10,000 refugees. To date, however, we have admitted only a fraction of that number. Despite recent attempts to foment our fears, we must not forget that refugees continue to be the most stringently vetted travelers to the United States. And we must re-member that ISIS is our enemy; the suffering Syrian people fleeing ISIS are not. Months ago, the heartbreaking image of 3-year-old Aylan Kurdi’s lifeless body washed up on a beach stirred the conscience of the international com-munity. The image was forever seared in my mind, laying bare the human cost of the Syrian crisis. In the United States, there were passionate calls for our country to live up to its humani-tarian legacy. Amid today’s hateful rhetoric against refugees, we must once again conjure up that image of Aylan. We must reaffirm our commit-ment to those risking their lives to flee persecution. Now, more than ever, the world needs the United States to lead. Soon, I will reintroduce the Refugee Protection Act of 2016. Our bicameral bill would make important strides in bolstering and updating our Nation’s laws to address the unprecedented ref-ugee crisis we face today, honoring our rich history as a refuge for the per-secuted. In this dark chapter of human history, there are dangerous voices urging us to lower our torch. Let the world see that the United States chose instead to hold its torch even higher.

WORLD ELDER ABUSE AWARENESS DAY Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I have fought for years to protect our Nation’s seniors from abuse and exploi-tation—initially, in my capacity as former chairman of the Senate Aging Committee and more recently as chair-man of the Senate Judiciary Com-mittee. Last Wednesday was World Elder Abuse Awareness Day, but be-cause the Democrats were unfortu-nately blocking the business of the American people on the Senate floor, I was unable to give this statement, so I want to take this opportunity today to express my renewed commitment to ending the abuse and exploitation of older Americans. We don’t know the full extent and scope of the problem of elder abuse, mainly due to underreporting. Many older Americans don’t report instances of elder abuse due to embar-rassment, a refusal to acknowledge that they were victimized, or reliance on the perpetrator as their caretaker. But we do know that serious cases of abuse or exploitation of older Ameri-cans seem to be increasing and that it can take several forms: financial, phys-ical, and emotional. Financial exploitation is the most widespread form of elder abuse, costing seniors in the U.S. between an esti-mated $2.9 and $36 billion annually. In fact, it is been called ‘‘the crime of the 21st century.’’ In my home State of Iowa, for exam-ple, so-called grandparent scams are becoming more prevalent. Fraudsters initiating a grandparent scam will present themselves to a senior citizen as a grandchild in distress, in the hope of convincing the grandparent to im-mediately send cash or give out a cred-it card number. Another common scam in Iowa is the sweetheart scam, in which criminals cultivate a romantic relationship with a lonely elder, typically online, and then convince the senior to part with their hard-earned money. Across the United States, con artists reportedly are also using sweepstakes scams to steal money. A senior is called and told they have won some great prize or sum of money, but before they can claim the supposed prize, the victim is required to pay taxes or proc-essing fees. Once the money is paid to cover the taxes and fees, however, no prize ever materializes. Other instances of elder financial ex-ploitation are more personal in nature and have especially devastating effects. Some victims are pressured into sign-ing over a deed, modifying a will, or giving a power of attorney. Americans have lost their farms, homes, and life savings to this form of fraud. In Iowa, we have recently revised our laws to protect against these types of abuse, and I will be doing what I can to raise awareness to help stop this nationwide. Physical abuse is another form of abuse that can have a devastating im-pact on older Americans. In fact, older Americans who experience physical abuse reportedly have a 300 percent greater chance of dying sooner. Many older Americans may also face emotional abuse. According to the Na-tional Center on Elder Abuse, common examples of emotional abuse include treating an elder like an infant, iso-lating an elderly person from his or her loved ones or regular activities, and giving an older person the ‘‘silent treatment.’’ I have also recently become aware of instances of seniors in nursing homes who were unknowingly photographed in embarrassing and compromising sit-uations. These photos or videos wind up on social media outlets, such as Snapchat, Facebook, and Instagram, simply so a depraved individual can get a few cheap laughs or attention. I sent a letter to the Attorney Gen-eral and the Health and Human Serv-ices inspector general on this very issue earlier this year because it re-mains unclear to me what specifically is being done on a Federal level to stop this form of abuse. I have sent letters to Snapchat, Facebook, and Instagram to better un-derstand what efforts they have taken to help prevent this form of abuse of nursing home residents. And I wrote to the American Health Care Association to inquire about the efforts, if any, that nursing homes have taken to pre-vent this activity. I also recently called upon the Jus-tice Department to detail the steps it is taking to protect seniors from finan-cial exploitation. I have asked the De-partment what it is doing to combat government imposter scams that are bilking millions of dollars out of the pockets of older Americans. Combating elder abuse and exploi-tation requires all of us to work to-gether in a bipartisan way. To this end, I will convene a Judiciary Committee hearing later this month on the subject of elder financial exploitation. This hearing will give us a chance to examine whether the Federal Govern-ment is doing all it can to prevent older Americans from being victimized and to ensure that perpetrators are held accountable. We also will hear from State officials on how to best edu-cate older Americans about the ever- changing forms of elder abuse and fi-nancial exploitation. Local, State, and Federal law en-forcement agencies are on the front lines in responding to crimes of elder abuse. For this reason, I would like to take a moment to highlight the efforts of the many adult protective service units, local prosecutors, and other practitioners across the country who have helped bring the perpetrators to justice. I would also like to recognize family, friends, and caretakers who report in-stances of elder abuse and help their communities better understand the na-ture of this problem. In closing, I invite my colleagues to use World Elder Abuse Awareness Day as an opportunity to highlight the problem of elder abuse and to rededi-cate efforts to protect our Nation’s seniors. These men and women are our fathers and mothers, sisters and broth-ers, mentors and friends. They are the fabric of our country and communities, our greatest generation, and we owe it to them to protect their dignity in their golden years. Thank you.

REMEMBERING GEORGE VOINOVICH Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, George Voinovich served in this body as the Senator from Ohio from 1999 until 2010. Senator Voinovich was a friend of mine, and I think our col-leagues would agree with me that he was among the most respected mem-bers of this body. He was respected for his thoughtfulness, for his humility, for his self-effacing nature. It is sometimes said that the Senate is composed of 100 prospective Presi-dents of the United States, each of whom is just waiting for the American people to recognize their unappreciated talents. That concept did not apply to George Voinovich. It is not that he was not well prepared to assume the high-est office in the land; George Voinovich simply chose to make his contribution in a different way. George Voinovich was one of the most prepared people ever to serve in the Senate. He was responsible for the turnaround of the city of Cleveland; elected as a Republican mayor in a Democratic town. He served as Lieu-tenant Governor and Governor the State of Ohio. He was elected by his peers first to the role of president of the National League of Cities and sub-sequently to chair the National Gov-ernors Association. In the Senate, he contributed signifi-cantly to the work of the Foreign Rela-tions Committee, the Homeland Secu-rity and Governmental Affairs Com-mittee, the Environment and Public Works Committee, and the Appropria-tions Committee. This was a ‘‘workhorse’’ not a ‘‘show horse.’’ For a politician, he was delib-erately the ‘‘unpolitician.’’ An indi-vidual who built a reputation on his ef-forts and accomplishments and not on his press releases. Approachable and grassroots as they come, which is espe-cially an admirable quality in one who represents a large State. It bears re-peating: ‘‘a self-effacing and humble man.’’ George Voinovich was one of the most principled people ever to serve in this body. He was profoundly inde-pendent in his thinking. He was frugal in both his policy and in his personal

lives. He was a family man—in fact, an individual prone to public displays of affection. Completely devoted to his wife, Janet, his children, and his grand-children. He was a pillar of the Cleve-land community, proud of his ethnic heritage and a role model for immi-grants. George Voinovich was the chil-dren of immigrants, and his career demonstrates how far one can go in this great Nation through hard work and character. He was a profoundly ethical individual, chosen by his Sen-ate colleagues to lead the Senate Eth-ics Committee. He epitomized the way the Senate should be. Senator Voinovich’s loss is not only a loss for Ohio, but a loss to the Na-tion. For even in retirement, Senator Voinovich had much to contribute to the public discourse. Days before his death, he was out making speeches. He never slowed down. He was expected to serve as a delegate to the 2016 Repub-lican National Convention in his be-loved Cleveland. So let me take this opportunity on behalf of the people of Alaska to thank Janet for sharing George with the Na-tion. I express condolences to the en-tire Voinovich family. The Voinovich family also includes Senator Voinovich’s former staff mem-bers, some of whom are still part of our Senate family. I would like to person-ally express condolences to Tara Shaw, who served Senator Voinovich on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. After Senator Voinovich’s retirement, Tara came to my office in the role of legislative di-rector and currently serves as legisla-tive director to the Senator from Wyo-ming, Mr. E
NZI. Great Senators groom great staff members. And George Voinovich was one great Senator.

TRIBUTE TO DAVID WEINER Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, today, along with my colleague, the ranking member of the Budget Committee, Sen-ator S
ANDERS , I wish to honor and rec-ognize the outstanding service of David Weiner on his retirement after 32 years of public service, including 25 years at the Congressional Budget Office. Da-vid’s expertise as a forecaster, modeler, and policy analyst have made him an invaluable contributor to the develop-ment of much of the key tax legisla-tion of the past quarter century, start-ing with the Tax Reform Act of 1986. Since 2013, David has led CBO’s tax analysis division, superbly overseeing its forecasts of tax revenues, cost esti-mates of legislative proposals, reports on important current issues in tax pol-icy, and development of the modeling infrastructure needed to conduct those tasks. David’s first job in Washington was as an evaluator at the U.S. General Ac-counting Office. He then moved to the Office of Tax Analysis in the Depart-ment of Treasury, where he con-structed models to estimate revenue effects and produce economic analyses of numerous tax proposals, including those related to capital gains, cor-porate tax integration, and taxpayer compliance. At Treasury and later at CBO, David was also responsible for the forecasts of individual income tax re-ceipts. CBO was very fortunate in 1991 when David brought his skills to the agency, where he built and maintained microsimulation models used for fore-casting receipts and analyzing changes in the distribution of tax burdens. He also wrote influential studies on crit-ical topics in tax policy, including marriage penalties and bonuses in the tax system and effective Federal tax rates. In the tax analysis division, David served as the unit chief for mod-eling from 2002 to 2009, Deputy Assist-ant Director from 2009 to 2013, and As-sistant Director for the rest of his ten-ure at CBO. As head of the tax analysis division, David has led his staff in providing high-quality and timely analysis of tax policy and budget issues. His expansive knowledge of tax policy and how it interacts with other facets of public policy has been a tremendous resource to the Congress. Colleagues who have worked with David appreciate his un-canny ability to find solutions to chal-lenges and his commitment to pro-ducing top-caliber analyses but they will especially miss his wit, his gen-erosity with his time and knowledge, and his compassion. I know my colleagues join me in ex-tending our thanks and appreciation to David for his service to our Nation. We wish him well in his retirement from CBO and hope he will continue in fu-ture years to lend his expertise to the analysis of important tax policy issues. I would like to now yield to my col-league Senator SANDERS for his re-marks. Mr. SANDERS. I thank Mr. E
NZIand join him in commending Mr. Weiner for his many years of dedicated and out-standing service to CBO, the Congress, and the American people.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO DARIN GORDON ∑Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I request that a copy of my letter to Darin Gordon, TennCare director and deputy commissioner of the Tennessee Health Care Finance Administration, be printed in the R
ECORD . The material follows: 
TRIBUTE TO DARIN GORDON  I am writing to express my sincere appre-ciation for your service as director of TennCare over the past 10 years. As the state’s longest-serving TennCare di-rector and the longest-serving Medicaid di-rector in the country, you have helped tran-sition our state’s Medicaid program from being one of Tennessee’s biggest budget headaches to being consistently ranked as one of the nation’s most fiscally responsible. As Governor of Tennessee, I saw firsthand the impact that runaway health care costs can have on other important state pro-grams—like higher education and roads and bridges. For the past ten years, you have worked tirelessly to restrain unnecessary state spending on TennCare and have devel-oped innovative solutions to increase patient access and satisfaction. Your leadership has proven that you understand how critical it is for the state to get health care costs under control, and I’m also impressed with what you’ve been able to accomplish under both a Democratic and Republican governor. Medicaid spending is on track to double over the next ten years. Congress needs ad-vice on growing entitlement programs from experienced leaders like you because you un-derstand the challenges states are facing and how the federal role has contributed to the increases in state spending related to Med-icaid. You have led TennCare through chal-lenging times and have been instrumental in helping the state modernize its Medicaid de-livery system. I thank you for your service to Tennesseans and your willingness to work with me and my staff to help advance good Medicaid policies and avoid Washington mandates. I wish you the best as you continue your professional career. Very best wishes.∑ f GREENFIELD’S 225TH ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION ∑Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, today I wish to honor Greenfield, NH—a flour-ishing community in Hillsborough County that is celebrating the 225th anniversary of its founding. I am proud to join citizens across the Granite State in recognition of this special event. Greenfield originally encompassed parts of the towns of Peterborough and Lyndeborough, as well as the Lyndeborough Slip and Society Land until the residents petitioned the Gen-eral Court of New Hampshire to be-come a separate town, so that they might have access to a church and school. Permission was granted, and the town of Greenfield was incor-porated on June 15, 1791. Founded primarily by Revolutionary War veterans, the town of Greenfield was named by Major Amos Whittemore for its peaceful and fertile location be-tween the Monadnock Hills. The early settlers were known for growing hops, building carriages, and their many sawmills. The first townhall meeting was held at the house of Mr. Daniel Gould on July 5, 1791, and since that time, the population has grown to in-clude 1,477 residents as of the year 2014. Known for its mountainous terrain, Greenfield is home to North Pack Mo-nadnock and Crotched Mountains. Due to the prevalence of the mountains, the town contains an abundance of scenic trails that travel throughout the re-gion. This has made Greenfield the per-fect venue for all kinds of recreational outdoor activities.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S4357 June 20, 2016 
Greenfield’s past is well represented by its historic meeting house. The town’s other notable landmarks in-clude the Crotched Mountain Founda-tion, a rehabilitation center for handi-capped children, the County Covered Bridge, Yankee Siege, a onetime world record holding trebuchet, and Green-field State Park. On behalf of all Granite Staters, I am pleased to offer my congratulations to the citizens of Greenfield as they cele-brate 225 years of exemplifying what is best about our home, and I thank them for their many integral contributions to the life and spirit of New Hamp-shire.∑

TRIBUTE TO KENNETH KUEHNL ∑Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Kenneth Kuehnl who earlier this month left the posi-tion of Wisconsin State adjutant and chief operating officer of the Disabled American Veterans, DAV, after 11 years. As Ken steps down from his lead-ership role with the Wisconsin DAV, I want to acknowledge Ken’s service to Wisconsin and our Nation. Ken is a Vietnam war veteran who began his U.S. military service in April 1971. He is a longtime member of the DAV Kenosha Chapter 20 in Wisconsin, with 34 years as a DAV member. Before becoming the Wisconsin DAV State ad-jutant and chief operating officer in 2005, Ken served as the Wisconsin de-partment commander from 1996 to 1997. I hope all of my colleagues will join me in offering our congratulations to Ken Kuehnl and his wife, Lynn. Ken has dedicated his time, talents, and en-ergy to serving the finest among us, our Nation’s veterans. I thank Ken for his service and wish him continued suc-cess in the future.∑

TRIBUTE TO JOHN NIEBERGALL ∑Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to honor a great edu-cator in my home State. John Niebergall of Sherwood, OR, has been recognized as a White House ‘‘Cham-pion of Change.’’ John’s tremendous recognition and White House visit is well deserved. As an educator for more than 30 years, he has provided so many students at Sherwood High School with hands-on learning opportunities that prepare them for a 21st century career after graduation. On May 4, I had the opportunity to visit Sherwood High School to witness firsthand the remarkable projects stu-dents were turning out in John’s Mo-bile Makerspace. Students enrolled in his career and technical education pro-grams—otherwise known as CTE courses—showed me their expertise handling a laser-cutter and a 3–D print-er. John’s students also have access to a welding shop and woodworking shop, where one student showed me a guitar he was building. It was clear to see that students participating in John’s classes were excited about their work and motivated to be creative in the workspace. Research has shown that students en-rolled in CTE courses graduate from high school at a higher rate, and stu-dents enrolled in these courses are more likely to show up to class. After getting a tour of John’s engineering classes and woodshop classes, it is no surprise to me that Sherwood High School is a high-performing school. The connection between good CTE pro-grams and student success could not be clearer. I am committed to supporting pro-grams like the ones John teaches in Sherwood and will continue to do all that I can to provide Federal and State-funded career and technical edu-cation courses at more schools in my home State. His model can—and should—be replicated around the coun-try. That is why I was thrilled to take a ride in his ‘‘Fab-Lab’’ mobile trailer that was full of computers and manu-facturing equipment. He takes this mo-bile trailer on the road to connect with other CTE teachers in Oregon. When teachers like John collaborate with other educators, more students benefit. As part of the ‘‘Champions of Change’’ program, the White House recognizes Americans who are making positive changes in their communities. There is no doubt John is doing just that. I commend John for teaching a diverse course load that exposes stu-dents to the many different types of CTE fields they could pursue after high school. To finish, I want to send a big thank you to everyone at Sherwood High School for allowing me to visit. And I want to send a big congratulations to John for this tremendous recognition. I look forward to working with him to promote Career and Technical Edu-cation programs in Oregon and across the country.∑ f

SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS 
SENATE RESOLUTION 501—EX-PRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE ON RUSSIAN MILITARY AGGRESSION Mr. PERDUE (for himself, Mr. J
OHN-
SON, Mrs. S HAHEEN , Mr. M ENENDEZ , Mr. RISCH, and Mr. G ARDNER ) submitted the following resolution; which was re-ferred to the Committee on Foreign Relations: 
S. R ES. 501 Whereas, on May 25, 1972, the United States and the Soviet Union signed the Agreement Between the Government of The United States of America and the Government of The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the Prevention of Incidents On and Over the High Seas (the ‘‘Agreement’’). Russia and the United States remain parties to the Agreement; Whereas Article IV of the Agreement pro-vides that ‘‘Commanders of aircraft of the Parties shall use the greatest caution and prudence in approaching aircraft and ships of the other Party operating on and over the high seas, and . . . shall not permit simu-lated attacks by the simulated use of weap-ons against aircraft and ships, or perform-ance of various aerobatics over ships’’; Whereas, on January 25, 2016, a Russian Su–27 air-superiority fighter flew within 15 feet of a United States Air Force RC–135U aircraft flying a routine patrol in inter-national airspace over the Black Seal; Whereas, on April 11, 2016, the USS DON-ALD COOK, an Arleigh-Burke-class guided- missile destroyer, was repeatedly buzzed by Russian Su-24 attack aircraft while oper-ating in the Baltic Sea. United States offi-cials described the low-passes as having a ‘‘simulated attack profile’’; Whereas, on April 12, 2014, a Russian Su–24 again conducted close-range low altitude passes for about 90 minutes near the DON-ALD COOK; Whereas the United States European Com-mand expressed ‘‘deep concerns’’ about the April 11 and 12, 2016, Russian close-range passes over the DONALD COOK and stated that the maneuvers were ‘‘unprofessional and unsafe’’; Whereas, on April 14, 2016, a Russian Su–27 barrel-rolled over a United States reconnais-sance aircraft operating in international air-space over the Baltic Sea, at one point com-ing within 50 feet of the United States plane. The Pentagon condemned the maneuver as ‘‘erratic and aggressive’’; Whereas, on April 20, 2016, Russian Perma-nent Representative to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Alexander Grushko accused United States military air-craft and vessels operating in international waters as attempting ‘‘to exercise military pressure on Russia’’ and promised to ‘‘take all necessary measures [and] precautions, to compensate for these attempts to use mili-tary force’’; Whereas, on April 29, 2016, another Russian Su–27 performed another barrel-roll over a United States Air Force RC–135 reconnais-sance plane, this time coming within ap-proximately 100 feet of the aircraft; Whereas the commander of the United States Cyber Command, Admiral Mike Rog-ers, warned Congress during a Senate hear-ing that Russia and China can now launch crippling cyberattacks on the electric grid and other critical infrastructures of the United States; Whereas Russia’s military build-up and in-creasing Anti-Access/Area Denial capabili-ties in Kaliningrad and its expanded oper-ations in the Arctic, the Black Sea, the east-ern Mediterranean Sea, and in Syria aim to deny United States access to key areas of Eurasia and often pose direct challenges to stated United States interests; Whereas the United States has determined that in 2015, Russia continued to be in viola-tion of obligations under the Treaty between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the Elimi-nation of their Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles (the ‘‘INF Treaty’’), signed in Washington, D.C. on December 8, 1987, and entered into force June 1, 1988, not to possess, produce, or flight-test a ground- launched cruise missile with a range capa-bility of 500 km to 5,500 km, or to possess or produce launchers of such missiles; and Whereas General Philip Breedlove, Com-mander of United States European Com-mand, stated that ‘‘we face a resurgent and aggressive Russia, and as we have continued to witness these last two years, Russia con-tinues to seek to extend its influence on its periphery and beyond’’: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Senate— (1) condemns the recent dangerous and un-professional Russian intercepts of United States-flagged aircraft and vessels; (2) calls on the Government of the Russian Federation to cease provocative military maneuvers that endanger United States forces and those of its allies; (3) calls on the United States, its European allies, and the international community to continue to apply pressure on the Govern-ment of the Russian Federation to cease its provocative international behavior; and (4) reaffirms the right of the United States to operate military aircraft and vessels in international airspace and waters. f 
SENATE RESOLUTION 502—DESIG-NATING JUNE 20, 2016, AS ‘‘AMER-ICAN EAGLE DAY’’ AND CELE-BRATING THE RECOVERY AND RESTORATION OF THE BALD EAGLE, THE NATIONAL SYMBOL OF THE UNITED STATES Mr. ALEXANDER (for himself and Mr. D
URBIN ) submitted the following resolution; which was considered and agreed to: 
S. R ES. 502 Whereas the bald eagle was chosen as the central image of the Great Seal of the United States on June 20, 1782, by the Founding Fa-thers at the Congress of the Confederation; Whereas the bald eagle is widely known as the living national symbol of the United States and for many generations has rep-resented values such as— (1) freedom; (2) democracy; (3) courage; (4) strength; (5) spirit; (6) independence; (7) justice; and (8) excellence; Whereas the bald eagle is unique only to North America and cannot be found natu-rally in any other part of the world, which was one of the primary reasons the Founding Fathers selected the bald eagle to symbolize the Government of the United States; Whereas the bald eagle is the central image used in the official logos of many branches and departments of the Federal Government, including— (1) the Executive Office of the President; (2) Congress; (3) the Supreme Court; (4) the Department of Defense; (5) the Department of the Treasury; (6) the Department of Justice; (7) the Department of State; (8) the Department of Commerce; (9) the Department of Homeland Security; (10) the Department of Veterans Affairs; (11) the Department of Labor; (12) the Department of Health and Human Services; (13) the Department of Energy;

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES4362 June 20, 2016 
(14) the Department of Housing and Urban Development; (15) the Central Intelligence Agency; and (16) the United States Postal Service; Whereas the bald eagle is an inspiring sym-bol of the spirit of freedom and the sov-ereignty of the United States; Whereas the image and symbolism of the bald eagle has played a significant role in art, music, literature, architecture, com-merce, education, and culture in the United States, and on United States stamps, cur-rency, and coinage; Whereas the bald eagle was once endan-gered and facing possible extinction in the lower 48 States, but has made a gradual and encouraging comeback to the lands, water-ways, and skies of the United States; Whereas the dramatic recovery of the na-tional bird of the United States is an endan-gered species success story and an inspira-tional example to other environmental, nat-ural resource, and wildlife conservation ef-forts worldwide; Whereas, in 1940, noting that the species was ‘‘threatened with extinction’’, Congress passed the Bald Eagle Protection Act (16 U.S.C. 668 et seq.), which prohibited killing, selling, or possessing the species, and a 1962 amendment expanded protection to the gold-en eagle, thereby establishing the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act; Whereas, by 1963, there were only an esti-mated 417 nesting pairs of bald eagles re-maining in the lower 48 States, with loss of habitat, poaching, and the use of pesticides and other environmental contaminants con-tributing to the near demise of the national bird of the United States; Whereas the bald eagle was officially de-clared an endangered species in 1967 under the Endangered Species Preservation Act of 1966 (Public Law 89-669; 80 Stat. 926) in all areas of the United States south of the 40th parallel due to the dramatic decline in the population of the bald eagle in the lower 48 States; Whereas the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) was signed into law in 1973 and, in 1978, the bald eagle was listed as ‘‘endangered’’ throughout the lower 48 states, except in Michigan, Minnesota, Or-egon, Washington, and Wisconsin, where it was designated as ‘‘threatened’’; Whereas, in July 1995, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service announced that bald eagles in the lower 48 States had recov-ered to the point where populations of bald eagles previously considered ‘‘endangered’’ were now considered ‘‘threatened’’; Whereas, by 2007, bald eagles residing in the lower 48 States had rebounded to ap-proximately 11,000 pairs; Whereas the Department of the Interior and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service removed the bald eagle from Endan-gered Species Act protection on June 28, 2007, but the species continues to be pro-tected under the Bald and Golden Eagle Pro-tection Act of 1940 (16 U.S.C. 668 et seq.), the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 (16 U.S.C. 703 et seq.), and the Lacey Act and the amendments thereto (16 U.S.C. 3371 et seq.); Whereas the trained, educational bald eagle ‘‘Challenger’’ of the American Eagle Foundation in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, was invited by the Department of the Interior to perform a free-flight demonstration during the official bald eagle delisting ceremony held at the Jefferson Memorial in Wash-ington, DC; Whereas experts and population growth charts estimate that the bald eagle popu-lation could reach 15,000 pairs, even though a physical count has not been conducted by State and Federal wildlife agencies since 2007; Whereas caring and concerned agencies, corporations, organizations, and people of the United States representing the Federal, State, and private sectors passionately and resourcefully banded together, determined to save and protect the national bird of the United States; Whereas the recovery of the bald eagle pop-ulation in the United States was largely ac-complished due to the dedicated and vigilant efforts of Federal and State wildlife agencies and non-profit organizations, such as the American Eagle Foundation, through public education, captive breeding and release pro-grams, hacking and release programs, and the translocation of bald eagles from places in the United States with dense bald eagle populations to suitable locations in the lower 48 States which had suffered a decrease in bald eagle populations; Whereas various non-profit organizations, such as the Southeastern Raptor Center at Auburn University in the State of Alabama, contribute to the continuing recovery of the bald eagle through rehabilitation and edu-cational efforts; Whereas the bald eagle might have been lost permanently if not for dedicated con-servation efforts and strict protection laws like the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.), the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act of 1940 (16 U.S.C. 668 et seq.), the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 (16 U.S.C. 703 et seq.), and the Lacey Act and the amendments thereto (16 U.S.C. 3371 et seq.); and Whereas the sustained recovery of the bald eagle population will require the continu-ation of recovery, management, education, and public awareness programs to ensure that the population numbers and habitat of the bald eagle will remain healthy and se-cure for generations to come: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Senate— (1) designates June 20, 2016, as ‘‘American Eagle Day’’; (2) applauds the issuance of bald eagle commemorative coins by the Secretary of the Treasury as a way to generate critical funds for the protection of the bald eagle; and (3) encourages— (A) educational entities, organizations, businesses, conservation groups, and govern-ment agencies with a shared interest in con-serving endangered species to collaborate and develop educational tools for use in the public schools of the United States; and (B) the people of the United States to ob-serve American Eagle Day with appropriate ceremonies and other activities. f

S. R ES. 503 Whereas World Refugee Day is a global day to acknowledge the courage, strength, and determination of women, men, and children who are forced to flee their homes due to conflict, violence, and persecution; Whereas according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (referred to in this preamble as ‘‘UNHCR’’)— (1) there are more than 65,300,000 displaced people worldwide, the highest levels ever re-corded, including almost 21,300,000 refugees, 40,800,000 internally displaced people, and 3,200,000 people seeking asylum; (2) children account for 51 percent of the refugee population in the world, millions of whom are unable to access basic services in-cluding education; (3) nearly 4,800,000 refugees have fled Syria since the start of the Syrian conflict and more than 6,600,000 people are internally dis-placed within Syria; (4) since January 2014, more than 3,300,000 Iraqis fleeing violence have been internally displaced, and 277,000 refugees have fled to neighboring countries; (5) ongoing conflict, violence, and persecu-tion have resulted in the displacement of millions across South Sudan, Ukraine, Co-lombia, and the Central African Republic; (6) since April 2015, sporadic outbursts of violence in Burundi have prompted more than 265,000 Burundians to flee to the neigh-boring countries of Rwanda, Tanzania, Ugan-da, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo; (7) violent insurgent attacks in Nigeria have forced 220,000 people to flee to the neighboring countries of Cameroon, Chad, and Niger, and have internally displaced nearly 2,200,000 people; (8) between January and June of 2016, more than 206,000 refugees and migrants have crossed the Mediterranean Sea attempting to reach Europe and at least 2,800 women, men, and children have died during such crossings or are missing after such attempts; and (9) approximately 95,000 women, men, and children, including many persecuted Rohingya refugees from Burma, have de-parted on the boats of smugglers in the Bay of Bengal since 2014, more than 1,100 of whom have died at sea; Whereas refugees who are women and girls are often at a greater risk of sexual violence and exploitation, forced or early marriage, human trafficking, and other forms of gen-der-based violence; Whereas the United States is the largest donor to UNHCR and provides critical re-sources and support to international and nongovernmental organizations working with refugees around the world; and Whereas since 1975, the United States has welcomed more than 3,000,000 refugees who are resettled in communities across the country: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Senate— (1) reaffirms the commitment of the United States to promote the safety, health, and well-being of the millions of refugees, in-cluding the education of refugee children and displaced persons who flee war, persecution, or torture in search of peace, hope, and free-dom; (2) calls upon the United States Govern-ment— (A) to continue its international leadership role in response to those who have been dis-placed, including the most vulnerable popu-lations who may endure sexual violence, human trafficking, forced conscription, per-secution, or exploitation; (B) to find solutions to existing conflicts and prevent new conflicts from beginning; (C) to provide humanitarian and develop-ment support to countries around the world that are hosting millions of refugees to al-leviate social and economic strains placed on host communities; and (D) to encourage the international commu-nity to increase resources to address current and projected refugee crises; (3) commends those who have risked their lives working individually and for non-governmental organizations and inter-national agencies such as UNHCR who have

provided life-saving assistance and helped protect those displaced by conflict around the world; and (4) reiterates the strong commitment of the United States to protect and assist mil-lions of refugees and other forcibly uprooted persons worldwide, consistent with the val-ues of the United States and with the inter-ests of national security. 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I submit a resolution to mark World Ref-ugee Day, June 20, and to address the unprecedented humanitarian crisis of millions of men, women, and children who are forced to flee from their homes due to conflict, violence, persecution, or human rights violations. According to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, UNHCR, the numbers of refugees and internally displaced people in 2015 up-rooted from their home outstripped even the catastrophic levels of dis-placement following World War II. By the end of last year, 65.3 million people were forcibly displaced worldwide. Fifty percent of the displaced are chil-dren. These individuals and families have been uprooted by violence and persecution in Syria, Iraq, Yemen, So-malia, Burundi, South Sudan, Ukraine, and Afghanistan. These brutal conflicts churning through entire regions are shattering nations, and scattering an unprecedented number of people. Yet, we cannot allow these suffering people to become an abstraction or mere grim statistics. We cannot allow the wearying repetition of the horrors to numb our ability to think of each indi-vidual and each family as people just like ourselves, struggling to cope with unbearable circumstances. Closer to home, rising numbers of people fleeing gang and other violence in Central America have contributed wider displacement across the wider re-gion. Nearly 110,000 refugees and asy-lum seekers have come from El Sal-vador, Guatemala, and Honduras to Mexico and the United States, rep-resenting a more than five-fold in-crease over three years. The relentless, horrifying violence of the Syrian conflict is perhaps the most shocking. By the end of 2015, there were close to 5 million Syrian refugees worldwide, an increase of 1 million men, women, and children within one year. After 5 years of war, the situation is increasingly desperate for both the refugees and host countries such as Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey and Iraq. It is hard to comprehend the demographic, economic, and social impact of mil-lions of refugees on these host coun-tries. The number of refugees in Leb-anon, for instance, would be equivalent to 88 million new refugees arriving in the United States. The futures of millions of Syrian children are being stolen because they have no access to education. In the tiny country of Lebanon alone, there are over 300,000 Syrian refugee children who have no access to school. Over 2 million Syrian women are in the neigh-boring countries trying to survive. Dangerous coping mechanisms are on the rise. More and more families are forced to send their children to work or marry off their young daughters. While contributing generously to hu-manitarian funding, the United States has only accepted about 2,850 Syrian refugees to date. Because Syrians are finding it increasingly difficult to find safety, they are being forced to move further afield. Hundreds of thousands of people, most from Syria, have crossed the Mediterranean in boats in search of protection in Europe. Since January 2015, almost 5,000 mothers, fa-thers, and children lost their lives in their desperate bid to escape violence. We know that the Syrian humani-tarian disaster, which has destabilized an entire region, is not the accidental byproduct of conflict. It is, rather, one result of the strategy pursued by the Assad regime. The UN’s Commission of Inquiry on Syria has documented that the Assad regime intentionally engages in the indiscriminate bombardments of homes, hospitals, schools, and water and electrical facilities to terrorize the civilian population. The terrorist groups Islamic State of Iraq & the Le-vant, ISIL, and Al-Nusra have also de-liberately shelled areas with high con-centrations of civilians. There is also a grave and escalating humanitarian crisis in Yemen. That country was particularly vulnerable even before the current conflict, and now civilians throughout the country are facing alarming levels of suffering and violence. By the end of 2015, almost 200,000 people had fled to other coun-tries, and about 2.5 million people were forced from their homes and live in empty schools, and other public build-ings, or along highways. We are also witnessing violent con-flict that has pushed millions of people out of regions in Sub-Saharan Africa. The outbreak of violence in Burundi forced over 200,000 people to flee their country last year. In Libya, smuggling and trafficking networks thrive as the country has become a major transit route for sub-Saharan Africans seeking safety and security in Europe. Most of these refugees are fleeing Boko Haram in Nigeria, and decades of armed con-flict and al-Shabaab in Somalia and Eritrea, where the government carries out extrajudicial killings, torture, and other serious human rights violations. In the Lake Chad Basin region, more than 2.4 million people—1.5 million of them children—have fled their homes due to violence and attacks by the ter-rorist group Boko Haram. The conflict has forced more than 200,000 Nigerians to flee to Cameroon, Chad, and Niger following attacks on their villages. While violence persists in Somalia, I am deeply concerned about the recent announcement by the government of Kenya that it would seek to close Dadaab, the largest refugee camp in the world and home to almost 400,000 Somali refugees. Shutting down the camp will mean increased protection risks for the thousands of refugees, the majority of who are women, children and unaccompanied minors. Moreover, Somalia is faced with a severe drought and other security risks which will in-crease the vulnerability of its displaced people. The international community must get serious about protecting the most vulnerable refugees—women and chil-dren. Women are facing ferocious threats in conflicts across the globe where rape and sexual assault are being used as weapons of war, and as vulner-able refugees they continue to be tar-gets of gender-based violence. Children now make up one-half of all refugees worldwide. We must do more to protect them from sexual exploitation and abuse, from recruitment as child sol-diers, and from being forced into early marriage. Organizations such as the United Nations Population Fund, UNFPA, Mercy Corps, Catholic Relief Services, and others know how to pro-vide targeted support and protection to women and children refugees. But we in the international community must fund them adequately to help them do the job. The United States has lead in terms of humanitarian assistance, but we must encourage other nations to do more. Against this tragic backdrop, we have all listened recently to divisive political rhetoric and hate speech on refugee and migration issues which is feeding rising levels of xenophobia. In-stead of burden-sharing, we see borders closing; instead of political will, there is political paralysis. Humanitarian or-ganizations and their field staff, over-stretched and exhausted, are left to deal with consequences while, at the same time, they are trying to save lives on shrinking budgets. As the UN High Commissioner for Refugees has noted, ‘‘Yet, there is cause for hope. In contrast to the toxic narrative repeat-edly played out in the media we have often witnessed an outpouring of gen-erosity; by host communities, by indi-viduals, and by families opening their homes. These ordinary people see refu-gees not as beggars, competitors for jobs, or terrorists—but as people like you or me whose lives have been dis-rupted by war.’’ In closing, we must recognize that as these conflicts proliferate, no corner of the world will be left unaffected. Today, on World Refugee Day, we rec-ognize that every person fleeing his or her home deserves compassion and help; displaced people should be able to live their lives in safety and dignity. We must recommit ourselves to work smarter and harder to assist the world’s most vulnerable people. Next year, on this day, I want to stand be-fore the Senate to speak of the progress we have made and the lives we have saved by our collective efforts.

DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2017 
SPEECH OF  
HON. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN 
OF MARYLAND  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, June 14, 2016 
The House in Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union had under consideration the bill (H.R. 5293) making ap-propriations for the Department of Defense for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2017, and for other purposes: 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Chair, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 5293, the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2017, because it fails to support our troops serving overseas. Like the defense authorization bill the House passed last month, the bill uses a budget gim-mick to circumvent funding caps passed into law on a bipartisan basis, and by doing so it not only undermines the budget process, it puts our troops at risk. The bill diverts $16 bil-lion from what our military says is needed to fund our military forces engaged in operations around the globe to purchase ships, planes, end strength, and other items our military didn’t request. Consequently, troops serving in Iraq and Afghanistan will run out of funds half way through the year and would then rely on Congress passing an emergency supple-mental to fill the funding gap. We shouldn’t gamble with the troops we send off to battle. It is irresponsible and reckless. They deserve predictable support for the entire year as they execute their missions, particularly in view of the dangers they face. Going forward, I am committed to work with my colleagues to elimi-nate this funding gimmick to ensure our troops are supported for the full year. We count on these selfless men and women who volunteer to serve in uniform to keep us safe each and every day. They only count on us to provide them the resources they need to do their jobs. That is the least we can do.

CELEBRATING THE CENTENNIAL ANNIVERSARY OF FARM CREDIT 
SPEECH OF  
HON. FRANK D. LUCAS 
OF OKLAHOMA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, June 14, 2016 Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to cel-ebrate the 100th anniversary of Farm Credit. The Farm Credit system we know today was established in 1916 under the Federal Farm Loan Act. This law aimed to increase credit to rural family farmers by focusing on providing capitol for agricultural development. This was important to our country primarily due to the fact that, at that time, families who lived and worked on farms made up the largest demo-graphic of the country. While the demo-graphics of our country may have changed over the past 100 years, the important role Farm Credit plays in our rural communities has not. Farm Credit has made it a priority over the years to invest in and support the industries and individuals that are vital to the success of rural communities across the country. By sup-porting the future of the agriculture industry, Farm Credit helps to insure that agriculture and rural communities will continue to be a vi-brant, successful and lasting part of our coun-try. f 
RECOGNIZING THE 50TH ANNIVER-SARY OF THE POLK MUSEUM OF ART 
HON. DENNIS A. ROSS 
OF FLORIDA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, June 20, 2016 Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I rise to recognize the 50th Anni-versary of the Polk Museum of Art. Located in Lakeland, Florida, the Polk Museum is a Smithsonian Institution Affiliate and, for fifty years, has brought works of art to Central Florida by artists most would see only if they could afford to travel to Paris, New York, or Washington, D.C. The artwork exhibited throughout the Polk Museum of Art includes masterpieces by Pablo Picasso, his lesser-known contemporary and friend, Georges Braque, the renowned na-ture photographer Ansel Adams, the painter Henri Matisse, and many others. Additionally, the Polk Museum is free, pro-viding a way for everyone in the community to experience these great works of art. It offers summer camps to encourage the development of artistic skill in our community’s youth, as well as classes throughout the year for chil-dren and adults alike. I am proud to recognize the Polk Museum of Art’s efforts of 50 years to make our com-munity a place of art and culture. I look for-ward to supporting this institution in the years to come.

IN HONOR OF DOMINION HIGH SCHOOL BOYS’ LACROSSE 
HON. BARBARA COMSTOCK 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, June 20, 2016 Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the boys’ lacrosse team from Do-minion High School in my District who recently won the 2016 4A Virginia State Championship. They practiced long hours as a team, and this extraordinary achievement shows how far dedication, hard work, and commitment to teamwork can take a group as they played against some of the best competition in the nation. Dominion’s boys’ lacrosse team has made Virginia’s 10th Congressional District proud and they have represented us well. Winning a state championship attests to their impressive athletic ability, unselfish mentality, and deter-mination to succeed. I commend them for their tireless dedication to both their school and their teammates, without neither of which this could have been possible. It takes a delicate combination of superior skill and many hours of practice to win a state title. The Dominion boys’ lacrosse team has certainly earned this honor and the lessons learned over the years will valuably serve them as they continue on in their lives. Dominion High School continued Loudoun’s streak of dominance during their 17–4 rout of Western Albemarle during the boys’ lacrosse state final. Their undefeated, 21–0 season was a fitting way for this Sterling team to win their first state title. Dominion’s depth was ex-emplified during an impressive 11–1 second half run. Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in honoring Dominion’s boys’ lacrosse team for their achievement and representing Virginia’s 10th Congressional District with such distinction. I wish them all the best in their fu-ture endeavors. f

Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to the commitment to peace, re-spect and dignity by His Imperial Majesty Ooni Adeyeye Enitan Babatunde Ogunwusi Ojaja II, The Ooni of Ile Ife. About four decades ago in the ancient city of Ile-Ife, Ooni Adeyeye was born into the Giesi Ruling House, Ojaja Royal Compound of Agbedegbede in Ile-Ife. He was named Adeyeye Babatunde Enitan. Ooni Adeyeye Ogunwusi was quietly deliv-ered into the humble family of Prince Ropo and Late Mrs. Margret Wuraola Ogunwusi (Soji Opa family compound, Ile Ife). His father was a radio and television anchor and presentation star that spanned the entire

mid-1980s to early 21st century in the South-western part of Nigeria. Though born quietly, Ooni Ogunwusi’s ex-cellence and outstanding acumen recently an-nounced itself for the world to behold, as he was crowned the 51st Ooni of Ife on the 7th of December 2015. Before his emergence as the Ooni, being an astute entrepreneur, driven by turning ‘‘impos-sibilities to possibilities’’, Ooni Ogunwusi’s Power of Imagination has set him aside, revo-lutionizing the approach to creativity and inno-vation, making a mark in his immediate soci-ety and beyond. He holds HND Accountancy from The Poly-technic in Ibadan, Nigeria. Professionally, he is a Member of the Insti-tute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN); the Institute of Directors (IOD) Nigeria and the Global Real Estate Institute (GRI). Indeed, his achievements in less than six (6) months of ascending the throne as Ooni of Ife are impressive. This bridge builder and advocate of peace had travelled to many parts of Nigeria, preach-ing unity and peace among traditional rulers and promoting youth empowerment to reduce crime rate and unemployment in the society. He engaged about 200,000 youth for em-powerment through Agriculture to complement government efforts to further reduce crime rate and unemployment in Nigeria. He has acquired 30 square miles of land in Ile-Ife for agricultural investments in cocoa, oil palm and rubber plantation which has a great potential for the diversification of Nigeria’s economy. His Majesty commenced construction work at the multi-billion naira Ife Grand Resort, spanning over 1000 acres of land in Ile-Ife, South-West Nigeria. Over 3,000 youth are employed at the project site of the Resort. His Majesty donated of 100 Transformers (250KVA) to various communities to improve power/electricity supply in Ife Land. He empowered over 20,000 widows who are war victims and engaged them for palace and community sanitation with weekly benefits for their upkeeps. He has reached out to over 50 countries through their Ambassadors and country rep-resentatives in Nigeria, advocating global peace and promoting unity with a core focus on Africans and the entire black race. He was appointed Chancellor of the Univer-sity of Nigeria, Nsukka, by the President, Fed-eral Republic of Nigeria. Prior to his ascension to the throne, he was involved in Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) locally and abroad for over 13 years. He facilitated strong trade relationship through the Association for International Busi-ness (AIB) with presence in over 200 member countries across the globe which he set up in Nigeria. One of the key achievements of this body is the trade facilitation between the United Arab Emirates (Jebel Ali free Trade Zone develop-ment) and the Federal Government of Nigeria through Nigerian Investment Promotion Com-mission (NIPC). He developed over 2,500 housing units with various consortia of developers over the last 8 years in Nigeria. He was also a co-organizer for Ondo State Economic Planning and Implementation Com-mittee. He led the Government delegation team to Canada in 2002 for strategic alliances and partnership with Ondo State Government on solid mineral potentials of the State (Bitumen, Dimension Stones, Granite, etc.) which led to the formation of Amalgamated Mining and Ex-ploration Company Limited—wholly owned by Ondo State Government. He was involved in the facilitation and de-velopment of Sparkwest Steel Galvanizing Plant (the only Steel Galvanizing Plant in Ni-geria), National Iron Ore Mining Company Limited and Jakura Mines resuscitation projects, which has eventually become the major limestone feed stock to Obajana Ce-ment Plant in Kogi State, Nigeria. He facilitated the biggest Lead and Alu-minum recycling plant in Nigeria by National Steel Company of India, Ota Nigeria. He facilitated the Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria to discourage Nigerians reliance on importation of rice in 2004. He was the initiator of Essential Homes, a real estate product launched in January 2014, formed to deliver affordable upscale homes to the middle and low income earners. The 1st phase of the product (The Southpointe Estate, Lafiaji Road, Lekki, Lagos State) started in February 2014, and has been successfully delivered within 1 year. He developed the beautiful North Pointe Es-tate Phase I, II, III and Midland Court, on Chevron Drive, Lekki, and Jacob Mews Es-tate, Yaba, Lakeview Park I and II Estates, Lekki, the ongoing Golden Leaf Estate Lafiaji, Lekki and Grand Lake Estate Ajah, Lagos. As part of his commitment to provide good infrastructure in terms of access to roads and electricity for the Lafiaji community, he led the opening up and reconstruction of a 6.5 km road, with a 1.1 km green extension along the Lafiaji/Orchid Hotel road without Government intervention. He established the multi-billion Naira Inagbe Grand Resorts and Leisure, Lagos, Nigeria. The Resort is first of its kind in the whole of West Africa, bounded by the Lagoon and At-lantic Ocean. He was also the Director of Imperial Homes Mortgage Bank Limited, (formerly GTHomes), a leading National Mortgage Bank and former subsidiary of one of the biggest banks in Afri-ca, GTBank. He was Director of FinaTrust Microfinance Bank Limited, one of Nigeria’s foremost Micro-finance Banks focusing on SMEs and micro credit facilities. He is the Founder and Managing Director of Gran Imperio Group, the holding company of Real Estate and Construction, Manufacturing, Facilities Management, Leisure and Tourism companies in Nigeria. Mr. Speaker, I have the honor of presenting to you an outstanding contributor to Nigeria’s prosperity, peace and youth employment. A man considered the custodian of beautiful and rich Yoruba culture and tradition. He is an international business icon, a man of substance, humility, peace, public service, means and substance. He is a great achiever and administrator par excellence, he is the reincarnation of Oduduwa and father of the Yoruba Nation. Please join me in honoring his Imperial Maj-esty Ooni Adeyeye Enitan Babatunde Ogunwusi, Ojaja II, The Ooni of Ile Ife.’’ IN HONOR OF BRIAR WOODS BOYS’ LACROSSE 
HON. BARBARA COMSTOCK 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, June 20, 2016 Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the boys’ lacrosse team from Briar Woods in my District who recently won the 2016 5A Virginia State Championship. They practiced long hours as a team, and this ex-traordinary achievement shows how far dedi-cation, hard work, and commitment to team-work can take a group as they played against some of the best competition in the nation. Briar Woods boys’ lacrosse team has made Virginia’s 10th Congressional District proud and they have represented us well. Winning a state championship attests to their impressive athletic ability, unselfish mentality, and deter-mination to succeed. I commend them for their tireless dedication to both their school and their teammates, without neither of which this could have been possible. It takes a delicate combination of superior skill and many hours of practice to win a state title. The Briar Woods boys’ lacrosse team has certainly earned this honor and the lessons learned over the years will valuably serve them as they continue on in their lives. Briar Woods was just minutes away from its first boys’ lacrosse state championship, but Atlee scored two goals in quick succession in the waning minutes to push the game to over-time. Undaunted, Briar Woods took advantage early on in overtime to score the winning goal and claim the school’s first boys’ lacrosse state title. Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in honoring Briar Woods boys’ lacrosse for their achievement and representing Virginia’s 10th Congressional District with such distinc-tion. I wish them all the best in their future en-deavors.

RECOGNIZING COL DANIEL ‘‘LARRY’’ RUBINI’S 70TH BIRTHDAY

OF PENNSYLVANIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, June 20, 2016 Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 70th Birthday of COL Daniel ‘‘Larry’’ Rubini. The 70th birthday of COL Daniel (Larry) Rubini, (U.S. Army Ret.) is also a tribute to many years of public and military service, and allegiance to the community of veterans. COL Rubini was active in military and vet-erans affairs in Bucks County, chairing the Veterans’ Advisory Committee, which was launched in 2011 to oversee the needs of vet-erans in the Eighth Congressional District. It is acknowledged that his leadership and dedication played a role in one important con-gressional objective in this district, that is, a focus on increasing veterans’ access to med-ical care, education, job training, and employ-ment. COL Rubini’s legal and military background has been an asset to the effectiveness of the Veterans Advisory Committee. He has served as a United States Adminis-trative Law Judge in the Social Security Ad-ministration Office of Hearings and Appeals

and as a member of the Judge Advocate Gen-eral’s Corps, U.S. Army, retiring with the rank of Colonel. Twice retired from the U.S. Army Reserve, COL Rubini was recalled to serve on the staff of the Hon. Paul Bremer, United States High Commissioner for Iraq. He was Senior Advisor to the Iraq Ministry of Justice and an integral part of the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq. Prior to his Middle-East service, he re-ceived specialized training in civil affair ter-rorism and the law of war. Today, he serves as Administrative Law Judge at the Office of Disability Adjudication and Review in Elkins Park, Pennsylvania. With sincere gratitude for years of service and heartfelt wishes for a very happy birth-day—and many more.

RECOGNIZING THE CAREER OF DR. BRUCE HARTER 
HON. MARK DeSAULNIER 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, June 20, 2016 Mr. D
ESAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the many accomplishments of Dr. Bruce Harter as West Contra Costa Unified School District’s (WCCUSD) Superintendent. As the second longest serving super-intendent in the history of WCCUSD, Dr. Harter has played a large role in the district both in and out of the classroom. During his tenure, WCCUSD experienced significant in-creases in the success of English Language Learners, increases in graduation rates, de-creases in drop-out rates, and a significant in-crease in the proportion of graduates attend-ing postsecondary education. As a testament to his emphasis on address-ing the whole child, WCCUSD has made great strides during his service to incorporate addi-tional student services to help students learn and grow. To that point, WCCUSD is now the only school district in the Bay Area to have health centers in every high school, providing greater physical and emotional safety, and im-plementing social emotion programs that sub-stantially reduced disciplinary actions. Dr. Harter’s commitment to promoting the success and well-being of West Contra Costa’s students is deeply appreciated by the community that he serves, and he should be proud of the clear and steady improvement in overall student achievement during his serv-ice. I thank Dr. Harter for his service and wish him the best of luck in his retirement.

This especially showed in the championship game as they exhibited their immense skill to beat George Mason by 12 points as they cruised to their 3rd straight state championship title.

CONDEMNING THE MURDER OF JO COX, MEMBER OF BRITISH HOUSE OF COMMONS, WHO DEDI-CATED HER LIFE TO DEMOC-RACY, EQUALITY AND PEACE 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, June 20, 2016 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to condemn the senseless murder of Jo Cox, Member of the British House of Com-mons who was tragically taken from us on June 16, 2016. Jo Cox was murdered in the street, while fulfilling her duties as a representative of the people. I join in adding my voice to that of the civ-ilized world in condemning this act of political violence. I mourn Jo Cox’s death and offer my deep-est condolences to her family—particularly her husband and two children—as well as her friends and constituents. Today, and far into the future, I will remem-ber Ms. Cox, and honor her dedication to women’s empowerment in the United Kingdom and across the globe. Jo Cox was a tireless advocate for gender equity and human rights, even in one of the world’s most challenging environments. She carried this passion through at Oxfam, and later in Parliament. Jo Cox chaired the Labour Women’s Net-work, which works to engage and encourage women to run for political office. She also founded UK Women, a research institute dedicated to better understanding the views and needs of women in the United King-dom. In what is a perfect testament to her spirit, one of Jo Cox’s last acts in Parliament was to sign a motion recognizing and celebrating the early campaigners for women’s suffrage. Mr. Speaker, tragically, the loss of Jo Cox mirrors the experiences of women and girls all over the world, who are more likely than their male counterparts to be targets of violence in politics and elections. This violence and intimidation has a real im-pact on women’s participation as voters, can-didates, election officials, activists and political party leaders, and therefore threatens the in-tegrity of global political processes, as well as the commitment of governments to a credible democratic process. This senseless act of violence perpetrated upon Jo Cox must strengthen our collective resolve to champion an authoritative effort to reduce and prevent violence against women in elections. When public and private violence and intimi-dation does occur, resources must be avail-able to help women access formal justice mechanisms as well as support informal ef-forts to resolve conflict, especially in local communities. The fear of participation for all people must be taken out of politics. Today, in honor and in memory of Jo Cox, I reaffirm my commitment to empowering women and girls all over the world to partici-pate safely in political and public life. I hope my colleagues will stand with me today to fight violence against women and girls, this month and for all the months to come. I request that the House observe a moment of silence in honor of Jo Cox. f

The Loudoun County High School girls’ soccer team has certainly earned this honor and the lessons learned over the years will valuably serve them as they continue on in their lives. They outlasted Salem 1–0 to achieve the team’s 2nd state title in as many years. The game’s only goal was an impressive header directed into the goal following a long free kick. The teamwork these girls used to get to this moment was on display the entire game as they sprinted and dribbled to victory. Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in honoring the Loudoun County High School girls’ soccer team for their achieve-ment and representing Virginia’s 10th Con-gressional District with such distinction.

HONORING SUSAN H. WARNER 
HON. DONALD S. BEYER, JR. 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, June 20, 2016 Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor my constituent, Susan H. Warner, the former District Director for Virginia’s 8th Dis-trict. Susie Warner worked with great cheer and with a wry sense of humor for 25 and a half years as the district director for the congres-sional district just across the Potomac River. She sat at the helm for twenty-four years for Congressman Jim Moran—his entire tenure— and the last year and a half before her retire-ment for me, graciously schooling the staff in the thorniest case work issues, how to handle every last constituent with grace, and how to keep a warm office environment to boot. During those 25 years, Susie was a pillar of her community in the Lee district of Fairfax County, and a fixture of political life in North-ern Virginia. And I’m sure she will continue to be. So often, when a member of my staff meets a constituent the first thing they hear is ‘‘Do you know Susie Warner? I love Susie Warner.’’ Susie loves all of us right back, and often lets us know. ‘‘How ya doin’, kid?’’ is a routine greeting for almost anyone. ‘‘I love you babes,’’ she told the staff, often as her parting farewell at the end of the workday. Susie’s approach to problem-solving was old-fashioned, in the best sense of that phrase: She is friends with almost everyone she ever met. This included many, many liai-sons in the federal government, who were in-dispensable to solving case work problems. She built those friendships over years of chats and commiseration, and at least one of her federal liaisons cried when told that Susie was retiring. She would draw upon that vast res-ervoir of friends and acquaintances in the community to find the answer for a con-stituent, or to identify and connect someone with exactly the right person in an organization who could fix the problem. She used her sweet talk and her smarts to solve many, many intractable problems for many people in need. Reciting the list of those she helped would keep me on the floor for hours if not days. I learned very quickly to value and rely on her sage advice and judgment, just as Con-gressman Moran had for all of the years in which they worked together. Her leadership will be sorely missed. f 
IN REMEMBRANCE OF OFFICER ENDY EKPANYA OF THE PEARLAND, TEXAS POLICE DE-PARTMENT 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, June 20, 2016 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Officer Endy Ekpanya of the Pearland, Texas Police Department, who was killed in the line of duty on June 12, 2016, when his patrol car was struck by a drunk driver as he was responding to a call for as-sistance. Officer Endy Ekpanya was just 30 years old at the end of his watch. On behalf of the constituents of the Eight-eenth Congressional District of Texas that I am privileged to represent, I extend my deep-est sympathies and condolences to the family and loved ones of Officer Endy Ekpanya. President John F. Kennedy stated: ‘‘A man does what he must in spite of personal con-sequences, in spite of obstacles and dangers and pressures, and that is the basis of all human mortality.’’ Officer Endy Ekpanya upheld this lofty standard. Endy Ekpanya was born in Nigeria and im-migrated to the United States with his family in 1996. One of the happiest days of his life was Au-gust 22, 2012, when he was naturalized as a citizen of the greatest nation in the history of the world. Endy Ekpanya excelled academically, grad-uating from high school in 2004, and earning two baccalaureate degrees, in Psychology and Sociology, from Hofstra University in 2008. After completing his first year of law school at Ave Maria School of Law in Naples, Florida, Endy Ekpanya felt a strong calling to serve as a law enforcement first responder and changed his program of study to Criminal Jus-tice. Endy Ekpanya earned his Master of Science degree in Management and Criminal Justice Management from the University of Maryland University College in 2014 but he did not stop there; he went on to earn his MBA from the University of Maryland University College the following year. Endy Ekpanya chose to begin his law en-forcement career with the Pearland Police De-partment because he wanted to put his knowl-edge, skills, and servant’s heart in the service of a medium-sized department that had a rep-utation for excellence and offered the oppor-tunity for professional development and career growth. Endy Ekpanya joined the Pearland Police Department as a Police Cadet in June 2015 and graduated from the Alvin Community Col-lege Police Academy in December, 2015. Endy Ekpanya was sworn in as a police offi-cer with the Pearland Police Department on December 10, 2015, successfully completed the Field Training Officer Program in May, 2016, and was assigned to Night Shift patrol on D Squad. Endy Ekpanya had a bright future ahead of him but, sadly, it was cut short by his tragic death on June 12, 2016. Officer Endy Ekpanya, exemplified the in-credible sacrifice that police officers make every day when they head out into the com-munity to protect and serve their family, friends, and neighbors. Officer Endy Ekpanya, who is survived by wife, Lucy Lugo Ekpanya, and young son, Ju-lian Ekpanya, leaves to cherish his memory his brothers and sisters on the Pearland Po-lice Department and a host of relatives, neigh-bors, and friends whom he loved very much. Mr. Speaker, I am at once proud and sad to pay tribute to the memory of Officer Endy Ekpanya. I ask that the House observe a moment of silence in honor of Officer Endy Ekpanya of the Pearland, Texas Police Department.

CHARLESTON MASSACRE ANNIVERSARY 
HON. JAMES E. CLYBURN 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, June 20, 2016 Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to the victims and survivors of the Emanuel AME Church massacre in Charles-ton, South Carolina, last year. This was a hei-nous crime and the response of the families and community has been even more deeply impactful. As a longtime AME congregant, a former resident of Charleston and longtime Rep-resentative of the Holy City in the U.S. House, I have a deep and abiding connection to that community. The victims of that horrific crime were my friends, neighbors and constituents. Their deaths pained me in profound and per-sonal ways and the wounds to our community will take time to heal. Mr. Speaker, on the night of June 17, 2015, my friend Reverend Clementa Pinckney left his service in the state senate to travel to Charleston to conduct his other kind of serv-ice, that of tending his flock at Mother Eman-uel AME Church’s regular Wednesday night Bible study. Rev. Pinckney was a tremendous leader in our community. Several weeks prior to that night, I had been with Rev. Pinckney at a service in North Charleston after the police shooting of an unarmed black man, Walter Scott. Rev. Pinckney’s ministry at that event made a tremendous difference in defusing a very tense time and helped restore calm and allow the local authorities to exert justice on a most unjust situation. Into that Bible study entered an uninvited outsider. Though he was a stranger, he was embraced by the worshippers who welcomed him into their weekly exploration of their faith. Yet that hate-filled young man shunned their neighborly embrace and conducted an act of violence so heinous the horror has been im-measurable. Our nation has long had a common sense policy of background checks for prospective gun buyers. Unfortunately, that law has a glitch in it that allows a gun purchase after three business days, even if the background check is not complete, and tragically this shooter was able to purchase the gun due to an error in the paperwork. I have introduced legislation to close this Charleston Loophole in federal law once and for all. This common sense fix will ensure that background checks are completed before gun purchases are al-lowed. I have also been pleased to support the re-quest of the Medical University of South Caro-lina for federal funds to support the commu-nity, and last week the Department of Justice released a grant of more than $3.5 million to support that work. I am pleased that the De-partment has awarded this grant to help MUSC and their partners, the City of Charles-ton and other local governments deal with the continuing needs in the community as we ap-proach the first anniversary of this horrible chapter in our lives. I want to thank Attorney General Loretta Lynch, for expediting this award, and all of my colleagues in the South Carolina congressional delegation for joining me in supporting MUSC’s request. I have been extremely proud of the resil-ience and compassion shown by the people of Charleston and South Carolina following the horrific attack at Mother Emanuel on June 17 last year. The survivors of the attack and the families of the victims have been an inspira-tion to their communities, our state and the whole nation. While the Charleston community has rallied together, as we approach the first anniversary of the Emanuel AME church mas-sacre, we must stay vigilant and continue pro-viding the proper support for the survivors and victims.

COMMEMORATING LGBTQ PRIDE MONTH AND MOURNING THE LIVES LOST IN THE ORLANDO SLAUGHTER OF THE INNOCENTS 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, June 20, 2016 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to commemorate Pride Month 2016, which cele-brates the remarkable achievements and progress made by LGBTQ Movement in ex-tending the promise of America to LGBTQ persons over the last 47 years since the Stonewall Uprising on June 28, 1969 in the Greenwich Village section of New York City. As hard as it is to believe, in 1969 homo-sexuality was still classified as a mental dis-order by the American Psychiatric Association, gay men and lesbian women received almost universal moral condemnation from main-stream religions, and the most intimate ex-pression of love and human connection be-tween gay or lesbian persons was regarded as a criminal act punishable by imprisonment. Today, marriage equality is the law of the land, the policy of ‘‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell’’ has been rescinded, and LGBTQ persons today are serving the communities and our nation in every field of human endeavor, as full mem-bers of the American community. Yet for all we have to celebrate and cheer, our happiness over the progress made to date is tempered by the heavy sadness we feel as we mourn the loss of 49 innocent persons who were killed and the 53 persons injured in the horrific mass shooting at Pulse, a popular and welcoming nightclub in Orlando, Florida. This act of unspeakable horror, which was at once both a terrorist attack and a hate crime, represents the deadliest mass shooting in the American history and the nation’s worst terror attack since 9/11. The Pulse Nightclub in Orlando was a com-munity gathering place offering fellowship, sanctuary, and refuge; a place where men and women met in fraternity and with the freedom to be their authentic selves. Pulse was a safe space until June 12, 2016, when it was defiled by a gunman who used an AR–15 assault rifle to murder 49 people and wound 53 others. Mr. Speaker, the struggle for equality and dignity for the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBTQ) community is a struggle each of those individual communities have faced. Pride Month was established to recognize the collective progress of love’s triumph over hate. Tempered by remorse, today we remember those who were in the struggle; we honor their memory and the resilience of the LGBTQ community. The hearts and spirits of the fallen breathe new life into the valiant stars and stripes that continue to wave. Let us remember the majestic words of the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., who said that ‘‘injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.’’ Notwithstanding the extraordinary progress we have made in the area of civil rights over the past several decades, LGBTQ Americans still face discrimination simply for being who they are. There is still more work to do so long as it remains true that LGBTQ persons can get married on Saturday and fired on Monday. Our commitment to combatting discrimina-tion against the LGBTQ community must not stop at our borders; the fair treatment of all people must always be a cornerstone of American diplomacy. We must make defending and promoting the human rights of LGBTQ individuals a priority in our engagements across the globe. This commitment must be based upon the ideal that all people are created equal and de-serve to be treated fairly with respect. As Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stated in her International Human Rights Day Ad-dress in Geneva on December 6, 2011: 
‘‘Like being a woman, like being a racial, religious, tribal, or ethnic minority, being LGBT does not make you less human. And that is why gay rights are human rights, and human rights are gay rights.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, my congressional district is home to many remarkable members of the LGBTQ community who, day in and day out, work alongside their American brothers and sisters to make our country better in every sector of the economy including the arts, sciences, professions, and as teachers and service members defending our country. Leaders such as Jason Black, Director of Public Health Services for Legacy Community Health Services, who has for decades been tireless in his efforts to remove the stigma as-sociated with people living with HIV and AIDS and to increase the availability of care for marginalized communities. Persons like Fran Watson, Esq. the first Af-rican American female President of Houston’s GLBT Political Caucus, who works tirelessly to ensure that the LGBTQ community fully par-ticipates in our democracy and its interests are seriously considered. Organizations such as Gamma Mu Phi and Delta Phi Upsilon Fraternities; Houston GLBT Political Caucus; Stonewall Democrats and Stonewall Young Democrats; Legacy Commu-nity Health; The Montrose Center; Houston Area Community Services; AIDS Foundation Houston; Houston Splash; and LGBTQ friendly organizations that work to empower Ameri-cans to live their truths. Freedom is not free and the fight to realize the promise of America for every American continues. I commend the courage of the millions quietly toiling in the vineyards to make this happen. Mr. Speaker, today I am reminded of the classic ballad, ‘‘Stand By Me,’’ by the leg-endary Ben E. King: 
‘‘When the night has come, and the land is dark, and the moon is the only light we’ll see; No, I won’t be afraid.

Oh, I won’t be afraid. Just as long as you stand, stand by me!’’ 
America is stronger when its people stand together; all of the people that make up the rich and wondrous tapestry of our country, in-cluding the members of our LGBTQ commu-nities. Mr. Speaker, in honoring the lives lost in the Orlando tragedy, it is important that we say and remember the names of the loved and lost like Shane Evan Tomlinson, who was 33 years old and beloved by all who knew him; an amazing young man who captivated the hearts of so many with his angelic voice and charisma. And there were so many more: Stanley Almodovar III, 23 years old, Amanda Alvear, 25 years old, Oscar A Aracena-Montero, 26 years old, Rodolfo Ayala-Ayala, 33 years old, Antonio Davon Brown, 29 years old, Darryl Roman Burt II, 29 years old, Angel L. Candelario-Padro, 28 years old, Juan Chevez-Martinez, 25 years old, Luis Daniel Conde, 39 years old, Cory James Connell, 21 years old, Tevin Eugene Crosby, 25 years old, Deonka Deidra Drayton, 32 years old, Simon Adrian Carrillo Fernandez, 31 years old, Leroy Valentin Fernandez, 25 years old, Mercedez Marisol Flores, 26 years old, Peter 0. Gonzalez-Cruz, 22 years old, Juan Ramon Guerrero, 22 years old, Paul Terrell Henry, 41 years old, Frank Hernandez, 27 years old, Miguel Angel Honorato, 30 years old, Javier Jorge-Reyes, 40 years old, Jason Benjamin Josaphat, 19 years old, Eddie Jamoldroy Justice, 30 years old, Anthony Luis Laureanodisla, 25 years old, Christopher Andrew Leinonen, 32 years old, Alejandro Barrios Martinez, 21 years old, Brenda Lee Marquez McCool, 49 years old, Gilberto Ramon Silva Menendez, 25 years old, Kimberly Morris, 37 years old, Akyra Monet Murray, 18 years old, Luis Omar Ocasio-Capo, 20 years old, Geraldo A. Ortiz-Jimenez, 25 years old, Eric Ivan Ortiz-Rivera, 36 years old, Joel Rayon Paniagua, 32 years old, Jean Carlos Mendez Perez, 35 years old, Enrique L. Rios, Jr., 25 years old, Jean C. Nives Rodriguez, 27 years old, Xavier Emmanuel Serrano Rosado, 35 years old, Christopher Joseph Sanfeliz, 24 years old, Yilmary Rodriguez Solivan, 24 years old, Edward Sotomayor Jr., 34 years old, Shane Evan Tomlinson, 33 years old, Martin Benitez Torres, 33 years old, Jonathan Antonio Camuy Vega, 24 years old, Juan P. Rivera Velazquez, 37 years old, Luis S. Vielma, 22 years old, Franky Jimmy Dejesus Velazquez, 50 years old, Luis Daniel Wilson-Leon, 37 years old, Jerald Arthur Wright, 31 years old. Maya Angelou said: ‘‘Love recognizes no barriers. It jumps hurdles, leaps fences, pene-trates walls to arrive at its destination full of hope.’’ And let me add that right now justice re-quires us to do two things. First, Congress needs to pass H.R. 3185, the ‘‘Equality Act of 2015,’’ to write into the books of law the same protections for our LGBTQ brothers and sisters that other Ameri-cans have long enjoyed. Second, Congress must pass H.R. 4269, the ‘‘Assault Weapons Ban Act of 2015,’’ to restore the ban on assault weapons so that school children, church going and community members can live their lives free of the fear of falling victim to gun violence.

IN HONOR OF THE WOOD FAMILY 
HON. BARBARA COMSTOCK 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, June 20, 2016 Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the loving generosity of a family in my district, Jaoni and Gabriel Wood. Jaoni and Gabriel were recently named Foster Par-ents of the Year for Loudoun County for their steadfast guardianship of a pair of siblings who needed a home. Gabriel and Jaoni had two biological chil-dren of their own, ages 11 and 9, and raised them in a warm and loving home in Loudoun County, Virginia. They saw at-risk families and children who have been affected by traumatic incidents and took it upon themselves to change their lives for the better. Gabriel and Jaoni created an adoption ministry at the Purcellville Baptist Church in Loudoun County with the goal of teaching the community ways they can serve and help children in need. The Wood family undertook the challenge of fostering a 7 year old boy and his 4 year old sister. After caring for them for nearly three years, the Jaoni and Gabriel plan on wel-coming the two children permanently into their family. While the years have surely been filled with joyous moments, it has not always been easy. Gabriel and Jaoni have spent countless hours helping the newest members of their family feel welcome, while also learning them-selves how to handle the emotional and phys-ical needs of the siblings. By opening their home and their hearts, Gabriel and Jaoni have demonstrated the most sincere form of love possible. According to the Virginia Department of So-cial Services, as of 2016 there are more than 5,000 children who are in foster care in the Commonwealth of Virginia and over sixty per-cent of those children live in a non-relative home. The Wood family wants all of these children to succeed in the face of these hard-ships and it cannot be overstated the incred-ible impact they make on their lives, both through the personal foster care they provide and through the services they have at the Purcellville Baptist Church. Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in honoring Jaoni and Gabriel Wood for their service to the children of our community and wishing them all the best as they raise their new family and continue to help those in need.

JERRY SLOAN 
HON. JOHN SHIMKUS 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, June 20, 2016 Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge Jerry Sloan for receiving the 2016 Chuck Daly Lifetime Achievement Award. Jerry was born and raised outside of McLeansboro, Illinois, where he attended high school and played basketball. He graduated as an all-state player from McLeansboro High School in 1960. The Baltimore Bullets selected Jerry in the 1965 NBA draft, and later traded him to the Chicago Bulls. He retired as a player in 1976. Jerry then was hired on as an assistant coach by the Bulls, and in 1979 he was promoted to head coach. He would serve that position for three years before moving to Utah as an as-sistant coach for the Utah Jazz. He stayed in that position for four years and then became the head coach in the 1988–1989 season. Jerry coached the Jazz for twenty-three sea-sons, with two appearances in the NBA finals. Sloan’s win-loss record of 1,221–803, placed him third all-time in NBA wins at the time he retired in 2011. He coached the Jazz to sixteen consecutive winning seasons and nineteen playoff appearances. His years coaching the Jazz are also the most years a coach has stayed with one team. He is among only nine coaches who have surpassed 1,000 victories and one of two who have won 1,000 with one team. The Chuck Daly Lifetime Achievement Award honors the memory of Hall of Famer Chuck Daly, given by the NBA to a coach who has spent a lifetime in basketball and has a ‘‘standard of integrity, competitive excellence and tireless promotion’’ of the game. I offer my congratulations to Jerry Sloan on his out-standing achievement, and I wish him the best in retirement. f 
HONORING LYMAN ORCHARDS AS THEY CELEBRATE THEIR 275TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO 
OF CONNECTICUT  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, June 20, 2016 Ms. D
ELAURO. Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to rise today to join the com-munity of Middlefield, Connecticut in extending my congratulations to the Lyman family as they mark the 275th Anniversary of Lyman Or-chards—a very special milestone for this won-derful community treasure. The story of Lyman Orchards begins in 1741 when John and Hope Lyman purchased thirty-seven acres of land and started the fam-ily farm. Eight generations later, Lyman Or-chards remains family-run and is, in fact, the 12th oldest family run business still in oper-ation in the United States. Over its 275-year history, Lyman Orchards has grown and today encompasses over 1,100 acres of land where it produces over one hundred varieties of fruit and is home to the Apple Barrel where shoppers can pur-chase produce from the farm as well as prod-ucts created by that produce like their famous high-top apple pie, cider donuts, and fresh apple cider. Families can enjoy the ‘‘pick-your- own’’ opportunities, a business model that Lyman Orchards was the first to introduce in 1966. From apples and pumpkins in the fall to strawberries, blueberries, and raspberries in the early summer and peaches, nectarines, and pears in the late summer, you can pick your own favorites nearly all year long.

More recently, Lyman Orchards has added attractions like the Corn Maze and Sunflower Maze the proceeds from which are donated to the American Cancer Society and the Con-necticut Children’s Medical Center respec-tively. There is the Paint the Pumpkin Pink event that raises money for the Middlesex Comprehensive Breast Center and the Sun-shine Kids Road Race that benefits children with cancer. Lyman Orchards is also home to two 18-hole golf courses and a golf training center. Designed by legendary Hall of Fame architect Robert Trent Jones and Hall of Fame golfer Gary Player, these championship golf courses are both ranked among the best in the Northeast. During my tenure in Congress, I have had many opportunities to visit Lyman Orchards and have always been in awe of their forward- thinking vision, always coupled with their com-mitment to preserving and celebrating their rich history. Rooted, both literally and figu-ratively, in the Middlefield community, Lyman Orchards and the Lyman family are not only a part of the fabric of Middlefield, they are a warp thread—a vertical thread that forms the base of the fabric’s weave. Theirs is a story that is a reflection of the history not only of Connecticut, but of New England. I am proud to stand today to offer my heartfelt congratula-tions to John Lyman, III and the entire Lyman family as they mark the 275th Anniversary of Lyman Orchards and extend my very best wishes for continued success.

IN HONOR OF POTOMAC FALLS GIRLS’ LACROSSE TEAM 
HON. BARBARA COMSTOCK 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, June 20, 2016 Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the girls’ lacrosse team from Poto-mac Falls in my District who recently won the 2016 5A Virginia State Championship. They practiced long hours as a team, and this ex-traordinary achievement shows how far dedi-cation, hard work, and commitment to team-work can take a group as they played against some of the best competition in the nation. The Potomac Falls girls’ lacrosse team has made Virginia’s 10th Congressional District proud and they have represented us well. Winning a state championship attests to their impressive athletic ability, unselfish mentality, and determination to succeed. I commend them for their tireless dedication to both their school and their teammates, without neither of which this could have been possible. It takes a delicate combination of superior skill and many hours of practice to win a state title. The Potomac Falls girls’ lacrosse team has cer-tainly earned this honor and the lessons learned over the years will valuably serve them as they continue on in their lives. In the 5A state title game, the Potomac Falls girls’ lacrosse team beat George Mar-shall by double digits to claim the title that eluded them last year. Their victory was never in question as they quickly scored five goals in the opening minutes to pull ahead to a lead that grew to 12 by the game’s end. Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in honoring the Potomac Falls girls’ la-crosse team for their achievement and rep-resenting Virginia’s 10th Congressional District with such distinction. I wish them all the best in their future endeavors. f 
COMMEMORATING JUNETEENTH 2016 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, June 20, 2016 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, on June 19, 1865, General Gordon Granger rode into Galveston, Texas and announced the freedom of the last American slaves; belatedly freeing 250,000 slaves in Texas nearly two and a half years after Abraham Lincoln signed the Eman-cipation Proclamation. Juneteenth was first celebrated in the Texas state capital in 1867 under the direction of the Freedmen’s Bureau. Today, Juneteenth remains the oldest known celebration of slavery’s demise. It com-memorates freedom while acknowledging the sacrifices and contributions made by coura-geous African Americans towards making our great nation the more conscious and accept-ing country that it has become. This year, I introduced H. Res. 787, a reso-lution commemorating Juneteenth Independ-ence Day, which is co-sponsored by 57 of my colleagues. In introducing this Resolution, I acknowl-edge Texas State Representative Al Edwards and all Houstonians who honor Juneteenth as well or all who celebrate this freedom day. Because it was only after that day in 1865 when General Granger rode into Galveston, Texas, on the heels of the most devastating conflict in our country’s history, in the after-math of a civil war that pitted brother against brother, neighbor against neighbor and threat-ened to tear the fabric of our union apart for-ever that America truly became the land of the free and the home of the brave. Not until 1980, a year after my friend, State Representative Al Edwards, introduced a bill in the Texas Legislature did Juneteenth become a Texas state holiday. Civil rights pioneer Martin Luther King Jr. once said, ‘‘Freedom is never free,’’ and Afri-can American labor leader A. Phillip Randolph often said ‘‘Freedom is never given. It is won.’’ We should all recognize the power and the ironic truth of those statements and we should pause to remember the enormous price paid by all Americans in our country’s quest to real-ize its promise. Juneteenth honors the end of the 400 years of suffering African Americans endured under slavery and celebrates the legacy of persever-ance that has become the hallmark of the Afri-can American experience in the struggle for equality. Throughout the 1980’s and 90’s Juneteenth has continued to enjoy a growing and healthy interest from communities and organizations throughout the country. Institutions such as the Smithsonian, the Henry Ford Museum and others have begun sponsoring Juneteenth-centered activities. In recent years, a number of National Juneteenth Organizations have arisen to take their place alongside older organizations—all with the mission to promote and cultivate knowledge and appreciation of African Amer-ican history and culture. Juneteenth today, celebrates African Amer-ican freedom while encouraging self-develop-ment and respect for all cultures. As it takes on a more national and even global perspective, the events of 1865 in Texas are not forgotten, for all of the roots tie back to this fertile soil from which a national day of pride is growing. The future of Juneteenth looks bright as the number of cities and states come on board and form local committees and organizations to coordinate the activities.

RECOGNIZING THE 75TH ANNIVER-SARY OF BOY SCOUT TROOP 24 
HON. MICHAEL G. FITZPATRICK 
OF PENNSYLVANIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, June 20, 2016 Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 75th Anniversary of Boy Scout Troop 24. This 75th Anniversary of Troop 24 is a true milestone for one of the largest Boy Scout troops in the Lenape District of the Wash-ington Crossing Council. Congratulations to the Scouts, past and present, and the leaders who have encouraged and guided young men from the troop’s inception in 1941. The nick-name ‘‘Pioneers’’ was chosen in the earliest days, an appropriate choice knowing the troop pursues many outdoor camping and high ad-venture experiences. Scouting produces lead-ers and trailblazers, much like the early pio-neers and modern pioneers who are blazing new trails in space, science and more. The troop first organized in Morrisville, Bucks County, in 1929 and became the official Troop 24 in 1941, sponsored by Doylestown Pres-byterian Church. Troop 24 can be proud of its history and the dedication of all its young men, including 154 who achieved the rank of Eagle Scout. Best wishes for many more years of great adventure and outstanding leadership.

COMMEMORATING THE 72ND ANNI-VERSARY OF D-DAY AND RE-MEMBERING THE MEMBERS OF THE GREATEST GENERATION WHO SAVED FREEDOM IN THE WORLD 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, June 20, 2016 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, two weeks ago, June 6, marked the 72nd anniver-sary of D-Day, the Allied Forces’ audacious amphibious landing at Normandy, France, on June 6, 1944. ‘‘Operation Overlord,’’ as D-Day was for-mally known, was the largest single amphib-ious assault in the history of warfare. The success of D-Day, which was far from certain at the outset, led to the liberation of Western Europe, signaled the death knell of the German Wehrmacht, and paved the way to unconditional victory by the Allied Forces over the evils of Nazism, fascism, and Japa-nese imperialism. It is no exaggeration to say that D-Day changed the course of human history. The aim of the meticulously planned D-Day operation was to open a second front in the European war theater from which the Allied Forces could attack the German army and push east to capture Berlin. With the Russian Army advancing from the east, coupled with the southern front opened by the Allied invasion of Italy from North Africa in 1942, the opening of a western front would set in motion the pincer movement that would catch the German Army in a trap from which there would be no escape. The formidable German Army expected that the Allied Forces would try to launch an inva-sion from the western beaches of France, they just did not know when or where. So in anticipation of an Allied invasion, the Nazis constructed the infamous Atlantic Wall, an extensive system of coastal fortifications built along the western coast of Europe and Scandinavia. Under the direction of Field Marshal Rom-mel, the Atlantic Wall was reinforced by the addition of concrete pillboxes built along the beaches to house machine guns, antitank guns and light artillery. Mines and antitank obstacles were planted on the beaches themselves and underwater obstacles and mines were placed in waters just off shore. By the time of the D-Day landing, the Nazis had laid almost six million mines in northern France. And awaiting Allied soldiers who made their way onto and away from the beaches were gun emplacements and minefields extended inland. ‘‘War is hell,’’ said General William Tecum-seh Sherman during the Civil War. And that is an apt description of what await-ed the brave Allied warriors who set sail from England to the beaches of Normandy in the early morning of June 6, 1944, at the begin-ning of what has rightly been called ‘‘The Longest Day.’’ But they were buoyed in their resolve by the millions of prayers from Americans and others back home, of all races, religions, and creeds, invoking the Lord’s blessing, mercy, and grace. With the outcome in doubt, President Frank-lin Roosevelt asked the nation to join him in this solemn prayer: ‘‘Almighty God: Our sons, pride of our na-tion, this day have set upon a mighty endeav-or, a struggle to preserve our Republic, our re-ligion, and our civilization, and to set free a suffering humanity. ‘‘Lead them straight and true; give strength to their arms, stoutness to their hearts, stead-fastness in their faith. ‘‘They will need Thy blessings. ‘‘For these men are lately drawn from the ways of peace. ‘‘They fight not for the lust of conquest. ‘‘They fight to end conquest. ‘‘They fight to liberate. ‘‘They fight to let justice arise, and tolerance and goodwill among all Thy people. ‘‘They yearn but for the end of battle, for their return to the haven of home.’’ The prayers were needed because the cost of D-Day was high; U.S. casualties on D-Day totaled more than 2,499 dead, 3,184 wound-ed, 1,928 missing, and 26 captured. Our British and Canadian allies suffered ter-rible losses on D-Day as well: approximately 2,700 for the British and 946 for the Cana-dians. German casualties are estimated at 4,000 to 9,000. In total, the number of combatants killed, wounded or missing in the Battle of Normandy for both sides exceeded 425,000, not including the estimated 15,000 to 20,000 French civil-ians killed. But the operation was a success. More than 156,000 troops or paratroopers came ashore on D-Day, 73,000 from the U.S., 83,000 from Great Britain and Canada. By the end of June 11, D-Day+5, 326,547 troops, 54,186 vehicles and 104,428 tons of supplies had come ashore. And with them the seeds for the victory in Europe that would come less than a year later, on May 8, 1945, with the fall of Berlin and the unconditional surrender of the Nazis. On the eve of the Normandy invasion, Gen-eral Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces, addressed the soldiers, sailors, and airmen of the Allied Expeditionary Forces and said to them that they were about to embark upon a ‘‘Great Crusade,’’ and that the ‘‘eyes of the world’’ were upon them. He told them that their task would not be easy because the ‘‘enemy is well trained, well equipped and battle-hardened. He will fight savagely.’’ But, General Eisenhower said, ‘‘this is the year 1944. The tide has turned. The free men of the world are marching together to victory.’’ And march to victory they did, fully justifying General Eisenhower’s ‘‘confidence in their courage, devotion to duty, and skill in battle.’’ Because of the heroism of these men who willingly risked their lives to be the tip of the spear of liberty, the war was won and a world was saved for freedom. Mr. Speaker, D-Day was, and remains, a day like no other in the history of man’s so-journ on earth. We remember Gettysburg. There, President Lincoln paid tribute to those ‘‘who gave their lives so that the nation might live.’’ And it is equally fitting and proper that we remember D-Day. And that we continue to honor those who risked all and gave all so that the world could remain free. f
