PERSONAL EXPLANATION 
HON. JOSEPH P. KENNEDY, III 
OF MASSACHUSETTS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Thursday, December 31, 2015 
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, on December 
18, 2015, I was unable to vote on Roll Call 705. 
If I had been present, I would have sup-
ported H.R. 2029, the fiscal year 2016 omni-bus spending legislation. 
I would have voted in favor of this legislation 
because it includes necessary funding to keep the government operating. It provides needed clarifications to ensure the work of the Na-tional Network for Manufacturing Innovation coordinates among existing manufacturing in-stitutes and moves forward in the investment of new centers. Additionally it includes an in-crease, over 2015 enacted levels, of $2 billion for the National Institutes of Health and $132 million for the Food and Drug Administration. The legislation provides a $6.4 billion increase for veterans services and a one-time appro-priation for international food aid. Finally, the AmeriCorps program will receive $368 million, which is a 15% increase over last year’s fund-
ing levels. 
However no compromise bill is ever perfect, 
and I am disappointed that the bill fails to lift the ban prohibiting the Centers for Disease Control from researching the impact of gun vi-olence.

CALLING FOR AN END TO THE 
TRADE EMBARGO WITH CUBA 
HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO 
OF CONNECTICUT  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Thursday, December 31, 2015 
Ms. D ELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to ex-
press my support for the continued normaliza-tion of relations with Cuba and ending the em-
bargo. Today marks the one year anniversary since the historic announcement by President Obama that the Cold War relations between the U.S. and Cuba were officially coming to an end. 
The reestablishment of diplomatic relations 
and increase in travel, commerce, information flows, and research collaboration will improve 
the lives of both the Cuban and American people. In the past year we have seen re-markable progress. Cuba has been removed from the list of state sponsors of terror, so that the State Department can more appropriately focus its resources on countries and regions where counter-terrorism efforts are critical. Embassies have been reopened in Wash-ington and Havana. The Treasury and Com-merce Departments continue to implement changes to make it easier to travel between our nations. 
These efforts are critical steps to improve 
relations between the United States and the Cuban people but more must be done. The trade embargo, in place since 1960, must come to an end. This misguided policy to pressure the Cuban government into democ-racy has clearly failed. The President has pur-sued normalization of relations to the greatest extent possible under the law. Now, Congress must act. 
Removing the embargo with Cuba could 
generate up to $365 million in additional American goods and would help to create thousands of new jobs in the United States, according to a study by Texas A&M Univer-sity. 
Last year on official visit to the island nation, 
I saw firsthand the innovative power of Cuban entrepreneurs, especially women who are opening small businesses, restaurants, and shops for the first time across the island. We can and should continue to build momentum for economic liberalization so that these women can access the tools and capital they need to expand and grow their enterprises. I am proud to be a founding member of the 
re-launched bipartisan Cuba Working Group steering committee. It is time to support the Cuban people and create jobs here in the United States. I urge action in this body to re-move the embargo so that we can fully en-gage with our neighbors across the Straits of Florida.

HONORING THE EAST NICOLAUS 
HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL TEAM 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Thursday, December 31, 2015 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate the East Nicolaus High School Spartans for winning the Northern California championship, advancing to the CIF Division VI-AA Championship Game to be played in San Diego on December 19, 2015. 
Under the leadership of Coach Travis Bark-
er, this school of 250 students from Trow-bridge in Sutter County will be making a road trip of over 500 miles to face a school four times their size. 
They may be underdogs in this champion-
ship game, but this team and these players are tough. They have proven their worth throughout the season. They are prepared and disciplined, and will represent Sutter County well. 
The Spartans have had an incredible sea-
son, and I wish them the best of luck in the championship game.
